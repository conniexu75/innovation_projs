https://openalex.org/W2051258629,"A growing body of evidence supports a role for mitochondria and mitochondria-derived factors in the cell death process. In particular, much attention has focused on cytochromec, a key component of the electron transport chain, that has been reported to translocate from the mitochondria to the cytosol in cells undergoing apoptosis. The mechanism for this release is, as yet, unknown. Here we report that ectopic expression of Bax induces apoptosis with an early release of cytochrome c preceding many apoptosis-associated morphological alterations as well as caspase activation and subsequent substrate proteolysis. A loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential was detected in vivo, although no mitochondrial swelling or loss of transmembrane potential was observed in isolated mitochondria treated with Bax in vitro. Caspase inhibitors, such as endogenous XIAP and synthetic peptide benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (zVAD-fmk), although capable of altering the kinetics and perhaps mode of cell death, had no influence on this release, suggesting that if cytochromec plays a role in caspase activation it must precede this step in the apoptotic process. Mitochondrial permeability transition was also shown to be significantly prevented by caspase inhibition, indicating that the translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol is not a consequence of events requiring mitochondrial membrane depolarization. In contrast, Bcl-xL was capable of preventing cytochrome c release while also significantly inhibiting cell death. It would therefore appear that the mitochondrial release of factors such as cytochrome c represents a critical step in committing a cell to death, and this release is independent of permeability transition and caspase activation but is inhibited by Bcl-xL.

The stereotypical death throes of a cell undergoing apoptosis include DNA fragmentation, nuclear condensation, cell shrinkage, blebbing, and phosphatidylserine externalization (1Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H.

A large body of evidence supports the idea that these events are mediated by the activation of several cytosolic proteases, the caspases, which then orchestrate apoptosis via the cleavage of key substrates (reviewed in Refs. 4Martin S.J.

For example, specific cleavage of two such substrates, PAK2 and DNA fragmentation factor, activate these proteins, mediating membrane blebbing and DNA fragmentation, respectively, without further requirements for the proteases (for these events) (8Rudel T.

Recent studies have delineated one key mechanism responsible for initiating the executioner phase of apoptosis. Early in the process, mitochondria release cytochrome c (10Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4463) Google Scholar), which upon entry into the cytosol forms a complex with another molecule, Apaf-1 (11Vaux D.L.

Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6239) Google Scholar). In the presence of dATP or ATP, this complex processes and activates the caspase, which in turn can now trigger a cascade by processing and activating other caspases (in particular, caspases-3, -6, and -7) (13Li P.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These then cleave key substrates and coordinate the process of apoptotic cell death. Bax is a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-family protein (15Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5865) Google Scholar, 16Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). Recently, Bax has been shown to induce cytochromec release and caspase activation in vivo (19Rosse T. Olivier R. Monney L. Rager M. Conus S. Fellay I. Jansen B. Borner C. Nature. 1998; 391: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar) andin vitro (20Jürgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). This release was reportedly dependent upon induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition, an event that is associated with disruption of the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) (21Pastorino J.G.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in a variety of apoptotic phenomena (22Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M.

Med. 1996; 184: 1155-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 was found to be capable of inhibiting Bax-induced apoptosis but not Bax-induced cytochromec release in cells (19Rosse T. Olivier R. Monney L. Rager M. Conus S. Fellay I. Jansen B. Borner C. Nature. 1998; 391: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). In contrast, Bcl-2 has been shown to be capable of blocking spontaneous cytochrome c release in cell-free extracts and in cells treated with apoptosis-inducing agents (26Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar, 27Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). In the former, cytochrome c was able to completely bypass the anti-apoptotic effects of Bcl-2 (27Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in both cell-free systems and in cells undergoing apoptosis, the release of cytochromec can occur independently of changes in ΔΨm. We therefore examined the ability of Bax to induce the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis and evaluated the relationships between caspase activation, ΔΨm, and the effects of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-family proteins. Human embryonic kidney cells (293T cells) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine under standard conditions. CEM cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin.

(Seattle, WA). Thrombin protease and glutathione-Sepharose-4B columns were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. 293T cells were plated at 1 × 106/100-mm dish on day 0. On day 2, medium was changed, and cells were incubated for an additional 3 h. Cells were then transfected for 6 h using calcium phosphate, after which cells were washed with PBS, and fresh medium was added. Cells were harvested at various time points post-transfection. The amount of DNA in all transfection experiments was made equal by including respective amounts of vector. 293T cells were collected by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.2, followed by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 500 μl of extraction buffer containing 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 50 mm Pipes-KOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. After a 30-min incubation on ice, cells were homogenized using a glass dounce and a B pestle (80 strokes). Cell homogenates were spun at 14 000 × g for 15 min, and supernatants were removed and stored at −80 °C until analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Between 15–35 μg of cytosolic protein extract was boiled for 5 min and loaded. Samples were resolved under reducing conditions for 2 h at 80 V on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described previously. Separated proteins were then blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride and nitrocellulose membranes at 120 mA overnight. The membranes were blocked for 2 h in PBST (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween) containing 5% nonfat dried milk and then probed overnight with an appropriate dilution of the primary antibody. Reactions were detected with suitable secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Nuclei from apoptotic cells undergoing DNA fragmentation contain subdiploid amounts of DNA and were therefore quantified by cell cycle analysis as described previously (28Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar). Morphological changes such as cell shrinkage, rounding, and membrane blebbing were evaluated by microscopic inspection of cells under phase contrast. Nuclear changes such as chromatin condensation and fragmentation and DEVD-like caspase activity were analyzed by staining with DAPI and Phiphilux-G6D2, respectively. Phiphilux-G6D2 is a fluorogenic substrate that is cleaved in a DEVD-dependent manner to produce rhodamine molecules, which fluoresce red under G2A filter, whereas DAPI stains nuclei (apoptotic or viable) blue under DAPI filter. Briefly, cells were plated on poly(d-lysine)-coated coverslips at 4 × 105/well in a 6-well plate 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of green fluorescent protein and 2 μg of pcDNA3.Bax or empty vector as described above. Cells were analyzed at 18 h post-transfection. Cells were washed twice in PBS and then incubated in Phiphilux-G6D2 (10 μm) at 37 °C for 1 h in the dark. Cells were then washed twice in PBS and stained for 3 min with DAPI (5 μm) at room temperature in 3.7% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then rinsed twice in PBS, mounted in PBS, and viewied by fluorescence microscopy. Changes in the inner mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) were determined by incubating 1 × 105 cells in 40 nm of DiOC6 (3Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Scie R.C.A.A. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar) or 150 nm MitoTracker Orange for 20 min at 37 °C. These two fluorochromes incorporate into cells dependent upon their mitochondrial transmembrane potential (29Petit P.X. O'Conner J.E. Grunwald D. Brown S.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The cells were then scored using FACScan flow cytometery (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Controls were performed in the presence of 50 μm mitochondrial uncoupling agent mCICCP. In all cases, cells were gated to exclude cellular debris associated with necrosis. Assessment of mitochondrial transmembrane potential in isolated mitochondria was carried out by incubating 0.2 μg of mitochondria (prepared as described below) in 80 nm Rh123 and scoring immediately by FACScan flow cytometery. Controls were performed in the presence of FCCP (1 μm). DH-5α bacterial cells containing a pGEX-KG expression vector with the murine Bax protein lacking the C-terminal hydrophobic region (BaxΔC19, amino acids 1–173) were treated with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside for 4–6 h at 30 °C. Bacterial cell pellets were lysed in 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin in PBS and sonicated for 4 min on ice (output 6.5; duty 90%). Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 20 000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose-4B column and the column washed with PBS. Bound GST-Bax protein was eluted from the column by thrombin protease treatment (10 units/liter). The eluate was incubated with 80 μg/mlN α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone protease inhibitor and dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmEDTA. Mitochondria were isolated from liver tissue of 6-week-old Balb/c mice. Briefly, the livers were taken and homogenized with a Teflon glass potter in Buffer A (0.2 m mannitol, 0.05 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmKCl, 5 mm succinate, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). All steps were then carried out at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 1,030 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to another tube and centrifuged at 3,300 × g for an additional 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in Buffer B (0.3 m mannitol, 5 mmpotassium phosphate, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and centrifuged at 1,030 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 3 300 ×g for 10 min. Finally mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in MSH buffer containing an ATP regenerating system (210 mmmannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EGTA, 5 mm succinate, pH 7.0, 0.15% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, 1 mmdATP, 10 μm phosphocreatine, 50 μg/ml creatine kinase, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The freshly isolated mitochondria were then incubated with recombinant Bax protein in the presence or absence of S-100 cytosolic extract. After 5 to 60 min at 37 °C, mitochondria were removed by centrifugation at 20 000 ×g, and supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Jurkat cells were grown for 3 days. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 20 mmextraction buffer (Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium-EDTA, 1 mm sodium-EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm succinate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), incubated for 30 min on ice, and lysed by homogenization using a glass dounce (40 strokes/B-pestle). Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were re-centrifuged at 100 000 × g for 1 h in an Ultracentrifuge, and the resulting S-100 extracts were stored at −70 °C. 100 μg of freshly isolated mitochondria protein was incubated with various amounts of Bax protein in 500 μl of MSH buffer containing an ATP regenerating system, andA 520 was measured over time (20Jürgensmeier J.M.

As controls for mitochondrial swelling atractyloside (5 mm in Me2SO) and CaCl2 (100 μm) were used. Bax promotes apoptosis induced by removal of growth factors and other stimuli (15Oltvai Z.N.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 461-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 35Xiang X. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To confirm this, we transfected 293T cells with a construct for expression of Bax together with one for expression of green fluorescent protein (37Pines J. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 326-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We monitored caspase activation in individual cells using a cell-permeable, fluorescent substrate (as described under “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 1 A, Bax-transfected cells exhibited both morphological and biochemical characteristics of apoptosis. Cells induced to die upon Bax expression appeared rounded and blebbed while displaying condensed chromatin, fragmented nuclei, and active DEVD-cleaving caspases. We then examined whether expression of Bax could induce the release of mitochondrial cytochromec. Fig. 1 B shows that as the levels of Bax protein increased, cytochrome c could be detected in the cytosol. In other experiments including earlier time points before 9 h (not shown), negligible Bax expression was observed with neither cytochrome c nor caspase activation detectable. We previously observed that the release of cytochrome cinduced by staurosporine or UVB irradiation occurs before and independently of caspase activation and subsequent apoptosis (38Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1997; 17: 37-49Crossref Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). To examine this with respect to Bax-induced cytochrome crelease, we treated Bax-transfected cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk. As described by others (39Loddick S.A. MacKenzie A. Rothwell N.J. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 1465-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 40Rodriguez I. Matsuura K. Ody C. Nagata S. Vassalli P. J. Exp.

Zhu H. Chow S.C. MacFarlane M. Nicholson D.W. Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), zVAD-fmk significantly inhibited apoptosis during the period studied (24 h) (Fig. 2 A). As shown in Fig.2 B, this was not because of any effect on Bax expression levels. Bax-induced apoptosis corresponded to the activation of caspases and the subsequent cleavage of fodrin and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, two caspase substrates previously shown to be cleaved during apoptosis (44Martin S.J. O'Brien G.A. Nishioka W.K. McGahon A.J. Mahboubi A. Saido T. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6425-6428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), whereas the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk efficiently blocked this. Nevertheless, Bax-induced cytochromec release proceeded with the same kinetics with or without caspase inhibition (Fig. 2 B) as measured by cell fractionation and immunoblot analysis. This was confirmed by densitometric analysis of the cytochrome c immunoblots. At all time points, the cytosolic cytochrome c in the presence of Bax plus zVAD-fmk was ≥ that of Bax alone (data not shown).Figure 2Caspase inhibitors block Bax-induced apoptosis but have no effect on the kinetics of cytochrome crelease.

D, cells were either treated with zVAD-fmk or co-transfected with XIAP and analyzed by immunoblot for cytochromec release and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage after 18 h of Bax expression. 5 μg of isolated mitochondria fraction (Mito. Fr.) was used as a positive control for cytochrome c staining. Actin was used as loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As another approach to inhibiting caspase activation, we co-transfected Bax and a construct for expression of XIAP. Recent studies have shown that this molecule is a potent inhibitor of caspase function, including caspase activation by cytochrome c (45Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, XIAP coexpression completely blocked apoptotic cell death (Fig.2 C) and caspase substrate cleavage (Fig. 2 D) triggered by Bax. Nevertheless, XIAP expression had no effect on Bax-induced cytochrome c release (Fig. 2 D). Once again zVAD-fmk was demonstrated to be capable of blocking caspase activation but had no effect on cytochrome c release. Cell-free systems have been extremely valuable for the analysis of apoptosis mechanisms, including cytochrome c release from mitochondria (9Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

We therefore asked whether recombinant Bax protein can induce cytochrome c releasein vitro and whether this is a direct or indirect effect of the protein. As shown in Fig. 3, the addition of Bax to cytosolic extracts containing mitochondria induced a rapid release of cytochrome c. Similarly, the addition of Bax to isolated mitochondria rapidly induced cytochrome crelease, which was even more pronounced than that seen in the presence of cytosol. It appears, therefore, that this release is a direct effect of Bax on the mitochondria, as observed by others (19Rosse T. Olivier R. Monney L. Rager M. Conus S. Fellay I. Jansen B. Borner C. Nature. 1998; 391: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 20Jürgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is possible that this can be simply explained by levels of inhibitors in the cytosol, such as Bcl-2 or other Bax-binding proteins, which may sequester Bax and thereby interfere with its activity. In many systems, apoptosis is associated with a loss of mitochondrial inner membrane p"

Here, we have analyzed lipid assemblies in three different viruses: fowl plague virus (FPV) from the influenza virus family, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and Semliki Forest virus (SFV). Analysis of detergent extractability of proteins, cholesterol, phosphoglycerolipids, and sphingomyelin in virions showed that FPV contains high amounts of detergent-insoluble complexes, whereas such complexes are largely absent from VSV or SFV. Cholesterol depletion from the viral envelope by methyl-β-cyclodextrin results in increased solubility of sphingomyelin and of the glycoproteins in the FPV envelope. This biochemical behavior suggests that so-called raft-lipid domains are selectively incorporated into the influenza virus envelope. The “fluidity” of the FPV envelope, as measured by the fluorescence polarization of diphenylhexatriene, was significantly lower than compared with VSV or SFV. Furthermore, influenza virus hemagglutinin incorporated into the envelope of recombinant VSV was largely detergent-soluble, indicating the depletion of raft-lipid assemblies from this membrane. The results provide a model for lipid selectivity during virus budding and support the view of lipid rafts as cholesterol-dependent, ordered domains in biological membranes.

The hypothesis that lipids from the plasma membrane are not randomly included into the viral envelope, but that budding could occur from specialized domains of the membrane, was put forward several years ago (1Lenard J. Compans R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 344: 51-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 2Pessin J.E. Glaser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9044-9050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparing the lipid composition of various viruses with the composition of the host cell membrane, clear cut differences have been reported, although caution has to be exercised because viruses can be isolated practically pure, whereas plasma membrane fractions cannot be (2Pessin J.E. Glaser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9044-9050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Renkonen O. Kääräinen L. Simons K. Gahmberg C.G.

Thus, the role of lipid domains has remained controversial and has not so far been given functional significance. New insights into the mechanisms of domain formation in biological membranes have come from the analysis of detergent-resistant membrane fractions (5Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that laterally associating sphingolipids and cholesterol form small ordered domains, called rafts, which are resistant to extraction with Triton X-100 at 4 °C. These domains can incorporate specific proteins and function as platforms for intracellular sorting and signal transduction events (6Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 7Brown D.A. London E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Recently, the concentration of GPI1-anchored proteins in microdomains has been confirmed in living cells by biophysical and biochemical methods without the use of detergents (8Friedrichson T. Kurzchalia T. Nature. 1998; 394: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 9Varma R. Mayor S. Nature. 1998; 394: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). However, when GPI-anchored proteins on the apical surface of epithelial cells were analyzed, no such concentration could be observed (10Kenworthy A.K. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy is not known, yet one explanation could be that this membrane represents a continuous raft domain in contrast to the plasma membrane of nonpolarized cells, where raft domains would be noncontinuous (6Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 10Kenworthy A.K. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 11Vaz W.L.C. Almeida P.F.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 482-488Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that cholesterol promotes the detergent insolubility of GPI-anchored proteins or transmembrane proteins both in cellular membranes and in artificial lipid vesicles (12Cerneus D.P. Ueffing E. Posthuma G. Strous G.J. van der Ende A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3150-3155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Pagano R.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Lipids recovered in detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched complexes (DIGs) were shown to have higher melting temperatures than the average lipids from the plasma membrane, suggesting that raft-domains might be formed from lipids with preferentially saturated acyl chains (16Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Interestingly, for artificial lipid vesicles detergent insolubility could be correlated with the formation of a liquid-ordered phase in the membrane (15Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 17Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), suggesting that phase separation might be the basis for the formation of insoluble lipid rafts in biological membranes (7Brown D.A. London E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 18Rietveld A. Simons K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Also, specific viral glycoproteins have been described to be associated with raft domains during transport to the cell surface. Both the influenza virus neuraminidase and hemagglutinin are recovered in DIGs after entering the Golgi complex (19Skibbens J.E. Roth M.G. Matlin K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 20Kundu A. Avalos R.T. Sanderson C.M. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6508-6515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Efficient surface transport of influenza virus HA requires cholesterol, and the protein stays raft-associated at the plasma membrane (14Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5501-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 21Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Here we used membranes of baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells and the viral envelopes of influenza fowl plague virus (FPV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and Semliki Forest virus (SFV) as model systems to analyze the formation of detergent-resistant lipid domains in a biological membrane. Our results demonstrate that the viruses contain lipid raft assemblies to a very different extent. Furthermore, we show that in all of the membranes analyzed cholesterol is required for the formation of detergent-insoluble lipid complexes and that such complexes are highly ordered. Our results therefore support a model in which cholesterol promotes the formation of lipid domains that become selectively incorporated into the influenza envelope. BHK cells (strain CCL10, American Culture Collection) were maintained in G-MEM (5% FCS, 10% tryptosephosphate 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. Virus stocks of influenza virus (strain A/FPV), VSV, SFV, and the recombinant VSV-HA (22Kretzschmar E. Buonocore L.M.J. Schnell M.J. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5982-5989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were produced as described before (23Matlin K.S. Simons K. Cell. 1983; 34: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 24Bennett M. Wandinger-Ness A. Simons K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4075-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). From BHK cells, a light membrane fraction was prepared essentially as described (25Kurzchalia T.V. Dupree P. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Virta H. Lehnert M. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized with a syringe under a nitrogen atmosphere. A postnuclear supernatant was adjusted to 1.5 m sucrose and overlayered with 1.2 and 0.8 m sucrose. After centrifugation for 4 h (45,000 rpm, 4 °C in a SW40 rotor, Beckman), membranes were recovered from the 1.2/0.8 minterface. For radioactive labeling, cells on one 10-cm culture dish were incubated for 4 h with 25 μCi of [1α,2α-3H]cholesterol (48 Ci/mmol) in infection medium (see below) or for 36 h with 80 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate in G-MEM without tryptose phosphate. To analyze membranes after viral infection, the cells were harvested 6 h postinfection and processed as above. For the analysis of proteins, lipids, and DPH polarization, the viruses were grown in BHK cells. For the production of nonlabeled viruses, cells from three overconfluent 80-cm2 flasks were trypsinized and seeded in 10 275-cm2 flasks. After 36 h, viruses were adsorbed to the 90% confluent cells (2 × 108 plaque-forming units/flask) in infection medium (MEM; 0.2% BSA, 10 mmHepes, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) for 1 h. The inoculum was removed and replaced by infection medium. After 24 h, the medium was collected and centrifuged two times to remove cell debris (1500 rpm, 4 °C, Heraeus centrifuge). The supernatant was then layered on top of a step gradient in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (TN) consisting of 3 ml of 55% (w/v) sucrose and 10 ml of 10% (w/v) sucrose in a SW28 centrifuge tube. After a 2-h centrifugation at 25,000 rpm and 4 °C, the 55/10% interface was collected, diluted 3-fold in TN, and then applied on an 8-ml 50% (w/v) glycerol cushion in TN. After a 2-h spin (25,000 rpm, 4 °C) in a SW28 rotor, the supernatant was discarded, and the virus pellet was resuspended in TN buffer overnight at 4 °C. A preparation from 10 275-cm2 flasks routinely yielded 1–2 mg of viral protein for FPV and VSV and about 0.2 mg for SFV. Radiolabeled viruses were produced following essentially the same protocol in smaller scale using two 10-cm tissue culture dishes. Two hours postinfection, the cells were labeled with 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine in medium containing 5 μmunlabeled methionine. For labeling with [1α,2α-3H]cholesterol (48 Ci/mmol), cells were preincubated for 4 h with 50 μCi of [3H]cholesterol/dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (0.1% ethanol, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Subsequently, cells were washed twice with infection medium, and viruses were adsorbed and collected as described above. For labeling with 32P, cells on two 10-cm tissue culture dishes were incubated with 750 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate/dish for 30 h in G-MEM without tryptose phosphate. Then cells were washed, and viruses were adsorbed and collected. Aliquots of virus or membrane preparations with a total lipid content smaller than 1 μg were extracted with 50 μl of 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA (TXNE) on ice for 20 min. In pelleting experiments, the extract was spun in a TLA-100 centrifuge (Beckman) in a TLA100 rotor for 20 min at 80,000 rpm and 4 °C. Proteins in supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Alternatively, lipids from pellet and supernatant fractions were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (26Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and subsequently analyzed by thin layer chromatography on silica plates (Kieselgel 60; Merck) with chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8, v/v/v) as a solvent. Radiolabeled 32P-containing lipids were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Relative amounts of [3H]cholesterol were quantified by scintillation counting. For flotation gradients, virus aliquots containing 10 μg of protein were extracted with 250 μl of TXNE on ice for 20 min. Extracts were then brought to 40% Optiprep by the addition of 500 μl of Optiprep stock solution (Nycomed Pharma, Oslo, Norway), overlayered with 1.2 ml of 30% Optiprep in TXNE and 250 μl of TXNE. Samples were spun for 2 h in a TLS 55 rotor (50,000 rpm, 4 °C), and six fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. Proteins were precipitated from the fractions by the addition of one volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Extractions with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD; Sigma) were performed for 15 min at 37 °C in TN containing 5 mm EDTA and 10 μg/ml defatted BSA with gentle agitation. Subsequently, samples were cooled on ice and spun for 30 min in a TLA100 rotor (80,000 rpm, 4 °C). Virions were sedimented by centrifugation in a TLA45 rotor (20 min, 30,000 rpm, 4 °C), and negative staining was performed using glow-discharged carbon-coated Formvar grids and a 1% (w/v) solution of uranyl acetate (Sigma). Polarization measurements were performed essentially as described (16Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Virus preparations or lipid vesicles were resuspended in 100 μl of TN buffer, and 1 μl of DPH (Sigma) dissolved in tetrahydrofuran was added. Samples were incubated for 1 h in the dark, and DPH fluorescence intensity was measured at 25 °C in an AB2 luminescence spectrometer (SLM Aminco) equipped with Glan-Thompson polarizers (excitation wavelength, 359 nm; emission at 427 nm; band pass 4 nm). Lipid vesicles were prepared by sonication of 2 ml of 0.5 mg/ml PC from egg yolk (Sigma) or 0.5 mg/ml DPPC (Sigma) in TN buffer. Similar results were obtained using viruses or lipid vesicles at concentrations of 0.05–0.5 μg/ml and DPH at final concentrations of 50 nm to 1 μm. Fluorescence detected without DPH or without the addition of viruses was negligible. To study raft domains in different envelopes, the viruses were produced in BHK fibroblasts and isolated by gradient centrifugation. The obtained preparations were essentially pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Fig.1 A). The detergent solubility of the viral glycoproteins was analyzed by extraction with Triton X-100 on ice and centrifugation in Triton-containing density gradients. Influenza virus HA was floating to low density as observed before (14Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5501-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), whereas the VSV G or the SFV glycoproteins stayed in the bottom of the gradient, indicating that they were solubilized by the detergent (Fig.1 B). Therefore, association of a glycoprotein with rafts in the viral envelope is specific for influenza viruses and not a general phenomenon. Cholesterol is strongly enriched in detergent-insoluble fractions from cellular membranes (5Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the Triton solubility of cholesterol in the different viral envelopes and the host cell membrane. BHK cells were labeled with [3H]cholesterol, and viruses were produced and purified. The radiolabeled membranes were extracted with Triton X-100 on ice and centrifuged, and radioactivity in supernatant and pellet fractions was quantified by scintillation counting (material pelleted by this centrifugation at 178.000 ×g will be considered “insoluble”). For comparison, a [3H]cholesterol-labeled light membrane fraction from BHK cells was prepared and detergent-extracted. Strikingly, the cholesterol solubility showed large differences between the viruses analyzed (Fig.2 A). In the influenza viruses (FPVs) 41 ± 8% of the cholesterol was pelleted, in VSV 13 ± 6%, and in SFV only 5 ± 5%. Compared with the BHK light membrane fraction (enriched for the plasma membrane, endosomes, and Golgi membranes (27Harder T. Kellner R. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar)), cholesterol solubility in the influenza virus envelope is decreased and increased in VSV and SFV. It is important to note that the cholesterol solubility in membranes from virally infected BHK cells was not significantly changed in comparison with uninfected cells (data not shown). We next used CD to further analyze the extractability of cholesterol in the different viral envelopes. In contrast to detergents, incubation with low concentrations of CD leaves membranes intact and mediates selective efflux of sterols from the bilayer (28Kilsdonk E.P. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 29Klein U. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13784-13793Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). When [3H]cholesterol-labeled influenza viruses and VSV were treated with increasing concentrations of CD, cholesterol was more easily removed from the VSV envelope (Fig.2 B). For example, 1 mm CD extracted 70 ± 3% of cholesterol from VSV but only 43 ± 2% from the influenza virus particles. It should be noted that practically no further cholesterol efflux was observed when the extraction times were extended beyond 15 min (data not shown). During the extraction, the viral particles remained intact and did not show any dramatic structural changes as judged by negative staining and electron microscopy (Fig.3). The extractability of cholesterol by CD from the SFV envelope was found to be intermediate compared with the VSV and FPV envelope; however, the results were somewhat variable (data not shown). One possible explanation came from the morphological analysis of the extracted particles. In contrast to FPV and VSV, the structure of the SFV particles was affected upon cholesterol removal, and the particles were penetrated by the stain (Fig. 3 F). This might indicate a perturbation of the membrane and result in fragmentation of the particles, especially at higher CD concentrations. Instability of SFV particles has been observed before, when virions were produced in cholesterol-free insect cells (30Vashishtha M. Phalen T. Marquardt M.T. Ryu J.S. Ng A.C. Kielian M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, clearly cholesterol in influenza viruses is in a detergent-resistant state, whereas this is not the case for VSV and SFV.Figure 3Morphological analysis of viral particles after cholesterol depletion. FPV (A and B), VSV (C and D), and SFV (D andE) were incubated without (A, C, andE) or with 5 mm CD (B, D, and F) for 20 min at 37 °C and subsequently pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min (80,000 rpm, 4 °C, TLA100). The preparations were then observed in an electron microscope after negative staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The observed differences in cholesterol extractability could result from the inclusion of raft domains into the viral envelopes to differing extents. To test this hypothesis, viruses were produced in 32P-labeled BHK fibroblasts and detergent-extracted at 4 °C. Lipids from the soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by thin layer chromatography and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. The major 32P-labeled lipids detected in the BHK light membrane fraction were phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and sphingomyelin (SM) (Fig. 4 A). While PE and PC were largely solublized by Triton X-100, a fraction of the SM (41 ± 7%) was insoluble (as for the cholesterol extractability, no significant changes in the Triton X-100 solubility of 32P-labeled lipids were observed 6 h after viral infection; data not shown). However, the SM solubility in the viral envelopes showed dramatic differences. While in influenza viruses 70 ± 5% of the SM could be sedimented after detergent extraction, only 27 ± 7 or 15 ± 8% could be pelleted from VSV or SFV, respectively (Fig. 4 A). To analyze the cholesterol dependence of the lipid solubility, membranes or virus particles were preextracted with 5 mm CD. We chose this concentration because it allows the removal of 70–90% of the cholesterol but leaves the particles intact and results only in a minimal loss of 32P-labeled lipids (<5%) from the samples (data not shown). Insolubility of SM was cholesterol-dependent, since CD preextraction of the membranes resulted in increased solubilization, both in the FPV and VSV envelopes and in the BHK membrane fraction (Fig. 4 B, TableI). Also, the solubility of PC in the FPV envelope was strongly increased upon cholesterol removal (Table I). Therefore, cholesterol is not only required for the association of proteins with DIGs, but generally for the formation of detergent-insoluble lipid assemblies in a biological membrane. This also confirms that DIGs are not complexes coalescing from intrinsically insoluble components but that an interplay between different lipid species is required to form a detergent-resistant membrane.Table ITriton X-100 solubility of cholesterol (Chol), SM, PC, and PE in BHK membranes and viral envelopes, without or after (+CD) cholesterol depletion by 5 mm cyclodextrinMembraneSedimentability of lipidCholSMPCPE%BHK29 ± 341 ± 711 ± 24 ± 3+CD21 ± 210 ± 25 ± 2FPV41 ± 870 ± 537 ± 412 ± 3+CD20 ± 810 ± 52 ± 3VSV13 ± 627 ± 714 ± 25 ± 2+CD19 ± 510 ± 35 ± 4SFV4 ± 515 ± 814 ± 95 ± 5+CD24 ± 613 ± 53 ± 5The sedimentability of each lipid at 279,000 × g after Triton X-100 extraction is listed.

Results from at least three independent experiments with three independent determinations are given with S.D. values. Studies with artificial lipid vesicles demonstrated that membranes in the liquid-ordered phase and GPI-anchored proteins incorporated into these membranes are insoluble in Triton X-100 at 4 °C (16Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 17Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). It was therefore proposed that DIGs isolated from biological membranes might also be derived from domains in the liquid-ordered phase (7Brown D.A. London E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Fluorescence polarization of the dye DPH incorporated into membranes has been widely used as a measure of acyl chain order. Lipid vesicles containing detergent-insoluble lipids showed significantly higher fluorescence polarization than lipid vesicles from detergent-soluble lipid mixtures, supporting the idea of ordered domains as a basis for insolubility (16Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). While cellular membranes are heterogenous, viral envelopes provide a unique possibility to analyze DPH fluorescence polarization in a biological lipid bilayer. When DPH was incorporated into the envelopes of FPV, VSV, and SFV, the influenza virus showed the highest fluorescence polarization, whereas the lowest values were obtained for VSV (TableII). For comparison, DPPC and egg yolk PC vesicles prepared by sonication were analyzed. Clearly, all viral membranes show a higher fluorescence polarization than the egg yolk PC lipid vesicles, which are in the liquid crystalline phase. At 25 °C, the DPPC vesicles are in the gel phase (Tm = 41 °C) and accordingly show a very high fluorescence polarization (0.382). The values obtained for the FPV envelope are only slightly lower, suggesting a high degree of order in this envelope and strongly supporting the hypothesis that DIGs are derived from ordered domains in biological membranes. Rather surprisingly, the SFV envelope showed intermediate values between the VSV and FPV indicating a limited “fluidity,” although according to the detergent solubility of the lipids highly ordered lipid complexes were not detected (Table I). Most likely, this can be explained by the fact that SFV is an alphavirus, which is structurally different from the two negative strand RNA viruses FPV and VSV. Alphaviruses have a very high protein content, and the icosahedral lattices of the spike and capsid proteins are connected by strong protein-protein interactions (31Fuller S.D. Berriman J.A. Butcher S.J. Gowen B.E. Cell. 1995; 81: 715-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 32Cadd T. Skoging U. Liljeström P. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These tightly packed protein assemblies might cause the ordered structure of the membrane, sensed by the lipid probe.Table IIPolarization of DPH fluorescence in viruses or lipid vesicles at 25 °CSamplePolarizationFPV0.365VSV0.247SFV0.303ePCaEgg yolk PC.0.144DPPC0.382Fluorescence polarization of DPH (50 nm) in viruses or lipid vesicles (each 0.05 μg/ml) was measured.

Open table in a new tab Fluorescence polarization of DPH (50 nm) in viruses or lipid vesicles (each 0.05 μg/ml) was measured. Values are averaged from at least three independent experiments, and S.E. values were maximally 0.020. In vitro detergent-resistant membranes can be formed solely by lipids (16Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). However, it is not understood how proteins influence these lipid assemblies. Proteins might be required to induce or stabilize such domains in biological membranes. We used a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus, which incorporates influenza virus HA into the envelope (VSV-HA (22Kretzschmar E. Buonocore L.M.J. Schnell M.J. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5982-5989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) to analyze the detergent solubility of HA in the lipid environment of VSV. BHK cells were infected with VSV-HA, and [35S]methionine-labeled viruses were collected. The ratio of HA to VSV G in the envelope was approximately 1:5, as previously reported (Ref. 22Kretzschmar E. Buonocore L.M.J. Schnell M.J. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5982-5989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Fig. 5 A). Virions were extracted with Triton X-100 on ice and centrifuged. Proteins in the supernatant and pellet were analyzed by autoradiography or Western blotting with HA or VSV G antibodies (Fig. 5 A). Strikingly, both glycoproteins were largely solubilized by the detergent. Consistently, no significant amounts of HA were floating in density gradients after Triton X-100 extraction (Fig. 5 B, compare with Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, cholesterol in the VSV-HA envelope was efficiently solubilized in Triton X-100 (8 ± 6% insoluble), indicating that the presence of HA in a viral envelope is not sufficient to create insoluble domains and that the lipid environments incorporated into VSV and FPV during budding are different. We have analyzed detergent-resistant lipid complexes in cellular membranes and different viral envelopes. The use of the viral envelope as a model membrane has several advantages over artificial lipid vesicles. Since the envelope is derived from the cellular plasma membrane, it has a natural lipid composition. Furthermore, bilayer asymmetry is preserved. Finally, the membrane contains proteins that will have a profound influence on the membrane structure. Our results demonstrate that the three viral envelopes contain lipid raft domains to a very different extent as judged by the detergent solubility of their constituent proteins and lipids. For artificial lipid vesicles, it was demonstrated that such detergent-insoluble complexes are derived from lipids in the liquid-ordered or gel phase (15Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 17Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Several of our observations suggest that influenza viruses contain lipids in a state similar to the liquid-ordered phase. First, cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylcholine in the influenza envelope are detergent-insoluble to a large extent. Second, cholesterol is required for the insolubility of the lipids. We have previously demonstrated that cholesterol is required for detergent insolubility of HA in cells as well in the isolated virions (14Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5501-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The cholesterol dependence of SM and PC insolubility shows that cholesterol is generally required for the formation of insoluble complexes in biological membranes rather than only for a specific interaction between HA and the sterol. This is consistent with the requirement for cholesterol for the formation of ordered domains in the membrane (33Sankaram M.B. Thompson T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8686-8690Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Finally, the DPH fluorescence polarization measurements demonstrate that acyl chains in the influenza virus envelope are highly ordered, whereas acyl chains in the VSV envelope are more mobile. In lipid vesicles, detergent-resistant membranes in the gel phase can be formed independently of cholesterol, simply by the addition of high amounts of sphingolipid (15Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Instead, the lipid composition of the membranes in mammalian cells appears to be such that cholesterol is essential to promote the formation of the liquid-ordered phase, whereas a gel phase does not exist in cell membranes (34Parasassi T. Loiero M. Raimondi M. Ravagnan G. Gratton E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1153: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, it has been observed that mammalian cells can remodel their lipid acyl chains when grown under sterol-limiting conditions. Insect cells, on the other hand, remain viable when cellular cholesterol levels are reduced to 1–3% (35Silberkang M. Havel C.M. Friend D.S. McCarthy B.J. Watson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8503-8511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, cells appear capable of changing their lipid composition to allow the formation of laterally organized domains even in the absence of cholesterol as has been observed for glycosphingolipids. However, the properties of such cholesterol-poor domains have not been characterized (36Thompson T.E. Tillack T.W. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1985; 14: 361-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Viral envelopes have a very high protein:lipid ratio. It is therefore conceivable that, in addition to the lipid composition, proteins exert an influence on the membrane structure. Influenza virus HA contains in its membrane-spanning domain a determinant that is required for the association with lipid raft domains (14Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5501-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 37Lin S. Naim H. Rodriguez A.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Also, the palmitoylation of HA might contribute to the detergent insolubility, because a mutant lacking the cytoplasmic tail with the palmitoylation sites (38Naim H.Y. Amarneh B. Ktistakis N.T. Roth M.G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7585-7588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is fully soluble. 2P. Scheiffele and K. Simons, unpublished data. Both determinants interact with the lipid bilayer and might affect the order of the lipids. However, the fact that HA incorporated into the VSV envelope was mostly soluble suggests that this membrane does contain fewer lipids in an ordered phase and that the inclusion of HA is not sufficient to organize such a detergent-resistant environment. Most likely, the VSV and influenza viruses acquire membranes with different lipid composition from the plasma membrane. The cholesterol to phospholipid ratios in the envelopes of influenza viruses, VSV, and SFV appear to be similar (1Lenard J. Compans R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 344: 51-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 3Renkonen O. Kääräinen L. Simons K. Gahmberg C.G. Virology. 1971; 46: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 39Luan P. Yang L. Glaser M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9874-9883Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Since sphingolipids and saturated phospholipids are known to promote the formation of raft domains (15Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar,16Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), these lipids might be preferentially incorporated into influenza viruses. In the future, a detailed analysis of the lipid head groups and acyl chains in the different viral envelopes should clarify this issue. Such an analysis might also allow the identification of raft-promoting lipids without the use of detergents. It has recently been shown that raft domains in the plasma membrane are small and dispersed but that they can coalesce upon cross-linking of their lipid or protein constituents (8Friedrichson T. Kurzchalia T. Nature. 1998; 394: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 9Varma R. Mayor S. Nature. 1998; 394: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 40Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Similarly, large oligomeric proteins like caveolin could stabilize rafts into macroscopic domains in the liquid-ordered phase. Inversely, the size and stability of the caveolin complexes are modulated by raft domains, illustrating an interdependence of raft size and protein oligomerization (41Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Fra A.M. Virta H. Simons K. Ikonen E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Similarly, rafts could be stabilized by proteins binding to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the domains (42Lafont F. Lecat S. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1413-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We speculate that lipids in cellular membranes are kept in an equilibrium state in which specific protein interactions can modulate the dynamics of rafts, leading to coalescence or dispersion of domains in the liquid-ordered phase, depending on the oligomeric state of the protein. Coalescence of domains in the liquid-ordered phase could induce bending of the membrane (43Lipowsky R. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1133-1138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In agreement with this view, caveolae form invaginations on the cell surface but are flattened out when cholesterol is removed (44Hailstones D. Sleer L.S. Parton R.G. Stanley K.K. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 369-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, coalescence of a liquid-ordered phase might facilitate budding of influenza viruses from the plasma membrane. In this latter case, the membrane is curved outwards, whereas in the former it is curved inwards. The topology of the invagination might depend on the properties of the specific proteins involved. We have shown that lipids in the influenza virus envelope are in an ordered state and less ordered in the VSV envelope. This suggests that influenza virus is assembled from raft domains in the plasma membrane. For VSV, fluorescence digital microscopy has revealed the formation of domains during the budding step. Both the glycoprotein and the matrix protein were shown to induce lateral organization of lipid within the membrane (39Luan P. Yang L. Glaser M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9874-9883Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 45Luan P. Glaser P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4483-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Consistently, the lipid composition of the VSV envelope was shown to differ from the host cell membrane, indicating selective inclusion of specific lipid components (2Pessin J.E. Glaser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9044-9050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For influenza viruses, a detailed comparison of the lipid head groups and the acyl chains in the envelope and the host cell membrane has not been performed. The incorporation of raft domains into the viral envelope may explain some puzzling features of influenza virus assembly. It has been observed that lateral cross-linking of HA by antibodies creates large patches with raft characteristics (40Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Concomitantly, cytoplasmic proteins with raft affinity can be recruited to the raft patches without requiring direct interactions with the influenza spike protein (40Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). It has been a surprising finding that influenza viruses in which the cytoplasmic tails of both glycoproteins have been deleted still form infectious progeny (46Jin H. Leser G.P. Zhang J. Lamb R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1236-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This could be explained by connecting the influenza spike proteins over the rafts with the cytoplasmic matrix protein. Assuming that the spike proteins interact laterally with each other, this would lead to exclusion of cellular glycoproteins. A role for raft domains during virus assembly is also highlighted by the fact that the membrane-spanning domain of influenza HA is required for both its incorporation into the envelope and raft association (14Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5501-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 37Lin S. Naim H. Rodriguez A.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 47Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4831-4841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, coalescing lipid domains might be employed at sites of particle assembly to facilitate the exclusion of cellular proteins and to favor specific incorporation of the viral components.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)1 is a cytokine predominantly produced by macrophages but also by lymphocytes, NK cells, astrocytes, and other cell types. The most powerful inducers of TNF-α production by macrophages are the lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which are membrane components released by Gram-negative bacteria in the course of infection (1Beutler B. Tumor Necrosis Factors: The Molecules and Their Emerging Role in Medicine. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 485-513Google Scholar). It is now well established that the induction of TNF-α production upon stimulation of macrophages by LPS results from both an enhancement of TNF-α gene transcription and a translational derepression of the mRNA. In unstimulated macrophages, TNF-α mRNA translation is blocked. Upon stimulation with LPS, this repression is overcome, and TNF-α mRNA becomes efficiently translated (2Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The key element involved in this regulation is the AU-rich element (ARE) located in the 3′-untranslated region (-UTR) of TNF-α mRNA (3Han J. Beutler B. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1990; 1: 71-75PubMed Google Scholar). This 70-nucleotide-long sequence is composed of several repeats of the AUUUA pentamer. The physiological importance of TNF-α mRNA translational control is demonstrated by the fact that the expression of a TNF-α transgene lacking its 3′–UTR in mouse leads to severe inflammatory disorders (4Keffer J. Probert L. Cazlaris H. Georgopoulos S. Kaslaris E. Kioussis D. Kollias G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4025-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Similar AREs are found in the 3′–UTR of a growing number of mRNAs encoding cytokines, protooncogenes, or other transiently expressed proteins (5Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). These sequences have also been shown to regulate mRNA stability (6Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). In former studies, we reported that TNF-α mRNA ARE can form two complexes with proteins present in cytosolic macrophage extracts. One of these complexes (complex 1) forms with extracts of both unstimulated and LPS-stimulated macrophages and requires a large fragment of the ARE containing clustered AUUUA pentamers. The other complex (complex 2) is only detected after cell activation, binds to a minimal UUAUUUAUU nonamer, and is composed of a 55-kDa protein (7Gueydan C. Houzet L. Marchant A. Sels A. Huez G. Kruys V. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 479-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lewis T. Gueydan C. Huez G. Toulmé J.J. Kruys V. J. Biol.

To identify the proteins involved in both complexes, we designed a cloning strategy based on the differential screening of a macrophage cDNA expression library with TNF-α mRNA 3′–UTR riboprobes containing or not the ARE. By this method, we isolated the cDNA encoding the short 40-kDa isoform of the RNA-binding protein TIAR. We show that TIAR specifically binds TNF-α ARE and corresponds to the protein involved in the formation of complex 1. Moreover, analysis of TIAR subcellular localization by immunostaining reveals that TIAR is mainly found in the cytoplasm of murine macrophages.

LPS was added at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml for 2 h in all experiments. A RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cDNA library was prepared according to a previously described method (5Caput D. Beutler B.

The library or the pGEX3X-37CR plasmid-expressing AUF1 (generously provided by Dr. Gary Brewer, Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Wake Forest University, Winston Salem, North Carolina) or the pGEX5X-1-actin plasmid-expressing actin (a gift from V. Dilbeck, University of Brussels) were electroporated into MC1061 bacteria and plated to obtain 10,000 colonies/dish (dish diameter: 13.5 cm). After overnight incubation, 1 replicate/dish was performed on nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell). These “master” replicates were used to perform secondary (2 to 5) replicates. The master and the secondary replicates were then placed in dishes containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) or ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm), respectively, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The master replicates were subsequently stored at 4 °C. The secondary replicates were hung up in a sealed tube containing a 1-cm layer of pure chloroform for 35 min. Filters were then transferred into plastic bags (6 filters/bag maximum) and soaked in 300 ml of autoclaved washing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1/1000 (v/v) diethyl pyrocarbonate ) containing lysozyme (1 mg/l) and DNase I (1 mg/l) for 2 h at room temperature with light shaking. The washing buffer was then replaced by 300 ml of fresh washing buffer, and the incubation was prolonged for 4 additional h. The washing buffer was replaced for a second time, and the filters were soaked overnight. The filters were then rinsed three times for 5, 30, and 60 min, respectively, in 300 ml of binding buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 8, 4 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1/1000 (v/v) diethyl pyrocarbonate) at room temperature with light shaking. For the binding with the RNA probe, each membrane was transferred into a plastic bag containing 35 ml of binding buffer and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Heparin (0.55 mg/ml) was added, and a subsequent incubation of 10 min was performed. PolyC (10 μg/ml) was then added, and the membranes were incubated for an additional 30 min. Finally, 100 × 106 cpm of riboprobe was added per bag, and the bags were incubated overnight at room temperature with light shaking. The membranes were washed twice for 10 min in 100 ml of binding buffer at room temperature with light shaking, dried for 15 min on 3MM paper, and autoradiographed. The DNA constructs used in this study were previously described (7Gueydan C. Houzet L. Marchant A. Sels A. Huez G. Kruys V. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 479-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The riboprobes used for the screening procedure and electrophoretic shift assay (EMSA) were synthesized with the transcription kit purchased from Epicentre (Madison, WI) according to the following method. Briefly, to generate 100 × 106 cpm (approximately 1.5 ×108cpm/μg), 4 μl of SP6 transcription buffer 5×, 2 μl of 100 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μl of 10 mm ATP, 1 μl of 10 mm CTP, 1 μl of 10 mm GTP, 3 μl of 1 mm UTP, 80 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), 3 μl of linearized DNA (0.5 μg/μl), and 1 μl of SP6 RNA polymerase were mixed and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The transcription reaction was then treated with DNase for 15 min, brought to a volume of 50 μl with H2O, and extracted with phenol/chloroform. The riboprobe was then purified on a P10 minicolumn, and the volume was increased to 300 μl. The probes were stored at −70 °C. DNA sequencing was performed using the Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). S100 macrophage extracts and EMSA were carried out exactly as described previously (7Gueydan C. Houzet L. Marchant A. Sels A. Huez G. Kruys V. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 479-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Supershifts with anti-TIAR or control antibodies were performed by incubating 15 μg of S100 macrophage extract with 0.2 μg of anti-TIAR antibodies or control antibodies for 25 min on ice in a total volume of 15 μl before the EMSA. The EMSA were electrophoresed on nondenaturing 3.5% polyacrylamide gels. 150 μg of S100 extract from uninduced RAW macrophages were incubated with 4 μg of anti-TIAR antibody or control IgG in the presence of 50 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz, Ca.) for 16 h on a rotating wheel at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged for 30 s, and the supernatant was incubated with fresh antibodies and protein G beads for 24 h. After elimination of the beads by centrifugation, the protein concentration of the samples was determined by using a BCA kit (Pierce), and 15 μg of each samples were used in an EMSA as described previously. Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from RAW 264.7 cells according to the method previously described. Northern blot analysis was performed as described in Sambrook et al.(9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using 10 μg of total RNA. The blot was hybridized with a TIAR cDNA probe synthesized with the Rediprime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The same blot was subsequently hybridized with an actin probe to normalize the amount of RNA loaded on the gel. Protein extracts were prepared by recovering the cells in 0.25 m Tris, pH 7.8, and were lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. The protein concentration in the extracts was determined by the BCA protein assay (Bio-Rad). Fifteen μg of each extract were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the Western blot was performed as described elsewhere (10Nanbru C. Lafon I. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Vagner S. Huez G. Prats A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32061-32066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). TIAR protein and actin were immunodetected using anti-TIAR and anti-actin antibodies, respectively. Briefly, 105cells were centrifuged on slides, fixed with methanol for 5 min at −20 °C, and stored at room temperature until use. The slides were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated overnight with the primary antibody (anti-TIAR, anti-NF-κB, control IgG) (10 μg/ml) at 4 °C in a humidified chamber, and rinsed again in phosphate-buffered saline. Slides were subsequently incubated for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline in the presence of the secondary antibody coupled to peroxydase (20 μg/ml). Peroxydase activity was revealed by using the AEC (3-amino-9-ethyl-carbazol) method (Sigma). The slides were mounted in aquatex (Merck) and observed at 100× magnification. TNF-α ARE sequence was previously shown to form two different complexes with proteins of macrophage S100 extracts. These two complexes differ in their electrophoretic mobilities and in their recognition motifs within the ARE. Moreover, although the complex of low electrophoretic mobility (complex 1) can be detected with S100 extracts from both unstimulated and LPS-stimulated macrophages, the other complex (complex 2) is formed only upon LPS stimulation (7Gueydan C. Houzet L. Marchant A. Sels A. Huez G. Kruys V. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 479-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lewis T. Gueydan C. Huez G. Toulmé J.J. Kruys V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13781-13786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To clone the cDNAs encoding the proteins involved in these complexes, we developed an expression library screening method. We set up this method with a plasmid encoding AUF1, which has been shown to bind to AREs derived from several mRNAs (11DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). As negative control, we used a plasmid encoding actin. Bacteria expressing either AUF1 or actin were plated and replicated to perform a binding with TNF-α mRNA 3′-UTR riboprobes containing or not containing the ARE (Fig.1 and “Experimental Procedures”). Although TNF 3′-UTR riboprobe bound to the replicate of bacteria encoding AUF1, no signal could be detected with bacteria expressing actin. The binding of TNF 3′-UTR riboprobe to AUF1-expressing colonies involves the ARE, because no signal was detectable with the TNF 3′-UTRΔAU riboprobe (Fig. 2).Figure 2Validation of the screening method with AUF-1 and actin expression vectors. E. coli strain MC1061 was transformed either with AUF-1 or actin-expression vectors and plated at 10,000 colonies/dish, replicated on nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with the 3′TNF or 3′TNFΔAU RNA probes as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then screened the RAW 264.7 macrophage cDNA library in the same conditions to identify clones encoding proteins specifically binding TNF ARE. In a first step, clones detected by the binding of TNF 3′-UTR riboprobe were isolated and replated at high density. Two replicates of the resulting plates were prepared as described previously and submitted to a second differential screening with 3′TNF and 3′TNFΔAU probes. As illustrated in Fig. 3, one of the clones detected by the first screening specifically bound to 3′TNF probe in the secondary differential screening. The cDNA of five independent colonies detected with the 3′TNF probe were sequenced, and all were encoding the 40-kDa isoform of the RNA-binding protein TIAR. To determine whether TIAR is involved in one of the two complexes that can form with TNF ARE, we analyzed the binding ability of TIAR to the 3′d2 probe (Fig. 1), which has been previously shown to selectively form complex 2 and not complex 1 (Ref. 8Lewis T. Gueydan C. Huez G. Toulmé J.J. Kruys V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13781-13786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar and Fig.4 A). As illustrated in Fig.4 B, the 3′d2 riboprobe binds very weakly to TIAR-expressing colonies, indicating that TIAR might not be involved in complex 2. We next performed EMSAs with TNF 3′-UTR riboprobe and macrophage extracts in the presence of anti-TIAR or control IgG antibodies. Fig.5 A shows that the addition of anti-TIAR antibody in the EMSA markedly alters the electrophoretic mobility of complex 1 in comparison with a control IgG. On the other hand, complex 2 migration is not affected by anti-TIAR antibody, further confirming that this complex does not involve TIAR. To corroborate the involvement of TIAR in complex 1, we performed EMSAs with macrophage extract depleted of TIAR by immunoprecipitation with anti-TIAR antibody (expression library screening method). A significant decrease in complex 1 intensity was observed as compared with the level obtained when the immunodepletion was performed with a control IgG (Fig. 5 B). In parallel, we verified by Western blot analysis that immunodepletion of the extract by anti-TIAR antibody correlated with an increase of TIAR present in the immunoprecipitated protein G-Sepharose pellet (data not shown).Figure 5Identification of TIAR as a component of complex 1. A, supershift of complex (Compl.) 1 by anti-TIAR antibody.

The figure is representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) tiarhas been previously described as a widely expressed gene at least at the mRNA level. Moreover, tiargene can be expressed into two isoforms of 40 and 42 kDa (TIARb and TIARa, respectively), resulting from alternative splicing of the precursor mRNA (12Beck A.R. Medley Q.G. O'Brien S. Anderson P. Streuli M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3829-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). TIARa contains an additional 17-amino acid stretch in the first of the three RNA recognition motifs. Because of its location in a loop of the first RNA recognition motif, this 17-amino acid peptide has been suggested to be important for the protein RNA binding specificity (13Dember L.M. Kim N.D. Liu K.Q. Anderson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2783-2788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We characterized the expression of tiargene in unstimulated and LPS-stimulated macrophages at the RNA and protein levels. The Northern blot analysis of TIAR mRNA accumulation shows that TIAR mRNA is equally expressed as a 1.6-kilobase transcript in both unstimulated and LPS-stimulated RAW cells (Fig. 6 A). The resolution of the gel electrophoresis did not allow the separation of the mRNA species encoding the two isoforms. At the protein level, we observed that the 40-kDa TIARb is significantly more expressed than the 42-kDa TIARa. As at the RNA level, TIAR proteins are equally expressed in unstimulated and LPS-stimulated macrophages (Fig.6 B). TIAR, which is a protein related to TIA-1, has been initially described to trigger DNA fragmentation in permeabilized thymocytes (14Kawakami A. Tian Q. Duan X. Streuli M. Schlossman S.F. Anderson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8681-8685Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and to be localized mainly in the nucleus. However, upon Fas-mediated apoptosis, TIAR has been shown to be translocated to the cytoplasm (15Taupin J.L. Tian Q. Kedersha N. Robertson M. Anderson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1629-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Because we identified TIAR as a component of complex 1, which is formed upon incubation of TNF ARE with macrophage S100 cytosolic extracts, we determined TIAR subcellular localization in macrophages by an immunostaining analysis. This experiment showed that similarly to NF-κB, TIAR is predominantly found in the cytoplasm of RAW macrophages (Fig. 7). This cytoplasmic localization of TIAR correlates with its ability to form complex 1 from S100 cytosolic extract. It is now well established that AREs play a major role in the post-transcriptional regulation of several transiently expressed genes. These elements have been classified in two main categories according to the number and the distribution of AUUUA pentamer repeats. Class I AREs contain one to three copies of the AUUUA pentamer in a U-rich context. Prototypes of these class I AREs are found in the 3′-UTR of c-Myc and c-Fos mRNAs and confer mRNA instability. Class II AREs are defined by the presence of multiple clustered pentamers and are preferentially found in the 3′-UTR of cytokine mRNAs (16Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Depending on the systems considered, these AREs mediate mRNA instability and/or translational blockade. Several proteins have been reported to bind AREs (reviewed in Refs. 17Jarzembowski J.A. Malter J.S. Jeanteur P. Cytoplasmic Fate of Messenger RNA. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., Berlin1997: 141-172Google Scholar and 18Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, based on their molecular mass and sequence affinity, none of these factors seemed to correspond to the proteins involved in the complexes formed with TNF ARE that we previously described. The expression library screening method with RNA probes has been successfully used to clone cDNAs of proteins specifically binding to RNA through different types of RNA binding domains (19Qian Z. Wilusz J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2334-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Lee K. Fajardo M.A. Braun R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3023-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore, we developed a similar but simplified strategy based on the direct screening of bacterial colonies transformed with cDNA-expressing plasmids. This method led to the identification of TIARb as a protein specifically binding TNF ARE. Moreover, we have confirmed by supershift experiments that TIAR corresponds to the constitutive TNF ARE-binding protein present in macrophage cytosolic extract previously described as complex 1. Indeed, EMSA performed in the presence of anti-TIAR antibody markedly alters the electrophoretic mobility of complex 1. However, it should be noted that the band corresponding to complex 1 is not totally supershifted and that increasing the amount of anti-TIAR antibody does not modify the supershift ratio (data not shown). This might result from a limited affinity of anti-TIAR antibody. Alternatively, the remaining band could correspond to another complex co-migrating with complex 1. The supershift of complex 1 by anti-TIAR antibody together with the observation that complex 1 decreases upon immunodepletion of TIAR from macrophage extract indicates that this complex contains either one or both TIAR isoforms. The screening of 40,000 clones of the RAW 264.7 cDNA library led to the isolation of TIARb and not of TIARa, suggesting that TIARb is the isoform involved in complex 1. However, the predominant expression of TIARb in macrophages could also explain the preferential detection of the TIARb isoform by the screening procedure. We have shown by an immunostaining analysis that TIAR is essentially cytoplasmic in murine macrophages. This result correlates with the identification of TIAR as a protein binding TNF ARE present in S100 cytosolic extract. TIAR has been previously cloned on the basis of its homology to TIA-1, a protein mainly expressed in T lymphocytes and shown to be able to trigger DNA fragmentation in digitonin-permeabilized thymocytes (21Tian Q. Streuli M. Saito H. Schlossman S.F. Anderson P. Cell. 1991; 67: 629-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Taupin et al. (15Taupin J.L. Tian Q. Kedersha N. Robertson M. Anderson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1629-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) have also shown that TIAR is mainly located in the nucleus of human Jurkat 77 cells and relocates to the cytoplasm of these cells during Fas-mediated apoptosis. At this point, the difference observed in the localization of TIAR in human T lymphocytes and murine macrophages is not explained. TIAR localization might be cell type-dependent, or TIAR subcellular distribution could be correlated with different functional activities of this protein. However, we cannot exclude that a variation in the epitopes recognized by the antibodies used to determined TIAR localization could account for the difference observed. Indeed the monoclonal antibody used to study TIAR relocalization in FAS-activated Jurkat cells binds an epitope located in the highly conserved second RNA recognition motif of TIAR and recognized a 50-kDa polypeptide in Western blot. This 50-kDa protein is not detected in Western blot experiments performed with RAW 264.7 cell extract and an anti-TIAR antibody directed against a C-terminal peptide of TIAR ( Fig. 6 and “Experimental Procedures”). Although TIAR was known as a RNA-binding protein (13Dember L.M. Kim N.D. Liu K.Q. Anderson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2783-2788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), this study identifies the first RNA regulatory sequence recruiting TIAR. We have previously reported that a cluster of five overlapping AUUUA pentamers is the minimal sequence within TNF ARE required for complex 1 formation. We have also shown that complex 1 can form with TNF and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor class II AREs and not with c-mycclass I ARE. Therefore, TIAR being a component of complex 1 can be considered as a class II ARE-specific binding protein. TNF mRNA is both unstable and translationally regulated in macrophages (2Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 22Han J.H. Beutler B. Huez G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recently, tristetrapolin, a CCCH zinc finger protein, has been reported to mediate TNF mRNA destabilization in macrophage by interacting with TNF mRNA ARE (18Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the proteins involved in the translational control of TNF mRNA are not identified yet. As TIAR is located in the cytoplasm of macrophages and binds to TNF ARE independently of LPS treatment of the cells, it could mediate TNF translational repression. Activation of macrophages with LPS leads to the release of the translational blockade and is accompanied by the binding of a 55-kDa protein on TNF ARE, which could be responsible for this effect (8Lewis T. Gueydan C. Huez G. Toulmé J.J. Kruys V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13781-13786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The identification of the 55-kDa protein along with further characterization of TIAR function in macrophage will provide more insight into the mechanism of cytokine mRNA translational control mediated by AREs.

All three syntrophin isoforms have a PDZ domain that appears to participate in protein-protein interactions at the plasma membrane. α1-Syntrophin has additionally been shown to associate with neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) through PDZ domains in vitro. These observations suggest that α1-syntrophin may work as a modular adaptor protein that can link nNOS or other signaling enzyme to the sarcolemmal dystrophin complex. In the sarcolemma, nNOS regulates the homeostasis of reactive free radical species and may contribute to the oxidative damage to muscle protein in muscle disease such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In this study, we generated α1-syntrophin knock-out mice to clarify the interaction between α1-syntrophin and nNOS in the skeletal muscle. We observed that nNOS, normally expressed in the sarcolemma, was largely absent from the sarcolemma, but considerably remained in the cytosol of the knock-out mice. Even though the distribution of nNOS was altered, the knock-out mice displayed no gross histological changes in the skeletal muscle. We also discovered that muscle contractile properties have not been influenced in the knock-out mice. α1-Syntrophin is a member of the family of dystrophin-associated proteins and is strongly expressed in the sarcolemma and the neuromuscular junctions.

Syntrophins are intracellular peripheral membrane proteins weighing 58 kDa, originally identified in the postsynaptic membrane ofTorpedo (1Froehner S.C. Adams M.E. Peters M.F. Gee S.G. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1633-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In mammalian skeletal muscle, syntrophins co-purify with dystrophin, the protein products of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)1gene (2Butler M.H. Douville K. Murnane A.A. Kramarcy N.R. Cohen J.B.

The dystrophin complex appears to link the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix in skeletal muscle and stabilize the sarcolemma (4Campbell K.P. Kahl S.D.

Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In human and mouse, three highly conserved but distinct syntrophin isoforms, α1-, β1-, and β2-syntrophin, are encoded by different genes (7Adams M.E. Dwyer T.M. Dowler L.L. White R.A. Froehner S.C.

The β1- and β2-syntrophin transcripts are expressed in wide variety of tissues, whereas α1-syntrophin transcript is predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle (7Adams M.E. Dwyer T.M.

An immunohistochemical study using specific antibodies revealed that three syntrophins are concentrated at the neuromuscular junction, but α1-syntrophin is also present at the extrasynaptic sarcolemma (9Peters M.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar,10Peters M.F. Kramarcy N.R. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 1577-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The expression of β1-syntrophin at the sarcolemma, however, is reported to be restricted to fast twitch muscle fibers (9Peters M.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). All three syntrophins have four protein domains (7Adams M.E. Dwyer T.M. Dowler L.L. White R.A. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25859-25865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); two pleckstrin homology domains, a PDZ domain, and a carboxyl-terminal syntrophin unique domain. Pleckstrin homology domain is a small domain containing less than 100 residues and originally identified as an internally duplicated motif in pleckstrin (11Gibson T.J. Hyvonen M. Musacchio A. Saraste M. Birney E. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 349-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). It was also revealed in a number of intracellular signaling and membrane-associated cytoskeletal proteins. The 57 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of three isoforms, the syntrophin unique domain (7Adams M.E. Dwyer T.M. Dowler L.L. White R.A. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25859-25865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), are highly conserved and may serve in a specific interaction with dystrophin and its relatives, dystrobrevin (8Ahn A.H.

Finally, the PDZ domain is composed of 90 amino acids and was originally identified in postsynaptic density-95, discs large, and ZO-1 (13Ponting C.P. Phillips C. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 102-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The PDZ domain is present in diverse families of enzymes and structural proteins, all of which are concentrated at specialized cell-cell junctions, such as neuronal synapses, epithelial zona occludens, and septate junctions. These observations suggest that PDZ domain may participate in protein-protein interactions at the plasma membrane (14Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Indeed, in skeletal muscle, the association of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) and α1-syntrophin has been demonstrated using a yeast two-hybrid system (15Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. CravenS E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). α1-Syntrophin may work as a modular adaptor protein that can link a signaling enzyme and nNOS to the sarcolemmal dystrophin complex. In DMD and its experimental mouse model, mdx, which lacks dystrophin expression, nNOS is absent from the sarcolemma and partially accumulates in the cytosol (16Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Xia H. Aldape K. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). The altered regulation of nNOS in the dystrophic muscle may augment the toxicity of NO or superoxide and therefore contribute to myofiber necrosis (17Haycock J.W. MacNeil S. Jones P. Harris J.B. Mantle D. Neuroreport. 1996; 8: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); the derangement of NO metabolism is responsible for tissue damage in certain diseases (18Nathan C. Xie Q.W. J.

Reid M.B. Bredt D.S. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1994; 372: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), although the mechanism of NO action in muscle contraction is poorly understood. Galler et al. (21Galler S. Hilber K. Göbesberger A. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 434: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) showed NO-depressed muscle contraction in regard to both mechanical properties and myofibrillar ATPase activity using the skinned fibers method.

The overall magnitude of cGMP-dependent changes appears to be small (20Kobzik L. Reid M.B. Bredt D.S. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1994; 372: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of α1-syntrophin in skeletal muscle and the interaction between α1-syntrophin and nNOS in vivo, we generated α1-syntrophin knock-out mice. The deficiency of α1-syntrophin in these mice causes the decrease of nNOS expression at the sarcolemma, indicating the direct interaction of α1-syntrophin and nNOS in vivo. Very interestingly, the absence of nNOS at the sarcolemma did not result in an overt degeneration of skeletal muscle in this mutant mouse. Therefore, the absence of nNOS at the sarcolemma may not be the major causative factor of muscle degeneration in DMD or in mdx mice. In addition, the force-frequency relationship between wild-type and α1-syntrophin knock-out mice showed no significant difference in muscle contractile properties. We also examined the effects of the NOS inhibitors, 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) and nitro l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), and the exogenous NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (NP), on muscle contraction. Treatment by NOS inhibitors caused the shift of stimulation-tension curves in the mutant mice, suggesting that muscle contractile properties of α1-syntrophin knock-out mice are regulated by the nNOS activity in the cytosol. The mouse α1-syntrophin gene was isolated from a mouse genomic library prepared from 129/SvJ mice DNA (Stratagene). It was probed with a 164-base pair RT-PCR product from exon 2 (7Adams M.E. Dwyer T.M. Dowler L.L. White R.A. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25859-25865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The targeting vector, as shown in Fig. 1 a, consisted of the 6.0-kb genomic DNA containing the 1.2-kb neomycin resistance gene (BbsI site of exon 2) derived from pMC1neopoly(A) (24Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Cell. 1987; 51: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar). A 1.8-kb herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene was attached to the 5′ end of the α1-syntrophin-neomycin construction. Finally, the targeting vector was linearized using the restriction enzyme,NotI, before transfection by electroporation into E14 embryonic stem cells obtained from the inbred mouse strain 129/SvJ (23Nabeshima Y. Hanaoka K. Hayasaka M. Esumi E. Li S. Nonaka I. Nabeshima Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). After detaching the ES cells (107) from their plates using trypsin, they were suspended in 3.2 ml of cold Hanks′ solution and then mixed with the targeting vector DNA at a concentration of 25 μg/ml in an electroporation cuvette. The electroporation was carried out at 200 V and 500 microfarads using Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) apparatus. Two days following the electroporation, we added 300 μg/ml Neomycin (G418) to the cultures. On day 4 after electroporation, gancyclovir was added to the cultures to a concentration of 2 μm to isolate the cells containing a targeted disruption by positive-negative selection. Then surviving colonies were cloned after a 10-day selection period. Homologous recombinants were screened by PCR using the primers described below. The forward primer (P1), designed from neomycin resistance gene, was ATTCGCCAATGACAAGAC (24Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Cell. 1987; 51: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar), and the reverse primer (P2), outside the targeting vector, was CCTCTTTACATCTGTGTCATC. PCR was carried out for 40 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min by a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer). We generated chimeric mice using the blastocyst injection (23Nabeshima Y. Hanaoka K. Hayasaka M. Esumi E. Li S. Nonaka I. Nabeshima Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) and aggregation (25Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar) methods. Blastocysts were recovered from a mating of B6C3F1 (F1 of C57BL/6 and C3H/He) and C57BL/6 mice. ES-injected blastocysts were transplanted into uteri of pseudopregnant ICR mice. The resulting chimeric mice were mated with BALB/c mice, and homozygous mutant mice were generated by an inter-crossing of heterozygotes. The aggregation method was performed as described previously, with some modifications to suit our experimental conditions (25Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar). Chimeric mice were mated with C57BL/6 mice, and homozygous mutant mice were generated by inter-crossing of heterozygotes. We isolated genomic DNA from ES cells or mouse tails by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The genomic DNA was digested by EcoRI, fractionated using electrophoresis through 0.8% agarose gels, and transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were hybridized to the 32P-labeledNaeI-SpeI fragment of genomic DNA produced using a Random primer DNA labeling kit (Takara). Total RNA was isolated by using RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Inc.). We purified the poly(A)+RNA using the mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Poly(A)+ RNA was electrophoresed in a 1.0% denaturing agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to Hybond N+nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The hybrydization was carried out using 32P-labeled DNA probes constructed by employing a random primer DNA labeling kit (Takara). The density of the detected band were calculated using BAS-2000 (Fuji). Mouse α1-syntrophin cDNA (nucleotides 1180–1355) (26Adams M.E. Butler M.H. Dwyer T.M. Peters M.F. Murnane A.A. Froehner S.C. Neuron. 1993; 11: 531-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and mouse nNOS cDNA (nucleotides 1547–2105) (27Ogura T. Yokoyama T. Fujisawa H. Kurashima Y. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1014-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) were used to detect the mRNA of α1-syntrophin and nNOS. For RT-PCR, first strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers. The forward primer (F1) and (F2), from exon 1 of α1-syntrophin gene (7Adams M.E. Dwyer T.M. Dowler L.L. White R.A. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25859-25865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was AGCTGCCAGAAGCGCTGCTG and GCTGGGCATCAGCATCAAGG, respectively. The reverse primer (R1), from exon 3 of the α1-syntrophin gene (7Adams M.E. Dwyer T.M. Dowler L.L. White R.A. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25859-25865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was GAGGTGAGTCCCAGCCAACG. The total cellular protein was extracted from mouse hind-limb muscle for Western blot analysis. We used Bradford method and Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad) to determine the protein concentrations. The protein fractions were extracted with a reducing sample buffer (10% SDS, 70 mm Tris-HCl, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mmEDTA). 15 μg protein/lane was separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (8%). The resulting gel was subsequently transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) employing an amperage of 242 mA for 2 h. The blot was later incubated with anti-α1-syntrophin antibody. α1-Syntrophin polyclonal antibody was prepared by injecting purified synthetic peptides into rabbits according to standard protocols. Anti-α1-syntrophin antibody was raised against the peptides CRQPSSPGPQPRNLSEA (amino acids 191–206 (26Adams M.E. Butler M.H. Dwyer T.M. Peters M.F. Murnane A.A. Froehner S.C. Neuron. 1993; 11: 531-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) of α1-syntrophin plus an amino-terminal cysteine). The antibody was used at a 1:40 dilution, and its signal was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a 1:5000 dilution of the anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Tago Immunologicals). The skeletal muscle of mice were excised postmortem and then rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. 6-μm frozen sections were cut and placed on poly-l-lysine-coated slides. The slides were brought to room temperature, air dried, and acetone-fixed for 10 min. For histological analysis, the fixed sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunostaining, the sections were incubated with anti-α1-syntrophin antibody at a dilution of 1:40 and then stained using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit goat antibody (Tago Immunologicals). An NDP activity assay was performed as described previously by Kusner and Kaminski (28Kusner L.L. Kaminski H.J. Brain. Res. 1996; 730: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For this assay, 10-μm frozen sections were postfixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at 2 h. After rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline, the sections were incubated in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 37 °C. The subsequent reaction was carried out for 1 h in a dark, humidified chamber at 37 °C in 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm NADPH, and 0.16 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium. The reaction was terminated by washing with water. The extraction of nNOS was performed according to the method described by Brenman et al. (16Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Xia H. Aldape K. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). To isolate nNOS, the quadriceps muscle was homogenized in 10 volumes (w/v) of buffer A (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA). The nuclei of the muscle were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g to yield the supernatant S1. The resulting heavy microsomal pellet was resuspended in buffer B (500 mm NaCl added to buffer A), incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g, yielding supernatant S2. The pellet from this last centrifugation was resuspended in buffer B containing 0.5% Triton X-100, incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation, and centrifuged at 15,000 ×g to create supernatant S3 and the final pellet, P. The fractions were resolved using the sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6% polyacrylamide). The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), which was later incubated with anti-nNOS antibody (Transduction Laboratories). NOS catalytic assay were carried out according to the method described by Brenman et al. (16Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Xia H. Aldape K. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). The quadriceps muscle from wild-type, mdx, and homozygous mutant mice were homogenized in 10 volumes of buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm NaCl. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g to reveal the soluble fraction. The pellet was extracted in the same buffer containing 0.5m NaCl and centrifuged at 20,000 × g to create a particulate fraction. To perform the catalytic assay, aliquots from these fractions were assayed in 125-μl reactions containing 1.8 × 105 cpm of [3H]arginine (53.0 Ci/mmol), 1 mm NADPH, 640 μmCaCl2, 1 μm calmodulin, 3 μmeach of tetrahydrobiopterin, FAD, and FMN. After incubation for 25 min at 22 °C, the assays were terminated with 2 ml of 20 mmHEPES, pH 5.5, 2 mm EDTA. The samples were then applied to 1-ml columns of Dowex AG50WX-8 (Na+ form), which were eluted with 2 ml of water. [3H]citrulline was quantified by liquid scintillation spectroscopy of the 4-ml flow-through. Differences of activity of soluble or particulate fractions between wild-type and knock-out or mdx mice were calculated using Student'st test. We dissected the muscle fiber bundles from the diaphragms and extensor digitorum longus of mice and tied them at both ends with silk filaments. The bundles were then mounted in a small bath between a pair of stainless steel rods, one of which was attached to a force transducer. We then immersed the bundles in physiological salt solution containing: 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmHEPES, 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.4. Electrical stimulation was applied through a pair of platinum wires placed on both sides of the bundles. The stimulus lasted 0.5 ms and measured a voltage of 20 V. The relative force was calculated by counting the force recorded at a stimulus frequency of 125 Hz as 100%. In the experiments using bundles from diaphragm, to assess the effects of NOS inhibitor and NO donor on contraction, 1 mm 7-NI, 5 mml-NAME, or 1 μm NP was added to the physiological salt solution. We cloned and mapped the mouse α1-syntrophin gene and used that information to disrupt it in the E14 ES cell line, a line derived from the 129/SvJ mouse strain. Homologous recombination between the targeting vector and the α1-syntrophin gene resulted in the replacement of the second exon of the gene with the neomycin resistance gene, thus knocking out the α1-syntrophin gene (Fig.1 a). Five positive clones were identified from 288 G418- and GANC-resistant clones. Southern blot analysis using a probe that recognizes an 7.0-kb band in the wild-type allele and a 3.6-kb band in the targeted allele confirmed our results (Fig. 1 b). Two germline-transmitting mice from the two independently derived E14 ES cell clones were obtained and further studied. Heterozygous animals identified by Southern blot analysis were bred with each other to obtain homozygous animals. Heterozygous and homozygous mice are indistinguishable from wild-type mice and develop normally in nearly all respects. Our Northern blot analysis revealed the expression of α1-syntrophin mRNA in the skeletal muscle of wild-type mice through strong signals at 2.2 and 2.6 kb (Fig.2 a). This result is consistent with a previous report regarding α1-syntrophin expression (7Adams M.E. Dwyer T.M. Dowler L.L. White R.A. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25859-25865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The size of α1-syntrophin mRNA of heterozygous mutant mice was identical to that of wild-type mice, but the amount of α1-syntrophin mRNA was about 70% of that in wild-type mice. The mRNA of homozygous mutant mice included a 1.9-kb band and light smears in the vicinity of 1.5 kb. The amounts were 20% that of wild-type mice. Our RT-PCR analysis of the skeletal muscle mRNA of wild-type and homozygous mutant mice employed pairs of primers that spanned exon 1 and 3 of the α1-syntrophin gene. Wild-type mice revealed a PCR product with an expected size, but homozygous mutant mice had a shorter than expected product (Fig. 2 c). We cloned the PCR product from homozygous mutant mice and found that the entire exon 2 of the α1-syntrophin gene was missing. To investigate the expression of α1-syntrophin at the protein level, we prepared an anti-α1-syntrophin antibody. The polyclonal antibody was raised against synthetic peptide corresponding to α1-syntrophin (amino acids 191–206). Using this antibody, we carried out Western blot analysis of the skeletal muscle lysates of wild-type, heterozygous mutant, and homozygous mutant mice (Fig. 2 d). Wild-type mice revealed a 59-kDa band that corresponds to α1-syntrophin, whereas homozygous mutant mice showed no detectable α1-syntrophin. In addition, we could not detect any truncated fragments that could have been derived from the exon 2-lacking transcript. Heterozygous mutant mice produced nearly half the amount of α1-syntrophin compared with wild-type mice. We examined frozen sections of the tibialis anterior and soleus muscles of wild-type and homozygous mutant mice using hematoxylin and eosin staining (Fig.3, a–d). There were no striking morphologic changes in these skeletal muscles. We could detect neither degeneration and regeneration of muscle fibers nor cellular infiltrations and proliferation of connective tissues in the α1-syntrophin knock-out mice. Histochemical analysis using Myosin-ATPase staining indicated that the differentiation of muscle fiber types has not been affected. Using anti-α1-syntrophin antibody, we examined adult skeletal muscle immunohistochemically (Fig. 3, e and f). In wild-type mice, the expression of α1-syntrophin was detected at the sarcolemma and was particularly enriched at the neuromuscular junction, as already reported (10Peters M.F. Kramarcy N.R. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 1577-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In homozygous mutant mice, the expression of α1-syntrophin was completely absent in both the sarcolemma and the neuromuscular junction. The labeling pattern for the α1-syntrophin of heterozygous mutant mice was indistinguishable from that of wild-type mice. To investigate the expression of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex in α1-syntrophin knock-out mice, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of adult skeletal muscles using anti-dystrophin and anti-α-sarcoglycan antibody. The expression of dystrophin and α-sarcoglycan appeared to be not altered in homozygous mutant skeletal muscle (data not shown). Recent research has suggested that α1-syntrophin anchors nNOS to the sarcolemma (14Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). We investigated the influence of the loss of α1-syntrophin on the expression of nNOS in the homozygous mutant muscle. We did this by performing a Northern blot analysis of adult skeletal muscle (Fig. 4 a). In wild-type mice, a single 10-kb band corresponding to nNOS mRNA was detected. Homozygous mutant mice produced an equal amount of nNOS mRNA. In mdx skeletal muscle, the amount of nNOS mRNA was decreased to 50% in accord with the previous report (29Chang W.J. Iannaccone S.T. Lau K.S. Masters B.S.S. McCabe T.J. McMillan K. Padre R.C. Spencer M.J. Tidball J.G. Stull J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9142-9147Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In DMD and mdx mice, nNOS is absent from the sarcolemma but expressed in the cytosol although in small amounts. Like nNOS, NDP activity in skeletal muscle fibers is also concentrated in the sarcolemma and colocalizes with nNOS (28Kusner L.L. Kaminski H.J. Brain. Res. 1996; 730: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 c). In α1-syntrophin knock-out mice, however, NDP activity was completely absent in the sarcolemma (Fig. 4 d). We also investigated the subcellular distribution of nNOS in the quadriceps muscle of α1-syntrophin knock-out mice (Fig. 4,e and f). In wild-type mice, significant amounts of nNOS remained in the insoluble pellet (P) even after the sequential S1, S2, and S3 extractions of skeletal muscle homogenates. By contrast, nNOS was largely removed with 100 mm NaCl (S1) and did not remain in the pellet (P) fraction in α1-syntrophin knock-out mice. Our study of nNOS catalytic activity demonstrated that this activity for nNOS was strongest in the particulate fractions of skeletal muscle homogenates in wild-type mice in accord with previous report (15Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. CravenS E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar) (Table I). In mdx mice, some nNOS activity remained in the soluble fractions, whereas activity in the particulate fractions was decreased. Homozygous mutant has decreased nNOS activity in the particulate fraction but maintained the activity in the soluble fractions, compared with wild-type mice. In addition, the total nNOS activity for homozygous mutant mice was 59% that of wild-type mice; the activity for mdx mice was only 27% when calculated using the mean value.Table INOS catalytic assayFractionSolubleSignificanceParticulateSignificance+/+3.77 ± 0.447.60 ± 1.34−/−4.42 ± 1.35NS2.28 ± 0.82p < 0.02mdx2.33 ± 0.58NS0.74 ± 0.40p < 0.005nNOS catalytic activity was enriched in the particulate fractions of skeletal muscle homogenates in wild-type mice.

The values are the means ± S.E. (n = 4 in all comparisons; ×105 cpm mg−1 protein). NS, not significant. To examine the influence of intracellular distribution of nNOS in knock-out mice on muscle contraction, we measured contractile properties of the diaphragm and the extensor digitorum longus muscles (Fig. 5). We first measured the relative forces exerted during submaximal contractions to determine the steady state force-frequency relationship in the diaphragm of the wild-type and α1-syntrophin knock-out mice. No significant difference was observed between wild-type and α1-syntrophin knock-out mice at any stimulus frequency measured. Extensor digitorum longus muscle was also investigated but again did not produce any differences between wild-type and knock-out mice (data not shown). In diaphragm, we further investigated the influence of NOS inhibitors and NO donor on muscle contractions (Fig. 5). Exposure to the NOS inhibitor 7-NI shifted the force-frequency relationship up and to the left at both wild-type and α1-syntrophin knock-out mice, and the relative forces showed no significant difference between the mice. Exposure to the NOS inhibitor, l-NAME also shifted the force-frequency relationship up and to the left at both wild-type and α1-syntrophin knock-out mice. However, l-NAME had a relatively weak effect on contraction in knock-out mice compared with the effect in wild-type mice. Treatment by the NO donor NP did not result in any significant changes from the steady state. Our α1-syntrophin knock-out mice produce a truncated transcript that lacks 186 base pairs of exon 2 of the α1-syntrophin gene. This missing segment could cause an in-frame deletion and produce a truncated α1-syntrophin lacking the PDZ domain. However, Western blot analysis detected no truncated α1-syntrophin in the knock-out mice. We conclude that a truncated α1-syntrophin probably is unstable and therefore difficult to detect, although small amount of truncated α1-syntrophin mRNA is identified. In α1-syntrophin knock-out mice, there is no NDP activity in the sarcolemma and a considerable amount of nNOS remains at the soluble fraction. The interaction of α1-syntrophin and nNOS has been demonstrated in vitro by using the yeast two-hybrid system, pull-down assay, and protein overlay assay (15Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. CravenS E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). Although there is an altered distribution of nNOS in DMD and mdx mice, it is not known which protein among the dystrophin-associated proteins is responsible for the disappearance of nNOS from the sarcolemma. Our data strongly suggest that α1-syntrophin interacts with nNOS in vivo via the PDZ domain and anchors nNOS to the submembranous dystrophin complex. The role of NO in skeletal muscle is not clear. Altering the regulation of nNOS in dystrophic muscle can augment the toxic interaction of NO and superoxide with the cell and contribute to myofiber necrosis (17Haycock J.W. MacNeil S. Jones P. Harris J.B. Mantle D. Neuroreport. 1996; 8: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In DMD and mdx mice, the preferential degeneration of fast twitch fiber can be explained by the selective enrichment of nNOS in fast twitch muscle fibers (20Kobzik L. Reid M.B. Bredt D.S. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1994; 372: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Our knock-out mice have no obvious degeneration of their muscle fibers despite the disappearance of α1-syntrophin and nNOS from the sarcolemma. This suggests that the degeneration process does not arise merely from the altered distribution of nNOS. NO produced by nNOS near the sarcolemma of fast twitch muscle fibers appears to regulate the muscle contraction by opposing the generation of contractile force (20Kobzik L. Reid M.B. Bredt D.S. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1994; 372: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Our functional analysis of the contractile properties of wild-type and α1-syntrophin knock-out mice revealed no significant changes when tested at steady state. This observation shows that the muscles of the knock-out mice still retain enough NO to regulate muscle contraction by depressing the contractile force. This was also supported by the findings that treatment with a NOS inhibitor, 7-NI, shifted the force-frequency relationship to the left not only in wild-type mice but also in α1-syntrophin knock-out mice. However, another NOS inhibitor, l-NAME, had a comparatively weak effect on muscle contraction of α1-syntrophin knock-out mice than the effect on that of wild-type mice. We cannot exclude the possibility that the modest response to l-NAME reflects reduced expression of nNOS and/or the altered distribution of nNOS in α1-syntrophin knock-out mice. Although Kobzik et al. (20Kobzik L. Reid M.B. Bredt D.S. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1994; 372: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) showed that the exogenous NO donor, sodium nitroprusside, could depress the development of tension, our findings reveal that sodium nitroprusside has no significant effect on contraction. Because the effect of the exogenous NO donor was relatively modest compared with the NOS inhibitor in the previous study, the exogenous NO donor might have a weak effect on contraction in our particular assay. The biochemical nNOS catalytic activity assay showed that α1-syntrophin knock-out mice maintained 59% of nNOS activity compared with wild-type mice and that certain activities were still retained at the cytosol fraction. We believe that the remaining nNOS activity in the cytosol regulates the contractile properties of α1-syntrophin knock-out mice. Although the target of NO in skeletal muscle contraction has not yet been assigned to either myofibrillar proteins, the Ca2+release channel, or any other factors, our results suggest that cytosolic nNOS could compensate for the lost activity of membrane-associated nNOS and provide enough NO to depress the excessive contraction. α1-Syntrophin transcript is also expressed in tissues other than skeletal and cardiac muscles. The amount of mRNA in tissues other than striated muscle is very low, and its expression in other tissues has not yet been fully verified and therefore must be investigated. Although we have demonstrated an important role for α1-syntrophin in the function of nNOS within the sarcolemma, further study will be needed to gain a deeper understanding of the function of α1-syntrophin in the contraction and maintenance of the structure of skeletal muscle.

https://openalex.org/W2103789511,"Lipid-free apolipoprotein (apo) A-I contributes to the reverse transport of cholesterol from the periphery to the liver by solubilizing plasma membrane phospholipid and cholesterol. The features of the apolipoprotein required for this process are not understood and are addressed in the current study. Membrane microsolubilization of human fibroblasts is not specific for apo A-I; unlipidated apos A-II, C, and E incubated with the fibroblast monolayers at a saturating concentration of 50 μg/ml are all able to release cholesterol and phospholipid similarly. To determine the properties of the apolipoprotein that drive the process, apo A-I peptides spanning the entire sequence of the protein were utilized; the peptides correspond to the 11- and 22-residue amphipathic α-helical segments, as well as adjacent combinations of the helices. Of the 20 helical peptides examined, only peptides representing the N-and C-terminal portions of the protein had the ability to solubilize phospholipid and cholesterol. Cholesterol efflux to the most effective peptides, 44–65 and 209–241, was approximately 50 and 70%, respectively, of that to intact apo A-I. Deletion mutants of apo E and apo A-I were constructed that have reduced lipid binding affinities as compared with the intact molecule. The proteins, apo A-I (Δ222–243), apo A-I (Δ190–243), apo E3 (Δ192–299) and apo E4 (Δ192–299) all exhibited a decreased ability to remove cellular cholesterol and phospholipid. These decreases correlated with the reduced ability of these proteins to penetrate into a phospholipid monomolecular film. Overall, the results indicate that insertion of amphipathic α-helices between the plasma membrane phospholipid molecules is a required step in the mechanism of apolipoprotein-mediated cellular lipid efflux. Therefore the lipid binding ability of the apolipoprotein is critical for efficient membrane microsolubilization. Lipid-free apolipoprotein (apo) A-I contributes to the reverse transport of cholesterol from the periphery to the liver by solubilizing plasma membrane phospholipid and cholesterol. The features of the apolipoprotein required for this process are not understood and are addressed in the current study. Membrane microsolubilization of human fibroblasts is not specific for apo A-I; unlipidated apos A-II, C, and E incubated with the fibroblast monolayers at a saturating concentration of 50 μg/ml are all able to release cholesterol and phospholipid similarly. To determine the properties of the apolipoprotein that drive the process, apo A-I peptides spanning the entire sequence of the protein were utilized; the peptides correspond to the 11- and 22-residue amphipathic α-helical segments, as well as adjacent combinations of the helices. Of the 20 helical peptides examined, only peptides representing the N-and C-terminal portions of the protein had the ability to solubilize phospholipid and cholesterol. Cholesterol efflux to the most effective peptides, 44–65 and 209–241, was approximately 50 and 70%, respectively, of that to intact apo A-I.

High density lipoprotein (HDL)1 and its major protein component, apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, have been established to be anti-atherogenic in nature (1Gordon D.J. Rifkind B.M. N. Engl. J.

This is presumably due to their central role in mediating the transport of cholesterol from peripheral cells to locations of catabolism, a process termed reverse cholesterol transport (3Glomset J.A.

It is well established that the initial efflux of unesterified (free) cholesterol (FC) to HDL in this process occurs by one of two distinct mechanisms (6Oram J.F. Yokoyama S. J.

Rothblat G.H. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 137: S13-S17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). When apo A-I is present as a structural component of fully lipidated HDL particles, cellular FC is incorporated by the well defined aqueous diffusion mechanism (10Phillips M.C. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 223-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Alternatively, under conditions that cause the apolipoprotein to dissociate from HDL, creating a pool of lipid-free (poor) apo A-I, cellular FC associates with the apolipoprotein by a membrane microsolubilization mechanism. In this process, apo A-I associates with the plasma membrane and stimulates FC efflux by simultaneously solubilizing the cellular FC and phospholipid (PL) (9Phillips M.C. Gillotte K.L. Haynes M.P.

The details of this mechanism are not well understood at this point; the current paper focuses on understanding the structural characteristics of apo A-I that drive this process.The exchangeable apolipoproteins of HDL (apo A-I, apo A-II, apo A-IV, apo C, apo E) are all able to access cellular FC and PL (6Oram J.F.

Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1699-1709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that FC efflux mediated by lipid-free apolipoproteins is dependent on a shared structural motif. In fact, each of these apolipoproteins contains several α-helical segments that are amphipathic in nature; these domains provide the apolipoprotein molecules with the ability to associate with lipids and act as structural components of HDL (16Segrest J.P.

Studies investigating lipid-free apolipoprotein-mediated FC efflux have focused on apo A-I as an acceptor, as this component of HDL readily dissociates from the fully lipidated particle to a lipid-free (poor) form (18Barrans A.

The lipid affinities of the amphipathic α-helices of apo A-I are likely to be significant for the apo A-I-mediated solubilization of plasma membrane PL and FC, although this issue has not been examined in detail.Several groups have reported that the C-terminal domain of the apo A-I molecule is particularly important for the lipid-associating properties of the protein (22Minnich A.

A. 1996; 93: 13605-13610Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, recent studies of amphipathic peptides representing the α-helical domains of apo A-I have indicated that the first and last helices of the intact protein have the greatest lipid affinities (26Palgunachari M.N. Mishra V.K. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Adeyeye S.O. Alluri S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In the current work, we address the importance of these regions in apo A-I-mediated membrane microsolubilization through the use of synthetic apo A-I peptides. The proposed structural organization of residues 44–243 includes eight 22-mer and two 11-mer amphipathic helical domains. The abilities of peptides that represent these helical domains alone as well as in combination to solubilize FC and PL from FC-enriched human fibroblast cells were investigated; the peptides systematically address the entire apo A-I sequence. To further investigate the role of domains of high lipid binding affinity in FC efflux, apo A-I deletion mutants were constructed. Apo A-I molecules lacking residues 190–243 (Δ190–243) and apo A-I lacking residues 222–243 (Δ222–243) bind PL less well than wild-type apo A-I. The C-terminal domain of human apo E is also responsible for its lipid binding (27Westerlund J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15745-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A.

To check whether any correlation between lipid binding affinity and ability to remove cellular lipids is peculiar to apo A-I, apo E variants lacking the lipid binding domain were also utilized. Apo E3 and apo E4 lacking residues 192–299 (Δ192–299) display reduced association with lipids as compared with intact apo E3 and apo E4 molecules (29Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results of experiments with synthetic peptides and engineered apo A-I and apo E molecules demonstrate that there is a correlation between the lipid binding affinities of apolipoproteins and their abilities to participate in membrane microsolubilization of cellular PL and FC. The mechanism of apolipoprotein-mediated lipid efflux requires the presence of amphipathic α-helical segments that can penetrate into the plasma membrane and induce the solubilization of lipids.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsChloramphenicol, cholesterol, cholesteryl methyl ether, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, lysozyme, and yeast growth media were purchased from Sigma.

Minimal essential medium and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were purchased from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Bovine calf and fetal serum were supplied by Life Technologies, Inc. All media were supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Sigma). Anti-human apo A-I (rabbit) polyclonal antibody was purchased from Accurate (Westbury, NY) and the anti-rabbit IgG (goat), alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibody was from Pierce. All other reagents were analytical grade. FPLC columns and supplies were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.MethodsPreparation of LipoproteinsHDL and low density lipoprotein were isolated from fresh plasma obtained from normolipidemic donors by sequential ultracentrifugation as described previously (30Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1562-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and each appeared as a single band on agarose gel electrophoresis. Prior to use the isolated lipoproteins were dialyzed extensively against Tris buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mmEDTA; pH 8.2).Purification of Apo A-I and Apo A-IIHuman HDL was delipidated in ethanol/diethyl ether (31Scanu A.M. Edelstein C. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and apo A-I and apo A-II were isolated by anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose (32Weisweiler P. Friedl C. Ungar M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1987; 169: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The proteins were stored in lyophilized form at −70 °C. Prior to use, the purified apolipoprotein was resolubilized in 6 mguanidine HCl and dialyzed extensively against the Tris buffer mentioned above. Concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm (ε = 1.23 and 0.87 ml/mg·cm for apo A-I and apo A-II, respectively) or by a modification of the Lowry method (33Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5290) Google Scholar).Purification of Apo C and Apo E4Human very low density lipoprotein isolated from the fresh plasma of normolipidemic subjects was delipidated in chloroform:methanol, and the total apo C fraction (a mixture of apo CI, CII, CIII1, and CIII2) was isolated by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 followed by anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose (34Rall S.J. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Apo E4 was isolated in a similar fashion from very low density lipoprotein obtained by plasmaphoresis of an individual with hyperlipidemia and phenotyped as apo E4/4; the very low density lipoprotein was kindly provided by Dr. Daniel Rader (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). Prior to use the purified apolipoproteins were resolubilized in 6 mguanidine HCl and dialyzed extensively against the above Tris buffer. Concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm (ε = 1.4 and 1.31 ml/mg·cm for total apo C and apo E4, respectively). Recombinant apo E3, apo E3 Δ192–299, and apo E4 Δ192–299 samples expressed inE. coli were prepared as described previously (35Dong L.M. Parkin S. Trakhanov S.D. Rupp B. Simmons T. Arnold K.S.

Biol. 1996; 3: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Preparation of Apo A-I PeptidesPure peptides representing segments of apo A-I were synthesized using an automated solid phase peptide synthesizer as described previously (26Palgunachari M.N. Mishra V.K. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Adeyeye S.O. Alluri S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

To promote the α-helical stability of the peptide molecules, the N and C termini were acetylated and amidated (except for peptide 1–33), respectively (38Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Phillips M.C. Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Tytler E.M. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Proteins. 1993; 15: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Peptide solutions were prepared by weighing known amounts of the peptides into tubes and solubilizing them in Tris buffer, assuming that 90% of the dry weight was pure peptide (determined by dissolving known weights of the lyophilized peptides and measuring either the absorbance at 280 nm for peptides containing Tyr and/or Trp or the concentration by quantitative amino acid analysis).Expression and Purification of apo A-I Deletion Mutant ProteinsConstruction of the cDNA for apo A-I (Δ222–243) and apo A-I (Δ190–243) was carried out by Holvoet et al.(23Holvoet P. Zhao Z. Vanloo B. Vos R. Deridder E. Dhoest A. Taveirne J. Brouwers E. Demarsin E. Engelborghs Y. Rosseneu M. Collen D. Brasseur R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13334-13342Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) as formerly described. Wild-type apo A-I and the apo A-I mutants were expressed in the periplasmic space of Escherichia coliWK6 host cells (23Holvoet P. Zhao Z. Vanloo B. Vos R. Deridder E. Dhoest A. Taveirne J. Brouwers E. Demarsin E. Engelborghs Y. Rosseneu M. Collen D. Brasseur R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13334-13342Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown in 2YT medium at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.5. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and the induction was carried out for 2.5 h at 37 °C. The cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min; periplasmic cell fractions were prepared from the pellet as described previously (39Koshland D. Botstein D. Cell. 1980; 20: 749-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).The apo A-I mutants were purified from the bacterial proteins through hydrophobic and ion exchange chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose columns using a FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified proteins were confirmed as apo A-I variants through Western blot analysis utilizing a polyclonal rabbit anti-human apo A-I antibody (Accurate) and secondary antibody with a specific conjugate for alkaline phosphatase (Pierce). The concentration of the purified proteins was determined by their absorbance at 280 nm after calculating the extinction coefficient for each of the apo A-I variants (ε = 1.28 and 1.41 ml/mg·cm for apo A-I (Δ222–243) and apo A-I (Δ190–243), respectively).Determination of the Lipid Binding Affinities of Apolipoproteins and Apo A-I PeptidesThe relative affinities of the proteins for a lipid-water interface were determined as described in detail previously (26Palgunachari M.N. Mishra V.K. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Adeyeye S.O. Alluri S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The procedure utilizes a surface balance technique to measure the surface pressure at which the proteins are no longer able to penetrate an egg PC monolayer. Egg PC was spread at the air-water interface in a Teflon dish containing 80 ml of PBS to provide an initial surface pressure (πi) ranging from 5 to 35 dyn/cm. Apo A-I, apo E, or apo A-I peptides in buffer containing 1.5m guanidine HCl were injected into the subphase at an initial concentration of 50 μg/dl, which was diluted by the PBS to result in a final guanidine HCl concentration of ≤1 mmol/liter. The change in surface pressure (Δπi) was recorded by a mica plate connected to a Cahn RTL recording electrobalance until a steady state was achieved; the solution was stirred continuously with a magnetic stirrer throughout the measurement. The equilibrium Δπi values were plotted as a function of π and linear extrapolation to the point at which Δπi = 0 dyn/cm provided the monolayer exclusion pressure (πe).Association of the peptides with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) multilamellar vesicles was performed as described in detail previously (26Palgunachari M.N. Mishra V.K. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Adeyeye S.O. Alluri S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptides were mixed with multilamellar vesicles at a 1:1 (w:w) ratio. The ability of the peptide to solubilize the DMPC and clarify the turbid solution was determined by the scattered light intensity measured at 400 nm on a SLM 8100 photon-counting spectrofluorometer.Preparation of Cell MonolayersNormal human skin GM3468A fibroblasts (passages < 30) were plated in 22-mm, 12-well plates and grown to confluence in minimal essential medium (MEM)/bicarbonate supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a 37 °C humidified incubator (95% air, 5% CO2). Upon reaching confluence, the cells were labeled with either 10–20 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol diluted in MEM supplemented with 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum (40Bielicki J.K. Johnson W.J. Glick J.M. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or 15 μCi/ml [3H]choline chloride diluted in MEM with 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum for 48–72 h. In these preparations, radioactivity present in ethanol was dried under nitrogen and resolubilized in 50 μl ethanol before adding the media to ensure that the ethanol concentration was always less than 1% (v/v). For experiments utilizing unesterified cholesterol (FC)-enriched monolayers, the radiolabeled fibroblast monolayers were incubated an additional 24 h with a FC-loading medium (15Bielicki J.K. Johnson W.J. Weinberg R.B. Glick J.M. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1699-1709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This medium contained 2 μg/ml Sandoz compound 58035 to inhibit FC esterification (41Ross A.C. Go K.J. Heider J.G. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 815-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 100 μg of FC/ml of FC:PL dispersions (>2:1, mol:mol) (42McCloskey H.M. Rothblat G.H. Glick J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 320-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), 50 μg of protein/ml of human low density lipoprotein, 2 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and either 20 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol or 20 μCi/ml [3H]choline chloride. The [3H]choline label was used to follow the movement of PL as it has been shown previously that 90% of the PL released from cholesterol-enriched fibroblasts to lipid-free apo A-I is choline-containing (15Bielicki J.K. Johnson W.J. Weinberg R.B. Glick J.M. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1699-1709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The above procedure results in a 2–3-fold increase in cellular FC.Efflux of Cellular Cholesterol(43). After washing the cell monolayers with 1 ml of MEM-HEPES (four times), FC efflux measurements were initiated by the application of 1.0 ml/well of the test medium, consisting of acceptor diluted to the desired protein concentration in MEM-HEPES. The experiments were conducted in a covered 37 °C water bath, and all media were supplemented with HEPES. The radioactivity in an aliquot of the medium was determined by liquid scintillation counting at specific time intervals to estimate the fraction of FC released into the medium; any cellular material was removed prior to counting by filtration of the medium through a 0.45 μm filter. Upon completion of the time course, all cell wells were washed with PBS (BioWhittaker) three times, and the cellular lipids were extracted with isopropanol (44Johnson W.J. Bamberger M.J. Latta R.A. Rapp P.E. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5766-5776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From the extracted lipids, the total amount of radioactive FC per well was measured by liquid scintillation counting, and FC mass was also assayed. Total cellular FC present in the monolayers at zero time was typically 40–60 μg/mg cell protein.Efflux of Cellular PhospholipidAfter washing the monolayers with MEM-HEPES (three times), PL efflux measurements were initiated as described for FC efflux. An aliquot of the medium was removed at specific time intervals and filtered through a 0.45 μm filter; 10 μg of butylated hydroxytoluene was then added to prevent the oxidation of PL. The lipids were extracted from the sample by treatment with 1:1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol (45Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42174) Google Scholar), and then the aqueous phase was aspirated, and the chloroform phase was washed three times with 10/9 (v/v) methanol/water. The chloroform phase was dried under nitrogen in liquid scintillation vials and radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Upon completion of the time course, all cell wells were washed with PBS three times, and the cellular lipids were extracted with isopropanol containing 10 μg of butylated hydroxytoluene/ml. The extracts were dried under nitrogen, and the free [3H]choline was removed as described above. From the extraction, the total amount of radioactive, choline-containing PL per well was determined. The mass of choline-containing PL was determined by an enzymatic assay (Wako). Total cellular choline-containing PL present in the monolayers at zero time was typically 120–140 μg/mg cell protein.Data AnalysisThe fractional release of FC or PL was determined experimentally and analyzed as described previously for this system (43Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22975-22982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic analysis was based on the assumptions that the system is closed and that all lipid therefore exists in either the cellular lipid pool or the acceptor pool. The cellular cholesterol pool exists primarily in the FC state as cholesterol esterification is negligible in the human fibroblast cells and compound 58035, an acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase inhibitor, was included in all manipulations. The equilibration of FC or PL between the lipid and acceptor pools was fitted to the mono-exponential rate equation Y = Ae −Bt +E, where Y represents the fraction of radiolabeled lipid remaining in the cells, t is the incubation time, A is a pre-exponential term that reflects the fraction of lipid that exists in the medium at equilibrium,B is a time constant characteristic of the release of FC or PL, and E is a constant that represents the fraction of labeled lipid that remains associated with the cells at equilibrium. These variables were derived by fitting the experimental data to the equation by nonlinear regression (GraphPad Prism, GraphPad Software Inc.). The apparent rate constant for efflux (k e) was derived from these parameters. The half-time of efflux value in hours was then calculated as follows: t 12 = ln2/k e. The computed half time values were statistically compared by Student's t test (GraphPad Prism).RESULTSIt is well established that apo A-I, as well as the other HDL apolipoproteins, has the ability to solubilize FC and PL from the plasma membrane of cells (6Oram J.F. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2473-2491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the requirements of the FC acceptor protein in the membrane microsolubilization process, the abilities of lipid-free apo A-I, apo A-II, apo C, apo E3, and apo E4 to remove cellular lipids were compared. These HDL proteins are all composed of several amphipathic α-helical segments, and they range in molecular mass from approximately 6 to 34 kDa. The unlipidated apolipoproteins were incubated at 50 μg/ml, a concentration well above that which is required for saturable FC or PL efflux (15Bielicki J.K. Johnson W.J. Weinberg R.B. Glick J.M. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1699-1709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with FC-enriched human fibroblasts. From the 8-h time course displayed in Fig. 1, it is clear that except for apo A-II, the apolipoproteins all have similar abilities to stimulate FC efflux. Apo A-II removes approximately 2% of the cellular FC in 8 h, whereas the other apolipoproteins solubilize 4.5–5%. These results are not explained by variations in the initial rate at which FC is obtained by the different proteins because the k e, or efflux rate constant, determined from the first 1 h of the time course was 1.1 ± 0.1, 1.2 ± 0.1, 1.1 ± 0.2, 0.9 ± 0.1 and 0.9 ± 0.1%/h for apo A-I, apo A-II, apo C, apo E3, and apo E4, respectively. The apparent inefficiency of apo A-II in the membrane microsolubilization process was not observed when the PL efflux was determined, as shown in Fig.2. In this case, all of the apolipoproteins initiated at least as much choline-containing PL efflux as apo A-I, and apo C removed significantly more."

A naturally occurring variant of caspase-9 named caspase-9S was cloned from human liver. Caspase-9S is missing most of the large subunit of caspase-9, including the catalytic site, but has the intact prodomain and small subunit. Caspase-9S did not show apoptotic activity in transfection analysis. Overexpression of caspase-9S inhibited apoptosis induced by caspase-9, indicating that caspase-9S is an endogenous dominant-negative of caspase-9. Moreover, caspase-9S inhibited apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-α, TNF factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), Bax, or Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD) as well as the combination of Apaf-1 and caspase-9. In vitrobinding assays demonstrated that caspase-9S binds to Apaf-1 and blocks the binding of caspase-9 to Apaf-1. Coexpression of caspase-9 and caspase-9S mRNA was identified in various cell lines. Thus, caspase-9S acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of caspase-9 activation, at least in part, by blocking Apaf-1-caspase-9 interaction.

Transmembrane receptor molecules including TNF1-R1, Fas, and TRAIL-R are known to activate apoptotic signaling pathways following ligand binding.

This signaling event is followed by activation of caspase cascades leading to cleavage of cytosolic, cytoskeletal, as well as nuclear proteins and DNA. Although TRAIL-R is also known to induce cellular events similar to those activated by TNF-α and Fas, the molecular signaling events for this receptor are only partially characterized (11Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). Most evidence implicates the activation of caspases as an essential step in apoptotic signaling (1Nagata S.

Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). All caspases, so far identified, are initially synthesized as inactive zymogens composed of the prodomain plus large and small subunits. Generation of the active caspase requires sequence-specific proteolytic cleavage to convert the zymogen to a corresponding active enzyme (1Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar, 2Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that caspase-3 is pivotal in the execution of apoptosis (12Kuida K. Zheng T.S.

Miyajima A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23111-23116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recently, caspase-3 was shown to liberate a DNase termed CAD (caspase-activated DNase) from an inhibitor of CAD (ICAD) by cleaving the ICAD protein (14Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar, 15Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S.

Although many inducers of apoptosis lead to activation of caspase-3 activation and other terminal caspases, the pathways leading to this event are not well established. It is likely that numerous mechanisms exist to limit the activation of caspase-3 and other terminal caspases. For example, nitric oxide blocks caspase-3 (and potentially other caspases) activation and activity by modifying cysteine residue of the catalytic site (17Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 18Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol.

The anti-apoptotic p35 protein is enzymatically processed and forms a stable caspase-p35 complex, preventing autoproteolytic activation of caspases (21Bump N.J. Hackett M. Hugunin M. Seshagiri S.

A mechanism for the activation of caspase-3 involving the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria has been identified (22Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). TNF-α, Fas ligand (or agonistic Fas antibody), and TRAIL are known to induce the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria during apoptosis (23Reed J.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that Bcl-2 family member Bid links receptor-mediated apoptotic signals to cytochrome c release from mitochondria (24Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar, 25Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar). The C-terminal portion of Bid generated by caspase-8 activated through Fas signaling pathway targets mitochondria and induces cytochromec release (24Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar). However, the detailed biochemical mechanism by which cleaved Bid induces cytochrome c release from mitochondria remains to be resolved. Once released, cytochromec is now known to bind to Apaf-1, a mammalian homologue ofC. elegans Ced-4, inducing a conformational change of Apaf-1 (22Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Apaf-1 associated with cytochrome c and dATP directly activates procaspase-9 (22Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar) by interacting with the prodomain, termed CARD (caspase recruitment domain) of procaspase-9 (22Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar, 26Pan G. O'Rourke K. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5841-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Thus, caspase-9 is positioned at the apex in the apoptotic signaling cascades activated by released cytochromec. The activated caspase-9 then is able to activate procaspase-3 (22Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that caspase-9 may be a central regulator of caspase-3 in a cytochromec-dependent signaling pathway involving Apaf-1. Thus, caspase-9 activation is a potential key site for the regulation of apoptosis. This hypothesis is supported not only by results obtained with caspase-9 knockout mice where caspase-3 activation is blocked (27Kuida K. Haydar T.F. Kuan C.Y. Gu Y. Taya C. Karasuyama H. Su M.S.

O'Rourke K. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5841-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Previously, Northern blotting analyses suggested the possible existence of different forms of caspase-9 (29Duan H. Orth K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Poirier G.G. Froelich C.J. He W.W. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

To date, only one form of caspase-9 has been cloned and characterized. Therefore, to better understand the functional role of caspase-9 in apoptosis, we cloned another form of caspase-9, named caspase-9S and characterized. The full-length caspase-9 and caspase-9S cDNAs obtained by PCR from human liver cDNA library (Invitrogen) were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The full-length caspase-3 cDNA was amplified by PCR from pKV-caspase-3 (from Dr. R. Talanian) and cloned into pcDNA3. The pCMV-Bax was provided by Dr. E. White (Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ). The expression plasmids for Apaf-1 (22Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar) and FADD (26Pan G. O'Rourke K. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5841-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) described previously were provided by Dr. X. Wang and Dr. V. Dixit, respectively. Human caspase-9S cDNA was cloned by PCR from a human liver cDNA library (Invitrogen) using two primers, 5′-ATGGACGAAGCGGATCGGCGGC-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-TTATGATGTTTTAAAGAAAAGTTTTTTC-3′ (3′-primer). PCR was carried out for 60 s at 95 °C, 60 s at 55 °C, and 70 s at 72 °C for 35 cycles. The resulting PCR products (1250 and 800 bp) were subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene) and sequenced. Total RNA was isolated from MCF-7, A549, HeLa, SK-OV-3, RL95–2, HepG2, and MRC-5 as described (31Seol D.W. Zarnegar R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and subjected to RT-PCR. The same primer set and conditions used for caspase-9S cDNA cloning were employed for PCR. As an internal control for RT-PCR, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA was amplified by PCR at the same experimental condition. PCR products were run in 1% agarose gel, transferred onto the nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to Southern blotting as described (31Seol D.W. Zarnegar R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment encompassing the 294th amino acid to the stop codon of caspase-9 (Fig. 1 B) was used as a probe for Southern blotting. Preparation of whole cell lysates and Western blotting was performed as described (20Kim Y.M. Kim T.H. Seol D.W. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31437-31441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) using anti-human caspase-9 monoclonal antibody (PharMingen) or polyclonal anti-human caspase-9 antibody (Dr. X. Wang). MCF-7 cells were transiently cotransfected with β-galactosidase (pCMVβ-gal) and test expression plasmids using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At the indicated time points after transfection, the number of round blue apoptotic cells out of the total number of blue cells was determined for each condition. A human TRAIL cDNA fragment (amino acids 114–281) obtained by PCR was cloned into the pET-23d (Novagen) plasmid, and expressed protein was purified using the His-bind Resin and Buffer Kit (Novagen). To purify recombinant caspase-9S protein, the full-length caspase-9S cDNA was cloned into pQE30 (Qiagen) bacterial expression vector. Expression and purification followed the procedures described to purify recombinant TRAIL. The cDNA fragment corresponding to residues 1–97 of Apaf-1 was obtained by PCR and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV-GST to generate the GST-Apaf-1(1–97) fusion protein. C-33A cells grown on 60-mm plates were transiently transfected with 5 μg of pCMV-GST or pCMV-GST-Apaf-1(1–97) in order to express the GST or GST-Apaf-1(1–97) proteins. Thirty-six hours after transfection, whole cell lysates were prepared with RIPA lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate in phosphate-buffered saline) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with in vitro translated 35S-caspase-9 or 35S-caspase-9S in binding buffer (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) in the presence or absence of purified caspase-9S. The reaction mixtures were further incubated with glutathione-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C, and the beads were pelleted by centrifugation. Beads were washed five times with binding buffer and boiled for 3 min in 1 × sample buffer. The resulting supernatants were loaded onto 15% SDS gel and visualized by autoradiography. To clone a caspase-9 variant, we employed PCR. PCR using a set of primers encompassing the open reading frame of caspase-9 generated two products (1250 and 800 bp) from human liver cDNA library (data not shown). Nucleotide sequencing revealed that the 1250- and 800-bp PCR products coded for full-length caspase-9 and a shorter variant of caspase-9, respectively. The shorter variant of caspase-9 was named caspase-9S (caspase-9 short form, GenBankTM accession number AF110376). Analyses of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences revealed that caspase-9S was missing sequences coding for most of the large subunit (p17) of caspase-9, including the catalytic site (QACGG) (Fig.1, A and B). The prodomain and small subunit (p12) of caspase-9 were intact in caspase-9S (Fig. 1, A and B). The molecular mass of caspase-9S was estimated to be 30 kDa, and the in vitrotranslated product migrated as a 30-kDa protein on SDS gels (Fig.1 C). We next examined whether caspase-9S transcript is expressed normally in cells. RT-PCR/Southern blotting detected transcripts representing caspase-9 as well as caspase-9S in most cell lines (caspase-9 transcript in A549 cells was only detectable after overexposure) (Fig. 2 A). RT-PCR/Southern blotting also revealed that the ratio of caspase-9 to caspase-9S varied in the different cell lines. In MCF-7, RL95–2 (Fig.2 A), HepG2, and MRC-5 cell lines (data not shown), the expression level of caspase-9 mRNA was higher than that of caspase-9S. In contrast, HeLa and SK-OV-3 cell lines, caspase-9S mRNA expression was detected to be higher than that of caspase-9 (Fig. 2). We have tested two antibodies (obtained from PharMingen and Dr. X. Wang) for their capacity to detect caspase-9 and caspase-9S proteins by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 B). Both antibodies detected only caspase-9 protein. MCF-7 and HeLa cells expressed more caspase-9 protein than A549 cells, correlating with the corresponding message levels. To examine caspase-9S function by transient transfection, the MCF-7 cell line was chosen by two reasons: first, caspase-9S expression was detected to be lower than caspase-9 expression in the cell line; second, the cell line was easily killed by apoptosis stimuli such as TNF-α (without transcription or translation blocker) and TRAIL (see Fig.3 C). Overexpression of caspase-9 or caspase-3-induced apoptosis (Fig.3 A). In contrast, overexpression of caspase-9S did not lead to apoptosis (Fig. 3 A), indicating that the deleted region of caspase-9, including the catalytic site, is crucial for its normal function. The cysteine residue of the catalytic site is well conserved throughout the caspase family members and required for catalytic function. Loss of the catalytic site in caspase-9S most likely accounts for the null activity. Previously, an artificial mutant caspase-9 (C287A), where the catalytic site cysteine residue (Cys, 287th amino acid) was mutated to alanine (Ala), demonstrated dominant-negative activity against wild-type caspase-9 (22Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar, 26Pan G. O'Rourke K. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5841-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Thus, we next examined whether caspase-9S also exhibits dominant-negative activity against wild-type caspase-9. Overexpression of caspase-9S protected cells from apoptosis induced by caspase-9 (Fig. 3 B). This indicated that caspase-9S functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor of caspase-9. Overexpression of caspase-9S also inhibited apoptosis induced by Bax and FADD (Fig. 3 B) as well as by TNF-α and TRAIL (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that caspase-9S blocks a common signaling pathway activated by Bax, FADD, TNF-α, and TRAIL. Previously, Apaf-1 was shown to directly interact with and activate procaspase-9 during apoptosis (22Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). To examine the functional role of caspase-9S in this process, MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with plasmid constructs expressing caspase-9, caspase-9S, or Apaf-1, individually or in combination (Fig.4 A). Transfection of the vector did not significantly affect cell viability (column 1). Cells overexpressing caspase-9 exhibited moderate cell death (column 2), whereas cells overexpressing caspase-9S were mostly viable (column 3). Overexpression of Apaf-1 alone (column 4) or coexpression of Apaf-1 and caspase-9S (column 5) did not induce apoptosis. However, when coexpressed with caspase-9, Apaf-1 significantly increased apoptosis (column 2 versus column 6). This result is in agreement with the previous findings that showed direct activation of caspase-9 by Apaf-1 (22Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Coexpression of caspase-9S inhibited apoptotic cell death induced by the combination of Apaf-1 and caspase-9 (column 7). In order to activate caspase-9, Apaf-1 must interact with the prodomain of caspase-9 (22Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Our data (Fig. 1, B and C, and Fig. 3) suggest that caspase-9S may bind to Apaf-1 through its prodomain as does caspase-9 and compete with caspase-9 for binding to Apaf-1 preventing caspase-9 activation. Therefore, we performedin vitro binding assays to examine this possibility directly (Fig. 4 B). Since the N-terminal 97 amino acids of Apaf-1 has been shown to be responsible for interacting with the prodomain of caspase-9 (22Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M.

Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar), in vitro translated caspase-9 bound to GST-Apaf-1(1–97) (lane 5). Under the same experimental conditions, caspase-9S also efficiently bound to GST-Apaf-1(1–97) (lane 6). However, neither caspase-9 nor caspase-9S bound to GST alone (lanes 3 and 4), indicating that specific interactions occur between Apaf-1(1–97) and caspase-9S. Importantly, the binding of caspase-9 to Apaf-1 was abrogated by caspase-9S (lane 7). These functional and binding assay results indicate that caspase-9S plays as a dominant-negative inhibitor, at least in part, by blocking Apaf-1-caspase-9 interaction through an interaction with Apaf-1. Our data (Figs. 3 and 4) indicate that caspase-9S is an endogenous inhibitor of apoptosis. TNF-α, Fas ligand, TRAIL, and Bax are known to induce the cytochrome c release from mitochondria (23Reed J.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). This suggests that apoptotic signals initiated by such molecules involve Apaf-1 and converge on a biochemical event eliciting caspase-9 activation. This may explain why apoptosis induced by such molecules is blocked by caspase-9S (Figs. 3 and 4) as well as dominant-negative caspase-9 (C287A) (22Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M.

Furthermore, recent studies demonstrated that apoptosis is significantly blocked in caspase-9 knock-out mice, leading to embryonic lethality (27Kuida K. Haydar T.F. Kuan C.Y. Gu Y. Taya C.

These in vitro andin vivo results indicate that caspase-9 plays a critical role in apoptosis. Our functional and binding assays demonstrated that caspase-9S acts as an anti-apoptotic molecule by specifically blocking caspase-9 activation (Fig. 4). However, our data do not rule out the possibility that caspase-9S may directly inhibit enzymatic activity of caspase-9. Caspase-1 and 3 are homodimeric proteins (2Xp17/p12) containing two active sites (32Wilson K.P. Black J.A. Thomson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P. Navia M.A. Murcko M.A. Chambers S.P. Aldape R.A.

Therefore, caspase-9S could form an inactive heterodimeric complex with caspase-9. It has been shown that the MCF-7 cell line does not express caspase-3 (35Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). We have observed this as well (data not shown). However, the cell line is easily killed by various apoptosis-inducing molecules that promote the cytochrome c release. This suggests that Apaf-1/caspase-9 system also functions to activate a downstream executioner caspase(s) other than caspase-3 in this cell line. Caspase-3-like caspases including caspase-6 and caspase-7 have been identified, and it has been shown that caspase-9 also activates caspase-7 (36Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T.

Inappropriate activation of apical caspases such as caspase-9 may cause undesirable activation of downstream caspases, which will be detrimental to cells. Thus, caspase-9S may guard against unwanted caspase-9 activation. FLIP (FLICE-inhibitory protein) acts through a similar mechanism to block procaspase-8, another apical caspase, which interacts with the transmembrane death receptor molecules including TNF-R1 and Fas (37Irmler M.

Consistent with these observations, PAR1 and the S/P chimera were effectively down-regulated by their respective agonists as assessed by both receptor protein levels and signaling.

PAR1 is activated by an irreversible proteolytic mechanism in which thrombin binds to and cleaves the amino-terminal exodomain of the receptor. Receptor cleavage results in the generation of a new amino terminus that functions as a tethered ligand by binding to the body of the receptor to cause transmembrane signaling (2Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T.

A soluble peptide with the sequence SFLLRN representing the first six amino acids carboxyl-terminal to the cleavage site (P1′–P6′) mimics the tethered ligand of PAR1 and acts as a PAR1 agonist. The irreversible proteolytic mechanism of PAR1 activation raises the questions of how this receptor is shut off and how cells maintain the ability to respond to thrombin over time. The β2-adrenergic receptor has served as a prototype for the molecular events responsible for GPCR desensitization and resensitization (Refs. 11Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 337-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Most activated GPCRs are desensitized initially by rapid phosphorylation of the agonist-occupied form of the receptor. Phosphorylated receptor then binds arrestin, which prevents receptor interaction with G proteins, thereby uncoupling it from effectors. Arrestin may also mediate the interaction of β2-adrenergic receptor with clathrin-coated pits, thereby promoting internalization of activated receptors (15Ferguson S.S. Downey W.R. Colapietro A.M.

Within endosomes the β2-adrenergic receptor dissociates from its ligand, is dephosphorylated, and recycles back to the cell surface competent to signal again. In this case trafficking serves to remove activated receptor from the cell surface and to return the receptor to the surface in a off state, ready to respond again to ligand. Like the β2-adrenergic receptor, PAR1 is rapidly phosphorylated and uncoupled from signaling after activation (17Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol.

However, unlike classical GPCRs, activated PAR1 is sorted predominantly to lysosomes after internalization (19Hein L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 13756-13763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To begin to understand the function of intracellular trafficking of PAR1 in regulation of signaling, we first sought to identify the domain(s) that specifies sorting of activated PAR1 to lysosomes. We constructed chimeras between PAR1 and the classic GPCR for substance P (SPR) by exchanging their cytoplasmic carboxyl tails. SPR, also known as the neurokinin-1 receptor, behaves like the β2-adrenergic receptor and other classic GPCRs; it is activated reversibly by the peptide substance P, internalized, and then recycled back to the plasma membrane (23Grady E.F. Garland A.M. Gamp P.D. Lovett M. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 509-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 24Mantyh P.W. DeMaster E. Malhotra A. Ghilardi J.R. Rogers S.D.

Remarkably, exchanging the cytoplasmic carboxyl tails (C-tails) of PAR1 and SPR switched their trafficking behaviors after activation. SPR bearing the C-tail of PAR1 (S/P chimera) internalized upon activation and sorted to lysosomes like wild-type PAR1. Conversely, PAR1 bearing the C-tail of SPR (P/S chimera) internalized upon activation but recycled back to the plasma membrane like wild-type SPR. Recycling versus lysosomal sorting of activated receptors correlated with the extent to which signaling was down-regulated over time. Cells expressing the wild-type substance P receptor and P/S chimera were capable of responding to their cognate agonists even after prolonged agonist exposure. By contrast, signaling by wild-type PAR1 and the S/P chimera was significantly down-regulated. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the cytoplasmic tails of PAR1 and SPR specify their distinct intracellular sorting fates after activation. Moreover, the P/S and S/P chimeras provide reagents for identifying the molecular mechanisms by which PAR1 is sorted to lysosomes and for determining the importance of this process for terminating PAR1 signaling. Monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies, M1 and M2, were purchased from Eastman Kodak. Rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal 1809 antibody was raised to a peptide representing the hirudin-like sequence in the amino-terminal exodomain of PAR1 (6Hung D.T. Vu T.-K.H. Wheaton V.I. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin.

Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody were obtained from Molecular Probes. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was from Life Technologies, Inc. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Bio-Rad and 125I sheep anti-mouse antibody from Amersham International, UK. The PAR1 agonist peptide SFLLRN was synthesized as the carboxyl amide and purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Substance P peptide was purchased from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals. A PAR1 cDNA containing a prolactin signal sequence followed by a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDD) was used for generating mutants (17Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A SPR cDNA with a prolactin signal sequence and FLAG epitope identical to that of PAR1 was generated as follows. NcoI and SalI sites were introduced into a wild-type rat SPR cDNA (gift of Nigel Bunnett, University of California, San Francisco). The NcoI site was positioned such that its ATG sequence coincided with the native SPR start codon and the SalI site was positioned coincident with SPR codons ATGGAT (nucleotide numbers 556–661 in Ref. 26Yokota Y.

A 114-base pairNcoI/SalI fragment encoding the amino acid sequence MDSKGSSQKGSRLLLLLVVSNLLLCQGVVSDYKDDDDVD was then subcloned into these sites. To generate chimeric receptors, a SacI site was inserted in the epitope-tagged PAR1 and SPR cDNAs just 3′ to the sequence encoding the putative palmitoylation sites in these proteins (ILCCKESS for PAR1 and FRCCPFISA for SPR, where the location corresponding to the SacI sites are underlined). These SacI sites were then used to exchange cDNA fragments encoding the carboxyl tails of PAR1 and SPR (Fig.1 B). Mutations in all constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. cDNAs encoding wild-type and chimeric receptors were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pBJ1 (provided by Mark Davis, Stanford University, Stanford, CA) for transfection into cells. Rat1 fibroblasts were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding a neomycin resistance gene and stable transfectants were selected in 800 μg/ml geneticin and screened by surface antibody binding (27Hung D.T. Vu T.-K.H. Nelken N.A. Coughlin S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) supplemented with 5% bovine calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 800 μg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following various treatments, cells were rinsed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 2× SDS-gel loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol). Lysates were sheared by passage through a 28.5-gauge syringe needle, resolved by electrophoresis on a SDS-9% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 15 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (wash buffer) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 3 μg/ml M1 anti-FLAG antibody diluted in the same blocking solution. Membranes were washed, incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:5000) for 1 h at 25 °C, washed again, and then developed using Enhanced Chemiluminescense-ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine receptor half-lives, lysates of cells incubated for various times in the presence or absence of agonist were analyzed by immunoblot in parallel with various equivalents of time 0 samples (100, 80, 40, 20, and 10%). Membranes were analyzed as above but 2 μCi/ml125I sheep anti-mouse antibody was used in place of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Radioactivity associated with receptor bands was quantitated using the Molecular Dynamics Storm imaging system. Standard curves of the time 0 samples were fitted using Microsoft Excel 5.0 regression function, andR values ranged from 0.98 to 1.00. Receptor phosphorylation was examined using a modification of a previously described procedure (18Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol.

Rat1 fibroblasts plated in 6-well dishes (Falcon) were labeled with 250 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (NEN Life Science Products) in phosphate-free DMEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed, incubated with agonists, and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors (18Ishii K.

Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 2× SDS gel loading buffer containing 6 m urea, resolved on a SDS-9% polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed by autoradiography. Stably transfected Rat1 cells were plated on glass coverslips (22 × 22 mm) and cultured overnight in normal DMEM. To follow lysosomal sorting of cell surface receptors, cells were first incubated with primary antibodies diluted in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 4 °C. Rabbit polyclonal antibody 1809 (1:200) was used for immunostaining of PAR1 and P/S chimera, and the rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody (1:100) was used for staining SPR and S/P chimera. Following agonist treatment at 37 °C, cells were fixed for 1 h at 4 °C with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS and then permeabilized in 100% methanol at −20 °C for 30 s. Cells were then washed three times with PBS containing 1% nonfat dry milk, 150 mmsodium acetate, pH 7.0, followed by another three washes with PBS containing only 1% nonfat dry milk (blocking buffer). Following washes, cells were incubated with the lgp120 antibody GM10 for 1 h at 25 °C, washed, and then incubated with Texas Red-X goat anti-mouse and fluorescein goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 1 h at 25 °C. Finally, cells were washed four times with PBS then once with Molecular Probes SlowFade equilibration buffer. One drop of SlowFade anti-fade reagent was added to each slide before mounting the coverslip. Confocal images were collected using a Nikon PCM 2000 laser scanning confocal system configured with an Eclipse E800 microscope fitted with a CFI Plan Apochromat 60× oil objective (Nikon, Corp.). Fluorescein and Texas Red-X images were captured sequentially at 1024 × 1024 resolution with 2× optical zoom in 2 s and processed using C·IMAGING 1280 system (Compix, Inc.). The final image composite was created using Adobe Photoshop 4.0. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to follow internalization and recovery of cell surface receptors. Transfected Rat1 fibroblasts were plated on glass coverslips (22 × 22 mm) and treated as described below for cell surface ELISA. Following fixation with paraformaldehyde, cells were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 h at 25 °C. Cells were then washed four times with PBS and once with SlowFade equilibration buffer, and then one drop of SlowFade reagent was added to each coverslip before mounting. Images were acquired using a Nikon Microphot-FXA fluorescence microscope fitted with a PlanApo 100× oil objective (Nikon Corp.). To follow the cohort of cell surface receptors, transfected Rat1 fibroblasts plated in 24-well culture dishes (Falcon) were incubated with 3 μg/ml M1 anti-FLAG antibody diluted in DMEM/bovine serum albumin/HEPES for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed, warmed to 37 °C, and then exposed to agonists in media containing 10 μm cycloheximide. This concentration of cycloheximide was previously shown to inhibit new receptor synthesis in transfected Rat1 cells (19Hein L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27719-27726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following various treatments, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 4 °C and then washed twice with PBS. Cells were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:1000) for 1 h at 25 °C, washed three times in PBS, and incubated with the horseradish peroxidase substrate 1-Step ABTS (2, 2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Pierce). After 10–15 min, an aliquot was removed, and the optical density was read at 405 nm using a Molecular Devices microplate spectrophotometer. Cells plated in 12-well dishes (Falcon) were labeled overnight with 2 μCi/ml [3H]myo-inositol in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cells were washed and treated as described in the legend to Fig. 6, and the formation of inositol phosphates was assayed as reported previously (28Nanevicz T. Wang L. Chen M. Ishii M. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 702-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To identify the domain(s) that specify the distinct intracellular sorting fates of activated PAR1 and SPR (Fig.1 A), we made chimeras in which the C-tails of these receptors were exchanged carboxyl to their putative palmitoylation sites. PAR1 bearing the SPR C-tail is designated “P/S chimera” and SPR bearing the PAR1 C-tail is designated “S/P chimera” (Fig. 1 B). Both wild-type and chimeric receptors displayed the same FLAG epitope at their extracellular amino termini and were stably expressed in Rat1 fibroblasts. To determine whether wild-type or chimeric receptors were sorted to a degradative pathway upon activation, we incubated receptor-expressing cell lines in the presence or absence of agonist for 90 min and then assessed the amount of receptor protein in cell lysates by immunoblot using anti-FLAG antibodies. Immunoblot of lysates from untreated PAR1-expressing cells revealed one major transfection-dependent band migrating at 68 kDa (Fig.2 A). Incubation with PAR1 agonist peptide SFLLRN caused a striking decrease in the intensity of this band; this loss was even more evident when new receptor synthesis was blocked with cycloheximide (Fig. 2 A). Immunoblot of lysates prepared from SPR-expressing cells showed a transfection-dependent band migrating at ∼60 kDa. Exposure of cells to substance P caused a decrease in mobility of this band, probably due to receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 2 F), but had no significant effect on the level of receptor protein even when cycloheximide was included (Fig. 2 B). Strikingly, PAR1 bearing the SPR C-tail (P/S chimera) behaved very much like wild-type SPR in this assay. The PAR1 agonist peptide SFLLRN caused a decrease in the mobility of the P/S chimera but little or no loss of P/S receptor protein (Fig. 2 C). Immunoblot of lysates prepared from cells expressing a SPR bearing the C-tail of PAR1 (S/P chimera) revealed three transfection-dependent bands (Fig. 2 D). Exposure of S/P expressing cells to trypsin at 4 °C caused a decrease in the intensity of the intermediate ∼50-kDa band but not the other bands (data not shown), suggesting that only the 50-kDa form of the S/P chimera was expressed on the cell surface and cleaved by extracellular protease. Moreover, only the 50-kDa form was phosphorylated upon exposing cells to substance P (Fig. 2 H). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the 50-kDa band represents a properly processed and activatable form of this receptor chimera. Interestingly, the 50-kDa band was the only form markedly reduced in cells incubated with substance P (Fig. 2 D), consistent with the notion that it undergoes agonist-dependent sorting to a degradation pathway (see below). The structural basis for misfolding or improper processing of the other species of S/P protein is unknown. Of note, when analogous chimeras were made between PAR1 and β2-adrenergic receptor, no functional chimeric receptors were obtained (data not shown). It is possible that in such chimeras, interactions between the C-tail and the body of the receptor led to misfolding or misprocessing or that conflicting trafficking signals interfered with their biogenesis. By contrast, generation of chimeras between PAR1 and SPR did yield receptors capable of mediating signaling, and we have chosen to focus on the agonist-dependent trafficking behaviors of these chimeras in the current study to avoid events involving improperly processed receptors. PAR1 was phosphorylated within 3 min of exposure to agonist peptide SFLLRN, but no phosphorylated receptor was detected in PAR1-expressing cells after prolonged exposure to agonist (Fig. 2 E). Only the middle band representing the S/P chimera showed phosphorylation upon addition of ligand, again consistent with this band representing functional chimeric receptor expressed at the cell surface (Fig. 2 H). As with wild-type PAR1, little or no detectable phosphorylated S/P chimera was detected after 90 min of exposure to agonist. These findings are consistent with the nearly complete degradation of PAR1 after 90 min of agonist treatment (Fig. 2 A). Wild-type SPR was also rapidly phosphorylated upon exposure to agonist, but in contrast to PAR1, phosphorylated SPR was still detected after prolonged exposure of cells to substance P (Fig. 2 F). SPR phosphorylation was reversible within 30 min of agonist withdrawal (data not shown), and new receptor synthesis was blocked in these studies, thus detection of phosphorylated SPR after 90 min of constant exposure to agonist is consistent with ongoing activation and phosphorylation of recycled receptors. The P/S chimera behaved like SPR in this regard, showing continued phosphorylation in the presence of agonist peptide SFLLRN and reversible phosphorylation upon removal of peptide agonist (Fig. 2 G and data not shown). We next examined the effect of lysosomal inhibitors on agonist-induced changes in the half-lives of wild-type and chimeric receptors in these cell lines as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Incubation with agonist decreased the half-life of wild-type PAR1 by a remarkable 18-fold (Table I). Similarly, the S/P chimera 50-kDa band showed a marked ∼7-fold decrease in half-life in the presence of agonist. By contrast, wild-type SPR and P/S chimera showed only modest decreases in half-life of ∼0.5- and ∼2-fold, respectively, upon exposure to agonist. To test whether agonist-promoted degradation of PAR1 and the S/P chimera required active lysosomal hydrolases, we incubated cells with chloroquine or NH4Cl and then assayed the amount of receptor protein remaining after incubation in the presence or absence of agonist. Chloroquine or NH4Cl did not block internalization of PAR1 or SPR (data not shown). However, the striking agonist-induced decreases in cellular PAR1 and S/P chimera protein levels were substantially attenuated by these lysosomal hydrolase inhibitors (TableI). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that PAR1 and the 50-kDa form of the S/P chimera are degraded in lysosomes after activation and internalization.Table IEffect of agonist and lysosomal hydrolase inhibitors on receptor degradationReceptorReceptor protein remainingHalf-lifeNo inhibitorChloroquineNH4Cl−+−+−+−+h%PAR1SFLLRN90.5SFLLRN100171009610053SPRSubstance P96NDNDNDNDNDNDP/S chimeraSFLLRN73NDNDNDNDNDNDS/P chimeraSubstance P40.6Substance P100231007010070Stably transfected Rat1 cells expressing epitope-tagged PAR1, SPR, P/S chimera, and S/P chimera were used to determine receptor half-lives and to examine the effect of lysomotrophic agents on receptor degradation.

Using degenerate polymerase chain reaction, we have isolated a human cDNA encoding a protein kinase homologous to STE20. This protein kinase, designated HPK/GCK-like kinase (HGK), has nucleotide sequences that encode an open reading frame of 1165 amino acids with 11 kinase subdomains. HGK was a serine/threonine protein kinase that specifically activated the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway when transfected into 293T cells, but it did not stimulate either the extracellular signal-regulated kinase or p38 kinase pathway. HGK also increased AP-1-mediated transcriptional activity in vivo. HGK-induced JNK activation was inhibited by the dominant-negative MKK4 and MKK7 mutants. The dominant-negative mutant of TAK1, but not MEKK1 or MAPK upstream kinase (MUK), strongly inhibited HGK-induced JNK activation. TNF-α activated HGK in 293T cells, as well as the dominant-negative HGK mutants, inhibited TNF-α-induced JNK activation. These results indicate that HGK, a novel activator of the JNK pathway, may function through TAK1, and that the HGK → TAK1 → MKK4, MKK7 → JNK kinase cascade may mediate the TNF-α signaling pathway.

The c-June N-terminal kinase (JNK)1 family members belong to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily, which also includes extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and the p38 family (reviewed in Ref. 1Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). MAPK superfamily members are serine/threonine-directed kinases that target other kinases, transcription factors, and membrane receptor tails, causing diverse effects such as cell proliferation, transformation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Activation of MAPK members occurs through an assembly of kinase cascades in response to stimuli. The original MAPK cascade (c-Raf → MEK1/2 → ERK1/2) includes activation of the serine/threonine kinase c-Raf, which activates a dual-specificity MAPK kinase (MEK1/MEK2). MAPK/ERK is then activated via tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation of the T-X-Y motif on the phosphorylation loop of the enzyme. This phosphorylation event causes local and global conformational changes in the protein, resulting in an active enzyme structure. The JNK family members were characterized biochemically as two kinases and cloned from human fetal brain and rat brain libraries (2Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M.

Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). Presently, the JNK family consists of three genes, JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3, which can be subdivided further into 10 isoforms (4Gupta S. Battett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). JNK1 and JNK2 have four isoforms, while JNK3 has two isoforms; these isoforms arise from alternative splicing. Their murine homologues are called stress-activated protein kinases (3Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). Active JNKs target Ser-Pro and Thr-Pro motifs on their substrates. Substrates for JNK family members include the transcription factors c-Jun, JunD, ATF-2, Elk-1, Sap-1a, and p53; phosphorylation of c-Jun, ATF-2, Elk-1, and Sap-1a increases their transcriptional activity (reviewed in Ref. 1Whitmarsh A.J.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 135-142PubMed Google Scholar). JNK kinase activity can be activated by various agents, including the proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and interleukin-1), G protein-coupled receptors, lymphocyte co-stimulatory receptors (CD28 and CD40), osmotic shock, heat shock, protein synthesis inhibitors, ceramides, DNA-damaging chemicals, UV irradiation, and ionizing radiation (reviewed in Ref. 1Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Activation of JNK involves the upstream kinases MKK4 (also called SEK1) (11Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T.

Thus far, p21 (Rac1/Cdc42)-activated kinases (PAKs) and HPK/GCK-related kinases (HPK1, GCK, GLK, and KHS) have been identified as potential upstream kinases for MEKK1. This kinase cascade has been suggested by many laboratories as follows: HPK1, GCK, PAKs → MEKKs → MKK4, MKK7 → JNKs. There is also evidence suggesting that MAPKKKs (e.g.MEKKs and MLK-3) are parallel to, but not downstream of, PAKs and HPK/GCK family kinases (reviewed in Ref. 22Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C.

We report here the isolation and characterization of a novel human protein kinase, HGK (HPK/GCK-like kinase), which is homologous to STE20. Expression of HGK specifically activates the JNK signaling pathway. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed to the conserved regions (kinase subdomains VI and VIII) of the serine/threonine protein kinase and used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described previously (32Wang X.S.

Replicate filters from a human λ phage macrophage library were prehybridized for 2 h at 42 °C in 5× standard saline citrate (SSC), 1× Denhardt's solution containing 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, and then hybridized to the [γ-32P]dCTP-labeled, 180-base pair probe (overnight in the same solution). After hybridization, the filters were washed twice for 30 min in 0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Positive clones were isolated and sequenced on both strands. Filters containing poly(A)+ RNA (2 μg/lane) from various tissues were purchased from CLONTECH. Filters were probed with an HGK probe corresponding to the non-catalytic region of HGK. Hybridization was performed at 68 °C in Express Hybridization Buffer (CLONTECH), followed by three washes in 0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Blots were exposed for 24 h at −70 °C. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were kindly provided by Dr. M. C.-T. Hu (Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA). 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1× penicillin/streptomycin. 293T cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/100-mm dish (or 1.5 × 105 cells/35-mm plate as indicated) and transfected the next day using the calcium phosphate precipitation protocol (Specialty Media, Inc.) The amounts of DNA used for each transfection were as indicated, and empty vector was used to achieve equal amounts of DNA in each transfection. A monoclonal antibody (12CA5) against the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. The monoclonal antibody (M2) against the Flag epitope was purchased from Kodak, Inc. To generate polyclonal rabbit anti-HGK antibody, a synthetic peptide (CNPTNTRPQSDTPEIRKYKKRFN) corresponding to the peptide sequence 823–844 of HGK was synthesized, then coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via the cysteine residue at the N terminus, and used to immunize rabbits. Antibody affinity purification was done as described previously (27Diener D. Wang X.S. Chen C. Meyer C.F. Keesler G. Zukowski M. Tan T.-H. Yao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Full-length HGK was cloned into pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) and pCI (Promega, Madison, WI) vectors by PCR using two oligonucleotide primers. An N-terminal Flag epitope sequence was added.

MAPKs were precipitated by incubation with specific antibodies and protein A-agarose beads (Bio-Rad) in an incubation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mmEGTA, 50 mm glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4). The precipitates were washed twice with incubation buffer, twice with LiCl buffer (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100), and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mmNa3VO4), then mixed with 5 μg of the indicated substrates, 15 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 30 μl of kinase buffer. The kinase reaction was performed at 30 °C for 30 min and terminated with an equal volume of SDS sampling buffer. The reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS-PAGE analysis. The Western blot analysis, antibody incubation, and ECL detection were described previously (25Hu M.C.-T. Qu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). After the immunocomplex kinase assay, proteins were separated using a 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane at 40 V overnight in 10 mm Tris, 1 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. The radioactive myelin basic protein (MBP) bands were identified and excised by alignment of the autoradiogram to PVDF membrane. The PVDF membrane was soaked first in methanol and then in deionized water. The proteins on the PVDF membrane were then hydrolyzed in 250 μl of 6n HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. The acid containing partially hydrolyzed phosphoamino acids were pooled and lyophilized. The lyophilized samples were washed twice with 50 μl of deionized water. The final dried pellets were resuspended in 5 μl of 5.9% glacial acetic acid, 0.8% formic acid, 0.3% pyridine, and 0.3 mm EDTA, pH 2.5, spiked with phosphorylated serine, threonine, and tyrosine standards, and spotted on a 20 × 20-cm TLC plate. The phosphoamino acids were separated in the pH 2.5 buffer at 20 mA for 2 h. The phosphoamino acid standards were visualized by spraying the plate with 0.3% ninhydrin in acetone. The32P-labeled residues were detected by autoradiography. In order to identify novel members of the mammalian STE20 family of protein kinases, we employed a degenerate PCR strategy to amplify cDNA from a human macrophage cDNA library. A PCR fragment containing novel sequences with homology to the STE20 family of protein kinases was identified. This cDNA fragment was subsequently used to screen a human macrophage cDNA library. Four cDNA clones of varying sizes were isolated, and the one containing the longest insert (3950 base pairs) was sequenced on both strands. The complete nucleotide sequence of the cDNA predicted an open reading frame of 1165 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 133.40 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence encoded a kinase catalytic domain in the N terminus that contained 11 kinase subdomains (Fig. 1, Aand B). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the putative kinase domain of HGK with other sequences found that the HGK kinase domain was most similar to HPK1, GLK, GCK, KHS, and STE20. Within the kinase domain, HGK displays 47% amino acid identity to the catalytic domain of the HPK1, 52% amino acid identity to the catalytic domain of the human GLK, 48% amino acid identity to the catalytic domain of the GCK, 48% amino acid identity to the catalytic domain of the KHS, and 39% amino acid identity to S. cerevisiae Ste20. The amino acid sequence alignment of the catalytic domain of HGK with that of related kinases is shown in Fig.1 B. Unlike HPK1 and GCK, HGK does not contain proline-rich regions: the putative Src homology 3 domain binding regions. However, one of the HGK cDNA clones contains an additional 77 amino acids with two proline-rich regions (Fig. 1 C). To determine whether other forms of HGK exist that contain the proline-rich regions, reverse transcriptase PCR using two primers to flank the region was employed to amplify cDNA from human brain, liver, skeletal muscle, and placenta. Sequencing analysis of the PCR products found that, although the longer form appears to be more abundant in the brain, the short form is the predominant form in human liver, skeletal muscle, and placenta (data not shown). The expression of HGK was examined in a variety of human tissues by Northern blot analysis using a probe from the non-conserved C-terminal coding region of HGK. The HGK probe hybridized to three transcripts of approximately 4.6, 6.5, and 8.5 kilobase pairs in all tissues examined, suggesting a ubiquitous tissue distribution (Fig.2 A). To determine the expression of endogenous HGK protein, a polyclonal antibody to HGK was generated and purified by affinity chromatography. This antibody specifically recognized a protein of approximately 130 kDa in MCF-7, 293, HeLa, PC3, LNCaP, and Jurkat cells, as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 B). The specificity of the anti-HGK antibody was further confirmed in 293T cells transfected with a Flag-tagged HGK cDNA expression plasmid. Both the anti-HGK antibody and the anti-Flag antibody recognized specifically the Flag-tagged HGK proteins in the HGK-transfected 293T cells (Fig. 2 C). HGK phosphorylated the substrate MBP (Fig.3 A). As controls, the HGK catalytically inactive mutants (HGK-KR and HGK-KE, which contain lysine 54 to arginine substitution and lysine 54 to glutamic acid substitution, respectively) did not phosphorylate the substrate MBP (Fig. 3 A), indicating that the HGK kinase activity observed was not attributable to coimmunoprecipitated kinases. Furthermore, phosphoamino acid analysis of in vitro phosphorylated MBP detected phosphorylated serines and threonines only (Fig.3 B), establishing HGK as a serine/threonine protein kinase.Figure 3Catalytic activity of HGK. A, 293T cells (1.5 × 105/35-mm well) were transfected with 2 μg of an empty vector (pCI), HGK, HGK-KR, and HGK-KE. The cells were collected 40 h after transfection. Immunocomplex kinase assays were performed with an anti-Flag antibody (M2) using MBP as the substrate. Equivalent levels of wild-type and mutant HGK expression were verified by immunoblotting using an anti-Flag antibody (M2;bottom panel). B, HGK is a serine/threonine protein kinase. 293T cells (1.5 × 105) were transfected with 2 μg of a Flag-HGK plasmid. The cells were harvested at 44 h after transfection. Immunocomplex kinase assays were performed with an anti-Flag antibody (M2) using MBP as a substrate. After electrophoresis in 12% SDS-PAGE, the protein was transferred to PVDF. Phosphorylated MBP was excised from the blot and used to perform phosphoamino acid analysis. The positions of phosphorylated serine (p-Ser), phosphorylated threonine (p-Thr), and phosphorylated tyrosine (p-Tyr) are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether HGK can activate JNK, 293T cells were co-transfected with mammalian expression vectors encoding HGK and an HA epitope-tagged JNK1. Recombinant JNK was then immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and used in a protein kinase assay with GST-c-Jun-(1–79) as a substrate. Transfection with HGK resulted in strong JNK1 activation (Fig.4 A, lane 3), while cells transfected with vector showed little JNK1 activation (lanes 1 and 2). Transfection of a kinase-inactive form of HGK, in which lysine 54 in the ATP binding domain was mutated to a glutamic acid, did not result in JNK activation (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). Thus, the kinase activity of HGK is required for JNK activation. To determine whether HGK can also activate the p38 kinase or ERK, 293T cells were transiently transfected with HGK along with HA-tagged p38 or HA-tagged ERK2. p38 kinase and ERK2 were then immunoprecipitated and their activities assayed using ATF-2 or MBP peptides as substrates. Even though MKK6 activated p38 (Fig. 4 B, lane 4) and the activated c-Raf1, Raf-BXB, strongly activated ERK2 (Fig. 4 C, lane 4), neither p38 or ERK kinase activities were increased when HGK was overexpressed in 293T cells (Fig. 4, B and C, lane 3). These data suggest that the activation of JNK by HGK is specific. Because c-Jun is a substrate of JNK and the expression of HGK can activate the JNK signaling pathway, we tested whether the expression of HGK can result in the activation of c-Jun transcriptional activity in vivo. Cells were transfected with an HGK expression plasmid and a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter construct (5xTRE-CAT) containing five copies of the c-Jun-binding sites (AP1-binding sites). CAT assays were performed 44 h after transfection. Co-transfection of HGK plus JNK1 stimulated the transcriptional activity mediated by AP-1 (about 7-fold) as compared with cells transfected with vector control (Fig. 4 D). JNK1 or HGK alone showed minimal AP1-CAT induction (about 1.5-fold). Due to the low levels of JNK expression in 293T cells, inclusion of the JNK plasmid in the transfection assay was necessary in order to detect optimal AP-1 induction by HGK via the HGK → TAK1 → MKK4,7 → JNK kinase cascade. Co-transfection of cells with JNK1 and a kinase-negative mutant of HGK did not increase the transcriptional activity of AP-1. This result indicates that HGK can activate JNK, which in turn stimulates the transcriptional activity of c-Jun in vivo. MKK4 is an upstream activator of JNK which phosphorylates and activates JNK. Recently, another MAPKK/MKK, called MKK7, has been cloned and found to specifically activate JNK, but not p38 and ERK. To determine whether HGK activates JNK through MKK4 and MKK7, we co-transfected cells with an expression plasmid expressing HGK and a dominant-negative mutant of MKK4/SEK1 (SEK-AL) or a dominant-negative mutant of MKK7 (MKK7-K76E) to determine whether they can inhibit HGK-induced JNK activation. The expression of a dominant-negative form of MKK4 or MKK7 inhibited JNK activity induced by HGK (Fig.5 A) and GLK (Fig.5 B), indicating that HGK functions upstream of MKK4 and/or MKK7. The MAPK kinase kinase MEKK1 is a direct activator of MKK4, which in turn phosphorylates and activates JNK. In addition, MEKK1 was shown to function downstream of HPK1 and GLK (25Hu M.C.-T. Qu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 27Diener D. Wang X.S. Chen C. Meyer C.F. Keesler G. Zukowski M. Tan T.-H. Yao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9687-9692Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), two kinases that are highly homologous to HGK. To determine whether HGK also activates JNK through MEKK1, we analyzed the effect of the kinase-inactive mutant MEKK1 (MEKK-KR) on HGK-induced JNK activation. In repeated experiments, we found that, although the MEKK1-KR mutant strongly inhibited HPK-induced JNK activation (Fig.6 B), it did not efficiently block HGK-stimulated JNK activity (Fig. 6 A). These results suggest that HGK utilizes different downstream kinases for signaling. TAK1 was shown to function downstream of HPK1 (20Wang W. Zhou G. Hu M.C.-T. Yao Z. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22771-22775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar); hence, we tested whether HGK activates JNK through TAK1. We co-transfected cells with HGK plus the dominant-negative mutant of either TAK1 (TAK-K63W) or MUK (MUK-KN), and determined their effects on HGK-induced JNK activation. We found that the kinase-negative TAK1 mutant (TAK-K63W), but not the MUK mutant, significantly inhibited HGK-induced JNK activation (Fig.7). This result strongly suggests that TAK1 is a downstream target for HGK activity in the JNK signaling cascade.Figure 7HGK-induced JNK activation is specifically blocked by the dominant-negative TAK1 mutant, TAK-K63W. 293T cells (1.5 × 105/35-mm cell wells) were transfected with 0.1 μg of pHA-JNK1 alone (lane 1), 0.1 μg of pHA-JNK1 and 2 μg of pCI-HGK plus empty vector (lane 2), 2 μg of dominant-negative pEF-TAK1-K63W (lane 3), and 2 μg of dominant-negative pT7tag-MUK-KN (lane 4). Empty vector (pCI) was used to normalize the amount of transfected DNA. Immunocomplex kinase assays were done 44 h after transfection with an anti-HA antibody (12CA5) using GST-c-Jun as the substrate (top panel). Equivalent expression levels of HA-JNK1 and Flag-HGK were verified by immunoblotting using anti-HA (12CA5) and anti-Flag (M2) antibodies, respectively (bottom panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since TNF-α stimulates TAK1 and JNK kinase activity (19Shirakabe K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8141-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and HGK was found to be an upstream kinase of TAK1 and JNK (this study), we tested whether TNF-α can also regulate HGK kinase activity. To study the activation of HGK, an expression construct encoding the Flag epitope-tagged HGK was transiently transfected into 293T cells. The HGK-transfected 293T cells were treated with TNF-α, and the cell lysates were prepared and subjected to in vitro immune complex kinase assays. After TNF-α stimulation, HGK kinase activity increased within 1 min and peaked at 5 min (Fig. 8 A). Equivalent levels of overexpressed HGK were verified by immunoblotting with anti-Flag (M2) antibody (bottom panel). This result indicates that TNF-α stimulated HGK kinase activity. Like many other STE20-like and MEKK-like kinases, HGK kinase regulation using in vitro kinase assays was extremely difficult to detect (see above). Hence, we used the dominant-negative HGK mutants to further address the role of HGK in the TNF-α-mediated JNK activation (Fig. 8 B, top panel). 293T cells were transfected with HA-JNK plus empty vector, HA-JNK plus the dominant-negative HGK mutant HGK-KR, or HA-JNK plus the the dominant-negative HGK mutant HGK-KE. Transfected cells were then treated with TNF-α, followed by immunocomplex JNK kinase assays. We found that the dominant-negative HGK mutants (HGK-KR or HGK-KE) inhibited TNF-α-stimulated JNK activation (Fig. 8 B,top panel, lanes 3 and4). Equivalent levels of HA-JNK1 expression were verified by immunoblotting using anti-HA (12CA5) antibody (bottom panel). Taken together, our results indicate that HGK is involved in the TNF-α-induced signaling pathway. A human kinase homologous to yeast STE20, called HGK, was cloned. HGK shares both sequence and structural homology with several known members of the mammalian STE20 family of kinases, including HPK1, GLK, GCK, and KHS. HGK has a catalytic domain in its N terminus and a long putative regulatory region. The C terminus of HGK does not appear to contain the Cdc42/Rac1 binding motifs found in the PAK family of protein kinases (35Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Like HPK1, GLK, GCK, and KHS, overexpression of HGK in 293T cells strongly activates the JNK pathway, but has no effect on either the ERK or p38 signaling pathways, suggesting that HGK-induced JNK activation is specific. Although the C-terminal domain of HGK does not contain the Cdc42/Rac1 binding motifs, it appears to act as a dominant-negative mutant. Therefore, the C-terminal domain may interact with other signaling molecules that are important for HGK kinase activation. Interestingly, HGK-mediated JNK activation was not affected by the dominant-negative mutant of MEKK1, which is a potent JNK activator. In contrast, JNK activation stimulated by the highly homologous kinase, HPK1, can be efficiently blocked by this mutant. Similarly, our previous studies found that GLK-induced JNK activation is also inhibited by a dominant-negative mutant of MEKK1 (27Diener D. Wang X.S. Chen C. Meyer C.F. Keesler G. Zukowski M. Tan T.-H. Yao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9687-9692Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These data suggest that HGK may function independently of MEKK1 and that different STE20-like protein kinases may signal through different downstream MAPKKKs. At the MAPKKK level, there are several kinases that can activate the JNK pathway. Among several MAPKKKs tested, we found that only the dominant-negative TAK1 mutant strongly inhibited HGK-induced JNK activation. TAK1 was originally identified as a kinase that can activate the p38 kinase signaling pathway. More recent data found that TAK1 can also potently activate the JNK pathway (19Shirakabe K. Yamaguchi K.

Hu M.C.-T. Yao Z. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22771-22775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, HGK likely utilizes TAK1 as its downstream kinase. Two isoforms of human HGK were detected, one of which has a deletion in the region that contains two proline-rich domains. The proline-rich region, contained in the long isoform of HGK, may mediate its interaction with other Src homology 3 domain-containing adaptors. The fact that human HGK that is missing this region can activate the JNK pathway indicates that this region is not essential for JNK activation in transfected 293T cells. It appears that the isoform that contained the proline-rich region was predominantly expressed in the brain, while the shorter form was more abundantly expressed in other tissues such as human liver, skeletal muscle, and placenta (data not shown). The differential expression of different isoforms of HGK suggests that these different isoforms might have tissue- and/or cell-specific functions and may be regulated by different mechanisms. The specificity of JNK activation is not well understood at the present time. Given that the JNK pathway is activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli including UV irradiation, ionizing radiation, heat shock, osmotic stress, protein synthesis inhibitors, apoptosis-inducing agents, and proinflammatory cytokines, it should not be surprising that multiple mammalian STE20-like protein kinases can mediate JNK activation. One plausible mechanism of controlling the specificity of JNK activation is to have different upstream kinases, each responding to distinct stimuli. In addition, different mammalian STE20-like protein kinases might have cell-type specific functions; for example, HPK1 may have a specific function in hematopoietic progenitor cells, as its transcripts are preferentially expressed in hematopoietic organs and cell lines (25Hu M.C.-T.

Our preliminary result also suggests that HGK is involved in the UV-C-mediated signaling pathway. Current studies are focused on elucidating the underlying mechanisms of the HGK → TAK1 → MKK4, MKK7 → JNK kinase cascade in UV-C and TNF-α signaling pathways.

Because their expression is regulated in a tissue-specific manner, each ERM protein has been proposed to have unique functions. On the other hand, experiments at the cellular level and in vitro have suggested their functional redundancy. To assess the possible unique functions of ERM proteins in vivo, the moesin gene located on the X chromosome was disrupted by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. Male mice hemizygous for the mutation as well as homozygous females were completely devoid of moesin but developed normally and were fertile, with no obvious histological abnormalities in any of the tissues examined. In the tissues of the mutant mice, moesin completely disappeared without affecting the expression levels or subcellular distribution of ezrin and radixin. Also, in platelets, fibroblasts, and mast cells isolated from moesin-deficient mice, targeted disruption of the moesin gene did not affect their ERM-dependent functions, i.e. platelet aggregation, stress fiber/focal contact formation of fibroblasts, and microvillar formation of mast cells, without compensatory up-regulation of ezrin or radixin.

Targeted disruption of ERM protein genes would be one of the most direct ways to approach this issue. Among the ERM proteins, we expected moesin to be rather functionally unique, partly because this molecule lacks the polyproline stretch found in both ezrin and radixin and partly because only moesin is not tyrosine phosphorylated by the epidermal growth factor receptor (39Franck Z.

In this study, we generated male and female mice hemi- and homozygous, respectively, for a null mutation in the moesin gene located on the X chromosome. Surprisingly, the mutant mice exhibited no obvious abnormalities in appearance or fertility, and a systemic histological scan of mutant tissues revealed no abnormalities. Our results clearly demonstrated that moesin is not required for normal mouse development or for survival in the laboratory environment. This is surprising in view of the degree of conservation of the moesin gene, for example, the occurrence of a moesin gene inDrosophila (55Edwards K.A. Montague R.A. Shepard S. Edgar B.A. Erikson R.L.

Furthermore, ezrin, radixin, and moesin are not always colocalized. From these in situ observations in wild-type mice, ezrin, radixin, and moesin have been suggested to have specific functions. However, experiments in vitro or at the cellular level have not clearly identified differences in function between these molecules. When the expression of any one or two ERM proteins was selectively suppressed by antisense oligonucleotides, no phenotypic changes were detected, and cell-cell/cell-matrix adhesion and microvillar formation were affected only when expression of all family members was suppressed (40Takeuchi K. Sato N. Kasahara H. Funayama N. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the NH2-terminal halves of all ERM proteins directly bound to the cytoplasmic domains of CD44, Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor, and PIP2 (23Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).The present results favor the notion that ERM proteins are functionally redundant also at the whole body level. Interestingly, in moesin-deficient mice as well as isolated moesin-deficient cells, targeted disruption of the moesin gene did not induce compensatory up-regulation of the other members of the ERM family. In any of the tissues examined in mutant mice, no changes were detected in the expression levels or subcellular distributions of ezrin or radixin. More importantly, in isolated moesin-deficient cells such as platelets and mast cells, in which moesin was predominantly expressed in wild-type cells, moesin completely disappeared, leaving relatively small amounts of ezrin and radixin. The aggregation activity of moesin-deficient platelets and the microvillar formation of moesin-deficient mast cells were not affected. Considering that ERM proteins were thought to be directly involved in platelet aggregation (54Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 31377-31385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and microvillar formation (4Gould K.L. Cooper J.A. Bretscher A. Hunter T. J.

Furthmayr H. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we concluded that only a small fraction of total ERM proteins in wild-type platelets and mast cells are sufficient for their physiological functions. Similar observations, i.e. no phenotypic changes in knockout mice without up-regulation of other family members, has been reported in various systems. For example, mice devoid of components of intermediate-sized filaments such as vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein developed normally without compensatory expression of other intermediate filament components (62Colucci-Guyon E.

Itohara S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 29-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar).Another issue that we should discuss here is the function of moesin in intracellular signaling. We proposed that the cross-linking activities of ERM proteins were regulated by the Rho-dependent signaling pathway through direct binding to Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor and/or through Rho-dependent posphorylation (23Hirao M.

Ezrin and radixin bound to Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor with similar binding constants to moesin and were phosphorylated by Rho kinase with similar efficiency to moesin in vitro. Mackay et al. (36Mackay D.J.G. Esch F. Furthmayr H. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) found that moesin was required for the Rho-dependent formation of stress fibers and focal contacts in permeabilized Swiss 3T3 cells. Also in this case, moesin was able to be replaced by ezrin and radixin. From the present results, we concluded that the functions of ERM proteins in the Rho-dependent signaling pathway are redundant also at the whole body level.In conclusion, the present observations were consistent with the notion that ERM proteins are functionally redundant. The possibility cannot be excluded that a more distantly related protein to moesin in the band 4.1 superfamily functionally compensates for the lack of moesin. Further generation of mutant mice lacking ERM proteins, both singly and in combination, will lead to a better understanding of the physiological relevance of the occurrence of these three closely related proteins. Three closely related proteins, ezrin, radixin, and moesin constitute a gene family called the ERM1 family. Ezrin, radixin, and moesin were identified in different directions (1Bretscher A. J.

In any of the tissues examined in mutant mice, no changes were detected in the expression levels or subcellular distributions of ezrin or radixin. More importantly, in isolated moesin-deficient cells such as platelets and mast cells, in which moesin was predominantly expressed in wild-type cells, moesin completely disappeared, leaving relatively small amounts of ezrin and radixin. The aggregation activity of moesin-deficient platelets and the microvillar formation of moesin-deficient mast cells were not affected.

Similar observations, i.e. no phenotypic changes in knockout mice without up-regulation of other family members, has been reported in various systems. For example, mice devoid of components of intermediate-sized filaments such as vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein developed normally without compensatory expression of other intermediate filament components (62Colucci-Guyon E.

Ezrin and radixin bound to Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor with similar binding constants to moesin and were phosphorylated by Rho kinase with similar efficiency to moesin in vitro. Mackay et al.

Also in this case, moesin was able to be replaced by ezrin and radixin. From the present results, we concluded that the functions of ERM proteins in the Rho-dependent signaling pathway are redundant also at the whole body level.In conclusion, the present observations were consistent with the notion that ERM proteins are functionally redundant. The possibility cannot be excluded that a more distantly related protein to moesin in the band 4.1 superfamily functionally compensates for the lack of moesin. Further generation of mutant mice lacking ERM proteins, both singly and in combination, will lead to a better understanding of the physiological relevance of the occurrence of these three closely related proteins.

In this study, we generated male and female mice hemi- and homozygous, respectively, for a null mutation in the moesin gene located on the X chromosome. Surprisingly, the mutant mice exhibited no obvious abnormalities in appearance or fertility, and a systemic histological scan of mutant tissues revealed no abnormalities. Our results clearly demonstrated that moesin is not required for normal mouse development or for survival in the laboratory environment.

https://openalex.org/W1991990844,"The possibility that the Dbl family member Lfc can activate Rac1 in cells is investigated in this study. Previously, we demonstrated that both Lfc and Lsc, like their closest relative Lbc, can act catalytically in stimulating the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of RhoA in vitro. Neither Lfc nor Lsc stimulated the in vitro exchange activity of Cdc42 or Rac1; however, Lfc was capable of forming a tight complex with Rac1 in vitro. We show here that Lfc stimulates c-Jun kinase (JNK) activity in COS-7 cells. This stimulation was blocked by a dominant negative mutant of Rac1 and somewhat less effectively by dominant negative RhoA, but not by dominant negative Cdc42. Overexpression of Lfc in NIH 3T3 cells induced the formation of actin stress fibers and membrane ruffles, consistent with the activation of both RhoA and Rac1 signaling pathways, whereas overexpression of Lsc led exclusively to well developed stress fibers. Using a recently developed assay for measuring the cellular activation of Rac, we did not find that expression of Lfc increased the levels of GTP-bound Rac1. However, an examination of the cellular localization of Lfc showed that it was localized to microtubules, similar to what has been reported for activated Rac1, the mixed lineage kinase (MLK) and JNK. Moreover, we have found that the Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Lfc specifically associates with tubulin. Taken together, these findings suggest a model where the PH domain-mediated localization of Lfc to microtubules enables the recruitment of Rac to a site proximal to its signaling targets, resulting in JNK activation and actin cytoskeletal changes.

Lfc was initially identified based on its transforming activity when overexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells (1Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The Lfc oncoprotein is a member of the Dbl family of growth regulatory proteins. Many members of the Dbl family have been demonstrated to function upstream of the Rho-related GTP-binding proteins, acting as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 by stimulating the exchange of GTP for GDP and thereby promoting G protein activation. This rapidly growing family of regulatory proteins includes greater than 20 members to date (reviewed in Ref. 2Whitehead I.P. Cambell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The fact that there exist so many GEFs for the Rho subfamily suggests that there will be multiple pathways leading to the activation of an individual GTP-binding protein. All members of the Dbl family possess a Dbl homology (DH) domain in tandem with a Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and it has been demonstrated that both domains are required for the transforming activities of oncogenic members of the family. The DH domain typically represents the limit motif for binding the G protein and stimulating nucleotide exchange (3Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the PH domain appears to be essential for mediating the appropriate cellular localization of the protein (1Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 4Zheng Y. Zangrilli D. Cerione R.A. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19017-19020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Additionally, members of the Dbl family contain a number of other structural motifs that indicate a role in signal transduction. These domains presumably function to mediate protein/protein and protein/lipid interactions and serve to link members of the Dbl family to upstream regulation (2Whitehead I.P. Cambell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). This has been most carefully worked out for the Dbl family member, Vav, which is a Rac-GEF that is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation and by the phospholipids, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (5Crespo P.

White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Lfc contains a cysteine-rich domain similar to the diacylglycerol binding domain found in protein kinase C which may function to couple Lfc with upstream generation of lipids (1Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Determining the regulation and cellular localization of the growing family of Rho-GEFs will be important for understanding how Rho-related GTP-binding proteins mediate multiple cellular activities. Activated RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 regulate both gene transcription and the actin cytoskeleton, contributing to the control of cell morphology, motility, and growth (reviewed in Refs. 8Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar and 9Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). Through their interactions with multiple targets, the Rho family of GTP-binding proteins is able to coordinate these diverse cellular functions. A number of targets have been identified including two related families of serine/threonine kinases, the p21-activated kinases (Paks) and the mixed lineage kinases (MLKs), which have been shown to play specific roles in regulating gene transcription and the actin cytoskeleton (10Bagrodia S.

The JNK family members have also been referred to as stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) because of the ability of ultraviolet radiation, osmotic shock, or inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α to stimulate their activity (20Derijard B.

We have previously shown that Lfc, which functions specifically as a GEF for RhoA in vitro, binds tightly to Rac1 in a nucleotide-independent manner (22Glaven J.A. Whitehead I.P. Nomanbhoy T. Kay R. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27374-27381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Additionally, Lfc strongly activates JNK in COS-7 cells. These findings suggest that Lfc may have a broader specificity in cells that would include promoting a Rac1-mediated pathway which leads to JNK activation. This led us to examine the cellular activity of Lfc. Thus far, Vav, Tiam-1, and SOS (7Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mostellar R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D.

In the present studies, we show that Lfc is another Dbl family member that has a positive effect on Rac signaling. However, in this case, we do not detect a direct Lfc-stimulated activation of Rac1. Rather Lfc, through direct interactions with microtubules as mediated by its PH domain, may serve to mark the cellular site for a Rac-signaling complex that leads to JNK activation and/or actin cytoskeletal changes.

Primers for PCR encoded the restriction sites HindIII and XbaI to subclone the PH domain fragment into the Escherichia coli expression vector pGXKG. The PCR generated fragment encompassed the entire PH domain plus a small amount of flanking sequence (amino acid sequence 450–573). Generation of all constructs encoding Rac1, Cdc42, and their dominant negative mutants have been described previously (10Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

These were subcloned into the expression vector pCDNA3, which has been engineered to contain either the HA- or Myc-tag for expression in mammalian cells. The generation of J3mPak3 has been described (17Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Kinase-defective Pak3 was made by mutating Lys at position 297 in the ATP-binding site to Arg using the PCR overlap method. The pCMV6 Dbl was generated by ligating a BamHI fragment encoding oncogenic Dbl from plasmid pc11dbl (a gift from Dr. Sandra Eva, Institute Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy) into the BamHI site of pCMV6. cDNA encoding the GTPase defective and dominant negative mutants of Rho were a gift from Dr. C. Der (University of North Carolina) and were subcloned into pCDNA3, which contains the Myc-tag, for expression in mammalian cells. The Flag-tagged human JNK1 has been described previously (17Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Plasmids (pCDNA3) expressing MLK3 and MLK3(K114R) were gifts from Dr. J. S. Gutkind (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All PCR-generated products were sequenced to confirm that no errors were introduced. LipofectAMINE-mediated transient transfection of COS-7 cells and NIH 3T3 cells were carried out according to the manufacturer protocol (Life Technologies, Inc). After 5 h, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for COS-7 cells or calf serum for NIH 3T3 cells. For immune complex kinase assays, cells were lysed at 36–48 h after addition of DNA. For fluorescence studies, cells were trypsinized 24 h after the addition of DNA and replated onto chamber slides (LABTEK) for 24–36 h. Cells were serum starved for 2 h prior to lysis for kinase assays. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis. For immune complex kinase assays, lysates were normalized for the amount of kinase, Flag-JNK or Myc-Pak3. Flag-tagged JNK was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody M5 (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems) prebound to protein G-Sepharose. Myc-tagged Pak3 was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (10E-9, ATCC) prebound to protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and divided into two equal aliquots. One aliquot was subjected to Western blot analysis, and the second was used in the kinase assay. JNK kinase immunoprecipitates were washed twice in 10 mmMgCl2 and 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and incubated with 3 μg of GST-Jun substrate, 5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, and 20 μm ATP in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol (final volume = 30 μl) for 20 min at 22 °C. Pak3 kinase immunoprecipitates were washed twice in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 20 mm MgCl2 and mixed with 5 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma), 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, and 20 μm ATP in a final volume of 30 μl for 10 min at 22 °C. The kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA containing Laemmli sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The incorporation of 32P was visualized by autoradiography. The p21 (Cdc42/Rac1) binding domain (PBD) of Pak3 was expressed in E. coli as a GST fusion protein and immobilized by binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The immobilized GST-PBD was used to precipitate activated Rac1 from transfected COS-7 cell lysates. Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The expression of proteins was confirmed by Western blotting of an aliquot prior to affinity precipitation, and lysates used for affinity precipitation were normalized for HA-Rac1 levels. Affinity precipitations were carried out for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times in lysis buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. HA-tagged Rac1 was detected with monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Berkley Antibody Co). The primary antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse antibody using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For morphological studies, cells were serum starved for 16 h, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Actin cytoskeleton was stained by incubation with 3.3 μm Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 1 h followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline. For immunolocalization studies, cells were fixed and permeabilized as above. HA-D7 Lfc was detected using anti-HA11 IgG monoclonal antibody (Babco, Berkeley, CA) at 1:200 dilution for 1 h followed by Bodipy-conjugated anti-IgG-specific secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h. Microtubules were stained with anti-tubulin IgM monoclonal antibody (a gift from Dr. G. Bloom, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) for 1 h, followed by rhodamine-conjugated anti-IgM-specific secondary antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL) for 1 h. The secondary antibodies did not show nonspecific labeling, or cross-reactivity. Cells were observed and photographed under a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. The expression and purification of GST-DHPH Lfc (GST-D10 Lfc) from Sf21 insect cells has been previously described (22Glaven J.A. Whitehead I.P. Nomanbhoy T. Kay R. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27374-27381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The GST-PH fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and an overnight culture that was grown from a single colony was used to inoculate a 1-liter culture that was grown at 37 °C, while shaking, to anA 560 nm of 0.6 (∼4 h). Protein expression was then induced by the addition of 200 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 1 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at −80 °C. The pellets were thawed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Bacteria were lysed on ice by adding 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme followed by 10 mg/ml of DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) and 5 mm MgCl2. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 30,000 rpm. Proteins were purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography. The glutathione-agarose bound GST fusion proteins were used in affinity precipitations from Jurkat T-cell lysates (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Precipitations were carried out at 4 °C for 2 h and washed in cell lysis buffer three times, and then the resuspended samples were subjected to Western blot analysis. Precipitated tubulin was detected with monoclonal anti-tubulin primary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the primary antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse antibody using the chemiluminescence detection reagent ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). It has been reported previously that both Rac1 and Cdc42 can activate the JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in COS-7 cells, whereas RhoA does not (16Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Termoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). We have observed that the overexpression of Lfc in COS-7 cells leads to JNK activation. In Fig.1, we show a schematic representation of full-length Lfc and Lsc, and the different forms of the recombinant proteins used in this study. Using an in vitro kinase assay to determine the activity of immunoprecipitated Flag-tagged JNK from lysates, we find that Lfc and Dbl can activate JNK in COS-7 cells to an extent similar to the activation induced by exposing cells to ultraviolet radiation, whereas Lsc shows no detectable stimulation (Fig. 2 A). The Lfc-mediated stimulation of JNK activity was not dependent on the diacylglycerol binding domain since the D6-Lfc and D7-Lfc constructs both yielded strong JNK activation (Fig. 2 B). The lack of stimulation by Lsc indicates that although RhoA can activate JNK in some cell types, as reported by Teramoto et al. (25Terramoto H. Crespo P. Coso O.A. Igishi T. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25731-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), it does not activate JNK in COS-7 cells. Thus, we set out to determine whether Rac1 mediates the Lfc-stimulated activation of JNK in COS-7 cells.Figure 2Activation of JNK by Lfc in vivo. A, COS-7 cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmid pcDNA3-Flag-JNK (0.4 μg) together with an empty expression vector or with an expression vector encoding HA-D7 Lfc, HA-D7 Lsc, or Dbl (1 μg). Cells were lysed at 36–48 h post-transfection, and JNK activity was measured by immune complex kinase assays using [γ-32P]ATP and c-Jun as substrates. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography to show phosphorylation of substrate (top panel) and Western blot analysis to show relative amounts of Flag-JNK in the kinase reactions (bottom panel).

Based on in vitro binding studies, which indicated that Lfc could form stable complexes with both RhoA and Rac1, we would anticipate that dominant negative versions of RhoA (RhoA(T19N)) and Rac1 (Rac(S17N)) would be capable of binding Lfc and inhibiting its activation of JNK. As shown in Fig. 3, Rac(S17N) blocked Lfc-stimulated JNK activity, whereas comparable levels of RhoA(T19N) showed a significantly weaker inhibition. At higher levels of expression, RhoA(T19N) was then able to provide an inhibitory effect. Dominant negative Cdc42 (Cdc42(T17N)) was not able to inhibit Lfc-stimulated JNK activity under any condition. The Paks, which serve as targets for Cdc42 and Rac but not RhoA, have been shown to mediate the activation of JNK in certain cell types (10Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A.

Thus, we examined whether a kinase-defective mutant of Pak3 (Pak3(K297R)), by interfering with Rac1-stimulated signaling, would inhibit Lfc-mediated JNK activation. Fig. 4 A (where KDP represents the Pak3 mutant) shows that this was the case. However, it was interesting that we did not find that Lfc stimulated Pak3 activity in these cells. We examined this by transiently co-expressing Myc-tagged Pak3 with either Lfc, Lsc, or Dbl in COS-7 cells. These studies showed that Lfc did not activate Pak3, under conditions where Dbl stimulated Pak3 activity (Fig. 4 B). This suggests that the direct stimulation of Rac (and Pak3) activity by Lfc is not the underlying mechanism by which Lfc mediates JNK activation (also, see below). MLK3 is another putative protein kinase target for Cdc42 and Rac that has recently been shown to be a strong activator of JNK (15Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that like the kinase-defective Pak3, a kinase-defective form of MLK3 (MLK3(K114R)) (Fig. 5, designated KDMLK), inhibits Lfc-stimulated JNK activity. Thus far, we have not been able to determine whether Lfc stimulates MLK3 activity because this protein kinase is constitutively active when expressed in cells, and so it has not been possible to conclude whether MLK is an essential participant in the Lfc-mediated signaling pathway leading to JNK activation.Figure 5Dominant negative mutant of MLK3 blocks Lfc-stimulated JNK activity. COS-7 cells were transiently co-transfected with Flag-JNK (0.4 μg) together with an empty expression (−) vector or with an expression vector encoding HA-D7 Lfc (+) (1 μg) and 2 μg of MLK3 K114R (KDMLK, kinase dead) or 2 μg of MLK3 (WTMLK, wild type). Cells were lysed at 36–48 h post-transfection, and JNK activity was measured by immune complex kinase assays using [γ-32P]ATP and c-Jun as substrates.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27374-27381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), suggesting that Lfc did not act as a GEF for Rac1. However, similar in vitro results have been obtained for Vav, Tiam-1, and Sos, but it was subsequently shown that cellular co-factors were necessary to enable each of these Dbl-related molecules to act as GEFs for Rac1 in cells (7Han J.

Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Thus, we took advantage of a recently developed assay for Rac activation (26Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordan A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) to determine whether Lfc could increase the levels of GTP-bound Rac1 in cells. Specifically, the p21-binding domain (PBD) of Pak3 was expressed as a GST-fusion protein and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and then was used as an affinity reagent to precipitate GTP-bound (activated) HA-Rac1 from transfected COS-7 cell lysates. As shown in Fig.6, when using this assay, we were unable to detect an increase in the levels of GTP-bound Rac1 in cells that were co-transfected with Lfc and HA-Rac1. However, we were able to detect an increase in GTP-bound Rac1 when Dbl was co-expressed with HA-Rac1, consistent with prior results indicating that Dbl can stimulate the activation of Rac in cells (26Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordan A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Rearrangements in the actin cytoskeleton have been shown to be regulated by members of the Rho subfamily of GTP-binding proteins (reviewed in Ref. 9Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that each of the Rho family members induces distinct morphological phenotypes. By taking advantage of these morphological changes, we set out to determine whether Lfc promotes a Rac1-like morphology. Cells were stained with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) to visualize the actin cytoskeleton in NIH 3T3 cells co-transfected with an expression vector encoding HA-D7 Lfc or HA-D7 Lsc and pEGFP (an expression vector containing green fluorescent protein) (Fig.7). Similar types of experiments were performed using indirect immunofluorescence with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (HA11, Babco) to identify cells expressing HA-D7 Lfc or HA-D7 Lsc. We also examined the actin rearrangements induced by transient expression of GTPase-defective RhoA (RhoA(G14V)) and Rac1 (Rac(Q61L)). As shown in Fig. 7, cells expressing the GTPase-defective RhoA mutant have enhanced actin stress fibers (Fig. 7 C) as compared with control NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 7 A). NIH 3T3 cells expressing GTPase-defective Rac1 (Fig. 7 B) have an enhanced actin meshwork at their periphery, resulting in membrane ruffles. We show in Fig. 7 E that Lsc strongly induces actin stress fibers and a morphology similar to that observed when over-expressing the activated RhoA mutant. Lfc, however, appears to not only promote the formation of actin stress fibers but also induces lamellipodia and membrane ruffling, indicative of signaling through both activated RhoA and Rac1 (Fig. 7 D). We used HA-D7 Lfc in immunofluorescence experiments to examine the cellular localization of Lfc. Using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (HA11, Babco) as the primary antibody, and Bodipy-labeled secondary antibody, we detected a distinct cellular distribution for Lfc, as reflected by a filamentous pattern (data not shown). This pattern of staining closely resembled the microtubule network. We next double stained cells expressing HA-D7 Lfc to directly examine whether Lfc co-localized with microtubules. HA-D7 Lfc was detected as described above, and microtubules were detected using an anti-tubulin antibody followed by rhodamine-labeled secondary antibody. The results of this indirect immunofluorescent staining clearly demonstrate that Lfc (Fig.8 A) colocalizes with the microtubule network (Fig. 8 B). A localization to microtubules has also been reported for Rac1 (27Best A. Ahmed S. Kozma R. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3756-3762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and more recently for MLK and JNK (28Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The GST-D10 Lfc, which contains just the DH-PH domains of Lfc, was used as an affinity reagent to identify potential binding partners. Fig. 9 B(lane 3) shows that a 55-kDa protein co-precipitates with the GST-Lfc construct. The 55-kDa protein, which can be photo-labeled with [α-32P]GTP (data not shown), was identified as tubulin, based on Western blot analysis. To further characterize this interaction, we made a GST fusion construct containing just the PH domain of Lfc (Fig. 9 A). When the GST-Lfc (PH) fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and used as an affinity reagent, it was able to bind tubulin in an essentially identical manner as we originally observed with the DH/PH domain construct (Fig.9 B, fourth lane). The GST-Dbl (PH) domain was unable to bind tubulin under the same experimental conditions (data not shown). Taken together, these findings identify tubulin as a putative binding partner for the PH domain of Lfc and suggest that it is the PH domain that is responsible for the co-localization of Lfc with microtubules in cells. Lfc serves as a potent nucleotide exchange factor for RhoA in vitro and is able to induce actin stress fibers when overexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells. However, the fact that we have shown that Lfc forms a tight binding complex with Rac1 in vitro, together with the observation that Lfc stimulates JNK in COS-7 cells, led us to examine whether Lfc promotes or stabilizes the activated form of Rac1 in cells. The activation of JNK by Vav, Ost, and Dbl have all been shown to be mediated by Rac1, such that the dominant negative Rac1(S17N) mutant blocks their ability to activate JNK (16Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Termoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar,29Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. Aaronson D.S. Coso O.A. Lopez-Barahona M. Barbacid M. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 455-460PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented here indicate that Rac1 also mediates the activation of JNK by Lfc in COS-7 cells. Lfc-stimulated JNK activity was inhibited by expression of the dominant negative form of Rac1, but not by dominant negative Cdc42. Dominant negative mutants of Pak3 and MLK3, two targets of Rac1, also inhibited Lfc-stimulated JNK activity."
https://openalex.org/W2161708108,"The <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> open reading frame <i>YNL231C</i> was recently found to be controlled by the multiple drug resistance regulator Pdr1p. Here we characterize<i>YNL231C</i> (<i>PDR16</i>) and its homologue<i>YNL264C</i> (<i>PDR17</i>). Deletion of <i>PDR16</i>resulted in hypersensitivity of yeast to azole inhibitors of ergosterol biosynthesis. While no increase in drug sensitivity was found upon deletion of <i>PDR17</i> alone, a <i>Δpdr16,Δpdr17</i>double mutant was hypersensitive to a broad range of drugs. Both mutations caused significant changes of the lipid composition of plasma membrane and total cell extracts. Deletion of <i>PDR16</i> had pronounced effects on the sterol composition, whereas <i>PDR17</i>deletion mainly affected the phospholipid composition. Thus, Pdr16p and Pdr17p may regulate yeast lipid synthesis like their distant homologue, Sec14p. The azole sensitivity of the <i>PDR16-</i>deleted strain may be the result of imbalanced ergosterol synthesis. Impaired plasma membrane barrier function resulting from a change in the lipid composition appears to cause the increased drug sensitivity of the double mutant strain <i>Δpdr16,Δpdr17</i>. The uptake rate of rhodamine-6-G into de-energized cells was shown to be almost 2-fold increased in a <i>Δpdr16,Δpdr17</i> strain as compared with wild-type and <i>Δpdr5</i> strains. Collectively, our results indicate that <i>PDR16</i> and <i>PDR17</i> control levels of various lipids in various compartments of the cell and thereby provide a mechanism for multidrug resistance unrecognized so far."

Fyn was observed to be constitutively associated with Cbl in lysates of several different cell types including the interleukin-3-dependent murine myeloid cell line 32Dcl3, and the prolactin-dependent rat thymoma cell line Nb2. Binding studies indicated that Cbl could bind to glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins encoding the unique, Src homology domain 3 (SH3), and SH2 domains of Fyn, Hck, or Lyn. Fusion proteins encoding either the SH3 or SH2 domains of Fyn bound to Cbl as effectively as the fusion protein encoding the unique, SH3, and SH2 domains of Fyn. The Fyn SH2 domain bound to both tyrosine-phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated Cbl, implying that this interaction might be phosphotyrosine-independent. Binding of the Fyn SH2 domain to Cbl was not disrupted by the addition of phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, or phosphothreonine. A GST fusion protein encoding the proline-rich region of Cbl bound to Fyn present in a total cell lysate. Far Western blot analysis also indicated that the SH3 domain of Fyn bound preferentially to the proline-rich region of Cbl. The addition of [γ-32P]ATP to either anti-Cbl immunoprecipitates or anti-Fyn immunoprecipitates resulted in the phosphorylation of both Cbl and Fyn as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of the phosphorylated proteins with specific antisera. Fyn directly phosphorylated a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal region of Cbl (GST-CBL-LZIP). In contrast, immunoprecipitated JAK2 was not able to phosphorylate this same region of Cbl. The GST-CBL-LZIP fusion protein contains a binding site for the SH2 domain of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which mapped to Tyr731, which is present in the sequence YEAM. Mutation of Tyr731 in GST-CBL-LZIP eliminated binding of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and substantially reduced the phosphorylation of this fusion protein by Fyn, despite the presence of four other tyrosine residues in this fusion protein. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that Cbl represents a substrate for Src-like kinases that are activated in response to the engagement of cell surface receptors, and that Src-like kinases are responsible for the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue in Cbl that may regulate activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. We have investigated the interaction between Cbl and the Src-related tyrosine kinase Fyn. Fyn was observed to be constitutively associated with Cbl in lysates of several different cell types including the interleukin-3-dependent murine myeloid cell line 32Dcl3, and the prolactin-dependent rat thymoma cell line Nb2. Binding studies indicated that Cbl could bind to glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins encoding the unique, Src homology domain 3 (SH3), and SH2 domains of Fyn, Hck, or Lyn.

Adapter proteins play a critical role in the regulation and activation of signaling molecules that lie downstream of various cell surface receptors. Small adapter molecules (such as Shc, Grb2, Nck, and Crk) have been extensively studied primarily because their simple structure has allowed detailed analysis of their functions and identification of the proteins with which they interact. This has led to the important observation that both Grb2 and Shc play a critical role in the activation of the GTP exchange factor son of sevenless which in turn regulates the activation of Ras (1Rozakis-Adcock M.

These proteins are all relatively large in size, and contain numerous tyrosine residues, which could serve as binding sites for multiple SH2-containing signaling molecules. Although the precise role for these larger adapter molecules in signaling processes is not known, it is clear that some of these large adapter proteins (IRS-1 and Cbl) can interact with signaling molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (16Parrizas M.

Cytokines such as PRL and IL-3 result in the activation of one or more members of the Janus family of tyrosine kinases (43Rui H. Kirken R.A. Farrar W.L. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 674-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Torigoe T. O'Connor R. Santoli D. Reed J.C. Blood. 1992; 80: 617-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Anderson S.M. Jorgensen B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1660-1670PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, either Janus or Src-like kinases could be responsible for the phosphorylation of Cbl following the activation of cytokine receptors. In this study we show that Fyn is constitutively associated with Cbl in PRL-responsive cells, and that Fyn, but not JAK2, can phosphorylate a fusion protein that contains the region of Cbl to which the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase appears to bind. This suggests that Src-like kinases phosphorylate Cbl and thereby regulate the activation of PI 3-kinase.DISCUSSIONOne of the critical issues regarding signal transduction by cytokine receptors is the role of different tyrosine kinases in mitogenic signaling. The binding of ligands to cytokine receptor family members has been reported to activate one or more members of the Janus family of tyrosine kinases, and one or more members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. Studies with mutant cell lines that are resistant to interferon have demonstrated that activation of Janus kinases is critical in mediating the activation of STAT molecules and the induction of interferon-induced transcription (64Watling D. Guschin D. Muller M. Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Rogers N.C. Schindler C. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 65Muller M.

In cells stimulated to proliferate by cytokines, such as IL-3 and PRL, it is clear that one or more members of the Janus family of kinases is activated, which leads to the activation of one or more STAT family members (43Rui H.

Although it is clear that the activation of JAK2 is required for the transcription of specialized gene products, such as induction of β-casein by PRL (70Gao J. Hughes J.P. Auperin B. Buteau H. Edery M. Zhuang H. Wojchowski D.M. Horseman N.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 847-856PubMed Google Scholar), there is no evidence that activation of JAK2 and STAT molecules are required for mitogenesis. It has been our general hypothesis that the activation of Src-like kinases is critical in the activation of mitogenic signaling cascades that lie downstream of cytokine receptors.In this study we have described the interaction between the Src-like kinase Fyn and the adapter protein Cbl. Our data indicate that Fyn and Cbl are constitutively associated in two different cell lines derived from two different tissues (myeloid and T-cell) from two different species (mouse and rat, respectively). Similar data have also been obtained in the human breast cancer cell line T47D (data not shown). There was no evidence that JAK2 was associated with Cbl in any of these cell lines. Binding studies indicated that the SH3 and SH2 domains of Fyn are able to bind to Cbl and that both domains can apparently interact in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner.Other investigators have demonstrated that Src-like kinases are able to bind to Cbl and that these interactions are mediated by the SH3 domain, the SH2 domain, or both (26Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Trub T. Soltoff S. Panchamoorthy G. Druker B. Cantley L. Shoelson S.E. Band H. J. Biol.

It is logical that the SH3 domain of Fyn could bind to Cbl in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner, since SH3 domains recognize proline-rich sequences, and there are several proline-rich regions in Cbl. The direct binding of the Fyn SH3 domain to the proline-rich region of Cbl, as demonstrated by far Western blot analysis, is consistent with this expectation. We were, however, surprised to observe the constitutive, phosphotyrosine-independent binding of the Fyn SH2 domain to Cbl. Although other investigators have reported the ability of the Abl and Lck SH2 domain to bind to proteins that do not contain phosphotyrosine (71Raffe G.D. Parmar K. Rosenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4640-4645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 72Joung I. Strominger J.L. Shin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1995; 92: 12338-12342Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), there have been suggestions that this could be explained by the ability of these SH2 domains to recognize peptides containing either phosphoserine or phosphothreonine (74Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Maru Y. Witte O. Cell. 1991; 66: 161-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The inability of free phosphoserine or phosphothreonine to block the binding of the Fyn SH2 domain to Cbl suggests that it may be able to recognize other motifs as well. The ability of the Fyn SH2 domain to bind to Cbl in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner is consistent with our previously reported results (18Anderson S.M. Burton E.A. Koch B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 739-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).We have also previously reported that although the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase is constitutively associated with Cbl in both 32Dcl3 and Nb2 cells, and that stimulation with either IL-3 or PRL results in a cytokine-induced increase in Cbl-associated PI kinase activity (18Anderson S.M. Burton E.A. Koch B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 739-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,19Hunter S. Koch B.L. Anderson S.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1213-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This has suggested to us that Cbl may function as an adapter or scaffold molecule that could link cytokine receptors to the activation of PI 3-kinase. Although it would be expected that the SH3 domain of p85 could bind to the proline-rich region of Cbl, we could not detect this interaction when the ability of GST-PRO to bind to p85 was examined by immunoblotting with anti-p85 antiserum (Fig. 7). It has been suggested by other investigators that the SH3 domain of p85 could be bound in an intramolecular fashion to one of two proline-rich sequences in the p85 subunit (75Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar), and thus the SH3 domain of p85 may not be able to bind to other molecules. The major binding site for p85 in Cbl appears to be Tyr731 (Fig. 7), which is present in the sequence pYEAM, and would be expected to represent a binding site for the SH2 domains of p85 (53Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). The association of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the p110 subunit is thought to suppress the kinase activity of the catalytic p110 subunit (76Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of the p85 subunit to a phosphopeptide results in the activation of the catalytic subunit (76Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it would be expected that the binding of the C-terminal SH2 domain of p85 to phosphorylated Tyr731 might be expected to lead to the catalytic activation of the enzyme.In this study, we have also demonstrated that Fyn was able to phosphorylate the Cbl protein with which it co-precipitated. In addition, we have demonstrated that Fyn was able to phosphorylate a GST fusion protein that encoded a region of Cbl that contained five tyrosine residues, including Tyr731. Mutation of Tyr731 to a Phe resulted in a substantial reduction in phosphorylation of this protein. This latter result suggests that Tyr731 is a preferred phosphorylation site for Src-like kinases. We were unable to demonstrate that JAK2 could phosphorylate the same GST-LZIP fusion protein that contained Tyr731. These data suggest that the phosphorylation of at least one critical tyrosine residue in Cbl, Tyr731, is mediated by Src-like kinases and not by JAK2. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of Cbl at this site represents one means by which the activation of PI 3-kinase may be regulated."

The RGD peptide motif is recognized by many integrins including αvβ6, a specific receptor for fibronectin thought to support epithelial cell proliferation during wound healing and carcinoma progression. We report here the discovery of an unexpected non-RGD recognition motif for integrin αvβ6. We compared the recognition profiles of recombinant αvβ6 and αvβ3 integrins by using phage display screening employing 7-mer and 12-mer peptide libraries. As predicted, phages binding strongly to αvβ3 contained ubiquitous RGD sequences. However, on αvβ6, in addition to RGD- containing phages, one-quarter of the population from the 12-mer library contained the distinctive consensus motif DLXXL. A synthetic DLXXL peptide, RTDLDSLRTYTL, selected from the phage sequences (clone-1) was a selective inhibitor of RGD-dependent ligand binding to αvβ6 in isolated receptor assays (IC50 = 20 nm), and in cell adhesion assays (IC50 = 50 μm). DLXXL peptides were highly specific inhibitors of αvβ6-fibronectin interaction as synthetic scrambled or reversed DLXXL peptides were inactive. NH2- and COOH-terminal modifications of the flanking amino acids suggested that the preceding two and a single trailing amino acid were also involved in interaction with αvβ6. The DLXXL sequence is present in several matrix components and in the β chain of many integrins. Although there is as yet no precise biological role known for DLXXL, it is clearly a specific inhibitory sequence for integrin αvβ6 which has been unrecognized previously.

Integrins are a family of heterodimeric class I transmembrane receptors involved in numerous cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion phenomena (1Tuckwell D.S. Weston S.A. Humphries M.J. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1993; 47: 107-136PubMed Google Scholar). They can be grouped roughly into three classes: the β1 series, which are ubiquitous receptors for extracellular matrix (2Ruoslahti E. Noble N.A. Kagami S. Border W.A. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1994; 44: S17-S22PubMed Google Scholar); the β2 series, which are activatable on leukocytes and are triggered during the inflammatory response (3Gahmberg C.G. Tolvanen M. Kotovuori P. Eur. J.

Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Soluble RGD-containing peptides can inhibit the interaction of each of these integrins with fibronectin. However, to analyze the function of individual fibronectin receptors in a particular cellular environment it is useful to have more specific inhibitors, and a variety of inhibitory antibodies, modified peptides, and non-peptidic substances has been developed. However, as yet no inhibitor has been discovered specific for αvβ6. αvβ6 is a rare integrin, induced during repair processes in epithelia (10Busk M. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Biol.

Accordingly, both constrained cyclic and linear peptide libraries have been used to discover novel peptides that interact with integrins (19O'Neil K.T. Hoess R.H. Jackson S.A. Ramachandran N.S.

But, with few exceptions, these peptides contain RGD sequences, whereas the non-RGD sequences found have only bound weakly. Here we have used recombinant αvβ6 expressed as a transmembrane truncated soluble receptor to screen phage libraries displaying peptides of 7 or 12 amino acids. This revealed a strong and previously unpredicted recognition motif for αvβ6 integrin which we describe here. Similar motifs are displayed in several extracellular matrix molecules.

Human integrins were extracted from native sources (αvβ5, αIIbβ3) or expressed as recombinant soluble receptors using the baculovirus expression system (αvβ3, αvβ6). αIIbβ3 was prepared from outdated human platelet concentrates (6Pytela R.

The column was eluted with the GRGDSPK, the peak containing αIIbβ3 was concentrated ∼5-fold, dialyzed, and stored at −80 °C. αvβ5 was purified from human placenta (29Smith J.W. Vestal D.J. Irwin S.V.

The eluant was neutralized with 3 m Tris, pH 8.8, dialyzed against buffer C, and concentrated ∼10× using Aquacide II (Calbiochem).

In brief, the transfer vector pAcUW31 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) allowed simultaneous expression of two different target cDNAs and was used to make recombinant baculovirus-expressing transmembrane truncated αvβ6. The preparation of truncated αv transfer vectors was as described (28Mehta R.J. Diefenbach B. Brown A. Cullen E. Jonczyk A. Güssow D. Luckenbach G.A. Goodman S.L. Biochem.

The recombinant baculoviruses were used to infect High Five insect cells, and the soluble receptor was harvested from the culture supernatant at 48–72 h of culture by passing the supernatant over 14D9.F8 antibody affinity columns, washing, and eluting at pH 3.1. All processes were carried out at room temperature and in the absence of detergents. Peak fractions were neutralized, concentrated, and dialyzed at 4 °C before shock freezing and storage at −80 °C. The recombinant soluble human receptor (αvβ6-ΔTM) is biologically active and retains ligand specificity (13Weinacker A. Chen A. Agrez M. Cone R.I. Nishimura S. Wayner E. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J.

The integrin αvβ3-ΔTM, αvβ5, and αvβ6-ΔTM preparations were ∼95% pure as judged by anti-integrin ELISA2 using α and β chain-specific monoclonal antibodies (data not shown) and by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis against molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad). Peptides were synthesized, purified, and analyzed in-house as described (30Haubner R. Gratias R. Diefenbach B. Goodman S.L. Jonczyk A. Kessler H. J. Am. Chem.

Purification was done by reversed phase HPLC and analysis by HPLC and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The peptide EMD 66203, cyclic(Arg-Gly-Asp-(d-Phe)-Val), is abbreviated as c(RGDfV). 17E6 and 14D9.F8 (anti-αv), LM609 (anti-αvβ3), P4C10 (anti-β1), and P1F6 (anti-αvβ5) all inhibit cell adhesion mediated by their respective integrins and have been described in detail elsewhere (27Mitjans F.

M13 phage display libraries displaying linear peptides of 7 or 12 amino acids (PHD system from New England Biolabs) were used to select integrin-binding phages. Panning was performed as described in the product manual with the following modifications. Integrins were diluted to 1.5 μg/ml in TBS++ (1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.01 mm MnCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) and adsorbed onto Petri dishes for 16 h at 4 °C. After blocking for 2 h with 0.5% BSA in TBS++, aliquots of the phage display libraries (1011 plaque-forming units) were diluted in TBS++ containing 0.1% Tween 20, and phages were allowed to bind for 1 h at 30 °C. Unbound phages were removed by washing with TBS++ containing 0.3% Tween 20, and bound phages were eluted with 0.1m glycine, pH 2.2, and amplified in Escherichia coli XL-1. Phages were prepared from the culture supernatant by standard polyethylene glycol/NaCl precipitation and used for the next round of panning. After the third round of panning randomly selected phage plaques were amplified, and single-stranded DNA was sequenced using the Amplitaq FS sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) with the primer 96gIII (New England Biolabs). Integrins were adsorbed onto 96-well plates as described above for the Petri dishes. Phages amplified from single plaques and purified by polyethylene glycol/NaCl precipitation were serially diluted in TBS++ containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA and allowed to bind to integrins for 1 h. After washing, bound phages were detected with an anti-M13 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 3,3′,5,5′- tetramethylbenzidine substrate. The adsorption of the integrins to the plates was investigated using indirect ELISA. Integrins were immobilized by adsorption on 96-well plates, and the plates were blocked with BSA as described under “Selection of Integrin-binding Phages” (above). 17E6 antibody, specific for the αv chain of all αv integrins (27Mitjans F. Sander D. Adan J. Sutter A. Martinez J.M. Jaggle C.S. Moyano J.M. Kreysch H.G. Piulats J. Goodman S.L. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2825-2838PubMed Google Scholar), was biotinylated (28Mehta R.J.

Integrin-ligand competition assays were performed as described (30Haubner R. Gratias R. Diefenbach B. Goodman S.L. Jonczyk A. Kessler H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7461-7472Crossref Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Integrins were immobilized as described under “Selection of Integrin-binding Phages” (above). Serially diluted peptides in TBS++ containing 0.1% BSA were added in parallel with biotinylated fibronectin, vitronectin, or fibrinogen (to 1 μg/ml). After a 3-h incubation at 37 °C and washing with TBS++, bound ligand was detected by incubation with an anti-biotin alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Bio-Rad) followed by development with a p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate. The reaction was stopped by the addition of NaOH and the color intensity read at 405 nm. The optimal time course for the integrin-ligand interaction was determined in preliminary experiments. αvβ6-ΔTM was biotinylated as described previously for matrix proteins and antibodies (28Mehta R.J.

Fibronectin was diluted (to 5 μg/ml) in TBS++ and immobilized by adsorption to 96-well plates for 16 h at 4 °C as described under “Selection of Integrin-binding Phages” (above). After blocking for 2 h with 0.5% BSA in TBS++ (BTBS++) and washing in TBS, biotinylated integrin (3 μg/ml in BTBS++) was added in the presence of peptides serially diluted in the same buffer. After incubation (3 h, 37 °C) and washing with TBS++, bound integrin was detected by incubation with anti-biotin alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody and color development as described above. Cell culture of lines M21-L and HT-29, and their use in cell attachment assays, has been described in detail elsewhere (27Mitjans F. Sander D. Adan J. Sutter A. Martinez J.M. Jaggle C.S. Moyano J.M.

Chem. 1987; 262: 17703-17711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which uses only α5β1 to attach to fibronectin. HT-29 is a human carcinoma cell line that uses only αvβ6 integrin to attach to fibronectin (33Kemperman H. Wijnands Y.M. Roos E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The integrin profile of the cells was monitored routinely by fluorescence-activated cell sorter and showed the expected lack of αv integrins on M21-L and the lack of α5β1 and αvβ3 on HT-29 (see also Fig. 6). 96-well plates were coated with fibronectin (12.5 μg/ml) and blocked with BSA. Serially diluted peptides or antibodies were added followed by cells (2.5 × 104 cells/well). After 1.5 h at 37 °C nonadherent cells were washed away and attached cells detected using an assay measuring cellular hexosaminidase activity (31Goodman S.L. Deutzmann R. von der Mark K. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recombinant soluble human integrins αvβ3 and αvβ6 and native placental αvβ5 and platelet αIIbβ3 were purified by antibody or ligand affinity chromatography. On SDS gels each preparation showed the two major bands corresponding to the α and the β chains (Fig. 1 A). The chains migrated at the molecular mass predicted for the intact and transmembrane truncated recombinant chains (αv full-length, 150 kDa; αv-ΔTM, 125 kDa; αIIb full-length, 145 kDa; β3 full-length, 105 kDa; β5 full-length, 100 kDa; β3-ΔTM, 85 kDa; β6-ΔTM, 90 kDa). Each integrin was biologically active and showed ligand binding and divalent cation requirements predicted from the literature and also as demonstrated independently by us (13Weinacker A. Chen A.

Recombinant αvβ6 expressed as a transmembrane truncated soluble receptor bound two distinct classes of phages in phage display panning experiments from a linear 12-mer library as determined from the sequences of more than 100 clones: those containing RGD sequences (51%) and those containing anXXDLXXLX motif (27%). Some phages contained RGD and also continued with the motif as RGDLXXL (9%), whereas others displayed the sequence RGDL (38%); the remaining phages that were bound often contained DLXXL-related sequences.

Open table in a new tab Representative displayed peptide sequences from clones isolated by low pH elution from recombinant αvβ6 and αvβ3. Sequences have been selected to approximate the distribution of features found. RGD sequences have been underlined and DLXXL sequences highlighted bold and underlined. In the non-RGD sequences, the amino acid distribution at XwithinX 1 X 2DLX 3 X 4LX 5appeared nonrandom. Arg was favored at X 1 andX 5, Thr/Ser/Asp/Gly atX 2 , whereas atX 3 X 4 Ser/Thr were often paired with a charged amino acid. These characteristics were typified by a dominant clone with the sequence RTDLDSLRTYTL (clone-1). Non-RGD, DLXXL-containing peptides were represented in only 5% of clones isolated from a 7-mer phage display library, suggesting that sequences COOH-terminal to DLXXL are also involved in integrin binding (Table I). Indeed, the sequence COOH-terminal to the peptide insertion site in the phage pIII protein continues Gly-Gly-Gly (i.e. the 7-mer library inserts would readXXDLXXLGGG), and related sequences were not isolated from the 12-mer library. Pro atX 3 X 4 was never found in a DLXXL motif, and it was similarly excluded from the 4 amino acids COOH-terminal of the DLXXL sequence, although not from these positions in RGD-containing sequences. One sequence was found where the motif was concatenated as GDLDLLKLRLTR. To investigate whether the presence of DLXXL sequences was a library artifact, we also screened on αvβ3. Here mainly RGD-containing phages were bound, the DLXXL sequence was absent, and RGDL was present in fewer than 10% of clones. This distribution was distinct from that of the αvβ6 phage display library screen (TableI) and similar to that reported for linear 15-mer library screens (23Healy J.M. Murayama O. Maeda T. Yoshino K. Sekiguchi K. Kikuchi M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3948-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To eliminate the possibility that the differences in phage interactions seen between αvβ3 and αvβ6 were artifacts caused by differential adsorption of integrins during the phage screen, we estimated the amounts of each integrin adsorbed to the screening plates under the conditions of the screen using an indirect ELISA technique (Fig. 1 B). The ELISA titration curves derived using the 17E6 antibody, which recognizes the αv chain, were similar in form, in saturation level of antibody binding, and in the amount of antibody needed to titrate 50% of the receptors. This indicated that similar amounts of the αv integrins were adsorbed to the plates. To test the specificity of interaction of phage clones we used a quantitative ELISA to measure the binding of representative phages from the αvβ6 screen to immobilized purified integrins (Fig.2). DLXXL-containing phages bound only to αvβ6, whereas RGD phages bound both αvβ6 and αvβ3 and weakly to αvβ5 and to αIIbβ3. This indicated that the XXDLXXLX clones isolated in the screen were specific for αvβ6. RGD-containing peptides inhibit the interaction of RGD-containing ligands with their integrin receptors.

The PI domain of human X11L interacts with a sequence containing the NPXY motif found in the cytoplasmic domain of Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein. A construct lacking the carboxyl-terminal domain, which comprises two PDZ domains (N + PI), enhances PI binding to APP, whereas another construct lacking an amino-terminal domain relative to PI domain (PI + C) suppresses PI binding to APP. Overexpression of full-length human X11L (N + PI + C) in cells that express APP695 stably decreased the secretion of Aβ40 but not that of Aβ42. However, overexpression of the PI domain alone and the N + PI construct in cells did not affect the secretion of Aβ despite their ability to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein. These observations suggest that the amino-terminal domain regulates PI binding to APP and that the carboxyl-terminal domain containing PDZ motifs is essential to modulate APP processing. Because expression of the human X11L gene is specific to brain, the present observations should contribute to shedding light on the molecular mechanism of APP processing in Alzheimer's disease.

Because APP is a candidate pathogenic factor of AD, elucidation of the physiological function of APP as well as the determination of the metabolic mechanism of Aβ production should increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of AD. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated cDNA of proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of APP (APPCOOH) in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of APP metabolism and function of APP. Previous efforts to identify and isolate proteins associating with APPCOOH, utilizing the yeast two-hybrid system, have resulted in the isolation of proteins carrying phosphotyrosine binding/phosphotyrosine interaction (PI) domains such as Fe65 (17Fiore F. Zambrano N. Minopoli G. Donini V. Duilio A. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30853-30856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), Fe65-like (18Guénette S.Y. Chen J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar).The X11 gene, which is located on chromosome 9, was originally isolated as a gene candidate for Friedreich ataxia (21Duclos F. Boschert U. Sirugo G. Mandel J.-L. Hen R. Koenig M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and its partial cDNA was identified as a clone encoding a protein that associates with APPCOOH (22McLoughlin D.M. Miller C.C.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The PI domain of X11 interacts with the YENPTY motif of APPCOOH (20Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In the present study, we isolated a complete cDNA encoding an X11-like protein (X11L) from a human adult brain cDNA library, utilizing the yeast two-hybrid system and APPCOOH as a bait. A partial short cDNA encoding approximately 190 amino acids in the PI domain of X11L has already been isolated using a similar procedure (22McLoughlin D.M. Miller C.C.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, detailed characterization of X11L binding to APP and identification of the role X11L plays in the physiological function of APP have not been performed. We found that human X11L requires a sequence containing the NPXY motif of APPCOOHfor APP binding and that association of the PI domain with APP was suppressed by a deletion of a amino-terminal domain fused to the PI domain (PI + C construct) but enhanced by a deletion of a carboxyl-terminal domain fused to the PI domain (N + PI construct). Co-transfection of full-length human X11L into cells that express stably transfected human APP695 cDNA resulted in decreased secretion of Aβ40 but not Aβ42. However, co-transfection into cells of the cDNA lacking the carboxyl-terminal domain (N + PI construct) or a cDNA encoding only the PI domain (PI construct), whose protein products preserve the ability to bind to APPCOOH, did not present the ability to modulate Aβ production. The present results suggest that the amino-terminal region of the PI domain is needed to regulate binding affinity to APPCOOH and that the carboxyl-terminal region of the PI domain is essential for modulation of APP metabolism. Furthermore, Northern blot and Western blot analyses demonstrated strong specific expression of the X11L gene in brain tissues. Together with the present results, this suggests that X11L may play an important role in the physiological function and metabolism of APP in neuronal tissues.DISCUSSIONAPP was identified as a causative factor in the pathogenesis of AD (1Kang J.

Several mutations of APP and other AD-related genes have been found in familial AD, and it has been reported that these mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of familial AD (reviewed in Refs. 36Selkoe D.J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1994; 53: 438-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar and 37Haass C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 687-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, familial AD represents only a small minority of AD cases. The majority of AD cases are of the sporadic type, whose patients are not thought to carry the mutation. Therefore, elucidation of the physiological function(s) and metabolism of APP is critical for our understanding of the pathogenesis of sporadic type AD. The cytoplasmic domain of APP, or APPCOOH, which is highly conserved phylogenetically in vertebrates (38Iijima K. Lee D.-S. Okutsu J. Tomita S. Hirashima N. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. Biochem.

In the present paper, we isolated a cDNA encoding a novel protein, human X11L, as a protein that binds to APPCOOH. This human X11L possesses 55.2% homology to human X11, which has been identified as a gene in the region of the Friedreich ataxia locus (21Duclos F. Boschert U. Sirugo G. Mandel J.-L. Hen R. Koenig M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a degenerative disorder involving both the central and peripheral nervous system (41Harding A.E. The Hereditary Ataxias and Related Disorders. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh1984Google Scholar). Although a partial amino acid sequence consisting of 165 amino acids in the PI domain of X11L has been identified as the APP binding motif (22McLoughlin D.M. Miller C.C.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and the interaction between the PI domain of X11 and a sequence containing the NPTY motif of APPCOOH has been fully analyzed (20Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 33Zhang Z. Lee C.-H. Mandiyan V. Borg J.-P. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Kuriyan J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6141-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the biological function of these proteins has not been determined. Because the amino acid homology between the PI domains from human X11 and human X11L is very high (82.9%), the architecture and APPCOOH recognition mechanism of the PI domains from both proteins may be similar. In the present study, we demonstrate that the interaction of human X11L with APPCOOH is enhanced by deletion of the carboxyl-terminal domain and suppressed by deletion of the amino-terminal domain (Figs. 2 and 4). One possible explanation for these results is that both domains function as regulatory elements of PI domain binding to APPCOOH, possibly indicating that the amino-terminal domain contains an “enhancer” sequence and the carboxyl-terminal domain contains a “suppressor” sequence for PI domain binding to APPCOOH. The deletion of the amino- or carboxyl-terminal domain may alter the conformation of the PI domain, and this may affect the binding affinity to APPCOOH. Although these deleted constructs of human X11L are not physiological products, in vivo, proteins that can interact with the amino- and/or the carboxyl-terminal domains of X11L may regulate APP binding to the PI domain by inducing conformational changes in human X11L. We propose a possible hypothesis for the regulation of X11L binding to APPCOOH (Fig.10). In cells, X11L exists in a free form and shows a weak affinity for APPCOOH (Fig.10 a). When an unidentified “factor X” binds to the amino-terminal domain of X11L, the PI domain adopts an altered conformation and acquires strong binding affinity for APPCOOH (Fig. 10 b). The construct deleted for the carboxyl-terminal domain (N + PI construct) may mimic this strong binding state of X11L (Fig. 10 d). Then the PDZ domain(s) of the stable X11L·APP complex, associate with another factor, “factor Y,” resulting in the suppression of Aβ40 production (Fig.10 c). We have already isolated several novel proteins that bind to the amino-terminal domain. 3S. Tomita, D.-S. Lee, and T. Suzuki, unpublished observations. One of these proteins may be “factor X.”When the ability of full-length human X11L, N + PI, or PI constructs on Aβ production was examined in cells, only full-length human X11L reduced the secretion of Aβ40. This result agrees well with our hypothesis. The constructs deleted for the carboxyl-terminal domain (N +PI construct), which preserves human X11L binding ability for APPCOOH, did not have this modulator activity to regulate Aβ40 secretion. This observation would also appear to support our hypothesis. Neither the PI domain alone nor the N + PI domain is sufficient to regulate APP metabolism if it binds to APPCOOH with higher affinity (Fig. 10, d ande). The human X11L construct lacking the amino-terminal domain (PI + C) loses its binding affinity for APPCOOH(Fig. 10 f). The carboxyl-terminal domain containing the PDZ domains may be essential for the regulation of Aβ40 production. We have not examined how the PDZ domains function to regulate Aβ40 production in detail. However, it has been well established that the PDZ domain interacts with other proteins (32Harrison S.C. Cell. 1996; 86: 341-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 42Gomperts S.N.

Fig. 10 proposes that an association of an unidentified “factor Y” to the PDZ domain(s) may be necessary to regulate APP processing.APPCOOH is not subject to tyrosine phosphorylation, 4T. Suzuki, unpublished observation. and it is believed that the mode of binding of X11 and X11L to a sequence containing the NPXY motif in APPCOOH is a phosphotyrosine-independent interaction such as in the case of Shc phosphotyrosine binding/PI (44Charest A. Wagner J. Jacob S. McGlade C.J. Tremblay M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8424-8429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, APPCOOH contains other phosphorylation sites (45Gandy S.E. Czernik A.J. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6218-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 46Suzuki T. Nairn A.C. Gandy S.E. Greengard P.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1114-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). One of these, Thr668, is located at position 16 in the amino-terminal region of the NPTY motif and is phosphorylated in brain tissue (48Oishi M. Nairn A.C. Czernik A.J. Lim G.S. Isohara T. Gandy S.E. Greengard P. Suzuki T. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 111-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have found that Thr668 phosphorylation of mature APP (mAPP,N- and O-glycosylated form) is neuron-specific, 5Iijima, K., Satoh, Y., Ando, K., Seki, T., Arai, Y., Greengard, P., Nairn, A. C., Kirino, Y., and Suzuki, T., manuscript in preparation. although Thr668 phosphorylation of immature APP (N-glycosylated form) is observed in nonneuronal cells during the mitotic phase of cell division (47Suzuki T. Oishi M. Marshak D.R. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1114-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 48Oishi M. Nairn A.C. Czernik A.J. Lim G.S. Isohara T. Gandy S.E.

Kirino Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4643-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of phosphorylation of APP at Thr668 on the interaction between X11L and APPCOOH. A single amino acid mutation that changed this threonine to alanine or glutamic acid did not alter the binding of APP to the PI domain of human X11L.2 This result indicates that the association of X11L with APPCOOH is not dependent on the phosphorylation of APP.Because proteins containing the PDZ domain are known to play a role in the clustering of membrane receptors and channels (50Ponting C.P. Phillips C. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and because the expression of X11L is brain-specific, X11L may also play an important role in neuronal function(s) through its association with APP. While we were preparing this manuscript, we found that a cDNA similar to human X11L could be isolated from rat as a protein interacting with Munc 18, Mint (51Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Munc 18 is thought to be a protein required for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Mint-1 andMint-2 seem to be rat homologues of human X11 andX11L, respectively. The Munc 18 binding domain is located in the amino-terminal region of the PI domain of X11L/Mint-2, and a complex consisting of Mint and Munc18 is thought to play a role in the docking of synaptic vesicles to the active zone (51Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that APP may play an important role in neurotransmitter release at nerve terminals or that Mint-2 may regulate the binding ability of X11L to APP. Since we have demonstrated that mAPP localizes in the nerve terminals of cholinergic neurons (38Iijima K. Lee D.-S. Okutsu J. Tomita S. Hirashima N. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), one may hypothesize that APP interacts with the exocytotic machinery proteins of synaptic vesicles via X11L/Mint-2. Since cholinergic neurotransmission is thought to be involved in learning and memory processes (52Bartus R.B. Dean R.L. Beer B. Lippa A.S. Science. 1982; 217: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4734) Google Scholar) and loss of function in cholinergic neurotransmission has been observed in senile dementia of AD (53Amenta F. Collier W.L. Zacched D. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1991; 6: 249-273Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar), further characterization of X11L should increase our understanding of the physiological function of APP and the pathogenesis of sporadic type AD.Furthermore, while this manuscript was being reviewed, a report appeared showing that X11 has an inhibitory effect on both Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion using a double transient expression system with APP and X11 cDNAs (54Borg J.-P. Yang Y. De Taddeo-Borg M. Marolis B. Turner R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14761-14766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The X11 and X11L proteins may regulate APP metabolism in a different fashion due to differences in their amino-terminal domain structures. Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein (APP)1 is an integral membrane protein with a receptor-like structure (1Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G.

Because APP is a candidate pathogenic factor of AD, elucidation of the physiological function of APP as well as the determination of the metabolic mechanism of Aβ production should increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of AD. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated cDNA of proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of APP (APPCOOH) in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of APP metabolism and function of APP. Previous efforts to identify and isolate proteins associating with APPCOOH, utilizing the yeast two-hybrid system, have resulted in the isolation of proteins carrying phosphotyrosine binding/phosphotyrosine interaction (PI) domains such as Fe65 (17Fiore F.

Although the contribution of estradiol to endothelial cell function has been addressed, little information is available on the effect of progestins on this cell type. Here, we provide direct evidence for the presence of functional nuclear progesterone receptor in endothelial cells and demonstrate that physiological levels of progesterone inhibit proliferation through a nuclear receptor-mediated mechanism. The effects of progesterone were blocked by pretreatment with a progesterone receptor antagonist, and progesterone receptor-deficient endothelial cells failed to respond to the hormone. We evaluated the effect of progesterone by analysis of aorta re-endothelialization experiments in wild-type and progesterone receptor knockout mice. The rate of re-endothelialization was significantly decreased in wild-type mice when in the presence of progesterone, whereas there was no difference between control and progesterone-treated progesterone receptor knockout mice. FACS analysis showed that progestins arrest endothelial cell cycle in G1. The lag in cell cycle progression involved reduction in cyclin-dependent kinase activity, as shown by down-regulation in retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation. In addition, treatment of endothelial cells with progestins altered the expression of cyclin E and A in accordance with G1 arrest.

As such, PR is considered a transcription factor with known ability to influence development and morphogenesis (5Lydon J.P. DeMayo F.J. Cindee R.F. Mani S.K. Hughes A.R. Montgomery Jr C.A. Shyamala G. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). Aside from its expression in several cell types of the mammary gland, uterus, and ovary, PR has also been identified in brain and vascular tissue (6Apostolakis E.M. Garai J. Clark J.H. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Perrot-Applanat M. Groyer-Picard M.T. Garcia E. Lorenzo F. Milgrom E.

The presence of PR in blood vessels has relevance because of the increase use of progestins in hormone replacement therapy (HRT).HRT with estrogen and progestins has become a well accepted treatment regimen for postmenopausal women, particularly those with an absence of familial breast cancer history. A large body of literature has demonstrated that the benefits of HRT extend beyond the amelioration of symptoms associated with menopause. HRT also aids in the prevention of osteoporosis and in the reduction of cardiovascular disease (9Lobo R.A. Obstet. Gynecol. 1990; 75: 18S-25SCrossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10Sullivan J.M. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2699-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Rossouw J.E. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2982-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Most of these effects have been attributed to estradiol, as demonstrated by several experimental and epidemiological studies. In fact, estradiol has been shown to diminish the incidence of cardiovascular disease up to 45% (12Stampfer M.J. Colditz G.A. Prev. Med. 1991; 20: 47-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar, 13Sullivan J.M. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1995; 38: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14Sullivan J.M. Fowlkes L.P.

Historically, progestins were included to counteract endometrial dysplasia caused by estradiol (11Rossouw J.E.

Although the inclusion of progestins to HRT has recognized value, dosage levels and frequency have been the object of much controversy, mostly due to collateral effects (16Fraser I.S. Diczfalusy E.

Because constant levels of exogenous progestins can be associated with the breakdown of vessels and irregular endometrial bleedings (21Macqueo M. Diczfalusy E. Fraser I.S. Webb F.T.G. Endometrial Bleeding and Steroidal Contraception. Lakartidmingen, Geneva1980: 138-152Google Scholar), we hypothesized that this hormone might play a direct role in endothelial function. Because progesterone mediates signals through its receptor (2Edwards D.P. Altmann M. DeMarzo A. Zhang Y. Weigel N.L. Beck C.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Although expression of progesterone receptor has been previously reported in the intima of blood vessels using biochemical and immunocytochemical approaches (19Colburn P. Buonassisi V.

However, the contribution of progesterone to the replacement regime has been controversial. Although experimental studies evaluating intimal thickness (37Hanke H. Hanke S. Bruck B. Brehme U. Gugel N.

Stampfer M.J. Manson J.E. Colditz G.A. Willett W.C. Rosner B. Speizer F.E. Hennekens C.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar, 40Levine R.L. Chen S.J.

The finding that progesterone inhibits re-endothelialization of denuded aortae suggests that this hormone could have an opposite effect on estradiol in endothelial repair of denuded atherosclerotic lesions (41Krasinski K. Spyridopoulos I. Asahara T. van der Zee R. Isner J.M. Losordo D.W. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1768-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).Atherosclerosis is a multifactorial process and the principal contributor to myocardial and cerebral infarction (42Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9929) Google Scholar). Response to injury is one of the favored hypotheses for development of atherogenesis. It postulates that an alteration of the intima by various risk factors (such as mechanical injury, chemically altered low density lipoprotein, viruses, or toxins) initiates a primary endothelial cell dysfunction that leads to subsequent vascular changes, giving rise to the initial atherosclerotic lesion. The plaque progresses by the accumulation of layers of smooth muscle, macrophages, and foam cells; further deposition of extracellular matrix; and possibly neovascularization. Progression or rupture of the plaque is frequently associated with physical disruption of the endothelium. Because of the role of the endothelium in providing an antithrombotic and anticoagulant surface, rapid endothelial repair is of importance to the containment of atherosclerotic lesions. Although progesterone has shown suppressive effects on smooth muscle cell proliferation in vitro (8Lee W. Harder J.A. Yoshizumi M. Lee M. Haber E. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1005-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), its participation on intimal endothelial repair, according to this study, appears to be equally inhibitory and, by extension, possibly deleterious to the endothelial healing of an exposed lesion.The inhibitory effect of progesterone on endothelial proliferation also provides an explanation for the episodes of vessel breakdown and irregular bleeding associated with progestin-based contraceptives (21Macqueo M. Diczfalusy E. Fraser I.S. Webb F.T.G. Endometrial Bleeding and Steroidal Contraception. Lakartidmingen, Geneva1980: 138-152Google Scholar). Physiological, but constant, levels of circulating progestins most likely affect the high mitotic rate associated with the endometrial vasculature, 3M. Graubert, M. Lombardo, M. A. Ortega, L. F. Brown, B. Kessel, J. F. Mortola, and M. L. Iruela-Arispe, unpublished observations. leading to capillary rupture. Furthermore, progesterone has been implicated in the suppression of tumor-induced neovascularization (43Rao B.R. Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 1019-1022PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we showed that progesterone partially blocks and delays endothelial cell cycle progression through a receptor-mediated mechanism that involves changes in expression of cell cycle proteins, cyclins E and A, and changes in pRb phosphorylation. The participation of PR in the regulation of cell cycle has been controversial, with studies indicating that progesterone stimulates, inhibits, or does not alter cell cycle progression even on the same cell type (8Lee W. Harder J.A. Yoshizumi M. Lee M. Haber E. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1005-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 44Groshong S.D. Owen G.I. Grimison B. Schauer I.E. Todd M.C. Langan T.A.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3933-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). When inhibitory in mammary epithelial cells, the mechanism by which progesterone mediates cell cycle arrest has been shown to implicate both suppression of Cdk activity (47Musgrove E.A. Swarbrick A. Lee C.S.L. Cornish A.L. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1812-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and up-regulation of p21 (48Owen G.I. Richer J.K. Tung L. Takimoto G. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10696-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, however, it is likely that progesterone acts by regulation of Cdk activity only, because we have not detected changes in either p21 nor p27 expression levels (data not shown). It has now become increasingly clear that the functional contribution of PR as a transcription factor is also dependent on the expression of several binding proteins that modulate PR activity (49Prapapanich V. Chen S. Nair S.C. Rimerman R.A. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 420-431PubMed Google Scholar, 50Prapapanich V. Chen S. Smith D.F. Mol. Cell.

Whether or not these binding proteins play a role in the regulation of endothelial cell cycle or any other cell type is, at this point, not clear and deserves further investigation. Nevertheless, we found that endothelial cell proliferation was suppressed by physiological levels of 17-α-hydroxy-progesterone in every endothelial cell type examined.In conclusion, the presence of progesterone receptor in endothelial cells and the direct effect of progesterone described here can be of physiological relevance to the balance between potentiation of endothelial growth, mediated by estradiol, and suppressive signals, mediated by progesterone. This balance could play an important role in the regulation of angiogenesis in the endometrium and corpus luteus during the menstrual cycle. Nonetheless, constant levels of progestins in HRT could be counter-productive. Although the benefits of progestins, as first or second line therapy in the treatment of breast and endometrial carcinoma, have been widely acknowledged, the long-term use of progestins as contraceptives or for the prophylaxis of menopause should be under closer scrutiny. It is clear from these and other data that progestins may have direct growth-inhibitory actions in nonreproductive sites, apart from their ability to inhibit estrogen-mediated cell proliferation in such classical reproductive targets as the endometrium. Progesterone receptor (PR)1 is a member of a family of nuclear receptors capable of regulating gene expression upon binding to the appropriate hormones (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6292) Google Scholar, 2Edwards D.P. Altmann M. DeMarzo A. Zhang Y. Weigel N.L. Beck C.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 53: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 3Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar, 4Mangelsdorf D.J.

As such, PR is considered a transcription factor with known ability to influence development and morphogenesis (5Lydon J.P. DeMayo F.J. Cindee R.F. Mani S.K. Hughes A.R. Montgomery Jr C.A. Shyamala G. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). Aside from its expression in several cell types of the mammary gland, uterus, and ovary, PR has also been identified in brain and vascular tissue (6Apostolakis E.M. Garai J. Clark J.H. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Perrot-Applanat M. Groyer-Picard M.T. Garcia E. Lorenzo F. Milgrom E. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 1511-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 8Lee W. Harder J.A. Yoshizumi M. Lee M. Haber E. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1005-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The presence of PR in blood vessels has relevance because of the increase use of progestins in hormone replacement therapy (HRT). HRT with estrogen and progestins has become a well accepted treatment regimen for postmenopausal women, particularly those with an absence of familial breast cancer history. A large body of literature has demonstrated that the benefits of HRT extend beyond the amelioration of symptoms associated with menopause. HRT also aids in the prevention of osteoporosis and in the reduction of cardiovascular disease (9Lobo R.A. Obstet. Gynecol. 1990; 75: 18S-25SCrossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10Sullivan J.M. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2699-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Rossouw J.E. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2982-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Most of these effects have been attributed to estradiol, as demonstrated by several experimental and epidemiological studies. In fact, estradiol has been shown to diminish the incidence of cardiovascular disease up to 45% (12Stampfer M.J. Colditz G.A. Prev. Med. 1991; 20: 47-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar, 13Sullivan J.M. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1995; 38: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14Sullivan J.M. Fowlkes L.P. Cardiol. Clin. 1996; 14: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The contribution of progesterone to the overall effect of HRT is less clear. Historically, progestins were included to counteract endometrial dysplasia caused by estradiol (11Rossouw J.E. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2982-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 15Whitehead M. Lobo R.A. Lancet. 1988; 2: 1243-1244Abstract PubMed Google Scholar). Although the inclusion of progestins to HRT has recognized value, dosage levels and frequency have been the object of much controversy, mostly due to collateral effects (16Fraser I.S. Diczfalusy E. Diczfalusy E. Fraser I.S. Webb F.T.G. Endometrial Bleeding and Steroidal Contraception. Lakartidmingen, Geneva1980: 384-413Google Scholar, 17Sivin I. Stud. Fam.

In blood vessels, PR has been localized in smooth muscle cells of the tunica media (7Perrot-Applanat M. Groyer-Picard M.T. Garcia E. Lorenzo F. Milgrom E. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 1511-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 19Colburn P. Buonassisi V.

Med. 1997; 3: 1005-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, neither the presence of functional PR nor the effect of progesterone have been addressed on endothelial cells. Because constant levels of exogenous progestins can be associated with the breakdown of vessels and irregular endometrial bleedings (21Macqueo M. Diczfalusy E. Fraser I.S. Webb F.T.G. Endometrial Bleeding and Steroidal Contraception. Lakartidmingen, Geneva1980: 138-152Google Scholar), we hypothesized that this hormone might play a direct role in endothelial function. Because progesterone mediates signals through its receptor (2Edwards D.P. Altmann M. DeMarzo A. Zhang Y. Weigel N.L. Beck C.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 53: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 3Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar, 4Mangelsdorf D.J.

It postulates that an alteration of the intima by various risk factors (such as mechanical injury, chemically altered low density lipoprotein, viruses, or toxins) initiates a primary endothelial cell dysfunction that leads to subsequent vascular changes, giving rise to the initial atherosclerotic lesion. The plaque progresses by the accumulation of layers of smooth muscle, macrophages, and foam cells; further deposition of extracellular matrix; and possibly neovascularization.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3933-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). When inhibitory in mammary epithelial cells, the mechanism by which progesterone mediates cell cycle arrest has been shown to implicate both suppression of Cdk activity (47Musgrove E.A. Swarbrick A. Lee C.S.L. Cornish A.L. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1812-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and up-regulation of p21 (48Owen G.I. Richer J.K. Tung L. Takimoto G. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10696-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, however, it is likely that progesterone acts by regulation of Cdk activity only, because we have not detected changes in either p21 nor p27 expression levels (data not shown). It has now become increasingly clear that the functional contribution of PR as a transcription factor is also dependent on the expression of several binding proteins that modulate PR activity (49Prapapanich V. Chen S. Nair S.C. Rimerman R.A. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 420-431PubMed Google Scholar, 50Prapapanich V. Chen S. Smith D.F. Mol. Cell.

Whether or not these binding proteins play a role in the regulation of endothelial cell cycle or any other cell type is, at this point, not clear and deserves further investigation. Nevertheless, we found that endothelial cell proliferation was suppressed by physiological levels of 17-α-hydroxy-progesterone in every endothelial cell type examined. In conclusion, the presence of progesterone receptor in endothelial cells and the direct effect of progesterone described here can be of physiological relevance to the balance between potentiation of endothelial growth, mediated by estradiol, and suppressive signals, mediated by progesterone. This balance could play an important role in the regulation of angiogenesis in the endometrium and corpus luteus during the menstrual cycle. Nonetheless, constant levels of progestins in HRT could be counter-productive. Although the benefits of progestins, as first or second line therapy in the treatment of breast and endometrial carcinoma, have been widely acknowledged, the long-term use of progestins as contraceptives or for the prophylaxis of menopause should be under closer scrutiny. It is clear from these and other data that progestins may have direct growth-inhibitory actions in nonreproductive sites, apart from their ability to inhibit estrogen-mediated cell proliferation in such classical reproductive targets as the endometrium.

The molecular dissection of the FAS promoter pointed out the critical role of an E box motif, located at position −65 with respect to the start site of transcription, in mediating the glucose- and insulin-dependent regulation of the gene. Upstream stimulatory factors (USF1 and USF2) and sterol response element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) were shown to be able to interact in vitro with this E box. However, to date, the relative contributions of USFs and SREBP1 ex vivo remain controversial. To gain insight into the specific roles of these factorsin vivo, we have analyzed the glucose responsiveness of hepatic FAS gene expression in USF1 and USF2 knock-out mice. In both types of mouse lines, defective in either USF1 or USF2, induction of the FAS gene by refeeding a carbohydrate-rich diet was severely delayed, whereas expression of SREBP1 was almost normal and insulin response unchanged. Therefore, USF transactivators, and especially USF1/USF2 heterodimers, seem to be essential to sustain the dietary induction of the FAS gene in the liver.

Fatty acid synthase (FAS)1 plays a central role in de novo lipogenesis in mammals, catalyzing all reaction steps in the conversion of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to palmitate. As for many other lipogenic and glycolytic genes involved in maintenance of energy balance, the expression of the FAS gene is highly dependent on nutritional conditions in liver and adipose tissue. Expression of the gene is barely detectable in starved animals and is stimulated by refeeding a high carbohydrate, fat-free diet (for review see Refs. 1Girard J. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 325-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholarand 2Towle H.C. Kaytor E.N. Shih H.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 405-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This fasting/refeeding transition is accompanied in vivo by an increased circulating insulin level, and it is often difficult to differentiate the effects of insulin from those of carbohydrate metabolism in mediating the regulation of gene expression. To date, the role of insulin, either direct or indirect, in mediating FAS-activated gene expression, is still disputed. It has been proposed that the effects of insulin could be only indirect (3Semenkovich C.F. Coleman T. Goforth R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6961-6970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Prip-Buus C. Perdereau D. Foufelle F. Maury J. Ferre P. Girard J. Eur. J.

Schweizer M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and in vivo (7Katsurada A. Iritani N. Fukuda H. Matsumura Y. Nishimoto N. Noguchi T. Tanaka T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In this respect, Sul and co-workers (8Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported, by transfection experiments, that the region between −71/−50 was responsible for mediating the effects of insulin on the rat FAS promoter (see Fig.1). They further demonstrated that upstream stimulatory factors (USFs), USF1 and USF2, were major components of the complex binding to this region (called IRS for insulin response sequence) (9Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28716-28722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). USFs are ubiquitous basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (b-HLH-Zip) transcription factors able to interact as homo- and/or heterodimers on E boxes of CANNTG sequence (for review see Ref. 10Littlewood T.D. Evan G.I. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 621-702PubMed Google Scholar). The FAS promoter IRS contains such an E box at position −65 (Fig. 1). Mutations impairing binding of USF1 and USF2 to this E box have been demonstrated to abolish the insulin-dependent activation of the FAS promoter (11Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26367-26374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In a recent paper, Kim et al. (12Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26367-26374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and the authors proposed SREBP1 (sterol response element binding protein 1), instead of USFs, as being the key activator acting through the −65 E box (12Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). As the USFs, SREBPs are b-HLH-Zip transcription factors (for review see Ref. 13Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar). Two members of this family, encoded by two separate genes, have been characterized so far, SREBP1 and SREBP2 (14Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell.

Based on in vivo and ex vivo experiments, it is now assumed that SREBP2 is more specifically devoted to the control of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism and SREBP1 in the control of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism (17Sheng Z.

Unlike other members of the b-HLH-Zip family, SREBPs were shown to bind not only to their specific target sites, namely the sterol response elements, but also to canonical E boxes. This unusual ability to bind to two distinct DNA sequences is due to the presence of an atypical tyrosine in the basic DNA-binding domain at a key position that is occupied by an arginine in almost all other b-HLH-Zip proteins (21Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.D. Shih H.M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In an effort to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of gene expression by glucose in the liver, we previously reported the generation of USF1 and USF2 knock-out mice (22Vallet V.S.

To gain insight into the respective roles of USFs and SREBPs in the regulation of FAS gene expression by glucose and insulin, we have investigated the glucose responsiveness of FAS in USF1 and USF2 knock-out mice. In this paper, we demonstrate that USFs are essential components binding to the −65 E box of the FAS promoter and required for a normal transcriptional response of the FAS gene to dietary carbohydrates in vivo. In addition, we provide evidence that this response is likely dependent on the presence of USF1/USF2 heterodimers, USF1 and USF2 homodimers being insufficient to promote a rapid response of the FAS gene to dietary glucose. USF1- and USF2-deficient mice were generated by gene targeting as described previously (22Vallet V.S. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Casado M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol.

To generate the double heterozygous USF1+/− USF2+/− mice, USF1+/− mice were bred with USF2+/− mice as previously reported (23Vallet V.S. Casado M. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Raymondjean M. Kahn A.

For metabolic studies, animals were fed a high carbohydrate diet for 18 h after a 24-h fast. Mice were sacrificed between 10 and 12 a.m., and tissue samples were stored at −80 °C. Blood samples were collected from the orbital sinus. Serum insulin levels were determined using an insulin radioimmunoassay kit (Behring Diagnostics) with human insulin as standard. Total RNA was purified by a modified guanidium chloride procedure, and Northern blot analysis was conducted as described previously (24Cuif M.H. Cognet M. Boquet D. Tremp G. Kahn A. Vaulont S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4852-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). FAS (25Coupe C. Perdereau D. Ferre P. Hitier Y. Narkewicz M. Girard J. Am. J.

Gene Expr. 1998; 7: 103-113PubMed Google Scholar) cDNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the High Prime system (Boehringer Mannheim). Each Northern blot was stripped and reprobed with a ribosomal 18 S cDNA to check for the integrity and the amount of loaded RNAs. The amount of specific mRNA was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Nuclear and whole cell extracts were prepared according to Viollet et al. (27Viollet B. Lefrancois-Martinez A.-M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and Valletet al.

Western blot analyses were performed with 15 μg of nuclear extracts or 60 μg of whole cell extracts using SREBP1 antibody (K-10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:100 dilution. To ensure comparable loading of the samples, blots performed with whole cell extracts were incubated with anti-annexin V antibody, and those performed with nuclear extracts were incubated with USF1-specific peptide antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or affinity-purified USF2 1–49 antibodies. For electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), the DNA-binding reaction was performed as described previously (27Viollet B. Lefrancois-Martinez A.-M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) in the presence of either 5 μg of rat liver nuclear extracts or 30 μg of whole cell extracts, 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.1–0.5 ng of end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the −65 E box of the FAS promoter (−75 to −52, 5′ GCTGTCAGCCCATGTGGCGTGGCC). For supershift experiments, USF1 and USF2 antibodies were included in the binding reactions (27Viollet B. Lefrancois-Martinez A.-M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed by the Student's t test for unpaired data using the StatView software. The significance has been considered at *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, or ***p < 0.001. To determine the impact of USF1 and USF2 deficiency on glucose responsiveness of FAS gene expression, a series of metabolic analyses were performed on either wild type, USF1−/−, or USF2−/− mice. After a 24-h fast, mice were refed a high carbohydrate diet for 18 h. Total liver RNA was purified and analyzed by Northern blot to estimate the content of FAS mRNA (Fig. 2 A). Quantification of this analysis (Fig. 2 B) revealed that the amount of FAS mRNA was dramatically reduced, to 23% in the liver of USF1−/− mice and to 21% in the liver of USF2−/− mice, as compared with wild type mice. This reduction in the abundance of FAS mRNA was specific to the fasted/refed transition. Indeed, inad libitum fed mice or in mice fed a high carbohydrate diet for 5 days, the amount of FAS mRNA was not significantly altered (data not shown). In addition, this reduction was not due to altered circulating insulin level in USFs-deficient mice. Insulin level was indeed found to be similar between USF1−/− and wild type mice (34.64 ± 15.44 (n = 8) and 32.20 ± 13.78 (n = 11) micro-UI/ml insulin for wild type and USF1 −/− groups, respectively), and between USF2−/− and wild type mice (22Vallet V.S.

Finally, glucose uptake and its utilization by the liver of USF-deficient mice were previously shown to be normal (22Vallet V.S. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Casado M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21944-21949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Vallet V.S. Casado M. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20175-20179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that USF1 and USF2 are likely to be specifically and directly involved in the dietary carbohydrate-dependent activation of FAS gene expression. To determine the nature of USF complexes binding to the specific −65 E box of the FAS gene promoter, EMSA were performed with rat liver nuclear extracts. USF binding activity on this specific E box was shown to be similar to the USF binding activity previously reported on a canonical E box (27Viollet B. Lefrancois-Martinez A.-M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Indeed, as presented in Fig.3 A, USF1/USF2 heterodimers were largely predominant, whereas the amount of USF1 and USF2 homodimers, as determined after incubation with anti-USF1 (lane 2) and anti-USF2 (lane 3) antibodies, was very low (i.e. <10% of total USF binding activity). The same band shift experiments were performed with liver cellular extracts from USF1- and USF2-deficient mice. As shown in Fig. 3 B, in USF1-deficient mice, the USF binding activity on the −65 E box of FAS promoter was accounted for by USF2 homodimers; anti-USF1 antibody was without any effect on USF binding activity (lane 2), whereas anti-USF2 antibody fully displaced the complex (lane 3). Exactly the opposite was found in USF2-deficient mice (lanes 4–6), i.e. the USF binding activity was accounted for by USF1 homodimers on the −65 E box of FAS promoter. The incapacity of USF1 homodimers in USF2-deficient mice and USF2 homodimers in USF1-deficient mice to support a normal dietary activation of FAS gene transcription suggests that the heterodimeric species could have a specific role in the regulation of the FAS gene compared with the homodimeric species. This idea is strengthened by the fact that FAS mRNA content was reduced to the same extent in both USF1−/− and USF2−/− mice. Therefore, to address further the question of the specific role of USF1/USF2 heterodimer, we examined FAS gene expression in double heterozygous mice where the USF binding activity, mainly accounted for by the heterodimer, was shown to be reduced to 46% (23Vallet V.S. Casado M. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20175-20179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We compared by Northern blot analysis the amount of hepatic FAS mRNA in USF1+/− USF2+/− mice and wild type mice refed a high carbohydrate diet for 18 h (Fig.4 A). As shown in Fig.4 B, the amount of FAS mRNA in the liver of double heterozygous mice was reduced to 50% of normal, which is to say about 2-fold less than in homozygous USF1−/− and USF2−/− mice. We can speculate that this better response of the FAS gene in double heterozygous mice compared with homozygous mice reflects the higher efficacy of the USF heterodimers compared with both types of homodimers. Indeed, total residual USF binding activity is reduced to the same extent (i.e. to 40–46% of normal) in the three types of knock-out animals (23Vallet V.S. Casado M. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D.

Indeed, for two glucose-regulated genes previously investigated, namelyL-PK and S14 genes, the glucose-dependent gene transcription was reported to be impaired in USF2−/− mice but not in USF1−/− mice, suggesting that, in these latter mice, residual USF2 homodimers are as efficient as the heterodimers to allow for a normal glucose responsiveness ofL-PK and S14 genes (22Vallet V.S.

The differential transactivating properties of USF1 and USF2 dimers in activating different sets of glucose-responsive genes could be functionally achieved through the different nature of USF-binding sites as well as of flanking sequences. Indeed, the L-PK and S14 genes have a regulatory element (termed glucose/carbohydrates response element, GlRE) which presents striking similarities (Fig. 1). It consists of two CACGTG type E box motifs whose precise spacing and orientation are critical to create a functional glucose response element (2Towle H.C. Kaytor E.N. Shih H.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 405-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 28Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Bergot M.O. Martinez A. Cuif M.H. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7725-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This architecture is not found for the −65 FAS E box which is not palindromic and, therefore, does not obey the criteria reported above for the functional glucose/carbohydrates response elements (Fig. 1). Thus, the requirements of these different types of USF-binding sites for USF isoforms can be different. In addition, binding sites for auxiliary factors have been shown to be essential for the S14 andL-PK GlRE (28Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Bergot M.O. Martinez A. Cuif M.H. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7725-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 29Shih H.-M. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and could also be involved in the functional specificity of USF dimers. Finally, it is noteworthy that the role of the −65 FAS E box and of USFs in the dietary response of the FAS gene does not signify that this element is itself the “response element” but that it is required, perhaps with other elements, for this response. Our present study seems to establish the fundamental role of USFs in the response of FAS to dietary glucose. However, following the recent report of Kim et al. (12Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) on the predominant role of SREBP1 in the nutritional control of FAS, it was important to establish whether SREBP1 level was affected in USF1- and USF2-deficient mice. To this end, we measured by Northern blot analysis the amount of SREBP1 mRNA in the liver of USF1−/− and USF2−/− mice as compared with wild type mice. Fig.5, A and B, shows that the amount of SREBP1 mRNA was normal in USF1−/− mice and only slightly reduced (30% decreased) in USF2−/− mice as compared with wild type controls. To regulate gene transcription, SREBP must be post-translationally activated by a proteolytic cascade; the mature NH2-terminal domain of the protein is released from the endothelial reticulum membranes into the cytosol and then rapidly translocated into the nucleus (13Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the concentrations of mature SREBP1 in the liver of USF1- and USF2-deficient mice. As shown in the Western blot of Fig.6 A, the amount of mature SREBP1 seemed to be similar in liver cellular extracts from either wild type, USF1-, or USF2-deficient mice, indicating that proteolytic processing of SREBP1 was normal in USF-deficient mice. Furthermore, this mature form of SREBP1 was properly translocated into the nucleus as demonstrated by the similar level of SREBP1 in nuclear extracts from wild type and USF-deficient mice (Fig. 6 B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the absence of USFs is likely the primary event responsible for the dramatic decrease in FAS gene induction upon carbohydrate refeeding and that a normal level of mature SREBP1, in absence of USFs, is unable to support a proper nutritional activation of FAS gene expression.Figure 6SREBP1 content in liver extracts from either wild type, USF1- or USF2-deficient mice. A, Western blot analysis was performed with 60 μg of liver cellular extracts from animals fasted for 24 h and refed a carbohydrate-rich diet for 18 h (three separate animals in each group) using an anti-SREBP1 peptide antibody. Loading of the samples was checked with an anti-annexin V antibody. B, Western blot analysis was performed as above with 15 μg of nuclear extracts. Loading of the samples was checked with anti-USF1 or anti-USF2 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Therefore, our results are in accordance with the data of Wang and Sul (11Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26367-26374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and strongly suggest that USFs are required for the nutrition-dependent activity of the FAS promoter. Of course, these results are not sufficient to rule out the possible involvement of SREBP1. However, Shimano et al. (30Shimano H. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) recently reported that in the liver and adipocytes of SREBP1−/− mice, the levels of mRNAs for fatty acid synthesis enzymes, including the FAS mRNA, were normal. Although this could be related to compensatory increase of SREBP2 expression in the liver, this factor was undetectable in adipocytes of SREBP1−/− mice in which the abundance of the FAS mRNA was normal (30Shimano H. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the idea that, on a physiological point of view, SREBPs play a predominant role in regulating the cholesterol synthesis (through sterol response elements and not E box) and have an auxiliary role only in fatty acid synthesis. In this line, Athanikar and Osborne (31Athanikar J.N. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4935-4940Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) recently suggested that FAS activation through the −65 E box must occur through more specific regulators of fatty acid metabolism than SREBPs factors to provide the mechanism to regulate independently as well as coordinately the biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol. It is noteworthy that this interpretation of the respective role of USFs and SREBPs in dietary activation of lipogenic genes is not inconsistent with the observation that overproduction of truncated form of SREBP1 in the liver results in constitutive activation of these genes, especially the FAS gene (19Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 32Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). In this case, indeed, it could be that processed SREBP1 in excess constitutively binds to the E box and activates transcription, bypassing the USF-dependent regulation. How USFs manage to regulate the transcriptional response to dietary glucose is not yet fully elucidated. Preliminary results in our laboratory suggest that the transactivating potential of USFs is modulated by a glucose-sensor complex interacting, as USFs, with canonical GlREs. 2D-Q. Lou, M. Tannour, L. Selig, D. Thomas, A. Kahn, and M. Vasseur-Cognet, personal communication. However, whether the FAS gene contains authentic GlREs is not clear. Foufelleet al. (33Foufelle F. Lepetit N. Bosc D. Delzenne N. Morin J. Raymondjean M. Ferre P. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) reported an element in the FAS gene first intron with similar properties to known glucose-responsive elements. However, this element was demonstrated to be ineffective in supporting the dietary gene regulation in the natural context (29Shih H.-M. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and to be dispensable for in vivo response of a FAS transgene to carbohydrate refeeding (34Soncini M. Yet S.-F. Moon Y. Chun J.-Y. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30339-30343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As discussed above, the −65 E box, essential in cell culture for the response to insulin, is not an authentic palindromic GlRE, and its cis-effect has not been verifiedin vivo. Whether this element is really involved in the response to insulin or rather to insulin-dependent increase of the glycolytic flux is also not yet clear. As a matter of fact, the sensitivity of the FAS gene to USF deficiencies suggests that this gene belongs to the class of the glucose-responsive genes, such as the L-PK and S14 genes, rather than to that of the strictly insulin-responsive genes, essentially represented by the glucokinase gene (2Towle H.C. Kaytor E.N. Shih H.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 405-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Indeed, regulation of the glucokinase gene is normal in USF1 and USF2 knock-out mice (22Vallet V.S. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Casado M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21944-21949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Vallet V.S. Casado M. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20175-20179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Further investigations on knock-out mice are needed to firmly establish that the dependence of dietary-regulated genes on USF really permits us to predict which of them are authentic glucose-responsive genes and which are rather regulated by insulin or other glucose-dependent hormones. We thank M. Raymondjean for helpful discussions and advice and for providing the rat SREBP1 probe. Help was kindly supplied by M. Blache."

The aim of this study was to examine whether SP-22 is involved in mitochondrial antioxidant mechanisms and whether its expression is induced by oxidative stresses, particularly those in mitochondria. The expression of SP-22 protein was enhanced by about 1.5–4.6-fold when bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were exposed to various oxidative stresses, including mitochondrial respiratory inhibitors which increased the superoxide generation in BAEC mitochondria.

BAEC with an increased level of SP-22 protein caused by pretreatment with mild oxidative stress became tolerant to subsequent intense oxidative stress. On the other hand, BAEC that had been depleted of SP-22 with an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against SP-22 mRNA became more labile to oxidative stress than control BAEC.

Mitochondria play an important role in aerobic energy metabolism of living cells. The mitochondrial electron transport system consumes approximately 85% of the oxygen utilized by the cell, and about 5% of the oxygen is converted to reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs)1 (1Forman H.J.

A. 1994; 91: 10771-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). The generation of ROIs in mitochondria has been reported to impair various cellular functions by attacking reactive moieties of macromolecules such as protein, DNA, and lipid (3Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar, 4Cahill A. Wang X. Hoek J.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Mitochondrial permeability transition, which may be an initial event in the process of cell death induced by Ca2+ and inorganic phosphate, has recently been reported to be mediated by ROIs and prevented by antioxidants in vitro (7Kowaltowski A.J. Netto L.E. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12766-12769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial protein SP-22 was originally isolated from bovine adrenal cortex as a substrate protein for mitochondrial ATP-dependent protease (8Watabe S. Kohno H. Kouyama H. Hiroi T. Yago N. Nakazawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9Watabe S. Hasegawa H. Takimoto K. Yamamoto Y. Takahashi S.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 1010-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). An analysis of its amino acid sequence revealed that SP-22 is a member of the thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase family like the C22 component of alkyl hydroperoxidase in Salmonella typhimurium (10Tartaglia L.A.

Gene (Amst). 1989; 80: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) in mammalian cells. MER5 is 92% similar to SP-22 protein and considered to be a mouse homolog of SP-22 (15Watabe S. Hiroi T. Yamamoto Y. Fujioka Y. Hasegawa H. Yago N. Takahashi S.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Members of this family have a highly conserved active site sequence among a wide range of species and are believed to act as antioxidant systems together with the NADPH-thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase system (11Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Among the members of the thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase family, SP-22 is the only protein located in mitochondria. To test the hypothesis that SP-22 functions as an antioxidant system in mitochondria, which are the major site of cellular ROI generation, we investigated the oxidant-induced expression of SP-22 using cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) and an in vivo model of experimental myocardial infarction. Furthermore, we also examined the antioxidant function of SP-22 using BAEC with decreased or increased levels of SP-22 protein produced by treatment with antisense oligodeoxynucleotide or mild oxidant preconditioning. The present results indicate that SP-22 plays a crucial role in the antioxidant defense mechanism of mitochondria in the cardiovascular system. BAEC were harvested from bovine thoracic aorta obtained from a local slaughterhouse and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) as described by Kaku et al. (17Kaku Y. Nanri H. Sakimura T. Ejima K. Kuroiwa A. Ikeda M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1356: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The identity of endothelial cells was verified by their characteristic morphology and the presence of factor VIII-associated antigen. Endothelial cells at up to passage 10 were used for these experiments. Mouse anti-manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA), anti-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) monoclonal antibody was from NOF Co. (Tokyo, Japan), 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium was from Aldrich, paraquat from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan), antimycin A and superoxide dismutase were from Sigma, and glucose oxidase and xanthine oxidase were from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). Other chemicals were standard commercial products of analytical grade. Monolayers of confluent BAEC were incubated for the indicated periods with/without oxidative stress agents in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Nissui, Japan) containing 0.5% FCS at 37 °C. After washing the monolayers, cells were disrupted in 150 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mmEDTA, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin, and 20 μm(p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride) and homogenized with a Teflon homogenizer. After centrifugation at 7000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, lactate dehydrogenase activity in the supernatant was assayed as described by Bergmeyeret al. (17Kaku Y. Nanri H. Sakimura T. Ejima K. Kuroiwa A. Ikeda M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1356: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The peptide SPTASREYFEKVNQ, corresponding to residues 183–195 of the SP-22 protein (9Watabe S. Hasegawa H. Takimoto K. Yamamoto Y. Takahashi S.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 1010-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), was synthesized and conjugated with hemocyanin. Female Japanese white rabbits were subcutaneously immunized with the conjugated peptide (500 μg) emulsified with adjuvant (Titer Max, Sigma). The first booster injection (250 μg) was given 4 weeks later, and this was followed by three booster injections (250 μg each) at 2-week intervals. Sera were obtained 2 weeks after the last booster injection. For immunofluorescence microscopy, KB cells grown on coverslips in minimal essential medium/10% FCS were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.1% saponine. The permeabilized cells were reacted with anti SP-22 antibody and then stained with rhodamine-conjugated second antibody. Electron immunocytochemistry of bovine mitochondria was carried out as described previously (18Kang D. Nishida J. Iyama A. Nakabeppu Y. Furuichi M. Fujiwara T. Sekiguchi M. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14659-14665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The crude mitochondrial fraction of KB cells was pelleted, fixed with 8% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and embedded in LR white resin at 50 °C. Thin sections of the mitochondria were incubated with the antibody against the SP-22, and then incubated with anti-rabbit IgG-gold. Immunolabeled sections were then stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined under a Hitachi HU 12 electron microscope at 100 kV. Control experiments done with preimmune serum gave no immunoreactive signals. BAEC submitochondrial particles (SMP) were prepared essentially as described by Kang et al. (18Kang D. Nishida J. Iyama A. Nakabeppu Y. Furuichi M. Fujiwara T. Sekiguchi M. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14659-14665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, BAEC were washed in an isotonic sucrose buffer composed of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 15 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, and 50 ng/ml pepstatin, and suspended in the same buffer (1 × 108 cells/ml). The cells were homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer and centrifuged twice at 600 ×g for 10 min to obtain post-nuclear supernatant. The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 7000 × gfor 10 min. The pellet (crude mitochondrial fraction) was sonicated and centrifuged at 320,000 × g for 1 h. The resultant pellet was homogenized in an isotonic sucrose buffer and served as the SMP fraction. Superoxide production by SMP was determined by the oxidation of adrenaline to adrenochrome, and was corrected by subtracting the rate in the presence of 10 μg/ml superoxide dismutase as described by Takeshige et al. (19Takeshige K. Minakami S. Biochem. J. 1979; 180: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). SP-22 protein of BAEC was determined by immunoblotting. Proteins (20 μg) from each sample of BAEC were separated by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), electrotransferred onto Immobilon P (Millipore), and probed with anti-SP-22 serum. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody and POD Immunostain (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Semiquantitative RT-RCR was performed to quantitate SP-22 mRNAs in oxidant-treated BAEC, as described previously (17Kaku Y. Nanri H. Sakimura T. Ejima K. Kuroiwa A. Ikeda M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1356: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from confluent BAEC using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) based on the method reported by Chomczynski and Sacchi (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63167) Google Scholar). RT reactions were carried out with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reverse-transcribed cDNA products were amplified withTaq DNA polymerase in a PJ2000 DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer). The conditions for each cycle were 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min (31 cycles). The following gene-specific primers for SP-22 were used: 5′-tcacgatgtgaactgcgaagttg-3′(bases 366–388, sense) and 5′-ggatggggcttgattgtaggag-3′(bases 710–731, antisense), which amplified a 366-base pair product. Each primer set yielded a single PCR product of the predicted size. The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by direct cycle sequencing. RT-PCR was also performed for the housekeeping gene β-actin as a control for the amount of RNA used in the RT reaction. A negative control, in which reverse transcriptase was omitted, was also performed to exclude the possibility of the amplification of contaminating genomic DNA. Linear relationships were observed between the quantity of RNA subjected to the RT reaction and the amount of amplified PCR product under the PCR conditions used for SP-22 (31 cycles) and β-actin (24 cycles) (Fig.1). SP-22 PCR products (366 base pairs) were subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) by means of the TA cloning technique. After confirming the direction of the PCR insert by sequencing, the plasmids with inserts were linearized withBSP 120I (Fermentas Ltd., Vilnius, Lithuania) and transcribed in vitro into digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled cRNA with SP6 RNA polymerase using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Total RNA (5 μg) was dissolved in 12 μl of sample buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 50% (w/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, and 1 m glyoxal. After denaturation (1 h at 50 °C), the samples were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gel with a 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, and then transferred to a nylon membrane (Boehringer Mannheim) and immobilized by incubation for 30 min at 121 °C. Hybridization with the DIG-labeled cRNA probe was carried out overnight at 68 °C in 500 mm sodium phosphate, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA (21Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). Blots were washed twice at room temperature with 200 mmsodium phosphate, 5% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA, and for 15 min at 65 °C with 0.2× SSC plus 0.2% SDS before color reaction using a DIG nucleic acid detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the instructions provided by the supplier. The amount of SP-22 mRNA was normalized by 18 S ribosomal RNA. BAEC were preincubated with 3.3 μm Fe2+, 330 μm dithiothreitol (DTT) for 24 h, which maximally increased the expression of SP-22 protein. These treated BAEC were then exposed to more intense oxidative stress consisting of 3.3 μm Fe2+, 1 mm DTT for 24 h, and cell viabilities were evaluated by measuring the lactate dehydrogenase activities of the cell lysate. A 20-mer antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) was synthesized by Toagosei Inc. Japan. The first antisense ODN sequence (antisense 1; 5′-catcttcgttatgcagggct-3′) is directed against the translation initiation region of the SP-22 mRNA. The second antisense ODN (antisense 2; 5′-ccttcaccaagcggagggtc-3′) is directed against the internal region of SP-22 mRNA. We also prepared a sense ODN of antisense 1 and 2, and several random ODNs for a control experiment. All of these ODNs were designed to not possess sequences homologous to other genomic sequences or strong secondary structures (22Wagner R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). For efficient transfection of BAEC, we used the cationic lipid Tfx-50 reagent (Promega). ODNs that had been diluted in 30 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7.4 (final concentration of 3.3 μm), and 5 μl of Tfx-50 reagent (final concentration of 5 μm), which was prepared according to the instructions provided by the supplier, were mixed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The ODN/Tfx-50 reagent mixture was added to each plate with 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium without FCS, and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were gently overlaid with 2 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS. This process was performed twice more at 24-h intervals. Adult male Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were used for these experiments. The experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines specified for institutional animal care and use of the University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan. The animals were anesthetized and ventilated by a Harvard small animal respirator. The left descending coronary artery was ligated via a left-sided thoracotomy, which results in infarction of the free left ventricular wall (23Maclean D. Fishbein M.C. Braunwald E. Maroko P.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In a sham procedure, a superficial suture was placed in the epicardium of the left ventricle, near the left descending coronary artery. A total of 9 infarcted rats and 9 sham-operated rats (n = 3 per time point) were killed either 1 or 2 days after surgery. The heart was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The hearts from the sham group and infarct group, at 1 or 2 days after the operation (n = 3), were cut and the sections were fixed with acetone for 5 min. Endogenous peroxidase was then blocked with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol. The thin sections were reacted with the anti-SP-22 polyclonal antibody and anti-HNE monoclonal antibody, and stained by a Vectastain® Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The intensity of the stained bands in immunoblotting, Northern blotting, and RT-PCR was quantitated by densitometric analysis using the public domain computer program NIH Image (Wayne Rasband, NIH, Research Service Branch, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD), and the results are expressed as means ± S.E. A statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. We prepared an antibody against SP-22 protein and used it for immunological analysis. In immunoblotting, this antibody detected a single band with a molecular mass corresponding to SP-22 (22 kDa) in total homogenate and the mitochondrial fraction of BAEC, but not in the cytosol fraction (Fig.2 A). Intracellular distribution of SP-22 protein was further examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. When cultured KB cells were stained with the anti-SP-22 antibody, the signals of immunoreactive SP-22 exhibited the mitochondrial staining pattern characterized by a reticular staining appearance (Fig. 2 B). Immunostaining signals were hardly visible when preimmune sera for SP-22 were used. The localization of the SP-22 protein in the mitochondria was further confirmed by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. The mitochondrial fraction isolated from KB cells was stained with the anti-SP-22 antibody, followed by gold-labeled second antibody. Proteins reactive to the antibody were located in the mitochondria (Fig.2 C). These results indicate that SP-22 protein is located in mitochondria of culture cells, which is consistent with the results of the biochemical analysis by Watabe et al. (8Watabe S. Kohno H. Kouyama H. Hiroi T. Yago N. Nakazawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Exposing BAEC to Fe2+/DTT, which produces the hydroxyl radical through the Fenton reaction (24Lesko S.A. Lorentzen R.J. Ts'o P.O.

FEBS Lett. 1978; 86: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), increased the expression of SP-22 protein in a time-dependent manner, with the maximal elevation occurring after 24 h of exposure. On the other hand, the expression of MnSOD was induced only slightly in this condition (Fig.3). SP-22 expression was completely suppressed with Fe chelators, such as deferoxamine and diethylene triamineacetic acid (Table I). TableII summarizes the effects of various oxidative stresses on the induction of SP-22 protein in BAEC. There was no apparent difference in the induction profile specific to ROI species. Peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide,tert-butylhydroperoxide, and cummene hydroperoxide enhanced SP-22 protein about 1.5–2.3-fold. Glucose oxidase and xanthine/xanthine oxidase, which produce hydrogen peroxide and superoxide (26Kwak H.S. Yim H.S. Chock P.B. Yim M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, diethylmaleate and buthionine sulfoximine, which are glutathione depletors that have been shown to induce other thioredoxindependent peroxide reductase proteins (12Ishii T. Yamada M. Sato H.

Rotenone, paraquat, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, antimycin A, and KCN, which are respiratory chain inhibitors that increase ROI generation in mitochondria (29Freeman B.A. Crapo J.D. Lab. Invest. 1982; 47: 412-426PubMed Google Scholar), also enhanced SP-22 protein by 1.6–3.2-fold. ROI generation in SMP treated with antimycin A and rotenone showed 40–100% increase compared with untreated SMP (TableIII). Based on the rate of superoxide generation by antimycin A-treated SMP (4.1 nmol/min/mg protein), the antimycin A-treated confluent BAEC (107 cells) produced superoxide roughly at a rate of 0.13 nmol/min/mg protein (assuming that the protein content of SMP in 107 cells is about 0.065 mg), which is about 800-fold lower than the rate of superoxide generation produced by exogenous xanthine/xanthine oxidase (50 milliunits/ml), whereas the SP-22 protein induced by antimycin A treatment was about 3-fold higher than that induced by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase treatment, suggesting that superoxide production in mitochondria induced SP-22 expression more effectively.Table IInduction of SP-22 protein in BAEC exposed to the Fe2+/DTT systemStress agentsRelative SP-22 protein levelsFe2+ (3.3 μm)/DTT (330 μm)1.92 ± 0.19Fe2+ (3.3 μm)/DTT (500 μm)2.65 ± 0.53Fe2+ (3.3 μm)/DTT (1 mm)4.61 ± 0.83Fe2+ (3.3 μm)/DTT (330 μm) + DETAPAC (1 mm)0.92 ± 0.08Fe2+ (3.3 μm)/DTT (500 μm) + DETAPAC (1 mm)0.84 ± 0.13Fe2+ (3.3 μm)/DTT (1 mm) + DETAPAC (1 mm)0.93 ± 0.10DETAPAC (1 mm)0.85 ± 0.07Fe2+ (3.3 μm)/DTT (1 mm) + deferoxamine (1 mm)1.04 ± 0.26Deferoxamine (1 mm)0.64 ± 0.08BAEC were incubated for 24 h with Fe2+/DTT.

We co-expressed the calcium channel pore-forming α1Csubunit with different accessory β subunits in HEK-tsA201 cells and examined the subcellular localization of the channel subunits by immunohistochemistry using confocal microscopy and whole-cell radioligand binding studies. While the pore-forming α1Csubunit exhibited perinuclear staining when expressed alone, and several of the wild-type and mutant β subunits also exhibited intracellular staining, co-expression of the α1C subunit with either the wild-type β2a subunit, a palmitoylation-deficient β2a(C3S/C4S) mutant or three other nonpalmitoylated β isoforms (β1b, β3, and β4 subunits) resulted in the redistribution of both the α1C and β subunits into clusters along the cell surface. Furthermore, the redistribution of calcium channel complexes to the plasma membrane was observed when α1C was co-expressed with an N- and C-terminal truncated mutant β2a containing only the central conserved regions. However, when the α1C subunit was co-expressed with an α1β interaction-deficient mutant, β2aBID−, we did not observe formation of the channels at the plasma membrane. In addition, an Src homology 3 motif mutant of β2a that was unable to interact with the α1C subunit also failed to target channel complexes to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, co-expression of the pore-forming α1C subunit with the largely peripheral accessory α2δ subunit was ineffective in recruiting α1C to the plasma membrane, while co-distribution of all three subunits was observed when β2a was co-expressed with the α1C and α2δ subunits. Taken together, our results suggested that the signal necessary for correct plasma membrane targeting of the class C L-type calcium channel complexes is generated as a result of a functional interaction between the α1 and β subunits.

Voltage-dependent calcium channels are heteromultimeric complexes composed minimally of one of the various isoforms of the pore-forming α1 subunit together with accessory β and α2δ subunits (1De Waard M.

Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1111-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In contrast to the cytoplasmic orientation of the β subunit, the α2δ subunit consists of the extracellular α2 peptide disulfide-bonded to the membrane-spanning δ-peptide (1De Waard M. Gurnett C.A.

Co-expression of a β subunit with an α1 subunit in heterologous expression systems results in an increase in the number of binding sites for drugs or toxins known to bind to the channels, an increase in peak current amplitude, and an increase in the number of channels at the cell surface (4Chien A.J.

The increase in peak current amplitude observed upon β subunit co-expression is probably due to the increase in the number of plasma membrane-localized channels (5Chien A.J. Carr K.M. Shirokov R.E.

The effects of the α2δ subunit and the molecular events underlying α2δ-mediated regulation of the channels are less well understood (1De Waard M. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. Ion Channels. 1996; 4: 41-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Co-expression of the α2δ subunit with the cardiac α1C subunit resulted in increased peak current amplitude and altered channel kinetics in Xenopus oocytes (9Singer D. Biel M. Lotan I. Flockerzi V.

However, more biochemical studies are required to further understand the modulatory effects of the α2δ and β subunits. Little is known about the targeting signals that direct calcium channels to the plasma membrane. We have recently demonstrated that the rat β2a isoform is palmitoylated, while other β isoforms, including the β1b, β3, and β4 subunits, are not (5Chien A.J. Carr K.M. Shirokov R.E. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26465-26468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The palmitoylation sites have been mapped to Cys3 and Cys4 in the N terminus of the rat β2a subunit (5Chien A.J. Carr K.M. Shirokov R.E. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26465-26468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation appears to play a role in the targeting of the β2 subunit to the plasma membrane when it is expressed in the absence of an α1 subunit (19Chien A.J. Gao T. Perez-Reyes E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23590-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation-deficient β2a mutants and other nonpalmitoylated β isoforms were localized intracellularly when expressed in the absence of other channel subunits (19Chien A.J. Gao T. Perez-Reyes E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23590-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, palmitoylation appears to confer unique regulatory properties to the rat β2a subunit (20Qin N. Platano D. Olcese R. Costantin J.L. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): 102Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether palmitoylation is an important signal for targeting of channel complexes. Here, we further investigated the role of β subunits in plasma membrane targeting of calcium channel complexes. To identify the region in β subunits required for targeting, we have expressed the α1C subunit with different wild-type and mutant β subunits in HEK-tsA201 cells and assessed the localization of channel subunits using confocal microscopy and whole-cell radioligand binding studies. Since the membrane and extracellular orientation of the α2δ subunit might suggest a role in targeting other channel subunits to the membrane, the effect of the α2δ subunit in membrane targeting of the channel complexes was also studied. All reagents were obtained from general sources unless otherwise noted. The calcium channel subunit-specific antibodies used in this study including Card C, βGEN, and anti-β2 antibodies were described previously (4Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F.

Briefly, the transfected cells were fixed in precooled (−20 °C) methanol/acetone (1:1) for 5–10 min at 4 °C and followed by incubating with labeling buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) to block nonspecific binding. Different primary antibodies were diluted in labeling buffer and incubated with cells for 1–2 h at room temperature. The secondary antibodies including fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were used subsequently. The cellular distributions of the expressed channel proteins were visualized using a Zeiss LSM-10 laser scanning microscope. Transfected tsA201 cells were homogenized, and crude membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (4Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J.

For co-immunoprecipitation of α1 and β subunits, membrane particulate fractions were solubilized in solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.4 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS containing protease inhibitors (4Chien A.J.

Solubilized proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight with agitation at 4 °C using βGEN antibodies coupled to protein G-Ultralink resin (Pierce). Immunoprecipitates were washed with solubilization buffer 3–5 times and eluted with SDS sample buffer. Immunoblotting procedures were performed as described previously (4Chien A.J. Zhao X.

Detection of immunoreactive bands was performed using either enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) or colorimetric enhanced diaminobenzidine substrate reaction (Pierce). To detect membrane localization of L-type calcium channels, ligand binding experiments were performed using the dihydropyridine (DHP)1 radioligand (+)-[3H]PN200–110 with intact cells transfected with different combinations of the channel subunits. The experimental procedures were as described previously (4Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Scatchard analyses were performed to assess B max andK d values. Previously, we had demonstrated that co-expression of the rat β2a subunit with the α1C subunit resulted in an increase in the number of functional channels at the cell surface as assessed by immunohistochemical and electrophysiological analyses (4Chien A.J.

We and others subsequently confirmed this finding by electrophysiological measurements of whole-cell charge movement (5Chien A.J. Carr K.M. Shirokov R.E. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26465-26468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 6Josephson I.R. Varadi G. Biophys.

Since the β2a subunit is a palmitoylated protein (5Chien A.J. Carr K.M. Shirokov R.E. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26465-26468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), it was possible that palmitoylation was playing a role in targeting channels to the plasma membrane. However, co-expression of either the wild-type β2a subunit or the palmitoylation-deficient β2a(C3S/C4S) subunit with the α1C subunit resulted in an increase in the amount of measured whole-cell charge-movement, suggesting that palmitoylation was not required for the formation of channel complexes (5Chien A.J. Carr K.M. Shirokov R.E. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26465-26468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In order to obtain further insight into the role of palmitoylation of the β2 subunit in the formation and membrane targeting of α1C complexes, transiently transfected cells expressing the α1C subunit alone or the α1C subunit in combination with either the wild-type β2a or the mutant β2a(C3S/C4S) subunits were analyzed biochemically as well as by confocal immunofluorescent microscopy. Membrane particulate fractions from transfected cells expressing the α1C subunit in combination with either the β2a or the β2a(C3S/C5S) subunit were solubilized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following immunoprecipitation of solubilized proteins with the βGENantiserum, immunoblotting was used to detect the presence of the α1C and β2a proteins in the immunoprecipitated pellets. Immunostaining of the immunoprecipitates with the Card C antiserum revealed that the α1C subunit co-purified with both the β2a and β2a(C3S/C4S) subunits (Fig.1 A, top), suggesting that the loss of palmitoylation in the β2a(C3S/C4S) mutant did not noticeably disrupt interactions between the α1C and β2asubunits. The presence of the β2a and β2a(C3S/C4S) subunits in the immunoprecipitated pellets was confirmed by immunoblotting with the β2a antiserum (Fig. 1 A, bottom). In confocal microscopy studies, cells expressing the α1Csubunit alone exhibited a perinuclear staining pattern (Fig.1 B, left; the phase image is shown on theright), while co-expression of the α1C subunit with the β2a subunit resulted in a striking change of the α1C subunit staining to a punctate pattern at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1 C, left). Both of these findings are consistent with previous results (4Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when co-expressed with the α1C subunit, the staining pattern of the β2a subunit also changed to a more punctate and less continuous pattern (Fig. 1 C, right) along the cell surface compared with the continuous membrane staining of cells expressing the β2a subunit alone that we observed previously (19Chien A.J. Gao T. Perez-Reyes E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23590-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It was of interest to determine if a similar or different pattern of staining would be observed when the α1C subunit was co-expressed with the palmitoylation-deficient β2a(C3S/C4S) subunit. Co-expression of the α1C subunit with the β2a(C3S/C4S) mutant resulted in punctate staining of the α1C subunit at the cell surface (Fig. 1 D,left panel). Notably, co-expression with the α1C subunit also led to redistribution of the β2a(C3S/C4S) protein to the plasma membrane (Fig.2 D, right), despite the fact that this mutant protein, when expressed in the absence of the α1C subunit, was localized intracellularly (19Chien A.J. Gao T. Perez-Reyes E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23590-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These results support the hypothesis that the multimerization of channel subunits, which likely occurs during or shortly after synthesis of the individual peptides, allows the proper folding and assembly of channel complexes and facilitates their transport to the cell surface. From these results, as well as previously reported electrophysiological results (5Chien A.J. Carr K.M. Shirokov R.E. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26465-26468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the lack of palmitoylation of the β2asubunit did not appear to affect subunit interactions that are critical for channel formation and targeting. To test whether the three other β isoforms can form complexes with and cause membrane targeting of the α1C subunit, we co-expressed the α1C subunit with the β1b, β3, or β4 subunits in tsA201 cells. The subcellular localization pattern of the α1C subunit was revealed by immunostaining with the Card C antibody. Punctate staining of α1C subunit clusters was observed along plasma membranes in α1Cβ1b-, α1Cβ3-, and α1Cβ4-transfected cells (Fig. 2). A phase-contrast image of α1Cβ4-transfected cells was used as an example to confirm the plasma membrane outlines of the cells (Fig. 2 C, right). Although the β1b, β3, and β4 subunits were nonpalmitoylated and were intracellularly localized when expressed alone (5Chien A.J. Carr K.M. Shirokov R.E. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26465-26468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 19Chien A.J. Gao T. Perez-Reyes E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23590-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), all three β subunits were able to cause redistribution of the α1C subunit from a perinuclear location to the plasma membrane. These results suggested that each β subunit was able to form complexes with the α1C subunit in a manner similar to that observed with the β2apalmitoylation-deficient mutant, confirming that the palmitoylation of the β subunits was not required for membrane targeting of calcium channel complexes when co-expressed with the α1Csubunit. The finding that each β subunit caused a similar redistribution of the α1Csubunit to the plasma membrane suggested that a structural domain common to each β subunit might be important. All four different β subunits discovered to date (including numerous splicing variants) contain a conserved central region with two highly homologous domains (3Perez-Reyes E. Schneider T. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1111-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Within this region, a site that mediates interaction with various α1 subunits has been identified and termed the β-interaction domain (BID) (16De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 22De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Pragnell M. Liu H. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12056-12064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, it has not been demonstrated whether the conserved core region of the β2subunit is sufficient for membrane targeting of the α1Cβ2 complex. To test this possibility, an N- and C-terminal truncation mutant of the rat β2asubunit, β2aΔNC, containing only the conserved core region, was created and transfected into HEK-tsA cells. An intracellular staining pattern of this minimal β subunit was observed when this truncation mutant was expressed alone (data not shown). This finding was consistent with the fact that the N-terminal palmitoylation sites (membrane-anchoring sites) were deleted from this truncation mutant (19Chien A.J. Gao T. Perez-Reyes E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23590-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To study the membrane targeting function of β2aΔNC, the α1C and β2aΔNC subunits were co-expressed in tsA cells, and the expression pattern of the α1C subunit was revealed using the Card C antibody. Clusters of α1C subunits were observed as bright punctate spots on the cell surface, as shown in the confocal image generated from a top section of the cell (Fig.3, top panel). A confocal image taken from the middle section of the cell showed punctate formation of channel complexes along the cell plasma membranes (Fig. 3, top panel). These staining patterns were similar to those seen in Figs. 1 and 2. The ability of the β2aΔNC subunit to allow targeting of the α1Cβ2 complex to the cell plasma membranes indicated that the conserved core region of β subunits was sufficient for the targeting of the α1C·β complexes. Taken together, these results suggested that the membrane targeting observed in the presence of all β subunits can be achieved with only the conserved region. However, the unique electrophysiological properties of calcium channels that have been observed upon co-expression of different β isoforms were probably determined by distinctive N- and C-terminal regions (1De Waard M. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. Ion Channels. 1996; 4: 41-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 20Qin N. Platano D. Olcese R. Costantin J.L. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): 102Google Scholar). The results presented so far suggested that the signal for membrane targeting of the α1C and β subunits generated upon formation of α1C·β complexes, since membrane targeting was achieved in most instances with subunits that exhibited an intracellular distribution when expressed alone. If this is true, then mutations that disrupt subunit interaction should disrupt membrane targeting. Electrophysiological studies in Xenopus oocytes, as well as studies with fusion proteins, have suggested that the BID in the conserved domains of β subunits is critical for αβ subunit interaction (16De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Mutation of Pro237 to Arg in the BID of the β1b subunit appeared to completely eliminate α1β interaction (16De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, studies with"

Purified recombinant ERAB/HADH II catalyzed the NADH-dependent reduction of S-acetoacetyl-CoA with a K m of ≈68 μm and aV max of ≈430 μmol/min/mg. The contribution of ERAB/HADH II enzymatic activity to Aβ-mediated cellular dysfunction was studied by site-directed mutagenesis in the catalytic domain (Y168G/K172G). Although COS cells cotransfected to overexpress wild-type ERAB/HADH II and variant β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP(V717G)) showed DNA fragmentation, cotransfection with Y168G/K172G-altered ERAB and βAPP(V717G) was without effect. We thus asked whether the enzyme might recognize alcohol substrates of which the aldehyde products could be cytotoxic; ERAB/HADH II catalyzed oxidation of a variety of simple alcohols (C2–C10) to their respective aldehydes in the presence of NAD+ and NAD-dependent oxidation of 17β-estradiol. Addition of micromolar levels of synthetic Aβ(1–40) to purified ERAB/HADH II inhibited, in parallel, reduction of S-acetoacetyl-CoA (K i ≈ 1.6 μm), as well as oxidation of 17β-estradiol (K i ≈3.2 μm) and (−)-2-octanol (K i ≈ 2.6 μm). Because micromolar levels of Aβ were required to inhibit ERAB/HADH II activity, whereas Aβ binding to ERAB/HADH II occurred at much lower concentrations (K m ≈ 40–70 nm), the latter more closely simulating Aβ levels within cells, Aβ perturbation of ERAB/HADH II was likely to result from mechanisms other than the direct modulation of enzymatic activity. Cells cotransfected to overexpress ERAB/HADH II and βAPP(V717G) generated malondialdehyde-protein and 4-hydroxynonenal-protein epitopes, which were detectable only at the lowest levels in cells overexpressing either ERAB/HADH II or βAPP(V717G) alone. Generation of such toxic aldehydes was not observed in cells contransfected to overexpress Y168G/K172G-altered ERAB and βAPP(V717G).

Another potential cellular interaction site is the endoplasmic reticulum-associated Aβ-binding protein, initially designated ERAB and first identified using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for species that bound Aβ (15Yan S.-D.

ERAB was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria in cultured cells (15Yan S.-D. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Roher A.

Its expression was found to be increased in AD brain, and, in vitro, ERAB facilitated Aβ cytotoxicity in neuroblastoma and transfected COS cells. Our initial analysis of the ERAB amino acid sequence showed resemblance to the family of short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases, including hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, Ke6, and acetoacetyl coenzyme A (CoA) reductases (16Schembri M. Bayly R. Davies J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4501-4507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggested a primary role for ERAB in cell metabolism, in addition to having the potential to contribute to Aβ-induced cytotoxicity. The bovine counterpart of ERAB was recently isolated from liver mitochondrial preparations, and characterized as the mitochondrial 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase type II (HADH II) (E.C. 1.1.1.35) (17Furuta S.

The designation ERAB/HADH II is used to emphasize the properties of ERAB with respect to binding of Aβ and potentiation of Aβ toxicity, as well as its metabolic function as a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. We propose to rename the enzyme Aβ binding alcohol dehydrogenase as this reflects both its capacity to bind Aβ and its activity as a generalized alcohol dehydrogenase (see text). 2ERAB was the name applied to HADH II before their identity was ascertained.

These patients have hepatomegaly, cardiomegaly, encephalopathies, peripheral neuropathy, rhabdomyolysis, and myoglobinuria, suggesting a role for fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes in the metabolic balance of a range of organs. To investigate whether the enzymatic activity of ERAB/HADH II was correlated with its interaction with Aβ and cytotoxicity, we have further characterized this protein. We find that it has the ability to catalyze the oxidation of alcohol groups in a range of substrates, including linear alcohols and estradiol, as well as the reduction ofS-acetoacetyl-CoA. To analyze the role of ERAB/HADH II enzymatic activity in potentiation of Aβ toxicity, a catalytically crippled form was prepared containing two substitutions in the highly conserved sequence of residues 168–172 (YSASK), putatively assigned as part of the active center of the enzyme (16Schembri M. Bayly R. Davies J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4501-4507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells overexpressing mutant ERAB were relatively protected from Aβ cytotoxicity consequent to overexpression of mutant βAPP(V717G), as demonstrated by suppression of apoptosis. In contrast, cells overexpressing both wild-type ERAB/HADH II and βAPP (V717G) suffered increased cytotoxicity. Thus, it appears that activity of the enzyme is necessary for full toxicity. In cells overexpressing ERAB/HADH II and βAPP(V717G), the intracellular distribution of ERAB/HADH II was altered, and generation of reactive aldehydes, including malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal, occurred. Such reactive aldehydes provide a barometer of oxidant cell stress (22Rosenfeld M. Palinski W. Herttula S. Butler S. Witztum J.

These data lead us to propose that enzymatically active ERAB/HADH II, an alcohol dehydrogenase with broad substrate specificity, may have a role in metabolic homeostasis but can switch to a pathologic role in an Aβ-rich environment, as in AD, potentiating cell stress and cytotoxicity. Escherichia coli (BL21) was transformed with pGE5-human ERAB/HADH II or mutant forms of ERAB/HADH II, prepared as described below. Transformants were induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, and cell extracts were prepared by cell disruption. Extracts were subjected to cation exchange FPLC chromatography on SP Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and on Source 15S, followed by gel filtration on Superdex 200. The extract from ∼1 liter of bacterial culture was applied to 2 ml of SP Sepharose in 25 mm MES (pH 6.0), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol. The resin was washed with equilibration buffer and eluted with an ascending linear salt gradient (0.1–1.0 m NaCl). ERAB/HADH II, detected by its migration on SDS-PAGE and by immunoblotting (see below), eluted in fractions corresponding to 0.15–0.4 mNaCl. These fractions were pooled, diluted 6-fold, and applied to Source 15S resin in 0.1 m MES (pH 6.0)/0.1 mNaCl (5 mg of protein per 1 ml of resin). The column was eluted with an ascending salt gradient, and ERAB/HADH II emerged at ≈0.15m NaCl. ERAB/HADH II-rich fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration to ≈15 mg/ml and loaded onto a Superdex 200 (30/10) column (1 ml was applied to the column for each run). Peak fractions from Superdex 200 were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12%) and immunoblotting. Immunodetection of ERAB/HADH II employed as primary antibody either anti-ERAB peptide IgG (15Yan S.-D. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Roher A. Stern D.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1988Google Scholar), using full-length recombinant human ERAB/HADH II as the immunogen. IgG was purified from rabbit antisera by chromatography on Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sites of primary antibody binding were visualized with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). The ERAB/HADH II immunoreactive band migrated with ≈27 kDa, consistent with previous observations (15Yan S.-D. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M.

N-terminal sequencing of wild-type and mutant forms of ERAB/HADH II was performed on a Porton 2090 E gas phase protein sequencer (Beckman) equipped with an on-line Hewlett-Packard 1090 HPLC. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to mutate tyrosine (168) and/or lysine (172) to glycine using a kit from Promega (Madison, WI). ERAB/HADH II was studied for its activity to reduceS-acetoacetyl-CoA, as well as its capacity to dehydrogenate alcohol groups in a range of linear alcohols and in estradiol. The assay for reduction of S-acetoacetyl-CoA employed ERAB/HADH II (333 ng/ml), a range of S-acetoacetyl-CoA concentrations (0.0015–0.36 mm; Sigma), and NADH (0.1 mm; Sigma) in 97 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.3). The reaction was run for a total of 2 h at 25 °C under steady-state conditions (34Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics, Behavior, and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. Wiley-Interscience, New York1975Google Scholar), and the change in NADH absorbance at 340 nm was determined every 5 min. Alcohol dehydrogenase assays employed ERAB/HADH II (20 μg/ml), a range of alcohol substrates and concentrations (methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol,n-butanol, isobutanol, n-pentanol, (±)-2-octanol, (+)-2-octanol, (−)-2-octanol, andn-decanol; Sigma), and NAD+ (7.5 mm) in 22 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.3 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.8). The reaction was run for 2 h at 25 °C, and the absorbance at 340 nm was monitored every 5 min as described above. Studies to evaluate oxidation of 17β-estradiol employed ERAB/HADH II (30 μg/ml), a range of 17β-estradiol concentrations (3.8–92 μm), and NAD+ (0.4 mm) in 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate (pH 8.9) at 25 °C for 2 h. Where indicated, freshly prepared synthetic Aβ(1–40) or Aβ(1–42), either obtained from California Peptide Inc. (Napa, CA) and purified by reversed-phase and size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography (purity was confirmed by mass spectrometry, amino acid analysis and peptide mapping) or purchased in purified form from QCB (Hopkinton, MA) was added to the reaction mixture. Aβ(1–40) was freshly prepared and dissolved in distilled water. Aβ(1–42) was also freshly prepared and dissolved in Me2SO. The final concentration of Me2SO was <1%, and control experiments using this concentration of Me2SO alone (i.e. without Aβ(1–42)) had no effect on the reactions under study. Kinetic data were analyzed by PRISM (Scitech, San Diego, CA) to determineK m, V max, andK i, and lines shown in the figures represent theoretical curves according to kinetic parameters calculated by the program. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as that converting 1.0 μmol of substrate to product per min. For K i, a one-site competitive inhibition model was used (34Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics, Behavior, and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. Wiley-Interscience, New York1975Google Scholar). Binding of ERAB/HADH II to Aβ was studied using125I-labeled purified recombinant ERAB/HADH II (15Yan S.-D. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Roher A. Stern D. Nature. 1997; 389: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The protein was labeled by the Iodobead method to a final specific radioactivity of ≈2000 cpm/ng (an average of five labelings) and the tracer was >90% precipitable in trichloroacetic acid (10%). Wells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with Aβ(1–40) diluted into carbonate buffer (0.1 m; pH 9.6). Excess sites in the well were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C. Wells were aspirated, and binding buffer (minimal essential medium containing fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml; 0.05 ml) was added with125I-ERAB/HADH II alone or in the presence of 100-fold excess unlabeled ERAB/HADH II. Binding was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37 °C, and each well was washed four times (0.2 ml/wash) over 30 s with ice cold phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (0.05%). Bound tracer was eluted with Nonidet P-40 (1%) over 5 min at 37 °C. Specific binding was defined as total minus nonspecific binding. Total binding was that observed in the presence of tracer alone. Nonspecific binding was that observed with tracer in the presence of 100-fold excess unlabeled ERAB/HADH II. Binding experiments were performed with four replicates per concentration of tracer. Data were analyzed by nonlinear least squares analysis (Enzfitter) using a one-site model by the method of Klotz and Hunston (35Klotz I. Hunston D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10060-10062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfection of COS-1 or neuroblastoma (N115) cells (ATCC) employed pcDNA3/human ERAB/HADH II (wild-type or mutant forms) using LipofectAMINE according to previously described methods (15Yan S.-D. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Roher A. Stern D. Nature. 1997; 389: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Where indicated, cultures were subjected to transient transfection with pAdlox/βAPP(V717G). The latter was made by inserting a construct encoding βAPP(V717G) (36Wild-Bode C. Yamazaki T. Capell A. Leimer U. Steiner H. Ihara Y. Haass C. J. Biol.

Sassoon D. Kitajewski J. Development. 1996; 122: 2251-2259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, a construct encoding wild-type (wt) βAPP(1–695) was inserted into the SalI cloning sites of the pMT vector (38Bonthron D. Handin R. Kaufman R. Wasley L. Orr E. Mitsock L. Ewenstein B. Loscalzo J. Ginsburg D. Orkin S.

The effect of ERAB/HADH II on cellular properties was determined in the absence and the presence of an Aβ-rich environment (the latter provided by transfection with pAdlox/βAPP(V717G)). COS and neuroblastoma cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3/ERAB with or without pAdlox/βAPP(V717G) were assayed for evidence of DNA fragmentation using the ELISA for cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (Cell Death ELISA; Boehringer Mannheim) and the TUNEL assay (Boehringer Mannheim). Similar experiments were performed employing pMT/wtβAPP in place of βAPP(V717G). In order to determine the relative apoptosis index (RAI) (15Yan S.-D. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Roher A. Stern D. Nature. 1997; 389: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), cells were also evaluated for expression of ERAB/HADH II or βAPP immunocytochemically (cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40) using primary antibodies to each antigen and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) as the secondary antibody, (because both primary antibodies were prepared in rabbits, ERAB/HADH II and βAPP were detected separately in duplicate cultures; the TUNEL assay was performed on the same cultures in which ERAB/HADH II or βAPP was visualized. Subcellular localization of ERAB/HADH II employed ultracentrifugation of disrupted cells and confocal microscopy. Cells (5 × 108) were transfected as above, and, 12 h later, cells were pelletted and fractionated as described (40Kuwabara K. Matsumoto M. Ikeda J. Hori J. Ogawa S. Maeda Y. Kitagawa K. Imuta N.

In brief, cell pellets frozen at −80 °C were thawed, resuspended in 10 ml of Buffer A (0.25 m sucrose; 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin; 0.1 mm1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone), and cavitated at 400 p.s.i. for 30 min using a nitrogen cavitation bomb apparatus (Kontes Glass Co., Vineland, NJ). Following cell disruption, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 1% Nonidet P-40; 150 mmNaCl; 1 mm EDTA; 10 μg/ml aprotinin; 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The latter material was centrifuged and fractionated through a series of sucrose steps (38, 30, and 20% sucrose prepared in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5; 1 mmdithiothreitol) at 100,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C. Layered fractions (fractions 1–4) were collected by puncturing the tube at the desired depth and gently withdrawing the fluid. The pellet at the bottom of the tube was resuspended in 3 ml of Buffer A (precipitate fraction, termed fraction 5). Following determination of protein content, each fraction (5 μg protein/lane) was subjected to Western blotting using anti-ERAB/HADH II IgG. Enrichment of cellular structures/organelles in subcellular fractions was identified by the presence of marker proteins: RAGE (control cultures were transfected with pcDNA3/RAGE that was detected by Western blotting using specific antibodies to RAGE (10Yan S.-D.

The mitochondria-rich fraction was also prepared using the method of Du et al. (41Du Y. Dodel R. Bales K. Jemerson R. Hamilton-Byrd E. Paul S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy (Zeiss) employed rabbit anti-human ERAB/HADH II IgG, monoclonal antibody to protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (StressGen) and a specific marker for mitochondria (Mito-TrackerTM Red CMXRos, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For detection of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) epitopes, murine monoclonal anti-MDA-lysine IgG (1 μg/ml; MDA2) and murine monoclonal anti-HNE-lysine IgG (1 μg/ml; NA59) were used, respectively (22Rosenfeld M.

https://openalex.org/W2041082867,"Stable transfectants of PC12 cells expressing bcl-2 or crmA were generated and tested for their susceptibility to various apoptotic insults. Bcl-2 expression conferred resistance to apoptosis induced by staurosporine and by oxidative insults including hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite, but was less effective in inhibition of activation-induced programmed cell death induced by concanavalin A. Concanavalin A-induced apoptosis was abated, however, in cells expressing very high levels of bcl-2. In contrast, cells expressing crmA were protected from concanavalin A-induced apoptosis, but were as susceptible as control cells to apoptosis induced by staurosporine and oxidative insults. Therefore, at least two apoptotic pathways in PC12 cells can be discerned by their differential sensitivity to blockade by bcl-2 and crmA. The ability of β-amyloid (Aβ) to induce apoptosis in these cells was assessed. CrmA transfectants were protected from apoptosis induced by Aβ1–42, but only cells expressing very high levels of bcl-2 were similarly protected. These results suggest that the apoptotic pathway activated by Aβ1–42 in PC12 cells can be differentiated from the apoptotic pathway activated by oxidative insults. Gene transfer experiments also demonstrated that expression of crmA in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons is protective against cell death induced by Aβ1–42. Together these results support the hypothesis that Aβ-induced apoptosis occurs through activation-induced programmed cell death."

Nonesterified CoA is the most potent inhibitor of bPanK in vitro and in vivo, whereas acetyl-CoA is about 20% as effective as CoA (21Vallari D.S. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1993; 301: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) PanK enzymes. Although both CoA and acetyl-CoA are reported to inhibit these enzymes, in general, acetyl-CoA is more effective than CoA. The goal of the present study was to extend the molecular and biochemical characterization of PanK to eukaryotic cells. Homologs ofE. coli bPanK protein and the coaA gene (accession no. M90071) are clearly detected in the genomes ofHemophilus influenzae (accession no. U32746),Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TIGR gmt7548), Vibrio cholerae (TIGR GVCCS17R), Streptococcus pyogenes(OUACGT Contig282), and Bacillus subtilis (accession no.D84432) using standard search and sequence alignment tools. In contrast, a similar search of the Saccharomyces cerevisiaegenome data base did not reveal the presence of a predicted protein with significant sequence similarity to the E. coli bPanK protein or the nucleotide sequence of the coaA gene. Also, sequences related to bPanK could not be identified in the mammalian expressed sequence-tagged data base. These results indicated that eukaryotic cells possess a PanK with a significantly dissimilar primary structure. Therefore, we employed a genetic selection strategy to clone a PanK gene from an A. nidulans cDNA library by functional complementation of the coaA15(Ts) mutant ofE. coli. This paper describes the isolation and characterization of a eukaryotic PanK with a distinctly different primary structure and dissimilar regulatory properties compared with its prokaryotic counterpart.

Strain ts9 (leuB6 hisG1 argG6 metB1 rplL9 rts-1 ilu-1 lacY1 gal-6 xyl-7 mtl-2 malA1 tonA2 tsx-1 λRλ− supE44) (25Flaks J.G. Leboy S. Birge E.A. Kurland C.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1966; 31: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was obtained from the Coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale University. Strain ts9 was conditionally defective and did not grow at 42 °C. Complementation of the temperature-sensitive rts-1 allele by the coaA gene (pWS7-13-2) encoding E. coli PanK permitted phosphopantothenate and CoA biosynthesis (17Song W.-J. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1705-1706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Song W.-J. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6411-6417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain ts9 also exhibited a temperature-sensitive growth requirement for isoleucine because of the defect in the ilv-1 allele. Strain DV73 (coaA15 srl::Tn10 recA metB1 relA1 spoT1 gyrA216 λ− λRF−) was unable to synthesize phosphopantothenate and CoA at 42 °C because of a specific defect in the coaA15allele that encoded a temperature-sensitive (bPanK) protein (16Vallari D.S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5795-5800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rich medium was Luria broth (26Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and minimal medium consisted of medium E salts (26Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with glucose (0.4%), thiamine (0.001%), and required amino acids (0.01%). Agar (1.5%) was added to media formulations for plating. The ampicillin concentration was 50 μg/ml when indicated. An A. nidulans cDNA library was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions using the ZAP-cDNA library kit from Stratagene. Messenger RNA (5.1 μg) was isolated from wild-typeA. nidulans strain G1071 (completely prototrophic) grown onA. nidulans minimal medium with 10 mm sodium nitrate as the sole nitrogen source and in the absence of vitamins (7MacCabe A.P. van Liempt H. Palissa H. Unkles S.E. Riach M.B.R. Pfeifer E. von Döhren H. Kinghorn J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12646-12654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Excision of the λ-ZAP yielded 2.5 × 108 phagemids in 30 μg of DNA. E. coli strain ts9 was electroporated (2,500 volts, capacitance 25 microfarads, pulse time 4.88 ms) with 0.5 μg of the excised cDNA library and incubated at 23 °C for 2 h. Transformants were plated onto Luria broth agar plus ampicillin at 37 °C. Plasmid pWS7-13-2 encoding the E. coli bPanK was the transformation and phenotypic positive control. Recombinant A. nidulans phagemid λSTA1999 was digested with KpnI and SpeI, and the 450-base pair fragment was separated from the 1.5-kb and 2.9-kb vector sequences by gel electrophoresis in 1% agarose. The fragment was purified using a GeneClean II kit and then used as template for preparation of a radiolabeled probe together with [32P]dCTP, dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and Klenow fragment. Southern blots prepared from A. nidulans chromosomes I–VIII (Fungal Genetic Stock Center) were hybridized with the probe. Blots were washed at 25 °C in 2 × saline sodium citrate and exposed overnight at −70 °C. Hybridizing cosmids were purified, digested with EcoRV, EcoRV plus XhoI, or BamHI plus BglII, and transferred to Zeta-Probe membrane for rescreening. The membrane was then hybridized with the KpnI/SpeI fragment of phagemid λSTA1999 and washed at 65 °C in 1 × saline sodium citrate. One of the four positive cosmids, W19B06 (34C5), was purified using a Qiagen P100 column and digested with a number of restriction enzymes. Genomic DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted onto Zeta-Probe membrane, and probed with theKpnI/SpeI fragment derived from phagemid λSTA1999. The probe hybridized with a 5.0/5.1-kb doublet band from anXbaI digest of the cosmid. The two genomic DNA fragments were separated, purified, and subcloned into pUC18 that had been digested with XbaI. Hybridization of the two genomic DNA fragments with the A. nidulans phagemid λSTA1999 cDNA fragment identified the 5.1-kb clone (plasmid pSTA2000) as containing the genomic DNA corresponding to the gene designated panK. The genomic DNA (pSTA2000) and cDNA (λSTA1999) sequences were determined on both strands by automated DNA sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 373A automated fluorescent sequencing apparatus and a PRISM Ready Reaction dideoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) with primers at a concentration of 10 μm and 0.5 μg of pSTA2000 as template. Sequences were assembled using Sequencher (Gene Codes Corp.). The cDNA sequence of panK was verified independently by automated DNA sequencing at the Molecular Resource Center of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Cultures of the wild-type A. nidulans strain GO51 (carrying the biotin auxotrophic markerbia1) were grown at 30 °C for 16 h in liquid minimal medium containing 5 mm ammonium tartrate or 10 mm sodium nitrate as sole nitrogen source (27Cove D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 113: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with or without a final concentration of 1 μg/ml pantothenate. Total RNA was extracted from mycelium as described previously (28MacCabe A.P. Riach M.B.R. Unkles S.E. Kinghorn J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and mRNA prepared using a Quick Prep mRNA purification kit. Northern blot analysis was carried out as described previously (28MacCabe A.P. Riach M.B.R. Unkles S.E. Kinghorn J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) using a 2-kbBamHI fragment of pSTA2000. The panK cDNA gene fromAspergillus was amplified from phagemid λSTA1999, encoding aPanK. The forward primer created a novel restriction site forNdeI at the amino-terminal methionine and removed an internal BamHI site (5′-GTCATATGTCCGCCACTGATCCTACTC-3′). The reverse primer introduced a BamHI site downstream of the stop codon (5′-AGGATCCGGTTGCCGCCTAAGCTCAT-3′). A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using Advantage cDNA polymerase mix (CLONTECH), and the product was ligated into the TA cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli One Shot cells (Invitrogen). After overnight growth, plasmid was isolated from the ampicillin-resistant population of cells and digested with NdeI andBamHI, and the appropriate fragment was gel purified by QIAquick (Qiagen). The purified fragment was ligated intoNdeI and BamHI digested pET-15b (Novagen) treated with alkaline calf intestinal phosphatase. This ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen), and ampicillin-resistant transformants were screened for the correct insertion by PCR. The E. coli coaA gene encoding bPanK was amplified by PCR from pWS7-13-2. A forward primer (5′-CATATGAGTATAAAAGATCAAACG-3′) introduced aNdeI site at the first translational start and and also introduced a mutation (E5D) that removed an internal ribosomal binding site to reduce the occurrence of shorter transcripts. A reverse primer (5′-GGATCCGAGTATTCGCTCCCCTGCAA-3′) added a BamHI site for subcloning. The PCR was performed using the Advantage cDNA polymerase mix (CLONTECH), and the product was ligated into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The ligation mixture was transformed into One Shot cells (Invitrogen). After overnight growth on ampicillin selection medium, plasmid DNA was isolated from a mixture of cells and digested with NdeI and BamHI. The appropriate fragment was gel purified and isolated by QIAquick (Qiagen). The purified DNA fragment was ligated into NdeI- andBamHI-digested pET-15b (Novagen) treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. This ligation mixture was used to transform strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen), and transformants were screened for ampicillin resistance and by PCR for the presence of thecoaA insert in the plasmid vector. Single colonies were isolated and cultured to mid-log phase, frozen at −70 °C in the presence of 7% dimethyl sulfoxide, and screened for overexpression of bPanK protein by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after IPTG induction. Plasmids were recovered from several clonal cultures that overexpressed the His-tagged protein of the appropriate molecular size. These plasmids were each transformed into strain DH5α for subsequent plasmid purification and DNA sequencing to verify the amino acid sequence of the bPanK protein encoded by the plasmid. Colonies were grown to mid-log phase and frozen at −70 °C in the presence of 7% dimethyl sulfoxide and tested for their ability to overexpress a protein of the appropriate size after IPTG induction. Overnight cultures were prepared as a series of 1:100 dilutions made directly from the thawed freeze down; the following morning, cultures in early-mid log phase were added to 500 ml of LB and grown to a density of approximately 5 × 108cells/ml. IPTG was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and incubation was continued for a further 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation in a JA-10 rotor (8,000 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min) and stored at −20 °C overnight. The cells were lysed by the addition of 1 mg/ml DNase and lysozyme plus 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were then frozen at −70 °C for 2 h, thawed on ice, and the soluble extract was isolated by centrifugation in a Ti 45 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 3 h. The aPanK or the bPanK His-tagged fusion protein was purified in one step on a Ni-NTA agarose resin (Qiagen) by the same procedure. The affinity matrix (15 ml) was charged with NiSO4 by sequentially washing with 60 ml of water, 60 ml of 2 mmNiSO4, and 90 ml of binding buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, plus 0.5 m NaCl). The activated support was mixed with the cell extract for 45 min at 4 °C and then packed into a column. The column was washed successively with 150 ml of the binding buffer followed by 150 ml of the binding buffer containing 0.04m imidazole. Bound protein was eluted with 150 ml of binding buffer containing 0.2 m imidazole. The fractions containing His-tagged aPanK or bPanK were combined and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA and concentrated using an Amicon stirred cell followed by a Centricon-30 concentrator. The purified proteins were stored at −20 °C in the presence of 50% glycerol. The purity of the protein preparations was assessed by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Enzyme preparation and assays were performed as described previously (21Vallari D.S. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2468-2471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PanK specific activities in cell lysates were calculated as a function of protein concentration. Assays were linear with respect to both time and protein input. Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214321) Google Scholar) with γ-globulin as a standard. Standard assays containedd-[1-14C]pantothenate (45.5 μm; specific activity 55 mCi/mmol), ATP (2.5 mm, pH 7.0), MgCl2 (2.5 mm), Tris-HCl (0.1 m, pH 7.5), and 32 μg of protein from a 35–60% ammonium sulfate fraction in a total volume of 40 μl. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by depositing a 30-μl aliquot onto a Whatmann DE81 ion exchange filter disc that was washed in three changes of 1% acetic acid in 95% ethanol (25 ml/disc) to remove unreacted pantothenate. 4′-Phosphopantothenate was quantitated by counting the dried disk in 3 ml of scintillation solution. A cDNA expression library was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” from wild-type A. nidulans, prototrophic strain G1071. The library was transformed into the E. coli strain ts9, which carried a conditionally defective rts allele (25Flaks J.G. Leboy S. Birge E.A. Kurland C.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1966; 31: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and exhibited poor growth at 37 °C. Selection for growth of the transformants at 37 °C yielded colonies that harbored library phagemids that functionally complemented the defect. Three phagemids were purified and retransformed into eitherE. coli strains ts9 or DV73. Strain DV73 harbored the defective coaA15 allele, which expressed a temperature-sensitive bPanK (16Vallari D.S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5795-5800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The coaA andrts genes are allelic (17Song W.-J. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1705-1706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phagemid designated λSTA1999 complemented the temperature-sensitive growth defect in both bacterial mutants on rich medium, albeit yielding slightly smaller colony diameters than the control colonies arising from transformation with the positive control plasmid, pWS7-13-2, expressing the E. coli coaA gene. Limited growth of strain DV73 (coaA15(Ts)) on rich medium at 42 °C is often observed because of a large preexisting CoA pool coupled with the high level of amino acid supplementation (16Vallari D.S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5795-5800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 866-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, transformation of strain DV73 with phagemid λSTA1999 was repeated, and ampicillin-resistant colonies were selected at the permissive temperature, 30 °C. Subsequently, 48 colonies were scored for the temperature-dependent growth phenotype on glucose-minimal medium at 42 °C. All 48 colonies grew at the nonpermissive temperature, verifying that complementation was not caused by reversion of the host strain phenotype. These data clearly indicated that the A. nidulans cDNA expressed from phagemid λSTA1999 encoded the functional equivalent of an active pantothenate kinase. The Aspergillus cDNA insert in phagemid λSTA1999 was used to screen a bank of genomic clones representing A. nidulans chromosomes I–VIII obtained from the Fungal Genetic Stock Center as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Genomic DNA was blotted onto membranes and hybridized with a32P-labeled probe derived from the 450-base pairKpnI/SpeI fragment of phagemid λSTA1999. Positive cosmids from the first screen were identified as W19B06, W21A12, W21H08, W23E02, W23D11, W24H12, and W24H03 from chromosome III. Cosmid W19B06 (34C5) was digested with a panel of restriction enzymes, and the fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and blotted onto membranes. Hybridization with the 450-base pair λSTA1999 probe signaled a region of the gel containing a 5.0/5.1-kb doublet from an XbaI digest. Purification of the two DNA bands and reprobing identified the 5.1-kb fragment as containing the genomic sequences for the cDNA insertion in phagemid λSTA1999. The gene for A. nidulans pantothenate kinase (aPanK) was designatedpanK, and the genomic fragment containing this gene was subcloned to yield plasmid pSTA2000. The DNA sequence of the aPanK cDNA and a 2115-base pair stretch of plasmid pSTA2000 encompassing the panK gene was determined on both strands (Fig. 1). The panK gene contained a single open reading frame interrupted by three short introns typical of those found in fungi (31Gurr S.J. Unkles S.E. Kinghorn J.R. Kinghorn J.R. Gene Structure in Eukaryotic Microbes. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 93-139Google Scholar). The positions of the introns were confirmed by comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences. Although we have not directly determined the amino-terminal protein sequence for aPanK, the putative translational start is the first methionine codon of the open reading frame. There was an in-frame stop codon located 7 codons upstream of the predicted methionine start codon. The size of the expressed aPanK protein (see below) confirms this Met as the start site as the next methionine residue is located 154 amino acids downstream. The site of polyadenylation is approximately 508 nucleotides downstream from the translational stop codon and is indicated by the arrow in Fig. 1. However, the precise polyadenylation acceptor could not be determined simply by comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences because there is a stretch of 6 A nucleotides in the genomic sequence at this point. An AATAAA polyadenylation signal is located 21 nucleotides upstream from the proposed polyadenylation site. Northern blot analysis of mRNA prepared from A. nidulansindicated that the panK gene was transcribed as a single mRNA (Fig. 2 A). The apparent size of the panK transcript, 1.85 kb, was consistent with the size predicted from the analysis of the genomic and cDNA sequences (Fig. 1). The transcript occurred in approximately the same abundance in cells grown with either ammonium or nitrate as the nitrogen source, in the presence or absence of pantothenate, and the level of panK transcript was much lower that that ofA. nidulans actin (data not shown). The predicted protein sequence of aPanK consisted of 420 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 46.9 kDa. This sequence was used to perform a similarity search against the S. cerevisiae genome data base. This search identified a predicted open reading frame (Ydr531w) that consisted of 367 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 40.9 kDa. The Ydr531w open reading frame was 44.8% identical and 60.2% similar to the aPanK sequence (Fig. 3). Based on this strong similarity the Ydr532w open reading frame is predicted to encode the yeast pantothenate kinase (yPanK). The major difference between aPanK and yPanK was in the amino-terminal domain, which was significantly longer in aPanK. We detected only a single PanK isoform in the S. cerevisiae genome. The similarity between aPanK and the previously described bPanK fromE. coli was far less striking (Fig. 3). bPanK is a protein composed of 316 amino acids with a molecular mass of 36.4 kDa. bPanK was 16.2% identical and and 32.9% similar to aPanK. These calculations were based on the introduction of several significant gaps in the bPanK sequence to align the smaller bacterial protein with the larger aPanK. Nonetheless, the comparison between bPanK and aPanK/yPanK points to the location of the ATP binding site in aPanK/yPanK. Lysine 101 is a critical residue in bPanK required for the binding of both the ATP substrate and the CoA regulators to the enzyme (20Song W.-J. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27051-27058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Lys-101 residue in bPanK corresponds to Lys-141 in aPanK and Lys-85 in yPanK as indicated in Fig. 3, suggesting that these lysine residues may be involved in nucleotide binding in the aPanK and yPanK proteins. The functional complementation by phagemid λSTA1999 coupled with the cDNA/genomic DNA sequence analysis strongly indicated that theApergillus panK gene encoded a functional PanK. This point was tested by assaying extracts from strain DV73 (coaA15(Ts)) transformed with phagemid λSTA1999 for PanK activity. Because strain DV73 had a temperature-sensitive bPanK (16Vallari D.S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5795-5800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), extracts from strain DV73 transformed with the empty control plasmid possessed a low background PanK specific activity. Transformation of strain DV73 with phagemid λSTA1999 resulted in a dramatic increase in PanK activity in the soluble fractions of the cells (data not shown). These results were consistent"
https://openalex.org/W1971152401,"The breast and ovarian specific tumor suppressor protein, BRCA1, has been shown to be a transcription factor because its carboxyl terminus, when fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain, activates gene expression in cells. In this study, purified GAL4-BRCA1 protein functions in transcriptional activation assays using a minimal in vitro system. When compared with a standard activator, GAL4-VP16, the levels of activation produced by the BRCA1 fusion protein were stronger when in the presence of certain coactivators. The transcriptional activation by BRCA1 is maximal when in the presence of the PC4 (positive component 4) coactivator but not HMG2 (high mobility group protein 2) and when the template is negatively supercoiled. By contrast, transcriptional activation by VP16 was highest in the presence of HMG2 as well as PC4 and when DNA templates had linear topology. Activation by VP16 was largely unaffected by the concentration of TFIIH, whereas activation by BRCA1 was strongly affected by TFIIH concentrations. The differing cofactor and template requirements suggest that GAL4-BRCA1 and GAL4-VP16 regulate different steps in the pathways that lead to transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W2047368739,"Distal pocket mutants of sperm whale oxymyoglobin (oxy-Mb) were reacted with a 2.5-fold excess of hydrogen peroxide (HOOH) in phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, 37 °C. We describe a mechanism composed of three distinct steps: 1) initial oxidation of oxy- to ferryl-Mb, 2) autoreduction of the ferryl intermediate to ferric metmyoglobin (metMb), and 3) reaction of metMb with an additional HOOH molecule to regenerate the ferryl intermediate creating a pseudoperoxidase catalytic cycle. Mutation of Leu-29(B10) to Phe slows the initial oxidation reaction 3-fold but has little effect on the rate of ferryl reduction to ferric met-aquo-myoglobin. In contrast, the Val-68(E11) to Phe mutation causes a small, 60% increase in the initial oxidation reaction and a much larger 2.5-fold increase in the rate of autoreduction. Double insertion of Phe at both the B10- and E11-positions (L29F/V68F) produces a mutant with oxidation characteristics of both single mutants, slow initial oxidation, and rapid autoreduction, but an extraordinarily high affinity for O2. Replacing His-64(E7) with Gln produces 3–4-fold increases in both processes. Combining the mutation H64Q with L29F results in a myoglobin with enhanced resistance to metMb formation in the absence of antioxidant enzymes (i.e. catalase and superoxide dismutase) due to its own high pseudoperoxidase activity, which rapidly removes any HOOH produced in the initial stages of autoxidation. This double substitution occurs naturally in the myoglobin of Asian elephants, and similar multiple replacements have been used to reduce selectively the rate of nitric oxide (NO)-induced oxidation of both recombinant MbO2 and HbO2blood substitute prototypes without altering O2affinity."

Peptides representing the potential phosphorylation sites within the cytoplasmic domain of CD22 have been used to stimulate SHP-1 catalytic activity and to inhibit the binding of SHP-1 to CD22 (Doody, G., Justement, L., Delibrias, C., Matthews, R., Lin, J., Thomas, M., and Fearon, D. (1995) Science 269, 242–244). However, the sites of phosphorylation within the cytoplasmic domain of CD22 and the importance of each for the recruitment and activation of SHP-1 remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that there are multiple sites within the cytoplasmic domain of CD22 that interact with the Src homology 2 domains of SHP-1. Nevertheless, a minimum of two tyrosines in CD22 is required for the association with SHP-1. Furthermore, both Src homology 2 domains of SHP-1 are necessary for efficient binding to CD22.

Indeed, it has been shown that CD22 binds to multiple enzymes including Syk, p53/56lyn (Lyn), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase Cγ, and SHP-1 (1Tuscano J.M. Engel P. Tedder T.F. Agarwal A.

The importance of CD22 in BCR signaling is demonstrated by the development of mice ablated in CD22 gene expression (5Nitschke L. Carsetti R. Ocker B. Kohler G. Lamers M.C. Curr.

These mice exhibit a spontaneous decrease in IgM expression and elevated calcium mobilization in response to BCR cross-linking. This suggests that CD22 is important in the negative regulation of BCR signaling. Interestingly, an elevated calcium response is also observed in mice deficient in either the Src family kinase, Lyn, or the tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-1 (9Cyster J.G. Goodnow C.C. Immunity. 1995; 2: 13-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 10Cornall R.J. Cyster J.G. Hibbs M.L. Dunn A.R. Otipoby K.L. Clark E.A. Goodnow C.C. Immunity. 1998; 8: 497-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), suggesting that these enzymes also contribute to the negative regulation of the BCR. Indeed, by examining mice that are heterozygous for a genetic defect for two or more of these genes, it has been demonstrated that CD22, Lyn, and SHP-1 interact to control BCR negative regulation (10Cornall R.J.

BCR activation results in Lyn phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of CD22, thus allowing for the recruitment of SHP-1 (10Cornall R.J. Cyster J.G. Hibbs M.L. Dunn A.R. Otipoby K.L. Clark E.A.

Furthermore, SHP-1 functions to regulate Syk kinase activity. 2L. Dustin, D. Plas, T. Hu, and M. L. Thomas, submitted for publication. 2L. Dustin, D. Plas, T. Hu, and M. L. Thomas, submitted for publication. Therefore, the interaction of CD22 and SHP-1 is central to BCR regulation. SHP-1 is a cytosolic enzyme containing two SH2 domains at the amino terminus. In its native form, SHP-1 has low basal catalytic activity. However, truncation of the SH2 domains or binding to the SH2 domains substantially increases its catalytic activity, suggesting that the SH2 domains regulate the catalytic activity by an allosteric mechanism (3Doody G.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13414-13418Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Further supportive evidence for this model comes from the recently solved crystal structure for a highly related phosphatase, SHP-2 (17Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). The resolution of the crystal structure shows that the first SH2 domain of SHP-2 interacts with the active site of the phosphatase domain to preclude substrate binding. Binding to the first SH2 domain may result in a conformational change allowing access to the catalytic site. Thus, it is likely that the SH2 domains of SHP-1 have two functions, to recruit the enzyme to appropriate locations and to regulate enzymatic activity. The tyrosine-phosphorylated sequence recognized by the SH2 domains of SHP-1 has been termed an immunoreceptortyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) with the consensus sequence (V/L/I)X(p)YXXL. The cytoplasmic domain of CD22 has five potential ITIMs (Table I). Tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides representing three of these sequences have been shown to increase SHP-1 activity and inhibit binding to CD22 (3Doody G. Justement L.B. Delibrias C.C. Matthews R.J. Lin J. Thomas M.L. Fearon D.T. Science. 1995; 269: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). To determine which of these potential ITIMs are necessary for SHP-1 binding, we co-expressed SHP-1 with a chimeric protein containing mutations of the ITIM sequences. Here we demonstrate that the ITIMs have redundant functions, and furthermore, two intact ITIMs are required for optimal binding to SHP-1. In addition, both SH2 domains of SHP-1 are required for the interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of CD22.Table ICD22 potential ITIM sequencesTyrosine residueITIM sequenceaThe CD22 consensus ITIM sequence is (V/I/L)X(p)YXX(L/I/V).765TVSYAILRF799TVTYSVIQK810MGDYENVNP825SIHYSELVQ845DVDYVTLKHa The CD22 consensus ITIM sequence is (V/I/L)X(p)YXX(L/I/V). Open table in a new tab HeLa cells were obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum andl-glutamine.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Cappel Organon Teknika Corp. (West Chester, PA). Mouse SHP-1(C453S) cDNA has been described previously (19Plas D.R. Johnson R. Pingel J.T. Matthews R.J. Dalton M. Roy G. Chan A.C. Thomas M.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into the SH2 domains of SHP-1 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) site overlap extension as described. 3Wang, L., Blasioli, J., Plas, D., Thomas, M., L., and Yokoyama, W., (1999) J. Immunol., in press. To construct SHP-1(ΔP), PCR site overlap extension was used to generate a BglII-BalI fragment with a deletion of the phosphatase catalytic domain signature motif (451VHCSAG456); the PCR primers used were 5′-CACAGCAGAATACAAACTGC-3′ (forward, outer), 5′-TCATGCAGGGCCCATCATTACGGGTACC-3′ (forward, inner), 5′-TATCCAATGACGATGATGGTACCCGTAATGATGGG-3′ (reverse, inner), and 5′-GGTCGTTTCGATGAACTGG-3′ (reverse, outer). ThisBglII-BalI PCR fragment was cloned into a modified Myc-tagged SHP-1 construct.2 CD22 constructs were made as a fusion protein comprising the extracellular and transmembrane domains of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG) and the cytoplasmic domain of mouse CD22 (amino acids 717–850). Substitutions of the tyrosines into phenylalanines were introduced by PCR site overlap extension (20Cahir McFarland E.D. Pingel J. Thomas M.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7169-7175Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. SHP-1 cDNAs were cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) behind the T7 promoter; CD22 cDNAs were cloned into pGEM-3Z (Promega) behind the T7 promoter. Following transfection/infection and overnight expression, HeLa cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm phenylarsine oxide, and 5 mm iodoacetamide) on ice for 10 min. The lysates were precleared with a 10% solution of Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem) and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. An aliquot was removed as the crude lysate sample; the remaining lysate was immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibodies. Immunoprecipitates and crude lysates were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. The gel was transferred onto nitrocellulose and blocked in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies (anti-VSVG, 1:2500; anti-SHP-1, 1:1000; 4G10, 1:3000) were diluted in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with the membranes for 1 h at room temperature. Following the primary antibody, membranes were washed twice in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and once with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 5 min, developed with appropriate secondary antibodies in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 30 min, and washed as described above. Proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). To define the site(s) of interaction between CD22 and SHP-1, a chimeric protein of the intact cytoplasmic domain of CD22, and the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the VSVG protein (G/22) and SHP-1 were expressed in HeLa cells. The G/22 chimeric protein is expressed on the membrane surface as determined by flow cytometric analysis (data not shown). Co-expression of G/22 with catalytically inactive SHP-1 (SHP-1(C453S)) results in tyrosine phosphorylation of G/22 and association with SHP-1 (Fig. 1). In contrast, under these conditions co-expression of G/22 with wild type SHP-1 results in no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of G/22 and no association of the two proteins. These data suggest that G/22 is a substrate of SHP-1. In addition, expression of G/22 alone in HeLa cells results in less tyrosine phosphorylation of G/22 compared with that seen when co-expressed with SHP-1(C453S). This indicates that binding of SHP-1 protects G/22 from dephosphorylation by endogenous phosphatases. Of note is the presence of a doublet detected by VSVG immunoblotting; the slower migrating band corresponds to tyrosine-phosphorylated G/22. To define the sites of interaction between SHP-1 and G/22, SHP-1(C453S) was used in our subsequent studies. The cytoplasmic domain of CD22 contains six tyrosine residues; tyrosine 795 does not fit the consensus ITIM sequence for SHP-1 and therefore was left unchanged. The remaining five tyrosines were all mutated to phenylalanine (TableI). To examine whether any single ITIM tyrosine was sufficient for SHP-1 binding, mutations were created such that only a single ITIM was left intact. Co-expression of single ITIM G/22 with SHP-1(C453S) revealed that only tyrosines 765 and 825 were consistently phosphorylated (data not shown). Neither pervanadate treatment nor co-expression with Lyn enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of the other single ITIM G/22 proteins. Co-expression of the single ITIM G/22 with SHP-1(C453S) resulted in poor and inconsistent association of the two proteins as measured by co-immunoprecipitation (data not shown). These findings suggest that more than one tyrosine is required for efficient tyrosine phosphorylation and binding to SHP-1. Previously, it was demonstrated that phosphotyrosine peptides representing the ITIM sequences of tyrosines 765, 825, or 845 but not 799 or 810 were capable of increasing SHP-1 activity and inhibiting binding of SHP-1 to CD22 (3Doody G. Justement L.B. Delibrias C.C. Matthews R.J. Lin J. Thomas M.L. Fearon D.T. Science. 1995; 269: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). When all ITIM tyrosines were mutated to phenylalanines, the G/22 protein was not tyrosine-phosphorylated or associated with SHP-1 (Fig.2 A). This indicates that phosphorylated tyrosines are required for the interaction between CD22 and SHP-1. To determine which phosphorylated tyrosines in CD22 were required for efficient binding to SHP-1, chimeric proteins were expressed containing two or three intact ITIMs (Fig. 2). When co-expressed in HeLa cells with SHP-1(C453S), the double ITIM G/22 chimeric protein containing tyrosines 765 and 825 was sufficient to mediate SHP-1 binding and tyrosine phosphorylation at a level comparable with that of wild type G/22, whereas that containing tyrosines 825 and 845 was slightly reduced compared with wild type G/22 (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, the double ITIM G/22 protein that comprised tyrosines 799 and 810 was neither tyrosine-phosphorylated nor associated with SHP-1 (Fig. 2 A). The double ITIM G/22 protein containing tyrosines 765 and 845 was less tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with less SHP-1(C453S) than wild type G/22. Based on these findings, one can speculate that tyrosine 825 is the primary SHP-1 binding site whereas tyrosines 765 and 845 are secondary SHP-1 binding sites, of which one is potentially the target for the phosphatase domain of SHP-1. The triple ITIM G/22 protein containing tyrosines 765, 825, and 845 confirmed the results from the double ITIM G/22 proteins. Compared with wild type G/22, this triple ITIM G/22 protein was tyrosine-phosphorylated and bound SHP-1 at an equivalent amount (Fig.2 B). However, the triple ITIM G/22 protein containing tyrosines 765, 799, and 825 was equally tyrosine-phosphorylated as wild type G/22 but associated with less SHP-1. One possible explanation is that in the absence of tyrosine 845, tyrosine 799 destabilizes the complex and thus does not allow for efficient binding of SHP-1. To determine whether both SH2 domains of SHP-1 were required for binding to CD22, mutations that eliminate phosphotyrosine binding (21Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) were introduced either into the individual SH2 domains or into both SH2 domains. The mutations were constructed using the cDNA encoding catalytically inactive SHP-1(C453S). When co-expressed with wild type G/22 protein or the double ITIM G/22 containing tyrosines 765 and 825, mutations that disrupted phosphotyrosine binding to both SH2 domains completely prevented the association of SHP-1 with G/22 (Fig.3). Results were the same for all combinations of double and triple ITIM G/22 proteins containing tyrosines 765, 825, and 845. SHP-1 with a single functional SH2 domain was capable of binding the CD22 cytoplasmic domain; however, the binding was dramatically decreased. Thus, both SH2 domains of SHP-1 are required for efficient binding to the cytoplasmic domain of CD22. The absence of tyrosine phosphorylation and association with SHP-1 to the G/22 protein in which all five tyrosines were mutated to phenylalanines confirmed that phosphorylated tyrosines interact with the SH2 domains of SHP-1. It is widely recognized that SHP-1(C453S) is a substrate-trapping mutant, whereas SHP-1(ΔP), which lacks the phosphatase catalytic signature motif, is a nontrapping mutant (22Timms J.F. Carlberg K. Gu H. Chen H. Kamatkar S. Nadler M.J.S. Rohrschneider L.R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3838-3850Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Using these two mutants, one can discriminate between SHP-1 substrates and binding proteins. Substrates bind to the SHP-1(C453S) phosphatase domain, and the phosphorylated tyrosine is protected from dephosphorylation by other endogenous phosphatases. However, this does not occur with SHP-1(ΔP); thus the substrate should exhibit greater tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of SHP-1(C453S) compared with SHP-1(ΔP) or wild type SHP-1. To this end, the wild type G/22 protein was co-expressed with wild type SHP-1, SHP-1(C453S), and SHP-1(ΔP). The level of tyrosine phosphorylation of G/22 when co-expressed with SHP-1(ΔP) was greatly reduced compared with that co-expressed with SHP-1(C453S) (Fig.4). In addition, less SHP-1 co-immunoprecipitated with G/22 in the presence of SHP-1(ΔP) compared with SHP-1(C453S). These results indicate that SHP-1 binds to G/22 via its phosphatase domain as well as the SH2 domains, thus confirming the earlier results that CD22 is a substrate of SHP-1. Nonetheless, the lack of SHP-1(C453S) binding to CD22 when both SH2 domains are mutated demonstrates that the SH2 domains are required for substrate trapping to occur (Fig. 3). CD22 is required for the negative regulation of the BCR. This effect is mediated by the recruitment and activation of SHP-1 to the cytoplasmic domain of CD22. Here, we demonstrate that at least two functional ITIMs and both SH2 domains of SHP-1 are required for efficient binding to the cytoplasmic domain of CD22. The requirement for both SHP-1 SH2 domains likely reflects the increased affinity achieved by binding tandem SH2 domains (23Ottinger E.A. Botfield M.C. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 729-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that the tandem SH2 domains of SHP-1 allow for SHP-1 to preferentially bind to the cytoplasmic domain of CD22 because of the increased binding affinity achieved by tandem SH2 domains compared with proteins with single SH2 domains. This phenomenon may explain why the two triple ITIM G/22 proteins exhibited a similar level of tyrosine phosphorylation but bound different amounts of SHP-1. Interestingly, CD22 is a potential substrate for SHP-1, and thus, it appears that there is an inherent feedback mechanism allowing for the disengagement of SHP-1 from CD22. This is supported by our finding that under the conditions we used, SHP-1(C453S) co-immunoprecipitates with G/22, which is tyrosine-phosphorylated. However, wild type SHP-1 does not co-immunoprecipitate, and G/22 is not tyrosine-phosphorylated. Thus, dephosphorylation of G/22 causes disassociation of the two proteins. Therefore, the requirement for both SHP-1 SH2 domains and at least two phosphorylated ITIM tyrosines may also reflect the necessity of maintaining SHP-1 binding to CD22 for a period of time sufficient to allow dephosphorylation of substrates involved in BCR signal transduction. In addition, the requirement for two ITIM sequences adds to the biological specificity, localizing SHP-1 activity to appropriate sites to control BCR signal transduction. The cytoplasmic domain of CD22 contains six tyrosines, of which five are potential ITIM sequences. Lyn has recently been shown to be required for the phosphorylation of CD22 cytoplasmic domain (10Cornall R.J. Cyster J.G. Hibbs M.L. Dunn A.R. Otipoby K.L. Clark E.A. Goodnow C.C.

CD22 also binds Syk, phospholipase Cγ, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (1Tuscano J.M. Engel P. Tedder T.F. Agarwal A. Kehrl J.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1246-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4Law C.-L. Sidorenko S.P. Chandran K.A. Zhao Z. Shen S.H. Fischer E.H. Clark E.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It is not known, however, which tyrosines are phosphorylated by Lyn and to which tyrosines these other molecules may bind. However, we have been unable to demonstrate binding of Syk or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to G/22 under similar conditions. 4X. He, D. Plas, and M. L. Thomas, unpublished data. In this study, we focused on mapping the interaction between CD22 and SHP-1. We have shown that three tyrosines, 765, 825, and 845, are capable of associating with SHP-1. Moreover, our results implicate tyrosine 825 as the primary SHP-1 binding site because the amount of SHP-1 associated with wild type G/22 was equal to that containing only tyrosines 765 and 825 or tyrosines 825 and 845. In addition, our results implicate tyrosine 765 as the target dephosphorylation site of SHP-1 because G/22 was maximally tyrosine-phosphorylated in the presence of tyrosines 765 and 825. That CD22 is a substrate of SHP-1 was confirmed by co-expression of SHP-1(ΔP) with wild type G/22. SHP-1(C453S) acts as a substrate-trapping mutant but needs the SH2 domains to bring CD22 to within close proximity prior to dephosphorylating (or binding via its catalytically inactive phosphatase domain). In contrast, SHP-1(ΔP) does not act as a substrate-trapping mutant as it does not have a functional phosphatase domain, and thus it only interacts with CD22 via its SH2 domains. SHP-1 substrates should exhibit greater tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of SHP-1(C453S) compared with SHP-1(ΔP). Indeed, this was observed when wild type G/22 was co-expressed with SHP-1(C453S) and SHP-1(ΔP) (Fig. 4). Interestingly, not all the single ITIM G/22 mutants were consistently tyrosine-phosphorylated; this could be because of a specific order required for phosphorylation. Recently this phenomenon has been described for the T cell receptor ζ chain (24Kersh E.N. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Science. 1998; 281: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Our results show that tyrosines 765 and 825 are tyrosine-phosphorylated as single ITIMs, whereas tyrosine 845 is not and requires a second tyrosine as demonstrated by the double ITIM G/22 protein containing tyrosines 825 and 845. It may be likely that tyrosines 765 and 825 also act to recruit a tyrosine kinase that then phosphorylates tyrosine 845 enabling complete binding and activation of SHP-1. Our results also show that there is specificity to which tyrosine SHP-1 binds, because the double ITIM G/22 protein containing tyrosines 799 and 810 did not bind to SHP-1. It remains to be determined whether the spacing between the tyrosines is critical for SHP-1 binding, as is the case for the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif and tyrosine kinases (25Bu J.-Y. Shaw A.S. Chan A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5106-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have shown that SHP-1 binds to several potentially biphosphorylated proteins, such as signaling inhibitory receptor proteins, paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B, and killer inhibitory receptors (22Timms J.F.

Thus, the requirement for two ITIM sequences may be a general mechanism directing biological specificity and duration of SHP-1 activity. The recently solved crystal structure for SHP-2 has provided important insights as to how the tandem SH2 domains may work in unison to regulate the catalytic activity of the enzyme (17Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). The amino SH2 domain interacts with the phosphatase domain preventing access to the catalytic site and preventing optimal phosphotyrosine binding. The carboxyl SH2 domain, in contrast, is freely available. Thus, as previously proposed (21Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), it is possible that the carboxyl SH2 domain acts to recruit SHP-1 to appropriate locations placing the amino SH2 domain in close proximity to a second ITIM sequence, which under these conditions engages, allowing for the conformation change needed for high affinity binding and enzymatic activity. Our data support this model for the recruitment and activation of SHP-1, by showing that for efficient binding, both SHP-1 SH2 domains are required. However, we were not able to determine whether there is any difference in the specificity of each SH2 domain, that is whether there are ITIM preferences for each SH2 domain. This may be important in spatially orienting SHP-1 correctly to dephosphorylate appropriate substrates. We thank David Plas, Tanya Ulyanova, and Andy Chan for comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2031079263,"We report construction and characterization of tetracycline-controlled hepatitis B virus pX-expressing hepatocyte (AML12) cell lines. These cell lines were constructed in AML12 clonal isolates (clones 3 and 4), which express constitutively the tetracycline-controlled transactivator. Since pX is implicated in HCC, this immortalized hepatocyte model system was used to investigate the mechanism of pX in transformation. Clonal isolates of 3pX and 4pX lineages display conditional synthesis of pX mRNA and protein and a 2-fold increase in growth saturation density following tetracycline removal, implicating pX in monolayer overgrowth. Interestingly, only 3pX clones display pX-dependent anchorage independence. Clone 3 lineages express hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α and hepatocyte-specific marker genes; clone 4 lineages express hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β and reduced levels of hepatocyte-specific marker genes, suggesting the importance of the differentiated hepatocyte in pX-mediated oncogenic transformation.Importantly, 3pX and 4pX lineages display differential expression of immediate early genes c-fos and ATF3. The pX-transforming 3pX lineage displays early, pX-dependent induction of ATF3 and prolonged induction of c-fos. The nontransforming 4pX cells display an absence of pX-dependent ATF3 induction and transient induction of c-fos. Our results support the direct link of pX expression to oncogenic transformation in 3pX lineage clones and underscore the advantage of this conditional cellular model system for studying mechanisms of pX-mediated oncogenesis.

While the published data clearly implicate pX in HCC, the direct oncogenic effect of pX in hepatocyte transformation has not been demonstrated. Herein, we provide evidence demonstrating the causal link of pX expression to the transformation of immortalized hepatocytes and describe a conditional pX expression system that is amenable to the study of the mechanism of pX-mediated transformation. pX is a multifunctional protein, with reported activities affecting transcription (14Casselmann W.H.

Although pX does not directly bind double-stranded DNA, pX acts as a promiscuous transactivator (reviewed in Ref. 14Casselmann W.H. Adv.

Virol. 1996; 70: 4978-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) pathways. By contrast, pX activation of CRE-mediated transcription involves direct protein-protein interactions of pX with the bZip factors CREB/ATF2 (35Maguire H.F. Hoeffler J.P. Siddiqui A. Science. 1991; 252: 842-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar,36Williams J.S. Andrisani O.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3819-3823Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Importantly, in addition to CREB, pX also interacts directly with other inducible bZip transcription factors, activators or repressors (37Barnabas S. Hai T. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20684-20690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which play important roles in hepatocyte physiology (40Buck M. Turler H. Chojkier M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 41Chen B.P.C. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 42Servillo G. Penna L. Foulkes N.S. Magni M.V. Fazia M.A.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This dual mechanism of pX action, namely the activation of mitogenic signaling cascades in the cytoplasm and the increased transcriptional efficacy of bZip transcription factors in the nucleus, clearly implicate pX in deregulation of hepatocyte gene expression, resulting in oncogenic transformation. However, the role of these activities of pX in cellular transformation cannot be assessed by the available model systems (15Koike K. Moriya K. Yotsuyanagi H. Iino S. Kurokawa K. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Kim H. Lee H. Yun Y. J. Biol.

To demonstrate a direct effect of pX in hepatocyte transformation and investigate basic in vivomechanisms of pX-mediated oncogenicity, we established a conditional pX-expressing cellular model system, composed of the immortalized mouse hepatocyte AML12 cell line (43Wu J.C. Merlino G. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and the tetracycline-controlled system of Gossen and Bujard (44Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4255) Google Scholar). We present data linking conditional pX expression in AML12 cells to several criteria characteristic of oncogenic transformation. Importantly, we demonstrate that this pX-mediated oncogenic transformation occurs only in differentiated hepatocytes, suggesting the importance of the hepatocyte environment in pX-mediated transformation. These conditional pX-expressing cell lines provide an ideal cellular model system to investigate signaling mechanisms of pX and its potential links to hepatocyte transformation, especially valuable when considering the multifunctional nature of HBV pX and the clinical significance of HCC. Plasmids PUHD15–1, PUHC13–3, and PUHD10–3, required for the tetracycline-repressible system, were kindly provided by Gossen and Bujard (44Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4255) Google Scholar). The HBV pX gene was cloned into PUHD10–3 plasmid, resulting in plasmid PUHD10–3-X. AML12 cells were kindly provided by Dr. N. Fausto. Cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum; a mixture of insulin, transferrin, and selenium (ITS, Life Technologies); 1.0 μm dexamethasone; and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (43Wu J.C. Merlino G. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed by calcium phosphate co-precipitation, using the Life Technologies, Inc. transfection kit. Briefly, 10–20% subconfluent cultures were transfected with 5 μg of PUHD15–1 plasmid encoding the tTA activator gene, in the presence of 2 μg of pKoNeo plasmid, encoding the neomycin phosphotransferase-selectable marker. Stable transformants were selected with 600 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin; Life Technologies, Inc.); G418-resistant foci were subcloned and propagated. tTA expression was verified by transient transfection of PUCH13–3 reporter (luciferase) plasmid, in the presence of increasing amounts of tetracycline (0–5 μg/ml). The selected G418 r,tTA +clonal isolates were used as recipients of 5 μg of PUHD10–3-pX plasmid DNA, co-transfected with an expression vector encoding the hygromycin resistance gene. Stable transformants were selected with 200 units/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem), in the presence of 5 μg/ml tetracycline. Hygromycin-resistant clonal isolates were tested for conditional pX expression by transiently transfecting the CRE3-CAT reporter plasmid, in the presence of 10 μm forskolin, with or without the addition of 2 μg/ml tetracycline. After 48 h, cell extracts were prepared, and CAT enzyme activity was determined as described (45Andrisani O.M. Pot D.A. Zhu Z. Dixon J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 8: 1947-1956Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Clonal isolates, displaying enhanced CRE3-CAT reporter activity in absence of tetracycline, were selected as putative pX-expressing clones and propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, ITS, 200 μg/ml G418, 70 μg/ml hygromycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 5 μg/ml tetracycline. All experiments utilized the constructed cell lines at passages 4–8. 2–5 × 105cells were seeded per 60-mm dish and grown in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml tetracycline. The medium was replaced daily; cells were counted every other day. 2–5 × 105 parental (G418 r,tTA +) or pX-expressing cells (G418 r,tTA +hygromycinr) were seeded in soft agar as described (46Shin S. Freedman V.H. Risser R. Pollack R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4435-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml tetracycline. Cell lines of clones 3 and 4 were propagated and tested as described by Cox and Der (47Cox A.D. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cells were fed daily and at 10–14 days were stained overnight with 1 mg/ml iodonitrotetrazolium and photographed. Total cellular RNA was prepared by the TRIZOL method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A+) mRNA was selected by the PolyATract isolation kit (Promega). Typically, 6–8 μg of poly(A+) mRNA or 30 μg of total RNA was analyzed by Northern blotting in 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel. Hybridization was at 42 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 45% formaldehyde, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. 32P-Radiolabeled pX and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probes were obtained using the random primer labeling kit (Ambion). Quantitation of Northern blots was carried out employing the OPTIMAS 6.1 program. 30–60% confluent cells were in vivo labeled (4 h) with [35S]methionine (ICN), 0.2 mCi/ml media. pX synthesis proceeded 12 h for the 4pX-1 clone or 48 h for the 3pX-1 clone before the addition of [35S]methionine. Cells were harvested in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% aprotinin; immunoprecipitations were carried out as described (48Fiol C.J. Williams J.S. Chou C.-H. Wang Q.M. Roach P.J. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 269: 32187-32193Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The pX-specific antibody was kindly provided by Dr. B. Slagle (Baylor College of Medicine). Analysis of immunoprecipitation reactions was by 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al. (49Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9159) Google Scholar). Gel retardation assays employed the32P-radiolabeled PE-56 albumin HNF-1 binding site (50Cereghini S. Blumenfeld M. Yaniv M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 957-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were carried out as described (51Mendel K.B. Hansen L.P. Graves M.K. Conley P.B. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1042-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Supershift assays employed HNF-1α antibody, kindly provided by Dr. M. Yaniv (Pasteur Institute) and were performed as described (50Cereghini S. Blumenfeld M. Yaniv M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 957-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Tetracycline-regulated cell lines expressing pX were generated from the hepatocyte AML12 cell line, derived from the liver of transgenic mice overexpressing TGF-α (43Wu J.C. Merlino G. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These tetracycline-regulated cell lines were constructed by generating two successive cell lines; the first was engineered to express the tetracycline-controlled activator (tTA); the second cell line was constructed in this tTA + background, to express pX under tTA control (44Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4255) Google Scholar). Several AML12 clonal isolates expressing tTA were obtained displaying activation ratios ranging from 2- to 56-fold (TableI). The tTA-responsive PUHD10–3-X plasmid-encoding pX was stably introduced in thetTA + clone 3 and 4 cell lines, resulting in 3pX and 4pX lineages. These lineages are thus composed of clonal isolates (3pX-1, 3pX-2, 4pX-1, 4pX-2, etc.) derived from 3pX and 4pX transfections. The conditional pX clonal isolates were selected using a pX/CREB-dependent functional assay (36Williams J.S. Andrisani O.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3819-3823Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), based on the enhanced transcriptional efficacy of endogenous CREB by pX (36Williams J.S. Andrisani O.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3819-3823Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Accordingly, putative 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cell lines display increased CREB-dependent transcription following tetracycline removal, whereas tetracycline removal did not affect CREB-dependent transcription in parental clones 3 and 4 (data not shown).

Northern blot analyses (Fig.1 A) established the tetracycline-regulated expression of pX mRNA in these putative pX-expressing cell lines. Expression of pX mRNA was detected at 1 h after tetracycline removal, reaching maximal levels by 12–48 h. In comparison with the 3pX-1 cell line, the 4pX-1 cell line expressed approximately 3-fold more pX mRNA (Fig. 1 B) following tetracycline removal. Northern blot analyses of two additional, independently isolated putative pX-expressing clones from both lineages also demonstrated conditional pX mRNA expression (data not shown). To conclusively demonstrate the conditional synthesis of pX, we carried out immunoprecipitation reactions of cellular extracts isolated from 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cells, metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, following tetracycline removal. We observed pX expression in extracts of cells grown without tetracycline (Fig. 1 C). pX was not detected in extracts from either 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cells grown in the presence of tetracycline or in control clones 3 and 4, demonstrating the tetracycline-regulated synthesis of the X protein. Saturation density analyses of 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cell lines (Fig. 2) were used to assess the potential of cells expressing pX to overgrow the monolayer, a criterion indicating oncogenic transformation. The growth saturation density of 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cell lines in media containing tetracycline is similar to the respective parental cell lines. Removal of tetracycline, thus allowing pX synthesis, resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in saturation density of both 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cell lines, in comparison with the parental control clones 3 and 4, also grown without tetracycline. This observation demonstrates that pX promotes overgrowth of the monolayer in 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cells. Anchorage-independent growth is often correlated with tumorigenesis and is an important criterion for cultured cell transformation (46Shin S. Freedman V.H. Risser R. Pollack R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4435-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the potential of the 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cell lines for anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, following pX induction (Fig. 3). 3pX-1 cells grown in the absence of tetracycline, formed large foci in soft agar, whereas the addition of tetracycline suppressed focus formation (Fig. 3 A). The transformation efficiency of clone 3 is similar to that observed with 3pX-1 cells grown in the presence of tetracycline; by comparison, removal of tetracycline promoted a 10-fold increase in transformation efficiency of 3pX-1 cells (Fig.3 B). This observation demonstrates the importance of pX induction and activity in the anchorage-independent growth displayed by the 3pX-1 cell line. Importantly, additional independent clonal isolates of the 3pX lineage also demonstrated anchorage-independent growth, similar to the 3pX-1 cell line (data not shown). Surprisingly, the 4pX-1 cell line failed to demonstrate anchorage independence under conditions of pX induction (Fig. 3). Analysis of two additional, independently isolated clonal cell lines from the 4pX lineage (data not shown) demonstrated that they also lacked the ability to form foci in soft agar. We noted a marked difference in cell morphology between cells of the 3pX and 4pX lineages (Fig. 4 A). 3pX-1 cells, even at 48 h after passage, contained clusters of rounded, epithelioid cells that adhered loosely to the surface; this phenotype was even more pronounced when cells were grown in the absence of tetracycline. By comparison, 4pX-1 cells appeared mesenchymal and did not display the rounded form characteristic of nonadhering cells, suggesting that anchorage independence is linked to pX expression in a lineage-specific manner. More than 90% of the nonadherent 3pX-1 cells, observed after passage in tetracycline-free medium (Fig. 4 A), were viable, as confirmed by trypan blue staining. Since anchorage independence is an important criterion of cultured cell transformation (46Shin S. Freedman V.H. Risser R. Pollack R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4435-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), we reasoned that nonadherent 3pX-1 cells may represent transformed hepatocytes. To test this hypothesis, nonadherent cells from cultures grown in the absence of tetracycline for 48 h were tested for anchorage-independent growth. These nonadherent 3pX-1 cells produced robust foci in soft agar. Approximately 30% of the foci that stained with iodonitrotetrazolium were larger than 80 μm in diameter; tetracycline addition reduced focus formation by 50%, whereas continuous growth of nonadherent 3pX-1 cells in the presence of tetracycline resulted in approximately 70% reduction in focus formation (Fig. 4 B). Parental clone 3 cells displayed only minimal growth in soft agar (Fig. 4 B); 4pX cell lines did not grow as nonadherent cultures (data not shown). To address this seeming discrepancy of the transforming potential of pX in the 3pX and 4pX lineages, we investigated their stage of differentiation. Clones 3 and 4 and cell lines 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 were examined for the expression of HNF-1α, a transcription factor characterizing differentiated hepatocytes (50Cereghini S. Blumenfeld M. Yaniv M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 957-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar,51Mendel K.B. Hansen L.P. Graves M.K. Conley P.B. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1042-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were analyzed by gel retardation assays, employing the PE-56 binding site of HNF-1, recognized by both HNF-1α and HNF-1β (50Cereghini S. Blumenfeld M. Yaniv M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 957-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Supershift assays employing the HNF-1α antibody demonstrated the presence of high levels of transcription factor HNF-1α in extracts obtained from parental clone 3 and 3pX-1 cells (Fig. 5 A), a characteristic of differentiated hepatocytes (50Cereghini S. Blumenfeld M. Yaniv M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 957-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). By contrast, in extracts from clone 4 and 4pX-1 cells, the addition of HNF-1α antibody resulted in only a minor supershift of the DNA-protein complex (Fig. 5 A). This suggests that the HNF-1 DNA-protein complex forms instead with transcription factor HNF-1β, which also binds the HNF-1 site and is expressed in dedifferentiated hepatocytes (50Cereghini S. Blumenfeld M. Yaniv M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 957-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 51Mendel K.B. Hansen L.P. Graves M.K. Conley P.B. Crabtree G.R.

Inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity by ouabain leads to β-cell membrane depolarization and Ca2+ influx. Because glucose-induced β-cell membrane depolarization cannot be attributed solely to closure of ATP-regulated K+ channels, we investigated whether glucose regulates other transport proteins, such as the Na+,K+-ATPase. Glucose inhibited Na+,K+-ATPase activity in single pancreatic islets and intact β-cells. This effect was reversible and required glucose metabolism.

Glucose metabolism increases the ATP:ADP ratio and initiates the β-cell stimulus-secretion coupling by closing ATP-regulated potassium (K+ATP)1channels (1Ashcroft F.M. Harrison D.E. Ashcroft S.J.H. Nature. 1984; 312: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). These channels are the main regulators of the β-cell resting membrane potential, and their closure will initiate membrane depolarization, opening of voltage-gated l-type Ca2+ channels, and thereby an increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) (2Prentki M. Matschinsky F.M. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 1185-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Zawalich W.S. Rasmussen H. Mol. Cell.

Ashcroft S.J.H. Harrison D.E. J. Physiol. 1988; 400: 501-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, depolarization of the plasma membrane from resting potential to threshold potential of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels requires, in addition to closure of K+ATP channels, an inward current (6Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). The origin of this inward current is not known, but it has been suggested that the current is carried by Na+ or Ca2+ (6Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar,7Henquin J.C. Meissner H.P. Experientia. 1984; 40: 1043-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Thus, glucose may activate an as yet unidentified component affecting β-cell membrane potential.Further support for the proposition that glucose has effects on membrane potential distinct from closing K+ATPchannels was provided by studies of action potential frequency in the presence of tolbutamide and glucose (8Bozem M. Henquin J.-C. Pflügers Arch. 1988; 413: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These studies show that stimulatory concentrations of glucose have the ability to induce an increased frequency of action potentials that is significantly higher than what is observed in the presence of maximal concentrations of the K+ATP channel blocker tolbutamide, thus suggesting the existence of an additional regulator of β-cell membrane potential that might be affected by glucose metabolism.The Na+,K+-ATPase is involved in maintaining the Na+ and K+ gradients across the β-cell plasma membrane. It extrudes three Na+ ions in exchange for two K+ ions, generating a net outward flow of cations through the cell membrane. This makes the pump electrogenic and results in a hyperpolarizing effect on membrane potential. Consequently, inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity (for example, by ouabain) leads to β-cell membrane depolarization (7Henquin J.C. Meissner H.P. Experientia. 1984; 40: 1043-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 9Nilsson T. Arkhammar P. Rorsman P. Berggren P.-O. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1993; 300: 372-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It has therefore been postulated that a decrease in Na+,K+-ATPase-mediated ion gradients may be a contributing mechanism to insulin secretion (7Henquin J.C. Meissner H.P. Experientia. 1984; 40: 1043-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 8Bozem M. Henquin J.-C. Pflügers Arch. 1988; 413: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 9Nilsson T. Arkhammar P. Rorsman P. Berggren P.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1855-1860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precise role of the Na+,K+-ATPase in membrane depolarization and its possible regulation by glucose in β-cells have been difficult to define, primarily because data reporting changes in enzyme activity have been obtained in cell homogenates or membrane preparations, lacking intact intracellular signaling pathways. Although it was reported that glucose had an inhibitory effect on Na+,K+-ATPase activity (11Levin S.R. Kasson B.G. Driessen J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 62: 692-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), others failed to demonstrate significant changes in enzyme activity (12Gronda C.M. Rossi J.P. Gagliardino J.J. Methods Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 1989; 11: 341-344PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, none of the studies mentioned above have examined short-term effects of glucose, i.e. within the time frame matching the initial cellular events in the insulin secretory process.RESULTSIn this study, we examined the extent to which changes in Na+,K+-ATPase activity contribute to β-cell membrane depolarization and thereby to opening of l-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and influx of Ca2+. Cells were exposed to 1 mm ouabain, a concentration that induced maximal inhibition of the pancreatic β-cell Na+,K+-ATPase activity. The effect of ouabain on β-cell membrane potential was determined using the perforated-patch configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Cells were perifused with a nonstimulatory concentration (4 mm) of glucose. Addition of ouabain to the medium resulted in prompt (within 60–100 s) depolarization of membrane potential (Fig.1 A), which increased from a resting potential of approximately −55 mV to a plateau potential of about −40 mV, upon which action potentials were superimposed.The effect of ouabain on [Ca2+]i was determined in small clusters of 5–10 cells (Fig. 1 B). Addition of 1 mm ouabain to cells incubated in the presence of 4 mm glucose induced a rapid and reversible increase (130 ± 17% above basal, n = 18,p < 0.001) in [Ca2+]i. A subsequent challenge with 15 mm glucose did not significantly increase [Ca2+]i further (153 ± 15% above basal, n = 18, p = 0.323versus ouabain) when compared with the increase obtained with ouabain alone. The increase in [Ca2+]ielicited by ouabain was completely abolished in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and rapidly restored upon addition of 1.3 mm Ca2+ to the perifusion medium. Moreover, the presence of 50 μmd-600, a voltage-dependent l-type Ca2+channel blocker, abolished the increase in [Ca2+]i.The Na+,K+-ATPase activity is inhibited by Ca2+ (25Yngst D.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although this effect has not been reported to occur in intact cells but rather in a cell free system, the effect of glucose on Na+,K+-ATPase activity was examined after omitting Ca2+ from the extracellular medium. In the absence of Ca2+ and simultaneous presence of extracellular EGTA (0.5 mm), 10 mm glucose was still able to inhibit Na+,K+-ATPase activity (60 ± 8% of control, n = 6, p < 0.05).Because the K+ATP channel is essential in regulating pancreatic β-cell membrane potential (5Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Harrison D.E. J. Physiol. 1988; 400: 501-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 6Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar), one may question whether the depolarizing effect of ouabain is brought about via a direct and/or an indirect effect on this channel. To examine these possibilities, we studied K+ATP channel activity in excised patches as well as in intact cells. As seen in Fig.1 C, ouabain had no effect on channel activity in inside-out patches, suggesting that ouabain has no direct effect on the K+ATP channel complex. It has recently been reported that ouabain induces a reduction in the number of open K+ATP channels in intact β-cells and that this might be the mechanism whereby ouabain depolarizes the β-cell membrane and thereby increases [Ca2+]i (10Grapengiesser E. Berts A. Saha S. Lund P.-E. Gylfe E. Hellman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 372-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To correlate this finding with acute regulation of Na+,K+-ATPase activity, we studied channel activity using the cell-attached mode of the patch-clamp technique. To increase the number of active channels and thereby the resolution of channel events, we performed the experiments in the absence of glucose. As seen in Fig. 1 C, ouabain did not affect channel activity within 2 min of exposure, the time period during which the cell depolarizes and an increase in [Ca2+]i is observed. Mean K+ATP channel currents were not altered (3 ± 4%, n = 7, not significantversus control prior exposure to ouabain). Ouabain was, however, still able to induce action potentials in the β-cell when perifused with a threshold concentration of glucose (Fig.1 C).We next studied the effect of glucose on Na+,K+-ATPase activity in single isolated pancreatic islets. Incubation of single medium size islets (2.4 ± 0.4 μg of protein, n = 5) with glucose resulted in a time-dependent (ANOVA p < 0.01) and dose-dependent (ANOVA p < 0.005) inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity (Fig.2, A and B). Ouabain-insensitive ATPase activity was not affected by glucose (control, 39.2 ± 2.3, n = 8 versus 15 mm glucose, 38.2 ± 3.1, (nmol of Pi/islet/h) n = 8). The inhibitory effect of glucose was reversible (Fig. 2 C). After exposure to 15 mm glucose for 10 min at 37 °C, the medium (5 μl) was removed and replaced with a medium containing 3 mm glucose for additional 10 min. After this washout period, Na+,K+-ATPase activity returned to control levels.Figure 2Effect of glucose on Na+,K+-ATPase activity in single isolated pancreatic islets.

Likewise, glucose needs to be metabolized in order to inhibit Na+,K+-ATPase activity. The presence of an equimolar concentration (15 mm) of the glycolytic inhibitor mannoheptulose substantially prevented the inhibitory effect of glucose (Fig. 2 C). That glucose needs to be metabolized and the requirement of an intact intracellular signaling system were further supported by the lack of effect of glucose on Na+,K+-ATPase activity in a β-cell-free system (not shown), similar to what has been previously reported (12Gronda C.M. Rossi J.P. Gagliardino J.J. Methods Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 1989; 11: 341-344PubMed Google Scholar).Na+,K+-ATPase activity was also determined in β-cells in suspension. Na+,K+-ATPase activity (nmol of Pi/mg of protein/min) in this preparation was 39 ± 1, n = 20, whereas the ouabain-insensitive ATPase was 37 ± 3 (n = 20). After isolation, β-cells were suspended in 3.6 mm glucose for approximately 10 min at room temperature. A further increase in the glucose concentration induced a dose-dependent decrease in Na+,K+-ATPase catalytic activity, with a maximal effect at 7.5 mm of glucose (ANOVA,p < 0.01). Changes in enzyme activity were also time-dependent and occurred as early as 1 min after glucose administration and persisted for at least 5 min (ANOVA,p < 0.001). The ouabain-insensitive ATPase activity was not affected by glucose (control, 37.4 ± 4, n= 4 versus 15 mm glucose, 39.0 ± 2,n = 7, not significant). Also, the effect of glucose on Na+,K+-ATPase activity in β-cell suspension was reversible (not shown).The inhibitory action of glucose requires its metabolism and was absent when a broken cell preparation was used. The pancreatic β-cell is endowed with a phospholipase A2 that is regulated in a Ca2+-independent fashion by the increase in ATP resulting from glucose metabolism (26Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14526-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Gross R.W. Ramanadham S. Kruszka K.K. Han X. Turk T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This phospholipase is inhibited by HELSS. It was previously reported that pretreatment of pancreatic β-cells with HELSS prevented the increase in [Ca2+]i and insulin secretion induced by glucose but not KCl or carbachol (28Ramanadham S. Gross R.W. Han X. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Pancreatic β-cells from ob/ob mice treated with 25 μm HELSS for 30 min at room temperature did not change islet Na+,K+-ATPase activity significantly, whereas HELSS abolished the inhibitory effect of glucose (Fig. 3).Activation of β-cell phospholipase A2 by glucose results in hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids and the consequent increase in the production of arachidonic acid (27Gross R.W. Ramanadham S. Kruszka K.K. Han X. Turk T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Incubation of single islets with arachidonic acid (AA) resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity (Fig.4 A), with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of approximately 4 nm. We evaluated the effect of glucose and AA on Na+,K+-ATPase activity in the presence and absence of relative selective inhibitors of the three main pathways of AA metabolism. The cyclooxygenase pathway was inhibited with indomethacin (Indo), the cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase with ethoxyresorufin (ETX) (29Omata K. Abraham N.G. Escalante B. Laniado Schwartzman M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F8-F16PubMed Google Scholar), and the lipooxygenase pathway with nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) (30Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Bray M.A. Smith M.J.H. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1979; 31: 868-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In previous studies, incubation with each pathway inhibitor alone for as long as 30 min at room temperature did not alter Na+,K+-ATPase activity in renal proximal tubules (31Ominato M. Satoh T. Katz A.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 152: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Similarly, none of the inhibitors affected the enzyme activity in isolated pancreatic islets (not shown). However, the inhibitory effect of glucose (15 mm) or AA on Na+,K+-ATPase activity (10 nm) was completely blocked by 0.1 mm of the lipooxygenase inhibitor NDGA (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, neither ETX nor Indo modified the inhibition of islet Na+,K+-ATPase by either glucose or AA. Because the effect of glucose was abolished by NDGA, we next examined whether 12(S)-HETE, the main lipooxygenase metabolite found in pancreatic β-cells (32Shannon V.R. Ramanadham S. Turk J. Holtzman L. Am. J.

We have also compared the effect of 12(S)-HETE with that of other eicosanoids on Na+,K+-ATPase activity (TableI). Whereas 1 nm12(S)-HETE significantly inhibited Na+,K+-ATPase activity (as in Fig. 4) the same concentration of the 12(R)-HETE isomer did not. 20-HETE induced a ∼20% inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity as described previously in renal epithelial cells (31Ominato M.

In the present study, the effect of glucose on Na+,K+-ATPase activity was blocked by the specific PKC inhibitor Bis (Fig.5 A). Similarly, Bis blocked the inhibitory effect of 12(S)-HETE. Additional experiments were performed in the presence of exogenous activators of PKC. Phorbol ester (phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate) inhibited Na+,K+-ATPase activity (vehicle, 14.6 ± 1.2, n = 5 versus 10 nm phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, 7.1 ± 1.7, n = 5,p < 0.05), and this inhibition was not affected by HELSS (6.6 ± 1.9, n = 5, not significant). Accordingly, in β-cells labeled with 32P-orthophosphate, glucose increased the state of phosphorylation of Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit, and this effect was blocked by Bis (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Effect of PKC inhibition on the ability of glucose and 12(S)-HETE to regulate islet Na+,K+-ATPase activity.

A typical recording following an increase in the glucose concentration from 3 to 15 mm is shown in Fig. 6 A. An increase in glucose concentration leads to depolarization of membrane potential, followed by a train of action potentials, which ceases as the concentration of glucose is lowered to 3 mm. Preincubation of β-cells with 1 μm of the PKC inhibitor Bis for 30 min and its continuous presence throughout the experiment did not affect glucose-induced electrical activity (Fig.6 B). Inclusion of 12(S)-HETE was without effect on membrane potential or electrical activity at 3 or 15 mmglucose (Fig. 6, C and E, respectively). At 6 mm glucose, which is an intermediate glucose concentration at which the β-cell membrane potential slowly fluctuates, 12(S)-HETE was also unable to affect electrical activity (Fig. 6 D).Figure 6Recordings of β-cell membrane potential using the perforated patch configuration of the patch clamp technique.

Meissner H.P. J. Physiol. 1982; 332: 529-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), its regulation by glucose has remained controversial (11Levin S.R. Kasson B.G. Driessen J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 62: 692-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Gronda C.M. Rossi J.P. Gagliardino J.J. Methods Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 1989; 11: 341-344PubMed Google Scholar). One reason for this may be that previous investigations were performed on broken-cell preparations in which glucose metabolism was not preserved. In this study, we present evidence that glucose indeed causes a rapid, reversible, and dose-dependent inhibition of the Na+,K+-ATPase, and we suggest possible mechanisms involved in this effect. The experiments were performed in intact, single islets or in β-cells in suspension, under conditions that preserve signal-transduction pathways, including those necessary for glucose metabolism. The requirement for glucose metabolism is supported by the lack of effect of glucose on Na+,K+-ATPase activity in the presence of mannoheptulose, which inhibits glucokinase (Ref. 35Randle P.J. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar and references therein) and thereby blocks further glucose metabolism.Several intracellular signaling messengers have been associated with the insulin secretory process induced by glucose. Among the earliest events in the signaling cascade is the activation of phospholipase A2, which is Ca2+-independent and is regulated by glucose and ATP (27Gross R.W. Ramanadham S. Kruszka K.K. Han X. Turk T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Similarly, the inhibitory effect of glucose on Na+,K+-ATPase activity is Ca2+-independent and is blocked by HELSS, a selective blocker of certain PLA2 isoforms (36Hazen S.L. Ford D.A. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5629-5633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipase A2 has been localized both in the plasma membrane and in the cytosol, but only in the latter location is it regulated by ATP (27Gross R.W. Ramanadham S. Kruszka K.K. Han X. Turk T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting that its translocation to the plasma membrane could be a possible mechanism of activation and targeting to the specific substrate. Despite the specificity of HELSS for the Ca2+-independent PLA2, we cannot exclude the contribution of other HELSS-insensitive PLA2 isoforms, which release arachidonic acid within the β-cells.Among the PLA2, the preferred substrates are the plasmalogens, rather than diacyl substrates (27Gross R.W. Ramanadham S. Kruszka K.K. Han X. Turk T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of arachidonate from the sn-2 position of choline and ethanolamine phospholipids. In the present study, AA decreased Na+,K+-ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner, similar to results reported earlier in kidney tubules (31Ominato M. Satoh T. Katz A.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 152: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This observation could explain previous reports that AA induces β-cell membrane depolarization and thereby facilitates Ca2+ entry and insulin secretion (37Wolf B.A. Pasquale S.M. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6372-6379Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activit"

The TOL plasmid pWW0 of Pseudomonas putida specifies ameta-cleavage pathway for the oxidative catabolism of benzoate and toluates. Genes encoding the TOL meta-cleavage pathway are grouped into a single operon, the expression of which is positively regulated at the level of transcription by thexylS gene product, which is activated by benzoate effectors (1Franklin F.C.H.

Stimulation of transcription from the Pm promoter requires a DNA sequence extending to about 80 bp1 upstream of the transcription initiation point (5Gallegos M.T. Marqués S. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6427-6434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kessler B. de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 7Ramos J.L. Mermod N. Timmis K.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1987; 1: 297-300Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). On the basis of genetic data, two regions can be distinguished in the architecture of the Pm promoter: the XylS interaction region, which extends from about −40 to −80 bp (Fig. 1); and the downstream RNA polymerase recognition region, which exhibits atypical −35 and −10 DNA sequences (Fig. 1). Transcription from the Pm promoter in the early exponential growth phase is mediated by RNA polymerase with ς32, and later with ςS, although regardless of the growth phase, expression from Pm remains dependent on XylS, and the transcription initiation point is the same (8Marqués S. Gallegos M.T. Ramos J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Marqués S. Manzanera M. González-Pérez M.M. Gallegos M.T. Ramos J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Kessler et al. (6Kessler B. de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) proposed that the XylS binding region in Pm was organized as two homologous 15-bp tandemly imperfect directly repeated motifs (5′-TGCAAPuAAPyGGNTA-3′). The distal one with respect to the RNA polymerase region extends from −70 to −56, and the proximal one extends from −49 to −35 (Fig. 1). Gallegos et al. (5Gallegos M.T. Marqués S. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6427-6434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also studied the organization of the XylS binding sites in the Pm promoter and suggested that sequences shorter than those proposed by Kessler et al. (6Kessler B. de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) might suffice for XylS activation of transcription. These workers found that promoters that had been deleted up to −60 could be activated by constitutive XylS mutants (but not by the wild-type regulator) and that extension of the deletion to −51 prevented transcription. Gallegos et al.(5Gallegos M.T. Marqués S. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6427-6434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the XylS binding site is represented by the motif T(C/A)CAN4TGCA, which appears twice in the promoter sequence, between −46 and −57 and between −67 and −78 (Fig. 1). This study was designed to shed light on the nucleotides in the Pm promoter that are critical for XylS-dependent stimulation of transcription. Escherichia coli MC4100 was grown at 30 °C in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented, when required, with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 μg/ml kanamycin, or 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The plasmids used in this study, and previously constructed were: pERD103, which is an IncQ plasmid encoding kanamycin resistance (7Ramos J.L. Mermod N. Timmis K.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1987; 1: 297-300Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar); pJLR100, which is a pEMBL9 derivative bearing the Pm promoter cloned between the EcoRI and HindIII sites (3Ramos J.L. Stolz A. Reineke W. Timmis K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8467-8471Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); pMD1405, which carries a promoterless ′lacZ gene and encodes resistance to ampicillin; and pJLR107, which is a pMD1405 derivative bearing the Pm promoter in front of ′lacZ (3Ramos J.L. Stolz A. Reineke W. Timmis K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8467-8471Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). DNA preparation, digestion with restriction enzymes, analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis, isolation of DNA fragments, ligations, transformations, and sequencing reactions were done according to standard procedures (10$$Google Scholar). DNA was methylated in vitro with 2 mm dimethyl sulfate as described (10$$Google Scholar). For in vivo DNA metylation, E. coli cells bearing the Pm promoter in pMD1405 were exposed to 2 mm dimethyl sulfate for 1 min at 30 °C. Cells were processed as described (10$$Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was extracted by using the Qiagen Kit (Quiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The oligonucleotide 5′-CGTCTAAGAAACCATTATTATCAG-3′ was complementary to the noncoding strand upstream from the Pm promoter region. The first C at the 5′-end was located 218 bp from the +1 of the transcription initiation point. The oligonucleotide 5′-GGGTCGGTGAACATCTCGCGCTTGC-3′ was complementary to the coding strand downstream from the Pm promoter. The first G at the 5′-end was located 124 bp from the +1 of the start of the transcript. For primer extension with Taq-DNA-polymerase, about 2 × 105 cpm of the corresponding oligonucleotide end-labeled with 32P was used. The extension products were separated by electrophoresis on urea-polyacrylamide sequencing gels. The Pm mutant promoters were generated by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis as described (5Gallegos M.T. Marqués S. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6427-6434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The internal oligonucleotide primers used for mutagenesis exhibited one or more mismatches with respect to the wild-type sequence. The external oligonucleotide was the so-called M13 reverse primer (5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATG-3′) or a primer complementary to the α fragment of the lacZ gene (5′-GATGTGCTGCAAGGCGATTAAGTTA-3′). After DNA amplification, the resulting DNA was digested withEcoRI and HindIII, and the 401-bpEcoRI-HindIII Pm mutants were inserted between the EcoRI-HindIII sites of pMD1405 to yield plasmids pMARx (the x indicates the plasmid number from 5D to 296). All the mutant Pm promoters generated in this study were confirmed by DNA sequencing. E. coli bearing the wild-type Pm::′lacZ or mutant Pm*::′lacZ fusions in pMD1405, plus pERD103, were grown overnight on Luria-Bertani medium containing the appropriate antibiotics. Cultures were diluted 100-fold in triplicate in the same medium supplemented or not with 1 mm 3MB. After 4 h of incubation, β-galactosidase activity was determined in duplicate in permeabilized cells (5Gallegos M.T. Marqués S. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6427-6434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reactivity of guanine residues in the Pm promoter toward dimethyl sulfate was assayedin vivo. DNA protection analysis was done in E. coli bearing only pJLR107 (Pm) or pJLR107 and pERD103 (XylS) and in the absence and in the presence of 3MB. Methylation was done when cells had reached the mid-logarithmic growth phase. As a control, Pm was also methylated in vitro. Representative results are shown in Fig. 2. In the bottom strand, a significant feature of thein vitro and in vivo methylation pattern is hypermethylation of the T located at −42. This indicates that the DNA was distorted at this point, probably due to the tracks of As in the −41 to −46 region in the top strand (Fig.1). The methylation of T−42 in vivo in cells without XylS was more pronounced thanin vitro, indicating that this distortion may have been more pronounced in vivo. The methylation pattern of Pm in vivo in cells without XylS was very similar in the absence and in the presence of 3MB. However, the presence of the effector influenced the methylation pattern of Pm in cells bearing the XylS protein. When cells expressed the XylS protein, methylation of T−42 was highest in the presence of the effector, whereas in the absence of the effector, T−42 appeared to be more protected than in cells without XylS (Fig. 2). In contrast with this behavior was the observation that Gs in the −47 to −61 region appeared to be protected in the presence of the effector. However, G−68 appeared to be more methylated in the presence of effector (Fig. 2). This set of results suggested that the XylS protein is able to bind to Pm; however, the critical interactions could not be deduced from this assay. In the top strand in Fig. 2, the −3 to −40 region showed a definite pattern of methylation. The Gs in the −3 to −28 region were more methylated in vitro than in vivo. In particular, G−23 and G−38 were clearly protected in vivo regardless of the presence of XylS and the presence of an effector. A characteristic of the members of the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators is that they recognize short nucleotide motifs (4–6 bp) at their cognate promoters (11Gallegos M.T. Schleif R. Bairoch A. Hofmann K. Ramos J.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). For this reason, we decided to carry out initial block scanning mutagenesis assays of the Pm region between −41 and −78. This interval includes all nucleotides previously proposed as important in XylS for Pm recognition (5Gallegos M.T. Marqués S. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6427-6434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kessler B. de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 7Ramos J.L. Mermod N. Timmis K.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1987; 1: 297-300Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and the region in which in vivofootprinting analyses revealed alterations in the methylation pattern. The interval excluded mutations in the putative −35 region of the Pm (Fig. 1), which, as shown in the in vivo footprinting analysis, may interfere with recognition of the promoter by the RNA polymerase. A series of 4-bp blocks to induce mutations were introduced randomly by polymerase chain reaction. These included the four TNCA motifs found in this region (−46/−49, −54/−57, −67/−70, and −75/−78), the intervening sequences between two adjacent TNCA sequences (−50/−53, −58/−61, −62/−65, −63/−66, and −71/−74), a sequence between the TNCA sequence closer to the RNA polymerase binding site (−46/−49), and the −41 nucleotide (−41/−44). In all cases the mutant promoters (Pm*) were fused to ′lacZ in pMD1405. β-Galactosidase activity was determined in E. coli MC4100 (Pm*::′lacZ, pERD103) grown in the absence and in the presence of 3MB. The basal level of expression from the Pm* promoters (50–100 Miller units) was similar to the basal level of expression determined from the Pm wild-type promoter. However, with regard to the induced levels of expression of the mutant promoters, three classes of Pm mutants were found (TableI): 1) mutant promoters that exhibited less than 20% of the wild-type activity; 2) mutant Pm promoters with a level of XylS-dependent expression between 65 and 25% of the expression measured with the wild-type promoter; and 3) mutant Pm promoters that conserved wild-type or near wild-type XylS-dependent inducible β-galactosidase activity,i.e. ≥80% of wild-type levels.Table IBlock scanning mutagenesis of the upstream region of the Pm promoter and its effect on its transcriptional activityPromoterβ-Galactosidase activityActivity of wild-typeunits%Pm wild-type8900100Pm 250 (−44/−41 AAAA → CCCT)385043Pm 251 (−45/−42 AAAA → TCAA)560062Pm 252 (−45/−42 AAAA → CCAA)555062Pm 206 (−49/−46 TGCA → GTCA)170019Pm 207 (−49/−46 TGCA → GAGG)5506Pm 208 (−49/−46 TGCA → GTGT)3504Pm 209 (−49/−46 TGCA → ACAG)5006Pm 253 (−49/−46 TGCA → GGCG)120013Pm 254 (−49/−46 TGCA → GGCC)6007Pm 255 (−49/−46 TGCA → TCGA)5005Pm 230 (−53/−50 GGAG → CACC)813091Pm 257 (−53/−50 GGAG → AAAG)860097Pm 212 (−57/−54 TACA → GCAG)210024Pm 213 (−57/−54 TACA → GTTT)800089Pm 259 (−61/−58 CGGA → CCAA)350039Pm 260 (−61/−58 CGGA → CTCA)270030Pm 261 (−61/−58 CGGA → CGCA)450051Pm 264 (−66/−63 GAAA → GAGT)440050Pm 267 (−66/−63 GAAA → CTAA)650073Pm 268 (−66/−63 GAAA → GGAA)9900111Pm 222 (−70/−67 TGCA → ACGT)560063Pm 219 (−70/−67 TGCA → AACA)220025Pm 220 (−70/−67 TGCA → AGCA)290033Pm 233 (−74/−71 GCCT → TCCG)8900100Pm 226 (−78/−75 TCCA → GATT)740083Pm 245 (−49/−46, TGCA → AGGA; −57/−54 TACA → TTGG)601Pm 244 (−57/−54 TACA → GTTT; −67/−70, TGCA → ACGT)150016E. coli MC4100 bearing the indicated Pm*:′lacZfusion and xylS in pERD103 were grown on LB medium with 3MB as described under “Materials and Methods.” In the absence of 3MB, basal activity was 50–150 Miller units.

Open table in a new tab E. coli MC4100 bearing the indicated Pm*:′lacZfusion and xylS in pERD103 were grown on LB medium with 3MB as described under “Materials and Methods.” In the absence of 3MB, basal activity was 50–150 Miller units. The data correspond to induced levels and are averages of at least six independent determinations, with standard deviations below 20% of the given values. The mutations that resulted in the largest reduction in transcription,i.e. a decrease equal to or greater than 80% of the wild-type activity, were any random substitution of the TGCA sequence between −46/−49 (Table I). This suggests that these nucleotides are critical for XylS-dependent transcription activation of Pm. The substitution by random sequences of the AAAAA sequence located at −41/−45, the TACA sequence between −54/−57, the CGGA sequence between −58/−61, and the TGCA sequence between −67/−70 resulted in a significant decrease in XylS-dependent transcription activation of Pm. The activity of most of the mutant Pm promoters at these locations ranged from approximately 25 to about 65% of the activity of the wild-type promoter (Table I), although certain substitutions had little effect. These results suggest that these sets of bases are less critical than those at the −46/−49 region; however, they may play a direct role in the recognition of the Pm DNA sequences by XylS, or they may contribute to the overall affinity for Pm. We cannot rule out other effects. The third group of mutations, i.e. those that had no effect (or little effect) on transcription from Pm, were found to correspond to the locations of −50/−53, −62/−65, −63/−66, −71/−74, and −75/−78. We also investigated whether the combination of different blocks of mutations had a synergistic effect on XylS-dependent transcription activation from the mutant promoters. The combination of a block of mutations in −46/−49 (TGCA→AGGA) with a block of mutations at −54/−57 (TACA→TTGG) resulted in a mutant Pm promoter (Pm 245) that had no activity at all (Table I). At the −54/−57 block some substitutions had little effect on XylS-dependent transcription from Pm (i.e. Pm 213, 11% reduction), whereas other substitutions at the same block had a clear effect (i.e. Pm 212, 78% reduction). In Pm 244, we combined the block of mutations in Pm 213 with a mutant block that had a moderate effect on the level of expression from Pm (i.e.−67/−70 (TGCA → ACGT)). This combination had cumulative effects (Table I). These results confirmed the essential role of the nucleotides at these positions in XylS-dependent transcription activation from Pm. The transcription initiation point of the mRNA generated from a number of the above Pm mutants promoters was the same that that determined for the wild-type promoter (not shown). This suggests that the mutations analyzed affected the strength of transcription from the mutant promoters. The above series of assays suggested critical, less critical, and irrelevant blocks for the XylS-dependent transcription activation from Pm. We expected that single mutations in irrelevant sets of sequences would have no effect at all on transcriptional activity from Pm, whereas single mutations in the critical and important blocks of sequences would have an effect. A number of bases at the noncritical region were selected to introduce single point mutations: A−51 → G, A−64 → C, G−65 → A, A−75 → C, C−77 → G, and T−78 → G. These mutations, as expected, had little or no effect (<20%) on XylS-dependent transcription from Pm (not shown). Of the less critical boxes (−41/−44, −54/−57, −58/−61, and −67/−70), some of the substitutions (for example, A−42→ T, A−44 → G, A−54 → G, A−54 → T, G−69 → C, and G−69→ T) did not significantly affect activity from Pm (TableII); others had an intermediate effect, reducing the induced XylS-dependent activation of Pm by 20–50%. This effect was observed for the changes C−55→ A, C−55 → G, A−67 → C, and A−67 → T (Table II). Within these sequences, the change T−70 → G resulted in loss of almost 90% of the activity (Table II).Table IISingle point mutations at the Pm promoterPromoterLocation and base changedβ-Galactosidase activityActivity of wild-typeunits%PmWild-type8900100Pm270−42A → T810091Pm 5D−44A → G620070Pm201−46A → T360040Pm203−47C → G185021Pm204−47C → T370042Pm202−48G → C140016Pm205−48G → A9300104Pm200−49T → G205023Pm272−54A → G725081Pm273−54A → T770087Pm274−54A → C550062Pm275−55C → A410046Pm276−55A → G615069Pm277−56C → C9700109Pm108−57T → G955040Pm278−59G → C180020Pm279−60G → T160018Pm280−60G → A7008Pm282−62G → C1001Pm283−63A → C636071Pm287−67A → C450051Pm4−68C → G215024Pm216−69G → C9200103Pm217−69G → T9000101Pm215−70T → G100011Conditions were as in the legend for Table I except that the mutant Pm promoters were those indicated below. Open table in a new tab Conditions were as in the legend for Table I except that the mutant Pm promoters were those indicated below. In the −58/−61 box, the G−59 → C, G−60→ T, and G−60 → A changes had a significant effect on transcription, as shown by the finding that β-galactosidase activity was less than 20% of that seen with the wild-type Pm promoter. A surprising finding was that the G−62 → C change resulted in a mutant Pm promoter that lacked activity. In the critical −46/−49 set of bases, single bp substitutions had a significant effect on activity. The changes A−46 → T, C−47 → G or C−47 → T, G−48→ C, and T−49 → G resulted in a 60–85% decrease in activity. However, the change G−48 → A had little or no effect on transcriptional activity (Table II). When we compared the critical sequences proposed by Kessler et al. (6Kessler B. de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and Gallegoset al. (5Gallegos M.T. Marqués S. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6427-6434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that they had the two TGCA submotifs at −46/−49 and −67/−70 in common (Fig. 1). The hypothesis of Gallegoset al. (5Gallegos M.T. Marqués S. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6427-6434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the TACA submotif between −54/−57 was critical for transcription activation from Pm, whereas Kessler et al. (6Kessler B. de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) suggested that only the −57/−56 nucleotides were of importance (Fig. 1). Our results with single point mutations in the −54 to −57 region showed some effect in some positions, but in no case was the effect large enough to fully impede transcription (Table II). To elucidate the possible role of these four nucleotides, we generated the set of changes involving the −54/−55, −55/−56, −56/−57, and −54/−57 positions. We found that the −54/−55 changes (CA → AC or CA → GT) did not influenced the level of β-galactosidase activity from the mutant Pm promoters. In contrast, the −57/−56 TA → AT change almost completely prevented activity (99% decrease). The combination of mutations at −55/−56 and −54/−57 had an intermediate effect, with activities in the range of 15–38% when the mutation involved the −57 position, and in the range of 40–80% when the changed involved the −56 position (not shown). From these results, we deduced that the −57/−56 bases are critical for the activity of Pm. The XylS protein (12Inouye S. Nakazawa A. Nakazawa T.

Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) belongs to the AraC/XylS family of regulators that comprises more than 100 different proteins involved in transcription stimulation of several cell processes, such as carbon metabolism, pathogenesis, and response to alkylating agents in bacteria (11Gallegos M.T. Schleif R. Bairoch A. Hofmann K. Ramos J.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Members of the family for which in vitro or in vivo footprinting assays are available (AraC, RhaR, RhaS, MelR, SoxS, and Ada) have at least two features in common: they functionin vivo as a dimer, and the stretch of nucleotides covered by a monomer of the regulatory protein at the regulated promoter is between 15 and 20 bp long. However, within this set of bases, short motifs seem to confer critical base recognition for DNA-protein interactions (15Brunelle A. Schleif R. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 607-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Caswell R. Williams J. Lyddiatt A. Busby S. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17Egan S.M.

Schleif R.F. Science. 1990; 250: 528-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This seems also to be the case for Pm/XylS interactions. Our in vivo footprinting analysis and the analysis of transcriptional activity from wild-type and mutant Pm promoters showed that critical nucleotides extended from the −70 position in the 5′-end to at least the −41 position in the 3′ end. Our mutational analysis revealed that within this stretch the XylS recognition sequence seems to be TGCAN6GGNTA, which appears twice in the Pm promoter, between −70 and −56 and between −49 and −35 (Fig. 1). In favor of this proposal is the observation that a tagged XylS-protein immunoadsorbed onto glass beads produced footprintsin vitro, which showed protection of the Gs within the above direct repeat at −48, −59, −60, and −69 (22Kaldalu N. Mandel T. Ustav M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 569-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with our in vivo results. The AraC protein—the best characterized regulator of the family—stimulates transcription as a dimer (23Bustos S.A. Schleif R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5638-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 24Menon K.P. Lee N.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3708-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Schleif R. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 643-665Google Scholar). The consensus sequence for AraC-activable promoters is a direct repetition of the TAGCN7TCCATA motif: each AraC monomer recognizes one of the direct repeats (26Brunelle A. Schleif R. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 607-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 27Carra J.H. Schleif R.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 28Lobell R.B. Schleif R.F. J. Mol.

At the C-terminal end, the regulators of the AraC/XylS family show a highly conserved stretch of about 100 amino acids that seems to be involved in DNA binding and probably in interactions with RNA polymerase (11Gallegos M.T. Schleif R. Bairoch A. Hofmann K. Ramos J.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). One characteristic of members of this family is that they exhibit two possible HTH DNA binding motifs (located at 228–251 and 281–305 in XylS and at 198–217 and 246–264 in AraC). Brunelle and Schleif (15Brunelle A. Schleif R. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 607-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) analyzed these possible HTH motifs with substitutions of several amino acids that should contact DNA in an HTH structure and found evidence for the first one. Niland et al. (30Niland P. Hühne R. Müller-Hill B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), using synthetic oligonucleotides, systematically substituted the bases in the AraC recognition sequence and did gel retardation assays with mutant AraC in each of the possible HTH elements. They showed that the mutant AraC in each of the HTH motifs exhibited altered DNA binding properties. On the basis of their results, these authors proposed that each AraC monomer binds the 5′-TAGC submotif with one of the HTH motifs, and the 3′-TCCATA submotif with the second HTH. If XylS contacts DNA via the two possible HTH elements, all mutant Pm promoters generated in different laboratories can be explained by the following model (Fig. 3): the XylS protein recognizes two submotifs in Pm, TGCA and GGNTA, which are separated from each other by six nucleotides. Each submotif is recognized by the recognition helix of one of the HTH elements of XylS. For the wild-type protein, recognition of direct sequences leads to the formation of a dimer. One monomer recognizes the upstream motif (from −70 to −56) with the two HTH DNA binding elements; the second monomer recognizes mainly the TGCA submotif and interacts with the downstream sequence, where it may compete for binding with the RNA-polymerase (Fig. 3). Mutations at the −46/−49 TGCA submotif result in mutants in which the capacity to activate transcription is impaired because they cannot be contacted properly by XylS. Failure of one of the XylS monomers to interact with this submotif prevents dimer formation and leads to a nonactivable mutant Pm promoter. Pm mutants at the distal TGCA (−67/−70) submotif can be activated weakly by the wild-type XylS protein as a result of the formation of an unstable dimer; however, they can still be induced to a high level of activation by mutant XylS proteins with higher affinity for target sequences than the wild-type regulator (5Gallegos M.T. Marqués S. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6427-6434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is because one of the XylS mutant monomers binds to the downstream motif (−49/−35); and because of the mutation in the XylS, the second monomer is still able to interact well with the GGNTA submotif, and this suffices for dimer formation. The transcriptional activity of mutant Pm promoters with altered GGNTA at −60/−56 sequences is seriously impaired, because failure of one of the monomers to bind correctly prevents dimer stabilization at Pm."

To investigate the signaling mechanism whereby Gβγ regulates the activity of JNK, we transfected kinase-deficient mutants of two JNK kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4) and 7 (MKK7), into human embryonal kidney 293 cells. Gβγ-induced JNK activation was blocked by kinase-deficient MKK4 and to a lesser extent by kinase-deficient MKK7. Moreover, Gβγ increased MKK4 activity by 6-fold and MKK7 activity by 2-fold. MKK4 activation by Gβγ was blocked by dominant-negative Rho and Cdc42, whereas MKK7 activation was blocked by dominant-negative Rac. In addition, Gβγ-mediated MKK4 activation, but not MKK7 activation, was inhibited completely by specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors PP2 and PP1. These results indicate that Gβγ induces JNK activation mainly through MKK4 activation dependent on Rho, Cdc42, and tyrosine kinase, and to a lesser extent through MKK7 activation dependent on Rac.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)1 are proline-directed serine/threonine kinases and play important functions as mediators of cellular responses to a variety of stimuli such as growth factors, cytokines, hormones, and environmental stresses (1Nishida E.

In mammalian cells, MAPKs have been classified into at least four subfamilies: ERK/MAPK, JNK/SAPK, p38 MAPK, and BMK1/ERK5. ERK is activated by many growth factors and cytokines and phosphorylates transcription factors, translational factors, cytoskeleton proteins, and other protein kinases (1Nishida E. Gotoh Y.

Various stressors such as chemical agents and ultraviolet irradiation, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, CD40 ligand, and Fas/CD95 ligand stimulate the activities of JNK and p38 MAPK, which appear to be involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (2Cobb M.H.

JNK phosphorylates transcription factors including c-Jun, Elk-1, and ATF2, whereas p38 MAPK phosphorylates not only transcription factors such as CHOP/GADD153, MEF2C, Elk-1, and ATF2, but also MAPKAP kinases (2Cobb M.H.

BMK1 has been reported to be a redox-regulated kinase and phosphorylates a transcription factor MEF2C, although its physiological role has remained unclear (3Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). MAPK cascades consist of three conserved components: a family of serine/threonine kinases called MAPKKK/MEKK, which activate MAPKK/MEK, which in turn activates MAPK by a simultaneous phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues (1Nishida E.

Raf and Tpl-2 activate ERK through MEK1 and MEK2. On the other hand, it has been shown that overexpression of Tpl-2, MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, MEKK4/MTK1, MAPKKK5/ASK1, TAK1, and MLK family protein kinases induce the activation of JNK and/or p38 MAPK cascade(s). JNK and p38 MAPK are phosphorylated and activated by MKK4/SEK1/JNKK1/SKK1 (2Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol.

Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are composed of α and βγ subunits (Gα and Gβγ) and transduce signals from G protein-coupled receptors to intracellular effectors (5Gilman A.G.

A GDP-bound Gα forms a complex with Gβγ. Upon ligand stimulation, the receptor stimulates the GDP-GTP exchange of Gα, which leads dissociation of Gα·GTP from Gβγ.

In the case of the Gq/11-coupled m1 muscarinic acetylcholine and α1-adrenergic receptors, the activation of ERK is mediated mainly by Gαq/11. Gi-coupled m2 muscarinic acetylcholine and α2-adrenergic receptors, and Gs-coupled β-adrenergic receptor induce the ERK activation primarily through Gβγ. Many studies suggest that a signal transduction pathway from Gβγ to ERK starts at the direct activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ, which increases the activities of Src family tyrosine kinases, in turn leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc (11Gutkind J.S.

On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that JNK is also activated by an agonist stimulation of m1 and m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors expressed in NIH3T3, Rat-1, and COS-7 cells (15Coso O.A.

However, the mechanism by which Gβγ induces JNK activation has not been fully understood, although it has been suggested that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ, Ras and Rac, and STE20-like kinase Pak1 are involved in JNK activation by Gβγ in COS-7 cells (17Coso O.A.

During investigations on JNK activation by stimulation of the m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, we found that its activation was mediated by both Gβγ and Gαq/11 in human embryonal kidney (HEK) 293 cells. We have reported recently that JNK activation by the m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and Gαq/11partially involves the activation of protein kinase C and Src family tyrosine kinases (26Nagao M. Yamauchi J. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22892-22898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To clarify the signaling mechanism of JNK activation by Gβγ, we investigated whether Gβγ stimulates the activities of two JNK kinases MKK4 and MKK7. In this paper, we describe that Gβγ regulates MKK4 and MKK7 differentially through different signaling pathways.

DNA sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencer (LI-COR 4000L) using thermo sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HEK 293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin (Nacalai) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2. Plasmid DNAs were transfected into HEK 293 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The final amount of transfected DNA for a 60-mm dish was adjusted to 30 μg by empty vector, pCMV. Five μg of SRα-HA-JNK, SRα-HA-ERK, pCMV-GST-MKK4, or pCMV-GST-MKK7 was transfected with 0.3 μg of pCMV-m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, 5 μg of pCMV-Gβ1, 5 μg of pCMV-Gγ2, 10 μg of pCMV-Gα11Q209L, 10 μg of pCMV-Gαo, 10 μg of pCMV-FLAG-MKK4K95R, 10 μg of pCMV-FLAG-MKK7K63R, 15 μg of pCMV-RasS17N, 15 μg of pCMV-FLAG-RhoT19N, 15 μg of pCMV-FLAG-RacT17N, or 15 μg of pCMV-FLAG-Cdc42T17N. The cells were starved with serum-free medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Nacalai) for 24 h post-transfection. E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with pET15b-JNK, pET32a-c-Jun-(1–223), or pGEX2T-c-Jun-(1–223). An isolated colony was inoculated in 10 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and shaken at 30 °C overnight. This culture was diluted in 500 ml of medium and grown at 30 °C untilA 600 reached 0.2 and added to 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and further incubated for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −80 °C until use. The frozen cells were suspended and sonicated briefly in 10 ml of extraction buffer A (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0), 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for hexahistidine-JNK and Trx-c-Jun-(1–223) or extraction buffer B (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for GST-c-Jun-(1–223) on ice, and shaken for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 150,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. For the purification of hexahistidine-JNK or Trx-c-Jun-(1–223), the supernatants were applied to NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Inc.) and washed with column buffer A (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0), 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 20 mm imidazole. Hexahistidine-JNK and Trx-c-Jun-(1–223) were eluted with column buffer A containing 200 mm imidazole. Hexahistidine-JNK was diluted to the concentration of 0.3 mg of protein/ml with column buffer A containing 200 mm imidazole before dialysis. For the purification of GST-c-Jun-(1–223), the supernatant was applied to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed with column buffer B (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmEGTA), and eluted with column buffer B containing 10 mmglutathione. The eluate was dialyzed against column buffer B and stored at −80 °C until use. After 24 h of serum starvation, the cells transfected together with SRα-HA-JNK or SRα-HA-ERK were treated with or without carbachol at 37 °C and lysed in 600 μl of lysis buffer A (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 3 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots (500 μg) of the supernatants were mixed with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B preabsorbed with a mouse anti-HA antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated and washed twice with lysis buffer A and twice with reaction buffer A (20 mmHEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, and 0.2 mmβ-glycerophosphate). The precipitates were incubated in 30 μl of reaction buffer A containing 3 μg of GST-c-Jun-(1–223) for JNK assay or 7.5 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma) for ERK assay, 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 4 × Laemmli sample buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 30 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). The boiled samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the radioactivity incorporated into GST-c-Jun-(1–223) or myelin basic protein was measured by an imaging analyzer (Fuji BAS 2000), and detected by autoradiography. After 24 h of serum starvation, the cells transfected together with pCMV-GST-MKK4 or pCMV-GST-MKK7 were treated with or without 10 μm carbachol at 37 °C for 15 min and lysed in 600 μl of lysis buffer A on ice. Aliquots (500 μg) of the supernatants after centrifugation were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 2 h at 4 °C. GST-MKK4 or GST-MKK7 was precipitated by centrifugation and washed with lysis buffer A and reaction buffer A. The precipitates were incubated in 30 μl of reaction buffer A containing 2 μg of hexahistidine-JNK, 10 μg of Trx-c-Jun-(1–223), 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 4 × Laemmli sample buffer and boiling. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the radioactivity incorporated into Trx-c-Jun-(1–223) was measured by an imaging analyzer (Fuji BAS 2000) and detected by autoradiography. When the reaction was performed without hexahistidine-JNK, no obvious incorporation of radioactivity to Trx-c-Jun-(1–223) was observed. Aliquots of cell lysates were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. The boiled samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After the membranes were blocked, the separated proteins were immunoblotted with various antibodies. The bound antibodies were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system, using anti-rabbit or mouse Ig antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford reagent (Nacalai) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. To confirm that the m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor stimulated JNK activity, we transfected plasmids encoding the receptor and the HA-tagged JNK into HEK 293 cells. Using an anti-HA antibody, HA-JNK was immunoprecipitated from lysates of the transfected cells, and the kinase activity was assayed using recombinant GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1–223) as a specific substrate. Fig.1 A shows the time course of JNK activation after stimulation by carbachol, which is an agonist of the receptor. Mock-transfected cells did not respond to carbachol (data not shown). In each experiment, we examined the expression level of HA-JNK by immunoblotting to monitor the transfection efficiency (see Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). The persistent activation of JNK was observed from 10 min to at least 30 min after the receptor stimulation. JNK activation by the m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor was dependent on the concentration of carbachol to maximum response at 10 μmand decreased slightly at 100 μm (Fig.1 B).Figure 3MKK4 is a major mediator of Gβγ-induced JNK activation.

To establish whether this aspect of hepatic gene expression is an inveterate phenomenon, we used transplanted hepatocytes as reporters in dipeptidyl peptidase IV-deficient F344 rats. After integration in liver parenchyma, the position of transplanted cells was shifted from periportal to perivenous areas by targeted hepatic ablations with carbon tetrachloride. In controls, transplanted cells showed greater glucose-6-phosphatase and lesser glycogen content in periportal areas. This pattern was reversed when transplanted cells shifted from periportal to perivenous areas. Transplanted hepatocytes in perivenous areas exhibited inducible cytochrome P450 activity, which was deficient in periportal hepatocytes. Moreover, cytochrome P450 activity was rapidly extinguished in activated hepatocytes when these cells were transplanted into the nonpermissive liver of suckling rat pups. In cells isolated from the normal F344 rat liver, cytochrome P450 inducibility was originally greater in perivenous hepatocytes; however, periportal cells rapidly acquired this facility in culture conditions. These findings indicate that the liver microenvironment exerts supremacy over prior differentiation state of cells in directing position-specific gene expression. Therefore, persistence of specialized hepatocellular function will require interactions with regulatory signals and substrate availability, which bears upon further analysis of liver gene regulation, including in progenitor and/or stem cells.

For example, glutamine synthetase and GLUT-1 are expressed in only a small rim of hepatocytes immediately adjacent to the terminal hepatic venule (7Berthoud V.M. Iwanij V. Garcia A.M. Saez J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: G650-G658PubMed Google Scholar, 9Berkowitz C.M. Shen C.S. Bilir B.M. Guibert E. Gumucio J.J. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1658-1667PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of transcriptional, as well as post-transcriptional, mechanisms in the regulation of specific genes, such as glutamine synthetase, phenobarbitone-inducible cytochrome P450IIB1,2 genes, and GLUT-1 in perivenous areas, has been proposed to reflect compartmentation of specialized function in specific hepatocyte subsets (2Yamauchi M. Potter J.J. Mezey E. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The possibility of other mechanisms, including substrate availability and regulation by soluble circulatory signals led to complex studies of vascular mechanisms, such as alterations in portal blood flow in intact animals (13Wagenaar G.T.M. Chamuleau R.A.F.M. de Haan J.G. Maas M.A.W. de Boer P.A.J. Marx F. Moorman A.F.M. Fredericks W.M. Lamers W.H. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 1144-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The recent ability to repopulate the liver with genetically marked hepatocytes offers unique opportunities for studying physiological processes in the liver (14Gupta S. Rajvanshi P. Bhargava K.K. Kerr A. Prog. Liver Dis. 1996; 14: 199-222PubMed Google Scholar). One transplantation system utilizes F344 rats deficient in dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme activity (DPPIV−) as recipients of DPPIV+ syngeneic hepatocytes (15Rajvanshi P. Kerr A. Bhargava K.K. Burk R.D. Gupta S. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 482-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In this system, transplanted hepatocytes can be conveniently localized by histochemical visualization of DPPIV and dual-label studies can be conducted to address gene expression or cell proliferation mechanisms (16Gupta S. Rajvanshi P. Lee C.-D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5860-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Transplanted hepatocytes are originally located in periportal areas due to their arrival in the liver lobule along with portal blood and entrapment in proximal hepatic sinusoids due to the smaller size of the latter. An important element concerns integration of transplanted hepatocytes in the liver parenchyma, as shown by the presence of hybrid plasma membrane structures, such as gap junctions and bile canaliculi among conjoint transplanted and host hepatocytes (14Gupta S. Rajvanshi P. Bhargava K.K. Kerr A. Prog. Liver Dis. 1996; 14: 199-222PubMed Google Scholar). Transplanted hepatocytes can be induced to replicate, especially under conditions involving loss of host hepatocytes, such that toxins producing perivenous liver injury that would spare transplanted cells in periportal areas cause these to proliferate, along with uninjured host hepatocytes (17Gupta S. Rajvanshi P. Aragone E. Yerneni P.R. Lee C.D. Burk R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Repeated self-limited liver injury to the host can induce multiple proliferation cycles in transplanted hepatocytes. During these cycles of liver injury, transplanted hepatocytes migrate from periportal toward perivenous areas, in a process resembling “wound repair.” We considered that examination of position-dependent gene regulation mechanisms in the repopulated liver would be instructive. The fate of transplanted cells induced to change their position in the liver lobule could be compared with control animals receiving cells from the same donor animal but without undergoing any change from their original periportal location. This would allow analysis of cell age-related versus position-specific mechanisms in gene regulation. Also, we reasoned that transplantation of fully differentiated mature hepatocytes into another microenvironment, such as the liver of recent-born pups, would allow further analysis of position-specific gene expression. Finally, we asked whether gene expression could be regulated in similar fashions in hepatocytes isolated from periportal and perivenous areas of the liver lobule, if their microenvironment were altered. The latter studies were facilitated by our recent characterization of hepatocytes fractionated from periportal or perivenous areas of the same animal followed by analysis in cell culture (18Rajvanshi P. Liu D. Ott M. Gagandeep S. Schilsky M. Gupta S. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Eight- to 10-week old DPPIV− F344 rats weighing 160–180 g and 3-day-old DPPIV− pups weighing 7–9 g were provided by the Special Animal Core of the Marion Bessin Liver Research Center. Normal F344 rats were obtained from the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD) and weighed 250–300 g when used. Animals were utilized in groups of at least three to four animals each under protocols approved by the institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health publication number 86-23, revised 1985). To induce perivenous hepatic injury (19Lindros K.O. Cai Y.A. Penttila K.E. Hepatology. 1990; 12: 1092-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), 1.45 ml/kg carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) was administered intramuscularly after diluting 1:1 (v/v) in mineral oil (Sigma). To induce CYP450 activity in hepatocyte recipients, 0.5 g/liter phenobarbitone (Sigma) was administered in drinking water for 4 days to adult rats, which amounted to 10–12.5 mg of phenobarbitone/rat/day as 20–25 ml water was consumed per 24 h. Hepatocyte donors were treated with phenobarbitone as above for 7 days. Rat pups received 1 mg of phenobarbitone intramuscularly for 7 days with continued nursing by mothers. The animals were housed in the Institute for Animal Studies at Albert Einstein College of Medicine under 14 h light, 10 h dark cycles and received standard pelleted food and water ad libitum. Cells were isolated from F344 rats with two-step perfusion using 0.025% (w/v) collagenase, as described previously (15Rajvanshi P. Kerr A. Bhargava K.K. Burk R.D. Gupta S. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 482-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The cell viability was tested by trypan blue dye exclusion and attachment to tissue culture plastic in RPMI 1640 medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). To fractionate cells, Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS)1containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma), as described (18Rajvanshi P. Liu D. Ott M. Gagandeep S. Schilsky M. Gupta S. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were suspended in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium, and 1–1.5 × 107 cells were placed at the top of Percoll gradients in 15-ml polystyrene tubes, followed by centrifugation under 1000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells localizing in discrete bands were designated H4 (at the bottom) and H2 (toward the top). These cells were obtained by pipetting and washed twice in RPMI 1640 medium. Characterization of fractionated hepatocytes included flow cytometric determination of cell ploidy, analysis of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, glucose-6-phosphatase (Glu-6-P), glycogen, and P450 activities by histochemical and immunocytochemical methods, as described previously (18Rajvanshi P. Liu D. Ott M. Gagandeep S. Schilsky M. Gupta S. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Animals were anesthetized with inhaled ether (Fisher). Adult rats received 2 × 107cells, and pups received 0.5 × 106 cells via spleen, as described previously (15Rajvanshi P. Kerr A. Bhargava K.K. Burk R.D. Gupta S. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 482-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). After closing the abdomen, animals were monitored closely until full recovery. Pups were returned to the mothers immediately after recovery from anesthesia. To localize F344 rat hepatocytes in DPPIV− animals, histochemical staining was performed on frozen tissue sections as reported previously (15Rajvanshi P. Kerr A. Bhargava K.K. Burk R.D. Gupta S. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 482-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Integrations of transplanted cells in the liver parenchyma were demonstrated by colocalization of DPPIV activity and bile canalicular ATPase activity. Tissues were counterstained with hematoxylin. To document the position of transplanted cells in tissues, serial wedge liver biopsies were obtained from individual CCl4-treated adult rats. The position of transplanted cells in the liver of pups was verified by sampling of animals. To determine the position of transplanted cells in liver lobules, morphometric analysis was performed with multiple microphotographs using a standard magnification (× 40). At a minimum, 50 liver lobules were analyzed per animal with determination of the number of transplanted cells in various zones of the liver lobule. In addition, the number of cells in each liver lobule was determined. The actual distance of transplanted cells from the center of the nearest portal vein was measured in microphotographs. To document whether equivalent areas of the liver were analyzed, we measured portal vein diameters and the distance between portal and central veins. Colocalization studies were performed to determine gene expression in transplanted cells. Glu-6-P activity was determined in unfixed cryostat tissue, followed by acetone-chloroform fixation and DPPIV histochemistry for localizing transplanted cells, as described previously (15Rajvanshi P. Kerr A. Bhargava K.K. Burk R.D. Gupta S. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 482-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Tissue glycogen was determined by first performing DPPIV histochemistry in cryostat sections fixed with ethyl alcohol-acetic acid followed by incubation in 1% aqueous periodic acid for 5 min and Schiff's reagent for another 5 min (18Rajvanshi P. Liu D. Ott M. Gagandeep S. Schilsky M. Gupta S. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After washing repeatedly in 0.5% sodium bisulfite, slides were immersed in running tap water for 10 min. To verify the specificity of glycogen staining, control tissues were preincubated with salivary amylase. The intensity of staining for Glu-6-P and glycogen was arbitrarily graded from 0 (negative) to 4+ (maximally positive). To demonstrate differences in gene expression, at least 50 cells per condition were graded in each animal. A polyclonal goat antibody directed against rat CYPIIB1 isoform (Gentest Inc., Woburn, MA) was used for analyzing phenobarbitone-induced P450 expression (18Rajvanshi P. Liu D. Ott M. Gagandeep S. Schilsky M. Gupta S. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cryostat tissue sections or cytospun hepatocytes were fixed in alcohol-acetone (99:1 v/v) and ethanol alone at −−20 °C for 5 min each. Tissues were air-dried, rehydrated in PBS, blocked with nonimmune goat serum (diluted 1:20 in PBS) for 20 min, and incubated with the primary antibody (diluted 1:20 in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS three times, antibody binding was localized with peroxidase-conjugated goat IgG for 30 min at room temperature using the diaminobenzidine substrate (Sigma). Chemicals and reagents were from Sigma. Freshly isolated hepatocytes were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates coated with rat tail collagen (0.5–1 × 105 cells/cm2). Cells were allowed to attach for 1–2 h in RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and 10−8mdexamethasone. To induce P450 activity, either 2 mmphenobarbitone or 2 μm 3-methylcholanthrene were added to the culture medium immediately after cell attachment, with replacements of these additives on days 2 and 3 of culture. P450 activity was assayed 1, 2, 3, and 5 days after initiating hepatocyte cultures, according to an assay described previously with minor modifications (20Donato M.T. Gomez-Lechon M.J. Castell J.V. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with cold PBS followed by the addition of 8 μm 7-ethoxyresorufin and 10 μm dicumarol with incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. From some wells, culture medium and cells were harvested separately, whereas only medium was harvested from other wells for sequential studies. To 0.3-ml aliquots of culture medium, 0.2 ml of ethanol was added, and samples were centrifuged for 10 min in a microcentrifuge to solubilize resorufin products, followed by fluorescence measurements at 530 nm (excitation) and 590 nm (emission). Purified resorufin was used to generate standard curves in linear range and data normalized by measuring protein in aliquots with the Bio-Rad assay. Studies using adult rats addressed gene expression in unprimed transplanted hepatocytes. The strategy was to transplant hepatocytes isolated from a single donor into 18 DPPIV− F344 rats. The animals were divided into two groups of nine rats each. One group served as controls with cells in periportal areas, since intrasplenic injection is known to deposit hepatocytes into these areas (15Rajvanshi P. Kerr A. Bhargava K.K. Burk R.D. Gupta S. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 482-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The other animal group was given three doses of CCl4at 10-day intervals to cause perivenous injury and shift the position of transplanted hepatocytes from periportal to perivenous areas during the ensuing liver repair (Fig.1 A). A second experiment concerned transplantation of hepatocytes into suckling DPPIV− rat pups with P450 induction by treating the donor rat with phenobarbitone for 7 days. These hepatocytes were transplanted into nine 3-day-old DPPIV− pups (Fig. 1 B). The pups were killed in groups of 2–3 animals each at 2 h, 7 days, and 4 weeks after cell transplantation. The pups received phenobarbitone daily for 7 days each prior to being killed at 7 days and 4 weeks after cell transplantation. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. SigmaStat 2.0 software was used for data analysis (Jandel Corp., San Rafael, CA). The significance of differences was analyzed as appropriate by Student's t test, Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney rank sum tests, or analysis of variance. The experiments were first conducted in adult rats. After transplantation via spleen, hepatocytes engrafted in the liver with integrations in the hepatic parenchyma, which was documented by colocalization of bile canalicular DPPIV and ATPase activities (not shown). In normal control rats, transplanted hepatocytes were distributed mainly in periportal areas of the liver. This pattern was generally unchanged throughout the 2-year duration of the studies (Fig.2). The findings were compatible with previous studies of liver repopulation in normal mice (21Gupta S. Aragona E. Vemuru R.P. Bhargava K. Burk R.D. Roy Chowdhury J. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, at 24 months, transplanted hepatocytes showed somewhat larger cell clusters in F344 rats, which indicated the possibility of spontaneous cell proliferation in this setting, although transplanted cells still remained in periportal locations. In contrast, in response to CCl4-induced liver injury, the position of transplanted cells changed progressively. In this situation, transplanted cells were localized in periportal areas (zone 1), deeper inside (zone 2), as well as perivenous areas (zone 3) of the liver lobule. Detailed morphometric analysis of sequential biopsies in three animals showed that at the end of all three CCl4 treatments, significantly fewer transplanted hepatocytes were in zone 1 of the liver lobule, whereas more hepatocytes were in zone 3 (TableI). To assure that various tissue samples were comparable, we evaluated the dimensions of the liver lobules under study by using portal vein diameters and the distance between portal and central veins as reference points. These parameters were not different in the tissues analyzed. The mean distance of transplanted cells from the center of portal vein shifted significantly after CCl4. Also, the overall number of transplanted hepatocytes increased in the liver, consistent with cell proliferation during recovery from CCl4-induced liver injury. Analysis of the number of transplanted cells showed 6 ± 2 cells per liver lobule before CCl4 and 15 ± 3 cells per liver lobule after the completion of all three CCl4 treatments,p < 0.02 (t test). However, some cell clusters in CCl4 recipients were large and contained >100–200 cells each. The findings were compatible with the ability to shift the position of transplanted hepatocytes from periportal areas to additional locations without altering the overall organization of the liver lobule.Table IRelative position of transplanted hepatocytes in the liver lobuleParametersBefore CCl4 treatmentAfter CCl4treatmentp values (t test)Lobular cell distributionsZone 1 (%)90 ± 1215 ± 9<0.001Zone 2 (%)25 ± 2134 ± 17NSZone 3 (%)1 ± 152 ± 25<0.02Distance of transplanted cells from portal vein (μm)115 ± 18479 ± 123<0.001Portal vein diameter (μm)53 ± 3345 ± 20NSaNS, not significant.Distance between portal and central veins (μm)702 ± 239689 ± 273NSa NS, not significant. Open table in a new tab Although Glu-6-P and glycogen are present in hepatocytes throughout the liver lobule, during previous studies to demonstrate gene expression in transplanted cells, we recognized gradients of expression in the F344 rat liver. We found that while Glu-6-P showed greater histochemical activity in periportal areas (3+ to 4+ grade), compared with perivenous locations (0 to 2+ grade), this situation was reversed in the case of glycogen (Fig.3). These findings allowed us to determine whether gene expression was regulated in transplanted hepatocytes following shifts in their position. In normal control animals, as well as in animals before CCl4 treatments, periportally located transplanted hepatocytes showed greater Glu-6-P activity (3+ to 4+), similar to adjacent host hepatocytes, compared with host hepatocytes in perivenous areas (0 to 2+). In contrast, when the position of transplanted hepatocytes was shifted toward perivenous areas, Glu-6-P expression began to progressively decline, such that in hepatocytes immediately adjacent to the terminal hepatic venule, Glu-6-P expression was markedly attenuated (p < 0.01,t test). Interestingly, in the CCl4-treated liver where transplanted cells were simultaneously localized elsewhere, there was much greater Glu-6-P activity in periportal areas, indicating that the change in gene expression was not simply due to some other cellular alteration during CCl4-induced proliferation. Furthermore, changes in the glycogen content of transplanted hepatocytes mirrored those of Glu-6-P. In transplanted hepatocytes situated in periportal areas, as well as adjacent host hepatocytes, less glycogen was visualized (1+ to 2+) compared with hepatocytes in perivenous areas (3+ to 4+), p < 0.01, ttest. This situation became reversed when transplanted hepatocytes shifted to perivenous areas. To demonstrate regulation of cytochrome P450 system, we analyzed changes in response to induction by phenobarbitone. Hepatocyte recipients were given phenobarbitone for 4 days immediately before sacrificing animals at 24 months. Immunolocalization of CYPIIB1 activity, along with DPPIV staining to localize transplanted cells, showed that whereas host and transplanted hepatocytes in perivenous areas were induced by phenobarbitone, neither transplanted nor host hepatocytes in periportal areas could express CYPIIB1 activity (not shown). The findings were again compatible with regulation of gene expression in transplanted hepatocytes by the ambient microenvironment of the liver lobule. These studies were performed in suckling F344 rat pups to elucidate regulation of gene expression in hepatocytes isolated from adult rats. The premise was that transplanted hepatocytes would engraft and function in the developing liver. Immediately after injection of cells into the spleen, transplanted hepatocytes appeared in portal areas and hepatic sinusoids (Fig. 4). Dual staining for bile canalicular DPPIV and ATPase activities showed that transplanted hepatocytes were integrated in the liver parenchyma at 7 days of transplantation. The suckling rat liver showed a gradient of Glu-6-P, which was similar to the adult rat liver, and supported abundant expression of Glu-6-P activity in transplanted hepatocytes (3+ to 4+). In contrast, hepatic glycogen stores were less pronounced (1+) in the suckling rat liver and showed no gradients in the liver lobule at 7 days of age. This was reflected in transplanted hepatocytes, many of which showed very little glycogen. However, glycogen staining became more pronounced in both transplanted and host hepatocytes at the age of 4 weeks (2+ to 3+), consistent with further maturation of the liver. The regulation of phenobarbitone-inducible CYPIIB1 activity in the suckling liver was instructive. When hepatocytes were isolated from a donor with extensive P450 induction following 7 days of treatment with phenobarbitone, 80–90% cells showed immunostaining for CYPIIB1 activity. Upon transplantation of these cells into the suckling rat liver, CYPIIB1 expression was present in transplanted cells at 1 h of transplantation (Fig. 5). However, all transplanted cells rapidly lost CYPIIB1 activity in the suckling rat liver subsequently (p < 0.001, Chi-square) when animals were studied at 1 week after cell transplantation, despite phenobarbitone administration to pups for these 7 days. Moreover, P450 activity did not return in transplanted hepatocytes at 4 weeks, although perivenous cells in the suckling liver were faintly stained with anti-CYPIIB1 at this time following 7 days of phenobarbitone treatment. The findings indicated that in response to signals emanating from the nonpermissive host hepatic microenvironment, P450 activation was lost in transplanted hepatocytes. We reasoned that if external signals were important determinants in hepatic gene regulation, it should be possible to test whether specific function could be induced in hepatocytes isolated from permissive and nonpermissive areas of the liver lobule. For this purpose, we utilized Percoll gradients to isolate hepatocytes enriched in periportal or perivenous areas of the same liver. In parallel experiments, cell fractions were characterized by a variety of parameters, including differences in their ploidy states and phenotypic analysis to ascertain the lobular origin (18Rajvanshi P. Liu D. Ott M. Gagandeep S. Schilsky M. Gupta S. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The hepatocytes were isolated from a normal F344 rat. Perivenous hepatocytes exhibited greater abundance of tetraploid nuclei on flow cytometry, greater glycogen content and P450 activity, and lesser Glu-6-P activity. None of the isolated hepatocytes expressed γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, indicating an absence of contamination with biliary cells. When these isolated hepatocytes were cultured with phenobarbitone and 3-methylcholanthrene, CYP450 activity using resorufin conversion as a measure was not apparent at 24 h of cell culture. Subsequently, although basal P450 activity was greater in cultured perivenous hepatocytes (H2 fraction) (up to 3-fold greater,p < 0.001), periportal hepatocytes (H4 fraction) rapidly acquired this facility in culture conditions. Indeed, the relative magnitude of P450 induction in both cell fractions was comparable after 2, 3, and 5 days in culture, although P450 inducibility declined in cultured hepatocytes with time (Fig.6). In some experiments, 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible P450 activity was greater in H4 cell fraction compared with H2 cell fraction (p < 0.001,t test) at 2 days in culture, but then became similar in both cell fractions. These findings establish that signals emanating from the microenvironment play critical roles in directing liver gene expression. Our findings are novel in respect with the use of transplanted hepatocytes as reporters to analyze physiological mechanisms in the liver. Also, the results demonstrate unequivocally that hepatocytes can both acquire and lose specialized functions depending upon the permissiveness or otherwise of the microenvironment. All three of our approaches, namely shifting the position of reporter hepatocytes in the adult liver, switching hepatocytes from a permissive environment to a nonpermissive one, and analysis of hepatocytes from perivenous and periportal areas in the neutral territory of identical culture conditions and substrate availability provided mutually compatible results. Our studies were greatly facilitated by the recent development of novel cell transplantation systems and insights into mechanisms of liver repopulation with transplanted hepatocytes (14Gupta S. Rajvanshi P. Bhargava K.K. Kerr A. Prog. Liver Dis. 1996; 14: 199-222PubMed Google Scholar). A most critical feature concerned the ability of transplanted hepatocytes to enter hepatic cords in the adult liver, which was demonstrated previously (16Gupta S. Rajvanshi P. Lee C.-D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5860-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), as well as in the neonatal liver, as shown here. While transplanted hepatocytes can proliferate extensively in the diseased liver with constant depletion of host hepatocytes (22Rhim J.A. Sandgren E.P. Degen J.L. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Science. 1994; 263: 1149-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 23Overturf K. Al-Dhalimy M. Ou C.-N. Finegold M. Grompe M. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1273-1280PubMed Google Scholar), in the setting of self-limited liver injury, such as acute CCl4toxicity, proliferation of transplanted hepatocytes was tightly regulated (17Gupta S. Rajvanshi P. Aragone E. Yerneni P.R. Lee C.D. Burk R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Although it could potentially be argued that the progeny of transplanted hepatocytes could have shown differences in gene regulation mechanisms, such was not the case in our experience. Despite significantly increased sizes of hepatocyte clusters in animals treated repeatedly with CCl4, gene expression in transplanted hepatocytes resembled that in adjacent host cells. During extensive repopulation of the mouse liver, transplanted adult hepatocytes have also been shown to display gene expression patterns consistent with their position in the liver lobule (23Overturf K. Al-Dhalimy M. Ou C.-N. Finegold M. Grompe M. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1273-1280PubMed Google Scholar). A multitude of studies established previously that periportal and perivenous hepatocytes differ in their biochemical capacities (18Rajvanshi P. Liu D. Ott M. Gagandeep S. Schilsky M. Gupta S. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar,24Bengtsson G. Julkunen A. Penttila K.E. Lindros K.O. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Our findings of differences in the abundance of Glu-6-P and glycogen content were compatible with models of metabolic zonation in the liver (30Jungermann K. Thurman R.G. Enzyme (Basel). 1992; 46: 33-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Groothuis G.M. Meijer D.K. Enzyme (Basel). 1992; 46: 94-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It was interesting that the periportal preference of Glu-6-P activity in the suckling rat liver was similar to the adult liver, whereas glycogen stores were less pronounced and showed no zonal predilection in very young suckling pups. Metabolic activities localized preferentially in periportal areas are broadly classified to be involved in glucose and amino acid utilization and urea, cholesterol and bile synthesis, etc., whereas glycogen, fatty acid and glutamine synthesis, and xenobiotic disposal are preferentially localized in perivenous areas (30Jungermann K. Thurman R.G. Enzyme (Basel). 1992; 46: 33-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Groothuis G.M. Meijer D.K. Enzyme (Basel). 1992; 46: 94-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our findings concerning restriction of P450 activity in perivenous areas of the intact adult liver are compatible with metabolic zonation of gene expression. This peculiar zonal selection of gene expression has been correlated with structural features of cells, e.g. the occurrence of greater hepatocellular ploidy in perivenous areas of the liver lobule (32Schmucker D.L. J. Electron Microsc. Technique. 1990; 14: 106-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similarly, post-translationally regulated distributions of gene products in cellular compartments and plasma membrane domains have been interpreted as unique position-specific features of some hepatocytes (2Yamauchi M. Potter J.J. Mezey E. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). On the other hand, our findings concerning transplantation of P450-expressing hepatocytes in suckling pups indicated that this activity was reversible. The findings suggested regulation at a functional rather than structural level. Moreover, we found that hepatocytes isolated from periportal areas of the liver were able to rapidly acquire P450 inducibility in the presence of appropriate substrates. The findings were compatible with the previous demonstrations of phenobarbitone-inducible CYPIIB1 mRNA expression in the developing rat liver (33Omiecinski C.J. Hassett C. Costa P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 462-470PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with in situmRNA hybridization showed that CYPIIB1 mRNAs were distributed across the hepatic lobule in this situation, except for periportal cells, as in our studies of adult rats with immunostainable CYPIIB1 protein following phenobarbitone induction. The lack of immunostainable CYPIIB1 in our suckling rats is in agreement with post-transcriptional regulation if previous mRNA expression data are extrapolated (33Omiecinski C.J. Hassett C. Costa P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 462-470PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, our findings should help understand previously unreconciled results concerning regulation of hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase activity. In vivo studies showed that alcohol dehydrogenase localized principally in perivenous areas of the adult liver (1Cereghini S. Raymondjean M. Carrance A.G. Herbomel P. Yaniv M. Cell. 1987; 50: 627-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In contrast, studies using periportal and perivenous hepatocytes isolated by enzymatic digestion of the liver showed that the rates of ethanol metabolism were similar in both cell fractions (34Vaananen H. Lindros K.O. Alcoholism Clin. Exp. Res. 1985; 9: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The studies suggest that position-specific gene expression must reflect the consequence of complex interactions among cellular transcription factors, signals from adjacent cells, extracellular matrix components, hormones, intermediary metabolites, etc. Regulation of position-specific gene expression in the liver by manipulating ambient oxygen or hormone concentrations has been documented (35Oinonen T. Mode A. Lobie P.E. Lindros K.O. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 36Kietzmann T. Jungermann K. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1997; 13: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed changes in the distribution of specific cellular transcription factors, as well as abundance of cytokines in various zones of the liver lobule (37Lindros K.O. Oinonen T. Issakainen J. Nagy P. Thorgeirsson S.S. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1997; 13: 57-62Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 38Fang C. Lindros K.O. Badger T.M. Ronis M.J. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1304-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Similarly, gradients of extracellular matrix components are recognized in the liver and may have important influences upon hepatic gene expression (39Reid L.M. Fiorino A. Sigal S. Brill S. Holst P. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 1198-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cell-cell interactions have also been shown to regulate hepatic gene expression,e.g. in cocultures of hepatic stellate cells and hepatocytes, differentiated hepatocyte functions are retained in a superior fashion (40Rojkind M. Novikoff P.M. Greenwel P. Rubin J. Rojas-Valencia L. de Carvalho A.C. Stockert R. Spray D. Hertzberg E.L. Wolkoff A.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1508-1520PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that hepatocytes do not possess irrevocable mechanisms to account for position-specific gene expression patterns and are in agreement more with a major role of external influences, albeit not necessarily exclusive ones. The results have implications upon further analysis of liver gene regulation and characterization of specific liver cell subpopulations. For instance, there is burgeoning interest in searching for hepatic stem cells. Cell lines capable of differentiating into hepatocytes have been obtained from progenitor liver cells (41Coleman W.B. McCullough K.D. Esch G.L. Faris R.A. Hixson D.C. Smith G.J. Grisham J.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 353-359PubMed Google Scholar). One goal of these general efforts is to establish mechanisms for bio-artificial liver devices to support the failing liver, which would benefit from suitable devices that can reproduce the hepatic microenvironment and offer greater preservation of desired functions in immobilized cells. Other investigations are aimed at using progenitor cells for cell and gene therapy approaches. In undertaking characterization of progenitor liver cells with analysis of gene regulation, our findings concerning the effects of microenvironment on cell differentiation should be especially germane."

To investigate the basis of the ∼30-fold difference in adrenodoxin binding, two sets of P450c27 mutants were generated, expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified. Mutations of one set were within the putative adrenodoxin-binding site containing conserved lysine residues also crucial in P450scc for binding adrenodoxin.

These monooxygenases metabolize different endogenous and exogenous substrates including steroids, fatty acids, drugs, and xenobiotics. Eukaryotic P450s are membrane-bound enzymes residing either in the endoplasmic reticulum or the inner mitochondrial membrane. Microsomal P450s accept electrons from NADPH through NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (P450 reductase) while mitochondrial P450s receive electrons from NADPH via a two-protein redox chain consisting of ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin. Whereas different forms of P450s are necessary to metabolize different substrates, a single form of P450 reductase for microsomal P450s and ferredoxin for mitochondrial P450s function as P450 redox partners.Mammalian mitochondrial P450s are involved in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, the production of bile acids, and the formation of active and inactive vitamin D3 metabolites. Among mitochondrial P450 systems that involved the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone (P450scc) in bovine adrenal cortex and other steroidogenic tissues have been most extensively characterized because of its relative abundance.

Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22877-22882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of these residues for Adx binding was implicated initially by chemical modification studies (5Tuls J. Geren L. Millet F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16421-16425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tsubaki M. Iwamoto Y. Hiwatashi A. Ichikawa Y. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6899-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The fact that the key basic residues identified in P450scc are conserved (as lysine or arginine) among all mitochondrial but not in microsomal P450s (Fig.1) suggests that a similar ferredoxin-binding domain is present in all mitochondrial P450s.Recently, we have overexpressed P450c27 (CYP27A1), another mitochondrial P450, in E. coli (7Pikuleva I.A. Björkhem I. Waterman M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This ubiquitous enzyme participates in bile acid biosynthetic pathways catalyzing multiple oxidation reactions at the C-27 atom of steroids in the classical (hepatic) pathway (8Björkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 455-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cholesterol in the alternative (peripheral) pathway (9Anderson K.E. Kok E. Javitt N.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1972; 51: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The present study was initiated by the observation that the two mitochondrial P450s, P450scc and P450c27, show significantly different elution times from Adx-Sepharose, an affinity resin used for purification of both. Quantitation of the binding affinities using a spectral binding assay revealed an almost 30-fold difference in apparent K s values between these two P450s for ferredoxin, with P450c27 binding more tightly. Utilizing site-directed mutagenesis we have established the primary basis of this difference. Three positively charged residues of P450c27 (Lys-354, Lys-358, and Arg-418) play essential roles in binding Adx. Two of them (Lys-354 and Lys-358) are aligned with residues previously identified as the 2 residues essential for ferredoxin binding to P450scc (4Wada A. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22877-22882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while Arg-418 is a newly identified residue important for the interaction of mitochondrial P450c27 with Adx. This residue aligns with Ser-402 in P450scc. The much tighter binding of P450c27 to Adx due to the presence of the additional positively charged residue may be important because of the low levels of ubiquitously expressed P450c27 and Adx relative to much higher levels of P450scc and Adx in steroidogenic mitochondria.DISCUSSIONDetails of the interactions of different mitochondrial P450s with their common redox partner ferredoxin are derived from chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis studies using bovine P450scc. Finding that the key basic residues for interaction with Adx in P450scc are conserved among all mitochondrial P450s suggests that this interaction involves a similar conserved binding domain. In the present study it is confirmed with a second mitochondrial P450, human P450c27, that these conserved lysine residues are important for Adx binding. However, it is also shown that an additional positively charged residue (Arg-418) participates in Adx binding, leading to tighter binding of Adx to P450c27 than to P450scc. This residue is located outside the immediate environment of the conserved lysine residues.Binding of Adx to P450c27 exhibits several differences compared with that to P450scc. First, it is 30-fold tighter. Despite this, the contribution of each of the conserved lysines (Lys-354 and Lys-358) is approximately an order of magnitude weaker than in P450scc. For example, in P450scc mutation of K338A resulted in about a 250-fold increase in apparent K s value, while the replacement of the corresponding lysine residue in P450c27 (K354A) led to only about a 20-fold change of K s. A smaller 150-fold increase in K s was observed upon the mutation of the second conserved lysine in P450scc (K342Q) with ∼20-fold increase inK s arising from mutation of the corresponding K358A in P450c27. The finding that P450c27 binds more tightly to Adx than P450scc and that the conserved lysine residues in P450c27 play a smaller role in Adx binding than in P450scc suggests that additional residue(s) in P450c27 participate in the interaction with Adx. At first we checked the effect of differences in the primary sequence between the two P450s in the 15-amino acid stretch containing the conserved lysine residues important for Adx binding. Between bovine P450scc and human P450c27 there are three differences in this stretch (Val-356, Leu-357, and Tyr-364) and replacement of Val-356 and Leu-357 in P450c27 with the corresponding residue in P450scc (Fig. 1) showed no significant effect on Adx binding. Neither the Y364H nor V356S/L357I/Y364H mutants were detected using immunoblotting analysis during expression in E. coli. Apparently Tyr-364 in P450c27 is important for maintaining structural integrity of the protein, and P450c27 cannot be properly folded when this residue is replaced with histidine, the residue present in P450scc. Mutation of V356S and L357I actually slightly improved binding of Adx to P450c27 indicating that these 2 residues do not contribute to tighter complex formation between Adx and P450c27. Despite the fact that affinity to Adx was increased, the V356S and L357I mutants showed moderately decreased enzymatic activity implying that these mutations directly or indirectly affect some other steps in the P450 catalytic cycle. Because Val-356 and Leu-357 are located within the Adx-binding site, their mutation could affect the rate of electron transfer and hence the turnover number. Thus, while the conserved lysine residues are important for Adx binding to P450c27, additional residues essential for this are located outside this region.To identify these additional residues we utilized the results of a comparative analysis of crystal structures of three bacterial P450s (19Hasemann C.A. Kurumbail R.G. Boddupalli S.S. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1995; 3: 41-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). This analysis argues that the general structure of eukaryotic P450s resembles that of the bacterial enzymes, and most relevant to this study identifies the ERR triad and the meander region as typical features of P450 structure (19Hasemann C.A. Kurumbail R.G. Boddupalli S.S. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1995; 3: 41-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The meander region was proposed to be a likely site of redox-partner interactions (19Hasemann C.A. Kurumbail R.G. Boddupalli S.S. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1995; 3: 41-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Mutation of the positively charged Arg-418, predicted to be located in the P450c27 meander region and conserved in the CYP27A1 family decreased the affinity of P450c27 to Adx ∼20-fold, a comparable effect to that caused by the mutation of conserved Lys-354 and Lys-358. This mutant was expressed at the same level as the wild-type enzyme, did not exhibit any abnormalities during purification, showed a peak at 448 nm without any trace of a peak at 420 nm in the reduced CO-difference spectrum and was able to support the activity in the reconstituted system, although full activity was not achieved because of the lower affinity to Adx. This mutation did not cause any major structural perturbations in the protein and the substantial decrease of affinity for Adx is most likely the result of the neutralization of a positive charge at position 418. The 1.7 kcal/mol increase in apparent free energy of binding caused by this mutation is not significantly different from the value of 1.97 kcal/mol, characterizing Δ(ΔG) between P450scc-Adx and P450c27-Adx. Such close correspondence of these two values implies that Arg-418 is the most important among the residue(s) in P450c27 which confer(s) the additional strength for Adx binding. Mutation of His-414 which is also located in the meander region, only 3 residues away from Arg-418, to Thr the corresponding residue in P450scc, did not decrease but slightly improved binding to Adx, indicating that His-414 is not the additional residue in P450c27 important for the interaction with Adx.The present studies raise new questions regarding the interaction of mitochondrial P450s with the common ferredoxin redox partner. The most important one is: what is the physiological significance of greatly different affinities of mitochondrial P450s for ferredoxin? Besides the present work demonstrating that two mitochondrial P450s have significantly different Adx-binding properties, there are several studies showing that mitochondrial P45011β (CYP11B1) has lower affinity for Adx than P450scc (11Cupp J.R. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1602-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yamazaki T. McNamara B.C. Jefcoate C.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 95: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Becker V. Bernhardt R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4883-4888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, differences in binding affinity for ferredoxin may be a general phenomenon among mammalian mitochondrial P450s. Perhaps the different levels of expression of ferredoxin in different tissues and the tissue distribution pattern of mitochondrial P450s provide an explanation. The lower the level of expression of ferredoxin and P450 in a given tissue (liver or kidney, for example) the higher the affinity between two proteins and vice versa. In tissues where several mitochondrial P450s are present simultaneously at relatively high levels (P450scc and P45011β in adrenal cortex), different affinities may serve to regulate the preferential partitioning of electron transfer toward one P450. If the level of expression of two P450s is significantly different, higher binding affinity of the more poorly expressed P450 is a way to compete efficiently for ferredoxin.Another unanswered question is how many binding sites for Adx are in mitochondrial P450s, and if there are several sites, are they formed by the same stretch of primary sequence in different mitochondrial P450s? In the absence of the tertiary structure of P450c27 we do not know if Lys-354, Lys-358, and Arg-418 are part of one site. If the overall tertiary structure of P450c27 is not too different from that of bacterial P450s, P450cam, P450terp, and P450BM-3, then these 3 residues should be spatially close to each other forming a single binding site. Our data also indicates that there may be other residues in P450c27 interacting with Adx which form a separate binding site, which contributes much less to Adx binding than Lys-354, Lys-358, or Arg-418. Thus, in mitochondrial P450s with high affinity for Adx there may be two sites for interaction with Adx, one being common and the other one being specific for each P450.Site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that four conserved negatively charged residues (Asp-72, Glu-73, Asp-76, and Asp-79) located within the highly acidic region (positions 68–86) in mitochondrial ferredoxins are important for binding of human ferredoxin to bovine P450scc (18Coghlan V.M. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18606-18612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contribution of these residues to the affinity for P450scc is different being the greatest for Asp-76 and Asp-79 (K s for D76N and D79A mutants was increased ∼6- and 8-fold, respectively) followed by Asp-72 and Glu-73 (3- and 4-fold increase of K s for D72N and E73Q mutants) (18Coghlan V.M. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18606-18612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently the tertiary structure of a truncated form of bovine Adx where 3 residues from the N terminus and 20 residues from the C terminus were removed by genetic engineering has been determined (22Müller A. Müller J.J. Muller Y.A. Uhlmann H. Bernhardt R. Heinemann U. Structure. 1998; 6: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This truncated form exhibits 3.2- and 6-fold decreasedK m values for P450scc and P45011β, respectively, compared with that of the wild type, and 4.5-fold enhanced efficiency of substrate conversion catalyzed by P45011β (23Uhlmann H. Kraft R. Bernhardt R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22557-22564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently we determined the tertiary structure of full-length bovine Adx. 5I. Pikuleva, manuscript in preparation. Residues Asp-72, Glu-73, Asp-76, and Asp-79 are located on the surface of the molecule in both structures with their side chains directed toward the solvent. The carbon atoms of the carboxylate groups of these 4 residues form the corners of a quadrilateral with length of the sides between 6.6 and 9.1 Å. Thus, 4 acidic residues in adrenodoxin are potentially available for the pairwise electrostatic interactions with mitochondrial P450s. Determination of which of the residues are paired in electrostatic interactions with P450c27 and P450scc by analysis of the interactions of mutant forms of both partners could establish whether differences in paired interactions exist between mitochondrial P450s which contribute to both binding and catalytic activity. Cytochromes P450 (P450)1are a large superfamily of hemoproteins found in bacteria, yeast, fungi, nematodes, plants, insects, fish, and mammals (1Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J.

These monooxygenases metabolize different endogenous and exogenous substrates including steroids, fatty acids, drugs, and xenobiotics. Eukaryotic P450s are membrane-bound enzymes residing either in the endoplasmic reticulum or the inner mitochondrial membrane. Microsomal P450s accept electrons from NADPH through NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (P450 reductase) while mitochondrial P450s receive electrons from NADPH via a two-protein redox chain consisting of ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin. Whereas different forms of P450s are necessary to metabolize different substrates, a single form of P450 reductase for microsomal P450s and ferredoxin for mitochondrial P450s function as P450 redox partners. Mammalian mitochondrial P450s are involved in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, the production of bile acids, and the formation of active and inactive vitamin D3 metabolites. Among mitochondrial P450 systems that involved the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone (P450scc) in bovine adrenal cortex and other steroidogenic tissues have been most extensively characterized because of its relative abundance.

Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22877-22882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of these residues for Adx binding was implicated initially by chemical modification studies (5Tuls J. Geren L. Millet F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16421-16425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tsubaki M. Iwamoto Y. Hiwatashi A. Ichikawa Y. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6899-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The fact that the key basic residues identified in P450scc are conserved (as lysine or arginine) among all mitochondrial but not in microsomal P450s (Fig.1) suggests that a similar ferredoxin-binding domain is present in all mitochondrial P450s. Recently, we have overexpressed P450c27 (CYP27A1), another mitochondrial P450, in E. coli (7Pikuleva I.A. Björkhem I. Waterman M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This ubiquitous enzyme participates in bile acid biosynthetic pathways catalyzing multiple oxidation reactions at the C-27 atom of steroids in the classical (hepatic) pathway (8Björkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 455-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cholesterol in the alternative (peripheral) pathway (9Anderson K.E. Kok E. Javitt N.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1972; 51: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The present study was initiated by the observation that the two mitochondrial P450s, P450scc and P450c27, show significantly different elution times from Adx-Sepharose, an affinity resin used for purification of both. Quantitation of the binding affinities using a spectral binding assay revealed an almost 30-fold difference in apparent K s values between these two P450s for ferredoxin, with P450c27 binding more tightly. Utilizing site-directed mutagenesis we have established the primary basis of this difference. Three positively charged residues of P450c27 (Lys-354, Lys-358, and Arg-418) play essential roles in binding Adx. Two of them (Lys-354 and Lys-358) are aligned with residues previously identified as the 2 residues essential for ferredoxin binding to P450scc (4Wada A. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22877-22882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while Arg-418 is a newly identified residue important for the interaction of mitochondrial P450c27 with Adx. This residue aligns with Ser-402 in P450scc. The much tighter binding of P450c27 to Adx due to the presence of the additional positively charged residue may be important because of the low levels of ubiquitously expressed P450c27 and Adx relative to much higher levels of P450scc and Adx in steroidogenic mitochondria. DISCUSSIONDetails of the interactions of different mitochondrial P450s with their common redox partner ferredoxin are derived from chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis studies using bovine P450scc. Finding that the key basic residues for interaction with Adx in P450scc are conserved among all mitochondrial P450s suggests that this interaction involves a similar conserved binding domain. In the present study it is confirmed with a second mitochondrial P450, human P450c27, that these conserved lysine residues are important for Adx binding. However, it is also shown that an additional positively charged residue (Arg-418) participates in Adx binding, leading to tighter binding of Adx to P450c27 than to P450scc. This residue is located outside the immediate environment of the conserved lysine residues.Binding of Adx to P450c27 exhibits several differences compared with that to P450scc. First, it is 30-fold tighter. Despite this, the contribution of each of the conserved lysines (Lys-354 and Lys-358) is approximately an order of magnitude weaker than in P450scc. For example, in P450scc mutation of K338A resulted in about a 250-fold increase in apparent K s value, while the replacement of the corresponding lysine residue in P450c27 (K354A) led to only about a 20-fold change of K s. A smaller 150-fold increase in K s was observed upon the mutation of the second conserved lysine in P450scc (K342Q) with ∼20-fold increase inK s arising from mutation of the corresponding K358A in P450c27. The finding that P450c27 binds more tightly to Adx than P450scc and that the conserved lysine residues in P450c27 play a smaller role in Adx binding than in P450scc suggests that additional residue(s) in P450c27 participate in the interaction with Adx. At first we checked the effect of differences in the primary sequence between the two P450s in the 15-amino acid stretch containing the conserved lysine residues important for Adx binding. Between bovine P450scc and human P450c27 there are three differences in this stretch (Val-356, Leu-357, and Tyr-364) and replacement of Val-356 and Leu-357 in P450c27 with the corresponding residue in P450scc (Fig. 1) showed no significant effect on Adx binding. Neither the Y364H nor V356S/L357I/Y364H mutants were detected using immunoblotting analysis during expression in E. coli. Apparently Tyr-364 in P450c27 is important for maintaining structural integrity of the protein, and P450c27 cannot be properly folded when this residue is replaced with histidine, the residue present in P450scc. Mutation of V356S and L357I actually slightly improved binding of Adx to P450c27 indicating that these 2 residues do not contribute to tighter complex formation between Adx and P450c27. Despite the fact that affinity to Adx was increased, the V356S and L357I mutants showed moderately decreased enzymatic activity implying that these mutations directly or indirectly affect some other steps in the P450 catalytic cycle. Because Val-356 and Leu-357 are located within the Adx-binding site, their mutation could affect the rate of electron transfer and hence the turnover number. Thus, while the conserved lysine residues are important for Adx binding to P450c27, additional residues essential for this are located outside this region.To identify these additional residues we utilized the results of a comparative analysis of crystal structures of three bacterial P450s (19Hasemann C.A. Kurumbail R.G. Boddupalli S.S. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1995; 3: 41-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). This analysis argues that the general structure of eukaryotic P450s resembles that of the bacterial enzymes, and most relevant to this study identifies the ERR triad and the meander region as typical features of P450 structure (19Hasemann C.A. Kurumbail R.G. Boddupalli S.S. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1995; 3: 41-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The meander region was proposed to be a likely site of redox-partner interactions (19Hasemann C.A. Kurumbail R.G. Boddupalli S.S. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1995; 3: 41-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Mutation of the positively charged Arg-418, predicted to be located in the P450c27 meander region and conserved in the CYP27A1 family decreased the affinity of P450c27 to Adx ∼20-fold, a comparable effect to that caused by the mutation of conserved Lys-354 and Lys-358. This mutant was expressed at the same level as the wild-type enzyme, did not exhibit any abnormalities during purification, showed a peak at 448 nm without any trace of a peak at 420 nm in the reduced CO-difference spectrum and was able to support the activity in the reconstituted system, although full activity was not achieved because of the lower affinity to Adx. This mutation did not cause any major structural perturbations in the protein and the substantial decrease of affinity for Adx is most likely the result of the neutralization of a positive charge at position 418. The 1.7 kcal/mol increase in apparent free energy of binding caused by this mutation is not significantly different from the value of 1.97 kcal/mol, characterizing Δ(ΔG) between P450scc-Adx and P450c27-Adx. Such close correspondence of these two values implies that Arg-418 is the most important among the residue(s) in P450c27 which confer(s) the additional strength for Adx binding. Mutation of His-414 which is also located in the meander region, only 3 residues away from Arg-418, to Thr the corresponding residue in P450scc, did not decrease but slightly improved binding to Adx, indicating that His-414 is not the additional residue in P450c27 important for the interaction with Adx.The present studies raise new questions regarding the interaction of mitochondrial P450s with the common ferredoxin redox partner. The most important one is: what is the physiological significance of greatly different affinities of mitochondrial P450s for ferredoxin? Besides the present work demonstrating that two mitochondrial P450s have significantly different Adx-binding properties, there are several studies showing that mitochondrial P45011β (CYP11B1) has lower affinity for Adx than P450scc (11Cupp J.R. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1602-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yamazaki T. McNamara B.C. Jefcoate C.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 95: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Becker V. Bernhardt R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4883-4888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, differences in binding affinity for ferredoxin may be a general phenomenon among mammalian mitochondrial P450s. Perhaps the different levels of expression of ferredoxin in different tissues and the tissue distribution pattern of mitochondrial P450s provide an explanation. The lower the level of expression of ferredoxin and P450 in a given tissue (liver or kidney, for example) the higher the affinity between two proteins and vice versa. In tissues where several mitochondrial P450s are present simultaneously at relatively high levels (P450scc and P45011β in adrenal cortex), different affinities may serve to regulate the preferential partitioning of electron transfer toward one P450. If the level of expression of two P450s is significantly different, higher binding affinity of the more poorly expressed P450 is a way to compete efficiently for ferredoxin.Another unanswered question is how many binding sites for Adx are in mitochondrial P450s, and if there are several sites, are they formed by the same stretch of primary sequence in different mitochondrial P450s? In the absence of the tertiary structure of P450c27 we do not know if Lys-354, Lys-358, and Arg-418 are part of one site. If the overall tertiary structure of P450c27 is not too different from that of bacterial P450s, P450cam, P450terp, and P450BM-3, then these 3 residues should be spatially close to each other forming a single binding site. Our data also indicates that there may be other residues in P450c27 interacting with Adx which form a separate binding site, which contributes much less to Adx binding than Lys-354, Lys-358, or Arg-418. Thus, in mitochondrial P450s with high affinity for Adx there may be two sites for interaction with Adx, one being common and the other one being specific for each P450.Site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that four conserved negatively charged residues (Asp-72, Glu-73, Asp-76, and Asp-79) located within the highly acidic region (positions 68–86) in mitochondrial ferredoxins are important for binding of human ferredoxin to bovine P450scc (18Coghlan V.M. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18606-18612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contribution of these residues to the affinity for P450scc is different being the greatest for Asp-76 and Asp-79 (K s for D76N and D79A mutants was increased ∼6- and 8-fold, respectively) followed by Asp-72 and Glu-73 (3- and 4-fold increase of K s for D72N and E73Q mutants) (18Coghlan V.M. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18606-18612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently the tertiary structure of a truncated form of bovine Adx where 3 residues from the N terminus and 20 residues from the C terminus were removed by genetic engineering has been determined (22Müller A. Müller J.J. Muller Y.A. Uhlmann H. Bernhardt R. Heinemann U. Structure. 1998; 6: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This truncated form exhibits 3.2- and 6-fold decreasedK m values for P450scc and P45011β, respectively, compared with that of the wild type, and 4.5-fold enhanced efficiency of substrate conversion catalyzed by P45011β (23Uhlmann H. Kraft R. Bernhardt R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22557-22564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently we determined the tertiary structure of full-length bovine Adx. 5I. Pikuleva, manuscript in preparation. Residues Asp-72, Glu-73, Asp-76, and Asp-79 are located on the surface of the molecule in both structures with their side chains directed toward the solvent. The carbon atoms of the carboxylate groups of these 4 residues form the corners of a quadrilateral with length of the sides between 6.6 and 9.1 Å. Thus, 4 acidic residues in adrenodoxin are potentially available for the pairwise electrostatic interactions with mitochondrial P450s. Determination of which of the residues are paired in electrostatic interactions with P450c27 and P450scc by analysis of the interactions of mutant forms of both partners could establish whether differences in paired interactions exist between mitochondrial P450s which contribute to both binding and catalytic activity. Details of the interactions of different mitochondrial P450s with their common redox partner ferredoxin are derived from chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis studies using bovine P450scc.

Promoter recognition requires sequence-specific contacts by the transcriptional apparatus. At most promoters these contacts are made upstream from the transcription start point. Once the transcriptional apparatus has bound the promoter to form a closed complex, an isomerization event occurs to generate the open complex, forming the single-stranded template required for transcription. The bacteriumEscherichia coli provides a good model for understanding protein-DNA interactions during transcription initiation. E. coli uses a single core RNA polymerase for transcription elongation with subunit composition α2ββ′. Promoter specificity is principally afforded by a separate subunit, ς, which associates with the core enzyme to give holoenzyme (RNAP)1 but dissociates once sequence-specific promoter DNA contacts are no longer required (1Gross C.A. Chan C.L. Lonetto M.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The ς70 subunit, encoded by rpoD, is one of several ς subunits utilized by E. coli and is responsible for directing the transcription of most genes during vegetative growth. RNAP is capable of sequence-specific transcription initiation in the absence of other transcription factors. Factor-independent transcription is reliant on the ability of ς70 to make stable contacts with the promoter DNA (1Gross C.A. Chan C.L. Lonetto M.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol.

J. 1993; 289: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore this TGX motif is able to compensate for a poor −35 hexamer. The TG motif has been shown to be important for promoter activity in several other bacterial species (8Helmann J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2351-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 9Bashyam M.D. Tyagi A.K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2568-2573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sabelnikov A.G.

Work from many laboratories has defined the regions within RNA polymerase that are responsible for sequence-specific contacts within promoter DNA. Regions 2.4 and 4.2 of ς70 contact the −10 and −35 hexamers, respectively (1Gross C.A. Chan C.L. Lonetto M.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 2Gross C.A. Lonetto M. Losick R. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 129-176Google Scholar), whereas the C-terminal domain of the α subunit (αCTD) contacts the UP element (4Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Recent work from this laboratory has indicated that a newly defined region of ς70, region 2.5, is responsible for making sequence-specific contacts with the extended −10 motif (12Barne K.A. Bown J.A. Busby S.J.W. Minchin S.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4034-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This region was identified by screening for altered or relaxed specificity mutants of ς70 capable of compensating for down-mutations within the extended −10 motif. One relaxed specificity mutant, ς70 E458G, was isolated (12Barne K.A. Bown J.A. Busby S.J.W. Minchin S.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4034-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The E458G substitution partially suppressed the effect of changing the G·C base pair of the TG motif, suggesting a role for the side chain at position 458 in contacting the extended −10 motif. The aim of the study presented in this paper is to complement the genetic study with biophysical data to support the suggested role of region 2.5. We wanted to show that, in open, transcriptionally competent complexes at E. coli promoters, region 2.5 of ς70 is located near to promoter DNA, just upstream of the −10 hexamer. To do this, we exploited a novel method that relies on tethering a DNA cleavage agent to a single specific amino acid side chain of a protein (13Heilek G.M. Marusak R. Meares C.F. Noller H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1113-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The reagentp-bromoacetamidobenzyl-EDTA·Fe (FeBABE) has one reactive group facilitating covalent attachment to cysteine side chains, whereas a second group holds a single metal atom in a tight coordination complex (14Sundberg M.W. Meares C.F. Goodwin D.A. Diamanti C.I. Nature. 1974; 250: 587-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Under appropriate conditions, the divalent cation can participate in the generation of hydroxyl radicals, which attack deoxyribose units, resulting in DNA strand scission (15Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5469-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Recently, this chemistry has been applied to the study of the interaction of αCTD of E. coli RNAP with promoter DNA. Hydroxyl radical DNA cleavage mediated by FeBABE showed that the two αCTD subunits are arranged asymmetrically, contacting different halves of the UP element and that activator contact patches are available on both subunits (16Murakami K. Kimura M. Owens J.T. Meares C.F. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,17Murakami K. Owens J.T. Belyaeva T.A. Meares C.F. Busby S.J.W. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11274-11278Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To identify sites on promoter DNA that are near to region 2.5 of ς70 in open complexes, amino acids in this region were replaced with cysteine for conjugation with the DNA cleavage agent FeBABE. E.coli strain DH5α (supE44ΔlacU169(φ80 lacZΔM15)hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96thi-1 relA1) was used for all cloning (18Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8213) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, chemicals were purchased from Sigma, radiochemicals were from NEN Life Science Products, synthetic oligonucleotides were from Alta Bioscience at the University of Birmingham, restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs and Taq DNA polymerase from Boehringer Mannheim. Mutants ofrpoD encoding a single cysteine were generated by megaprimer polymerase chain reaction (19Perrin S. Gilliland G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7433-7438Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) using plasmid pGEMD(S), which contains a cysteine-free rpoD gene as a template (20Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1015-1022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 21Owens J.T. Miyake R. Murakami K. Chmura A.J. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6021-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mutagenic oligonucleotides complementary to the template strand ofrpoD used were CYS454 (5′-CCATCCGTATTCCGTGTCACATGATTGAGACCATC-3′), CYS459 (5′-GTGCATATGATTGAGTGTATCAACAAGCTCAAC-3′), and CYS461 (5′-TGATTGAGACCATCTGTAAGCTCAACCGTATT-3′), encoding mutations corresponding to cysteine substitutions at positions 454, 459, and 461 of ς70. In the first round of polymerase chain reaction, a mutagenic oligonucleotide and oligonucleotide D13346(5′-GGTCGCAGAATCCAGCGGC-3′), annealing to the coding strand ofrpoD were used to amplify a “megaprimer” fragment ofrpoD. In the second round of polymerase chain reaction, the megaprimer and oligonucleotide D12444 (5′-GCAGATTAATGATATCAACCGTCGT-3′) annealing to the template strand of rpoD were used to amplify a 540-base pair fragment of rpoD. Plasmid cloning vector Pinpoint-Xa1 (Promega) was used for direct cloning of polymerase chain reaction products according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the recombinants were used for sequencing. A cysteine substitution at position 458 had previously been constructed (22.Barne, K. A., Isolation and Characterisation of an Altered Specificity Mutant of the Escherichia coli RNA Polymerase p70 Subunit. Ph.D thesis, 1997, The University of Birmingham, UK.Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes XhoI and BamHI were used to subclone internal fragments of rpoD containing the desired mutations into pGEMD(S) (21Owens J.T. Miyake R. Murakami K. Chmura A.J. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6021-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Construction of the other single cysteine mutants used (422C and 581C) are described elsewhere (21Owens J.T. Miyake R. Murakami K. Chmura A.J. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6021-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The KAB-TTcon (23Bingham A.H.A. Ponnambalam S. Chan B. Busby S. Gene. 1986; 41: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and KAB-TG (24Chan B. Busby S. Gene. 1989; 84: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) promoters were cloned on EcoRI-HindIII fragments in the galK fusion vector pAA121. The promotergalP1(19T8A9A) (25Burns H.D. Belyaeva T.A. Busby S.J.W. Minchin S.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was cloned as anEcoRI-HindIII fragment in pBR322. The sequence of the three promoters is shown in Fig. 1. For FeBABE cleavage reactions and transcription run-off assays, 850-base pair PstI-HindIII fragments were prepared from plasmid DNA purified on caesium chloride gradients. In addition to the promoter under study, these fragments also contained two additional promoters, pX and pbla. For the FeBABE cleavage analysis, the template strand was labeled at theHindIII end with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase or the nontemplate strand was labeled at theHindIII end using [α-32P]dATP and theE. coli DNA polymerase Klenow fragment. Single cysteine mutants of ς70 were purified by the method described previously for the wild-type protein (20Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1015-1022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 26Fujita N. Ishihama A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 121-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the important modification of the exclusion of thiol-containing reducing agents (dithiothreitol or β-mercaptoethanol) from all steps in purification. Purified mutant subunits were dialyzed against storage buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, at 4 °C, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, and 50% glycerol) and stored at −20 °C. FeBABE was synthesized and characterized as described previously (27Greiner D.P. Miyake R. Moran J.K. Jones A.D. Negishi T. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Bioconjugate Chem. 1997; 8: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Single cysteine derivatives of ς70 were used for conjugation with FeBABE based on the method of Murakami et al. (16Murakami K. Kimura M. Owens J.T. Meares C.F. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Conjugation was initiated by mixing 1.2 ml of 6.67 μmprotein solution in conjugation buffer (10 mm Hepes, 200 mm KCl, and 2 mm EDTA, pH of 8.0) with 9 μl of 18 mm FeBABE in Me2SO. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, excess unreacted FeBABE was removed by dialysis against storage buffer. The efficiency of conjugation was determined by estimating free side chains of both conjugated and un-conjugated proteins with the fluorescent reagent CPM (7-diethylamino-3-(4′maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin) (Molecular Probes) (27Greiner D.P. Miyake R. Moran J.K. Jones A.D. Negishi T. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Bioconjugate Chem. 1997; 8: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A 10-fold molar excess of ς70 was mixed with core RNAP and incubated at 20 °C for 30 min (26Fujita N. Ishihama A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 121-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNAP holoenzyme (300 nm) was mixed with 32P-end-labeled promoter fragment (0.4 nm) in a reaction volume of 35 μl (20 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mmpotassium glutamate, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 μg/ml poly(dI·dC)) and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Complexes were challenged with heparin (200 μm at 37 °C for 5 min). DNA cleavage was initiated by the addition of sodium ascorbate (2 mm) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 20 min. Modified DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol before analysis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 6 murea. Gels were calibrated with Maxam-Gilbert G+A sequence ladders and were processed and scanned using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The activity of RNAP reconstituted with wild-type, un-conjugated, and conjugated ς70derivatives was measured by in vitro transcription assays (28Busby S. Kolb A. Minchin S.D. Neale G.G. Protein-DNA Interactions: Principles and Protocols. 30. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1994: 397-411Google Scholar). Fragments used for cleavage analysis were also used as templates for in vitro transcription. The derivatives of thegal promoter were expected to generate run-off products of 51 nucleotides. DNA template (5 nm) and RNAP holoenzyme (100 nm) were preincubated in 12 μl of transcription buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5% glycerol) for 5 min at 37 °C. Transcription was initiated by the addition of unlabeled nucleotide triphosphates ATP, CTP, GTP (200 μm), and UTP (10 μm), 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), 100 μg/ml heparin. Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of run-off stop mix (20 mm EDTA, 80% deionized formamide, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol). Transcripts were analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 6 m urea and scanned using a PhosphorImager. Modeling of region 2.5 interactions with promoter DNA is based on secondary structure prediction and genetic evidence. Secondary structure prediction suggests that Glu-458 is part of a α-helix starting at Val-454. An octapeptide from Val-454 to Asn-461 was constructed using the molecular modeling package Quanta by Molecular Simulations, Inc. and energy minimized to place amino acid side chains in sterically favorable positions. This peptide was then manually docked into the major groove of a model of B-form DNA based on the sequence of KAB-TG from position +1 to −29 with the carboxyl group of Glu-458 making base-pair edge hydrogen bond interactions with N6 of adenine at position −15 and N4 of cytosine at position −14 (i.e. the template strand of the TG motif). In this position, no steric clashes were observed. The model was extended to include the helix of region 2.4 (helix 14) derived from the crystal structure of a tryptic fragment of ς70 (29Malhotra A. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The atomic coordinates for the fragment (1SIG) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, Long Island 2http://www.pdb.bnl.gov. ). Genetic studies show that Gln-437 and Thr-440 are involved in interactions with position −12 (30Siegele D. Hu J. Walter W. Gross C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 31Waldburger C. Gardella T. Wong R. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The coordinates obtained were used to dock helix 14 with residues 437 and 440 in hydrogen-bonding contact with the base pair edge at −12 (see Fig. 7). The minor groove at the center on the −10 element must be placed on the inside of a curvature for efficient promoter recognition by E. coli RNAP (32deHaseth P.L. Helmann J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, many studies show that recognition of −10 and −35 elements is accompanied by promoter bending and suggest that the major groove of the −10 hexamer widens to accommodate ς (33Pérez-Martı́n J. Rojo F. de Lorenzo V. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 268-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such a promoter structure would allow favorable interactions between basic residues Arg-441 and Arg-446 and the phosphate backbone (T-A base steps of the −10 promoter consensus element distort double-strand DNA in solution) (34Spassky A. Rimsky S. Buc H. Busby S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1871-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The model in Fig. 7 a places the carboxyl group of amino acid 448 1.0 nm from the amino group of residue 454. This would allow for a flexible unstructured 7-amino acid loop connecting the two helices shown. Methods of probing for single-stranded DNA assign position −12 as the upstream limit of the open complex (35Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8074-8081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Buckle M. Buc H. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 207-225Google Scholar). The TG motif at position −14/15 would thus remain in a region of double-stranded DNA, whereas helix 14 is shown within the transcription bubble (Fig. 7 b). In previous work, we used suppression genetics to identify a region of the ς70 subunit of RNA polymerase, region 2.5, that interacts with the extended −10 motif of bacterial promoters (12Barne K.A. Bown J.A. Busby S.J.W. Minchin S.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4034-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In this work, we have exploited a tethered DNA-cleaving agent to show that region 2.5 of ς70 is in close proximity to the extended −10 motif. The reagent used was FeBABE, which is covalently attached to ς70 by conjugation with a cysteine residue. Starting with an rpoD gene that had been mutated to remove all three native cysteine codons, single cysteine codons were introduced at amino acid positions 422, 454, 458, 459, 461, and 581. Residue 422 lies within region 2.3, adjacent to region 2.4, which is known to contact the −10 hexamer. Residues 454, 458, 459, and 461 are within region 2.5, postulated to contact the extended −10 motif, and residue 581 lies in region 4.2, which is known to contact the −35 hexamer element. The FeBABE reagent was conjugated to the single cysteine proteins, and the efficiency of conjugation was determined. The FeBABE conjugation yields were: 422C, 46%; 454C, 82%; 458C, 59%, 459C, 60%; 461C, 56%; 581C, 71%. In this study we analyzed the interaction of E. coli RNA polymerase-carrying FeBABE with different promoters. We chose promoters that were sufficiently strong such that, in our conditions, open complex formation would not be disrupted by the introduction of the bulky FeBABE probe into region 2.5 of ς70. Thus, Figs.2 and 3show the transcription activity of RNAP holoenzyme preparations containing single-cysteine derivatives of ς70 before and after conjugation with FeBABE. With the exception of 422C, all derivatives retained at least 80% activity compared with wild-type before conjugation and at least 70% activity after conjugation with FeBABE.Figure 3Quantification of the transcription activity of RNAP carrying ς70 derivatives. The activity of the ς70 derivatives relative to wild-type ς70 (100%) at KAB-TTcon (a) and KAB-TG (b). The black bars represent activity of derivatives before conjugation, and the gray bars show activity after FeBABE conjugation and correction for the presence of unconjugated ς70.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In our first experiment, we examined the cleavage of a labeled PstI-HindIII fragment purified from pAA121 carrying the KAB-TG promoter (Fig. 1), using RNAP containing ς70 tagged with FeBABE positioned at 461. This DNA fragment contains the KAB-TG promoter as well as the pbla and pX (these promoters are located upstream from the EcoRI site in the pAA121 vector). The results in Fig. 4 show that cleavage is observed with holoenzyme reconstituted from FeBABE-conjugated 461C mutant ς. In contrast, no cleavage was observed with holoenzyme containing either wild-type ς70 or unconjugated 461C. The results (Fig. 4,lane 4) clearly show that cleavage is restricted to the three promoters. Further analysis revealed that similar patterns of FeBABE-mediated cleavage are observed at the KAB-TG, pbla, and pX promoters (data not shown). In our second set of experiments, both strands of the consensus extended −10 promoter galP1(19T8A9A) and the semi-synthetic promoters KAB-TG and KAB-TTcon (Fig. 1) were analyzed for cleavage by holoenzymes carrying ς70 protein tagged with FeBABE at different positions. The first promoter, galP1(19T8A9A), is a derivative of galP1, which has been changed to introduce a consensus −10 element. It is an extended −10 promoter containing a UP element but has a −35 hexamer with no homology with the consensus (25Burns H.D. Belyaeva T.A. Busby S.J.W. Minchin S.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of a −10 extension on the pattern of cleavage, we also compared the KAB-TG and KAB-TTcon promoters. These promoters, which are also derived from the galP1 sequence, have similar activities. KAB-TG carries an extended −10 motif and canonical −10 (4/6 fit to consensus) and −35 (5/6 fit to consensus) hexamer sequences. KAB-TTcon lacks the extended −10 motif but carries an improved −35 (6/6 fit to consensus) hexamer. Fig.5 a shows the patterns of cleavage on the nontemplate strand of the galP1(19T8A9A), KAB-TG, and KAB-TTcon promoters in open complexes with RNAP holoenzymes carrying ς70 tagged with FeBABE at positions 581, 422, 454, 458, 459, and 461. For each holoenzyme, the pattern of cleavage is similar at all three promoters, with some small variations in the positions and intensities of cleavage. For example, some upstream cleavages at the galP1 (19T8A9A) promoter are reduced. This is consistent with this promoter's lack of homology to the consensus within the −35 hexamer, leading to weaker interactions with upstream sequences. However, the overall similarity in cleavage patterns suggests that the organization of the different parts of ς70 is the same, irrespective of the precise promoter sequence. In contrast, changes in the position of FeBABE in ς70 result in marked variations in the positions of cleavage. Cleavage by FeBABE tethered at positions 581 (region 4.2) and 422 (region 2.3) of ς70 have been studied previously in open complexes at the lacUV5 promoter (37Owens J.T. Chmura A.J. Murakami K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7670-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The data here are in agreement with those previously published. FeBABE attached to 581C cleaved promoter DNA at positions −44/−45, −34 to −37, and −24 to −26. FeBABE positioned on 422C cleaved promoter DNA with very low efficiency at position −13/−12. The FeBABE positioned within region 2.5 (at residues 454, 458, 459, and 461) resulted in cleavage around −20 for all the ς70 derivatives, with additional cleavages at other positions being dependent on which ς70derivative was studied. The predominant position of cleavage resulting from FeBABE tethered at 458 is ∼−20 for all three promoters; however, additional upstream cleavage around −36 is seen for complexes at the KAB-TG promoter. Cleavage by FeBABE attached to 459C is limited to DNA around position −20. FeBABE located at 454 cleaves the nontemplate strand at position −20 but also at −17/−16. Cleavage at −17/−16 is not observed for other ς70 derivatives. FeBABE positioned at 461 again cleaves at −20, but additionally, there is cleavage from −13 to −1. Fig. 5 b shows cleavage on the template strand of the different promoters by FeBABE, located at different positions in ς70. Differences in the positions and intensities of DNA cleavage were observed compared with the nontemplate strand. A single region of promoter DNA at positions −13 and −14 is sensitive to hydroxyl radical attack by FeBABE when attached to all four positions in region 2.5. In addition FeBABE tethered at 458 and 459 cleaves at positions −21/−22, and 458C generates more distal cleavage at −38 to −40. FeBABE at 454C also gives unique cleavage at −18/−19 and, in common with 461C, cleaves downstream at −7/−8. There is increased cleavage at −7/−8 by FeBABE positioned at 461. Faint upstream cleavage for FeBABE attached at 461 was seen at −21/22 (common to 458C and 459C). Promoter-specific differences were seen in the cleavage pattern from FeBABE at 454, with an increase in the intensity of bands at −8 corresponding to an alteration of promoter bias toward the −10 element. As previously observed, FeBABE positioned at 581 in conserved region 4.2 cleaves promoter DNA from −38 to −41 and at −28/−29, whereas 422C in conserved region 2.3 gives weak cleavage at −16/−17. Fig.6 shows the cleavage pattern from both strands of promoter KAB-TG in schematic form. This study and previous work (37Owens J.T. Chmura A.J. Murakami K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7670-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) has shown that the cysteine residues present in the wild-type ς70 subunit of RNA polymerase are not essential for transcription initiation. Thus, it is possible to introduce cysteine residues in ς70 and to attach the DNA cleavage agent FeBABE and still retain transcriptional competence. In this work, FeBABE attached to the ς70subunit of RNA polymerase was used to probe open complexes at a set of related promoters. The first important point to note is that the overall structure of RNA polymerase bound at promoters carrying different sequence elements appears to be very similar; the cleavage data was similar for all three variants of the galP1 promoter (Fig. 1) as well as the pX and pblapromoters. FeBABE attached to positions 422 in region 2.3 and 581 in region 4.2 were used as controls in our experiments, and the data are similar to those observed in a previous study (37Owens J.T. Chmura A.J. Murakami K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7670-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the view that RNA polymerase uses a variety of protein-DNA interactions to form essentially the same open complex at different classes of promoters. Note that the principal information gained from this technique concerns location, and the relative intensities of different bands cannot be interpreted to give detailed information about binding mechanisms. For this reason, we chose to work with strong promoters, where open complex formation would not be hindered by the bulky substitution of FeBABE. The major conclusion from this study is that, in open complexes, region 2.5 of ς70 is close to promoter DNA sequences just upstream of the −10 hexamer. One aim of this work was to propose a model for the interaction of region 2.5 of ς70 with promoter DNA. Interpretation of the data is complicated by the fact that the holoenzymes carrying FeBABE-modified ς70proteins are interacting with DNA that is known to be both bent and unwound. However, Fig. 7 shows possible models of how regions 2.4 and 2.5 of ς70 may interact with promoter DNA, based on the data obtained from this study and previous genetic work as discussed below. The similarity of cleavage pattern observed for FeBABE tethered at 454 and 461 and for FeBABE tethered at 458 and 459 is consistent with region 2.5 being α-helical. The cleavage pattern seen for FeBABE at 459 indicates that the reagent contacts the double-stranded promoter DNA around position −20. In the model, consistent with the length of the FeBABE spacer arm, the β carbon of Thr-459 is approximately 1.2 nm away from the proposed position of radical release. The FeBABE attached to 459C may be constrained, allowing it to sit in only one position relative to the DNA. We propose that position 459 is buried by the helix of region 2.5. FeBABE positioned at 458 results in the same cleavage pattern seen for 459C, but with additional weaker upstream DNA cleavage around the −35 hexamer, which may be because of bending and wrapping of upstream DNA sequences (33Pérez-Martı́n J. Rojo F. de Lorenzo V. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 268-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cleavage patterns observed with FeBABE positioned at 454 and 461 are more complex. We suggest that this complexity arises from the location of these side chains in an exposed position in the region 2.5 helix and the fact that promoter DNA is melted downstream from position −12 (12Barne K.A. Bown J.A. Busby S.J.W. Minchin S.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4034-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 38Chan B. Minchin S. Busby S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The model presented in Fig. 7 b shows a conformation for open complex promoter DNA consistent with the cleavages observed from FeBABE at positions 454, 458, and 459, and 461. The modeling of region 2.5 as an α-helix is consistent with the data where FeBABE at positions 458 and 459 (100° apart on the α-helix) only cleave promoter DNA upstream on the TG motif, and FeBABE cleavages from positions 454 and 461 span the TG motif. The FeBABE cleavage upstream of the TG is best modeled with double-stranded DNA. In contrast, the complex pattern downstream of the TG motif cannot be modeled on double-stranded DNA, because the DNA was probed in the open complex. Modeling of region 2.5 as an α-helix in contact with the TG motif has important consequences for the orientation of ς70 and, in particular, region 2.4. Thus, in addition to the results presented here, we used previous genetic data to orientate both regions 2.4 and 2.5 with respect to the promoter (12Barne K.A. Bown J.A. Busby S.J.W. Minchin S.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4034-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 30Siegele D. Hu J. Walter W. Gross C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 31Waldburger C. Gardella T. Wong R. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The aromatic residues Tyr-430 and Trp-433 are implicated in DNA melting and believed to interact at the −10/−11 positions on promoter DNA. The Gln-437 and Thr-440 residues interact with the base pair at −12. The Glu-458 residue is involved in the binding of the extended −10 motif at −14/−15 by region 2.5 of ς70. Hence the structures shown in Fig. 7, aand b, represent proposed orientations of regions 2.4 (helix 14) and 2.5 that can account for both the genetic and the biophysical data. Note that the orientation of helix 14 proposed in Fig. 7 is different to that suggested by Owens et al. (37Owens J.T. Chmura A.J. Murakami K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7670-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) on the basis of cleavage patterns generated by FeBABE, located at positions 132, 376, 396, and 422 in ς70. Our present data is insufficient to prove either proposal (because of flexibility both in the DNA and in ς70 just downstream of helix 14). For example, increased DNA distortion could fit the data presented by Owenset al. to the models shown in Fig. 7. Similarly our data could be fitted to the Owens et al. model if a sharp kink is introduced into ς70 between helix 14 and region 2.5. According to the model presented here (Fig. 7 b), the seven amino acids immediately downstream of helix 14 form a junction between separate domains of ς70 (39Severinova E. Severinov K. Fenyö D. Marr M. Brody E.N. Roberts J.W. Chait B.T. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Flexibility of the loop would allow movement of region 2.4 relative to 2.5 during open complex formation. In the closed complex, this loop constrains the helix of region 2.4 relative to promoter DNA in the orientation shown (Fig.7 b). This model shows how region 2.5 can serve as an anchor, providing a scaffold on which the open complex may be built. These observations support the idea that the TG motif sets a limit on the conformational fluctuation of the −10 region (34Spassky A. Rimsky S. Buc H. Busby S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1871-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 40Chen Y.F. Helmann J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 41Juang Y.L. Helmann J.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8465-8473Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This is consistent with analysis of the temperature dependence of promoter opening at galP1 and supports a mechanism of open complex formation whereby melting nucleates around −10 (42Burns H. Minchin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3840-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 43Grimes E. Busby S. Minchin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6113-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Such a feature would be of particular importance at extended −10 promoters that lack an identifiable −35 hexamer.

However, the kinetics of receptor delivery to the basolateral cell surface were slowed by the mutation. Although surface delivery of the wild-type receptor was inhibited by brefeldin A, the delivery of the mutant receptor was insensitive to the drug.

Polarized epithelial cells possess two surface domains as follows: the apical plasma membrane that faces the external environment and the basolateral plasma membrane that is in contact with internal milieu. The apical and basolateral plasma membranes have very different protein and lipid compositions. It has been proposed that sorting and targeting events of membrane proteins and lipids largely contribute to the polarized phenotype of the cell (1Rodriguez-Boulan E. Powell S.K. Annu. Rev.

Although in recent years we have learned a great deal about relatively small stretches of amino acids encoding sorting signals that mediate polarized trafficking of membrane proteins (4Aroeti B.

BioEssays. 1995; 17: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), almost nothing is known about the sorting machinery that decodes these signals and confers polarized trafficking to a specific surface domain (1Rodriguez-Boulan E. Powell S.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 327-395Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 2Nelson W.J. Science. 1992; 258: 948-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 6Mostov K. Apodaca G.

Polarized trafficking steps are modulated by signal transduction processes (4Aroeti B. Okhrimenko H. Reich V. Orzech E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 57-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Mostov K.E. Cardone M.H. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 9Weimbs T. Low S.-H. Chapin S.J.

Cell. 1998; 9: 1787-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whose activity is thought to be superimposed on the activity of the sorting machinery, but the mechanisms through which these processes facilitate protein incorporation into a particular pathway are largely unknown. Presently, we know four distinct features shown to determine sorting of apical proteins to the apical domain as follows: first is the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor of membrane proteins (11Brown D.A. Crise B. Rose J.K. Science. 1989; 245: 1499-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 12Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Davitz M.A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2145-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar); the second is the mannose-rich core of N-glycans present in the luminal portion of proteins (13Scheiffele P. Peranen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar); the third isO-glycosylated stalk domain of transmembrane protein (14Yeaman C. Le Gall A.H. Baldwin A.N. Monlauzeur L. Le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar); and the fourth is a proteinaceous signal encoded by either the transmembrane domain or the ectodomain (15Alonso M.A. Fan L. Alarcon B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30748-30752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Many studies agree that basolateral sorting of plasma membrane proteins is mediated by the presence of relatively short but specific cytoplasmic sorting motifs (reviewed in Refs. 4Aroeti B. Okhrimenko H. Reich V. Orzech E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 57-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and 5Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Extensive mutagenesis studies have uncovered two general types of basolateral sorting motifs. First there are basolateral sorting signals for localization to clathrin-coated membranes that rely either on a critical tyrosine residue, such as those found in the low density lipoprotein receptor (low density lipoprotein receptor proximal determinant, (16Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar)), the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (17Thomas D.C. Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3313-3320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or on a di-leucine motif (18Hunziker W. Fumey C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2963-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The second are basolateral sorting signals unrelated to localization to clathrin-coated membranes. These signals can rely either on a Tyr motif, e.g. the distal determinant in the low density lipoprotein receptor, or rely on non-aromatic residues such as found for the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR1 (4Aroeti B. Okhrimenko H. Reich V. Orzech E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 57-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar)). Interestingly, either the same or a closely related basolateral sorting signal can mediate basolateral sorting from the TGN and recycling from endosomes, after endocytosis from the basolateral plasma membrane (20Aroeti B. Mostov K.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2297-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,21Matter K. Whitney J.A. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. Cell. 1993; 74: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We use the pIgR expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells as a model system for studying the mechanisms that regulate polarized trafficking of membrane proteins in epithelial cells. Previous studies have intensively analyzed the intracellular trafficking of the pIgR in MDCK cells. According to the simplest model, the pIgR is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a single spanning type I membrane protein. It is then targeted from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) pIgR molecules are directed to the basolateral surface. However, the exact pathway that newly synthesized membrane proteins take to the basolateral cell surface is currently not understood. Although in the simplest model, basolateral proteins are selectively sorted (packed) into basolateral transport vesicles that are subsequently directly delivered to the basolateral surface, recent studies have provided evidence that targeting to the cell surface may be indirect, i.e.involving passage through an endosomal compartment prior to cell-surface delivery (22Futter C.E. Connolly C.N. Cutler D.F. Hopkins C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10999-11003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 23Leitinger B. Hille-Rehfeld A. Spiess M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10109-10113Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Whether a similar indirect route exists in MDCK cells is currently unknown nor is the mechanism of sorting to these endosomes known. Upon arrival at the basolateral cell surface, polymeric Igs (e.g. dimeric IgA; dIgA) specifically bind to the pIgR. The pIgR·dIgA complexes are endocytosed via clathrin-coated pits, delivered to basolateral endosomes, and then delivered to the opposite pole of the cell via vesicular intermediates in a process termed transcytosis. Transcytotic pIgR·dIgA complexes are not directly routed from basolateral endosomes to the apical surface. Rather, pIgR·Ig complexes are first targeted to, and subsequently accumulate at, a pericentriolar subapical endosomal compartment that is active in recycling of apical and perhaps basolateral membrane-bound ligands (24Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar,25Barroso M. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This compartment has been termed the “apical recycling endosome.” The final step of transcytosis involves pIgR targeting from the apical recycling endosome to the apical surface. There, the pIgR is cleaved by an endogenous protease, and the extracellular ligand-binding domain (i.e. the secretory component, SC) is released together with dIgA to external (mucosal) secretions, such as milk, saliva, bile, tears, and intestinal fluids, where they form the first immunological response against infections. The pIgR is also transcytosed constitutively (i.e. in the absence of the ligand), and this process is regulated by phosphorylation of cytoplasmic Ser-664 (26Casanova J.E. Breitfeld P.P. Ross S.A. Mostov K.E. Science. 1990; 248: 742-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies revealed that the cytoplasmic domain of the pIgR contains several discrete sorting signals that mediate as follows: its targeting from the TGN to the basolateral surface; endocytosis; avoidance of lysosomes; and transcytosis (4Aroeti B. Okhrimenko H. Reich V. Orzech E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 57-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6Mostov K. Apodaca G. Aroeti B. Okamoto C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Basolateral sorting from the TGN is mediated by an autonomous and dominant 17-residue membrane-proximal basolateral sorting signal (27Casanova J.E. Apodaca G. Mostov K.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 65-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), whose activity depends mainly on three amino acids (His-656, Arg-657, and Val-660) contained within the 17-residue signal (19Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Structural studies of oligopeptides corresponding to the 17-residue basolateral sorting signal provided evidence for a β-turn secondary structure, which might constitute a general feature of endocytotic and other sorting signals (7Mostov K.E. Cardone M.H. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Residues involved in basolateral sorting of the pIgR from the TGN also control polarized sorting in endosomes (20Aroeti B. Mostov K.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2297-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), suggesting that common mechanisms regulate polarized trafficking in the TGN and in endosomes. The pIgR thus appears to contain multiple cytoplasmic signals that mediate distinct intracellular transport events; these signals are probably decoded by a cytoplasmic sorting machinery located at specific compartments through which the pIgR passes en route to a target organelle. Coat proteins such as clathrin and clathrin adaptor proteins (AP), AP-1 and AP-2, are thought to be involved in membrane protein sorting into coated membrane domains and promote the budding of transport vesicles from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and from the plasma membrane, respectively (for recent reviews see Refs. 28Lewin D.A. Mellman I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and 29Robinson M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 99-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The AP-1 and AP-2 adaptor complexes are composed of two large subunits (γ and β1 for AP-1 or α and β for AP-2), a medium-sized subunit (μ1 or μ2), and a small subunit (ς1 and ς2). Although in a few cases the interactions between AP-binding and membrane proteins have been resolved (for a recent review see Ref. 30Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), the mechanistic relations between coat binding and membrane protein targeting has not been fully elucidated. One common feature is that many of the coat proteins involved in protein sorting are sensitive to the action of the fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA). This drug is thought to act, in part, by blocking the binding to Golgi membranes of at least four coat proteins as follows: coatomer (e.g. COP-I) involved in ER-Golgi transport and in endocytosis (8Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar, 29Robinson M.S.

Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); the TGN clathrin-coated vesicle-associated protein AP-1 adaptor complex (32Wong D.H. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) involved in sorting of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR) to endosomes; p200, a protein of 200,000 daltons that is now known to be type II myosin (33Narula N. McMorrow I. Plopper G. Doherty J. Matlin K.S. Burke B. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 34Musch A. Cohen D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar); and the recently discovered AP-3 adaptor protein (35Dell' Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 36Simpson F. Peden A.A. Christopoulou L. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) whose association with clathrin coats in the Golgi is controversial (36Simpson F. Peden A.A. Christopoulou L. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 37Dell'Angelica E.C. Kluperman J. Stoorvogel W. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1998; 280: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Both, AP-1 and COP-I bind to target membranes in association with a small GTPase ARF1 (for ADP-ribosylation factor 1) (38Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). GDP-GTP exchange on ARF occurs concomitant with binding; inhibition of exchange by BFA blocks the assembly of these coat proteins. Do coat proteins participate in polarized membrane trafficking? Recent in vitro binding studies revealed that AP-1 adaptors interact with tyrosine-based basolateral sorting motif and with a di-leucine signal artificially introduced into the influenza hemagglutinin's (HA) C-terminal domain (39Heliker R. Manning-Krieg U. Zuber J.-F. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), but the function of these interactions in basolateral trafficking of the HA mutant is unknown. Basolateral targeting of the pIgR from the TGN is significantly inhibited by BFA (40Hunziker W. Whitney J.A. Mellman I. Cell. 1991; 57: 1-20Google Scholar, 41Apodaca G. Aroeti B. Tang K. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20380-20385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Reich V. Mostov K. Aroeti B. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2133-2139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that BFA-sensitive coat proteins regulate pIgR exocytosis from the TGN to the basolateral surface. The cytoplasmic tail of pIgR contains a phosphorylated Ser, Ser-726, that functions in rapid internalization of the pIgR in the basolateral plasma membrane via clathrin-coated pits (43Okamoto C.T. Song W. Bomsel M. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15676-15682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This Ser-based motif resides in a putative CKII/PKA phosphorylation site upstream to a di-leucine motif with yet undefined function (see Fig.1 A and Ref. 43Okamoto C.T. Song W. Bomsel M. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15676-15682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this respect this motif is interesting as it resembles to the putative CKII/PKA motif present in the cytoplasmic tail of cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR), shown to serve as an AP-1-binding site (44Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17110-17115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Mauxion F. Le Borgne R. Munier-Lehmann H. Hoflack B. J. Biol.

These observations led us to propose that AP-1 adaptors bind to the Ser-726 motif of pIgR and that these interactions may facilitate certain steps in basolateral exocytosis of the receptor. The goal of the work reported herein was to identify these interactions and to examine their role in pIgR trafficking from the TGN to the basolateral cell surface in polarized MDCK cells. We find that the AP-1 adaptor complex associates with the wild-type pIgR cytoplasmic tail in vivo and that the interactions are diminished when Ser-726 is mutated to Ala. The interactions with AP-1 seem to commence in the TGN, persist, and/or are even enhanced in post-TGN compartments. Interestingly, the TGN to basolateral delivery of pIgR-Ser-726 to Ala mutant appears to be significantly slower than that of the wild-type receptor. In addition, unlike the wild-type receptor, the basolateral pathway of this pIgR mutant is completely insensitive to the action of BFA. Our results indicate that AP-1 interactions play a regulatory role in prompting efficient basolateral transport of the pIgR from the TGN, and they also suggest the existence of multiple mechanisms that direct membrane proteins from the TGN to the basolateral surface in MDCK cells. MDCK cells expressing the wild-type or mutant receptors were maintained for up to 10 passages in minimal Eagle's medium (MEM, Biological Industries Co, Beit Haemek, Israel) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Biological Industries Co, Beit Haemek, Israel), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2, 95% air. In our experiments we used three MDCK cell lines that stably express the wild-type pIgR (“pIgR-WT”). One previously described cell line generated by cell transfection with the retroviral pWE vector has been used (26Casanova J.E. Breitfeld P.P. Ross S.A. Mostov K.E. Science. 1990; 248: 742-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Two additional cell lines were generated by transfecting MDCK cells with the wild-type pIgR cDNA subcloned into the BglII sites of cytomegalovirus-based pCB6 or pCB7 vectors, as described previously (19Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 46Brewer C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In some cases, MDCK cells expressing pIgR mutants at levels comparable to those of the wild-type receptor were generated by transfecting the cells with cDNA encoding mutant receptors subcloned into the pCB6 vector. Polarized MDCK cells expressing receptors were isolated and characterized as described (19Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 20Aroeti B. Mostov K.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2297-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Two clones expressing the “pIgR R654stop” mutant, where all but two residues of the cytoplasmic tail have been deleted (47Mostov K.E. de Bruyn Kops A. Deitcher D.L. Cell. 1986; 47: 359-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), have been isolated and their exocytic transport characteristics were analyzed and found to be identical to those described for the earlier characterized expressors (47Mostov K.E. de Bruyn Kops A. Deitcher D.L. Cell. 1986; 47: 359-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The pIgR-Δ 655–668 mutant whose 15 of the 17 residues comprising the basolateral sorting signal have been deleted in-frame is delivered from the TGN directly to the apical surface (27Casanova J.E. Apodaca G. Mostov K.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 65-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Newly isolated pIgR-Δ655–668 expressing MDCK clones revealed identical exocytic transport properties to the originally described clone (27Casanova J.E. Apodaca G. Mostov K.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 65-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The previously described MDCK clones expressing pIgR S726A, whose Ser at position 726 in the cytoplasmic tail was mutated to Ala, have been used. This mutation does not abrogate pIgR sorting from the TGN to the basolateral surface, but it inhibits its endocytosis from that surface (43Okamoto C.T. Song W. Bomsel M. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15676-15682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression level was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis of equal protein amounts derived from SDS-cell lysates followed by immunoblotting and probing with polyclonal sheep anti-SC antibodies and appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies. Protein bands were detected using the SuperSignal® chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Autoradiograms were scanned at 300 dpi resolution using the HP ScanJet IIcx scanner, and band intensity was quantified by the NIH image 1.61 software. Mounting of figures was performed using the Adobe PhotoshopTM 3.05 (Adobe Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA) and Aldus Freehand 5.02, Macromedia Inc. Autoradiograms showing the expression of selected pIgR mutants relative to the wild-type pIgR are depicted in Fig. 1 B. MDCK cells expressing the wild-type receptor were grown on Transwell filters (Costar, 0.4 μm) for 3–4 days. Cells on filters were fixed for 10 min in methanol at −20 °C, blocked, immunostained for pIgR and γ-adaptin, mounted, and stored as described previously (24Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The primary sheep anti-rabbit SC antibody was purified on protein-A Sepharose and used at 20 μg/ml concentration to label the pIgR. The 100/3 (Sigma Immunochemicals, Rehovot, Israel) antibody was used at 1:200 dilution to label the γ-adaptin. The R40.76 anti-ZO-1 rat monoclonal antibody (48Anderson J.M. Stevenson B.R. Jesatis L.A. Goodenough D.A. Mooseker M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) was used at 1:250 dilution to label the tight junction-associated protein ZO-1. In some experiments, cells were treated with 10 μg/ml BFA for 15 min at 37 °C prior to fixation. Anti-sheep secondary antibodies conjugated to either fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), anti-rat-conjugated tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC), or anti-mouse coupled to Texas Red were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch and used at recommended dilutions as described (24Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). It should be noted that according to the manufacturer's comments, secondary antibodies were tested for minimal cross-reactivity for IgG and serum proteins of other species. In several experiments, the co-localization between γ-adaptin and internalized IgA was examined. In these experiments IgA was internalized into apical recycling endosome either from the basolateral or the apical plasma membrane as described previously (24Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Cells on filters were then fixed and stained with anti-human IgA antibodies (Sigma), and appropriate secondary antibodies were conjugated to FITC. γ-Adaptins were stained with 100/3 monoclonal antibodies and anti-mouse coupled to Texas Red. A Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal scanhead coupled to a Zeiss Axiovert 135M inverted microscope was used to acquire images of the stained cells, with a 63× oil objective (numerical aperture 1.4). Excitation light was provided by a 100-milliwatt air-cooled argon ion laser run in the multi-line mode. The excitation wavelength was 514 nm and was selected with a suitable interference filter. The relative excitation power level was set to 10% with a neutral density filter. The images presented in this paper were obtained by accumulating (summing) three scans. In order to detect three dyes (FITC, TRITC, and Texas Red) simultaneously, the three detection channels were configured as follows. The fluorescence emission was first split between two channels by a dichroic mirror (555DRLP, 50% point at 550 nm). The low wavelength side of the dichroic was followed by an HQ535/20 (535 nm ± 10 nm) band pass filter. The iris aperture was 2.5–3.0 mm. This channel detected FITC. However, when the TRITC emission was much stronger than the FITC emission, TRITC emission from the tight junctions was also detected in this channel. In post-processing, the output of the TRITC channel was subtracted from the FITC channel to eliminate the contribution of TRITC to this channel. This was particularly effective because the TRITC only stained tight junctions and was therefore well localized and distinct from the FITC emission. The long wavelength side of the first dichroic mirror was split by a second dichroic mirror (605DRHP, 50% point at 605 nm). The short wavelength side of this dichroic mirror was followed by an HQ570/30 (570 nm ± 15 nm) band pass filter. The iris aperture was 0.7–1.7 mm. This channel detected TRITC, as well as FITC. When necessary, the FITC signal as detected in the short wavelength channel described above was subtracted from the output of the TRITC channel. This subtraction was done using the mixer controls on the Bio-Rad MRC-1024. In some cases the TRITC emission was much stronger than the FITC emission, and this subtraction was not required. The long wavelength side of the second dichroic mirror was followed by an HQ655/90 (655 nm ± 45 nm) band pass filter. The iris aperture"

The functions of this protein are apparently regulated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II). We reported evidence for CaM kinase II and a synapsin I-like protein present in mouse insulinoma MIN6 cells (Matsumoto, K., Fukunaga, K., Miyazaki, J., Shichiri, M., and Miyamoto, E. (1995) Endocrinology 136, 3784–3793). Phosphorylation of the synapsin I-like protein in these cells correlated with the activation of CaM kinase II and insulin secretion. In the present study, we screened the MIN6 cDNA library with the full-length cDNA probe of rat brain synapsin Ia and obtained seven positive clones; the largest one was then sequenced. The largest open reading frame deduced from the cDNA sequence of 3695 base pairs encoded a polypeptide of 670 amino acids, which exhibited significant sequence similarity to rat synapsin Ib. The cDNA contained the same sequence as the first exon of the mouse synapsin I gene. These results indicate that synapsin Ib is present in MIN6 cells. Synapsin I was expressed in normal rat islets, as determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Immunoblot analysis after subcellular fractionation of MIN6 cells demonstrated that synapsin Ib and δ subunit of CaM kinase II co-localized with insulin secretory granules. By analogy concerning regulation of neurotransmitter release, our results suggest that phosphorylation of synapsin I by CaM kinase II may induce the release of insulin from islet cells.

Intracellular Ca2+ has been reported to play a critical role in insulin secretion. Glucose seems to elevate intracellular Ca2+ concentrations via influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. The Ca2+ influx primarily occurs as a result of the membrane depolarization secondary to closure of ATP-sensitive K+channels (1Prentki M. Matshinsky F.M. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 1185-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Cell. Signalling. 1990; 2: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 3Rajan A.S. Aguillar-Bryan L. Nelson D.A. Yaney G.C. Hsu W.H. Kunze D.L. Boyd III, A.E. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 340-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). After elevation of intracellular Ca2+levels, effector molecules are activated; these include calmodulin (CaM)1 and protein kinase C. CaM is a ubiquitous Ca2+-binding protein and may be involved in a variety of Ca2+-mediated processes. In fact, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is inhibited by CaM antagonists in rat pancreatic islet cells (4Harrison D.E. Poje M. Rocic B. Ashcroft S.J.H. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). One of the primary effectors of CaM is Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase. Myosin light chain kinase is reported to be involved in insulin secretion (5Niki I. Okazaki K. Saitoh M. Niki A. Niki H. Tamagawa T. Iguchi A. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Myosin light chain kinase phosphorylates the myosin light chain, and activation of the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase is considered to be involved in the movement of secretory granules (1Prentki M. Matshinsky F.M. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 1185-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases have been identified in rat pancreatic islets (6Landt M. McDaniel M.L. Bry C.G. Kotagal N. Colca J.R. Lacy P.E. McDonald J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 7Hughes S.J. Smith H. Ashcroft S.J.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and one of the kinases has kinetic properties similar to Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) (7Hughes S.J. Smith H. Ashcroft S.J.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Indeed, the immunoreactivity of CaM kinase II was detected in rat pancreatic islets when a specific CaM kinase II antibody was used (8Fukunaga K. Goto S. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1070-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). CaM kinase II inhibitors such as KN-62 (9Wenham R.M. Landt M. Walters S.M. Hidaka H. Easom R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10Li G. Hidaka H. Wollheim C.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 489-498PubMed Google Scholar) and KN-93 (5Niki I. Okazaki K. Saitoh M. Niki A. Niki H. Tamagawa T. Iguchi A. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) inhibit glucose-induced insulin secretion from insulinoma cells and rat pancreatic islets. Moreover, an inhibitory peptide of this enzyme attenuated the Ca2+-induced exocytosis in single beta cells (11Ämmälä C. Eliasson L. Bokvist K. Larsson O. Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 472: 665-688Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). CaM kinase II in isolated islets (12Wenham R.M. Landt M. Easom R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4947-4952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse insulinoma cells (13Matsumoto K. Fukunaga K. Miyazaki J. Shichiri M. Miyamoto E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3784-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was activated with glucose. The activation of CaM kinase II was reported to occur in the initial phase and also in the second phase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (14Easom R.A. Filler N.R. Ings E.M. Tarpley J. Landt M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2359-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a role for CaM kinase II in glucose-induced insulin secretion. We reported that inhibition of calcineurin by the specific inhibitor, cyclosporin A, enhances the glucose- and tolbutamide-stimulated insulin secretion from MIN6 cells with stimulation of synapsin I-like protein phosphorylation (15Ebihara K. Fukunaga K. Matsumoto K. Shichiri M. Miyamoto E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5255-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that insulin secretion from MIN6 cells is regulated by CaM kinase II and protein phosphatase with a concomitant phosphorylation of synapsin I-like protein. To better understand the physiological roles of CaM kinase II in insulin secretion, investigation should focus on the endogenous substrate(s) for CaM kinase II. One of the most attractive candidates for substrates involved in stimulus-secretion coupling is synapsin I (16Greengard P. Valtorta F. Czernik J. Benfenati F. Science. 1993; 259: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar, 17Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7849-7852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synapsin I is a family member of proteins highly specific to nerve terminals and comprises four homologous proteins, synapsin Ia and Ib and synapsin IIa and IIb. Synapsin Ia and Ib were discovered as endogenous substrates for cyclic AMP- and Ca2+-dependent protein kinases and were subsequently found to be synaptic vesicle-associated proteins. They appear to play key roles in structural organization of the presynaptic compartment and in regulation of neurotransmitter release. The dephosphorylated form of synapsin I binds to synaptic vesicles with a high affinity. The phosphorylation of synapsin I by CaM kinase II results in removal of the inhibition of the interaction between synaptic vesicles and plasma membranes and thereby induces concomitant changes in Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release. We reported elsewhere the existence of CaM kinase II and its endogenous substrate, an 84-kDa protein in mouse insulinoma MIN6 cells (13Matsumoto K. Fukunaga K. Miyazaki J. Shichiri M. Miyamoto E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3784-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As the 84-kDa protein had several biochemical and immunochemical properties in common with synapsin I, we tentatively termed it a “synapsin I-like protein.” To clarify whether or not the synapsin I-like protein is a new isoform of synapsin I expressed in endocrine cells, we isolated and sequenced the cDNA clones that hybridized to rat brain synapsin I cDNAs from a cDNA library of MIN6 cells. Sucrose density gradient fractionation of MIN6 cells revealed that the protein and δ subunit of CaM kinase II (CaM kinase II δ) co-localizes with insulin secretory granules. We also found that the protein is present in other endocrine cells.

Total RNA was prepared from rat brain, mouse brain (C57BL/6), and MIN6 cells as described (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63231) Google Scholar). Rat synapsin Ia and Ib cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. P. Greengard (Rockefeller University). For RNA transfer blots, 5, 5, and 20 μg of total RNAs from rat and mouse brains and MIN6 cells, respectively, were denatured with formaldehyde, electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane. Following overnight hybridization, the membranes were washed once in each of the following solutions prior to autoradiography: (a) 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min; (b) 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min; and (c) 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 65 °C and exposed to x-ray film.

The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP to a specific activity of 2.9 × 109 cpm/μg with the Random Primer Kit (Takara Biomedicals), as described by the manufacturer. The plaque hybridization assay was performed in 0.9 m NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.7), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Ficoll 400, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 0.1% SDS in the presence of 100 μg/ml denatured herring DNA at 65 °C. The final wash of membranes was carried out in 0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, and 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 60 min. The pBluescript SK(−) phagemids containing cDNA inserts were recovered from purified positive phage clones following the procedures outlined in the Rapid Excision Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The nucleotide sequence was determined using the DyeDeoxyTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit or PRISM Sequenase® Terminator Double-Stranded DNA Sequencing Kit and model 373S DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Japan, Chiba, Japan). Islets were isolated by collagenase digestion from the pancreas of Wistar rats, as described (26Gotoh M. Maki T. Kiyoizumi T. Satomi S. Monaco A.P. Transplantation. 1985; 40: 437-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Although the preparation of islets would contain non-beta cells, they would be less than 10–20% of all the islet cell population, as described (27Bergsten P. Grapengiesser E. Gylfe E. Tengholm A. Hellman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8749-8753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Pralong W.F. Bartley C. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Therefore, more than 80% would be beta cells. Total cellular RNA was extracted from isolated islets using a TriZOL Total RNA Isolation Kit (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The total RNA was reverse-transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer (Promega) and Moloney murine leukemia virus transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Primers used for the cDNA synthesis were designed to span alternatively spliced fragments thereby allowing size discrimination between synapsin Ia and Ib. Primers used to amplify synapsin I cDNA were 5′-AGGCTACCCGTCAGGCATCTATCTC-3′ and 5′-TCACCTCATCCTGGCTAAGG-3′ (nucleotides 1759–1783 and 2120–2139, a 380-base pair fragment of synapsin Ia or nucleotides 1759–1783 and 2082–2101, a 342-base pair fragment of synapsin Ib) (29Südhof T.C.

PCR amplification consisted of a 5-min start at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles at 95 °C for 45 s, 65 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 2 min, and a final cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. For sequencing of PCR products, each PCR fragment was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated into the pCRTMII cloning vector following procedures outlined in the original TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). MIN6 cells grown in ten 100-mm dishes to 90% confluency were harvested by trypsinization, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 5 volumes of the homogenizing buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mmEDTA, 10 mm MES (pH 6.5), 1 mm(p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 75 μm pepstatin A, and 0.1 mg of aprotinin/ml), and homogenized in a Teflon glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 6000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was loaded onto the top of a continuous sucrose density gradient (0.5–2 m sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, and 10 mm MES, pH 6.5) and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 6 h in a swing rotor (RPS55T-2, Hitachi Koki Co., Katsuta, Ibaraki, Japan) (30Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fractions (300 μl each) were collected from the top of the gradient and used for immunoblot analysis and the insulin assay. Insulin content in each fraction was determined using the insulin assay kit (Phadeseph Insulin). The cells and tissue of bovine adrenal medulla were homogenized with 5 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4 mm EGTA, 4 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 75 μm pepstatin A, and 0.1 mg of aprotinin/ml. The homogenate was centrifuged at 16,350 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C using a desk top centrifuge. The resulting supernatant was used as the crude cytosol fraction. The pellet was homogenized with 5 volumes of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 4 mm EGTA, 10 mm EDTA, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 200 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and protease inhibitors described above and centrifuged at 16,350 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant served as the crude particulate fraction. In foregoing work, we identified the synapsin I-like protein in MIN6 cells (13Matsumoto K. Fukunaga K. Miyazaki J. Shichiri M. Miyamoto E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3784-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). If the protein is an isoform of synapsin I expressed in insulinoma cells, cDNA probes corresponding to full-length nucleotides of synapsin Ia or Ib could hybridize to the mRNA of the protein. In fact, we noted the expression of 3.7-kilobase mRNA in MIN6 cells by Northern blot analysis with either cDNA probe (Fig. 1). No other mRNA bands were detected, even under conditions of low stringency (data not shown). Because the synapsin I-like protein is the major protein that immunoreacted with the anti-synapsin I antibody (13Matsumoto K. Fukunaga K. Miyazaki J. Shichiri M. Miyamoto E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3784-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it seemed plausible that the synapsin I-like protein originated from the 3.7-kilobase mRNA. To clarify this point, we cloned the cDNA that hybridized with rat synapsin I cDNA. Approximately 1.1 × 105 independent λZap phage clones from a cDNA library of MIN6 cells were screened with the32P-labeled synapsin Ia cDNA probe, and seven positive clones were obtained. The cDNA inserts from these clones were further characterized by restriction mapping analysis and partial sequence determination of their 5′-ends. One of these clones, designated sim5, contained a full-length open reading frame and was further analyzed (Figs. 2 and3). The largest open reading frame deduced from the 3695-base pair sequence of the sim5cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 670 amino acids, which exhibited a significant sequence similarity to rat synapsin Ib (97.8% identity). All seven serine residues phosphorylated in bovine (31Hall F.L. Mitchell J.P. Vulliet P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6944-6948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Matsubara M. Kusubata M. Ishiguro K. Uchida T. Titani K. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21108-21113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), rat, and human synapsin I are present in the mouse sequence (Fig. 2). Furthermore, sim5 contained a nucleotide sequence identical to the first exon of mouse brain synapsin I gene (33Chin L.-S. Li L. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18507-18513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.3 A). Thus, we concluded that sim5 originated from the gene that encodes mouse brain synapsin I. Eleven amino acids were different from rat brain synapsin Ib, and three additional amino acids (Gln421, Pro422, and Thr601) were observed in the synapsin Ib of MIN6 cells.Figure 3Analyses of clones of synapsin I obtained from MIN6 cDNA library. A, comparison of the nucleotide sequences of sim5 with those of the first exon from mouse synapsin I (m.synI) (31Hall F.L. Mitchell J.P. Vulliet P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6944-6948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). B, comparison of the nucleotide sequence of sim2 with those ofsim5, rat synapsin Ia (Syn Ia), and rat synapsin Ib (Syn Ib) (29Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H.-T. Takai K. Johnston P.A. Horiuchi A. Kanazir S.D. Wagner S.D. Perin M.S. De Camilli P. Greengard P. Science. 1989; 245: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The sim2 clone contains 38-base nucleotides deleted by alternative splicing in mRNA of rat synapsin Ib.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In neuronal cells, the primary transcript of the synapsin I gene was alternatively spliced, and two isoforms, Ia and Ib, were generated (29Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H.-T. Takai K. Johnston P.A. Horiuchi A. Kanazir S.D. Wagner S.D. Perin M.S. De Camilli P. Greengard P. Science. 1989; 245: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). These two isoforms differed in their carboxyl termini, and this alternative splicing mechanism was reported to be conserved well among human, rat, and bovine cells (17Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7849-7852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the synapsin I-like protein, an autoradiograph of the immunoblot analysis showed another faint band at position ∼88 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after long exposure to the x-ray film (data not shown). Therefore, we investigated the possibility that synapsin Ia might be present in MIN6 cells. Using primers spanning the splice acceptor site on the primary RNA transcript, we found that one clone designatedsim2 had 38 nucleotides that were not present in rat brain synapsin Ib mRNA (Fig. 3 B). The 38 nucleotides were the same as those expressed in rat brain synapsin Ia. sim2 did not contain the complete open reading frame of synapsin Ia, yet when the 38 nucleotides were inserted into the sim5 sequence and transferred to amino acids, the sequence homology between rat brain synapsin Ia and the putative full-length sim2 transcript was 94.2% (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the mRNA of mouse synapsin Ia is also expressed in MIN6 cells. To determine whether rat pancreatic islets express synapsin Ia and/or Ib, we prepared total RNA from rat islets. When the total RNA from MIN6 cells and rat islets was subjected to RT-PCR, two amplified products were obtained (Fig. 4). When PCR amplification was performed without reverse transcriptase reaction, these two bands were not detected. When genomic DNA from rat liver was used as a template, an approximately 1330-base pair band was amplified. All three products hybridized with the synapsin Ib cDNA probe (data not shown). These observations mean that the former two products were not amplified from genomic DNA. When we subcloned the two products for sequencing, we confirmed that they were the predicted fragments of synapsin Ia and Ib (data not shown). In neuronal cells, peptide and nonpeptide neurotransmitters are packed in large density core vesicles and synaptic vesicles, respectively, and synapsin I was reported to be associated with synaptic vesicles rather than large density core vesicles (34Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 219-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Large density core vesicles were considered to be counterparts of the secretory granules in endocrine cells. In addition to insulin secretory granules, islet beta cells were seen to have synaptic vesicle-like microvesicles, which contain γ-aminobutyric acid and glutamic acid decarboxylase (35Reetz A. Solimena M. Matteoli M. Folli F. Takei K. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). From these data, we considered the possibility that synapsin I in MIN6 cells is associated with microvesicles but not with insulin secretory granules. We then carried out equilibrium sedimentation through a linear 0.5–2.0m sucrose gradient using the MIN6 cell extracts (Fig.5). Individual fractions were collected, and immunoblot analysis was done with antibodies against synapsin I, synaptophysin, chromogranin A, and CaM kinase II δ. The insulin secretory granule fraction was identified based on measurements of immunoreactive insulin. Fig. 5 summarizes the results of one of four independent experiments. Synapsin I was present in relatively dense fractions, and synaptophysin, a marker for endosomes and small density vesicles, was mainly observed in distinct membrane fractions from synapsin I. A minor peak of synaptophysin was also observed in the insulin secretory granule fraction. Moreover, most of the immunoreactive insulin (Fig. 5 B) and the immunoreactivity of chromogranin A, a marker for large secretory granules (36Winkler H. Fischer-Colbrie R. Neuroscience. 1992; 49: 497-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) (data not shown) and CaM kinase II δ, were detected in the same fractions as synapsin I. Thus, synapsin I was co-fractionated with insulin secretory granules in MIN6 cells. Co-localization of synapsin I with insulin secretory granules was observed in an independent beta cell line, HIT-T15 cells (data not shown). We then asked if synapsin I occurs in other endocrine cells. Fig.6 shows immunoblot analysis of synapsin I in various rodent endocrine cell lines, bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, and adrenal medulla. One immunoreactive protein band migrating at the same position as rat brain synapsin Ib was observed mainly in the particulate fractions from αTC cells and AtT-20 cells. More than four proteins were detected in both cytosol and particulate fractions from In-R1-G9 cells; one migrated at the same position as synapsin Ib, and properties of other immunoreactive proteins were not clear. Protein bands of lower molecular masses were considered to be degraded products. In bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, the two immunoreactive bands observed around the position of synapsin Ib were exclusively present in the particulate fraction. Two immunoreactive bands were also observed in the particulate fraction when freshly isolated bovine adrenal medulla was examined by immunoblot analysis (Fig.6 B). Synapsin I was observed in the cytosol fractions of αTC cells, In-R1-G9 cells, AtT-20 cells, and bovine adrenal medulla. Although small particles are not included in the crude cytosol fraction by the preparation method, the hypotonic conditions would result in the inclusion of the loosely bound proteins of the particulate fraction in the cytosol fraction. When we reported evidence for the existence of synapsin I-like protein in MIN6 cells, the unsolved question was whether or not the protein was a new isoform of synapsin I (13Matsumoto K. Fukunaga K. Miyazaki J. Shichiri M. Miyamoto E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3784-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although synapsin I was not detected in any significant amount in non-neuronal cells by immunoblots, immunohistochemical, and Northern blot analyses and was considered to be neuron-specific (37De Camilli P. Ueda T. Bloom F.E. Battenberg E. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 38Bloom F.E. Ueda T. Battenberg E. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the antibody we used revealed a significant amount of the protein in MIN6 cells. In previous work, the electrophoretic mobility of the protein by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis differed from either synapsin Ia or Ib purified from rat brain. These findings raised the possibility that a new isoform of synapsin I was present in MIN6 cells. In attempts at clarification we isolated cDNA clones of the protein from a cDNA library of MIN6 cells. Sequence analyses of the cDNA clones revealed the expression of synapsin I. Compared with rat brain synapsin Ib, 3 additional amino acids (Gln421, Pro422, and Thr601) and substitution of 11 amino acids were observed in synapsin Ib in MIN6 cells. The difference between these amino acids may be because of species specificity and may explain why the synapsin Ib in MIN6 cells migrated at a higher position than did rat synapsin Ib. Immunoblot analysis of MIN6 cells showed one major band of synapsin I, which was considered to be synapsin Ib, based on the sequence analysis. Another faint band was detected at a slightly higher position than the major band when the autoradiograph was subjected to long exposure to x-ray film. This indicated that synapsin Ia may be expressed in MIN6 cells. We carried out partial sequencing of other clones around the possible splicing site and found that one clone designated assim2 had the sequence of the synapsin Ia cDNA. These findings suggested that synapsin Ia is a minor isoform in MIN6 cells. This preferential expression of two isoforms was in accord with findings that they are differentially expressed among synapses (29Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H.-T. Takai K. Johnston P.A. Horiuchi A. Kanazir S.D. Wagner S.D. Perin M.S. De Camilli P. Greengard P. Science. 1989; 245: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar,39Mandell J.W. Czernk A.J. De Camilli P. Greengard P. Townes-Anderson E. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1736-1749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Functional differences in the synapsin isoforms remain to be elucidated. Synapsin I has been considered a neuron-specific phosphoprotein, although trace positive immunoreactivity of synapsin I was noted in some endocrine cells by immunoblot, immunohistochemical, and Northern blot analyses (29Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H.-T. Takai K. Johnston P.A. Horiuchi A. Kanazir S.D. Wagner S.D. Perin M.S. De Camilli P. Greengard P. Science. 1989; 245: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 33Chin L.-S. Li L. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18507-18513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synapsin I gene promoter contained a sequence motif similar to the neuron restrictive silencer element/repressor element-1 (40Kranar S.D. Chong J.A. Tsay H.-J. Mandel G. Neuron. 1992; 9: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 41Li L. Suzuki T. Mori N. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1460-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and the neuron-specific expression of synapsin I was reported to be under the control of a neuron-specific silencer element and trans-activating factor (42Schoch S. Cibelli G. Thiel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3317-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A zinc finger protein termed neuron restrictive silencer factor (NRSF)/RE-1-silencing transcription factor (REST) was expressed only in non-neuronal cells that bind to this motif and function as a transcriptional repressor (43Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kranar S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 44Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that mRNA coding for NRSF/REST is absent in the insulinoma cell line INS-1 and in three other insulin- and glucagon-producing cell lines (45Atouf F. Czernichow P. Scharfmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1929-1934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In these cells, NRSF/REST activity was absent, and transient expression of NRSF/REST was sufficient to silence a reporter gene containing a NRSF/REST binding site. Our data demonstrated the expression of synapsin I in normal rat islets, endocrine cell lines, and bovine adrenal chromaffin cells and thereby provided further support for the NRSF/REST hypothesis. It would be important to show that REST is absent in MIN6 cells. We demonstrated the expression of synapsin I in isolated islets from rat pancreas by RT-PCR with RNA from islets (Fig. 4). Because sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons innervate pancreatic islets, there may be contamination of nerve endings in the fraction of isolated islets. However, this is not likely because synapsin I is translated from its mRNA in the cell body and is transported to nerve endings. In neuronal cells, two types of vesicles have been described; one is synaptic vesicles that contain non-peptide neurotransmitters, and the other is large density core vesicles that contain peptide neurotransmitters. In neuroendocrine and endocrine cells, secretory granules and small synaptic-like vesicles are thought to be counterparts of large dense core vesicles and synaptic vesicles, respectively. In addition to secretory granules, pancreatic beta cells have small synaptic-like vesicles that contain γ-aminobutyric acid (35Reetz A. Solimena M. Matteoli M. Folli F. Takei K. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Although synapsin I has been reported to be associated only with synaptic vesicles or synaptic-like microvesicles in rat and bovine neurohypophysis (46Navone F. Di Gioia G. Jahn R. Browning M. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3425-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we found that synapsin I was not present in fractions that contained synaptic-like microvesicles, as determined by immunoblot analysis using the anti-synaptophysin antibody but was associated with secretory granules. In agreement with our observation, synaptic-like microvesicles in pinealocytes were not found to interact with synapsin I, as demonstrated immunohistochemically (47Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In endocrine and neuroendocrine cells, synapsin I can be absent on synaptic-like microvesicles. In this context, it is important that ribbon synapses in cone, rod, and bipolar cells of the retina with synaptic-like microvesicles do not contain synapsin I (48Koontz M.A. Hendrickson A.E. Synapse. 1993; 14: 268-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). One of the functional roles of synapsin I in neuronal cells was reported to be the regulation of neurotransmitter release (17Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7849-7852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Greengard et al. (16Greengard P. Valtorta F. Czernik J. Benfenati F. Science. 1993; 259: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar) hypothesized that synapsin I forms the link between the vesicle membrane and a primarily actin-based cytoskeleton, thus preventing the vesicles from moving to the presynaptic plasma membrane. The increase in cytosolic Ca2+levels causes phosphorylation of synapsin I by CaM kinase II, which results in the release of vesicles from the cytoskeletal network and transfer of the vesicles from a resting to an active pool. In pancreatic beta cells, the actin network beneath the plasma membrane may prevent the interaction between secretory granules and plasma membranes (49Orci L. Diabetes. 1982; 31: 538-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). By analogy with neuronal cells, synapsin I in beta cells may possibly function as a linker of insulin granules and the cytoskeletal network. CaM kinases were reported to be present in pancreatic beta cells, including CaM kinase II (8Fukunaga K. Goto S. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1070-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), CaM kinase III (7Hughes S.J. Smith H. Ashcroft S.J.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and myosin light chain kinase (5Niki I. Okazaki K. Saitoh M. Niki A. Niki H. Tamagawa T. Iguchi A. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Among these, only CaM kinase II was reported to be present in particulate fractions, which contained insulin secretory granules (7Hughes S.J. Smith H. Ashcroft S.J.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). CaM kinase activity and endogenous substrates have been shown to be present in insulin secretory granules from toadfish (50Watkins D.T. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in other insulinoma INS-1 cells, the CaM kinase II δ was seen to be associated with insulin secretory granules (51Möhlig M. Wolter S. Mayer P. Lang J. Osterhoff M. Horn P.A. Schatz H. Pfeiffer A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2577-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We also confirmed the association of CaM kinase II δ with insulin secretory granules in MIN6 cells by sucrose gradient subcellular fractionation and immunoblot analysis with an antibody specific to CaM kinase II δ (Fig. 5). Taken together, it is plausible that CaM kinase II is present on the surface of insulin secretory granules. In the present work, we observed that synapsin I co-localizes with secretory granules. In the brain, synapsin I has been reported to be complexed with CaM kinase II α on the synaptic vesicle surface (52Benfenati F. Valtorta F. Rubenstein J.L. Gorelick F.S. Greengard P. Czernik A.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We suggest that synapsin I may be associated with CaM kinase II δ on insulin secretory granules. We thank Dr. H.

Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) have published a revised sequence of the stromelysin promoter region based on 12 independently isolated genomic clones. Their work indicates that the clone used in previous studies contained a 1-kilobase deletion and an inversion at the 5′ end. Thus, previous studies would have missed any regulatory elements in the deleted portion and may have over- or underestimated the importance of other elements by studying them in an incorrect context. Although 5′ deletion analysis has been used successfully in the past, there is some concern that such studies might fail to identify elements and factors whose roles are more subtle and that transcription elements are best studied in larger constructs that more closely resemble the natural context (17Sanz L.

To identify transcription factors andcis elements potentially involved in the IL-1 induction of stromelysin, the human stromelysin 5′-flanking region was screened by EMSA for previously unidentified IL-1-induced DNA-binding complexes in human fibroblasts. Here we report the identification of such a complex and present evidence that it is a repressor of IL-1-induced expression of the stromelysin gene. Human synovial fibroblasts are obtained from the synovia of patients with osteoarthritis undergoing reconstructive and restorative surgery, and gingival fibroblasts are obtained from patients undergoing periodontal surgery or surgical removal of third molars. Tissue samples are processed by enzymatic dispersion to produce primary cultures as described previously (16Borden P. Song K. Heller R.A.

These cultures are maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic/antimycotic (penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells in passages 5–8 were used in experiments. Cultures were serum-deprived for 16 h in serum-free Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% insulin, transferrin, and sodium selenite (Sigma) prior to stimulation with 100 ng of IL-1β/ml (a generous gift of Robert Newton, DuPont-Merck Pharmaceutical Co.). Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) (ATCC) were maintained and treated in the same manner described above. Cells in passages 5–10 were used in transfection experiments. Nuclear extracts were isolated from synovial, gingival, or human foreskin fibroblast cultures at various times after stimulation with IL-1β (100 ng/ml), as well as from control cultures, according to the method of Schreiber et al. (21Schreiber E. Matthais P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). DNA fragments used as probes for promoter dissection were generated by PCR according to standard protocols (primer 1, 5′-CACTGCCACCACTCTGTTCTC-3′; primer 2, 5′-TTCTATGGTTCTCCATTCCTT-3′). This DNA fragment as well as the complementary oligodeoxynucleotide pairs (4, 5′-ACAAGACATGGTTTTTTCCCCCCATCAAAG-3′; 4B (SIRE), 5′-GTTTTTTCCCCCCATCAAAG-3′) were end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]dATP. Binding reactions contained 5 or 10 μg of protein, 20 mmHepes-OH, pH 7, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2 m EDTA, 5% glycerol, 4 μg of poly(dI-dC), and a 10,000 cpm probe. Samples were electrophoresed on native 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE (44.5 mm Tris-Cl, 50 mm boric acid, 3 mm EDTA). An oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the SIRE binding site was labeled with bromodeoxyuridine and32P. Binding reactions containing 40 μg of gingival nuclear extract, were isolated 1 h after stimulation with 100 ng of IL-1β/ml in the presence or absence of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and were exposed to UV light (Macrovue Transilluminator, LKB) for 15 min before being electrophoresed in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis beside prestained molecular mass markers. A fragment of human stromelysin 5′-flanking region corresponding to the sequences published by Borden et al. (16Borden P. Song K. Heller R.A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dinesh Tewari, Temple University, Philadelphia. A 2050-base pair fragment was subcloned first into pBluescript SK−, then into the pGL3Basic luciferase reporter vector (KpnI/AvaI) (Promega). The ΔSac construct was made by excising theKpnI/SacI fragment containing the binding site of interest filling in the ends and re-ligating. The binding site of interest was altered by site-directed mutagenesis using the four primer PCR method (22Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 177-183Google Scholar) and mutant oligonucleotides (primer 1, 5′-GGTACAAGGTACCATTGA-3′; primer 2, 5′-CTTTGATGGTGAGAAAAAA-3′; primer 3, 5′-GTTTTTTCTCACCATCAAAG-3′; primer 4, 5′-CACAGGTGATAGCCACTTG-3′). The resulting fragment was digested withKpnI and SacI and used to replace the wild-typeKpnI/SacI fragment in pGLStro. Each of these stromelysin constructs was transiently transfected into HFF cells along with a β-galactosidase gene under control of the SV40 promoter (SVβGal) (Promega) as a control for transfection efficiency. Transfection was accomplished in triplicate samples using 20 μg of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in serum-free Eagle's minimum essential medium. Approximately 16 h after transfection, the transfection medium was removed and replaced with serum-free Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% insulin, transferrin, and sodium selenite, along with 100 ng of IL-1β/ml where appropriate. Cells were harvested 24 h later, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were determined using reagents and protocols from Promega and CLONTECH, respectively. Luciferase values were normalized to levels of β-galactosidase. Data shown are from three independent experiments done in triplicate. A 2-kilobase fragment of the human stromelysin 5′-flanking region was subcloned into pBluescript SK− (Stratagene). Because the proximal promoter has already been well studied, the region upstream of −480 starting from the 5′ end at −2000 was screened for IL-1-induced DNA-binding proteins. 100-base pair fragments were generated by PCR and screened by EMSA using nuclear extracts isolated from synovial and gingival fibroblast cultures treated with 100 ng of IL-1β/ml. One of these fragments, −1693 to −1575, was selected for further study because of the strength and reproducibility of the IL-1-induced binding. Two DNA-binding complexes were observed, which were both increased by treatment with IL-1. The more slowly migrating complex 1 was absent in the control, induced within 30 min, and maintained for at least 12 h. The smaller complex 2 was often present in the control but further increased at 3, 6, and 12 h after the addition of IL-1 (Fig. 1). The same binding pattern was observed with multiple sets of nuclear extract isolated from both synovial and gingival fibroblasts, although the presence of complex 2 in control samples was somewhat variable. To determine where on the 100-base pair fragment the IL-1-induced binding occurred, overlapping sets of oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized, as shown in Fig.2 A, and used as probes in additional EMSA experiments. Only fragment 4 (−1624 to −1595) showed a pattern of IL-1-induced binding similar to that observed with the larger, PCR-generated probe. IL-1-induced binding to this fragment was specific as demonstrated by the fact that it could be easily competed by the autologous fragment 4 but was not competed with even 100-fold excess of fragment 5 (Fig. 2 B). Fragment 4 was further divided into smaller fragments, 4A and 4B. Again, the IL-1-induced pattern of binding originally observed with the 100-base pair fragment was seen only with fragment 4B (−1614 to −1595) (Fig.3).Figure 3Mutation of two nucleotides in probe 4B abolishes DNA binding. The same nuclear extract (5 μg) isolated from human gingival fibroblasts at the indicated times after stimulation with IL-1 was incubated with both wild-type (5′-GTTTTTTCCCCCCATCAAAG-3′) and mutant (5′-GTTTTTTCTCACCATCAAAG-3′)32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes as shown.

To determine whether or not the Cs were involved in the IL-1-induced binding, a mutant probe was synthesized in which two of the Cs were altered. As shown in Fig. 3, this mutation abrogated the IL-1-induced binding, suggesting that at least one of the mutated Cs is essential for binding. This binding site was designated SIRE. As a first step in further characterization of DNA binding to the SIRE site, the ability of cytokines other than IL-1 to induce binding was investigated. As shown in Fig. 4, tumor necrosis factor α also induces binding to this site, but the pattern of binding is different from that of IL-1; the smaller complex 2 is much more prominent than complex 1 at 6 h. Neither platelet-derived growth factor nor IL-4 was able to induce either complex. Although IL-4 has been shown to suppress some of the activities of IL-1 (23Borghaei R.C. Rawlings Jr., P.L.

Kuroda A. Mino T. Yamashita N. Kobayashi M. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1996; 55: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), IL-4 did not inhibit the IL-1 induction of binding to the SIRE site when added simultaneously with IL-1. To begin to characterize the protein(s) binding to the SIRE site, gingival fibroblasts were stimulated with IL-1 in the presence and absence of cycloheximide prior to isolation of nuclear extracts. Results of EMSA analysis, shown in Fig.5, show a slight increase in the intensity of the larger complex 1 at 1, 3, and 6 h. The intensity of the smaller complex 2 was unaffected at 1 h but decreased at 3 and 6 h. Interestingly, there appeared to be a slight increase in the mobility of complex 2 in extracts exposed to cycloheximide. These results suggest that de novo protein synthesis is not required for binding to the SIRE site and that the two complexes are regulated independently of each other. UV cross-linking experiments were undertaken to begin to characterize the protein composition of the IL-1-induced binding to the SIRE site and to determine whether the altered migration of complex 2 in the presence of cycloheximide was more likely because of a different protein composition or potential differences in post-translational processing. The SIRE probe was tagged with bromodeoxyuridine and labeled with32P before incubation with nuclear extracts isolated from gingival fibroblasts induced with IL-1 in the presence and absence of cycloheximide. Following exposure to UV irradiation, the reactions were then separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis beside molecular mass standards. Results, shown in Fig.6, show that there are at least two proteins binding to the SIRE site, of approximately 48 and 52 kDa, and that the same two proteins are observed in the presence of cycloheximide. Transient transfection experiments were conducted to determine what role, if any, the SIRE site and its binding protein(s) play in the IL-1 induction of stromelysin gene expression. The entire 2-kilobase fragment was subcloned into the pGL3Basic luciferase reporter (Promega) as a wild-type construct, and a deletion mutant (ΔSac) was constructed by deleting stromelysin sequences upstream of the SacI site at −1477. Because of poor transfection efficiency in synovial and gingival fibroblasts, transient transfection experiments were done in HFF cells, which showed an identical pattern of IL-1-induced binding to the SIRE probe (Fig.7). The luciferase constructs were co-transfected along with SVβgal as a control for transfection efficiency. Interestingly, the ΔSac construct consistently showed a higher IL-1 induction than the wild-type construct (Fig.8), suggesting that the deleted sequences may contain a repressor element.Figure 8Site-directed mutagenesis of the SIRE site increases IL-1-induced transcription from the stromelysin promoter. Subconfluent cultures of human foreskin fibroblasts were co-transfected with SVβ-gal along with a stromelysin luciferase reporter construct. pGLStro contains a 2-kilobase fragment of the wild-type stromelysin promoter; pGLΔSac is a deletion mutant missing the SIRE region, and pGLmStro is a mutant construct with the SIRE region altered as shown in Fig. 3. Results are from three independent experiments performed in triplicate and normalized with β-galactosidase for transfection efficiency and expressed as fold IL-1 induction. Basal activities were similar for all three constructs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To verify these results and to determine more precisely the role of the SIRE site in its natural context, the wild-type construct was altered by site-directed mutagenesis to reflect the sequence of the mutation already shown to abrogate binding in EMSA. Results, shown in Fig. 8, were consistent with those obtained with the deletion mutant showing an IL-1 induction approximately twice that of the wild-type construct. Results are from three independent experiments performed in triplicate, and the basal activities of all three constructs were very similar. The stromelysin 1 gene encodes a metalloproteinase with broad substrate specificity that plays an important role in tissue remodeling and wound repair (1Woessner Jr., J.F.

Adler R.R. Matrix. 1992; 1 (suppl.): 337-343Google Scholar). However, in chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis, it is found in abnormally high levels and has therefore been linked to the joint and tissue destruction associated with these diseases (28Reynolds J.J. Hembry R.M. Meikle M.C. Adv. Dent. Res. 1994; 8: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 30Beekman B. van El B. Drijfhout J.W. Ronday H.K. TeKoppele J.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of stromelysin expression by inflammatory cytokines may provide new insight into potential therapies aimed at limiting the tissue destruction of chronic inflammation. The data presented here identify an IL-1-inducible repressor of stromelysin gene expression. Site-directed mutagenesis of the binding site resulted in 2-fold greater induction of the mutant construct as compared with the wild-type construct in HFF cells. UV cross-linking suggests the presence of at least two proteins, and results of cycloheximide experiments suggest that the two binding complexes are regulated independently of each other. The composition of the binding complexes was not determined (i.e. two monomersversus homo- or heterodimers); however, the results so far are consistent with two monomers binding separately. Although the physiological significance of this repressor is unknown, it seems likely that repressor binding and/or activity may also be modified by other cytokines or growth factors in vivo. In fact, binding to the SIRE site is also enhanced by tumor necrosis factor albeit with a somewhat different pattern of complexes. The presence of such a repressor element might therefore serve as a mechanism to “fine tune” the levels of a gene product with a critical but potentially destructive function in tissue remodeling preventing its overexpression. Interestingly, although IL-4 has been shown to inhibit the IL-1 induction of stromelysin expression in synovial fibroblasts (23Borghaei R.C. Rawlings Jr., P.L. Mochan E. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1398-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), it does not appear to do so by inducing binding to this repressor element. It is important to note that this binding site has also been identified as the site of a common genetic polymorphism. Ye et al. (31Ye S. Watts G.F. Mandalia S. Humphries S.E. Henney A.M. Br. Heart J. 1995; 73: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar,32Ye S. Eriksson P. Hamsten A. Kurkinen M. Humphries S.E. Henney A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13055-13060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) have reported that the presence of six Ts at this site rather than five is associated with more rapid progression of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, they presented evidence that this element acts as a repressor element in human fibroblasts, because the transcriptional activity of a 6T reporter construct was about one-half of a 5T construct in the presence of serum. They hypothesize that the more rapid disease progression is because of decreased expression of stromelysin resulting in decreased degradation of the atherosclerotic plaques. Our finding that binding to this element is induced by inflammatory cytokines but not by the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 or the mitogen platelet-derived growth factor may have interesting implications for a number of diseases involving both inflammation and tissue remodeling. For example, it is tempting to speculate that individuals with the 5T polymorphism might experience more rapid progression and/or increased tissue destruction in chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis because of increased expression of stromelysin in response to inflammation. However, because mutation of this site results in increased IL-1-induced transcriptional activity compared with the 5T wild type, the site is likely to be active as a repressor element even in individuals with the 5T polymorphism. Further study of this element and the proteins binding to it is necessary to determine the in vivo significance of both the repressor and the polymorphism, as well as the feasibility of modifying disease progression by overexpression of these proteins.

Using chimeric rat N2/N1 transporters, we previously demonstrated that transmembrane domains (TM) 8 and 9 are the major sites for substrate binding and discrimination. Interestingly, when TM8 of N2 was replaced by that of N1, the resulting chimera, T8, lost the pyrimidine selectivity of N2 and accepted both purine and pyrimidine nucleosides. Five residues differ between rat N2 and N1 in TM8. To identify the critical residues responsible for transport selectivity, the five residues in N2 were systematically changed to their equivalents in N1. Replacing the serine residue at position 318 to its equivalent N1 residue, glycine, caused N2 to lose its selectivity for pyrimidine nucleosides and accept purine nucleosides as substrates. In contrast, replacing the other four residues did not change the pyrimidine selectivity of N2. Furthermore, when glycine 318 in chimera T8 was changed back to serine, the chimeric transporter regained pyrimidine selectivity. These observations suggest that serine 318 is located in the nucleoside permeation pathway and is responsible for the substrate selectivity of N2.

In mammalian cells, transmembrane flux of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides is mediated by both facilitated and Na+-dependent nucleoside transporters (1Cass C.E. Georgopapadakou N.H.

Na+-nucleoside transporters exhibit distinct transport selectivity for purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and have been classified into several subtypes based on their substrate selectivity (1Cass C.E.

The N1 (or cif) system is selective for purine nucleosides, the N2 (or cit) system is selective for pyrimidine nucleosides, and the N3 (or cib) system is broadly selective (or nonselective), transporting both purine and pyrimidine nucleosides. Uridine, a pyrimidine nucleoside, and adenosine, a purine nucleoside, are ubiquitously transported by all three systems. Recently the N1 and N2 transporters were cloned from rat and human (5Wang J.

Although the cloned N1 and N2 transporters have distinct substrate selectivity for pyrimidine and purine nucleosides, they share a high sequence homology (60–70%) and a similar predicted membrane topology (14 putative transmembrane domains). The broadly selective transporter, N3, was characterized in a number of tissues and cells (10Wu X. Yuan G. Brett C.M. Hui A.C. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8813-8818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Huang Q.Q. Harvey C.M. Paterson A.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. J. Biol.

Regul. 1993; 33: 235-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), but the molecular identity of this transporter is currently unknown. To determine the structural basis for substrate recognition and discrimination in the Na+-nucleoside transporters, we previously took advantage of the high sequence similarity and yet distinct substrate selectivity of the cloned N1 and N2 transporters. By constructing and analyzing a series of chimeric rat N1/N2 transporters, we demonstrated that TMs 8 and 9 are the major sites for substrate binding and discrimination (13Wang J. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28845-28848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when TM8 of N2 was replaced by that of N1, the resulting transporter, chimera T8, lost pyrimidine selectivity and became a broadly selective (or nonselective) transporter that accepts both purine and pyrimidine nucleosides as substrates (13Wang J. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28845-28848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment revealed that 5 amino acid residues differ between rat N2 and N1 in the TM8 region (Fig. 1), suggesting that simultaneous replacement of the five divergent residues in TM8 of N2 with the corresponding residues in N1 would cause N2 to lose its selectivity for pyrimidine nucleosides. It is possible that individual residues in TM8 of N2 may gate the substrate permeation pathway, which would only allow pyrimidine nucleosides and the common substrate, adenosine, to pass through. Substitution of these residues removes the gating validity, resulting in nonselective transporters (e.g. chimera T8), which also allow the passage of purine nucleosides. In this study, we focused on determining the specific residues responsible for maintaining the substrate selectivity of N2. By site-directed mutagenesis, the five residues in N2 were systematically mutated to the corresponding residues in N1. The substrate selectivity of each mutant was subsequently evaluated in the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system. The data suggest that a single residue, serine 318, is responsible for maintaining the pyrimidine selectivity of N2. An adjacent residue, glutamine 319, was found to be important in influencing the apparent affinity for nucleosides. The cDNAs of wild-type rat N1 (SPNT) and N2 (CNT1) transporters were obtained by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (13Wang J. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol.

The mutagenic oligonucleotides were synthesized in the Biochemical Resource Center at the University of California, San Francisco. The Stratagene Chameleon™ and QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene) were used to construct mutant cDNAs following the manufacturer's protocols. Mutants with single amino acid substitutions (S304T, T306A, S310A, S318G, and Q319M) were prepared using the cDNA of wild-type rat N2 as template. The double mutant S318G/Q319M was constructed by introducing a second mutation (Q to M) at position 319 of mutant S318G. The mutant T8.G318S was construct by changing glycine 318 to serine in a previously described chimeric transporter T8 (13Wang J. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28845-28848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The sequence of each mutant was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing using an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Model 373A). Genetics Computer Group software package (Wisconsin Package, Version 9) was used for sequence alignment and helical wheel analysis. cRNA of each mutant was synthesized and injected into defolliculated oocytes as described previously (5Wang J. Su S.F. Dresser M.J. Schaner M.E. Washington C.B. Giacomini K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F1058-F1065PubMed Google Scholar). Uptake was measured on groups of 10 oocytes 48–56 h post-injection at 25 °C in 150 μl of transport buffer (2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing either 100 mm NaCl or 100 mm choline chloride and the respective 3H-labeled nucleoside (Moravek Biochemicals). The kinetic parameters (apparent K mand V max values) were determined by nonlinear least squares fits of substrate/velocity profiles to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Kaleidagraph (Version 3.0, Synergy Software). Because of the intrinsic variability in the expression level of the transporters between batches of oocytes, the data are generally expressed as the mean ±S.E. from experiments performed in the same batch of oocytes. However, experiments were repeated at least twice in separate batches of oocytes. Studies on chimeric transporters showed that replacing TM8 of N2 with that of N1 generated a chimera, T8, which lost the pyrimidine selectivity of N2 (Fig. 2, A–B). To identify the specific residues responsible for maintaining the substrate selectivity of N2, we individually changed the five divergent residues (Fig.1) in TM8 of N2 to the corresponding residues in N1. A double mutant (S318G/Q319M) and a reverse mutant (T8.G318S) were also constructed. Mutants were first screened with the common substrate, [3H]uridine, for activity. Significant Na+-dependent uptake of uridine (10–70-fold increase) was observed for all mutants (data not shown), suggesting that all mutants were expressed and functional. The substrate selectivity of each mutant was examined in uptake experiments using [3H]inosine as the model purine nucleoside and [3H]thymidine as the model pyrimidine nucleoside. The uptake of inosine (10 μm) and thymidine (10 μm) by N2, chimera T8, mutants S304T, T306A, S310A, S318G, Q319M, and S318G/Q319M is shown in Fig.2. Compared with water-injected oocytes, significant Na+-dependent thymidine uptake (13–133-fold increase) was observed in oocytes expressing mutants S304T, T306A, S310A, and Q319M (Fig. 2, C–E and2 G). In contrast, there was no significant inosine uptake by these mutants (Fig. 2. C–E and 2G), suggesting that mutants S304T, T306A, S310A, and Q319M maintained the pyrimidine selectivity of N2. Therefore, single substitutions of these residues in N2 with the corresponding residues in N1 did not affect the substrate selectivity of N2. In contrast, in addition to thymidine, the mutant S318G also transports inosine (Fig. 2 F). In oocytes expressing mutant S318G, there was a 41-fold increase in Na+-dependent inosine uptake (3.27 ± 0.58 pmol/oocyte/30 min for S318G cRNA-injected oocytes versus 0.08 ± 0.01 pmol/oocyte/30 min for water-injected oocytes). These data suggest that changing serine 318 in N2 to its equivalent residue in N1 (glycine) causes N2 to accept inosine as a substrate. However, compared with the transport rate of (10 μm) thymidine (14.90 ± 2.17 pmol/oocyte/30 min), S318G transports inosine (10 μm) at a rate 4.6-fold lower (Fig. 2 F). The data shown in Fig. 2 F were from one representative experiment in which the same batch of oocytes was used. The experiment was performed several times. Although the rate of nucleoside uptake varied among experiments (ranging from 0.71 to 3.3 for inosine and from 4.30 to 15.10 for thymidine, pmol/oocyte/30 min) because of the intrinsic variability in the expression level between batches of oocytes, significant Na+-dependent inosine uptake (16- to 41-fold over water-injected oocytes) was observed in S318G cRNA-injected oocytes in all experiments. Within a single experiment, the thymidine uptake was consistently 4–6-fold higher than the inosine uptake. These data suggest that although mutant S318G accepts purine nucleosides as substrates, it still kinetically favors the transport of pyrimidine nucleosides at the tested concentration (10 μm). Mutant Q319M maintained the substrate selectivity of wild-type N2; however it transports thymidine with a significantly decreased rate (Fig. 2 A and 2 G). Because glutamine 319 is also adjacent to serine 318, we suspect that this residue may play a role in substrate binding. Therefore we introduced a second Q to M mutation at position 319 of mutant S318G. This double mutant, S318G/Q319M, transports 10 μm inosine and thymidine at a comparable but slow rate (1.07 ± 0.20 pmol/oocyte/30 min for inosine and 1.25 ± 0.20 pmol/oocyte/30 min for thymidine), generating an uptake pattern similar to that of chimera T8 (Fig. 2, B andH). These data indicate that changing glutamine 319 to methionine in mutant S318G caused S318G to transport purine and pyrimidine nucleosides without much kinetic bias. The data presented in Fig. 2 suggested that serine 318 is important for maintaining the pyrimidine selectivity of N2. Changing this residue in N2 to glycine causes N2 to lose its substrate selectivity. To investigate whether a reverse mutation can re-establish the pyrimidine selectivity in chimera T8, we changed the glycine 318 in chimera T8 back to the serine residue in N2. Interestingly, this mutant (termed T8.G318S) restored the pyrimidine selectivity of N2, transporting thymidine but not inosine (Fig. 3). These data strongly suggest that serine 318 is essential for maintaining the pyrimidine selectivity of the N2 transporter. To investigate why mutant S318G transports thymidine more favorably than inosine at 10 μm (Fig. 2 F) and how substitution of Q319M in mutant S318G neutralized this imbalance (Fig.2 H), we examined the kinetics of thymidine and inosine uptake mediated by mutant S318G and mutant S318G/Q319M (Fig.4). Uptake of both nucleosides via mutant S318G was saturable (Fig. 4 A). The apparentK m of inosine was 273 ± 62 μm,whereas that of thymidine was 27.5 ± 4.3 μm. TheV max of inosine was 28.8 ± 2.5 pmol/oocyte/30 min, whereas that of thymidine was 24.6 ± 0.9 pmol/oocyte/30 min (Fig. 4 A). These data suggest that mutant S318G has a much lower (∼10-fold) apparent affinity for inosine than for thymidine, whereas the apparent maximal rate of transport,V max, for inosine is close to that for thymidine. Therefore at low substrate concentrations (e.g.10 μm), mutant S318G will favor the transport of thymidine over that of inosine. The uptake of inosine and thymidine mediated by mutant S318G/Q319M was also saturable (Fig. 4 B). For this mutant, the K m of inosine was 54.8 ± 14.7 μm, and the K m of thymidine was 79.3 ± 11.9 μm. The V max of inosine was 10.8 ± 0.7 pmol/oocyte/30 min and that of thymidine was 12.3 ± 0.5 pmol/oocyte/30 min (Fig. 4 B). These data suggest that mutant S318G/Q319M has similar apparentK m and V max values for inosine and thymidine, transporting these two compounds without much kinetic bias. Compared with the mutant S318G (Fig. 4 A), the apparent affinity for inosine in the double mutant is greatly enhanced (K m = 54.8 versus K m = 273 μm, p < 0.01), whereas the apparent affinity for thymidine is significantly decreased (K m = 79.3 versus K m = 24.6 μm, p < 0.01). To analyze the position of serine 318 and glutamine 319 on TM8, helical wheels at a fixed angel of 100° are drawn for TM8 of N2 (Fig. 5). The five substitutions in N1 are indicated by arrows. Distinct amphipathic patterns (one side of the helix being hydrophobic, and the other side hydrophilic) are observed, suggesting that one side of TM8 may face an aqueous pore (e.g. the substrate binding pore), whereas the other side may face the hydrophobic lipid. The residue serine 318 is located in the center of hydrophilic side, suggesting its side chain may directly interact with the substrates. The residue glutamine 319 is located near the boundary of the amphipathic interface. Its side chain may interact directly with the substrates or may contribute indirectly to the conformation of the substrate recognition sites. Our previous studies showed that replacing TM8 of N2 with that of N1 caused N2 to lose its substrate selectivity (13Wang J. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28845-28848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on determining the specific residues responsible for maintaining the substrate selectivity of N2. By site-directed mutagenesis, the five divergent residues in N2 were systematically mutated to the corresponding residues in N1. Replacing serine 318 in N2 to its equivalent residue, glycine, resulted in a mutant (S318G), which lost the pyrimidine selectivity of N2 and began to accept purine nucleosides as substrates (Fig. 2 F). In contrast, replacing the other four residues with their equivalents did not alter the selectivity of N2 (Fig. 2). Importantly, when the glycine residue in the broadly selective chimera T8 was changed back to serine, the resulting transporter (T8.G318S) regained pyrimidine selectivity (Fig.3). These data strongly suggest that serine 318 is essential for conserving the pyrimidine selectivity of wild-type N2. Kinetic studies revealed that mutant S318G has a much lower (∼10-fold) apparent affinity for inosine than for thymidine (Fig.4 A), suggesting that although the ability of a mutant to accept purine nucleosides is determined by whether a serine or a glycine residue is present at position 318, other residues may contribute to the kinetic differences in the transport of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides by mutant S318G. Indeed, a second Q to M mutation at position 319 following the S318G substitution resulted in a mutant (S318G/Q319M), which has comparable apparentK m values for inosine and thymidine (Fig.4 B). These data suggest that although a single substitution of glutamine 319 with methionine would not affect the pyrimidine selectivity of N2 (Fig. 2G), changing it after the serine to glycine substitution at position 318 would greatly enhance the apparent affinity of mutant S318G toward purine nucleosides. In transport kinetic analysis, the apparent affinity (i.e. apparentK m) reflects not only substrate affinity for the binding site but is also influenced by rate constants of substrate translocation and dissociation, which occur subsequent to recognition (14Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12584-12588Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed changes in apparent affinity introduced by the Q to M mutation in the S318G mutant may reflect changes in any of these processes. Studies of a number of membrane transporters suggest that the substrate permeation pathway in a transporter is a channel-like structure formed by several transmembrane helices (15Yan R.T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16Zeng H. Parthasarathy R. Rampal A.L. Jung C.Y. Biophys.

Charged and polar residues, often found on one side of these helices, play critical roles in interacting with the substrates (15Yan R.T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5539-5543Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Merickel A.

Biochem. 1986; 31: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Helical wheel analysis of TM8 revealed a distinct amphipathic pattern (Fig. 5), suggesting that one side of TM8 may face an aqueous channel for substrate permeation. Serine 318 is located in the center of the hydrophilic side (Fig. 5), suggesting that its side chain may protrude into the channel and act as a gating residue through specific interactions with the substrates. Substitution of a serine residue with a smaller residue, glycine, will result in a loss of a methylene and a hydroxyl group on the side chain. These changes may cause a gain in the size of the substrate permeation channel and a loss of some specific chemical interactions (e.g. a hydrogen bond), allowing the resulting transporter S318G to tolerate the bulkier purine nucleosides as substrates. On the helical wheel diagram, the residue glutamine 319 is located near the boundary of the amphipathic interface (Fig. 5). Its side chain may interact directly with the substrates or may affect the apparent affinity by indirect influence of the conformation of the substrate recognition site in the channel. Substitution of this residue with a methionine in mutant S318G may induce changes that make the transporter interact with purine nucleosides with an increased apparent affinity. However, it should be noted that the proposed topology of N2 consisting of 14 transmembrane domains with an internal C and N termini needs experimental validation. In addition, with the crystal structure of N2 unknown, the possibility that serine 318 may influence the selectivity of N2 through indirect interactions with other sites in the protein cannot be excluded. In summary, we identified a single residue, serine 318, that is primarily responsible for determining the substrate selectivity of the N2 Na+-nucleoside transporter. The data suggest that serine 318 may be located in the nucleoside permeation pathway and act as a gating residue that is important for the pyrimidine selectivity of N2. An adjacent residue, glutamine 319, was found to be important in influencing the apparent affinity of the transporter for purine nucleosides. These studies provide important information about the molecular mechanisms that govern the functional characteristics of Na+-nucleoside transporters. Furthermore, the finding that a few residues along the solute permeation pathway are responsible for the substrate selectivity and affinity of N2 may reflect a common molecular mechanism for substrate discrimination in some membrane transporters."

Transcription of thepotABCD operon was inhibited by PotD, a spermidine-binding protein usually found in the periplasm, and the inhibitory effect of PotD was increased by spermidine. Transcription was not affected by bovine serum albumin, PotA, or PotF, suggesting that the effects of PotD are specific to the PotD protein. In the presence of 8 mm spermidine, a 50% inhibition of transcription was observed with a molar ratio of approximately 1:500 of template DNA:PotD. It was found that PotD bound to regions −258 to −209 nucleotides upstream and +66 to +135 nucleotides downstream of the ATG initiation codon of the potA gene. Binding of PotD to the downstream site was stimulated by spermidine. Overexpression of PotD inEscherichia coli DH5α inhibited the uptake of spermidine, the synthesis of PotABCD mRNA, and expression of alacZ reporter gene fused downstream of a potAgene containing the PotD binding sites. In cells overexpressing PotD, a large amount of PotD existed as PotD precursor in spheroplasts. Our results indicate that PotD precursor can also inhibit spermidine transport. The amino acid residues in PotD that are involved in its interaction with the potABCD operon were determined using mutated PotD proteins. Thr-35 and Ser-85 of PotD were found to be important for this interaction. These results suggest that transcription of the spermidine transport (potABCD) operon is inhibited in vivo by PotD precursor rather than PotD through its binding to two regions close to the transcriptional initiation site of the operon.

Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are known to be necessary for cell growth (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev.

It is thus important to understand the mechanisms by which cellular polyamines are regulated. Polyamine transport is one of the important factors that determines polyamine content. In Escherichia coli, polyamine uptake is energy-dependent, and there are separate uptake systems for putrescine and spermidine (3Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3714-3723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 972-977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

The system encoded by pPT104 is a spermidine uptake system, and that encoded by pPT79 is a putrescine-specific uptake system.

The third system, a putrescine transport system encoded by pPT71, is active in the excretion of putrescine from cells through a putrescine-ornithine antiporter activity (14Kashiwagi K. Suzuki T.

We have shown that the expression of pPT71 is positively regulated at the translational level by RNase III (17Kashiwagi K. Watanabe R. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The RNase increased the translational efficiency of mRNA derived from the E. coli gene by cutting the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA (17Kashiwagi K. Watanabe R. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We also examined whether the spermidine uptake system, encoded by pPT104, is regulated by polyamines and found that uptake of spermidine decreased with an increase in cellular polyamine content. In this communication, we report our study on the mechanism of the decrease in spermidine uptake activity when polyamines accumulate in cells. We found that the PotD protein, a substrate-binding protein of the spermidine uptake system encoded by pPT104, as well as its precursor, inhibit transcription of the pPT104 clone by binding to two regions close to the transcriptional initiation site of the operon. The inhibitory effect of PotD (or PotD precursor) was enhanced by spermidine. Our results strongly suggest that PotD precursor is much more likely to be the primary regulator.DISCUSSIONOur results show that PotD or more likely the PotD precursor functions as a transcriptional regulator of the spermidine uptake operon.

These factors interact with curved DNA (36Owen-Hughes T.A. Pavitt G.D. Santos D.S. Sidebotham J.M. Hulton C.S.J. Hinton J.C.D. Higgins C.F.

In most cases, these factors interact with a region upstream of the initiation codon ATG. An exception is that H-NS recognizes a downstream regulation element existing in the ORF of theproU gene (36Owen-Hughes T.A. Pavitt G.D. Santos D.S. Sidebotham J.M. Hulton C.S.J. Hinton J.C.D. Higgins C.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 255-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The PotD protein recognizes two regions of the spermidine uptake operon–one on the promoter region and the other on the ORF region of the potA gene. However, there is a great difference in the affinity for DNA of H-NS and PotD. H-NS functions at concentrations of 10–100 ng/pmol DNA (36Owen-Hughes T.A. Pavitt G.D. Santos D.S. Sidebotham J.M. Hulton C.S.J. Hinton J.C.D. Higgins C.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 255-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 37Ueguchi C. Kakeda M. Mizuno T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but the PotD functions at concentrations of 10–100 μg/pmol DNA;i.e. PotD (or the PotD precursor) has about a 1000-fold lower affinity for DNA than does H-NS. Intuitively, this is understandable because the major known function of H-NS is as a transcriptional regulator, whereas that of PotD is as a periplasmic polyamine-binding protein. PotD presumably inhibits transcription of the spermidine uptake operon only when excess amounts of PotD are produced. Under these conditions, large amounts of PotD precursor accumulate inside the cells, where it acts as the repressor of the spermidine uptake operon.Because the interaction of PotD with DNA is weak, we could not precisely determine the binding site of PotD on the spermidine uptake operon by using DNase I footprinting analysis. Therefore, we determined the PotD protein binding site on the operon by using gel shift assays and competition experiments with 30-mer oligonucleotides. PotD bound to regions −258 to −209 nucleotide upstream and +66 to +135 nucleotides downstream from the ATG initiation codon of the potA gene. These two PotD binding sites on the spermidine uptake operon could possibly make a palindromic structure. The PotD binding site 1 can make stronger palindrome than the PotD binding site 2. The binding of PotD protein to site 1 was not significantly influenced by spermidine, but binding to site 2 was strengthened by spermidine. Spermidine could conceivably act to strengthen a palindromic structure.Our results indicate that PotD precursor, but not mature PotD, accumulated in the spheroplast when excess amounts of PotD are synthesized. Using E. coli mutant that prevents protein translocation from the cytoplasm to the periplasm, we could show that PotD precursor in the spheroplast reduced the spermidine uptake. Furthermore, PotD precursor inhibited the in vitrotranscription of spermidine uptake operon at almost the same degree as mature PotD. The results strongly suggest that PotD precursor is a primary regulator of the transcription of spermidine uptake operon.To confirm that PotD precursor functions as a regulator of the spermidine uptake operon, the number of PotD precursor in spheroplast was estimated. Since it has been reported that number of RNA polymerase ς70 is constant during the logarithmic phase of cell growth and is estimated to be about 700 molecules/cell (43Jishage M. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6832-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), the number of PotD precursor existed in spheroplast of E. coliDH5α/pUCpotD was estimated by comparison with the number of RNA polymerase ς70 by Western blot analysis. It was about 5 × 103 to 2.5 × 104molecules/cell. Because a 50% inhibition of transcription was observed in an approximate molar ratio of 1:500 of template DNA:PotD, the above values can explain about 70–80% inhibition of spermidine uptake by excess PotD.It is well known that some ribosomal proteins function as translational repressors (44Nomura M. Gourse R. Baughman G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 75-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). It has been reported that PutA protein also functions as membrane-bound dehydrogenase as well as the repressor of the put operon (45Muro-Poster A.M. Maloy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9819-9827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In summary, PotD or more likely the PotD precursor is a new type of transcriptional regulator. Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are known to be necessary for cell growth (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 2Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus important to understand the mechanisms by which cellular polyamines are regulated. Polyamine transport is one of the important factors that determines polyamine content. In Escherichia coli, polyamine uptake is energy-dependent, and there are separate uptake systems for putrescine and spermidine (3Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3714-3723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 972-977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have obtained and characterized three clones for E. coli polyamine transport genes (pPT104, pPT79, and pPT71) (5Kashiwagi K. Hosokawa N. Furuchi T. Kobayashi H. Sasakawa C. Yoshikawa M. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20893-20897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The system encoded by pPT104 is a spermidine uptake system, and that encoded by pPT79 is a putrescine-specific uptake system. The characteristics of these two uptake systems, which belong to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily (6Ames G.F.-L. Annu. Rev.

The third system, a putrescine transport system encoded by pPT71, is active in the excretion of putrescine from cells through a putrescine-ornithine antiporter activity (14Kashiwagi K. Suzuki T.

Recently, we have begun to study regulation of the genes encoding the various polyamine transport systems. We have shown that the expression of pPT71 is positively regulated at the translational level by RNase III (17Kashiwagi K. Watanabe R. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The RNase increased the translational efficiency of mRNA derived from the E. coli gene by cutting the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA (17Kashiwagi K. Watanabe R. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We also examined whether the spermidine uptake system, encoded by pPT104, is regulated by polyamines and found that uptake of spermidine decreased with an increase in cellular polyamine content. In this communication, we report our study on the mechanism of the decrease in spermidine uptake activity when polyamines accumulate in cells. We found that the PotD protein, a substrate-binding protein of the spermidine uptake system encoded by pPT104, as well as its precursor, inhibit transcription of the pPT104 clone by binding to two regions close to the transcriptional initiation site of the operon. The inhibitory effect of PotD (or PotD precursor) was enhanced by spermidine. Our results strongly suggest that PotD precursor is much more likely to be the primary regulator. DISCUSSIONOur results show that PotD or more likely the PotD precursor functions as a transcriptional regulator of the spermidine uptake operon.

These factors interact with curved DNA (36Owen-Hughes T.A. Pavitt G.D. Santos D.S. Sidebotham J.M. Hulton C.S.J. Hinton J.C.D. Higgins C.F.

In most cases, these factors interact with a region upstream of the initiation codon ATG. An exception is that H-NS recognizes a downstream regulation element existing in the ORF of theproU gene (36Owen-Hughes T.A. Pavitt G.D. Santos D.S. Sidebotham J.M. Hulton C.S.J. Hinton J.C.D. Higgins C.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 255-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The PotD protein recognizes two regions of the spermidine uptake operon–one on the promoter region and the other on the ORF region of the potA gene. However, there is a great difference in the affinity for DNA of H-NS and PotD. H-NS functions at concentrations of 10–100 ng/pmol DNA (36Owen-Hughes T.A. Pavitt G.D. Santos D.S. Sidebotham J.M.

Intuitively, this is understandable because the major known function of H-NS is as a transcriptional regulator, whereas that of PotD is as a periplasmic polyamine-binding protein. PotD presumably inhibits transcription of the spermidine uptake operon only when excess amounts of PotD are produced. Under these conditions, large amounts of PotD precursor accumulate inside the cells, where it acts as the repressor of the spermidine uptake operon.Because the interaction of PotD with DNA is weak, we could not precisely determine the binding site of PotD on the spermidine uptake operon by using DNase I footprinting analysis. Therefore, we determined the PotD protein binding site on the operon by using gel shift assays and competition experiments with 30-mer oligonucleotides. PotD bound to regions −258 to −209 nucleotide upstream and +66 to +135 nucleotides downstream from the ATG initiation codon of the potA gene.

https://openalex.org/W2080292060,"A bifunctional enzyme, fructose-6-phosphate,2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase (Fru-6-P,2-kinase/Fru-2,6-Pase), catalyzes synthesis and degradation of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2). Previously, the rat liver Fru-2,6-Pase reaction (Fru-2,6-P2 → Fru-6-P + Pi) has been shown to proceed via a phosphoenzyme intermediate with His258 phosphorylated, and mutation of the histidine to alanine resulted in complete loss of activity (Tauler, A., Lin, K., and Pilkis, S. J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 15617–15622). In the present study, it is shown that mutation of the corresponding histidine (His256) of the rat testis enzyme decreases activity by less than a factor of 10 with ak cat of 17% compared with the wild type enzyme. Mutation of His390 (in close proximity to His256) to Ala results in a k cat of 12.5% compared with the wild type enzyme. Attempts to detect a phosphohistidine intermediate with the H256A mutant enzyme were unsuccessful, but the phosphoenzyme is detected in the wild type, H390A, R255A, R305S, and E325A mutant enzymes. Data demonstrate that the mutation of His256 induces a change in the phosphatase hydrolytic reaction mechanism. Elimination of the nucleophilic catalyst, H256A, results in a change in mechanism. In the H256A mutant enzyme, His390 likely acts as a general base to activate water for direct hydrolysis of the 2-phosphate of Fru-2,6-P2. Mutation of Arg255 and Arg305 suggests that the arginines probably have a role in neutralizing excess charge on the 2-phosphate and polarizing the phosphoryl for subsequent transfer to either His256 or water. The role of Glu325 is less certain, but it may serve as a general acid, protonating the leaving 2-hydroxyl of Fru-2,6-P2.

A bifunctional enzyme, Fru-6-P,2-kinase1/Fru-2,6-Pase catalyzes the synthesis and degradation of Fru-2,6-P2, the most potent activator of phosphofructokinase known (1Uyeda K. Kurby S.A. Enzyme Catalysis. II. CRC Press, Inc., Boston1991: 445-456Google Scholar). The rat testis enzyme is a homodimer with a subunit M r of 55,000. The enzyme consists of two distinct catalytic domains, a Fru-6-P,2-kinase domain in the N-terminal half and a Fru-2,6-Pase domain in the C-terminal half. The crystal structure of the enzyme has recently been determined (2Hasemann C.A. Istavan E.S. Uyeda K. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1996; 4: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and it indicates the kinase domain is structurally similar to nucleoside monophosphate kinases and to the catalytic core of the GTP-binding proteins. The crystal structure (2Hasemann C.A. Istavan E.S. Uyeda K. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1996; 4: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), as well as sequence similarities of a peptide surrounding an active site histidine, shows that the phosphatase domain belongs to the phosphoglycerate mutase family. Residue His8 in the yeast phosphoglycerate mutase has been shown to be phosphorylated during catalysis (3Han C.-H. Rose Z.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8836-8840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the homologous His258 of the rat liver Fru-2,6-Pase has been shown to be phosphorylated during the hydrolysis of Fru-2,6-P2 (4Pilkis S.J. Lively M.O. El-Maghrabi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12672-12675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the idea that a histidine residue is central to the catalytic mechanism of Fru-2,6-Pase is the observation that mutation of His258 of the rat liver enzyme results in complete loss of the hydrolytic activity (5Tauler A. Lin K. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15617-15622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the rate of formation of the phosphorylenzyme has been shown to be faster than the overall phosphatase activity, supporting a phosphoenzyme intermediate (6Stewart H.B. El-Magfrabi M.R.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6010-6019Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), have demonstrated that in addition to His256(corresponding to His258 of the liver isozyme), Arg255, Glu325, Arg305, and His390 (corresponding to Arg257, Glu327, Arg307, and His392, respectively, of the liver isozyme) are also located in the active site of the Fru-2,6-Pase (Fig. 1). A role for the conserved residues in catalysis has been proposed. Residue His392 (corresponding to His390 of the testis enzyme) has been suggested to act as a proton donor (5Tauler A. Lin K. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15617-15622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Arg257 and Arg307 (corresponding to Arg255 and Arg305, respectively, of the testis enzyme) are proposed to interact with the reactive C-2 phospho group of Fru-2,6-P2 and are proposed to stabilize the phospho group in the ground (Arg257) and transition states (Arg307) (8Lin K. Li L. Correia J.J. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19163-19171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residue Glu327 (corresponding to Glu325 of the testis enzyme) is thought to maintain His392 in the protonated state (9Lin K. Li L. Correia J.J. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6556-6562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the course of preparation of a mutant testis enzyme in which His256 (corresponding to His258 of the liver enzyme) was substituted with Ala (which, by analogy to the liver enzyme, should have eliminated Fru-2,6-Pase activity (5Tauler A. Lin K. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15617-15622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), we found that the H256A mutant enzyme retained the hydrolytic activity. The objectives of this investigation are to obtain an explanation for the Fru-2,6-Pase activity of the mutant enzyme and to re-evaluate the significance of the phosphoryl-His256 as a reaction intermediate. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The cDNA encoding rat testis Fru-6-P,2-kinase/Fru-2,6-Pase (RT2K) was prepared as reported previously (10Sakata J. Abe Y. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15764-15770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the Trp-less mutant (RT2K-Wo), in which all four Trp residues of RT2K have been altered to Phe by site-directed mutagenesis was prepared as described previously (11Watanabe F. Jameson D.M. Uyeda K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 904-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The pT7-7 RNA polymerase/promoter plasmid (12Tabor S. Richardson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar) was a gift from S. Tabor (Harvard Medical School). Restriction enzymes and T4 polynucleotide kinase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The DNA ligation kit was from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan). The Muta-Gene M13 in vitro mutagenesis kit was from Bio-Rad. The Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit was from U.S. Biochemical Corp. [2-32P]Fru-2,6-P2 was prepared as described previously (13Sakakibara R. Kato M. Okamura N. Nakagawa T. Koyama Y. Tominaga N. Shimojo M. Fukasawa M. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) using pure rat testis Fru-6-P,2-kinase/Fru-2,6-Pase. All other chemicals were of reagent grade and obtained from commercial sources. Fru-2,6-Pase activity was assayed using two methods. This assay measures the formation of Fru-6-P fluorometrically coupled to NADPH formation using phosphoglucose isomerase and Glu-6-P dehydrogenase as described previously (14Tominaga N. Minami Y. Sakakibara R. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15951-15957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture in a final volume of 1 ml contained 100 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 μm NADP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 unit of Glu 6-P dehydrogenase, 1 unit of phosphoglucose isomerase, and the indicated amounts of Fru-2,6-P2. The reaction was initiated with addition of enzyme and followed at 25 °C by measuring NADPH formation continuously at 452-nm emission and excitation at 350 nm using a Ratio-2 fluorometer (Optical Technology Devices Co.). This assay measures the release of 32Pi from [2-32P]Fru-2,6-P2. The reaction mixture in a final volume of 0.1 ml contained 100 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 μm NADP, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 0.4 unit of Glu-6-P dehydrogenase, 1 unit of phosphoglucose isomerase, and the indicated amount of [2-32P]Fru-2,6-P2. As found earlier (15Kitajima S. Sakakibara R. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6896-6903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Fru-6-P-depleting system using the coupled enzymes was necessary, since Fru-6-P is a potent inhibitor of Fru-2,6-Pase. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of 1 n NaOH, and the solution was heated at 85 °C for 90 s. Water (1 ml) was added to the heated reaction mixture, and the sample was applied to a Dowex 1-Cl−column (0.5 × 2 cm), which had been equilibrated with 20 mm NH4OH. The column was washed with 5 ml of 20 mm NH4OH, and 32Pi was then eluted with 5 ml of 20 mm NH4OH containing 0.15 m NaCl. The eluate was diluted with 15 ml of scintillation mixture and counted in a scintillation counter. The assay was based on the determination of the amount of Fru-2,6-P2 produced and is the same as that described previously (16Furuya E. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7109-7112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification. The reaction mixture in a final volume of 50 μl contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA and the indicated concentrations of Fru-6-P, MgCl2, and ATP. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. After the incubation, the reaction was terminated by adding 50 μl of 0.1 n NaOH, and the mixture was incubated at 85 °C for 90 s. Suitable aliquots were assayed for Fru-2,6-P2 as described by Uyeda et al. (17Uyeda K. Furuya E. Luby L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8394-8399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of Fru-2,6-P2 per min under these conditions. Oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis was performed as described by Kunkel (18Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar), using the Muta-Gene M13 in vitro mutagenesis kit. Plasmid RT2K-Wo/pT7-7 containing the RT2K-Wo gene, cloned in a pT7-7 vector (11Watanabe F. Jameson D.M. Uyeda K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 904-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was digested withXbaI and HindIII, and the isolated 1.7-kilobase pair fragment containing the RT2K-Wo gene was ligated into theXbaI–HindIII site of M13mp18 (M13/RT2K-Wo). The phage harboring M13/RT2K-Wo was transfected into Escherichia coli CJ236 (dut − ,ung −). The recombinant M13/RT2K-Wo phage was purified and used to prepare uracil-containing single-stranded template. Synthetic oligonucleotide primers used for constructing various mutants are listed in TableI. The synthesized double-stranded DNA was used to transform E. coli MV1190. Mutant derivatives were checked by DNA sequencing (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52746) Google Scholar). The mutant DNAs were digested withNdeI and HindIII, and the DNA fragments containing a mutated RT2K-Wo gene were subcloned into theNdeI–HindIII site of pT7–7 (RT2K-Wo/pT7–7). H256A/R305S, H256A/E325A, and H256A/H390D double mutant plasmids were constructed using the same method as that used for making single mutants with the exception of using a uracil-containing single-stranded template prepared from the H256A mutant plasmid instead of the RT2K-Wo plasmid DNA.Table IOligonucleotide sequencesMutantsOligonucleotide sequenceR255A5′-CTC CCC GTG CGC GCA GAG GTA G-3′H256A5′-C ACT CTC CCC GGC CCG GCA GAG-3′R305S5′-CTG GAT CGTGCT CTT CAT CTG G-3′E325A5′-GC GTC AAT CGC GTT GAG GAC C-3′H390A5′-CAC AGC CTG GGC GCA AAT GAC-3′The mutated nucleotides are underlined.

Open table in a new tab The mutated nucleotides are underlined. These oligonucleotides are the complementary DNA of the wild type RT2K at positions 790–811 (R255A), 794–815 (H256A), 940–961 (R305S), 1000–1020 (E325A), and 1196–1216 (H390A). The obtained expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3), and recombinant mutant enzymes were purified using the same procedure as that for the wild type enzyme (14Tominaga N. Minami Y. Sakakibara R. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15951-15957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All the enzymes were purified to apparent homogeneity as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Before assay, all enzymes were desalted by column centrifugation (20Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 50 mm Tris-phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% polyethylene glycol (M r = 300), and 5% glycerol. Previously, El-Maghrabi et al. (21El-Maghrabi M.R. Correia J.J. Heil P.J. Pate T.M. Cobb C.E. Pilkis S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5005-5009Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) used phosphocellulose under acidic conditions to isolate the phosphoenzyme intermediate. Using the phosphocellulose method, recovery of the phosphoryl-His intermediate is less than 50%. Consequently, we have employed the following alkaline method developed by Wei and Matthew (22Wei Y.-F. Matthews R.H. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using Nytran filters resulting in quantitative recovery. Nytran filters (Schleicher & Schuell) were pretreated with 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate, pH 10, for 1 h at 4 °C to reduce the background and then air-dried. At given time intervals, aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture, and the reaction was terminated by adding 110 volume of 1 n NaOH. A portion of the aliquot was transferred onto the air-dried Nytran filters, and the filters were washed with 10 mm cold sodium pyrophosphate, pH 10, for 10 min (200 ml, three times). After washing, the filters were air-dried and subjected to scintillation counting. The enzyme was desalted by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and a 2–4-μg sample was introduced into a VG30250 quadruple mass spectrometer (Micromass Inc., Altrinckam, United Kingdom) and ionized by electrospray. The mass analyzer was scanned over the m/z range of 600–1600, and the data were transformed automatically using the manufacturer's LAB-BASE protocol. All 31P NMR spectra were recorded using a Varian 500-MHz NMR spectrometer operating at 202.46 MHz for 31P. All spectra were collected using 5-mm quartz NMR tubes with a 2.5-s acquisition time, a 45° pulse, and broad band proton decoupling (2.5–3.5 watts). All 31P chemical shifts are referenced to 85% H3PO4 at 0.00 ppm. A small amount of D2O (10%, v/v) was added to the reaction mixture and served as a field/frequency lock. In all cases, about 1000–3000 scans were accumulated. An exponential line broadening of 10 Hz was applied prior to Fourier transformation. Positive chemical shifts are downfield from the reference 85% H3PO4. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to the procedure of Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar), using the Phast system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). In this study, a mutant enzyme termed Wo has been used in which all four Trp have been substituted with Phe because of its high expression compared with the wild enzyme in E. coli. The W → F mutations did not alter kinetic properties of either Fru-6-P,2-kinase or Fru-2,6-Pase activities significantly (11Watanabe F. Jameson D.M. Uyeda K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 904-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, a pure H256A enzyme was found to have Fru-2,6-Pase activity. In order to rule out the possibility that the preparation of the mutant enzyme was contaminated with a trace amount of the wild type enzyme (in this study, Wo), the masses of both the Wo and H256A mutant enzymes were determined using a mass spectrometer. Results showed that both enzymes have two components; the major protein (over 90%) in the samples is the expected enzyme, but a minor protein (less than 10%) exhibited a slightly higher mass. The minor protein in the Wo and H256A gave M r values of 53,924 and 53,850, respectively. The minor protein in the H256A sample is not likely the Wo enzyme, since its M r is much lower than that of the Wo enzyme (M r = 53,872). The kinetic parameters of Fru-6-P,2-kinase activity of various single and double mutants used in this study were not significantly changed (TableII). TableIII provides a summary of the kinetic parameters for the Fru-2,6-Pase activity of the Wo and the mutant enzymes. The H256A mutant enzyme exhibits a k catof 5.5 × 10−3 s−1 for Fru-2,6-Pase (17% of Wo enzyme activity), whilek cat/ KFru2,6-P2decreases by almost an order of magnitude. Previously, Tauler et al. (5Tauler A. Lin K. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15617-15622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the H258A (corresponding to H256A of the testis enzyme) mutant of the rat liver bifunctional enzyme has no Fru-2,6-Pase activity. It is unlikely that this discrepancy is due to the difference in the isozymic forms, since the three-dimensional structures of the Fru-2,6-Pase active sites for these isozymes are identical (2Hasemann C.A. Istavan E.S. Uyeda K. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1996; 4: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Lee Y.-H. Ogata C. Pflugrath J.W. Levitt D.G. Sarma R. Banaszak L.J. Pilkis S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6010-6019Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The other histidine (His390) thought to act as a catalytic group, gives a similar residualk cat (12% compared with Wo) andk cat/K m (decreased by 2 orders of magnitude compared with Wo) when changed to alanine, while the H390D mutant enzyme exhibits no detectable activity at an enzyme concentration more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than that used for Wo (data not shown). Double mutants in which both histidines are changed to alanine have very little residual activity. The H256A/H390A mutant exhibits an activity 106-fold lower than Wo, while the H256A/H390D mutant exhibits no detectable activity at a 30-fold higher concentration than that used for Wo (data not shown).Table IIKinetic parameters for the Fru-6-P,2-kinase activity of Wo and mutant enzymesEnzymesK Fru-6-PK ATPk catk cat/K Fru-6-Pk cat/K ATPmmmms−1m−1s−1m−1 s−1Wo0.0770.110.076990690R255A0.120.140.062520440H256A0.0310.0560.0521700930R305S0.10.240.111100460E325A0.0660.150.050760330H390A0.100.120.094940780H256A/R305S0.150.110.069460630H256A/E325A0.0600.120.0701200580Fru-6-P,2-kinase activities were assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using 0.25 μg of enzyme.

Fru-2,6-Pase activity was assayed as discussed under “Experimental Procedures” using 5 μg of enzyme. The range of substrate concentrations used was 0.02–10 μm. S.E. values were ±10%. Three other positions (Arg255, Arg305, and Glu325) have been changed either singly or in combination with the putative active site nucleophile, His256. Of the other mutants tested, the R255A gives a k cat10% and ak cat/ KFru2,6-P270-fold lower than the corresponding values of Wo. Thek cat values of the R305S and E325A mutant enzymes are 10- and 50-fold lower than those measured for Wo, while values for the H256A/R305S and H256A/E325A double mutants are decreased 60- and 500-fold, respectively. Interestingly, mutation of either Arg305 or His256 gives a multiplicative effect and 10-fold decrease for R305S. A 60-fold decrease for the H256A/R305S double mutant is more than additive of 6-fold decrease for H256A and a 10-fold decrease for R305S. A much more substantial effect is observed for the H256A/E325A double mutant, suggesting a more important role for Glu325 than for Arg305. In order to rule out a possibility that the observed Fru-2,6-P2 hydrolytic activity is due to the reverse reaction of Fru-6-P,2-kinase in the absence of MgADP, the effect of MgADP on the Fru-2,6-Pase activity of Wo and H256A mutant enzyme was investigated using assay B (Pi formation). If the hydrolysis of Fru-2,6-P2 were catalyzed by the kinase, one would expect that a saturating concentration of MgADP would inhibit Pi formation by the reverse of the kinase reaction and that the inhibition should not be affected by mutation of His256. As shown in Table IV, no inhibition of the phosphatase activity was observed for either Wo or the H256A mutant enzymes using up to 1 mm MgADP. The range of MgADP concentrations used was saturating, since theK ADP for the kinase in the reverse reaction has been reported as 62 μm (15Kitajima S. Sakakibara R. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6896-6903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the concentrations of Fru-2,6-P2 used were subsaturating for the reverse reaction ( KFru2,6-P2 = 8 μm; Ref. 15Kitajima S. Sakakibara R. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6896-6903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but near the K m for the Fru-2,6-Pase reaction. Under these conditions, the rate of the reverse reaction should be much slower than that of the phosphatase reaction. Nevertheless, Fru-2,6-P2 hydrolytic activity observed with the H256A mutant enzyme was unchanged. These results are consistent with the Fru-2,6-Pase activity of H256A arising from the phosphatase and not the kinase active site.Table IVEffect of MgADP on Fru 2,6-Pase activityADPWoChangeH256AChangemmmilliunits/mg%milliunits/mg%06.51003.71000.257.51154.41190.58.51313.810318.41293.8103Assay B (Pi formation) was used. Enzyme (10 ng of Wo or 100 ng of H256A) was incubated with 0.08 μm (8600 cpm/pmol for Wo) or 1 μm (950 cpm/pmol for H256A) of [2-32P]Fru-2,6-P2 in the presence of the above concentrations of ADP. The concentration of MgCl2 was 2 mm. The S.E. values were ±15%. Open table in a new tab Assay B (Pi formation) was used. Enzyme (10 ng of Wo or 100 ng of H256A) was incubated with 0.08 μm (8600 cpm/pmol for Wo) or 1 μm (950 cpm/pmol for H256A) of [2-32P]Fru-2,6-P2 in the presence of the above concentrations of ADP. The concentration of MgCl2 was 2 mm. The S.E. values were ±15%. It is known that Fru-6-P and Pi are noncompetitive and competitive inhibitors, respectively, of the Fru-2,6-Pase activity (15Kitajima S. Sakakibara R. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6896-6903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with SchemeFSI. The possibility that the Fru-6-P or Pi inhibition pattern might be altered by the mutation was investigated. Inhibition of the H256A mutant enzyme by Fru-6-P gives a noncompetitive inhibition pattern (Fig. 2 A(top)), qualitatively identical to that observed for Wo. However, an estimated K i value of 86 μm is measured for H256A compared with the value of 51 nm obtained for Wo (Fig. 2 B), indicating a 1000-fold decrease in affinity for Fru-6-P resulting from the mutation. As shown in Fig. 2 (bottom), Pi is a competitive inhibitor for both Wo and the H256A mutant enzyme, with theK i values of 0.74 and 0.22 mm, respectively. Thus, very little difference in affinity for phosphate is observed as a result of the H256A mutation. Fig.3 shows time courses for Fru-6-P production as a function of the concentration of Wo and the H256A and H390A mutant enzymes. The formation of Fru-6-P was monitored continuously using the coupled fluorimetric assay (assay A). Production of Fru-6-P in the reactions catalyzed by both Wo and the H256A mutant enzyme is linear at all enzyme concentrations, Fig. 3 A. On the other hand, the time course for Fru-6-P formation catalyzed by H390A is biphasic with a rapid initial burst of 5-min duration, followed by a slow linear rate. The initial rate of the burst phase of the H390A mutant is approximately 14 milliunits/mg, and the extent of the initial reaction is proportional to enzyme concentration. The time courses for Pi formation catalyzed by the above enzymes were determined by measuring the 32Piproduced from [2-32P]Fru-2,6-P2 (assay B), while following the formation of Fru-6-P simultaneously using the fluorometric assay, so that the formation of both products could be determined in the same reaction mixture. The results (Fig.3 B) exhibit a linear production of Pi for Wo and the H256A mutant enzyme with rates of 42 and 7 milliunits/mg, respectively; identical rates were measured for Fru-6-P. The rate of Pi formation by H390A is linear with a calculated rate of 3.6 milliunits/mg, in contrast to the biphasic curve for Fru-6-P format"
https://openalex.org/W2005548162,"The microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is required for the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. To investigate the role of MTP in lipoprotein assembly, we determined the ability of carboxyl-terminally truncated forms of apoB to be secreted from cells treated with the MTP inhibitor 4′-bromo-3′-methylmetaqualone (Benoist, F., Nicodeme, E., and Grand-Perret, T. (1996) Eur. J. Biochem. 240, 713–720). In Caco-2 and mhAT3F cells that produce apoB100 and apoB48, the inhibitor preferentially blocked apoB100 secretion. When the inhibitor was tested on McA-RH7777 cells stably transfected with cDNAs encoding human apoB100, apoB72, apoB53, apoB29, and apoB18, the secretion of apoB100, apoB72, and apoB53 was preferentially impaired relative to apoB48 and shorter forms. To delineate the region between apoB48 and apoB53 that has a high requirement for MTP, we used puromycin to generate a range of truncated forms of apoB in HepG2 cells. The secretion of apoB53 and longer forms of apoB was markedly affected by low concentrations of the MTP inhibitor (∼ 1 μm), whereas apoB51 and smaller forms of apoB were only affected at higher concentrations (> 10 μm). The size-related sensitivity to MTP inhibitor was not due to late processing or retention, since the same result was observed when nascent lipoproteins were isolated from the endoplasmic reticulum. The MTP inhibitor did not alter the density of the secreted lipoproteins, indicating that each apoB polypeptide requires a minimally defined amount of lipid to attain a secretable conformation. Our results suggest that the folding of the domain between apoB51 and apoB53 has a high requirement for lipid. This domain is predicted to form amphipathic α-helices and to bind lipid reversibly. It proceeds and is followed by rigid amphipathic β-sheets that are predicted to associate with lipid irreversibly. We speculate that these domains enable apoB to switch from a stable lipid-poor conformation in apoB48 to another lipid-rich conformation in apoB100 during lipoprotein assembly. The microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is required for the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. To investigate the role of MTP in lipoprotein assembly, we determined the ability of carboxyl-terminally truncated forms of apoB to be secreted from cells treated with the MTP inhibitor 4′-bromo-3′-methylmetaqualone (Benoist, F., Nicodeme, E., and Grand-Perret, T. (1996) Eur. J. Biochem. 240, 713–720). In Caco-2 and mhAT3F cells that produce apoB100 and apoB48, the inhibitor preferentially blocked apoB100 secretion. When the inhibitor was tested on McA-RH7777 cells stably transfected with cDNAs encoding human apoB100, apoB72, apoB53, apoB29, and apoB18, the secretion of apoB100, apoB72, and apoB53 was preferentially impaired relative to apoB48 and shorter forms. To delineate the region between apoB48 and apoB53 that has a high requirement for MTP, we used puromycin to generate a range of truncated forms of apoB in HepG2 cells. The secretion of apoB53 and longer forms of apoB was markedly affected by low concentrations of the MTP inhibitor (∼ 1 μm), whereas apoB51 and smaller forms of apoB were only affected at higher concentrations (> 10 μm). The size-related sensitivity to MTP inhibitor was not due to late processing or retention, since the same result was observed when nascent lipoproteins were isolated from the endoplasmic reticulum. The MTP inhibitor did not alter the density of the secreted lipoproteins, indicating that each apoB polypeptide requires a minimally defined amount of lipid to attain a secretable conformation.

We speculate that these domains enable apoB to switch from a stable lipid-poor conformation in apoB48 to another lipid-rich conformation in apoB100 during lipoprotein assembly. apolipoprotein microsomal triglyceride transfer protein endoplasmic reticulum polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Apolipoprotein B (apoB)1mediates the formation of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins in the liver and intestine. In humans, the liver secretes a large form of 4536 residues called apoB100, whereas the intestine secretes apoB48 corresponding to the 48% amino-terminal part of apoB100 (reviewed in Ref. 1Chan L. J.

The two forms derive from the same gene by the process of site-specific cytidine deamination of nucleotide 6666 of apoB100 mRNA (2Navaratnam N. Morrison J.R. Bhattacharya S. Patel D. Funahashi T.

The lipid:protein ratio and the size of the lipoprotein are reduced according to the size of apoB truncated forms, leading to hypolipidemia. This suggests that the length of apoB determines the amount of lipid that can assemble into a lipoprotein particle. The intracellular assembly of apoB with lipid in hepatocytes and enterocytes absolutely requires a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) complex (8Leiper J.M. Bayliss J.D. Pease R.J.

Carboxyl-terminally truncated forms of apoB longer than apoB23 are only secreted as lipoprotein particles, whereas smaller forms of apoB are secreted with little or no associated lipid and do not require MTP to attain a secretion-competent conformation (8Leiper J.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14124-14133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The mechanism of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein assembly is not a simple size-related lipidation of apoB. ApoB48 has been demonstrated to be lipidated through two discrete steps in rat liver cells (16Swift L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Boren J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second lipidation step of apoB48 is not governed by the size of the apoB polypeptide but seems to be triggered by short hydrophobic sequences within apoB48 (18Mc Leod R.S. Wang Y. Wang S. Rusinol A. Links P. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18445-18455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This could explain why intestinal chylomicrons are more lipid-rich than hepatic very low density lipoproteins despite the fact that they contain apoB48 rather than apoB100. Whether or not the second lipidation step requires MTP activity is still under debate (19Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Gregg R.E. Olofsson S.O. Boren J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33047-33053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Partial inhibition of MTP has been reported to affect the secretion of apoB100 but not of apoB48 from intestinal Caco-2 cells (21Haghpassand M. Wilder D. Moberly J.B. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1468-1480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Van Greevenbroek M.M.J. Robertus-Teunissen M.G. Erkelens W.D. De Bruin T.W.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the data of Jamilet al. (23Jamil H. Chu C.-H. Dickson J.K. Chen Y. Yan M. Biller S.A. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. Gordon D.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1448-1454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that the secretion of apoB48 and apoB100 from McRH7777 is similarly impaired. Little is known about amino acid sequences within apoB100 that are involved in the lipoprotein assembly process. Using computer modeling, Segrest et al. (24Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Garber D.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1674-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) have suggested that apoB100 is composed of a pentapartite structure of three α-helixes alternated with two β-sheets involved in lipid binding. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the obligatory role of MTP for the assembly and secretion of very low density lipoproteins is related to a defined domain of apoB100. To assess this, we compared the secretion from various cells of a series of carboxyl-terminally truncated forms of apoB100 in the presence of up to 40 μm of a specific MTP inhibitor (25Benoist F. Nicodeme E. Grand-Perret T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We were able to localize a structural domain within apoB100 that confers a high requirement for MTP activity, suggesting that this particular domain plays a key role in the lipoprotein assembly process. l-[35S]Methionine (RedivueTM, 37 TBq/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Culture media, additives and fetal calf serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The MTP inhibitor 4′-bromo-3′-methylmetaqualone was synthesized by GlaxoWellcome. Molecular weight markers for electrophoresis were RainbowTM(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All other chemicals were from Sigma. HepG2 and Caco-2 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The MhAT3F mouse hepatocyte-like cell line, derived from mice transgenic for SV40 genes under the antithrombin III promoter, was provided by B. Antoine (26Antoine B. Levrat F. Vallet V. Berbar T. Cartier N. Dubois N. Briand P. Kahn A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). McA-RH7777 stably transfected with human apoB truncated variants were maintained in culture as described previously (27Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. Linton M.F. Taylor S.M. Youg S.G. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3300-3308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28McLeod R.S. Zhao Y. Selby S.L. Westerlund J. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2852-2862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded into 24-well plates (200,000 cells/1.7 cm2) containing basal Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin (100 units/ml each) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in a humidified incubator (5% CO2) at 37 °C. All cells were used after 4 days of culture, except for Caco-2 cells, which were used after 10 days of culture to allow partial differentiation. To avoid problems of fatty acid availability (29Gibbons G.F. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), all experiments were performed in the presence of oleic acid (0.5 mm) complexed to albumin prepared as described previously (25Benoist F. Nicodeme E. Grand-Perret T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The MTP inhibitor was dissolved in Me2SO/ethanol (1:9, v/v) at 4 mm and diluted in ethanol down to 0.01 mm before the addition to the culture medium. Cells were incubated for 30 min in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium before the pulse labeling withl-[35S]methionine (0.4–2 MBq/well, 15–30 min of pulse). The chase was performed by replacement of the medium with RPMI 1640 medium. In experiments using mhAT3F or Caco-2 cells, the chase duration was 2 h. For HepG2 cells, apoB truncated forms were generated by performing a 150-min chase in the presence of 10 μm cycloheximide and 150 μm of puromycin as described by Boren et al. (30Boren J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stably transfected McA-RH7777 cells expressing human truncated apoB forms were labeled for 4 h. Secreted apoB forms were quantified by immunoprecipitation from culture medium after the addition of 1 ml of 60 mm Tris buffer, pH 7, 2 mm ETDA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 m NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 36 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 50 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride. Immunoprecipitations were performed using goat anti-human apoB antiserum (Sigma catalog no. 357-25) after preclearing with gelatin-agarose beads and protein G-Sepharose beads. The gelatin-agarose beads were added to remove soluble fibronectin. This was important, since fibronectin could be easily precipitated and has an apparent molecular mass of 250 kDa. In some experiments, apoAI was immunoprecipitated by using sheep polyclonal antibodies (Boehringer Mannheim catalog no. 726478). All of the samples were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) on a 5–12% acrylamide sigmoid gradient gel under reducing conditions. After drying the gel, the radioactivity was detected using a PhosphorImagerTM screen (Molecular Dynamics). All pulse-chase experiments were reproduced at least three times. In some experiments, lipoproteins were analyzed by sequential ultracentrifugation. The density was adjusted to 1.040 by the addition of KBr. After 2 h of ultracentrifugation at 120,000 rpm in Beckman TLA 120.2 rotor (480,000 × g), the top fraction was collected for immunoprecipitation, whereas the bottom fraction was readjusted to 1.070 before another ultracentrifugation step. The density was thus successively adjusted to 1.040, 1.070, 1.110, and 1.21, and the four lipoprotein fractions plus the protein fraction (bottom of 1.21 ultracentrifugation) were analyzed by immunoprecipitation as before. In some experiments, lipoproteins present in the lumen of the ER were extracted using NaCO3. HepG2 cells were incubated for 30 min in the presence of oleic acid (0.5 mm) before the pulse labeling with l-[35S]methionine (2 MBq/well, 10 min of pulse). ApoB truncated forms were generated by performing a 10-min chase in the presence of 10 μm cycloheximide and 150 μm of puromycin as before. Cells were washed and incubated for 30 min on ice with 200 mm of NaCO3 and a protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM; Boehringer Mannheim). After 30 min of ultracentrifugation at 100,000 rpm in Beckman TLA 120.2 rotor (330,000 × g), the supernatant containing the free lipoproteins was used either for immunoprecipitation or density determination as described above. We have previously shown that the MTP inhibitor 4′-bromo-3′-methylmetaqualone decreases apoB100 secretion by human hepatic cells either in primary culture or in the HepG2 cell line (25Benoist F. Nicodeme E. Grand-Perret T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To determine whether or not the secretion of apoB48 was also affected by an MTP inhibitor, we used cells that naturally produce simultaneously apoB100 and apoB48 due to partial mRNA editing. MhAT3F is a well differentiated mouse hepatocyte-like cell line (26Antoine B. Levrat F. Vallet V. Berbar T. Cartier N. Dubois N. Briand P. Kahn A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,32Levrat F. Vallet V. Berbar T. Miquerol L. Kahn A. Antoine B. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that has a protein secretion profile very similar to primary hepatocytes. Cells were pretreated for 15 min with the MTP inhibitor prior to pulse labeling withl-[35S]methionine for 30 min. After a 120-min chase, secreted apoB were immunoprecipitated. As shown in Fig.1, apoB100 secretion by mhAT3F cells was inhibited by submicromolar concentrations of MTP inhibitor, whereas apoB48 required higher MTP inhibitor concentrations to be affected. At a 1.5 μm concentration of the MTP inhibitor, apoB100 secretion was almost abolished (18% of control), whereas apoB48 secretion was marginally affected (71% of control). Albumin secretion remained insensitive to the compound, thus confirming the lack of toxicity of the MTP inhibitor. The Caco-2 cell line derives from a human intestinal tumor and produces both apoB forms because of partial differentiation (33Mehran M. Levy E. Bendayan M. Seidman E. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 1997; 33: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Caco-2 cells were treated and labeled as mhAT3F. Although the ratio of apoB100versus apoB48 was higher in Caco-2 cells compared with mhAT3F cells (5 and 0.2, respectively), the same type of selectivity for apoB100 was observed upon treatment with the MTP inhibitor. At 10 μm, apoB100 secretion was reduced to 21% of control, whereas apoB48 secretion was similar to control (82%). Such a selectivity suggests that the requirement for MTP-mediated lipid assembly is not the same for apoB100 and apoB48 in two cell lines from different species (mouse or human) and tissues (liver or intestine). Furthermore, the relative sensitivity of both apoB forms toward MTP inhibition is not correlated with the proportion of apoB100versus apoB48 secreted by cells. These results confirm that the observed selectivity to MTP inhibition is due to different intrinsic properties of apoB100 and apoB48. To confirm the result that the MTP inhibitor is more deleterious for the assembly and secretion of apoB100-containing lipoproteins than for apoB48 lipoproteins, we examined the effect of the MTP inhibitor on the secretion of a series of carboxyl-terminally truncated forms of human apoB (apoB18, apoB29, apoB53, apoB72, and apoB100) from stably transfected rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cell lines (27Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. Linton M.F. Taylor S.M. Youg S.G. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3300-3308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28McLeod R.S. Zhao Y. Selby S.L. Westerlund J. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2852-2862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The secretion experiments were performed in the presence of oleic acid (0.5 mm) to avoid possible lipid deficiency due to apoB overexpression. Cells transfected with full-length human apoB100 secrete simultaneously apoB100 and apoB48. These cells were compared with cells expressing human apoB72, apoB53, apoB29, or apoB18. Cells were labeled with l-[35S]methionine for 4 h in the presence of the MTP inhibitor (10 μm). This compound dramatically decreased the secretion of apoB100, apoB72, and apoB53 (less than 20% of control) but had no effect on the secretion of apoB48, apoB29, and apoB18 (Fig.2 A). As shown in Fig.2 B, the dose response to the MTP inhibitor confirmed that apoB truncated forms can be distinguished in two groups: forms resistant to and forms sensitive to MTP inhibition. The transition between the two groups can be localized roughly between apoB48 and apoB53. We have previously demonstrated the correlation between the concentration of this MTP inhibitor and the extent of the inhibition of MTP-mediated lipid transfer activity both in vitro and in cells (25Benoist F. Nicodeme E. Grand-Perret T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To delineate more precisely the relationship between apoB size, MTP activity, and apoB secretion, we evaluated the ability of a large series of carboxyl-terminally truncated forms of apoB100 to be secreted by HepG2 cells. To this end, we used the method described by Borenet al. (30Boren J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This method takes advantage of the capacity of puromycin to induce premature termination of polypeptide elongation (34Janero D.R. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14496-14504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and allows simultaneous expression of a wide range of apoB truncated forms. As shown in Fig. 3(lane a), HepG2 cells pulse-labeled withl-[35S]methionine for 15 min and chased for 150 min secreted only full-length apoB100. By contrast, if the chase was performed in the presence of puromycin and cycloheximide, several apoB truncated forms were secreted (Fig. 3, lane b). As described by others (30Boren J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Spring D.J. Chen-Liu L.W. Chatterton J.E. Elovson J. Schumaker V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14839-14845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a relatively discontinuous pattern of truncated forms was observed. Thus, the quantification of 26 truncated forms ranging from apoB17 to full-length apoB100 can be accurately performed (Fig. 3, lane c) and designated as percentage of full-length apoB100 using human apoB100, apoB72, apoB53, apoB48, apoB29, and apoB18 as molecular mass standards (27Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. Linton M.F. Taylor S.M. Youg S.G. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3300-3308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28McLeod R.S. Zhao Y. Selby S.L. Westerlund J. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2852-2862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of the MTP inhibitor on the secretion of these 26 truncated forms of apoB. As shown in Fig.4, low concentrations of the inhibitor markedly reduced the secretion of apoB polypeptides longer than apoB53. At higher concentrations, intermediate sized forms of apoB began to be affected. Smaller truncated forms (apoB17 to apoB26) were insensitive to high concentrations of the MTP inhibitor. Importantly, we found that the effect of MTP inhibition was not simply a linear function of apoB length (Figs. 4 and5). A clear transition was observed between apoB51 and apoB53. The concentration of the MTP inhibitor required to decrease the secretion of apoB51 by 50% (IC50) was 11.3 μm compared with 1.2 μm for apoB53 (Fig. 5). Even in the absence of oleic acid, the IC50values for apoB51 and apoB53 still remained different, being 3.2 and 0.46 μm, respectively (data not shown). These results on HepG2 cells are consistent with our previous findings using mhAT3F, Caco-2, and transfected McA-RH7777 cell lines and allow us to define more precisely the critical domain within apoB that confers a high requirement for MTP activity. This domain is localized between apoB51 and apoB53, which represents a sequence of less than 100 amino acids. Previous studies have established that there is a direct relationship between apoB size and the density of lipoproteins secreted from HepG2 cells (30Boren J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Spring D.J. Chen-Liu L.W. Chatterton J.E. Elovson J. Schumaker V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14839-14845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We studied the effect of the MTP inhibitor on the density of lipoproteins formed with truncated apoB generated by puromycin treatment. Lipoproteins secreted by HepG2 cells incubated with or without the MTP inhibitor (1.5 μm) were analyzed by sequential flotation ultracentrifugation. For each fraction, apoB was immunoprecipitated and analyzed as before. ApoB truncated forms smaller than apoB29 were found mainly in the density >1.21 fraction (Fig. 6, lane i). This fraction contained also albumin- and lipid-free proteins (data not shown). ApoB32 to apoB44, apoB46 to apoB63, and apoB68 to apoB83 were found within densities of 1.21–1.11, 1.11–1.07, and 1.07–1.04, respectively (lanes g,e, and c).

Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 233-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our hands, inhibition of MTP did not modify the density at which truncated forms are found, although it decreased the amount of large truncated forms of apoB (Fig. 6, lanes a–j). Large forms such as apoB100 or apoB90 were still present at a density less than 1.040 (Fig. 6, lane b versus lane a). Similarly, smaller forms such as apoB34 or apoB35 remained in the 1.210–1.110 density range (lane h versus lane g), and none of them shifted to the lipid-free fraction in the presence of the MTP inhibitor (lane j). These results suggest that the inhibition of the lipid assembly mediated by MTP does not significantly modify the lipid:protein ratio but rather decreases the number of secreted particles. Taken together, these results indicate first that each carboxyl-terminally apoB truncated form requires a defined amount of lipid to attain a secretable conformation and second that the inhibition of MTP-mediated assembly with lipid reduces the number of particles that attain this state. The sequence between apoB51 and apoB53 constitutes a structural domain that is highly dependent on MTP-mediated lipid transfer for proper folding and secretion. Next we examined whether the sensitivity of truncated forms of apoB longer than apoB53 to MTP inhibition occurred at the early stages of the lipoprotein assembly process. Following a 10-min chase in the presence of puromycin and cycloheximide, nascent lipoproteins were extracted from the ER of HepG2 cells with NaCO3. The MTP inhibitor (10 μm) substantially decreased the number of apoB polypeptides longer than apoB53 in the lumen of the ER (Fig. 7,lane b versus lane a). The sharp transition in behavior between apoB51 and apoB53 was similar to that observed in our secretion experiment (Figs.4, 5, and 7, lanes c and d). Likewise, the densities of the lipoproteins in the lumen of the ER were comparable with those secreted following a 2-h chase (Fig.8). These results indicate that the size-related sensitivity of apoB to MTP inhibition is due to very early events in the lipoprotein assembly process and not related to differences in the downstream processing or secretion events. In addition, we conclude that all of the lipid loaded onto apoB in HepG2 cells takes place within the first 10 min of assembly.Figure 8Comparison between the density of lipoproteins assembled around truncated forms of apoB present in the ER or secreted.

Overexpression of Csk repressed the in vitro kinase activity of Src to as little as 10% that of control cells and interfered with cell spreading and cell attachment to fibronectin. Focal adhesion assembly and the organization of actin stress fibers were also disrupted in cells overexpressing Csk. On the other hand, overexpression of Csk-ΔK induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, including the paxillin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and enhanced to some extent the cytoskeletal organization and the rate of cell spreading on fibronectin, indicating that Src or its relatives was functionally activated in the cells. Paxillin was also tyrosine-phosphorylated in Csk-overexpressing cells, indicating that it can serve as a substrate of Csk. The phosphorylation state of paxillin in cells overexpressing Csk was indistinguishable from that in cells expressing Csk-ΔK in that both phosphorylated paxillins bound equally to SH2 domain of Csk and were co-immunoprecipitated with Csk. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and its in vitroautophosphorylation activity were increased only in cells expressing Csk-ΔK. In Csk-expressing cells, the kinase activity of FAK was substantially decreased to 20–30% that of control cells, even though the expression level of FAK was rather increased. These findings suggest that Csk regulates Src family tyrosine kinases that play essential roles in the regulation of cell adhesion via a FAK-dependent mechanism and that the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin alone may not be sufficient for the regulation of the cell adhesion mechanism in astrocytes.

Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is a crucial step in the signal transduction cascades triggered by a variety of extra cellular stimuli that modulate cellular functions. Receptor-type tyrosine kinases are activated by ligand binding and directly transduce the extracellular information into intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation events, whereas nonreceptor tyrosine kinases function as signal transducers in concert with receptor-like molecules that lack tyrosine kinase activities. Src family tyrosine kinases are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that are functionally linked to some receptor-type tyrosine kinases (1Ralston R. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because of their functional redundancy, the essential roles of Src family tyrosine kinases still remain to be elucidated (7Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Imamoto A. Nature. 1995; 376: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Src family tyrosine kinases are membrane-associated proteins having Src homology 2 (SH2)1 and SH3 domains, which are important for protein-protein interaction. The activity of Src family tyrosine kinases is regulated through intramolecular interaction between the SH2 domain and the phosphorylated tyrosine at the C-terminal regulatory site (Tyr-527) (8Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), and it is predicted that displacement of this interaction by another molecule that can bind to the Src SH2 or SH3 domain or dephosphorylation of Tyr-527 can activate the kinase. Although the mechanism of activation coupled with receptor stimulation is still unclear, the tyrosine kinase Csk (C-terminal Src kinase) has been identified as a negative regulator of Src family tyrosine kinases (9Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 10Okada M. Nada S. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24249-24252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Csk acts specifically on the regulatory sites of the family members, and targeted disruption of the cskgene caused constitutive activation of Src family tyrosine kinases accompanied by a defect in neurulation (11Nada S. Yagi T. Takeda H. Tokunaga T. Nakagawa H. Ikawa Y. Okada M. Aizawa S. Cell. 1993; 73: 1125-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 12Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). On the other hand, overexpression of Csk in some cell lines induced repression of cellular signaling mediated by Src family tyrosine kinases (13Chow L.M.L. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nature. 1993; 365: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 14Sabe H. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4706-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). From these observations, it has been suggested that a balance between Src family tyrosine kinases and Csk might define the basal function of Src family tyrosine kinases. It is also known that some members of the Src family are targeted to cell adhesion plaque during the process of cell adhesion (15Liebl E.C. Martin G.S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2417-2428PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kaplan K.B. Bibbins K.B. Swedlow J.R. Arnaud W. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4745-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Cells transformed by v-Src cause rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton structure accompanied by anchorage-independent growth (17Parsons J.T. Weber M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 147: 79-127PubMed Google Scholar). In Src-transformed and Csk-deficient cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of some focal adhesion proteins, including FAK (focal adhesion kinase) and paxillin, were elevated, implicating the role of Src in the regulation of cell adhesion (7Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Imamoto A. Nature. 1995; 376: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 18Nada S. Okada M. Aizawa S. Nakagawa H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3571-3578PubMed Google Scholar). The cell adhesion mechanism not only allows cells to adhere to one another but also transduces signals involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization and gene expression. In such a signaling cascade, the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase FAK is regarded as a critical signaling molecule, as deduced from observations of FAK-deficient and FAK-overexpressing cells (19Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar, 20Cary L. Chang L. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FAK is enriched in focal adhesion through interaction with a cell adhesion receptor, integrin, and is activated upon cell attachment on the extracellular matrix (ECM) (21Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar,22Guan J.L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). The activation is accompanied by autophosphorylation of Tyr-397, which creates an Src SH2 binding site (23Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Src is subsequently activated through this interaction, thereby phosphorylating FAK at Tyr-925 to create another binding site for the signaling molecule Grb2/Sos to drive the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (21Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar, 24Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore, a recent study has indicated that tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin by Src may be a critical step in focal adhesion assembly (26Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Src is an important mediator of signals originating from cell adhesion through FAK, although the molecular mechanism leading to the regulation of cytoskeletal organization and gene expression has yet to be elucidated. The nervous system is a highly complex structure composed of a variety of cells, including neuronal and glial cells. During the development of the nervous system, cell-cell and cell-ECM interaction is one of the key processes in the highly organized proliferation of precursor cells, differentiation, axon guidance, synapse formation, and cell death. There is a line of evidence suggesting that Src family tyrosine kinases are involved in the regulation of cell-cell and/or cell-ECM interaction in the nervous system (27Grant S.G.N. Karl K.A. Kiebler M.A. Kandel E.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1909-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 28Beggs M.E. Soriano P. Maness P.F. J.

Neuron. 1994; 12: 873-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that suppression of Src family kinases by the expression of a membrane-targeted Csk in neurally differentiated P19 cells induced inhibition of cell-cell interaction mediated by the neural cell adhesion molecule (6Takayama Y. Nada S. Nagai K. Okada M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the involvement of Csk in the regulation of the cell adhesion mechanism mediated by the FAK/Src pathway, we here employed primary cultured type I astrocytes and an adenovirus-mediated gene transfer system to obtain the efficient overexpression of Csk in primary cultures. Overexpression of the wild-type Csk readily repressed the kinase activity of Src and inhibited cell spreading and attachment to the ECM. Biochemical links between the phenotype and the tyrosine phosphorylation of cell adhesion proteins were also investigated. To obtain a primary culture of type I astrocytes from mice (ICR strain), brain cortex regions were dissected from embryos at embryonic day 18 (E18) and immediately soaked in ice-cold isotonic buffer (137 mm NaCl, 0.17 mmNa2HPO4, 0.22 mmKH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 59 mm sucrose, 5.4 mm KCl). After removing the meninges, the tissues were shattered with scissors and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of 0.1% dispase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.05% DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim). The dispersed cells were further dissected by pipetting with a 10-ml disposable pipette fitted with a 0.2-ml tip for use in a nonautomated pipetter. The cell suspension was filtered through double sheets of lens cleaning paper (Fuji Film) to remove undispersed fragments. After removing dispase and DNaseI by centrifugation, cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Cell suspensions were plated in tissue culture-grade dishes coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma) and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Cells were used for experiments after passaging twice to remove neuron-like cells. The MluI fragment of Csk cDNA was blunted, ligated with PvuI linker, then inserted into the PacI site of the cosmid cassette of pAx1CAwt, which carries the CAG promoter (a gift from Dr. I. Saitoh and Dr. J. Miyazaki) (30Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saitoh I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 31Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar). A kinase-negative mutant of Csk (Csk-ΔK) was generated by substituting Arg for Lys-222 by the Kunkel method. The construction of the mutant was confirmed by direct sequencing. Csk-ΔK was inserted into pAx1CAwt as described for Csk. The recombinant adenovirus was obtained as described elsewhere (32Khan M.A. Okumura N. Okada M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cassette containing the Csk expression unit was co-transfected into human kidney 293 cells together with an adenovirus genome DNA-terminal protein complex, which was digested at several sites withEcoT2321 or AseI/EcoRI. The targeted recombinant adenovirus carrying the csk gene (Ax1CATcsk) or its kinase-deficient mutant (Ax1CATcsk-ΔK) was generated by overlapping recombination. After maintaining the 293 cells for 10–15 days, the virus clones were isolated. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing rat cDNA fragments of Csk domains SH2 (nucleotides 71–299), SH3 (nucleotides 300–626), or SH2/3 (nucleotides 71–626) were synthesized as described previously(32). Astrocytes expressing β-galactosidase, wild-type Csk, or Csk-ΔK were detached from culture dishes by treatment with trypsin (0.25% trypsin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4) for 10 min at 37 °C. The detached cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and portions of the cells were plated at a concentration of 2.5 × 104cells/cm2 on tissue culture-grade dishes or plates coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin. At the indicated intervals, the cultures were washed twice with PBS to remove unattached cells. Attached cells were fixed with 3.5% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and washed twice with PBS. The number of attached cells was estimated by staining with 0.1% crystal violet in PBS. After washing twice with PBS, the dye was eluted with 500 μl of 10% acetic acid, and the absorbance at 600 nm was measured. The background value was obtained from empty plates coated with fibronectin. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against phosphotyrosine (clones 4G10 and PY20, Transduction Laboratories), recombinant horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (RC-20, Transduction Laboratories), anti-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) monoclonal antibody (clone 77, Transduction Laboratories), anti-v-Src monoclonal antibody (clone Mab 327, Calbiochem), anti-paxillin antibody (clone 177, Transduction Laboratories), anti-Csk monoclonal antibody (clone 52, Transduction Laboratories), anti-vinculin monoclonal antibody (clone V284, Cymbus Bioscience), and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) monoclonal antibody (clone G-A-5, Boehringer Mannhein) were employed. For Western blotting, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were used as secondary antibodies. Primary culture type I astrocytes were plated onto glass coverslips coated with collagen. The cells were allowed to grow for 5 days after infection with the adenovirus. They were then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, followed by treatment with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After this, the cells were incubated with anti-paxillin, anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20), GFAP antibodies and further incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas red-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies. For F-actin staining, rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was used instead of the antibodies. Cells fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde were washed twice in PBS and then incubated with X-gal staining solution (50 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 50 mmK4Fe(CN)6, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.2% X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactoside) in PBS) for 3 h at 37 °C. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Subsequently, the membrane was treated with blocking reagent (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Tween-TBS)) for 2 h at room temperature. The blocked membrane was probed with primary antibodies and further incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The immunoreactivity was visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (DuPont). Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and then lysed with 400 μl of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) or TNE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The cell lysates were incubated with 20 μl of 10% pansorbin cells (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 4 °C, after which the pansorbin cells were removed by centrifugation to clear the lysate. The precleared lysate was incubated with the respective antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, 0.1 μg of anti-mouse IgG was added, and the complexes were further incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were recovered from the lysates by incubation with 20 μl of 10% pansorbin cells for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by sequential washing with a cushion of 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 1 m sucrose, twice with radioimmune precipitation buffer buffer, and twice further with TNE buffer. The immunocomplexes obtained were resuspended in 20 μl of TNE buffer. The kinase activity of Src and FAK were determined by quantifying the amount of radiolabeled phosphate incorporated into acid-treated enolase or polyglutamate tyrosine (poly-EY), respectively. Src and FAK were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate as described above. An aliquot of immunocomplex was mixed with 18 μl of an ice-cold reaction mixture (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 2.5 μg of rabbit mouse enolase (Sigma), and 5 μm ATP), and the kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 3 min to terminate the reaction. The phosphorylated proteins or substrates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography or quantified by a BAS2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film). To analyze the role of Csk under near in vivo conditions, wild-type Csk (Csk) and the kinase-negative Csk mutant (Csk-ΔK) were transiently overexpressed in the primary cultured type I astrocytes. Recombinant adenovirus vectors were used to obtain an efficient introduction of ectopic genes into the primary cultures. Type I astrocytes were infected by Ax1CAT-lacZ(10 multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.)), Ax1CATcsk (1.25–10 m.o.i.), or Ax1CATcsk-ΔK (10 m.o.i.), and the expression of Csk protein was determined by Western blotting 5 days after infection. Although the expression of Csk in the control cells and cells infected by Ax1CAT-lacZwas at quite low levels, Csk protein was overexpressed in cells infected by Ax1CATcsk or Ax1CATcsk-ΔK in an m.o.i.-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). The efficiency of the infection was confirmed by X-gal staining of cells infected by Ax1CAT-lacZ, which showed that almost 100% efficiency was achieved (Fig. 2 A). Depending upon the dose of Csk protein, the in vitro kinase activity of Src was repressed in cells overexpressing Csk to as little as 10% that of the control cells. However, activation of the in vitro kinase activity of Src could not be detected in cells expressing Csk-ΔK (Fig. 1 B).Figure 2Inhibition of cell spreading on collagen by overexpression of Csk. A, to determine the efficiency of infection with the recombinant adenovirus, primary culture astrocytes were infected with 10 m.o.i. of the recombinant adenovirus carrying the lacZ gene (Ax-CATlacZ). Forty-eight h after infection, the cells were fixed with formaldehyde and incubated with X-gal-staining solution. B–E, cells were plated onto dishes coated with collagen. After 2 days, astrocytes were infected with 10 m.o.i. of the recombinant adenovirus carrying thelacZ gene (Ax-CATlacZ(C)), Csk (Ax-CATCsk (D)), or Csk-ΔK (Ax-CAT-Csk-ΔK (E)). Cells were allowed to grow for 5 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cell morphologies of adenovirus-infected cells were compared with those of the control cells (B) by means of phase-contrast microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of Csk overexpression on the morphology of astrocytes was observed under phase-contrast microscopy. The control astrocytes exhibited widely spread, polygonal shapes with obvious cytoplasmic edges, although some developing cells were rounded (Fig.2 B). Cells expressing β-galactosidase did not show any morphological change (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, overexpression of Csk induced a dramatic change in the cell morphology; the majority of the cells had spread very poorly and remained rounded with only a few attachment sites (Fig. 2 D). The morphology of cells expressing Csk-ΔK appeared to be almost the same as that of the control cells, although some had spread more vigorously than the control cells (Fig. 2 E). To compare the abilities of cells to attach to the ECM, cell adhesion assays were performed. The control cells and those expressing Csk-ΔK began to attach to fibronectin-coated dishes within 20 min after plating, and about 60% of them were attached after around 60 min. In contrast, the Csk-expressing cells did not begin to attach to the dishes until 60 min after plating (Fig.3 A), and the majority still remained unattached even after 6 h, when attachment of the control cells and those expressing Csk-ΔK were almost completed (data not shown). The morphologies of cells 40 min after plating are compared in Fig. 3, B–D. It can be seen that cells expressing Csk-ΔK spread more rapidly than control cells (Fig. 3 D), whereas none of cells expressing Csk had become attached at this point (Fig.3 C). To examine the molecular basis of the phenomena observed in Csk-expressing astrocytes, the organization of the F-actin cytoskeleton and the distribution of the focal adhesion proteins were analyzed. Cells expressing β-galactosidase, Csk, or Csk-ΔK were all stained by an antibody against GFAP, confirming that these cells maintained their astrocyte characteristics (Fig. 4,A–C). Staining with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin indicated that the total amount of F-actin in the Csk-expressing cells was comparable with that in the other cell types. However, the F-actin in the Csk-expressing cells displayed a disordered structure and was condensed at the peripheral regions of the cells (Fig. 4 E). In some cells expressing Csk-ΔK, the organization of F-actin was more evident than in the control cells (Fig. 4, D andF). The organization of focal adhesion was examined by staining with anti-paxillin and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig.4, G–L). Patchy staining around the cell peripheries, which is characteristic of focal adhesion, was observed in the control cells and in those expressing Csk-ΔK, whereas the focal adhesion staining was dramatically reduced in the Csk-expressing cells, indicating that the formation or maintenance of a focal adhesion structure was disturbed by Csk expression. The effects of Csk and Csk-ΔK expression on the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins were investigated by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 5 A). In the control and β-galactosidase-expressing cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation levels were relatively low (lanes 1 and2). Overexpression of Csk induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in a dose-dependent manner, with prominent phosphorylation being obtained for 70- and 100-kDa proteins (lanes 3–6). Overexpression of Csk-ΔK also induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of some proteins, including a 70-kDa protein, although the phosphorylation of a 125-kDa protein was induced in place of a 100-kDa protein (lane 7). To identify the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, several candidate proteins involved in cell adhesion were examined with regard to their expression and tyrosine phosphorylation levels. The expressions of the focal adhesion proteins vinculin, FAK, and paxillin was first confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 5 B). The expression of vinculin was not affected by the expression of Csk or Csk-ΔK. The total amount of paxillin was not affected, but mobility shifts on SDS-PAGE, probably because of the phosphorylation, were observed with cells expressing Csk and Csk-ΔK. A slight increase in the expression of FAK was observed only in the case of Csk-expressing cells. Overall, however, there were no obvious changes in the expression of focal adhesion proteins in either cell type. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the proteins was detected by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.5 C, tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin (70 kDa) was dramatically elevated in cells expressing Csk or Csk-ΔK. FAK (125 kDa) was found to be heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated only in cells expressing Csk-ΔK (Fig. 5 D). The tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins having a similar M r to that of FAK, such as p130cas or PYK2 (CAKβ), was not detected (data not shown). Thus, it is suggested that the 70-kDa protein phosphorylated in both Csk- and Csk-ΔK-expressing cells was paxillin, whereas the 125-kDa protein in cells expressing Csk-ΔK was FAK. The phosphorylated 100-kDa protein found in Csk-expressing cells was not identified. Paxillin is known to be a good substrate for Src, Csk, and FAK (33Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). To further confirm the identification of the 70-kDa protein as paxillin and determine the kinase responsible for paxillin phosphorylation in the cells, Src, Csk, and Csk-ΔK were co-immunoprecipitated with paxillin, and the immunocomplexes were subjected to in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 6). Paxillin was phosphorylated by Src or Csk but not by Csk-ΔK, suggesting that paxillin phosphorylation was mediated by Csk itself in Csk-expressing cells. In cells expressing Csk-ΔK, the paxillin was phosphorylated by a kinase(s) activated by the expression of Csk-ΔK, possibly Src and/or FAK. It has been reported that Src and Csk phosphorylate the identical paxillin residues in vitro (33Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) To compare the properties of the tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillins in cells expressing Csk and Csk-ΔK, the abilities of the two species of paxillin to interact with Csk in vitro were investigated. As shown in Fig.7 A, the tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillins in cells expressing Csk and Csk-ΔK were both co-precipitated with GST fusion proteins containing the SH2 domain of Csk. There were no differences in the amount of paxillin precipitated, the migration pattern on SDS-PAGE, or the tyrosine phosphorylation level between the two species of paxillin. In addition, they were equally co-immunoprecipitated with Csk from the cell lysates of cells expressing Csk or Csk-ΔK (Fig. 7 B). These observations suggest that the phosphorylation states of the two species of paxillin were functionally identical. Tyrosine phosphorylation and the kinase activity of FAK have been reported to increase upon cell attachment to fibronectin (22Guan J.L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). In addition, FAK-deficient cells displayed poor spreading and a rounded cell morphology, indicative of the critical role of FAK in the regulation of cell adhesion (19Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). As Csk-overexpressing cells displayed the phenotype similar to that of FAK-deficient cells, we estimated the kinase activity of FAK in cells expressing Csk or Csk-ΔK. The autophosphorylation activity and the activity for an ectopic substrate (poly-EY) in immunoprecipitated FAK were determined by in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 8). The amount of FAK in immunoprecipitates were evaluated by Western blotting (Fig. 8 A, upper panel). The relative activity of them were estimated by dividing the total activity by the amounts of FAK in immunoprecipitates (Fig. 8 B). In Csk-expressing cells, both the relative autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation activities of FAK were decreased to 20–30% those of control cells. In cells expressing Csk-ΔK, however, relative autophosphorylation activity was elevated 1.5-fold over that in control cells, which is consistent with the observation that FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated in astrocytes expressing Csk-ΔK. We have shown that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Csk in type I astrocytes inhibited cell spreading and attachment to the ECM, and these effects were accompanied by defects in the cell adhesions and cytoskeletal organization. By contrast, overexpression of Csk-ΔK enhanced the cell adhesion capability to some extent. These findings suggested that overexpressed Csk may target a critical point(s) in the regulation of cell adhesion machinery. In cells expressing Csk, thein vitro Src activity was repressed in a manner dependent on the amount of Csk protein expressed, showing that the function of the Src was successfully attenuated by Csk. Unexpectedly, overexpression of Csk-ΔK did not have a dominant-negative effect on in vitroSrc activity. However, the tyrosine phosphorylation of some cellular proteins, including the Src substrates paxillin and FAK, was increased in cells expressing Csk-ΔK. It has been reported that overexpression of Csk in CHO cells enhanced insulin-stimulated dephosphorylation of FAK, whereas overexpression of Csk-ΔK inhibited the dephosphorylation of FAK and paxillin but somewhat enhanced the basal tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (34Tobe K. Sabe H. Yamamoto T. Yamauchi T. Asai S. Kaburagi Y. Tamemoto H. Ueki K. Kimura H. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Hanafusa H. Kadowaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These findings together with our observations suggest that Src or its relatives are functionally activated in cells overexpressing Csk-ΔK. Although we do not have direct evidence, it is likely that the turnover rate of phosphorylation at the C-terminal regulatory site of Src is accelerated through inhibition of Csk by the overexpression of Csk-ΔK and that the transiently activated Src may be involved in the accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. In cells overexpressing Csk, tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, including paxillin and an as-yet unidentified 100-kDa protein, was increased, suggesting that Csk, when substantially overexpressed, can act on proteins other than Src family tyrosine kinases, although the physiological meanings of this has yet to be determined. There is accumulating evidence that FAK and Src are essential signaling molecules in the regulation of the cell adhesion mechanism (19Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar, 20Cary L. Chang L. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar, 22Guan J.L. Shalloway D.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated here that the tyrosine kinase activity of FAK was decreased in cells overexpressing Csk and that the expression of Csk-ΔK induced elevation of the autophosphorylation activity and tyrosine phosphorylation level of FAK. The phenotype of Csk-expressing cells was also consistent with that of cells obtained from FAK-deficient mice (19Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar), suggesting that loss of FAK function may account for some aspects of the phenotype of Csk-expressing cells. It is well known that FAK activation induced by cell attachment recruits Src to activate it, thereby inducing the phosphorylation of Src substrates, including FAK itself and paxillin (23Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation recruits Grb2-Sos and Paxillin-Crk-C3G adapter protein complexes into the focal adhesion and ultimately activates the Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway (21Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar). The Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion by modulating the organization of the cytoskeletal structure. Because Src was targeted in Csk-expressing cells, the pathway downstream of Src might be shut down in the cells, resulting in defects in cytoskeletal organization. Thus, it is more likely that loss of FAK activation in Csk-expressing cells is a secondary result of loss of cell adhesion elicited by defects in the cytoskeletal organization mediated by Src. We observed that the expression level of FAK was slightly increased in cells expressing Csk, in which the kinase activity of FAK was repressed. This suggests that there is an up-regulation system in FAK expression regulated by the total activity of FAK itself. A similar phenomenon was observed in the cells obtained from cskknockout mice, in which the expression of Src was down-regulated by the constitutive activation of Src because of the lack of Csk (18Nada S. Okada M. Aizawa S. Nakagawa H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3571-3578PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies on the molecular mechanism leading to the feedback regulation of gene expression might provide a new clue to understanding the roles of tyrosine kinases. Recently, it has been shown that overexpression of the C-terminal portion of FAK inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin and, in addition, delays cell spreading and focal adhesion assembly (26Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and that the inhibitory effects of the C-terminal FAK can be rescued by coexpression of FAK or Src but not by a FAK mutant that fails to bind Src and paxillin (26Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Because tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin is always observed when overcoming the inhibition of cell spreading by the C-terminal FAK, it is suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin mediated by Src is a critical step in focal adhesion assembly. In this study, the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was induced by overexpressing active Csk in a manner independent of FAK and/or Src. Paxillin in Csk-expressing cells was tyrosine-phosphorylated at an equivalent level to that in cells expressing Csk-ΔK, and the two species of phosphorylated paxillins were functionally identical in terms of specific interaction with the SH2 domain of Csk. In addition, it has been shown that Src, Csk, and FAK phosphorylate identical sites of paxillin in vitro (33Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). However, cell morphology and the ability of cells to spread and attach to the ECM were selectively abrogated in cells expressing Csk. Thus it is suggested from the findings of this study that although tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin may be required, it is not sufficient to regulate the cell adhesion mechanism of astrocytes. Identification of another molecule(s) downstream of Src may be necessary to elucidate the pathway leading to the regulation of cytoskeletal organization. This work has further highlighted the importance of Src in the regulation of the cell adhesion mechanism by using Csk, a regulator kinase of Src. A crystallographic analysis of the repressed form of c-Src indicated that displacement of the intracellular binding between the SH2 domain and the C-terminal phosphotyrosine (Tyr-527) by another protein can activate Src without dephosphorylation of Tyr-527 (35Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Indeed, it is shown that autophosphorylated FAK can act as an activator through such a mechanism. However, overexpression of Csk readily modulated the kinase activity of Src in the cells, suggesting that a tyrosine phosphatase(s) directed to Tyr-527 is also important during the process of cell adhesion. To identify such a phosphatase, our system for obtaining efficient overexpression of Csk may be useful.

Using this superposition, we have built a view of the Fru-2,6-P2-bound enzyme and identify the residues responsible for catalysis. This analysis yields distinct catalytic mechanisms for the wild type and mutant proteins. The wild type mechanism would lead to an inefficient transfer of a proton to the leaving group Fru-6-P, which is consistent with a view of this event being rate-limiting, explaining the extremely slow turnover (0.032 s−1) of the Fru-2,6-Pase in all Fru-6-P,2-kinase/Fru-2,6-Pase isozymes.

The kinase domains are in close contact, forming an extended hydrophobic core between them, while the phosphatase domains are essentially independent of one another.

Thus, the catalytic histidine (His258 in RL2K, His256 in RT2K) was proposed to make a nucleophilic attack on the 2-phosphate of Fru2,6-P2, while positively charged side chains (Arg257 and Arg307 in RL2K, Arg255and Arg305 in RT2K) orient the 2-phosphate and stabilize the transition state. His392 (His390 in RT2K) was proposed to be coupled to Glu327 (Glu325 in RT2K), making His392 doubly protonated, and capable of donating a proton to the leaving group oxygen of Fru-6-P. A water, activated by Glu327, would then attack the phosphoenzyme intermediate, regenerating the enzyme and producing a free PO4 ion (8Lee Y.-H. Ogata C. Pflugrath J.W. Levitt D.G. Sarma R.

J. 1995; 308: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This interpretation of the mutagenesis and the proposed reaction mechanism are largely in agreement with the RT2K-Wo and RL2K Fru-2,6-Pase domain structures, with the exception of the role of His390, which is neither coupled to Glu325, nor in a position to donate a proton to Fru-6-P. It is important to note, however, that neither the RT2K-Wo nor the original RL2K Fru-2,6-Pase domain structures contained bound ligands (Fru-6-P or Fru-2,6-P2), which has hampered a thorough characterization of the Fru-2,6-Pase mechanism. The report of a trapped RL2K phosphoenzyme intermediate (21Lee Y.-H. Olson T.W. Ogata C.M. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Lange A.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the work presented here combine to remedy this deficiency.To facilitate our own crystallographic studies of the RT2K kinase reaction, we generated a mutant protein, H256A, that as reported for the RL2K H258A mutant (16Tauler A. Lin K. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15617-15622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), would be devoid of phosphatase activity (and allow us to soak Fru-2,6-P2 into crystals without consumption by the Fru-2,6-Pase reaction). This enzyme unexpectedly retains 17% of the RT2K-Wo Fru-2,6-Pase activity and led to a series of experiments to assess the basis for this activity. The results of mutagenesis and kinetic analyses on the Fru-2,6-Pase domain of the RT2K isozyme are presented in a companion paper (1Mizuguchi H. Cook P.F. Tai C.-H. Hasemann C.A. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 2166-2175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We report here the crystallographic structure of the Fru-2,6-Pase domain of the RT2K H256A mutant enzyme. This structure includes bound Fru-6-P and PO4 ligands in the active site. Based on a comparison of the RT2K-Wo, H256A mutant, and the RL2K phosphoenzyme structures, we propose catalytic mechanisms that explain the observed kinetic data for both mutant and wild type enzymes. The bifunctional enzyme fructose-6-phosphate,2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (Fru-6-P,2-kinase1/Fru-2,6-Pase) participates in glucose homeostasis by regulating the intracellular concentration of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2). Fru-2,6-P2 is both a potent physiological activator of 6-phosphofructokinase, and an in vitro inhibitor of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (reviewed in Refs.2Uyeda K. Kuby S.A. Study of Enzymes II.

Istvan E.S. Uyeda K. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1996; 4: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The kinase domains are in close contact, forming an extended hydrophobic core between them, while the phosphatase domains are essentially independent of one another. The structure of the isolated rat liver Fru-6-P,2-kinase/Fru-2,6-Pase (RL2K) Fru-2,6-Pase domain has also been determined (8Lee Y.-H. Ogata C. Pflugrath J.W. Levitt D.G. Sarma R. Banaszak L.J.

Thus, the catalytic histidine (His258 in RL2K, His256 in RT2K) was proposed to make a nucleophilic attack on the 2-phosphate of Fru2,6-P2, while positively charged side chains (Arg257 and Arg307 in RL2K, Arg255and Arg305 in RT2K) orient the 2-phosphate and stabilize the transition state. His392 (His390 in RT2K) was proposed to be coupled to Glu327 (Glu325 in RT2K), making His392 doubly protonated, and capable of donating a proton to the leaving group oxygen of Fru-6-P. A water, activated by Glu327, would then attack the phosphoenzyme intermediate, regenerating the enzyme and producing a free PO4 ion (8Lee Y.-H. Ogata C. Pflugrath J.W. Levitt D.G. Sarma R.

This interpretation of the mutagenesis and the proposed reaction mechanism are largely in agreement with the RT2K-Wo and RL2K Fru-2,6-Pase domain structures, with the exception of the role of His390, which is neither coupled to Glu325, nor in a position to donate a proton to Fru-6-P. It is important to note, however, that neither the RT2K-Wo nor the original RL2K Fru-2,6-Pase domain structures contained bound ligands (Fru-6-P or Fru-2,6-P2), which has hampered a thorough characterization of the Fru-2,6-Pase mechanism. The report of a trapped RL2K phosphoenzyme intermediate (21Lee Y.-H. Olson T.W. Ogata C.M. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Lange A.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the work presented here combine to remedy this deficiency. To facilitate our own crystallographic studies of the RT2K kinase reaction, we generated a mutant protein, H256A, that as reported for the RL2K H258A mutant (16Tauler A. Lin K. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15617-15622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), would be devoid of phosphatase activity (and allow us to soak Fru-2,6-P2 into crystals without consumption by the Fru-2,6-Pase reaction). This enzyme unexpectedly retains 17% of the RT2K-Wo Fru-2,6-Pase activity and led to a series of experiments to assess the basis for this activity. The results of mutagenesis and kinetic analyses on the Fru-2,6-Pase domain of the RT2K isozyme are presented in a companion paper (1Mizuguchi H. Cook P.F. Tai C.-H. Hasemann C.A. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 2166-2175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We report here the crystallographic structure of the Fru-2,6-Pase domain of the RT2K H256A mutant enzyme. This structure includes bound Fru-6-P and PO4 ligands in the active site. Based on a comparison of the RT2K-Wo, H256A mutant, and the RL2K phosphoenzyme structures, we propose catalytic mechanisms that explain the observed kinetic data for both mutant and wild type enzymes. We thank Cu Nguyen and Yang Li for excellent technical assistance in the preparation of the enzyme, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute x-ray facility for access to diffraction equipment."

This is the first tight-binding inhibitor characterized for this enzyme. Leukotriene C4 was competitive with respect to glutathione and non-competitive toward the second substrate, CDNB.

Leukotrienes A4, D4, and E4 were much weaker inhibitors of the purified enzyme (by at least 3 orders of magnitude). Leukotriene C4 analogues, which have been developed as antagonists of leukotriene receptors, were found to display varying degrees of inhibition of MGST-1. In particular, the cysteinyl-leukotriene analogues SKF 104,353, ONO-1078, and BAYu9773 were strong inhibitors (IC50 values: 0.13, 3.7, and 7.6 μm, respectively). In view of the partial structural similarity between MGST-1, leukotriene C4synthase, and 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP), it was of interest that leukotriene C4 synthesis inhibitors (which antagonize FLAP) also displayed significant inhibition (e.g. IC50 for BAYx1005 was 58 μm). In contrast, selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors such as zileuton only marginally inhibited activity at high concentrations (500 μm). Our discovery that leukotriene C4 and drugs developed based on its structure are potent inhibitors of MGST-1 raises the possibility that MGST-1 influences the cellular processing of leukotrienes.

Adv. Cancer Res. 1979; 29: 175-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). A membrane-bound member of this family has been isolated (6Morgenstern R. Guthenberg C. DePierre J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and named microsomal glutathione transferase-1 (MGST-1).1 This homotrimeric enzyme has a distinct amino acid sequence and immunological properties that are different from its cytosolic counterparts (6Morgenstern R.

Chem. 1988; 263: 8430-8436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another discriminating property is its ability to be activated (up to 15-fold) by thiol reagents and proteolysis (8Morgenstern R. Lundqvist G. Jörnvall H. DePierre J.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Morgenstern R. DePierre J.W. Ernster L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 87: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). An important function of the enzyme is thought to involve protection of intracellular membranes from oxidative modification as a result of oxidative stress (10Mosialou E. Ekström G. Adang A.E.P. Morgenstern R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 1645-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), through the reduction of phospholipid and fatty acid hydroperoxides (11Mosialou E. Piemonte F. Andersson C. Vos R. Van Bladeren P.J. Morgenstern R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A relationship between MGST-1 and the leukotriene pathway proteins leukotriene (LT) C4-synthase and 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) is indicated by similarities in size, hydropathy, and primary structure (12Weinander R.

Soderstrom M. Hammarstrom S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 15Söderström M. Morgenstern R. Hammarström S. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, additional members of this putative protein superfamily that display common functional properties have recently been described (13Jakobsson P.-J. Mancini J.A. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22203-22210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Jakobsson P.-J. Mancini J.A. Riendeau D. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. J. Biol.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes are potent proinflammatory mediators that contribute to the pathophysiology of asthma. Hence, drugs which block formation or receptors for cysteinyl-leukotrienes are currently introduced as new therapy in asthma (17$$Google Scholar). LTC4-synthase is homologous to FLAP (18Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 744: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Microsomal GST-1 has been identified as a high capacity “low affinity” binding protein for LTC4 and was found to bind one molecule LTC4 per trimer (19Metters K.M. Sawyer N. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Goffinet A. Nguyen A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 161: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The purified protein did not display binding unless heat-inactivated microsomes had been added, implying the dependence on additional factors. The present study was undertaken to determine whether LTC4 could in fact bind to MGST-1 under physiological conditions and whether such binding would influence the activity of the enzyme. Having established that this was indeed the case, we determined whether other leukotrienes and clinically developed inhibitors of leukotriene formation or receptors also were inhibitors of MGST-1. These studies indicate that interactions involving MGST-1 could have implications for leukotriene production and turn-over as well as for the effects or side-effects of drugs which are used in the treatment of asthma.DISCUSSIONPublished binding studies have indicated that MGST-1 contains a binding site for LTC4 (19Metters K.M. Sawyer N. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, radiolabeled LTC4 was reported to bind to purified MGST-1 only if the binding incubations were supplemented with a Triton X-100 extract of dU937 cell membranes (that had been heat-inactivated to abolish endogenous binding sites for LTC4). A lipid component was therefore suggested to be required by purified MGST-1 for binding LTC4 (19Metters K.M. Sawyer N. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies document that a lipid component is not required. Moreover, we discovered that LTC4 was an extremely tight-binding inhibitor of MGST-1. The K iof LTC4 was 5.4 nm for the unactivated enzyme, and 9.2 nm for the NEM-activated enzyme. This agrees well with the previously estimated dissociation constant (19Metters K.M. Sawyer N. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although in our studies divalent cations are not required. In fact, the binding of LTC4 was much stronger than that of GSH itself (K d = 18 μm) (28Sun T.-H. Morgenstern R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The finding that activated and unactivated MGST-1 display similar properties also agrees with previous observations on GSH and glutathione sulfonate binding (28Sun T.-H. Morgenstern R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The activated enzyme did not exhibit an increased affinity for substrates or inhibitory ligands.It was suggested that GSH at physiological concentrations should be able to displace LTC4 from MGST-1 (19Metters K.M. Sawyer N. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study contradicts these findings. The inhibitory capacity of low (near stoichiometric) levels of LTC4 was well evident at 5 mm GSH (c.f. Fig. 1). Thus, physiological levels of GSH (1–10 mm; Ref. 29Cotgreave I.A. Moldeus P. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1986; 13: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) will not effectively displace LTC4 from MGST-1. Rather, the amount of intracellular LTC4 might determine the fraction of MGST-1 available for catalysis. Furthermore, there is no absolute requirement for a lipid environment in order for LTC4 to inhibit MGST-1, as demonstrated by the strong inhibition of purified MGST-1 dissolved in Triton X-100. Differences between the direct binding studies (19Metters K.M. Sawyer N. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and our kinetic data could perhaps be ascribed to some property of the binding assay used.N-acetyl-l-cysteine is a useful analytical alternative to GSH because it is specifically utilized by MGST-1 and not by cytosolic glutathione transferases (30Weinander R. Andersson C. Morgenstern R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 71-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that LTC4 inhibits MGST-1 just as well when this alternative thiol donor is used to assay the enzyme. Therefore, NAC, in conjunction with LTC4 inhibition should provide a helpful tool to determine the amount and activity of MGST-1 in complex biological systems.The binding of LTC4 to MGST-1 was reversible, as demonstrated by the reversibility of inhibition by fatty acid-free albumin. From the competition experiments, it appears likely that LTC4 and GSH bind to the same binding site on MGST-1 and that this site forms part of the active site of the enzyme. However, LTC4 does not compete for the binding of CDNB, indicating that a fatty acid-binding site may be present in the MGST-1 trimer which is different from the hydrophobic substrate-binding site. Another likely explanation is the possibility that CDNB does not form a kinetically significant complex to MGST-1.Previous studies have determined that there is one binding site for GSH per MGST-1 trimer (28Sun T.-H. Morgenstern R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Tight-binding inhibitors can also be used as tools for the evaluation of stoichiometry. LTC4 inhibition measured in the present study indicates that there is one LTC4 binding site per trimer in agreement with direct binding studies with radiolabeled LTC4 (19Metters K.M. Sawyer N. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observed stoichiometry raises important issues regarding the enzymatic mechanism of MGST-1. Spatially equivalent overlapping mutually exclusive sites or non-overlapping sites can be envisioned in the homo-trimeric protein (31Hebert H. Schmidt-Krey I. Morgenstern R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3864-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). If non-overlapping sites are present, conformational information upon binding of GSH or LTC4 has to be transmitted, possibly resulting in alternating site catalysis. Structural studies presently performed are hoped to yield sufficient resolution to address these questions.The high affinity binding of LTC4 to MGST-1 stimulated us to explore whether or not compounds related to LTC4, or drugs which inhibit the leukotriene pathway at different points in the cascade, interfered with MGST-1 activity. Many of the compounds indeed inhibited MGST-1.The antagonists of the receptors for cysteinyl-leukotrienes were potent inhibitors of MGST-1. In particular, the compounds which may be classified as analogues of cysteinyl-leukotrienes (BAY u9773, SKF 104,353, and ONO-1078) were the most potent (Fig.4). The potency of SKF 104,353 was striking, causing 50% inhibition in the submicromolar concentration range, which in fact suggests greater or equal affinity of this compound for MGST-1 in comparison with the CysLT1 receptor (pA2 values for SKF 104,353 against LTD4 in guinea-pig and human airways being 8.6 and 8.0; Ref. 32Hay D.W. Muccitelli R.M. Tucker S.S. Vickery-Clark L.M. Wilson K.A. Gleason J.G. Hall R.F. Wasserman M.A. Torphy T.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 243: 474-481PubMed Google Scholar). For BAY u9773 and ONO-1078, the activity against MGST-1 was also evident in the same concentrations as those required for antagonism of CysLT1receptors. However, there were also discrepancies between the compounds documented relative potency as pharmacological antagonists of the functional responses to cysteinyl-leukotrienes and the potency we observed as inhibitors of MGST-1. For example, the early prototype of CysLT1-antagonists, FPL 55712, was as potent an inhibitor of MGST-1 as the considerably more potent leukotriene antagonist MK-571. Likewise, MK-679, which is the active enantiomer of the racemic compound MK-571, was 5-fold less active than MK-571. Moreover, ICI 198,615, which is the most potent antagonist of CysLT1-receptors among the tested compounds (pA2 values in different systems ranging between 10.1–9.3; Ref. 33Snyder D.W. Giles R.E. Keith R.A. Yee Y.K. Krell R.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 243: 548-556PubMed Google Scholar), failed to cause significant inhibition of MGST-1.Among the inhibitors of leukotriene formation, two relatively selective inhibitors of the 5-lipoxygenase (the iron-chelator zileuton and the active site inhibitor ZD 230,487) failed to inhibit MGST-1, whereas three different FLAP antagonists displayed significant potency as inhibitors (Fig. 4). The prostacyclin analogue piriprost inhibits leukotriene formation by mechanisms that have not been completely elucidated. Interestingly enough, interference with GST activity (34Bach M.K. Brashler J.R. White G.J. Galli S.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) has been discussed as one possible mechanism of its action, and piriprost was found to inhibit MGST-1 in this study.The substrate for leukotriene formation, arachidonic acid, and the immediate precursor of LTC4, LTA4, both inhibited MGST-1, but their effects were only observed at relatively high concentrations. Successive reductions of the glutathionyl side chain in LTC4 yields LTD4 and LTE4. Neither product was particularly potent as inhibitor of MGST-1, which is interesting because LTD4 and LTE4 are presumably formed extracellularly and not in the same compartments as MGST-1 and LTC4.Considered together, the new finding that not only LTC4 but also certain antagonists and inhibitors of leukotrienes inhibited MGST-1 raises a number of questions relating to the function of MGST-1 and related intracellular proteins. There are, as discussed, observations suggesting physical proximity and interactions between FLAP, LTC4 synthase and MGST-1. Our results, in addition, suggest previously unknown functional interactions between MGST-1 on the one hand and enzymes, substrates, products, and cofactors in the leukotriene pathway on the other hand. For example, binding of LTC4 to MGST-1 may represent a means for transient storage of preformed LTC4. Furthermore, binding of LTC4to MGST-1 may reduce product inhibition at the level of LTC4 synthase, which may be desirable at times when there is a strong drive for leukotriene generation. Inhibition of enzymatic activity of MGST-1 by LTC4 is also expected to interfere with the reduction of phospholipid and fatty acid hydroperoxides, which are important cofactors for the synthesis of leukotrienes and several other eicosanoids.All in all, our findings generate the hypothesis that compounds which have some relation to FLAP or LTC4 synthase also may interact with MGST-1. Tight binding of LTC4 by another, cytosolic, GST has also been observed (35Sun F.F. Chau L.Y. Spur B. Corey E.J. Lewis R.A. Austen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8540-8546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, it should be noted that synthesis of LTC4 will take place at the perinuclear membrane (36Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Heibein J.A. Charleson S. Singer I.I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 37Peters-Golden M. McNish R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), which means that intracellular proteins are exposed to LTC4. In addition, transport mechanisms in the cell membrane which share affinity for LTC4 and inhibitors of the leukotriene pathway have been described (38Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27807-27810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we suggest that our observations represent an indication that many different but related proteins must be considered in future equations and schemes attempting to comprehend how leukotrienes are formed and handled in the cell as well as released to the exterior with the aid of transport mechanisms. The observed interactions between LTC4 and MGST-1, and in particular MGST-1 and several leukotriene antagonists, may in addition have bearing on the effects and side-effects of inhibitors of leukotrienes that currently are introduced as new treatment of asthma and other inflammatory diseases. For example, some drugs have caused liver function test abnormalities, and the effects we have observed in this study could well contribute to effects such as peroxisome proliferation that in fact has been documented for some of the drug candidates. The most potent inhibitors of MGST-1 we found could perhaps also be used to probe the role of the enzyme in cellular and organismal detoxication/toxication reactions. For instance, the suggested role for MGST-1 in the protection against oxidative stress (10Mosialou E. Ekström G. Adang A.E.P. Morgenstern R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 1645-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and as the first step in the biotransformation of many nephrotoxic poly-halogenated hydrocarbons (39$$Google Scholar) can be further studied.In conclusion, our findings have shown that LTC4 is a tight-binding inhibitor of MGST-1. This finding suggests an important role of MGST-1 in the intracellular management of LTC4. Future studies will therefore address the role of MGST-1 in the biosynthesis and intracellular transport of LTC4. Glutathione transferases (see Refs. 1Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res.

Adv. Cancer Res. 1979; 29: 175-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). A membrane-bound member of this family has been isolated (6Morgenstern R. Guthenberg C. DePierre J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and named microsomal glutathione transferase-1 (MGST-1).1 This homotrimeric enzyme has a distinct amino acid sequence and immunological properties that are different from its cytosolic counterparts (6Morgenstern R. Guthenberg C. DePierre J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 7DeJong J.L. Morgenstern R. Jörnvall H. Depierre J.W. Tu C.-P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8430-8436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another discriminating property is its ability to be activated (up to 15-fold) by thiol reagents and proteolysis (8Morgenstern R. Lundqvist G. Jörnvall H. DePierre J.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Morgenstern R. DePierre J.W. Ernster L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 87: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). An important function of the enzyme is thought to involve protection of intracellular membranes from oxidative modification as a result of oxidative stress (10Mosialou E. Ekström G. Adang A.E.P. Morgenstern R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 1645-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), through the reduction of phospholipid and fatty acid hydroperoxides (11Mosialou E. Piemonte F. Andersson C. Vos R. Van Bladeren P.J. Morgenstern R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A relationship between MGST-1 and the leukotriene pathway proteins leukotriene (LT) C4-synthase and 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) is indicated by similarities in size, hydropathy, and primary structure (12Weinander R. Ekström L. Raza H. Lundqvist G. Lindkvist B. Sun T.-H. Hebert H. Schmidt-Krey I. Morgenstern R. Vermeulen N.P.E. Mulder G.J. Nieuwenhuyse H. Peters W.H.M. van Bladeren P.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22203-22210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MGST-1 can physically interact with LTC4-synthase (14Surapureddi S. Morgenstern R. Soderstrom M. Hammarstrom S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 15Söderström M. Morgenstern R. Hammarström S. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, additional members of this putative protein superfamily that display common functional properties have recently been described (13Jakobsson P.-J. Mancini J.A. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22203-22210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Jakobsson P.-J. Mancini J.A. Riendeau D. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. J. Biol.

Leukotriene C4-synthase is a specialized membrane-bound glutathione transferase involved in the production of cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4). The cysteinyl leukotrienes are potent proinflammatory mediators that contribute to the pathophysiology of asthma. Hence, drugs which block formation or receptors for cysteinyl-leukotrienes are currently introduced as new therapy in asthma (17$$Google Scholar). LTC4-synthase is homologous to FLAP (18Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 744: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Microsomal GST-1 has been identified as a high capacity “low affinity” binding protein for LTC4 and was found to bind one molecule LTC4 per trimer (19Metters K.M. Sawyer N. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Goffinet A. Nguyen A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 161: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The purified protein did not display binding unless heat-inactivated microsomes had been added, implying the dependence on additional factors. The present study was undertaken to determine whether LTC4 could in fact bind to MGST-1 under physiological conditions and whether such binding would influence the activity of the enzyme. Having established that this was indeed the case, we determined whether other leukotrienes and clinically developed inhibitors of leukotriene formation or receptors also were inhibitors of MGST-1. These studies indicate that interactions involving MGST-1 could have implications for leukotriene production and turn-over as well as for the effects or side-effects of drugs which are used in the treatment of asthma. DISCUSSIONPublished binding studies have indicated that MGST-1 contains a binding site for LTC4 (19Metters K.M. Sawyer N. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, radiolabeled LTC4 was reported to bind to purified MGST-1 only if the binding incubations were supplemented with a Triton X-100 extract of dU937 cell membranes (that had been heat-inactivated to abolish endogenous binding sites for LTC4). A lipid component was therefore suggested to be required by purified MGST-1 for binding LTC4 (19Metters K.M. Sawyer N. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies document that a lipid component is not required. Moreover, we discovered that LTC4 was an extremely tight-binding inhibitor of MGST-1. The K iof LTC4 was 5.4 nm for the unactivated enzyme, and 9.2 nm for the NEM-activated enzyme. This agrees well with the previously estimated dissociation constant (19Metters K.M. Sawyer N. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although in our studies divalent cations are not required. In fact, the binding of LTC4 was much stronger than that of GSH itself (K d = 18 μm) (28Sun T.-H. Morgenstern R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The finding that activated and unactivated MGST-1 display similar properties also agrees with previous observations on GSH and glutathione sulfonate binding (28Sun T.-H. Morgenstern R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The activated enzyme did not exhibit an increased affinity for substrates or inhibitory ligands.It was suggested that GSH at physiological concentrations should be able to displace LTC4 from MGST-1 (19Metters K.M. Sawyer N. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study contradicts these findings. The inhibitory capacity of low (near stoichiometric) levels of LTC4 was well evident at 5 mm GSH (c.f. Fig. 1). Thus, physiological levels of GSH (1–10 mm; Ref. 29Cotgreave I.A. Moldeus P. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1986; 13: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) will not effectively displace LTC4 from MGST-1. Rather, the amount of intracellular LTC4 might determine the fraction of MGST-1 available for catalysis. Furthermore, there is no absolute requirement for a lipid environment in order for LTC4 to inhibit MGST-1, as demonstrated by the strong inhibition of purified MGST-1 dissolved in Triton X-100. Differences between the direct binding studies (19Metters K.M. Sawyer N. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and our kinetic data could perhaps be ascribed to some property of the binding assay used.N-acetyl-l-cysteine is a useful analytical alternative to GSH because it is specifically utilized by MGST-1 and not by cytosolic glutathione transferases (30Weinander R. Andersson C. Morgenstern R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 71-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that LTC4 inhibits MGST-1 just as well when this alternative thiol donor is used to assay the enzyme. Therefore, NAC, in conjunction with LTC4 inhibition should provide a helpful tool to determine the amount and activity of MGST-1 in complex biological systems.The binding of LTC4 to MGST-1 was reversible, as demonstrated by the reversibility of inhibition by fatty acid-free albumin. From the competition experiments, it appears likely that LTC4 and GSH bind to the same binding site on MGST-1 and that this site forms part of the active site of the enzyme. However, LTC4 does not compete for the binding of CDNB, indicating that a fatty acid-binding site may be present in the MGST-1 trimer which is different from the hydrophobic substrate-binding site. Another likely explanation is the possibility that CDNB does not form a kinetically significant complex to MGST-1.Previous studies have determined that there is one binding site for GSH per MGST-1 trimer (28Sun T.-H. Morgenstern R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Tight-binding inhibitors can also be used as tools for the evaluation of stoichiometry. LTC4 inhibition measured in the present study indicates that there is one LTC4 binding site per trimer in agreement with direct binding studies with radiolabeled LTC4 (19Metters K.M. Sawyer N. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observed stoichiometry raises important issues regarding the enzymatic mechanism of MGST-1. Spatially equivalent overlapping mutually exclusive sites or non-overlapping sites can be envisioned in the homo-trimeric protein (31Hebert H. Schmidt-Krey I. Morgenstern R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3864-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). If non-overlapping sites are present, conformational information upon binding of GSH or LTC4 has to be transmitted, possibly resulting in alternating site catalysis. Structural studies presently performed are hoped to yield sufficient resolution to address these questions.The high affinity binding of LTC4 to MGST-1 stimulated us to explore whether or not compounds related to LTC4, or drugs which inhibit the leukotriene pathway at different points in the cascade, interfered with MGST-1 activity. Many of the compounds indeed inhibited MGST-1.The antagonists of the receptors for cysteinyl-leukotrienes were potent inhibitors of MGST-1. In particular, the compounds which may be classified as analogues of cysteinyl-leukotrienes (BAY u9773, SKF 104,353, and ONO-1078) were the most potent (Fig.4). The potency of SKF 104,353 was striking, causing 50% inhibition in the submicromolar concentration range, which in fact suggests greater or equal affinity of this compound for MGST-1 in comparison with the CysLT1 receptor (pA2 values for SKF 104,353 against LTD4 in guinea-pig and human airways being 8.6 and 8.0; Ref. 32Hay D.W. Muccitelli R.M. Tucker S.S. Vickery-Clark L.M. Wilson K.A. Gleason J.G. Hall R.F. Wasserman M.A. Torphy T.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 243: 474-481PubMed Google Scholar). For BAY u9773 and ONO-1078, the activity against MGST-1 was also evident in the same concentrations as those required for antagonism of CysLT1receptors. However, there were also discrepancies between the compounds documented relative potency as pharmacological antagonists of the functional responses to cysteinyl-leukotrienes and the potency we observed as inhibitors of MGST-1. For example, the early prototype of CysLT1-antagonists, FPL 55712, was as potent an inhibitor of MGST-1 as the considerably more potent leukotriene antagonist MK-571. Likewise, MK-679, which is the active enantiomer of the racemic compound MK-571, was 5-fold less active than MK-571. Moreover, ICI 198,615, which is the most potent antagonist of CysLT1-receptors among the tested compounds (pA2 values in different systems ranging between 10.1–9.3; Ref. 33Snyder D.W. Giles R.E. Keith R.A. Yee Y.K. Krell R.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 243: 548-556PubMed Google Scholar), failed to cause significant inhibition of MGST-1.Among the inhibitors of leukotriene formation, two relatively selective inhibitors of the 5-lipoxygenase (the iron-chelator zileuton and the active site inhibitor ZD 230,487) failed to inhibit MGST-1, whereas three different FLAP antagonists displayed significant potency as inhibitors (Fig. 4). The prostacyclin analogue piriprost inhibits leukotriene formation by mechanisms that have not been completely elucidated. Interestingly enough, interference with GST activity (34Bach M.K. Brashler J.R. White G.J. Galli S.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) has been discussed as one possible mechanism of its action, and piriprost was found to inhibit MGST-1 in this study.The substrate for leukotriene formation, arachidonic acid, and the immediate precursor of LTC4, LTA4, both inhibited MGST-1, but their effects were only observed at relatively high concentrations. Successive reductions of the glutathionyl side chain in LTC4 yields LTD4 and LTE4. Neither product was particularly potent as inhibitor of MGST-1, which is interesting because LTD4 and LTE4 are presumably formed extracellularly and not in the same compartments as MGST-1 and LTC4.Considered together, the new finding that not only LTC4 but also certain antagonists and inhibitors of leukotrienes inhibited MGST-1 raises a number of questions relating to the function of MGST-1 and related intracellular proteins. There are, as discussed, observations suggesting physical proximity and interactions between FLAP, LTC4 synthase and MGST-1. Our results, in addition, suggest previously unknown functional interactions between MGST-1 on the one hand and enzymes, substrates, products, and cofactors in the leukotriene pathway on the other hand. For example, binding of LTC4 to MGST-1 may represent a means for transient storage of preformed LTC4. Furthermore, binding of LTC4to MGST-1 may reduce product inhibition at the level of LTC4 synthase, which may be desirable at times when there is a strong drive for leukotriene generation. Inhibition of enzymatic activity of MGST-1 by LTC4 is also expected to interfere with the reduction of phospholipid and fatty acid hydroperoxides, which are important cofactors for the synthesis of leukotrienes and several other eicosanoids.All in all, our findings generate the hypothesis that compounds which have some relation to FLAP or LTC4 synthase also may interact with MGST-1. Tight binding of LTC4 by another, cytosolic, GST has also been observed (35Sun F.F. Chau L.Y. Spur B. Corey E.J. Lewis R.A. Austen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8540-8546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, it should be noted that synthesis of LTC4 will take place at the perinuclear membrane (36Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Heibein J.A. Charleson S. Singer I.I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 37Peters-Golden M. McNish R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), which means that intracellular proteins are exposed to LTC4. In addition, transport mechanisms in the cell membrane which share affinity for LTC4 and inhibitors of the leukotriene pathway have been described (38Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27807-27810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we suggest that our observations represent an indication that many different but related proteins must be considered in future equations and schemes attempting to comprehend how leukotrienes are formed and handled in the cell as well as released to the exterior with the aid of transport mechanisms.

Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 1645-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and as the first step in the biotransformation of many nephrotoxic poly-halogenated hydrocarbons (39$$Google Scholar) can be further studied.In conclusion, our findings have shown that LTC4 is a tight-binding inhibitor of MGST-1. This finding suggests an important role of MGST-1 in the intracellular management of LTC4. Future studies will therefore address the role of MGST-1 in the biosynthesis and intracellular transport of LTC4. Published binding studies have indicated that MGST-1 contains a binding site for LTC4 (19Metters K.M. Sawyer N. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, radiolabeled LTC4 was reported to bind to purified MGST-1 only if the binding incubations were supplemented with a Triton X-100 extract of dU937 cell membranes (that had been heat-inactivated to abolish endogenous binding sites for LTC4). A lipid component was therefore suggested to be required by purified MGST-1 for binding LTC4 (19Metters K.M. Sawyer N. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

In fact, the binding of LTC4 was much stronger than that of GSH itself (K d = 18 μm) (28Sun T.-H. Morgenstern R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The finding that activated and unactivated MGST-1 display similar properties also agrees with previous observations on GSH and glutathione sulfonate binding (28Sun T.-H. Morgenstern R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The activated enzyme did not exhibit an increased affinity for substrates or inhibitory ligands. It was suggested that GSH at physiological concentrations should be able to displace LTC4 from MGST-1 (19Metters K.M. Sawyer N. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study contradicts these findings. The inhibitory capacity of low (near stoichiometric) levels of LTC4 was well evident at 5 mm GSH (c.f. Fig. 1). Thus, physiological levels of GSH (1–10 mm; Ref. 29Cotgreave I.A. Moldeus P. J.

Previous studies have determined that there is one binding site for GSH per MGST-1 trimer (28Sun T.-H. Morgenstern R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Tight-binding inhibitors can also be used as tools for the evaluation of stoichiometry. LTC4 inhibition measured in the present study indicates that there is one LTC4 binding site per trimer in agreement with direct binding studies with radiolabeled LTC4 (19Metters K.M. Sawyer N.

Spatially equivalent overlapping mutually exclusive sites or non-overlapping sites can be envisioned in the homo-trimeric protein (31Hebert H. Schmidt-Krey I. Morgenstern R.

The prostacyclin analogue piriprost inhibits leukotriene formation by mechanisms that have not been completely elucidated. Interestingly enough, interference with GST activity (34Bach M.K. Brashler J.R. White G.J. Galli S.J. Biochem.

Our results, in addition, suggest previously unknown functional interactions between MGST-1 on the one hand and enzymes, substrates, products, and cofactors in the leukotriene pathway on the other hand. For example, binding of LTC4 to MGST-1 may represent a means for transient storage of preformed LTC4. Furthermore, binding of LTC4to MGST-1 may reduce product inhibition at the level of LTC4 synthase, which may be desirable at times when there is a strong drive for leukotriene generation. Inhibition of enzymatic activity of MGST-1 by LTC4 is also expected to interfere with the reduction of phospholipid and fatty acid hydroperoxides, which are important cofactors for the synthesis of leukotrienes and several other eicosanoids. All in all, our findings generate the hypothesis that compounds which have some relation to FLAP or LTC4 synthase also may interact with MGST-1. Tight binding of LTC4 by another, cytosolic, GST has also been observed (35Sun F.F. Chau L.Y. Spur B. Corey E.J. Lewis R.A. Austen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8540-8546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, it should be noted that synthesis of LTC4 will take place at the perinuclear membrane (36Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Heibein J.A. Charleson S. Singer I.I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 37Peters-Golden M. McNish R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), which means that intracellular proteins are exposed to LTC4. In addition, transport mechanisms in the cell membrane which share affinity for LTC4 and inhibitors of the leukotriene pathway have been described (38Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27807-27810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we suggest that our observations represent an indication that many different but related proteins must be considered in future equations and schemes attempting to comprehend how leukotrienes are formed and handled in the cell as well as released to the exterior with the aid of transport mechanisms. The observed interactions between LTC4 and MGST-1, and in particular MGST-1 and several leukotriene antagonists, may in addition have bearing on the effects and side-effects of inhibitors of leukotrienes that currently are introduced as new treatment of asthma and other inflammatory diseases. For example, some drugs have caused liver function test abnormalities, and the effects we have observed in this study could well contribute to effects such as peroxisome proliferation that in fact has been documented for some of the drug candidates. The most potent inhibitors of MGST-1 we found could perhaps also be used to probe the role of the enzyme in cellular and organismal detoxication/toxication reactions. For instance, the suggested role for MGST-1 in the protection against oxidative stress (10Mosialou E. Ekström G. Adang A.E.P. Morgenstern R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 1645-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and as the first step in the biotransformation of many nephrotoxic poly-halogenated hydrocarbons (39$$Google Scholar) can be further studied. In conclusion, our findings have shown that LTC4 is a tight-binding inhibitor of MGST-1. This finding suggests an important role of MGST-1 in the intracellular management of LTC4. Future studies will therefore address the role of MGST-1 in the biosynthesis and intracellular transport of LTC4. Lilian Larsson and Eli Zahou are gratefully acknowledged for practical assistance."

It has been suggested that a fractional domain (helix C) in the amino-terminal region of α-spectrin (Nα region) bundles with another fractional domain in the carboxyl-terminal region of β-spectrin (Cβ region) to yield a triple α-helical bundle and that this helical bundling is largely responsible for tetramer formation. However, there are certain objections to assigning a preeminent role to this helical bundling in the tetramerization reactions. We prepared several recombinant peptides of α-spectrin fragments spanning only the Nα region (lacking the dimer nucleation site) and quantitatively studied their interaction with β-spectrin. We found that a majority of the interactions were localized, as expected, in the Nα-helix C region but that there was also some contribution from the nonhomologous region. More importantly, the temperature and ionic strength dependence of this interaction in our model peptides was different from that in intact spectrin. We suggest that, although the regions involving the putative helical bundling in α- and β-spectrin undoubtedly play a significant role in tetramerization, regions distal to the Nα-helix C region in spectrin are also involved in tetramer formation.

Spectrin is the major component of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton and is thought to be largely responsible for the red blood cell's unique flexibility and deformability (1Bennet V. Lambert S. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1483-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Spectrin is composed of two subunits, α-spectrin (280 kDa) and β-spectrin (246 kDa), which associate to form αβ heterodimers (2Shotton D.M. Burke B.E. Branton D. J. Mol.

The tetramer exists as a flexible rodlike molecule that is anchored to the erythrocyte membrane by interactions with certain membrane proteins, most importantly band 3 and band 4.1 (7Gallagher P.G. Forget B.G. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 4-21PubMed Google Scholar). This spectrin network imparts mechanical stability to erythrocytes. Erythrocyte membranes in patients suffering from hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary elliptocytosis exhibit unusually high mechanical fragility. A large subset of these diseases are known to be the result of defects in spectrin (8Lux S.E. Palek J. Handin R.I. Lux S.E. Stossel T.P. Blood, Principles and Practice of Hematology. J. B.

Chem. 1990; 265: 4434-4443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) sequence analyses show that both α- and β-spectrin are largely composed of multiple homologous motifs of about 106 amino acid residues. These sequence motifs are suggested to fold into triple α-helical bundles (structural domains) with the first and third helices parallel and the intervening second helix antiparallel (14Speicher D.W. Machesi V.T. Nature. 1984; 311: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). This proposed structure is supported by recent x-ray (15Yan Y. Winograd E. Viel A. Cronin T. Harrison S.C. Branton D. Science. 1993; 262: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and NMR (16Pascual J. Pfuhl M. Walther D.A. Saraste M. Nilges M. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10296-10302Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The three helices show a pronounced amphipathic character, and the resulting triple-α-helical bundle structure is thought to be stabilized by the sequestration of the hydrophobic faces of each helix to the interior of the bundle. The initial, antiparallel, side-by-side association of α- and β-spectrin to form αβ dimers occurs at the amino terminus of β-spectrin and the carboxyl terminus of α-spectrin, with high affinity (K d ∼ 10 nm) (20Ursitti J.A. Kotula L. DeSilva T.M. Curtis P.J. Speicher D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6636-6644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This site is referred to as the dimer nucleation site. The rest of the αβ molecule is then thought to associate in a zipper-like fashion (21Speicher D.W. Weglarz L. DeSilva T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14775-14782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two zipped dimers associate at the tetramerization site, the opposite end of the molecule from the dimer nucleation site, resulting in a tetramer molecule (22Ungewickell E. Gratzer W.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 88: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). At this end of the molecule, both the amino-terminal region of α-spectrin (Nα region)1 and the carboxyl-terminal region of β-spectrin (Cβ region) have been shown to encompass fractional 106-amino acid sequence motifs (23Speicher D.W. DeSilva T.M. Speicher K.D. Ursitti J.A. Hembach P. Weglarz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4227-4235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Tse W.T. Lecomte M.C. Costa F.F. Garbarz M. Feo C. Boivin P. Dhermy D. Forget B.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The Nα region contains a nonhomologous sequence, followed by a sequence homologous to that of the third α-helix (helix C) in the motif (15Yan Y. Winograd E. Viel A. Cronin T. Harrison S.C. Branton D. Science. 1993; 262: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). According to our phasing studies with the first domain starting at residue 52 (25Lusitani D.M. Qtaishat N. LaBrake C.C. Yu R.N. Davis J. Kelley M.R. Fung L.W.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25955-25958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the fractional domain is coded for by amino acid residues ∼22–51 of the α-spectrin sequence. We will refer to this fractional motif region as Nα-helix C. It should be noted that there is no direct experimental evidence that this fractional domain is or is not entirely α-helical. This designation is made solely on the basis of primary sequence homology (12Speicher D.W. Davis G. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4938-4947Google Scholar). Similarly, the Cβ region contains a nonhomologous segment and a longer fractional motif homologous to the sequence of the first two α-helices in a complete motif. During the association of two dimers to form tetramers, it has been suggested that the major interaction involves the bundling of the Nα-helix C with the two helices of the Cβ region to yield a triple α-helical bundle (23Speicher D.W. DeSilva T.M. Speicher K.D. Ursitti J.A. Hembach P. Weglarz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4227-4235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Tse W.T. Lecomte M.C. Costa F.F. Garbarz M. Feo C. Boivin P. Dhermy D. Forget B.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This helical bundling hypothesis is bolstered by the fact that the majority of point mutations of spectrin resulting in hereditary elliptocytosis occur in either the Nα-helix C region or the Cβ region with the two helices (10Delaunay J. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 19: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Gallagher P.M. Nathan D.G. Orkin S.H. Hematology of Infancy and Childhood. 5th Ed. W. B.

Invest. 1990; 86: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In most cases, it has been found that these spectrin mutants render unstable tetramers. However, there are certain objections to assigning a preeminent role to this helical bundling association in the tetramerization reactions. One objection can be made on theoretical grounds, based on a proposed structure of spectrin dimer. It has been suggested that in the normal αβ dimer, the longer α-spectrin loops back on itself to form a hairpin type structure to allow the helical bundling to occur (30DeSilva T.M. Peng K. Speicher K.D. Speicher D.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10872-10878Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A more elaborate view of the dimer-tetramer reaction can thus be proposed, as shown in Fig. 1. In this scheme, two Nα/Cβ helical bundles are formed during tetramerization, but two such bundles need to be broken first in each of the hairpin dimers. Thus, the overall process is energetically neutral with respect to helical bundling. Other interactions elsewhere in the molecule must thus be responsible for driving the tetramerization reaction. This is supported by the fact that, although a majority of spectrin point mutations in hereditary anemias that cause impaired tetramer formation are located in the Nα-helix C region, other such mutations are located distal to this region, at residues 260, 469, and 748, for example (7Gallagher P.G. Forget B.G. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 4-21PubMed Google Scholar, 31Baklouti F. Marechal J. Wilmotte R. Alloisio N. Morle L. Ducluzeau M.T. Denoroy L. Mrad A. Ben Aribia M.H. Kastally R. Delaunay J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2464-2470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to examine this conundrum, we produced several well folded recombinant α-spectrin peptides spanning only the Nα region (lacking the dimer nucleation site) and studied their interaction with β-spectrin quantitatively. These systems eliminated the nucleation interaction and the hairpin structure in α-spectrin to allow us to focus on only the helical bundling interaction. We found that a majority of the interactions in our α-spectrin peptides with β-spectrin were attributed to helical bundling in the Nα-helix C region. More importantly, the temperature and ionic strength dependence of our α-peptides binding to β-spectrin was different from that in intact spectrin. We suggest that, although the regions involving the putative helical bundling in α- and β-spectrin undoubtedly play a significant role in tetramerization, regions distal to the Nα-helix C region in spectrin are also involved in tetramer formation. Structural flexibility and lateral interactions in these regions may play a role in spectrin tetramerization. Spectrin dimer was obtained by low ionic strength extraction of erythrocyte ghosts at 37 °C, followed by molecular exclusion chromatography, as described previously (32Menhart N. Mitchell T. Lusitani D. Topouzian N. Fung L.W.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30410-30416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). β-spectrin was obtained from spectrin dimer as before (21Speicher D.W. Weglarz L. DeSilva T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14775-14782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that β-spectrin was purified on the FPLC system using MonoQ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and NaCl gradient. With the proper phasing for domain structure at residue 52 (25Lusitani D.M. Qtaishat N. LaBrake C.C. Yu R.N. Davis J. Kelley M.R. Fung L.W.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25955-25958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we constructed a series of recombinant α-peptides, consisting of the first three complete triple α-helical structural domains (residues 52–368), as well as (a) the entire leading nonhomologous region (residues 1–20) and the Nα-helix C region (residues 21–51) to give peptide Spα-(1–368), (b) half of the nonhomologous region and the entire Nα-helix C region (Spα-(12–368)), (c) only the Nα-helix C region (Spα-(22–368)), (d) half of the Nα-helix C region (Spα-(37–368)), and (e) no Nα-helix C region (Spα-(52–368)). In addition, we also prepared similar peptides with only one (Spα-(1–156)) or two (Spα-(1–262)) complete structural domains. The cDNA encoding the amino terminus of α-spectrin (13Sahr K.E. Laurila P. Kotula L. Scarpa A.L. Coupal E. Leto T.L. Linnenbach A.J. Winkelmann J.C. Speicher D.W. Marchesi V.T. Curtis P.J. Forget B.G. J. Biol.

Pfu polymerase was used under standard conditions to conduct both the polymerase chain reactions (33Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.S.

Stratagene Instructions: Strategies. 1996; 9: 3-4Google Scholar). Fidelity of the polymerase-mediated reactions was subsequently confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Genes encoding for the peptides Spα-(1–368), Spα-(1–262), Spα-(1–156), and Spα-(52–368) were prepared as described previously (25Lusitani D.M. Qtaishat N. LaBrake C.C. Yu R.N. Davis J. Kelley M.R.

The genes encoding for the peptides Spα-(12–368), Spα-(22–368), and Spα-(37–368) were derived from the gene for Spα-(1–368). These peptides were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and released by thrombin cleavage with soluble thrombin (32Menhart N. Mitchell T. Lusitani D.

Purification procedures were as previously discussed (25Lusitani D.M. Qtaishat N. LaBrake C.C. Yu R.N. Davis J. Kelley M.R. Fung L.W.-M. J. Biol.

Peptide identity was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and amino-terminal sequencing (Biocore Facility, University of Notre Dame, South Bend, IN). The molecular masses of these peptides were determined by mass spectrometry using electrospray ionization techniques (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Protein concentrations were determined with absorbance values at 280 nm, using extinction coefficients determined from the primary sequence (32Menhart N. Mitchell T. Lusitani D. Topouzian N. Fung L.W.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30410-30416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether the peptides formed aggregates in buffer solution (5 mm phosphate buffer with 150 mmNaCl at pH 7.4), the solution molecular masses of the peptides at 1–2 mg/ml were determined at 4 °C with an absolute molecular mass determination instrument based on multiangle (15 and 90°) light scattering (PD2000; Precision Detectors, Inc., Amherst, MA) as described previously (32Menhart N. Mitchell T. Lusitani D. Topouzian N. Fung L.W.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30410-30416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Interaction of α-peptides with the β-spectrin was examined by competition experiments using unlabeled peptide to displace125I-labeled peptide bound to β-spectrin. Iodination of α-peptides (100 μg) was performed in 100 mm phosphate at pH 6.5, with IODO-BEAD (three beads; Pierce) and 2 mCi of Na125I (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA), followed by dialysis, three times, against 10 mm Tris buffer at pH 7.4 with 20 mm NaCl and 130 mm KCl (isotonic buffer). A commonly used solid phase assay was applied to study the affinities between various α-peptides with β-spectrin. The isotonic buffer was used as the standard buffer and the temperature of the reaction was 4 °C, unless stated otherwise. In order to validate the binding specificity, we performed initial studies with one of our larger N-terminal peptide fragments, Spα-(1–446) (25Lusitani D.M. Qtaishat N. LaBrake C.C. Yu R.N. Davis J. Kelley M.R. Fung L.W.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25955-25958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and examined it for binding to spectrin dimer and β-spectrin. Wells of a microtiter plate (Immulon-4 from Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) were coated with spectrin dimer or β-spectrin (∼25 μg/ml, 16 h), and unreacted sites were blocked with either bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) or nonfat powdered milk (9% w/v) for 4 h and then washed with the isotonic buffer. A constant amount of125I-Spα-(1–446) (∼0.03 μm; ∼50,000 cpm) was then added to these wells. Unlabeled Spα-(1–446) (10 μm) was added to some wells to compete with the125I-Spα-(1–446), followed by washing with the isotonic buffer containing 6% milk. The amount of125I-Spα-(1–446) remaining in each well was measured with a γ-counter (ICN Micromedic Systems). To ensure sample equilibrium and to optimize the 125I signal, the on and off time constants for this assay (τonand τoff) of an α-peptide (Spα-(1–368)) were also checked. A constant amount of 125I-Spα-(1–368) was added to all wells, and the incubation period was varied from 0.5 to 50 h. The τon was found to be about 10 h−1. We used this value to guide us to determine incubation time to achieve equilibrium. Consequently, a standard incubation time of 16 h was used for the assays. The off rate was also examined to ensure that the equilibrium was not disturbed while washing the microtiter wells. After incubation and washing, buffer was added to the wells containing only the125I-α-peptide and β-spectrin. The mixtures were allowed to remain in the wells for different times, ranging from 1 min to 6.5 h. We found that the dissociation was biphasic with ∼20% coming off with a τoff ∼10 min. The remaining α-peptide (∼80%) came off much more slowly with a τoff > 6 h. Therefore, there was not a significant disturbance of equilibrium during washing, which was accomplished in <1 min. β-Spectrin (∼25 μg/ml; ∼0.1 μm) was added to wells of a microtiter plate for 16 h. Wells were washed, and unreacted sites were blocked with proteins in nonfat powdered milk. Again, the isotonic buffer was used as the standard buffer, and the temperature of the reaction was 4 °C, unless stated otherwise. A constant amount of125I-α-peptide (typically about 100,000 cpm, corresponding to about 0.05 μm), was added to the wells for interactions with the immobilized β-spectrin. Concurrently, unlabeled α-peptide at various concentrations (0–20 μm) was added in isotonic buffer containing 6% milk, and the mixture remained in the well for 16 h. The unlabeled peptide competed with the 125I-labeled peptide for β-spectrin binding sites. The solution was then removed, and the wells were washed three times (in <1 min total time) with the buffer to remove nonbound125I-labeled peptide. The amount of125I-labeled peptide remaining in the wells (cpmbound) was measured and found to decrease with increasing concentrations of unlabeled peptides ([α]). A displacement curve was obtained, and the values of IC50(concentration of unlabeled peptide needed to inhibit/displace 50% of the labeled peptide from binding the β-spectrin) were determined according to the equation (35Segal I.H. Enzyme Kinetics, Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 100-125Google Scholar, 36Chabin R.M. McCauley E. Calaycay J.R. Kelly T.M. MacNaul K.L. Wolfe G.C. Hutchinson N.I. Madhusudanaraju S. Schmidt J.A. Kozarich J.W. Wong K.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9567-9575Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), cpmbound=A0+cpmmax/(1+[α]/IC50)Equation 1 where cpmmax was the amount of labeled peptide bound in the absence of unlabeled α-peptide, and A 0was the nonspecific binding background signal (typically <10% of cpmmax). It was assumed that the β-spectrin concentration in this assay was much less than [α] and IC50. Generally, 3–5 runs were done on at least two separate preparations of β-spectrin and α-peptides, and IC50 values were averaged. For homologous competition experiments, the 125I-labeled and unlabeled peptides were of the same type (e.g. 125I-Spα-(1–368) and unlabeled Spα-(1–368)). For heterologous competition experiments, different unlabeled peptides were used to compete with the binding of 125I-Spα-(1–368) to β-spectrin. The IC50 in Equation 1 is similar to the more common solution dissociation constant (K d) parameter used to characterize binding affinity in solution. Strictly speaking, affinities measured in this assay with one component of the binding reaction immobilized (IC50) are different from the true solution dissociation constants (K d) (37Goldberg M.E. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, these types of affinity studies of soluble species toward solid phase species on microtiter plates (38Finnis M.L. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22817-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 39Zahedi K. J. Biol.

To recognize the different approaches between IC50 and K d measurements, we used the term IC50 for our values, which were very similar to solution phase measurements of Speicher and co-workers (23Speicher D.W.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14788-14793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), when conditions of temperature and ionic strength were matched. This assay can be used to conveniently screen α-peptides with different binding affinities toward the β-spectrin under the same experimental conditions, since large numbers of assays can be set up and analyzed at the same time. In the earlier chromatography-based assays (30DeSilva T.M. Peng K. Speicher K.D. Speicher D.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10872-10878Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), after the samples are incubated for long periods of time to achieve equilibrium, the bound and the free ligand in the system are separated by a column, which takes 30–50 min. In contrast, in this assay, the separation time (washing time) is <1 min. The binding of Spα-(1–368) toward β-spectrin-coated plates was examined as a function of ionic strength and temperature. The assays were conducted at 4 °C in 10 mm Tris at pH 7.4 buffers with varying amounts of added NaCl, ranging from 0 to 1 m, to give different ionic strengths. The ionic strengths of these buffers were calculated, including a ∼7 mm contribution from the 10 mm Tris buffer, resulting in a range of 7–1007 mm. The milk solution used as a protein blocking solution was also dialyzed against the appropriate buffer. In the temperature studies, the samples in isotonic buffer were incubated in the microtiter plates and washed at various temperatures between 0 and 30 °C. The identity of β-spectrin was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel electrophoresis molecular mass was ∼250 kDa. Gel scan analysis of band intensities indicated that the sample was at least 95% pure. Gel electrophoresis molecular masses of the α-peptides were ∼18 kDa for Spα-(1–156), 31 kDa for Spα-(1–262), 43 kDa for Spα-(1–368), 41 kDa for Spα-(12–368), 40 kDa for Spα-(22–368), 39 kDa for Spα-(37–368), and 37 kDa for Spα-(52–368). All seven peptides were also analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry and Edman degradation of the amino terminus. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of Spα-(1–156), Spα-(1–262), Spα-(1–368), Spα-(12–368), Spα-(22–368), Spα-(37–368), and Spα-(52–368) demonstrated that the peptide masses were 18.67, 30.90, 42.93, 41.64, 40.67, 38.70, and 36.92 kDa, respectively, and were within 0.1% of the theoretical molecular masses (18.67, 30.89, 42.94, 41.62, 40.65, 38.69, and 36.92 kDa, respectively). Amino-terminal sequencing (first 10 amino acid residues) of the peptides confirmed that each peptide began with residues GS, which remained from the thrombin cleavage site, and was followed by the correct spectrin residues. The ratios of the solution molecular mass, obtained from light scattering data, to theoretical molecular mass for Spα-(1–156), Spα-(1–262), Spα-(1–368), Spα-(12–368), Spα-(22–368), Spα-(37–368), and Spα-(52–368) in PBS were 0.97, 1.10, 0.97, 1.00, 1.00, 1.20, and 0.97, respectively. These ratios show that most of the peptides in PBS at concentrations of about 1 mg/ml existed as monomer. The Spα-(37–368) peptide appeared to exhibit slight aggregation, since the ratio was about 1.2. The α-peptides were found by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be at least 90% pure. The α-helical contents from CD analysis of Spα-(1–156), Spα-(1–262), Spα-(1–368), Spα-(12–368), Spα-(22–368), Spα-(37–368), and Spα-(52–368) were 57, 73, 76, 74, 75, 69, and 76%, respectively, based on a value of 36,000 for 100% α-helicity (32Menhart N. Mitchell T. Lusitani D. Topouzian N. Fung L.W.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30410-30416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These helicity values indicated that the peptides were all well folded. As shown in Fig.2, in isotonic buffer at 4 °C, upon the addition of unlabeled Spα-(1–446), the amount of125I-Spα-(1–446) bound to spectrin dimer wells (457 ± 148 cpm for wells with Spα-(1–446) and 502 ± 117 cpm for wells without, n = 3) did not vary, whereas the amount of 125I-Spα-(1–446) bound to β-spectrin wells was significantly reduced (1246 ± 373 cpm fo"

This study is the first to identify a catalytic group of the epimerase. ribulose 5-phosphate isoelectric focusing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis xylulose 5-phosphate. Despite its participation in the ubiquitous oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and its concurrent role in the reductive pentose phosphate pathway (i.e. the Calvin cycle) of photosynthetic organisms, d-ribulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.1), which catalyzes the interconversion of Ru5P1 and Xu5P, has not been well-characterized with respect to structure-function relationships. This relative neglect is probably a consequence of low natural abundance of the epimerase and, in the case of the plant enzyme, pronounced instability. We have recently removed these barriers to detailed structural and mechanistic studies by designing a heterologous overexpression system for the gene that encodes spinach chloroplast Ru5P epimerase and by devising a facile purification scheme for the recombinant enzyme that is compatible with its lability (1Chen Y.-R. Hartman F.C. Lu T.-Y.S. Larimer F.W. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The epimerase-catalyzed reaction probably entails a two-base mechanism with an enediolate intermediate (Fig. 1). This supposition is based on the observations that Ru5P formed from [3-2H]Xu5P was completely free of deuterium, even though deuterium was completely retained in the remaining Xu5P (2Davis L. Lee N. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5862-5866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later findings (3Hosomi S. Nakai N. Kogita J. Terada T. Mizoguchi T. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) that isomerization of d-erythrose 4-phosphate to d-erythrulose 4-phosphate by Ru5P epimerase proceeded by intramolecular proton transfer, whereas the C2 proton ofd-threose-4-phosphate formed concurrently by epimerization of d-erythrose-4-phosphate was derived entirely from water, lends additional credence to a two-base mechanism. In Fig. 1, we invoke a general acid to facilitate α-proton abstraction and to stabilize the enediolate intermediate based merely on the prevalence of such groups among mechanistically characterized enzymes, which also abstract α-protons of carbon acids, inclusive of triosephosphate isomerase (4Bash P.A.

The catalytically functional groups depicted in Fig. 1 have not been identified, nor have any residues of Ru5P epimerase even been assigned to the active site. We wish to rectify this situation by applying site-directed mutagenesis to the cloned spinach gene. Because three-dimensional structural information and chemical modification data of Ru5P epimerase are unavailable to guide selections of site-directed mutants, we have assessed comparative sequences and predictive secondary structural analyses for candidate catalytic residues. These assessments prompted scrutiny of Asp186. As reported herein, properties of the D186E, D186N, and D186A mutants of Ru5P epimerase are entirely compatible with a crucial catalytic role for Asp186.

Common laboratory reagents used in conjunction with mutagenesis, expression, and enzyme purification were procured at the highest level of purity readily available. Spinach phosphoribulokinase was prepared as described earlier (12Porter M.A. Milanez S. Stringer C.D. Hartman F.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 245: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Porter M.A. Stringer C.D. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 123-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ru5P epimerase mutants were constructed by use of linear polymerase chain reaction in conjunction with Pfu DNA polymerase (14Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Plasmid pFL506 (GenBank accession number AF070943), which encodes mature wild-type spinach Ru5P epimerase ligated as anNcoI-BamHI fragment adjacent to the tac promoter of expression vector pFL260 (1Chen Y.-R.

Open table in a new tab An overnight culture (25 ml) of the mutant expression vector in host strain MV1190 or XL 1-Blue was grown in 2X-YT medium (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Manniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989: A.3Google Scholar) containing 1% (v/v) glycerol and 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. The culture was diluted 1:100 into the same medium and incubated for 4 h with shaking (250 rpm). Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 0.1 mm, and the incubation was continued for an additional 3 h at 37 °C, at which time the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Mutants were purified by a protocol designed for wild-type Ru5P epimerase, which entails successive chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxyapatite, and MonoQ (1Chen Y.-R. Hartman F.C. Lu T.-Y.S. Larimer F.W. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Processing of ∼10 g of cell paste, harvested from 1-liter cultures of transformed E. coli, typically gave 5–6 mg of the purified mutant. Final preparations (>5 mg/ml) in 10 mmdl-α-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) were stored at −80 °C in the absence of cryoprotectant;dl-α-glycerophosphate was present at all stages of purification to mitigate spontaneous loss of activity (1Chen Y.-R. Hartman F.C. Lu T.-Y.S. Larimer F.W. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Progression of purifications was routinely followed by SDS-PAGE of fractions generated at each step. Because of the inherently low epimerase activity of the mutants, which was overshadowed by the far greater levels from indigenous E. coli Ru5P epimerase, assays of the initial extracts were uninformative. However, becauseE. coli and recombinant spinach Ru5P epimerase are widely separated by DEAE-cellulose in the first chromatographic step of the purification (1Chen Y.-R. Hartman F.C. Lu T.-Y.S. Larimer F.W. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), assays of epimerase activity in fractions collected from this column and at all subsequent steps could be used to monitor D186N and D186E. The paucity of activity associated with D186A precluded reliable activity measurement before concentration of pooled fractions from the final chromatographic step. Similarly to the observed behavior of the wild-type epimerase (1Chen Y.-R. Hartman F.C. Lu T.-Y.S. Larimer F.W. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), each of the mutants was resolved into two peaks by chromatography on MonoQ. The catalytic parameters of the two peaks were indistinguishable. SDS-PAGE was carried out at 15 °C and pH 8.1 on 12.5% (w/v) PhastGels, and nondenaturing PAGE was carried out at 15 °C and pH 8.8 on 8–25% (w/v) gradient PhastGels, in conjunction with a Phast System apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). IEF under denaturing conditions was performed at 15 °C on PhastGel IEF 5-8 as described earlier (1Chen Y.-R. Hartman F.C. Lu T.-Y.S. Larimer F.W. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue according to the supplier's protocol. Protein concentration was determined by a dye binding method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with reagent from Bio-Rad; bovine serum albumin served as the standard for comparison. Ru5P epimerase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by coupling Xu5P formation to NADH oxidation via reactions catalyzed by transketolase, triosephosphate isomerase, and glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (19Kiely M.E. Stuart A.L. Wood T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 293: 534-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Stock preparations of mutants for use in determination of catalytic parameters were centrifuged at 4 °C through a Bio-Spin column (8 × 20 mm) equilibrated with 50 mm Bicine (pH 8.0) to removedl-α-glycerophosphate. If dilutions were required before initiation of enzyme assays, the 50 mm Bicine buffer containing bovine serum albumin at 1 mg/ml was used. Final concentrations of the mutant proteins in the 120-μl assay solutions were 0.01, 0.1, and 5 mg/ml for D186E, D186N, and D186A, respectively; these amounts contrast to 1.2–1.8 ng/ml as were ample to assess wild-type enzyme. Steady-state fluorescence emission spectra were recorded with an SLM-AB2 fluorimeter; excitation and emission bandwidths were set at 4 nm. All measurements were carried out at 25 °C with excitation at 295 nm to selectively excite the indole side chains. Protein samples (0.1 mg/ml withA 295 of ∼0.01) were prepared in 50 mm Bicine (pH 8.0); 8 m urea was included for examination of denatured wild-type epimerase.N-Acetyl-l-tryptophan (5 μm,A 295 of 0.01) in 50 mm Bicine (pH 8.0) was used as a standard for fluorescence emission. Controls lacking protein were used to subtract out background signals. Recorded emission spectra were automatically corrected, because the instrument accounts in real time for wavelength-dependent efficiencies of the light source. NMR spectra were collected at 300K with a wide-bore Bruker AMX 400 MHz spectrometer. One-dimensional1H NMR spectra of samples in D2O (pH 8.0) were collected over a spectral width of 4807 Hz with 32K data points. Proton chemical shifts were referenced to external disodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate. Comparisons of DNA-deduced amino acid sequences of Ru5P epimerases from 16 species, 2Species of Ru5P epimerases that were compared and GenBank accession numbers for their sequences are as follows:Caenorhabditis elegans, U28991; Saccharomyces cerevisiae, P46969; Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Z98979;E. coli, P32661; Serratia marcescens, P45455;Hemophilus influenzae, P44756; Alcaligenes eutrophus, P40117; Spinacia oleracea, AF070943;Solanum tuberosum, Q43157; Synechocystis sp,P74061; Bacillus subtilis, Y13937; Rhodobacter capsulatus, U23145; Mycobacterium tuberculosis, P71676;Helicobacter pylori, P56188; Rhodospirillum rubrum, P51013; and Methanococcus jannashii,Q58093. including representatives from prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and archaea, identify only 25 invariant residues (Fig.2). Among the eight with ionizable side chains (Asp39, Asp44, Asp47, Asp186, His42, His75, His99, and Glu101), Asp186 occurs in the only segment of contiguous invariant residues. When assessed by neural networks for predictions of secondary structure (20Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar, 21Rost B. Sander C. Scheider R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 53-60PubMed Google Scholar), the epimerase sequence describes a series of alternating β-strands and α-helices, compatible with an eight-stranded β/α barrel folding motif. Electrophoretic analyses indicate a high degree of purity of the epimerase mutants, which comigrate with the wild-type enzyme during denaturing (Fig. 3 A) and nondenaturing (Fig. 3 B) PAGE. A pI of 6.6 for the D186A and D186N subunits in contrast to a pI of 6.3 for wild-type and D186E subunits, as determined by denaturing IEF (Fig. 3 C), agrees with the calculated impact of changing the net charge from −4 to −3. The uncharacterized microheterogeneity of the wild-type enzyme, which is observed by nondenaturing IEF (1Chen Y.-R. Hartman F.C. Lu T.-Y.S. Larimer F.W. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), persists with each of the mutants (data not shown). Trp fluorescence has been examined as a diagnostic of conformational integrity of the mutants (Fig. 4). Compared with a typical emission spectrum for Trp that is observed for the wild-type epimerase in the presence of 8 m urea, fluorescence is almost totally quenched under nondenaturing conditions. Likewise, little Trp fluorescence can be detected with the nondenatured mutants. Although each mutant is severely impaired catalytically, sufficient activity remains to quantify k cat and K m of Ru5P (Table II). Only slight increases inK m associated with substitution of Asp by Asn or Glu implicate Asp186 directly in catalysis.Table IIKinetic parameters of spinach recombinant Ru5P epimeraseConstructK mV maxk catk cat/K mmmUnits/mgs −1s −1 m −1Wild type0.221.7 × 1047.1 × 1033.2 × 107D186E0.302.71.13.8 × 103D186N0.280.31.3 × 10−14.5 × 102D186A2.107.8 × 10−43.3 × 10−41.6 × 10−1Experimental details are provided under “Experimental Procedures.” Based on replicate assays, K m andV max values vary by ±10%. Open table in a new tab Experimental details are provided under “Experimental Procedures.” Based on replicate assays, K m andV max values vary by ±10%. The proton resonances of Ru5P and Xu5P, including the doublets reflecting their respective C3 protons, are sufficiently different (Fig. 5, A and B) to allow the epimerase-catalyzed conversion of either compound in D2O to be monitored by 1H NMR. After equilibrium has been reached (Fig. 5 C), the spectra lack the doublet given by the C3 proton of Ru5P or Xu5P, because the C3 proton of substrate is replaced in the product by deuterium from solvent. In the experiments depicted, spectra of 5 mm Ru5P or Xu5P were recorded before and 5 min after the addition of wild-type epimerase to the respective solutions at a final concentration of 2.2 μg/ml. By contrast, the spectra were unaltered by incubation of either substrate for 30 min with D186N at 28 μg/ml. Thus, evidence of preferential retention of proton exchange activity by the mutant, independent of epimerase activity, is lacking. Because of the numerous enzymes that abstract protons α to carbonyl or carboxyl groups, including d-ribose 5-phosphate isomerase that shares a common substrate with Ru5P epimerase and several others that transform substrates structurally similar to Ru5P, we expected to uncover some enzymes with regions of sequence similarity with Ru5P epimerase through data base searches. Somewhat surprisingly, none were found, thereby precluding prospects of extrapolating known active site features from functionally similar enzymes to Ru5P epimerase. However, predictive secondary structural analyses did suggest that the Ru5P epimerase subunit folds into an eight-stranded β/α barrel, as commonly found among isomerases, racemases, and epimerases (22Farber G.K.

In contrast to data base searches for proteins with sequence similarities to Ru5P epimerase, consideration of sequences of the epimerase from evolutionarily diverse sources proved instructive to selecting targets for mutagenesis. Only 8 of the 25 invariant residues have ionizable side chains. One of these, Asp186, is located in the only stretch of 3 contiguous invariant residues that occurs throughout the entire 235-residue polypeptide chain. Furthermore, this location represents the C-terminal end of β-strand 8 of the predicted β/α barrel; most active site residues of proteins having this motif are positioned at the C-terminal ends of β-strands or in interconnecting loops between C termini of β-strands and the N termini of the following helices (22Farber G.K. Petsko G.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 228-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 23Brändén C. Moras D. Drenth J. Strandberg B. Suck K. Wilson K.

Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1991: 43-57Google Scholar). Envisioning Asp186 as one of the two prospective general bases for the abstraction of the C3 proton from either Ru5P or Xu5P or the prospective general acid to assist deprotonation in both the forward and reverse directions of catalysis, we wished to ascertain the consequences of deletion of the aspartyl β-carboxyl group and of substitution with groups that might partially fulfill its normal function. Thus, we characterized the D186A, D186N, and D186E mutants of Ru5P epimerase. Each mutant, which could be purified by the regimen that proved successful for wild-type enzymes, displays the same mobility as the wild-type enzyme during both denaturing and nondenaturing PAGE; thus, the mutant subunits are full-length translation products, which fold and assemble properly into octameric structures akin to wild type. Despite the presence of two tryptophanyl residues (Trp40and Trp182) in each subunit of Ru5P epimerase, fluorescence emission elicited by excitation at 295 nm is barely discernible. Although we have not determined the side chain interactions responsible for the virtually complete quenching of Trp fluorescence, retention of this striking feature by the mutants indicates that their conformations are not perturbed substantially relative to wild type. As judged by the severe impairment of k catvalues of the mutants (2 × 107-fold for D186A, 5.5 × 104-fold for D186N, and 6.5 × 103-fold for D186E), in conjunction with essentially unaltered K m values for Ru5P with D186N and D186E, there can be little doubt that Asp186 of Ru5P epimerase plays a critical role in catalysis. The 10-fold increase in theK m for Ru5P with D186A, in contrast to the wild-type values with the other two mutants, which retain hydrogen binding potential at position 186, is consistent with an interaction between the β-carboxyl of Asp186 and the carbonyl group of bound substrate, as would occur if this residue served as the electrophilic catalyst. The much higher levels of activity associated with D186N and D186E, compared with D186A, are also compatible with Asp186functioning as an electrophile to facilitate abstraction of the α-proton from substrate. The 10-fold greaterk cat of D186E relative to that of D186N might reflect a mechanism whereby the enediolate intermediate is normally stabilized by partial transfer of the active site carboxyl proton to the carbonyl of the intermediate (i.e. formation of a short, strong hydrogen bond), as demonstrated in the case of mandelate racemases (10Landro J.A. Gerlt J.A. Kozarich J.W. Koo C.W. Shah V.J. Kenyon G.L. Neidhart D.J. Fujita S. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11Mitra B. Kallarakal A.T.

Whereas the side chain of Asn could engage the substrate and intermediate through hydrogen bonding, partial proton transfer is unlikely because of the much higher pK aof an amide. If Asp186 rather serves as one of the two bases responsible for α-proton abstraction from substrates, D186N should be as debilitated as D186A; however, it is 400 times more active than the latter and only 10 times less active than D186E. In attempts to further distinguish possible roles of Asp186in electrophilic catalysis versus proton abstraction, we examined the ability of D186N to catalyze exchange of solvent protons with the C3 proton of Ru5P or Xu5P by 1H NMR. In the case of mandelate racemase, replacement of His297, the base that abstracts the α-proton from (R)-mandelate, by Asn eliminates both racemase activity and exchange activity between D2O and (R)-mandelate; however, the H297N mutant catalyzed the exchange reaction between D2O and the α-proton of (S)-mandelate at a rate only 3.3-fold less than observed with wild-type enzyme (11Mitra B. Kallarakal A.T. Kozarich J.W. Gerlt J.A. Clifton J.G. Petsko G.A. Kenyon G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2777-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This observation of stereospecific exchange activity was indeed instrumental in assigning the role of His297. At concentrations of the D186N mutant in D2O that would have readily allowed detection of exchange activity at 0.1% of wild type, the results were totally negative with both Ru5P and Xu5P as substrate. Lack of differential exchange activity, relative to overall epimerase activity, associated with D186N is in accord with Asp186 serving as the electrophile, rather than the base, in facilitation of the initial substrate deprotonation step. Beyond the inherent limitations to interpretation of negative results, a particular caveat pertains to the NMR-based exchange assays. Incorporation of deuterium from D2O into substrate can only occur if the substrate-derived proton, transferred to an enzyme monoprotic base, can exchange with solvent while the deprotonated substrate remains enzyme bound. This precondition may not be met. During the turnover of [3-2H]Xu5P in H2O by wild-type Ru5P epimerase, deuterium is not lost from the remaining pool of unprocessed substrate (2Davis L. Lee N. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5862-5866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, either the substrate-derived proton cannot exchange with solvent while the enediolate intermediate resides at the active site or the protonation of the intermediate by the second base to form product is far more rapid than exchange of protons between the first base and solvent. In conclusion, we have offered rather compelling evidence that Asp186 of Ru5P epimerase contributes directly and profoundly to catalysis. Circumstantial evidence favors Asp186 as the electrophile that facilitates α-proton abstraction by either of the general base catalysts, but its identity as one of the two bases cannot be rigorously excluded. Future studies of solvent and substrate isotope effects may clarify this issue. We gratefully acknowledge the expert technical assistance of Tse-Yuan S. Lu and Alice A. Hardigree."

Through its interaction with its integrin counter receptor, very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), it mediates cell-cell interactions, which have been shown to be involved in recruitment of mononuclear leukocytes to the vascular lesions observed in early atherosclerosis. VCAM-1 and VLA-4 are also implicated during skeletal muscle myogenesis and developing central nervous system on neuroepithelial cells in embryogenesis (4Rosen G.D. Sanes J.R. LaChance R.

In the vascular system, VCAM-1 is expressed in human SMCs during embryonic development and in atherosclerotic plaques, and it colocalizes with VLA-4 (7O'Brien K.D. Allen M.D. McDonald T.O. Chait A.

Dufourcq P. Llanas B. Moreau C. Bonnet J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). VCAM-1-deficient mice embryos have been shown to have an abnormal placental development in which the allantois failed to fuse to the chorion, and they displayed abnormalities in their developing hearts (9Kwee L. Baldwin H.S. Shen H.M. Stewart C.L. Buck C. Buck C.A. Labow M.A. Development. 1995; 121: 489-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gurtner G.C. Davis V. Li H. McCoy M.J. Sharpe A. Cybulsky M.I. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In vitro, VCAM-1 is induced in SMCs after cytokine stimulation (11Li H. Cybulsky M.I. Gimbrone M.A. Libby P. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1551-1559PubMed Google Scholar, 12Couffinhal T. Duplàa C. Moreau C. Lamazière J.M.D. Bonnet J. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It is also coinduced with SMC marker proteins during SMC differentiation in vitro, and treatment with antibodies against VCAM-1 or its ligand VLA-4 has been found to interfere with the expression of mRNA of smooth muscle-specific markers during redifferentiation (8Duplàa C. Couffinhal T. Dufourcq P. Llanas B. Moreau C. Bonnet J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, VCAM-1 seems to be expressed and involved during smooth muscle differentiation. Investigation of mechanisms controlling its expression should provide some insight into specific gene regulation in vascular smooth muscle during differentiation. Studies on the activity of the VCAM-1 gene promoter have shown that in endothelial cells, TNF-α induction of VCAM-1 is dependent on two adjacent κB sites located at positions −77 and −63 relative to the single transcriptional start site (13Iademarco M.F. McQuillan J.J. Rosen G.D. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16323-16329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Neish A.S. Williams A.J. Palmer H.J. Whitley M.Z. Collins T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1583-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). These κB elements are also important for VCAM-1 induction in the embryonic carcinoma cell line P19 stimulated to differentiate along a neural pathway by treatment with retinoic acid (6Sheppard A.M.

Thus, these previous works suggested that NF-κB proteins could be involved in the VCAM-1 expression in SMCs. NF-κB proteins belong to the Rel protein family, transcriptional regulatory proteins, including p65 (RelA), RelB, p52/100 (NF-κB1), p50/p105 (NF-κB2), v-Rel, and the product of the c-rel proto-oncogene (15Schmid R.M.

Invest. 1995; 96: 2521-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) have described a novel NF-κB member termed SMC-Rel, essential for proliferation of cultured bovine vascular SMCs. In most unstimulated cell types, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm complexed with an inhibitory protein, I-κB, in a non-DNA-binding form (21Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). Stimulation of cells with cytokines (22Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar) results in the release of NF-κB complex from I-κB and its translocation into the nucleus, where it transcriptionally regulates the expression of a wide variety of genes through specific κB elements (23Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of the NF-κB/Rel family is controlled at different levels, e.g. by the different combination of NF-κB/Rel dimers formed, and the sequence of κB sites recognized by them. In this study, the role of NF-κB in VCAM-1 expression during SMC differentiation was compared with that induced by TNF-α. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) failed to detect any induction of NF-κB/Rel protein binding activity on κB binding sites on the human VCAM-1 gene promoter in differentiated SMCs, although it was observed in TNF-α-activated SMCs. Addition of the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), inhibitor of NF-κB/Rel activity (23Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar, 24Schreck R. Meier B.

These results indicate that NF-κB/Rel proteins are not involved in VCAM-1 gene expression during SMC differentiation. Recombinant human TNF-α was provided by Genzyme, Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Murine monoclonal antibody directed against human VCAM-1 (monoclonal antibody 1G11, diluted 1:50) was purchased from Immunotech. Anti-human smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (sm-MHC) monoclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. M. Glukhova (25Frid M.G. Shekhonin B.V. Koteliansky V.E. Glukhova M.A. Dev.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to NF-κB/rel family member p50 and p65 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA; diluted 1:200). SMCs were isolated from media of human thoracic aortas by enzyme digestion as described previously (26Thyberg J. Palmberg L. Nilsson J. Ksiazek T. Sjölund M. Differentiation. 1983; 25: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). SMCs were cultured in Ham's F-10 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 5% heat-inactivated human serum, 5 mm HEPES, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin, at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. Studies were conducted on SMCs at passage two, seeded at a high seeding density (5 × 104 cells/cm2). In order to obtain the different phenotypes of SMCs (undifferentiated or differentiated), we used various culture conditions (8Duplàa C. Couffinhal T. Dufourcq P. Llanas B. Moreau C. Bonnet J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27Libby P. O'Brien K.V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 115: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 28Owens G.K. Loeb A. Gordon D. Thompson M.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). At confluence, the cells were either maintained undifferentiated in medium supplemented with serum, or induced to differentiate in a defined serum-free medium containing a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Ham's F-10 plus insulin (10−6m, Sigma), transferrin (200 μg/ml, Sigma), ascorbate (0.2 mm, Sigma), and sodium selenite (6.25 ng/ml, Sigma). These conditions designed to induce redifferentiation were usually maintained for 6 days. However, for time-course or inhibition experiments, as some smooth muscle markers and VCAM-1 mRNA were rapidly induced within day 1 in defined serum-free medium (8Duplàa C. Couffinhal T. Dufourcq P. Llanas B. Moreau C. Bonnet J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), cells were used 1, 6, or 24 h after the switch of medium. In order to obtain a VCAM-1 cytokine-induced expression in the absence of any redifferentiation process, confluent SMCs maintained for 6 days in serum-supplemented medium, were treated with TNF-α (1000 units/ml) 24 h before analysis. In order to inhibit NF-κB activity, cells were treated with PDTC (Sigma) at a final concentration of 100 μm. Initially the confluent cells were pretreated for 1 h with PDTC, and then maintained in culture for an additional 24 h in the presence of PDTC and either TNF-α in medium plus serum or in serum-free medium. Cells maintained in serum and treated for 25 h with PDTC were used as control. The effect of PDTC on SMCs viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion; less than 5% cell mortality was observed. The well plates were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and RNAs were extracted and analyzed by RT-PCR. SMCs were grown in Lab-Tek two-well chambers (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL), then rinsed with PBS, fixed, and permeabilized with cold methanol for 10 min. Cells were incubated with primary and secondary antibodies in BSA/PBS 1% for 1 h. For sm-MHC detection, the secondary antibody, a biotin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG from sheep (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, diluted 1:100), and the streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (RPN 1051, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, diluted 1:100) were applied. For NF-κB/Rel family protein labeling, the secondary antibody, a biotin-conjugated, anti-rabbit donkey IgG (diluted 1:100), and the streptavidin-Texas Red complex (RPN 1223, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, diluted 1:100) were used. For flow cytometric analysis, monodispersed suspensions of SMCs were prepared by brief incubations in buffer (6 mm glucose, 5.3 mm KCl, 125 mmNaCl, 18 mm Hepes, 1× PBS, and 0.2 mm EDTA) at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated with 50 μl of monoclonal antibody against human VCAM-1 in 2% BSA/PBS for 30 min in ice. After washing, cells were treated with sheep anti-mouse Ig, fluorescein-linked whole antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min in ice, washed three times, and resuspended in 500 μl of PBS. The samples were analyzed in a Coulter type XL flow cytometer. Total cellular RNA was prepared using a single-step acid guanidium isothiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method (29Chomczynski P.

In order to verify the specificity of generated PCR products, hybridizations were performed with specific probes for VCAM-1 and sm-MHC, or with an internal oligonucleotide for G3PDH after Southern transfer (31Beg A.A.

For human sm-MHC probe, human sm-MHC cDNA was amplified by PCR for 30 cycles at 60 °C for annealing using primers as described elsewhere (8Duplàa C. Couffinhal T. Dufourcq P. Llanas B. Moreau C. Bonnet J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The PCR product obtained was purified, digested in a 392-bp fragment, and subcloned into pBluescript plasmid according to standard procedures. The specificity of the PCR product was ensured by the DNA sequence determined by the dideoxy chain-termination method with modified T7 DNA polymerase. The VCAM-1 and sm-MHC cDNA fragments were labeled by random priming with the kit Ready-To-Go (Biolabs). Hybridization was done at 42 °C overnight in the presence of 106 cpm/ml in buffer 50% (v/v) formamide, 4× SSC, 10× Denhardt's solution (1× Denhardt's solution is 0.02% polyvinyl pyrrolidone, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% BSA), 0.1% SDS, and sheared denatured salmon sperm DNA at 0.4 mg/ml. Filters were washed in 2× SSC for 10 min at room temperature, followed by two washes in 0.1× SSC for 30 min at 55 °C. Filters were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film with an intensifying screen. Preparation of nuclear extracts was based on the methodologies described by Li and Schreiber (32Li Z. Paulin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10403-10415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). The cultured cells (approximately 2 × 107cells) were washed with cold PBS and harvested after trypsin treatment. The cells were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 800 μl of cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine). The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, then 25 μl of a 10% solution of Nonidet P-40 was added to release the nuclei. Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of buffer B (10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 50 mmNaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.5 mmspermidine, 0.15 mm spermine) in the presence of protease inhibitors (pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, antipain, and chymostatin at 5 μg/ml, 1 mm Pefabloc, 2 mm benzamidine) and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The nuclear pellet was recovered by centrifugation, and nuclear proteins were extracted by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C in 100 μl of buffer C (the same as buffer B except 400 mm NaCl). The nuclear extract was centrifuged at 13,500 rpm for 40 min, and the supernatant was dialyzed three times against 250 ml of buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 50 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm benzamidine) for 1 h. Nuclear extracts were stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad kit) (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). In order to prepare double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the upstream κB elements of human VCAM-1 gene, synthetic complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed and then purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel-purified double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled on their 5′ ends with [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and used as probes in EMSA. Oligonucleotides were chosen according to Iademarco et al. (13Iademarco M.F. McQuillan J.J. Rosen G.D. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16323-16329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide κB corresponds to the two wild-type κB sites (boldface) taken from the DNA sequence located at bp −77 to 63 of the VCAM-1 gene promoter: CTGCCCTGGGTTTCCCCTTGAAGGGATTTCCCTCCGCCT. Oligonucleotide κBM was identical to κB wild type sites except for 4 nucleotide mutations (underlined) in each of the two NF-κB-DNA binding sites according to Marui et al. (35Marui N. Offermann M.K.

An oligonucleotide (YY1) corresponding to a probe for another transcription factor was used in competition experiments to ensure the specific κB DNA binding activity with NF-κB proteins: TCTGTCTCCATTTTTTCTCT. EMSA were performed with 25 μl of binding mixture containing 1 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC), 40 fmol of 32P-labeled annealed κB oligonucleotides, 8 μg of nuclear extract in 12 mm HEPES, pH 8, 50 mm KCl, 12% glycerol, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, 0.12 mm EDTA, 1.2 mm benzamidine. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and DNA-protein complexes were resolved by non-denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis in 5% acrylamide, employing 0.022 m Tris borate, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8, as buffer. Following electrophoresis, gels were dried and DNA-protein complexes were localized by autoradiography. Competition studies were performed by adding unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides to the binding reaction. In order to determine the role of the NF-κB/Rel protein family in VCAM-1 expression in SMCs, we used an in vitro model of SMC phenotypic modulation. Concerning the modulation of differentiation process, we analyzed the protein and mRNA levels of sm-MHC, a marker of the fully differentiated phenotype of SMCs (36Larson D.M. Fujiwara K. Alexander R.W. Gimbrone M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1582-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 37Nagai R. Larson D.M. Periasamy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In 6-day post-confluent cells, maintained in medium with serum, a faint immunostaining for sm-MHC was observed, suggesting a dedifferentiated phenotype (Fig. 1, S). When these post-confluent cells in medium with serum were stimulated for 24 h with TNF-α, the same low expression of sm-MHC was observed (Fig. 1, T), showing the lack of effect of TNF-α on SMC differentiation. On the other hand, when the confluent cells were cultured for 6 days in the defined medium without serum, a strong immunostaining for sm-MHC was noted, indicative of redifferentiation (Fig. 1, D). Analysis of mRNA content by RT-PCR and Southern transfer revealed a low level of sm-MHC mRNA in cells cultured in medium with serum that was stimulated or not stimulated with TNF-α (Fig. 2). In SMCs cultured in defined serum-free medium, a high level of sm-MHC mRNA was detected (Fig. 2). In this in vitro model, VCAM-1 expression showed a different pattern to that of sm-MHC. Flow cytometry and RT-PCR analysis showed that SMCs maintained in medium with serum had a low level of VCAM-1 protein and mRNA (TableI and Fig. 2). However, administration for 24 h with TNF-α or cultivation in defined serum-free medium for 6 days induced an increase in protein and mRNA content of VCAM-1 (Table I and Fig. 2). These results showed that VCAM-1 expression was increased in two conditions, either by cytokine treatment in SMCs expressing low levels of sm-MHC, or by medium switch inducing redifferentiation characterized by a high level of sm-MHC expression. These results suggested that VCAM-1 was induced in two different cell populations, in TNF-α-stimulated undifferentiated SMCs and in redifferentiated SMCs.Figure 2Southern blot analysis of VCAM-1 and sm-MHC mRNA expression in SMC redifferentiation model. One μg of total RNA obtained from post-confluent SMCs cultured in medium supplemented with serum for 6 days, activated (T) or not (S) with 1000 units/ml TNF-α for 24 h, and from post-confluent SMCs cultured in a defined serum-free medium for 6 days (D) were used for RT-PCR analysis. Ten μl of DNA amplified product were analyzed in 1.5% agarose gel and transferred on nitrocellulose membrane. Hybridizations with specific end-labeled probes were used to ensure specificity of amplified products. DNA probes are described under “Materials and Methods.” G3PDH, used as internal control, VCAM-1, and sm-MHC mRNA expression were analyzed in the three conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IVCAM-1 protein expression in the in vitro model of SMC redifferentiationImmunofluorescence flow cytometry dataCorrected mean fluorescenceNormalizedarbitrary unitsSerum48.51TNF-α132.92.74Defined serum-free medium112.52.32Human undifferentiated serum-cultured SMCs (Serum), undifferentiated TNF-α-stimulated SMCs (TNF-α), and redifferentiated SMCs (Defined serum-free medium) were immunolabeled with anti-VCAM-1 monoclonal antibody (1G11).

Open table in a new tab Human undifferentiated serum-cultured SMCs (Serum), undifferentiated TNF-α-stimulated SMCs (TNF-α), and redifferentiated SMCs (Defined serum-free medium) were immunolabeled with anti-VCAM-1 monoclonal antibody (1G11). A fluorescent secondary antibody was applied, and 5,000 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Mean fluorescence obtained with no antibody was subtracted from the values obtained with specific antibody. Values are means of three independent experiments. In order to determine the cellular distribution of NF-κB/Rel proteins in SMCs, the immunostaining of the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB complex was studied in SMCs cultured under different conditions at 6 days (Fig.3 a). p65 and p50 were found in the nuclei of both undifferentiated SMCs cultured in serum and in TNF-α-treated SMCs (Fig. 3 a, S andT, respectively). However, in contrast with the strong labeling of the cytokine-stimulated nucleus, a fainter nuclear staining and a persistent cytoplasmic labeling was observed in cells maintained only in medium with serum. In contrast, only a cytoplasmic labeling of the p50 and p65 subunits with no nuclear staining was observed in differentiating SMCs cultured in defined serum-free medium (Fig.3 a, D). This suggested that NF-κB proteins were translocated to the nucleus when SMCs were cultured in medium supplemented with serum or stimulated by TNF-α. This p50 and p65 protein translocation was not observed in redifferentiated SMCs. In order to exclude an early involvement of NF-κB system in VCAM-1 expression during SMC redifferentiation process, we analyzed the time course of p50 Rel protein translocation in our culture model (Fig.3 b). As the result obtained after 6 days, we observed a weak p50 subunit staining into nucleus of SMCs maintained in serum. After TNF-α stimulation, a slight p50 nuclear staining was evident at 1 h (Fig. 3 b, T). A maximal positive nucleus labeling was seen after 6 h of TNF-α stimulation and was maintained for 24 h (Fig. 3 b, T). In redifferentiated SMCs, maintained in serum free-medium, we did not observe any nucleus staining but only a cytoplasmic labeling (Fig.3 b, D). These results seemed to confirm the non-involvement of NF-κB proteins in redifferentiated SMC VCAM-1 expression. EMSA was employed in an attempt to find out whether nuclear proteins interact specifically with κB elements of the VCAM-1 gene promoter. Nuclear extracts of SMCs harvested in the three culture conditions described above were incubated with a double-stranded end-labeled oligonucleotide probe extending from position −88 to −56 of the human VCAM-1 promoter. As shown in Fig.4, the nuclear extract of undifferentiated SMCs cultured in medium with serum (S) formed one DNA-protein complex (B1) with the probe. The complex was competed with a 10–50-fold molar excess of unlabeled κB oligonucleotide, whereas addition of a 50-fold molar excess of an unrelated YY1 oligonucleotide, or a 10–50-fold molar excess of the mutated κBM oligonucleotide did not compete, indicating the specificity of this binding. Nuclear extracts from undifferentiated TNF-α-stimulated SMCs (T) formed two specific DNA-protein complexes (B1 and B2 complexes) with the labeled κB probe. Competition experiments demonstrated the specificity of the two DNA-protein complexes. On the other hand, EMSA with nuclear proteins from differentiated SMCs (D) showed no specific DNA-protein complex. These results showed that the presence of serum was associated with the presence of the B1 complex, TNF-α stimulation inducing the appearance of the B2 complex. These complexes seemed to disappear in culture in defined serum-free medium, which induced rediff"
https://openalex.org/W2032190743,"N-Deacetylase-N-sulfotransferases (NDANST) catalyze the two initial modifications of the polysaccharide precursor in the biosynthesis of heparin and heparan sulfate. These modifications are the gating steps in establishing growth factor protein-binding domains of these glycosaminoglycans. We have undertaken a structure-activity analysis of the 841-amino acid Golgi-luminal portion of the rat liver NDANST to localize the two enzymatic functions. Each activity can be assayed in vitroindependently of the other when provided with the appropriate substrate, and N-ethylmaleimide treatment selectively inactivates the deacetylase activity. In this study, dithiothreitol treatment of the rat liver NDANST was shown to inactivate the sulfotransferase function, while stimulating deacetylase activity 2–3-fold over the native protein. Site-directed mutagenesis of the eight cysteine (Cys) residues in the rat liver NDANST that are conserved in the mouse mastocytoma protein produced three important findings regarding the localization of each enzymatic function: 1) derivatization of Cys486 with N-ethylmaleimide resulted in total inactivation of the deacetylase activity based on steric hindrance of the active site (this residue was shown not to be involved in enzymatic catalysis), 2) substitution of either Cys159 or Cys486 with alanine resulted in enhanced activity of the deacetylase to the level obtained by dithiothreitol treatment, and 3) alanine substitution of Cys818 or Cys828 completely inactivated the sulfotransferase activity, while substitution of Cys586 or Cys601 resulted in a 90% loss in activity. These findings suggest that the two enzymatic domains within the NDANST localize to different portions of the protein, with two disulfide pairs toward the COOH-terminal half of the protein necessary for the sulfotransferase activity, and Cys residues within the NH2-terminal half influencing or located near the active site of the deacetylase functionality."
https://openalex.org/W2083875166,"Among the glycoprotein hormone receptors, only the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) cleaves (at two sites) into disulfide-linked A and B subunits. A 50-amino acid insertion unique to the TSHR ectodomain (residues 317–366) plays no role in ligand binding or signal transduction, but its deletion abrogates cleavage at Site 1, closely upstream of the insertion. We sought to define the region within the 50-amino acid tract involved in TSHR cleavage at Site 1. Mutation of small segments within this region previously failed to prevent cleavage at Site 1. We, therefore, divided the 50-amino acid insertion into quartiles and deleted each one individually (TSHR residues 317–327, 328–338, 339–350, and 351–362). As determined by covalent cross-linking of 125I-TSH to intact cells expressing the mutant receptors, none of these deletions prevented TSHR cleavage at Site 1. Neither did larger deletions of quartiles 1 + 2, 2 + 3, and 3 + 4. However, qualitative differences in the extent of receptor cleavage suggested that quartiles 1 and 4 were playing a greater role in cleavage at Site 1 than were the middle two quartiles. In support of this hypothesis, deletion of these two discontinuous segments almost completely eliminated TSHR cleavage at Site 1.In conclusion, intramolecular cleavage at Site 1 requires the presence of the N-terminal and C-terminal quartiles of the 50-amino acid insertion unique to the TSHR.

Three unusual features distinguish the thyrotropin (TSH)1 receptor from the other glycoprotein hormone receptors. First, stimulating autoantibodies mimic the action of its ligand TSH and cause Graves' disease, one of the most common autoimmune diseases affecting humans (reviewed in Ref.1Rapoport B. Chazenbalk G.D. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 673-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Second, a variable proportion of TSH receptors (TSHR) on the cell surface cleave into two subunits (A and B) that remain linked by disulfide bonds (2Furmaniak J. Hashim F.A. Buckland P.R. Petersen V.B. Beever K. Howells R.D. Rees Smith B. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 3Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Seto P. Rapoport B.

A. 1992; 89: 3765-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Intramolecular cleavage of the TSHR occurs at two separate sites with the loss of a putative polypeptide fragment (C peptide) (5Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Finally, relative to the other glycoprotein hormone receptors, the TSHR contains an insertion of 50 amino acids in the vicinity of residues 317–366 (low homology makes the exact boundaries difficult to define). This insertion, bordered by cysteine residues and with characteristics of an hydrophilic external loop, can be deleted without affecting ligand and autoantibody binding and receptor activation (6Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Russo D. Rapoport B. Science. 1990; 249: 1423-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Whether all three of these features are inter-related is an important unanswered question that may yield clues regarding the pathogenesis of Graves' disease. Characterization of the mechanism and sites of TSHR cleavage is, therefore, of pathophysiologic interest. There is evidence that TSHR cleavage (at an undetermined site) involves a matrix metalloprotease (7Couet J. Sar S. Jolivet A. Vu Hai M.-T. Milgrom E. Misrahi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4545-4552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The putative TSHR C peptide has not been isolated or characterized, possibly because it is degraded. Recently, a direct association between TSHR cleavage and the 50-amino acid insertion has been found. Thus, cleavage at Site 1 is dependent upon and appears to occur closely upstream of, this 50-residue tract (8Tanaka K. Chazenbalk G.D. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1959-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, there is no specific motif for cleavage at Site 1 in that every amino acid in this region can be replaced without abrogating cleavage. Cleavage at Site 2, which also lacks a specific motif, is not dependent on the 50-amino acid insertion but can be prevented by replacing TSHR amino acid residues 367–369 with the N-linked glycosylation motif at the corresponding location in the noncleaving lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor (9Kakinuma A.

In the present study, we sought to define the region within the 50-amino acid insertion involved in TSHR cleavage at Site 1. Surprisingly, we found that almost the entire tract needs to be present for cleavage to occur. However, cleavage is most dependent on the N-terminal and C-terminal quartiles of the 50-amino acid segment. Because there is no amino acid specificity at the cleavage site itself, our data suggest that the 50-amino acid insertion in the TSHR may function as a discontinuous binding site for a protease that clips the TSHR at Site 1. All the following deletion mutations were introduced into a TSHR unable to cleave at Site 2 (GQE367–369NET) (9Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol.

DNA fragments containing these deletions were generated by polymerase chain reaction using overlapping primers andPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) or, when necessary, Amplitaq Gold (Perkin-Elmer). Templates were plasmids containing the cDNA for the wild-type TSHR modified by the introduction of three restriction sites (10Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Russo D. Seto P. Rapoport B.

The nucleotide sequences of the polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments, and adjacent restriction sites were confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide termination method (12Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The construction of TSHR with deletion of residues 317–366 and the GQE367–369NET substitution (TSHR Δ317–366-NET) has been described previously (6Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Russo D.

Cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (fetal calf serum), penicillin (100 units/ml), gentamicin (50 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (2.5 μg/ml) Confluent 100-mm diameter dishes of TSHR-expressing cells were incubated for 2.5 h at 37 C with ∼5 μCi of 125I-TSH followed by cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate (1 mm, Sigma) and processing as described previously in detail (5Chazenbalk G.D.

After the addition of Laemmli sample buffer (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) containing 0.7 mβ-mercaptoethanol (30 min at 50 °C), the samples were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). Prestained molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were included in parallel lanes. We precalibrated these markers against more accurate unstained markers to obtain the molecular weights indicated in the text. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography on Biomax MS x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Deletion of the entire TSHR 50 amino acid insertion (residues 317–366) (8Tanaka K.

On this basis, we reasoned that deleting intermediate length blocks of amino acid residues would broadly localize the region involved in Site 1 and would then allow us to focus on smaller segments. We, therefore, divided the 50-amino acid insertion into quartiles and deleted each one individually (TSHR residues 317–327, 328–338, 339–350, and 351–362). Four residues (363–366) most distal to cleavage Site 1 were left intact to preserve a restriction site necessary for plasmid constructs. However, previous studies on chimeric TSH-LH/CG receptors indicated that deletion of the 46 N-terminal residues was sufficient to prevent cleavage at Site 1 (9Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28296-28300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because of the presence of two cleavage sites, to be informative (readout of a noncleaving receptor), deletions were performed on a background of a TSHR mutant (GQE367–369NET) in which cleavage at the more downstream Site 2 is eliminated (9Kakinuma A.

Contrary to expectations, the sequential deletion of each of the four quartiles in the TSHR 50-amino acid insertion (Fig. 1 A) did not prevent TSHR cleavage into two subunits. Thus, covalent cross-linking of 125I-TSH to monolayers of intact CHO cells expressing these deletion mutants revealed complexes of ligand with both single polypeptide chain (uncleaved) and two subunit (cleaved) receptors (Fig.1 B). Based on the above results, we turned to larger, rather than smaller, deletions in the TSHR 50-amino acid insertion. For this purpose we constructed three TSHR with deletions of quartiles 1 and 2 (amino acid residues 317–338), quartiles 2 and 3 (residues 328–350), and quartiles 3 and 4 (residues 339–362) (Fig.2 A). Again, all deletions were made on a background of a receptor with the mutation (GQE367–369NET) that eliminates cleavage at Site 2. As with the smaller deletions, radiolabeled TSH cross-linking to the surface of intact cells indicated that none of these much larger deletions prevented TSHR cleavage at Site 1 (Fig. 2 B). At this juncture, on re-evaluating data from repeated experiments showing an inability to prevent cleavage at Site 1, we noted that there appeared to be quantitative differences in the degree of TSHR cleavage occurring with the different deletions (see for example Figs. 1 and 2). Densitometric analysis confirmed this impression (Fig.3). Thus, deletion of the middle two quartiles (residues 328–350) had no effect on the ratio of uncleaved to cleaved receptors relative to the TSHR without deletions. In contrast, deletion of either quartiles 1 and 2 (residues 317–338) or quartiles 3 and 4 (residues 339–362) significantly reduced the extent of TSHR cleavage into two subunits (p < 0.025 andp < 0.05, respectively). These data suggested that quartiles 1 and 4 were playing a greater role in cleavage at Site 1 than were the middle two quartiles. To test this hypothesis, we generated a new TSHR with deletions of discontinuous quartiles 1 and 4 (residues 317–327 and 351–362) (Fig.4 A). In confirmation of this hypothesis, the effect of these two discontinuous deletions was to almost completely eliminate TSHR cleavage at Site 1 (Fig.4 B). As observed previously with deletion of the entire 50-amino acid segment (8Tanaka K. Chazenbalk G.D. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1959-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), prevention of cleavage at Site 1 by outer quartile deletion is not absolute, with a trace of cleaved receptor still being evident. Only the TSHR, and not the other closely related glycoprotein hormone receptors, undergoes proteolytic cleavage at the cell surface. However, mutagenesis studies have been unable to define a specific amino acid motif at either of the two cleavage sites in the TSHR ectodomain (8Tanaka K. Chazenbalk G.D. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1959-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28296-28300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). TSHR cleavage must, therefore, be caused by a proteolytic enzyme with relaxed specificity at its catalytic site yet which interacts preferentially with the TSHR and not with the other glycoprotein hormone receptors. This likelihood is supported by evidence for the involvement of a matrix metalloproteinase in TSHR cleavage at the cell surface (7Couet J. Sar S. Jolivet A. Vu Hai M.-T. Milgrom E. Misrahi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4545-4552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 14Couet J. de Bernard S. Loosfelt H. Saunier B. Milgrom E. Misrahi M. Biochem. 1996; 35: 14800-14805Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Matrix metalloproteinases have broad amino acid sequence specificities (for example, Refs.15Black R.A. Durie F.H. Otten-Evans C. Miller R. Slack J.L. Lynch D.H. Castner B. Mohler K.M. Gerhart M. Johnson R.S. Itoh Y. Okada Y. Nagase H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The concept that the specificity of TSHR cleavage relates to the binding of a protease to this receptor rather than to a protease with a specific catalytic site is supported by the observation that transposition of an N-linked glycosylation site from the noncleaving LH/CG receptor to the corresponding region of the TSHR abrogates cleavage at Site 2 (9Kakinuma A.

Thus, a glycan moiety could provide steric hindrance to the binding of a protease. Similarly, it is possible that the 50-amino acid insertion could contain a protease binding site because deletion of this tract eliminates cleavage at Site 1 (8Tanaka K. Chazenbalk G.D. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1959-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is intriguing, however, that each of these two modifications to the TSHR appears to eliminate cleavage at only one of the two sites. These data suggest that either two distinct proteases are responsible for TSHR cleavage, or alternatively, cleavage involves two separate binding sites for the same protease. Another possible role for the 50-amino acid insertion in TSHR cleavage is that this segment has intrinsic protease activity and clips the receptor at an adjacent site. The present data do not support this hypothesis. Thus, every quartile of the 50-amino acid insertion can be deleted without abrogating TSHR cleavage. Deletion of a catalytic element is unlikely to leave TSHR cleavage at Site 1 unaffected or only partially affected. We suggest a model (Fig. 5) that integrates the present data with the following previously known features of the TSHR ectodomain. (i) The insertion (residues 317–366) is a very hydrophilic structure that can be deleted without affecting the conformational integrity of the TSHR (6Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Russo D. Rapoport B. Science. 1990; 249: 1423-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) or loss of of the ligand binding A subunit (6Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Russo D.

Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2135-2138PubMed Google Scholar), which is linked by disulfide bridges to the membrane-spanning B subunit; (ii) although the precise residues at cleavage Sites 1 and 2 are unknown, these sites appear to lie close to each end of the 50-amino acid insertion (8Tanaka K.

Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2135-2138PubMed Google Scholar); and (iii) for the A and B subunits to remain linked after cleavage, the cysteine residues involved in linkage must lie outside the two cleavage sites. Indeed, the cysteines most likely to link the A and B subunits are closely upstream of cleavage Site 1 (Cys-283, Cys-284, Cys-301 on the A subunit) and downstream of cleavage Site 2 (Cys-390, Cys-398, Cys-408 on the B subunit) (reviewed in Ref. 1Rapoport B. Chazenbalk G.D. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 673-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that the 50-amino acid insertion is an external loop on the surface of the TSHR, with its first and fourth quartiles being drawn together by disulfide bonding. Consequent to intramolecular cleaving, all or most of this insertion is removed like a polyp clipped at its base. The present observations raise the possibility that the first and fourth quartiles (the base of the polyp) constitute a binding site for a protease that clips the receptor at Site 1. Further cleavage at Site 2, whether by the same or a different protease, releases the polyp from the receptor in the form of a C peptide, which either remains intact or is degraded.

The sequence of Cak1p differs from other members of the protein kinase superfamily in several conserved regions. Cak1p lacks the highly conserved glycine loop motif (GXGXXG) that is found in the nucleotide binding fold of virtually all protein kinases and also lacks a number of conserved amino acids found at sites throughout the protein kinase core sequence. We have used kinetic and mutagenic analyses to investigate whether these sequence differences affect the nucleotide-binding properties of Cak1p. Although Cak1p differs dramatically from other protein kinases, it binds ATP with a reasonable affinity, with a K M of 4.8 μm. Mutations of the putative invariant lysine in Cak1p (Lys-31), homologous to a residue required for activity in virtually all protein kinases and that interacts with the ATP phosphates, moderately reduced the ability of Cak1p to bind ATP but did not dramatically affect the catalytic rate of the kinase. Similarly, Cak1p is insensitive to the ATP analog 5′-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine, which inhibits most protein kinases through covalent modification of the invariant lysine. We found that Cak1p is tolerant of mutations within its glycine loop region. Remarkably, Cak1p remains functional even following truncation of its first 31 amino acids, including the glycine loop region and the invariant lysine. We conclude that the Cak1p nucleotide-binding pocket differs significantly from those of most other protein kinases and therefore might provide a specific target for an inhibitory drug.

Members of the protein kinase superfamily are related by several highly conserved amino acid motifs that make up the catalytic core (1Taylor S.S. Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Sowadski J.M.

The degree of sequence identity found among residues within this core is remarkable, and several of the motifs are considered to be essentially invariant. The three-dimensional structures of these core regions are predicted to be fundamentally the same (3Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and for the protein kinases that have been crystallized to date, this turns out to be the case (4Knighton D.R.

Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). One extremely well conserved protein kinase motif is the glycine loop. This motif, which contains the consensus sequence GXGXXG (where X is any amino acid), is located in subdomain I near the amino terminus of the kinase domain (12Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3812) Google Scholar, 13Bossemeyer D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 201-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 14Hemmer W. McGlone M. Tsigelny I. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16946-16954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The glycine residues provide flexibility and allow the loop to fold over the nucleotide, thereby excluding solvent from the active site and anchoring the ATP molecule. This interaction with the nucleotide occurs via the backbone amides of the loop and the β- and γ-phosphates of the ATP (13Bossemeyer D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 201-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 14Hemmer W. McGlone M. Tsigelny I. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16946-16954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The importance of this motif has been demonstrated by mutagenic analysis of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA).1 Mutation of either of the first two glycine residues in the loop increased theK M for ATP by 10-fold and reduced the catalytic rate of the enzyme by severalfold, whereas mutation of the third glycine had only minor effects (14Hemmer W. McGlone M. Tsigelny I. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16946-16954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Similarly, substitution of the second glycine of this motif in phosphorylase kinase reduced theV max for the enzyme by more than 30-fold, although the first glycine residue was less sensitive to substitution (15Lee J.-H. Maeda S. Angelos K.L. Kamita S.G. Ramachandran C. Walsh D.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10616-10625Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The importance of this motif is further underscored by the fact that a mutation of the third glycine residue in the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor impairs protein kinase activity and has been implicated in one form of human diabetes (16Odawara M. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto R. Shibasaki Y. Tobe K. Accili D. Bevins C. Mikami Y. Matsuura N. Akanuma Y. Takaku F. Taylor S.I. Kasuga M. Science. 1989; 245: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A second highly conserved feature of protein kinases is the so-called invariant lysine residue, which is located 14–23 amino acid residues carboxyl-terminal to the glycine loop within the ATP-binding pocket. This residue interacts with the α- and β-phosphates of ATP and is critical for the proper alignment of the triphosphate chain in the active site. This lysine has been shown to be required for protein kinase activity in both serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases (2Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar) and is a standard site of mutation in the construction of catalytically inactive kinases. For example, mutation of this residue in PKA reduced the catalytic rate of the enzyme by 99.9%, whereas theK M for ATP was only moderately affected (17Gibbs C.S. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8923-8931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the invariant lysine generally seems to function primarily in catalysis, rather than in nucleotide binding (17Gibbs C.S.

Due to the exceptional degree of sequence conservation among members of the protein kinase superfamily, enzymes that lack one or more conserved motifs are relatively unusual. One such protein kinase is Cak1p, theCdk Activating Kinase fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae. This essential protein is responsible for activating the major cyclin-dependent kinase in budding yeast, Cdc28p, by phosphorylating a conserved threonine residue (Thr-169) in the activation loop (20Espinoza F.H. Farrell A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Morgan D.O. Science. 1996; 273: 1714-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 21Kaldis P. Sutton A. Solomon M.J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and the activity of Cak1p is likewise essential in vivo (21Kaldis P. Sutton A. Solomon M.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 22Thuret J.-Y. Valay J.-G. Faye G. Mann C. Cell. 1996; 86: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Cak1p, however, is only distantly related to the identified CAK in higher eukaryotes, which is a multi-subunit complex consisting of a kinase subunit, p40MO15; a regulatory partner, cyclin H; and an assembly factor, MAT1 (26Solomon M.J. Kaldis P. Pagano M. Results and Problems in Cell Differentiation: Cell Cycle Control. 22. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998: 79-109Google Scholar). In contrast Cak1p functions as a monomer 2Kaldis, P., Pitluk, Z. W., Bany, I. A., Enke, D. A., Wagner, M., Winter, E., and Solomon, M. J. (1998) J. Cell Sci. 111, 3585–3596 (21Kaldis P. Sutton A. Solomon M.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and is only 20–25% identical to p40MO15, its closest relative in vertebrates. Several lines of evidence indicate that Cak1p contains an unusual nucleotide binding region. Sequence alignment of Cak1p with other protein kinases shows that it does not contain a glycine loop motif near its amino terminus. We are aware of only two other protein kinases, Vps15p and Mik1, that lack a glycine motif in this region (27Herman P.K. Stack J.H. DeModena J.A. Emr S.D. Cell. 1991; 64: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar,28Lundgren K. Walworth N. Booher R. Dembski M. Kirschner M. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 64: 1111-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In addition, mutational analysis of Cak1p has shown that the “invariant lysine” residue (Lys-31) is not required for Cak1p function in vivo (Refs. 22Thuret J.-Y. Valay J.-G. Faye G. Mann C. Cell. 1996; 86: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 29Chun K.T. Goebl M.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, and this study). In this paper, we characterize the nature of the nucleotide-binding pocket of Cak1p by kinetic and mutagenic analyses. We have determined the basic kinetic parameters for wild type Cak1p and for Cak1p containing substitutions at the invariant lysine residue and in the glycine loop region. We describe experiments that probe the role of the invariant lysine residue of Cak1p using the nucleotide analog FSBA. The conclusions drawn from these experiments indicate that the ATP-binding site of Cak1p is functionally diverged from other members of the protein kinase superfamily, especially with respect to the role of the invariant lysine residue. Unlike other protein kinases, Cak1p is relatively insensitive to substitutions in the glycine loop region.

The purified human CDK2 used in this study was provided by Alicia Russo and Nikola Pavletich and was purified as described (32Russo A.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled CDK2 was separated from free [γ-32P]ATP on 10% polyacrylamide gels and quantified using a Bio-Rad GS-250 PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). Imager units were converted to counts/min by excising bands from a phosphorimaged gel and scintillation counting. Based on this data, a conversion factor was calculated to convert PhosphorImager units to counts/min. The PhosphorImager units were shown to be linear with increasing signal and exposure times. In all assays, unless otherwise noted, less than 10% of total substrate was phosphorylated. To determine theK M(ATP) for baculovirus-produced Cak1p, 5 μl of enzyme substrate mix containing 4 nm Cak1p and 6 μm human CDK2 was mixed with 5 μl of ATP or GTP mix ranging in concentration from 1.25 μm to 1.28 mm with a specific activity of 10 μCi/pmol of nucleotide. To determine the K M(CDK2), 5 μl of a Cak1p/ATP mix containing 4 nm Cak1p, 200 μmATP, 1 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP was added to 5 μl of CDK2 mix ranging in concentration from 0.06 to 15 μm. Samples were prepared in CAK buffer and contained 150 mm NaCl. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Phosphorylated CDK2 was separated from free counts by SDS-PAGE. Following PhosphorImager analysis, K M determinations were made by fitting the data sets to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the Kaleidagraph program (Version 2.1.3, Abelbeck Software, Stable Isotope Lab, University of Michigan). K M determinations using E. coli produced GST-Cak1p proteins (wild type and mutants) were performed as above with 360 nm GST-Cak1p in the enzyme substrate mix. ForK M(ATP) determinations the concentrations of CDK2 were at least 5-fold in excess of theK M(CDK2) for each GST-Cak1p protein unless otherwise indicated. K M(CDK2)determinations for the K31A and ΔGly mutants contained 1 mm ATP. To determine the ability of FSBA and ADP to inhibit Cak1p, 5 μl of 4 nmCak1p and 3 μm CDK2 was added to 5 μl of 200 μm ATP, 0.5 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm DTT, and FSBA or ADP ranging in concentration from 7.8 μm to 2 mm in FSBA buffer. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Phosphorylated CDK2 was quantified as described above. To measure the ability of ADP and AMPPNP to inhibit Cak1p competitively in buffer lacking Me2SO, 5 μl of a mixture containing Cak1p and CDK2 as described above was incubated with 5 μl containing 200 μm ATP, 0.5 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP, and ATP, ADP, or AMPPNP ranging in concentration from 7.8 μm to 2 mm in CAK buffer. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. To determine the sensitivity of Cak1p to FSBA, 2 nm Cak1p was incubated with 1 mm FSBA at room temperature in FSBA buffer. At each time point, 5 μl was added to 5 μl of CAK buffer containing 20 mm DTT to inactivate the FSBA, and the sample was then stored on ice. 5 μl of a mixture containing 300 μm ATP, 1.0 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP, 220 ng of CDK2, 20 mm DTT in CAK buffer was added. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and terminated with the addition of 15 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Control samples contained FSBA buffer with 10% Me2SO. To measure the sensitivity of human CDK2-cyclin A to FSBA, a sample containing 455 nm CDK2-cyclin A was incubated with 1 mm FSBA as described above. At each time point, 5 μl of the mixture was added to CAK buffer containing 20 mm DTT to inactivate the FSBA. 5 μl of the stopped reaction was added to 5 μl of 1 mm ATP, 0.25 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP, and 267 μg/ml histone H1. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Phosphorylated CDK2 was quantified as described above. To measure the rate of ATP hydrolysis by baculovirus-produced GST-Cak1p, 3P. Kaldis and M. J. Solomon, unpublished results. 3.8 μm GST-Cak1p in 7.5 μl of CAK buffer was added to 7.5 μl of ATP mix containing 200 μm ATP, 2.5 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP in CAK buffer. At each time point, 1 μl of the assay was added to 4 μl of Stop buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mmDTT, 1 mg/ml ovalbumin, 0.1% Tween, and 1× protease inhibitors. 1 μl of the terminated reaction was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine cellulose plate (Selecto Scientific, Norcross, GA), and ascending chromatography was performed for 2 h in 50 mm HCl. Plates were dried and chromatographed a second time under the same buffer conditions. Plates were then dried under a lamp and subjected to PhosphorImager analysis. Data are expressed as a percent of the total ATP hydrolyzed after subtracting background orthophosphate present in the [γ-32P]ATP mix. To determine the effect of FSBA on ATPase activity, 5 μl of mix containing 2.9 μm baculovirus GST-Cak1p, 100 μm FSBA, 10 mm DTT in FSBA buffer or 4 μl of mix lacking DTT was preincubated for 30 min at room temperature. 1 μl of 50 mm DTT was then added to the reaction lacking DTT. 5 μl of ATP mix containing 100 μm ATP, 5 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP in FSBA buffer was added, and the reactions were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Chromatography and quantitation were performed as above. To determine the thermal stability of wild type and mutant GST-Cak1p, 700 nm GST-Cak1p in CAK buffer was incubated at a given temperature for 10 min and then stored on ice until assay. 5 μl of 1.5 μm CDK2, 200 μm ATP, 0.5 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP in CAK buffer was added, and the samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. CDK2 phosphorylation was analyzed as described above. Because of the extensive differences between Cak1p and other protein kinases, particularly within the ATP-binding site, we decided to characterize the ability of Cak1p to utilize nucleotides (ATP and GTP) and protein substrate. As a substrate, we used the human cyclin-dependent kinase, CDK2, rather than the endogenous yeast CDK, Cdc28p. CDK2 can function in yeast in place of Cdc28p (23Deshaies R.J. Kirschner M. Proc. Natl.

Finally, unlike Cdc28p, CDK2 is soluble at the high concentrations necessary for the analyses reported here. To determine the K M values for the nucleotides, we performed kinase assays over a wide range of ATP or GTP concentrations at a fixed concentration of the CDK2 substrate equal to five times theK M(CDK2) (∼3.5 μm). The extent of CDK2 phosphorylation was quantified with a PhosphorImager, and the data were fit directly to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Fig.1). TheK M(ATP) for wild type Cak1p was 4.8 μm. The K M(GTP) for Cak1p was over 200-fold higher than theK M(ATP), whereas the extrapolatedV max value was slightly lower (Fig.1 A). Similarly, we determined theK M(CDK2) by performing assays at a saturating ATP concentration while varying the concentration of CDK2 over a broad range (Fig. 1 B). TheK M(CDK2) was determined to be 0.7 μm. The V max value was 56.8 pmol of phosphate transferred per min per μg of Cak1p, which corresponds to a kcat value of 2.6 per min.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar). The role of this lysine in Cak1p may differ from that of other protein kinases, since Cak1p containing substitutions at this site have been reported to be functional in vivo and to have partial activity in vitro (22Thuret J.-Y. Valay J.-G. Faye G. Mann C. Cell. 1996; 86: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 29Chun K.T. Goebl M.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In order to examine the role of this residue in the active site of Cak1p, we tested the sensitivity of Cak1p to the nucleotide analog 5′-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA). FSBA covalently modifies the invariant lysine of protein kinases, thereby inhibiting their activity (12Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3812) Google Scholar, 35Hathaway G.M. Zoller M.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol.

We treated Cak1p or CDK2-cyclin A complexes with FSBA for up to 2 h. At various time points, samples were removed and added to buffer containing DTT to inactivate the remaining FSBA. Cak1p was then assayed for its ability to phosphorylate CDK2; CDK2 was assayed using histone H1 as a substrate (Fig.2 A). FSBA completely inactivated the CDK2 within 20 min, whereas Cak1p was virtually insensitive to FSBA over the entire 2-h time course. We also found that the presence of saturating amounts of CDK2 did not make Cak1p sensitive to FSBA (data not shown). Thus Lys-31 in Cak1p is positioned differently from the equivalent lysine in other protein kinases, resulting in either a reduced binding or reactivity to FSBA. We presume that Lys-31 also has an altered interaction with ATP. It was possible that the insensitivity of Cak1p to FSBA was simply due to the inability of the enzyme to bind the nucleotide analog. To test this possibility, we performed competition assays using either DTT-inactivated FSBA, ADP, or ATP (Fig. 2 B). Both ADP and FSBA competed with ATP. FSBA competed at least as well as ATP, indicating that its inability to inactivate Cak1p is not due to lack of binding to the ATP-binding pocket of Cak1p. To examine further the nature of the ATP-binding pocket of Cak1p, we compared the ability of Cak1p and CDK2-cyclin A complexes to bind adenine derivatives. Competition assays were performed in which ADP and AMPPNP concentrations were varied while the concentration of ATP was held constant (Fig. 2, C and D). The abilities of both ADP and AMPPNP to compete for ATP binding were similar for the two enzymes. ADP competed more effectively than AMPPNP, which inhibited only 60% of the activity of either enzyme when present in 5-fold excess over ATP. By contrast, ADP competed with [γ-32P]ATP for binding to each enzyme nearly as well as unlabeled ATP itself. A 5-fold excess of ADP inhibited CDK2 by 80% and Cak1p by 60%. Therefore, although the two enzymes had similar overall binding specificities for ATP, ADP, and AMPPNP, Cak1p had slightly greater discrimination against ADP. The results of the above experiments indicated that the orientation and/or reactivity of the invariant lysine within the ATP-binding pocket of Cak1p was unusual. To examine the role of this residue in more detail, mutant Cak1p proteins containing conservative (K31R) and non-conservative (K31A) mutations of Lys-31 were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusions in E. coli. We purified the mutant proteins and determined their kinetic parameters after assaying them over a wide range of ATP and CDK2 concentrations. The results of these experiments for wild type and mutant GST-Cak1p proteins are shown in Fig. 3 Aand Table I. TheK M(ATP) for wild type K31R and K31A GST-Cak1p were 5.2, 44.9, and 248.0 μm, respectively, indicating that mutations of the invariant lysine have a direct effect on nucleotide bindin"

Active Na+/K+-transport through mammalian cell membranes catalyzed by the sodium pump needs the interaction of high and low affinity ATP binding sites during catalysis (1Thoenges D. Schoner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16315-16321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). During pumping, a high affinity ATP site (E1ATP site)1 is phosphorylated when Na+/K+-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.37) is in its Na+-exporting E1 conformational state. Dephosphorylation, however, turns the enzyme to the K+-importing E2 conformation that binds ATP with low affinity (E2ATP site) (for a review, see Ref. 2Glynn I.M. Martonosi A.N. 2nd Ed. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 3. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 35-144Google Scholar). The kinetics of substrate hydrolysis of the enzyme vary with the nature of the nucleoside triphosphate. Although ATP hydrolysis proceeds in a negative cooperative way (3Neufeld A.H. Levy M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 223: 6493-6497Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by 2′,3′-O(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-ATP (TNP-ATP), a substance that is not hydrolyzed, was reported to be partially competitive and noncompetitive (4Moczydlowski E.G.

Moreover, 2′(3′)-O(6-N′,N′-dimethylaminonaphthalenesulfonyl)-ATP (DANS-ATP) and 8-N3-DANS-ATP, which are not hydrolyzed either, show a positive cooperative effect during interaction with Na+/K+-ATPase (1Thoenges D. Schoner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16315-16321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). MgATP complex analogs can discriminate between E1ATP and E2ATP binding sites (5Schoner W. Thönges D. Hamer E. Antolovic R. Buxbaum E. Willeke M. Serpersu E.H. Scheiner-Bobis G. Bamberg E. Schoner W.

Although Cr(H20)4ATP (Cr-ATP) inactivates the E1ATP binding site, Co(NH3)4ATP (Co-ATP) inactivates the E2ATP site (6Pauls H. Bredenbröcker B. Schoner W. Eur. J.

The ribosyl-modified TNP-ATP is known as a substance that binds in relation to ATP with increased affinities to both ATP binding sites (4Moczydlowski E.G. Fortes P.A.G. J. Biol.

Furthermore, we showed recently that ribosyl-modified DANS-ATP binds with much higher affinity to the E2ATP site than to the E1ATP site (1Thoenges D. Schoner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16315-16321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This peculiar phenomenon is not understood very well. A better understanding would be helpful not only to find more protein-reactive ATP derivatives with a preference for the low affinity E2ATP binding site but also to realize whether the method of analysis of the complex kinetics with a Koshland-Némethy-Filmer model of two cooperating ATP sites is generally applicable to all ATP derivatives. Hence, such a model would describe a general property of the enzyme. This would also include that it is justified to extrapolate from the knowledge of microscopic dissociation constants of the E1ATP and E2ATP sites, obtained from the inactivation with MgATP complex analogs (5Schoner W.

Therefore, we started a careful kinetic analysis of a number of ATP and nucleoside analogs with modified ribose and polyphosphate moieties.

The correlation of kinetic data with structural data led to a postulate of minimal requirements of ATP analogs for high affinity interaction with the low affinity E2ATP site. Such properties are a “thickened” adenine ring because of stacking of a ribose-ligated bulky fluorophore at an flexible ribose moiety. 1-Pyrenesulfonyl chloride, 1-anthracenesulfonyl chloride, and N-methylisatoic anhydride were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). DANS-tryptophan (DANS-TRP) was supplied by Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). Lab-Trol, a protein standard used in clinical chemical analysis, was delivered by Baxter Dade (Dudingen, Switzerland). Na+/K+-ATPase from pig kidneys with a specific activity of 18–25 units/mg was purified by a modification of Jørgensen′s procedure (10Jφrgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using Lab-Trol as a standard. When the inhibitory effect of ATP analogs on Na+/K+-activated ATP hydrolysis was studied, variable concentrations of all nucleotides were included into the optical assay. For measurement of the hydrolysis of 3′(2′)-O-methylanthraniloyl-ATP (MANT-ATP) and 3′(2′)-O(5-fluor-2,4-dinitrophenyl)-ATP (FDNP-ATP), no ATP was added to the optical assay. The reaction was generally started with 0.1 units of Na+/K+-ATPase. The structures of ATP derivatives used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. 1-N 6-Ethenoadenosine 5′-triphosphate (ε-ATP) was obtained by a method of Barrio et al. (12Barrio J.R. Secrist III, J.A.

The purity of the compounds was controlled by thin-layer chromatography (Silica gel 60 F254, 10:6:3n-butyl alcohol/water/acetic acid) and by UV, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy. To determine the concentration of ATP analogs, the amount of ribose and phosphate was analyzed by the orcin test and the method of Fiske and Subarrow, respectively. Microscopic dissociation constants of the complexes of E1ATP and E2ATP binding sites with the ATP analogs of interest were estimated from the protective effect of the substances against the inactivation of Na+/K+-ATPase by Cr-ATP and Co-ATP (1Thoenges D.

Cr-ATP has been shown to inactivate by tight binding and by phosphorylation the E1ATP site of Na+/K+-ATPase (6Pauls H. Bredenbröcker B. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and Co-ATP by forming a tight complex with the E2ATP site (8Scheiner-Bobis G. Fahlbusch K. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 1 unit of Na+/K+-ATPase was incubated in a total volume of 250 μl at 37 °C in 60 mm imidazole, HCl, pH 7.25, and increasing concentrations of Cr-ATP (10–100 μm) or Co-ATP (100–1000 μm). The inactivation of Na+/K+-ATPase was recorded in the absence and presence of the respective ATP analog by transferring an aliquot of 20 μl of the reaction medium in intervals of 15 min to the optical assay. Rate constants of inactivation and dissociation constants of the enzyme·nucleotide complexes were determined by the method of Piszkiewics and Smith (18Piszkiewics D. Smith E.L. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4544-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and the two-site model (see Equation 2). Na+/K+-ATPase was inactivated by FITC at pH 9 (9Scheiner-Bobis G. Antonipillai J. Farley R.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9592-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and washed in 50 mmTris, HCl, pH 7.5. An amount of this enzyme equivalent to 0.1 units of untreated Na+/K+-ATPase or 0.1 units of native enzyme was assayed for K+-activated phosphatase. Increasing concentrations of p-nitrophenyl phosphate were incubated with 5 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl in the presence or absence of variable amounts of ATP analogs on microtiter plates at room temperature. The reaction was stopped after 15 min of hydrolysis with 1 n NaOH. Absorbance was measured at 410 nm. A two-site model according to Koshland, Némethy, and Filmer (Fig. 2) was used to analyze the kinetics of ATP analogs (1Thoenges D. Schoner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16315-16321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Koshland Jr., D.E. Nemethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar). The equations for the rate of hydrolysis of substrate S in presence of an inhibitor I (see Equation 1) or the rate of inactivation by an inhibitor I in presence of a protecting ligand S (see Equation 2) were derived according to Segel (20Segel E.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). The latter equation takes into account the specificity of Cr-ATP to the E1ATP binding site (y = 1, c against infinity) and the specificity of Co-ATP to the E2ATP binding site (y against infinity). All computations and calculations of binding parameters were performed by use of the program Prism 2.0 of GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA 92121. The overall reaction in presence of an inhibitor is expressed as υpVp,max=[S]z×Kd+[S]2a×Kd21+2×[S]Kd+[S]2a×Kd2+2×[S]×[I]b×Kd×KI+2×[I]KI+[I]2c×KI2Equation 1 and inactivation by Cr-ATP or Co-ATP in the presence of a ligand is expressed as υiVi,max=[I]y×KI+[S]b×Kd×KI+[I]2c×KI21+2×[I]KI+[I]2c×K12+2×[S]Kd+2×[S]×[I]b×Kd×KI+[S]2a×Kd2Equation 2 After exchange of the removable protons, the 1H NMR spectra were recorded in D2O in a Bruker AM 400 MHz spectrograph. The coupling constants of the protons of ribose allowed an evaluation of the time-averaged structure (21Sänger W. Principles of Nucleic Acid Structures.

ATP analogs are termed as flexible if 3 Hz < (J1,2 and J3,4) < 7 Hz and are termed as fixed if 3 Hz > (J1,2 or J3,4) > 7 Hz. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements were performed by the time-correlated single photon-counting method using synchrotron radiation as a source of the excitation light (23Obsil T. Merola F. Lewit-Bentley A. Amler E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The instrumental function and fluorescence decays were measured sequentially during several 10 of cycles and stored in groups of 2048 channels each (time interval 44.2 ps/channel; total number of counts exceeded 106 for each measurement; temperature adjusted to 25 °C by water bath; excitation wavelength λ = 290 nm; emission wavelength λ = 415 nm; excitation and emission bandwidth 9 nm). The total fluorescence decays were collected with the excitation polarizer set to the vertical position and the emission polarizer set at 54.7° (magic angle). A total of 2–3 million counts were collected in each decay, and the maximum entropy method was used for data analysis. The final lifetime distribution was split into as many species as there are peaks separated by two well defined maxima. The first order averaged lifetime τ was then calculated as Σ ciτi. Errors on averaged lifetimes are based on estimates of the repeatability of the measurements. Molecular properties of ATP analogs were determined using the semi-empirical method AM1 (24Dewar M.J.S. Zoebisch E.G. Healy E.F. Stewart J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3902-3909Crossref Scopus (15064) Google Scholar) implemented in the program MOPAC 7. The geometric optimization is characterized by a minimization of the force constants. To learn whether the knowledge of the microscopic dissociation constant of the enzyme complex with an ATP derivative at a specific ATP site may facilitate the kinetic analysis of the overall reaction according to the Koshland-Némethy-Filmer model, the interaction of TNP-ATP with Na+/K+-ATPase was evaluated. Affinities of TNP-ATP for the two substrate binding sites (Fig. 2) were determined from their protective effect against the inactivation by Cr-ATP and Co-ATP (Fig. 3). TheK d = 0.7 ± 0.3 μm anda = 300 ± 100 of TNP-ATP obtained by the fitting process (Equation 2) to the data analyzed with both inactivating MgATP analogs is in good agreement with direct measurements in the native enzyme (4Moczydlowski E.G. Fortes P.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2357-2366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the analysis of inhibition of TNP-ATP on the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate withK I = 160 ± 20 μm in a FITC-treated enzyme but with K I = 7 ± 2 μm in native enzyme is indicative for negative cooperativity (Fig. 4). ATP hydrolysis by Na+/K+-ATPase also shows negative cooperativity (3Neufeld A.H. Levy M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 223: 6493-6497Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The complex kinetics of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of TNP-ATP could not be described quantitatively so far (4Moczydlowski E.G. Fortes P.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2357-2366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the two-site model (Fig. 2, Equation 1) was applied to fit curves to experimental points, an excellent fit was obtained (Fig.5). Using the KI values of TNP-ATP as determined above for both ATP sites as microscopic dissociation constants, the experimental finding of downward-bending lines in the double reciprocal plot was quantitatively described by the parameters K d(ATP) = 0.3 ± 0.1 μm, K I(TNP-ATP) = 0.1 ± 0.05 μm, a = 400 ± 100,b = 70 ± 30, c = 2000 ± 500, and z = 8 ± 4 (Fig. 5). Hence, the knowledge of microscopic dissociation constants for the two ATP binding sites facilitates the fitting of kinetic data of the overall reaction, considerably. Because this procedure was already applied successfully in a previous study to describe the interaction of another ATP derivative with Na+/K+-ATPase (1Thoenges D. Schoner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16315-16321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), this procedure seems to be valid generally. Therefore, it was applied in the subsequent study as well.Figure 4Analysis of K+-activated hydrolysis of p-nitrophenylphosphatase in the presence of TNP-ATP. The effect of various concentrations of TNP-ATP on the activity of K+-activatedp-nitrophenylphosphatase was measured in native (top) and FITC-treated Na+/K+-ATPase (bottom). Treatment of Na+/K+-ATPase by FITC is known to block the Cr-ATP-sensitive E1ATP binding site but not the Co-ATP sensitive E2ATP binding site (7Linnertz H. Thönges D. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).

The solid lines are the result of an analysis according to the Koshland-Némethy-Filmer model (Equation1) using the parameters of Fig. 3 for the fitting process. The following parameters (S.D. of three different measurements) were obtained: K d(ATP) = 0.3 ± 0.1 μm, KI(TNP-ATP) = 0.1 ± 0.05 μm, a = 400 ± 100,b = 70 ± 30, c = 2000 ± 500, z = 8 ± 4.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16315-16321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 4Moczydlowski E.G. Fortes P.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2357-2366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) other ribose-modified ATP analogs like MANT-ATP and FDNP-ATP are substrates of Na+/K+-ATPase (14Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) (TableI). A careful analysis of the E1ATP and E2ATP sites, as described above, showed for FDNP-ATP identical affinities for both substrate binding sites (K d = 10 μm) and, hence, a Michaelis-Menten type of hydrolysis (data not shown). MANT-ATP, however, exhibited a positive cooperativity with aK d = 200 ± 50 μm for the E1ATP site and a K d = 80 ± 40 μm for the E2ATP site. This result could be corroborated by an analysis of the effect of MANT-ATP on K+-activated p-nitrophenylphosphatase in a E1ATP site-blocked enzyme. It gave for MANT-ATP theK I = 100 ± 20 μm in a FITC-treated enzyme and K I = 300 ± 50 μm in an untreated enzyme (data not shown). Apparently, modification of the E1ATP binding site by the adenine-imitating FITC (to which MANT-ATP binds with low affinity) enhances in a positive cooperative way binding of MANT-ATP at the E2ATP site. When the overall kinetics of substrate hydrolysis were analyzed with the Koshland-Némethy-Filmer model (Equation 1), the following parameters were obtained by the fitting process: for MANT-ATP, K d = 200 ± 50 μm, a = 0.4 ± 0.2,z = 0.3 ± 0.2; for FDNP-ATP,K d = 5 ± 2 μm, a= 1 ± 0.3, z = 1 ± 0.5; and for ATP,K d = 1 ± 0.2 μm,a = 100 ± 20, z = 15 ± 5 (Fig. 6). Hence, the individual ATP derivatives do not only differ in their individual affinities for the two ATP bindings sites (Table I) but also in the turnover rate (z value). The maximal velocity of Na+/K+-supported hydrolysis of ATP (V max = 30 units/ml) is about 15 times faster than that of FDNP-ATP and about 50 times faster than that of MANT-ATP.Table IKinetic parameters of ATP analogsATP analogFunctionE1ATPE2ATPμmμmATPSubstrate0.3 ± 0.1120.0 ± 30TNP-ATPInhibitor0.7 ± 0.3210 ± 70FDNP-ATPSubstrate10 ± 310 ± 3DANS-ATPInhibitor100 ± 100.3 ± 0.2ANTS-ATPInhibitor300 ± 1003 ± 1PYRS-ATPInhibitor400 ± 1004 ± 1MANT-ATPSubstrate200 ± 5080 ± 40GTPSubstrateNo effectNo effectDANS-GTPNo substrate, no inhibitorNo effect500 ± 200CTPSubstrateNo effectNo effectDANS-CTPNo substrate, no inhibitorNo effectNo effectAdenosineNo substrate, no inhibitorNo effectNo effectDANS-AdenosineInhibitorNo effect10 ± 3AMPNo substrate, no inhibitorNo effectNo effectDANS-AMPInhibitorNo effect1 ± 0.5c-AMPNo substrate, no inhibitorNo effectNo effectDANS-cAMPNo substrate, no inhibitorNo effectNo effectMANT-cAMPNo substrate, no inhibitorNo effectNo effectTRPNo substrate, no inhibitorNo effectNo effectDANS-TRPInhibitor50 ± 10No effectRibose-modified ATP analogs were analyzed for their respective microscopic affinities for the E1ATP and E2ATP sites from their protective effects against the inactivation of Na+/K+-ATPase by Cr-ATP or Co-ATP (see “Material and Methods”). “No effect” means no protection detectable against the inactivation. Open table in a new tab Ribose-modified ATP analogs were analyzed for their respective microscopic affinities for the E1ATP and E2ATP sites from their protective effects against the inactivation of Na+/K+-ATPase by Cr-ATP or Co-ATP (see “Material and Methods”). “No effect” means no protection detectable against the inactivation. The Hill coefficient is a measure of cooperativity. It is calculated as the first derivative of Equation 1 as log(v/(1 −v)) against log(S). For the Koshland-Némethy-Filmer model of two interacting substrate sites, this derivative is shown in Equation 3. When the above-evaluated data were used to calculate the change of cooperativity as a function of substrate concentration, Fig.7 resulted. It is well known from the work of Cornish-Bowden and Koshland (25Cornish-Bowden A. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 95: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) that the cooperativity changes with the substrate concentration. Evidently negative cooperativity of ATP was most pronounced at very low ATP concentrations, i.e.at ATP concentrations that are commonly used for the demonstration of Na+-dependent phosphorylation (26Post R.L. Sen A.K. Rosenthal A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1437-1445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Higher concentrations of ATP are known to affect the hydrolysis of the phospho intermediate (27Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol.

Schoner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16315-16321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and why 2′,3′-O-TNP-ATP preferably interacts with the E1ATP site (Table I). Moreover, it is unclear why TNP-ATP and DANS-ATP as ribosyl-modified ATP derivatives are not substrates, but inhibitors, and why other ribosyl-modified ATP derivatives like MANT-ATP and FDNP-ATP are hydrolyzed. A possible answer for the E2ATP site specificity is that a bulky fluorescent substituent at the ribose may achieve a better affinity for this site. In the case of oxidative phosphorylation, the particular behavior of DANS-ADP was explained by a hydrophobic (charge-transfer, stacking) complex between the adenine and dansyl moiety (29Schäfer G. Onur G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 97: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, a number of dansylated nucleotides were synthesized and studied on the overall reaction as well as for their protective effect against the inactivation of the E1ATP site by Cr-ATP and the E2ATP site by Co-ATP (Table I). Consistent with the above hypothesis, dansylated purine triphosphates like DANS-ATP and DANS-GTP showed a preference for the E2ATP site, but the pyrimidine derivative DANS-CTP did not. Because all dansylated derivatives of adenosine (DANS-ATP, DANS-AMP, and DANS-adenosine) except 2′-O-DANS-3′,5′-cyclic AMP (DANS-cAMP) showed a preferential binding to the E2ATP site, it was in fact possible that interaction of a bulky residue with the purine part is of importance for the E2ATP site specificity. To get additional information on the validity of this assumption, PYRS-ATP and ANTS-ATP were synthesized and investigated. In fact, ANTS-ATP and PYRS-ATP behaved like DANS-ATP (Table I). Because neither DANS-cAMP and MANT-cAMP nor dansylated tryptophan showed this specificity for the E2ATP site, it is evident that the interaction between the adenosine and the fluorophore per se is not responsible for the E2ATP site specificity but that, additionally, a characteristic pucker of the ribose moiety in"

Biol. 1989; 110: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), 200 pS (skeletal SR in 100 mm Cl−) and 130 pS (cardiac SR in 250 mm Cl−) (8Townsend C. Rosenberg R.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 147: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This latter channel is also voltage-sensitive. We have characterized a protein kinase A-activated Cl− channel in the cardiac SR with a conductance of 116 pS (500 mm Cl− in the cis, 50 mm Cl− in the trans solution) (5Kawano S. Nakamura F.

Channel opening is regulated by PKA-dependent phosphorylation and by Ca2+-calmodulin, but insensitive to voltage or the levels of cytosolic Ca2+. It has been suggested that Cl− channels may function to maintain charge neutrality across the SR membrane generated by Ca2+movement during excitation-contraction coupling, but their functional characteristics are not well elucidated. Recently, it has been suggested that certain types of anion channels in the plasma membrane conduct adenine nucleotides such as ATP (9Abraham E.H. Prat A.G. Gerweck L. Seneveratne T. Arceci R.J.

It is not known, however, whether the 116-pS Cl− channel in cardiac SR conducts ATP or not. In the present study, we examined the anion permeability and whether ATP might permeate through this Cl− channel or not. We found that this channel could conduct adenine nucleotides, ATP, ADP, and AMP. A preliminary report of this work was presented in abstract form (16S. Kawano A. Kuruma A. Hiraoka M. Biophys.

S-adenosylmethionine human immunodeficiency virus systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment diethyl pyrocarbonate. Several genes involved in the biosynthesis of methionine inEscherichia coli are transcriptionally regulated by the methionine repressor, MetJ (1Saint-Girons I. Parsot C. Zakin M.M. Barzu O. Cohen G.N. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 23: S1-S42Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The basic interaction occurs between a homodimer of the 12-kDa MetJ repressor subunits and an 8-base pair sequence that constitutes a Met box (2Saint-Girons I. Duchange N. Cohen G.N. Zakin M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14282-14285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Met box is a tandem repeat that occurs between two and five times in natural operators and to which additional repressor dimers bind in a cooperative manner (3Phillips S.E.V. Manfield I. Parsons I.D. Davidson B.E. Rafferty J.B. Somers W.S. Margarita D. Cohen G.N. Saint-Girons I. Stockley P.G. Nature. 1989; 341: 711-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The protein has a βαα topology where the β-strands from each subunit intertwine to form an anti-parallel β-ribbon, which lies in the major groove of the target DNA. Binding specificity is largely determined by hydrogen bonds between the side chains of lysine 23 and threonine 25 of the β-strands and 4 purine bases in each Met box. Many hydrogen bonds are also made between the protein and the DNA phosphate backbone, and there is evidence that the conformation of the backbone is also important for binding (4Somers W.S. Phillips S.E.V. Nature. 1992; 359: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Binding of the MetJ repressor to DNA is modulated by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet),1 which markedly increases the affinity of MetJ for its target sequence. AdoMet and the DNA are bound on opposite faces of the protein, and binding of AdoMet does not significantly perturb the protein structure. The increased affinity of the holorepressor appears to be due to a long range electrostatic effect caused by the positively charged tertiary sulfur atom of AdoMet (5Phillips K. Phillips S.E.V. Structure. 1994; 2: 309-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 6Parsons I.D. Persson B. Mekhalfia A. Blackburn G.M. Stockley P.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Over the last decade in vitro selection and amplification techniques have been developed to isolate tight binding nucleic acid ligands for a wide range of target molecules (7Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8173) Google Scholar, 8Ellington A.D. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1990; 346: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (7739) Google Scholar). RNA molecules in particular have been isolated for a diverse set of targets, including proteins (9Schneider D. Tuerk C. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), amino acids (10Connell G.J. Illangeskare M. Yarus M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5497-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and nucleotides (11Sassanfer M. Szostak J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). These RNA aptamers potentially have very widespread applications as lead compounds in therapeutic situations, e.g. RNA-based inhibitors of the type I human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-I) reverse transcriptase (12Tuerk C. MacGougal S. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6988-6992Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 13Burke D.H. Scates L. Andrews K. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 650-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or as ligands in diagnostic kits and biosensors. Despite their importance we have relatively little structural information on the ways in which aptamers interact with protein targets. Recently, one of our laboratories reported the first x-ray crystal structure for an aptamer bound to the RNA bacteriophage MS2 coat protein (14Convery M.A. Roswell S. Stonehouse N.J. Ellington A.D. Hirao I. Murray J.B. Peabody D.S. Phillips S.E.V. Stockley P.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This structure revealed that the aptamer is bound to the natural RNA binding site of the protein, and although being based on differing primary and secondary structures, the aptamer is able to mimic most of the key recognition contacts of the natural ligand. To extend our knowledge of the way in which aptamers interact with their protein targets, we have isolated tight binding RNA ligands for the E. coli MetJ repressor, a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein with no known RNA-binding function.2 Previously, we have shown that systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) with degenerate DNA ligands results in isolation of tight binding DNA molecules based on the Met box consensus (16He Y.-Y. Stockley P.G. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), a situation analogous to the isolation of RNA aptamers for the MS2 coat protein (9Schneider D. Tuerk C. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, a high proportion of the SELEX-RNA ligands isolated by binding to MetJ contained the consensus sequence 5′-UGCAUACUCGUUN(3–16)A(G)GCAUUGCAGCA-3′, 2Y.-Y. He, A. L. Ellison, I. D. Parsons, P. G. Stockley, and L. Gold, manuscript in preparation. which is unrelated to the Met box DNA target. Remarkably, several of these ligands bind more tightly to an apo-MetJ dimer than does the DNA consensus, a two Met box site interacting with two cooperatively bound holorepressors (3Phillips S.E.V. Manfield I. Parsons I.D. Davidson B.E. Rafferty J.B. Somers W.S. Margarita D. Cohen G.N. Saint-Girons I. Stockley P.G. Nature. 1989; 341: 711-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of interest to determine how such RNA aptamers interact with MetJ. Do they mimic the binding of the natural DNA Met box (as for the MS2 coat protein with RNA ligands and MetJ with DNA ligands), or alternatively, do they represent novel solutions to the MetJ recognition problem? Inhibition of DNA binding proteins by RNA aptamers is likely to be of very general interest. DNA-binding proteins constitute a large group of potential drug targets, and RNA SELEX offers a route to generate tight binding inhibitors of such molecules. Here a number of techniques have been employed both to determine the solution structure of the highest affinity RNA ligand and to probe the nature of the interaction between the two macromolecules. In particular we have attempted to determine the regions of the RNA aptamer that are involved in binding to the protein. Similar approaches have been used to good effect to study the inhibition of HIV-I reverse transcriptase with RNA ligands (17Green L. Waugh S. Binkley J.P. Hostomska Z. Hostomsky Z. Tuerk C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the absence of high resolution structural data for the RNA-protein complex, these studies provide a useful insight into how the aptamer complex differs from the DNA operator complex with the same protein. RNA was synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 391 synthesizer usingt-butyldimethylsilyl RNA-phosphoramidites (ChemGenes, Stoke on Trent, UK). Ancillary RNA synthesis reagents were supplied by Applied Biosystems (Warrington, UK). The standard 1.0-μmol DNA synthesis cycle was used with a longer coupling and capping periods of 360 s and 40 s, respectively. Syntheses were carried out trityl-off. Protecting groups, other than the silyl group, were removed by treatment with 2 ml of fresh methanolic ammonia at 37 °C for 20 h. Desilylation was performed by dissolving the RNA in 500 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (Aldrich) and treating the solution with 500 μl of triethylamine trihydrofluoride (Aldrich) at room temperature for 48 h. The RNA was desalted on a NAP-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) prior to ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography using a NucleoPac PA-100 column (4 × 250 mm) (Dionex, Camberley, UK). The column was developed, at 55 °C, with an ammonium acetate gradient (0–1.5 m, pH 7.5) in solutions containing 10% (v/v) acetonitrile. The required fraction was dried in a rotary evaporator resuspended in sterile water and desalted as above. RNAs containing a hexaethylene glycol spacer were prepared as above using 18-O-dimethoxytritylhexaethylene glycol, 1-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)]phosphoramidite (Glen Research, Sterling, VA). Oligoribonucleotides containing 4-thiouridine were synthesized as above with one additional step. Immediately following synthesis the support-bound oligomers were treated with 1 ml of 0.3 m1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (Aldrich) in dry acetonitrile for 3 h at room temperature to remove the cyanoethyl group that protects the thiol (18Nikiforov T.T. Connolly B.A. Tetrahedron Lett. 1992; 33: 2379-2382Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene was then carefully decanted, and the support was extensively rinsed with acetonitrile, prior to treatment with methanolic ammonia. The 4-thiouridine phosphoramidite was synthesized as reported previously (19Adams C.J. Murray J.B. Arnold R.J.P. Stockley P.G. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 35: 765-768Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All oligoribonucleotides were stored at −20 °C. Base composition analysis was carried out as described previously (20Eadie J.S. McBride L.J. Efcavitch J.W. Hoff L.B. Cathcart R. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 165: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and the results were consistent with the predicted values for the oligoribonucleotide. Oligoribonucleotides were labeled, at their 5′-ends using [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (19Adams C.J. Murray J.B. Arnold R.J.P. Stockley P.G. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 35: 765-768Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the 3′-ends were labeled by the ligation of [5′-32P]pCp (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to the 3′-end using RNA ligase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 5.66-5.67Google Scholar). Labeled RNA was purified on 1.5-mm 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. RNA was eluted from the appropriate gel fragment by incubation in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS for 12 h at 37 °C. RNA was precipitated by the addition of 3 volumes of absolute ethanol. The pellet was collected by centrifugation, rinsed with absolute ethanol, and dried, before being resuspended in 50 μl of sterile water. MetJ repressor, purified as described (22He Y.-Y. McNally T.

D., Kinetic Studies of the E. coli Methionine Repressor-Operator Interaction. Ph.D thesis, 1996, University of Leeds, UK.Google Scholar), was a gift from Isobel D. Lawrenson (University of Leeds). It was supplied as an ammonium sulfate precipitate and stored at 4 °C until required. Precipitates were dissolved in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7) and dialyzed against this buffer, prior to use. The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (22He Y.-Y. McNally T. Manfield I. Navratil O. Old I.G. Phillips S.E.V. Saint-Girons I. Stockley P.G. Nature. 1992; 359: 431-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,23.Parsons, I. D., Kinetic Studies of the E. coli Methionine Repressor-Operator Interaction. Ph.D thesis, 1996, University of Leeds, UK.Google Scholar). RNA labeled at either the 5′- or the 3′-end (≈1 pg, ≈1 × 106 cpm) was digested with RNase T1 (Boehringer Mannheim), RNase A (Sigma), or RNase U2 (Sigma) in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, containing 6 units of tRNA (type X-SA, Sigma). Digestions were carried out at 37 °C for 15 min. The cleaved products were analyzed on a denaturing 19% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea and visualized by autoradiography or phosphorimaging (Fujifilm BAS 1500). Quantitation was carried out using the PhosphorImager associated software, TINA (Raytest Isotopenmeβgeräte GmbH). Diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) modification of adenosine and guanosine was performed essentially as described in Ref. 24Conway L. Wickens M. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar. Approximately 6 pg (≈5 × 106 cpm) of 5′- or 3′-labeled RNA in either 200 μl of native buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl) or 200 μl of denaturing buffer (50 mmsodium acetate, pH 4.5, 1 mm EDTA) were modified with 5 μl of DEPC at either 37 °C for 30 min (native buffer) or 90 °C for 2.5 min (denaturing buffer). The reaction was stopped with 75 μl of 1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and 750 μl of absolute ethanol. Following centrifugation the RNA pellet was dissolved in 200 μl of 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 3.8, and precipitated with 600 μl of absolute ethanol. The precipitated RNA was rinsed with absolute ethanol and dried. DEPC-modified RNA was then cleaved at the modified nucleotide by treatment with aniline (24Conway L. Wickens M. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The fragmented products were examined by denaturing gel electrophoresis, as above. RNA was chemically modified with either DEPC, hydrazine, or ethylnitrosourea. Adenosine and guanosine were modified with DEPC, as described above, using the denaturing buffer. Uridine bases were modified by dissolving an ethanol precipitate of labeled RNA (≈6 pg, ≈5 × 106 cpm) in 10 μl of hydrazine hydrate (24Conway L. Wickens M. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Following incubation on ice for 10 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 μl of 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 3.8, and 750 μl of absolute ethanol. The RNA pellet was re-precipitated, as described above, and dissolved in 15 μl of water. RNA phosphate ethylation was carried out with ethylnitrosourea (25Vlassov V.V. Giegé Ebel J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). About 6 pg of labeled RNA (≈5 × 106 cpm) in 0.3 msodium cacodylate, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, was treated with 4 μl of ethylnitrosourea (as a saturated ethanolic solution) at 80 °C for 2 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 μl of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0, and 100 μl of absolute ethanol. After centrifugation, the RNA pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 20 mmEDTA, and reprecipitated with 100 μl of absolute ethanol. The RNA pellet was rinsed with absolute ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 15 μl of water. The modified RNA (2–4 pg) was heated at 90 °C for 2 min, then placed at 37 °C for 15 min prior to its addition to 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 units of RNAguard (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), in the presence or absence of MetJ repressor (20 μm, dimer concentration) (final volume 20 μl). RNA binding does not require AdoMet (in contrast to the binding of Met box DNA) and so this was omitted from both the incubation buffer and the gel. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, after which 5 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 50% (w/v) glycerol was added. Gel retardation of the RNA was achieved by electrophoresis on a 1.5-mm-thick 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel, buffered with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The samples were briefly run into the gel at 300 V, and the gels then were run at 100 V using 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) running buffer. Following electrophoresis the appropriate bands were excised, and the RNA was recovered by elution as described above. 25 units of tRNA (type X-SA, Sigma) was added before the RNA was precipitated. Both DEPC- and hydrazine-modified RNAs were then cleaved at the modified nucleotides, using aniline, as described above. Ethylated RNA was cleaved with 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 9.0 (25Vlassov V.V. Giegé Ebel J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The cleaved products were visualized by denaturing gel electrophoresis as described above. Filter binding assays were performed as described previously (6Parsons I.D. Persson B. Mekhalfia A. Blackburn G.M. Stockley P.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The MetJ protein was serially diluted in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7, 50 mm KCl and incubated with approximately 20 nm RNA for 10 min at 37 °C. Samples were filtered through 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters (Whatman) and rinsed with 2 × 400 μl of binding buffer. Following drying, 5 ml of Ecoscint A (National Diagnostics) was added, and the samples were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. TheK d was estimated as the protein concentration at which half-maximal binding of the RNA occurred. Circular dichroism spectra were obtained using a Jobin Yvon CD6 Dichrograph with the cell (path length 10 mm) thermostatted at 37 °C, unless stated otherwise. Samples (0.15 ml) were prepared in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl. An RNA concentration of 1 μm was used, with the protein concentrations quoted in the legend of Fig. 9. Cross-linking of the MetJ repressor to RNA containing 4-thiouridine was carried out as described previously (26McGregor A. Rao M.V. Duckworth G. Stockley P.G. Connolly B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3173-3180Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Samples containing 7.5 μm MetJ repressor dimer and approximately 50 nm radiolabeled oligoribonucleotide in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7, 50 mm KCl, were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min prior to irradiation, at 350 nm, for 10 min. The oligoribonucleotide shown in Fig. 1 A was used, but with the uridines at positions 20, 23, 35, and 36 replaced with 4-thiouridine. Potential protein-RNA cross-links were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sequence and the predicted secondary structure of the SELEX RNA ligand used in this study is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of a stem-loop (terminal loop) and an internal loop (27Zuker M. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). To test this prediction experimentally, we have mapped the RNA ligand using ribonucleases and with DEPC. As shown in Fig.2, the terminal loop was most sensitive to cleavage by the single-strand specific nucleases RNase A ((C/U)-specific) and RNase U2 (A-specific). A number of nucleotides within and directly adjacent to the internal loop were also cleaved by the nucleases, but to a lesser degree than those in the terminal loop. These include A6/U7/A8 (5′-labeled strand) and C33/C38/C41 (3′-labeled strand). A few internal loop nucleotides, which would be expected to be cleaved, if single-stranded, were either not affected or were very poorly cut by the nucleases examined. Nucleotides in this category were C9/U10/C11 (5′-labeled strand) and A34/U35/U36/A39(3′-labeled strand). The nucleotide C29, which is predicted to be in a 2-nucleotide bulge in the main stem, was also susceptible to cleavage by RNase A. Consistent with most of the guanosines being double-stranded, RNase T1 (G-specific) did not cleave well, including position G37 within the internal loop. Comparison of DEPC modification (which modifies the N7 position of adenosine and, to a lesser extent, that of guanosine) of the RNA at 37 °C and 90 °C showed marked differences, with greater modification under denaturing as compared with native conditions, for two of the three adenosines (A31/A42), predicted to be in double-stranded regions (Fig. 2). The four adenosines (A6/A8/A34/A39) which are predicted to be in the internal loop, were also modified to a greater degree in the denatured oligonucleotide compared with the native one. In contrast, little difference in reactivity was observed for the two adenosines (A21/A22) in the terminal loop. The nucleotide A24 also behaved in this manner. Although predicted to be in a double-stranded region, this nucleotide is immediately adjacent to the terminal loop. The results are summarized in Fig. 3 and are in broad agreement with the predicted structure. The terminal loop, which closes the stem-loop, has properties consistent with its being single-stranded. The regions predicted to be double-stranded map as a duplex when probed with nucleases or DEPC. The most interesting region is the internal loop. A number of nucleotides within this region, that would be expected to be ribonuclease-sensitive, were either not cleaved or were cut significantly more slowly than those in the terminal loop. Similarly, several nucleotides have a diminished reactivity to DEPC in the native compared with the denatured RNA. This suggests that the internal loop cannot be considered as single-stranded but must contain some degree of stable secondary structure, limiting the accessibility of both ribonucleases and DEPC. It is conceivable that some of the bases on opposite sides of the internal loop form non-canonical base pairs. In addition bases on the same strand may be strongly stacked. Interactions between the bases in the RNA ligand and the MetJ repressor have been determined by binding-interference analysis. DEPC has been used to probe the role of adenosine and guanosine, and hydrazine has been utilized for uridine. The results for DEPC are shown in Fig. 4. To map the entire RNA sequence, it was necessary to use both 3′- and 5′-end labeling. A similar quality autoradiogram (not shown) was obtained using hydrazine. Scans of both the DEPC and hydrazine autoradiograms are shown in Fig. 5, and the results are summarized in Fig. 6. Both DEPC and hydrazine caused notable interference at a number of bases. Modification of bases within, and directly adjacent to, the internal loop significantly reduced the binding of the RNA ligand to MetJ. Modification of the eight bases in and around the terminal loop had no effect on binding. Modification of the bases in the intervening stem that connects the internal and the terminal loops had a mildly detrimental effect on binding. This strongly suggests that it is the internal loop region of the RNA ligand that is responsible for tight binding to the MetJ repressor.Figure 5Densitometry of the interference data found for MetJ using DEPC and hydrazine-modified RNA.

The deletions remove (a) the terminal loop and 2 base pairs from the stem and (b) the terminal loop, 5 base pairs from the stem, and the two single stranded cytosines (Fig. 1). In both cases the deleted bases were replaced by a hexaethylene glycol chain to substitute as a hairpin loop (28Durand M. Chevrie K. Chessignol M. Thuong N.T. Maurizot J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6353-6359Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The binding affinity of the two shortened RNA molecules to the MetJ repressor were determined using a filter binding assay (Fig. 7). Neither deletion markedly affected the binding of the RNA to MetJ.K d values (assessed as the protein-dimer concentration at which one-half of the counts were retained on the filter) of between 2 and 4 ± 0.5 × 10−7m were seen for both the deletions and the parent RNA ligand. A control RNA, consisting of the first 21 nucleotides of the parent RNA, did not bind to MetJ. These results clearly demonstrate that the initial, synthetic SELEX RNA fragment used does in fact bind tightly to MetJ as expected from the original SELEX experiment.2 Furthermore, we confirm that the internal loop of the RNA ligand encompasses the high affinity site for the MetJ repressor, in agreement with the binding-interference analysis. Although the terminal loop is not directly involved in binding it is necessary to allow the reversal of the RNA strand and hence the formation of the internal loop. Ethylnitrosourea, which ethylates the non-esterified oxygen atoms of backbone phosphates in nucleic acids, was used to probe the role of the RNA phosphate groups in binding to the MetJ repressor. No single phosphate was found to be critical for interaction with the MetJ repressor, i.e. there was no phosphate group, which when ethylated, strongly inhibited the binding of MetJ. This is shown in Fig. 8, which shows scans of the interference autoradiograms. The role of RNA phosphates in binding to MetJ has been further evaluated by the determination of K d values at various salt concentrations using a filter binding assay (data not shown). If interactions between negatively charged phosphates and positively charged amino acid side chains are important, theK d would be expected to increase with increasing ionic strength (29Lohman T.M. Mascotti D.P. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 400-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, with KCl concentrations of 10, 25, 50, and 100 mm, identicalK d values of 1.2 ± 0.3 × 10−7m were obtained. The dissociation constant was marginally higher at KCl concentrations of 150 and 200 mm, 2.3 ± 0.5 × 10−7 and 6.3 ± 1 × 10−7m, respectively. Interestingly, although the data at 100–200 mm salt fitted a typical protein-ligand binding isotherm, those at 10–50 mm KCl were notably steeper, suggesting that some form of cooperativity occurs. One possible explanation is that MetJ dimers may dissociate at low concentrations in low salt buffers. Although it has been shown that thermally denatured MetJ protein will readily reassociate (30Johnson C.M. Cooper A. Stockley P.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9717-9742Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we have no evidence for this dissociation. However, the related Arc repressor from bacteriophage P22 does dissociate into unfolded monomers with a dissociation constant of 5 × 10−9m (31Brown M.B. Bowie J.U. Sauer R.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11189-11195Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 32Burgering J.M.M. Hald M. Boelans R. Breg J.N. Kaptein R. Biopolymers. 1995; 35: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Alternatively, salt-dependent conformational changes of the RNA ligand could be involved, although the salt concentrations examined here had no effect upon the circular dichroism spectra of the RNA (not shown). Steep binding curves have been observed for the binding of MetJ protein to its DNA target (3Phillips S.E.V. Manfield I. Parsons I.D. Davidson B.E. Rafferty J.B. Somers W.S. Margarita D. Cohen G.N. Saint-Girons I. Stockley P.G. Nature. 1989; 341: 711-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because of these complexities caution is needed in the interpretation of how the K d varies with ionic strength. Nevertheless, the minor effect of salt concentration upon the affinity of the RNA ligand binding to MetJ agrees with the lack of phosphate ethylation interference. Both experiments suggest that interactions between the phosphates of the RNA ligand and the MetJ play a minor role in binding. Circular dichroism data (Fig.9) are consistent with the RNA being largely double-stranded and in an A-form conformation. The spectrum of the free RNA shows a large positive Δε at 263 nm and a small negative peak at 295 nm, typical of an A-form helix. Heating the RNA caused a decrease in the intensity of the main peak and a shift to 271 nm, consistent with the conversion of the RNA to a single strand (33Gray D.M. Su-Hwi H. Johnson K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the mapping data presented above, which show that the internal loop cannot be considered single-stranded, but must have some element of structure. Thus, with the exception of the single-stranded terminal loop, almost all of the RNA ligand appears to exist as an A-form duplex. However, the exact structure of the internal loop may deviate somewhat from classical A-duplex parameters. When the RNA ligand binds to the MetJ protein, there is hardly any change in the circular dichroism spectrum of the nucleic acid (Fig. 9), especially above 240 nm where almost all (≥90%) of the intensity is due to the nucleic acid. This suggests that there are no large conformational changes to the RNA after binding to the protein. It has previously been shown that both oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 4-thiothymidine and oligoribonucleotides containing 4-thiouridine can be used to photocross-link DNA- and RNA-binding proteins (26McGregor A. Rao M.V. Duckworth G. Stockley P.G. Connolly B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3173-3180Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 34Nikiforov T.T. Connolly B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We had hoped to use this approach to map the regions of MetJ in contact with the RNA ligand. Unfortunately, substitution of several uridines by 4-thiouridine, in the oligoribonucleotide shown in Fig. 1 A, and subsequent 350 nm irradiation of these oligoribonucleotides, in the presence of MetJ, failed to generate any cross-links (data not shown). Considering the data above, this is hardly surprising for the uridines (positions 20 and 23) in the terminal loop. The failure of 4-thiouridines, within the internal loop (positions 35 and 36), to cross-link was disappointing, particularly as modification of uridines 35 and 36, with hydrazine, interferes with MetJ binding (Figs. 5 and 6). However, we have previously shown that the proximity of 4-thiouridine to a protein is not necessarily sufficient for cross-linking to occur (26McGregor A. Rao M.V. Duckworth G. Stockley P.G. Connolly B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3173-3180Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Filter binding (not shown) demonstrated that replacement of uridines 20, 23, 35, and 36 with 4-thiouridine either did not affect binding or reduced it to a small extent, such that significant amounts of MetJ-RNA complex was formed at the concentrations used for photocross-linking. Although there is a great deal of interest in RNA ligands selected to bind particular target molecules with high affinity, there is, as yet, little structural information on the nature of the RNA-target complexes. In the last few years several structures have been determined for selected RNAs bound to small molecular weight ligands such as ATP, using NMR spectroscopy (35Heuss H.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). More recently the first high resolution crystal structure for a selected RNA-protein complex has been determined (14Convery M.A. Roswell S. Stonehouse N.J. Ellington A.D. Hirao I. Murray J.B. Peabody D.S. Phillips S.E.V. Stockley P.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Additionally, low resolution methods, mainly interference and protection modification combined with base substitutions, have been used to map the interfaces between proteins and selected, high affinity, RNA ligands (17Green L. Waugh S. Binkley J.P. Hostomska Z. Hostomsky Z. Tuerk C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)."
