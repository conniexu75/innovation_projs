https://openalex.org/W2126780067,"One goal of regenerative medicine is to instructively convert adult cells into other cell types for tissue repair and regeneration. Although isolated examples of adult cell reprogramming are known, there is no general understanding of how to turn one cell type into another in a controlled manner. Here, using a strategy of re-expressing key developmental regulators in vivo, we identify a specific combination of three transcription factors (Ngn3 (also known as Neurog3) Pdx1 and Mafa) that reprograms differentiated pancreatic exocrine cells in adult mice into cells that closely resemble beta-cells. The induced beta-cells are indistinguishable from endogenous islet beta-cells in size, shape and ultrastructure. They express genes essential for beta-cell function and can ameliorate hyperglycaemia by remodelling local vasculature and secreting insulin. This study provides an example of cellular reprogramming using defined factors in an adult organ and suggests a general paradigm for directing cell reprogramming without reversion to a pluripotent stem cell state."

https://openalex.org/W2054166086,"The slicer activity of the RNA-induced silencing complex is associated with argonaute, the RNase H-like PIWI domain of which catalyses guide-strand-mediated sequence-specific cleavage of target messenger RNA. Here we report on the crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus argonaute bound to a 5'-phosphorylated 21-base DNA guide strand, thereby identifying the nucleic-acid-binding channel positioned between the PAZ- and PIWI-containing lobes, as well as the pivot-like conformational changes associated with complex formation. The bound guide strand is anchored at both of its ends, with the solvent-exposed Watson-Crick edges of stacked bases 2 to 6 positioned for nucleation with the mRNA target, whereas two critically positioned arginines lock bases 10 and 11 at the cleavage site into an unanticipated orthogonal alignment. Biochemical studies indicate that key amino acid residues at the active site and those lining the 5'-phosphate-binding pocket made up of the Mid domain are critical for cleavage activity, whereas alterations of residues lining the 2-nucleotide 3'-end-binding pocket made up of the PAZ domain show little effect."
https://openalex.org/W2153617971,"BTBR T+ tf/J (BTBR) is an inbred mouse strain that displays social abnormalities and repetitive behaviors analogous to the first and third diagnostic symptoms of autism. Here we investigate ultrasonic vocalizations in BTBR, to address the second diagnostic symptom of autism, communication deficits. As compared to the commonly used C57BL/6J (B6) strain, BTBR pups called more loudly and more frequently when separated from their mothers and siblings. Detailed analysis of ten categories of calls revealed an unusual pattern in BTBR as compared to B6. BTBR emitted high levels of harmonics, two-syllable, and composite calls, but minimal numbers of chevron-shaped syllables, upward, downward, and short calls. Because body weights were higher in BTBR than B6 pups, one possible explanation was that larger thoracic size was responsible for the louder calls and different distribution of syllable categories. To test this possibility, we recorded separation calls from FVB/NJ, a strain with body weights similar to BTBR, and 129X1/SvJ, a strain with body weights similar to B6. BTBR remained the outlier on number of calls, displaying low numbers of complex, upward, chevron, short, and frequency steps calls, along with high harmonics and composites. Further, developmental milestones and growth rates were accelerated in BTBR, indicating an unusual neurodevelopmental trajectory. Overall, our findings demonstrate strain-specific patterns of ultrasonic calls that may represent different lexicons, or innate variations in complex vocal repertoires, in genetically distinct strains of mice. Particularly intriguing is the unusual pattern of vocalizations and the more frequent, loud harmonics evident in the BTBR mouse model of autism that may resemble the atypical vocalizations seen in some autistic infants."
https://openalex.org/W2108035852,"Background Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to be responsible for tumor regeneration after chemotherapy, although direct confirmation of this remains forthcoming. We therefore investigated whether drug treatment could enrich and maintain CSCs and whether the high tumorogenic and metastatic abilities of CSCs were based on their marked ability to produce growth and angiogenic factors and express their cognate receptors to stimulate tumor cell proliferation and stroma formation. Methodology/Findings Treatment of lung tumor cells with doxorubicin, cisplatin, or etoposide resulted in the selection of drug surviving cells (DSCs). These cells expressed CD133, CD117, SSEA-3, TRA1-81, Oct-4, and nuclear β-catenin and lost expression of the differentiation markers cytokeratins 8/18 (CK 8/18). DSCs were able to grow as tumor spheres, maintain self-renewal capacity, and differentiate. Differentiated progenitors lost expression of CD133, gained CK 8/18 and acquired drug sensitivity. In the presence of drugs, differentiation of DSCs was abrogated allowing propagation of cells with CSC-like characteristics. Lung DSCs demonstrated high tumorogenic and metastatic potential following inoculation into SCID mice, which supported their classification as CSCs. Luminex analysis of human and murine cytokines in sonicated lysates of parental- and CSC-derived tumors revealed that CSC-derived tumors contained two- to three-fold higher levels of human angiogenic and growth factors (VEGF, bFGF, IL-6, IL-8, HGF, PDGF-BB, G-CSF, and SCGF-β). CSCs also showed elevated levels of expression of human VEGFR2, FGFR2, CXCR1, 2 and 4 receptors. Moreover, human CSCs growing in SCID mice stimulated murine stroma to produce elevated levels of angiogenic and growth factors. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that chemotherapy can lead to propagation of CSCs and prevention of their differentiation. The high tumorigenic and metastatic potentials of CSCs are associated with efficient cytokine network production that may represent a target for increased efficacy of cancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2018514799,"Cochlear hair cells form the sound-sensing apparatus of vertebrates and their loss or damage results in hearing impairment. Mammals cannot regenerate these cells, but previous work has shown that ectopic expression of the transcription factor Atonal homologue 1 (Atoh1) can induce cells that would not normally differentiate as cochlear hair cells to become hair cell-like. Now Gubbels et al. show that in utero gene transfer of Atoh1 into mouse cochleas generates ectopic hair cells in the cochlea. Importantly, these supernumerary hair cells are functionally competent and display neuronal connectivity. This is a major step towards experiments to test for the ability of gene therapies to ameliorate hearing loss in mouse models of human deafness. Sensory hair cells in the mammalian cochlea convert mechanical stimuli into electrical impulses that subserve audition1,2. Loss of hair cells and their innervating neurons is the most frequent cause of hearing impairment3. Atonal homologue 1 (encoded by Atoh1, also known as Math1) is a basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor required for hair-cell development4,5,6, and its misexpression in vitro7,8 and in vivo9,10 generates hair-cell-like cells. Atoh1-based gene therapy to ameliorate auditory10 and vestibular11 dysfunction has been proposed. However, the biophysical properties of putative hair cells induced by Atoh1 misexpression have not been characterized. Here we show that in utero gene transfer of Atoh1 produces functional supernumerary hair cells in the mouse cochlea. The induced hair cells display stereociliary bundles, attract neuronal processes and express the ribbon synapse marker carboxy-terminal binding protein 2 (refs 12,13). Moreover, the hair cells are capable of mechanoelectrical transduction1,2 and show basolateral conductances with age-appropriate specializations. Our results demonstrate that manipulation of cell fate by transcription factor misexpression produces functional sensory cells in the postnatal mammalian cochlea. We expect that our in utero gene transfer paradigm will enable the design and validation of gene therapies to ameliorate hearing loss in mouse models of human deafness14,15."
https://openalex.org/W1994387974,"Coral reefs have emerged as one of the ecosystems most vulnerable to climate variation and change. While the contribution of a warming climate to the loss of live coral cover has been well documented across large spatial and temporal scales, the associated effects on fish have not. Here, we respond to recent and repeated calls to assess the importance of local management in conserving coral reefs in the context of global climate change. Such information is important, as coral reef fish assemblages are the most species dense vertebrate communities on earth, contributing critical ecosystem functions and providing crucial ecosystem services to human societies in tropical countries. Our assessment of the impacts of the 1998 mass bleaching event on coral cover, reef structural complexity, and reef associated fishes spans 7 countries, 66 sites and 26 degrees of latitude in the Indian Ocean. Using Bayesian meta-analysis we show that changes in the size structure, diversity and trophic composition of the reef fish community have followed coral declines. Although the ocean scale integrity of these coral reef ecosystems has been lost, it is positive to see the effects are spatially variable at multiple scales, with impacts and vulnerability affected by geography but not management regime. Existing no-take marine protected areas still support high biomass of fish, however they had no positive affect on the ecosystem response to large-scale disturbance. This suggests a need for future conservation and management efforts to identify and protect regional refugia, which should be integrated into existing management frameworks and combined with policies to improve system-wide resilience to climate variation and change."
https://openalex.org/W2091475867,"Background The loss of vision has been associated with enhanced performance in non-visual tasks such as tactile discrimination and sound localization. Current evidence suggests that these functional gains are linked to the recruitment of the occipital visual cortex for non-visual processing, but the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these crossmodal changes remain uncertain. One possible explanation is that visual deprivation is associated with an unmasking of non-visual input into visual cortex. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the effect of sudden, complete and prolonged visual deprivation (five days) in normally sighted adult individuals while they were immersed in an intensive tactile training program. Following the five-day period, blindfolded subjects performed better on a Braille character discrimination task. In the blindfold group, serial fMRI scans revealed an increase in BOLD signal within the occipital cortex in response to tactile stimulation after five days of complete visual deprivation. This increase in signal was no longer present 24 hours after blindfold removal. Finally, reversible disruption of occipital cortex function on the fifth day (by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; rTMS) impaired Braille character recognition ability in the blindfold group but not in non-blindfolded controls. This disruptive effect was no longer evident once the blindfold had been removed for 24 hours. Conclusions/Significance Overall, our findings suggest that sudden and complete visual deprivation in normally sighted individuals can lead to profound, but rapidly reversible, neuroplastic changes by which the occipital cortex becomes engaged in processing of non-visual information. The speed and dynamic nature of the observed changes suggests that normally inhibited or masked functions in the sighted are revealed by visual loss. The unmasking of pre-existing connections and shifts in connectivity represent rapid, early plastic changes, which presumably can lead, if sustained and reinforced, to slower developing, but more permanent structural changes, such as the establishment of new neural connections in the blind."
https://openalex.org/W2121436831,"The strength and duration of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling is regulated through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by dedicated dual-specificity kinases and phosphatases, respectively. Here we investigated the physiological role that extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) dephosphorylation plays in vivo through targeted disruption of the gene encoding dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (Dusp6) in the mouse. Dusp6(-/-) mice, which were viable, fertile, and otherwise overtly normal, showed an increase in basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the heart, spleen, kidney, brain, and fibroblasts, but no change in ERK5, p38, or c-Jun N-terminal kinases activation. However, loss of Dusp6 did not increase or prolong ERK1/2 activation after stimulation, suggesting that its function is more dedicated to basal ERK1/2 signaling tone. In-depth analysis of the physiological effect associated with increased baseline ERK1/2 signaling was performed in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and the heart. Interestingly, mice lacking Dusp6 had larger hearts at every age examined, which was associated with greater rates of myocyte proliferation during embryonic development and in the early postnatal period, resulting in cardiac hypercellularity. This increase in myocyte content in the heart was protective against decompensation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy following long term pressure overload and myocardial infarction injury in adult mice. Dusp6(-/-) MEFs also showed reduced apoptosis rates compared with wild-type MEFs. These results demonstrate that ERK1/2 signaling is physiologically restrained by DUSP6 in coordinating cellular development and survival characteristics, directly impacting disease-responsiveness in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W1969410032,"Phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K) has been widely studied as a principal regulator of cell polarization, migration, and chemotaxis [1], [2], [3], [4]. Surprisingly, recent studies showed that mammalian neutrophils and Dictyostelium discoideum cells can polarize and migrate in the absence of PI3K activity [5], [6], [7]. Here we directly probe the roles of PI3K and its downstream effector, Rac, in HL-60 neutrophils by using a chemical biology approach whereby the endogenously present enzymes are synthetically activated in less than one minute [8], [9], [10]. We show that uniform activation of endogenous PI3K is sufficient to polarize previously unpolarized neutrophils and trigger effective cell migration. After a delay following symmetrical phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3) production, a polarized distribution of PIP3 was induced by positive feedback requiring actin polymerization. Pharmacological studies argue that this process does not require receptor-coupled trimeric G proteins. Contrary to the current working model, rapid activation of endogenous Rac proteins triggered effective actin polymerization but failed to feed back to PI3K to generate PIP3 or induce cell polarization. Thus, the increase in PIP3 concentration at the leading edge is generated by positive feedback with an AND gate logic with a PI3K-Rac-actin polymerization pathway as a first input and a PI3K initiated non-Rac pathway as a second input. This AND-gate control for cell polarization can explain how Rac can be employed for both PI3K-dependent and -independent signaling pathways coexisting in the same cell."
https://openalex.org/W2054147049,"KLF6 (Kruppel-like factor 6) is a zinc finger transcription factor and a tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in prostate cancer. KLF6 suppresses tumor growth and induces apoptosis in cancer cells through mechanisms still not defined. Here we show that KLF6 induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells by ATF3 (activating transcription factor 3) expression. KLF6 binds directly to and activates the ATF3 promoter. ATF3 induced apoptosis when ectopically expressed in cells, whereas knockdown of ATF3 by small interference RNA blocked KLF6-induced apoptosis. KLF6 mutants derived from clinical prostate cancers failed to activate the ATF3 promoter and were unable to induce apoptosis. Furthermore, stress conditions (exposure to staurosporine and hypoxia induced by sodium azide) caused significant increase in ATF3 expression and induced apoptosis, whereas knockdown of KLF6 by small interference RNA blocked the increase of ATF3 as well as the induction of apoptosis in these conditions. Thus, ATF3 is a key mediator of KLF6-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W3085129072,"CD44 is an important adhesion molecule that functions as the major hyaluronan receptor which mediates cell adhesion and migration in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Although full activity of CD44 requires binding to ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) proteins, the CD44 cytoplasmic region, consisting of 72 amino acid residues, lacks the Motif-1 consensus sequence for ERM binding found in intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-2 and other adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Ultracentrifugation sedimentation studies and circular dichroism measurements revealed an extended monomeric form of the cytoplasmic peptide in solution. The crystal structure of the radixin FERM domain complexed with a CD44 cytoplasmic peptide reveals that the KKKLVIN sequence of the peptide forms a β strand followed by a short loop structure that binds subdomain C of the FERM domain. Like Motif-1 binding, the CD44 β strand binds the shallow groove between strand β5C and helix α1C and augments the β sheet β5C-β7C from subdomain C. Two hydrophobic CD44 residues, Leu and Ile, are docked into a hydrophobic pocket with the formation of hydrogen bonds between Asn of the CD44 short loop and loop β4C-β5C from subdomain C. This binding mode resembles that of NEP (neutral endopeptidase 24.11) rather than ICAM-2.

Increasing evidence has shown that interactions between CD44 and ERM proteins are associated with normal physiological cell adhesion and migration functions in addition to bacterial infection and cancer progression (5Martin T.A. Harrison G. Mansel R.E. Jiang W.G. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2003; 46: 165-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 6Ponta H. Sherman L. Herrlich P.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Importantly, a minimal cytoplasmic region projecting from a transmembrane helix is required for efficient hyaluronan binding (21Lesley J. He Q. Miyake K. Hamann A. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. J. Exp.

Moreover, these highly conserved transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions are required for events downstream of hyaluronan binding through regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) 5The abbreviations used are: RIP, regulated intramembrane proteolysis; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; PTB, phosphotyrosine binding; ICD, intracellular domain; DTT, dithiothreitol; HABD, hyaluronan-binding domain. (25Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar), which produces a CD44 intracellular domain (ICD) fragment that translocates into the nucleus and stimulates transcription via direct interactions with the transcriptional machinery (26Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Murakami D. Sasayama T. Araki N. Miki T. Wong A.J. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, the physicochemical and structural features of the ICD fragment, which encompasses the whole cytoplasmic region, are unknown. ERM proteins comprise three domains, an N-terminal FERM (4.1 and ERM) domain, a central α-helical domain, and a C-terminal tail domain. The FERM domain interacts with the plasma membrane and specifically binds a variety of adhesion molecules, including CD44, whereas the C-terminal tail domain binds to F-actin. The FERM domain is well conserved in all members of ERM proteins and merlin and is believed to bind the same target proteins. The C-terminal tail domain, however, is not well conserved in merlin and shows little association with F-actin (15McClatchey A.I. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 27Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Major binding targets of the FERM domain are adhesion molecules classified as type I membrane proteins. Biochemical studies have shown that the FERM domain binds the cytoplasmic regions of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), ICAM-2, and ICAM-3 of the immunoglobulin superfamily as well as CD44 and CD43/leukosialin/sialophorin (13Yonemura S. Hirao M. Doi Y. Takahashi N. Kondo T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The first crystal of the FERM domain bound to the target adhesion molecule was obtained using the full-length ICAM-2 cytoplasmic peptide comprising 28 residues (28Hamada K. Shimizu T. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). An x-ray structural study has shown how the radixin FERM domain binds the juxtamembrane region of the ICAM-2 cytoplasmic peptide (28Hamada K. Shimizu T. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). On the basis of crystal structure and mutation studies, the Motif-1 sequence motif RXXTYXVXXA is proposed as binding to the FERM domain. The ICAM-2 Motif-1 sequence forms a β strand (XXTY) that mediates anti-parallel β-β interactions with the FERM domain and a 310-helix (VXXA) that docks into a hydrophobic pocket. Motif-1 is found in other adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily containing VCAM-1 and L1-CAM and proteoglycans such as syndecan and neurexin. All of these adhesion molecules are shown to bind the radixin FERM domain. Recently, PSGL-1 (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1) has been shown to maintain a Motif-1-related sequence that binds the FERM domain (29Takai Y. Kitano K. Terawaki S. Maesaki R. Hakoshima T. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 1329-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CD44 retains neither Motif-1 nor Motif-2, MDWXXXXX(L/I)FXX(L/F), which has recently been identified in the FERM-binding region of Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1 and -2 (NHERF-1 and -2) (30Terawaki S. Maesaki R. Hakoshima T. Structure. 2006; 14: 777-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, the precise binding mode of CD44 to the FERM domain remains unclear. We report here on physicochemical and hydrodynamic analyses of the CD44 cytoplasmic peptide and the crystal structure of the radixin FERM domain complexed with a CD44 juxtamembrane peptide. We show that the CD44 cytoplasmic peptide is present as a monomeric random coil in solution. In the complex crystal, the CD44 peptide binds subdomain C of the radixin FERM domain. The CD44 binding site overlaps with that of the Motif-1 binding site found in previous complexed structures (28Hamada K. Shimizu T. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 29Takai Y. Kitano K. Terawaki S. Maesaki R. Hakoshima T. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 1329-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), whereas the binding mode of CD44 to the FERM domain is distinct from that of ICAM-2 and resembles that of the recently reported NEP (neutral endopeptidase 24.11) (31Terawaki S. Kitano K. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 19854-19861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results, taken together with analyses of our previous structures, define a characteristic versatility of peptide recognition by the radixin FERM domain, which is distinct from the talin FERM domain (32Wegener K.L.

Furthermore, in addressing how phosphorylation may interfere with binding to ERM proteins, we suggest a mechanism by which RIP-mediated cleavage of the CD44 cytoplasmic peptide facilitates nuclear translocation for transcriptional activation. Finally, we suggest a structural basis for Smad1 interactions with activated CD44 bound to ERM protein and linked to actin cytoskeletons. Protein Preparation—The region of cDNA coding for the cytoplasmic region of mouse CD44 (residues 292-363) was subcloned into pGEX4T-1 or pGEX6P-3 plasmid (GE Healthcare) using the BamHI and SmaI restriction enzyme sites. The CD44 cytoplasmic peptide was expressed in BL21(DE3)RIL cells (Stratagene) as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. Cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μgml-1 ampicillin and 50 μgml-1 chloramphenicol. When the OD660 of the cell culture reached 0.8, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 1 mm to induce expression of the CD44 gene. Cells were grown at 30 °C for an additional 5 h following isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction and then collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm (Beckman J2-M1 JA10 rotor) for 15 min at 4 °C. Wet cells expressing CD44 peptide were suspended in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm EDTA, and 1.5% Sarkosyl and then disrupted by sonication at 4 °C. The soluble portion of the cell extract was then loaded onto a glutathione S-transferase affinity column comprising glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (GSH resin) (GE Healthcare) and then washed copiously with 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.3) containing 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA. Bound glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was cleaved from the GSH resin using 5 units ml-1 thrombin (Sigma) for 8 h or 2 units ml-1 HRV3C protease (Novagen) for 18 h at 4°C. The cleaved sample was collected and purified by chromatography using HiTrap SP (GE Healthcare) and HiPrep 26/10 desalting (GE Healthcare) with 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm NaCl and 0.5 mm DTT. Purified CD44 peptide was concentrated using Microsep™ centrifugal devices 1K (Pall Corp.). The peptide sample was divided into 50-μl aliquots in 0.5-ml tubes (Eppendorf) and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen samples were stored at -80 °C until use. The radixin FERM domain was expressed in E. coli cells and purified as described previously (33Hamada K. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56 (a): 922-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration—The molecular size of the recombinant CD44 cytoplasmic peptide was examined using gravity flow gel filtration techniques. CD44 was chromatographed at 4 °C through a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) with buffer C containing 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA. The molecular mass was determined on the basis of the elution volume from a plot of log (molecular mass) of standard proteins, comprising bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B-12 (1.4 kDa) (Bio-Rad), versus the elution volume. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra of the purified CD44 cytoplasmic peptide were recorded at 4 °C using a Jasco J720W spectropolarimeter. The CD44 cytoplasmic peptide was dissolved in 5 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm NaCl, 0.7 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol or containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.7 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The CD44 cytoplasmic peptide and the FERM domain were mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio (13 μm:13 μm) and dissolved in 5 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.7 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Secondary structure estimations were calculated using the Jasco secondary structure estimation software. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation experiments were performed at 10 °C using a Beckman Coulter Optima XLA analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an An-60 Ti rotor and double sector centerpieces. Purified samples of the CD44 cytoplasmic peptide were dissolved in 5 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.8) containing 50 mm NaCl and 2 mm DTT (TSD buffer) at a sample concentration of 0.5 mg ml-1 and then centrifuged at 42,000 rpm. Radial absorbance scans were measured every 15 min at a wavelength of 230 nm. The resultant data were analyzed using the programs Sedfit and Sednterp. To glean further insight into the CD44 conformation in the FERM-bound state, similar experiments were performed for the FERM domain in the free and the CD44-bound forms in 5 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl at 20 °C. Sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation experiments were performed at 10 °C using the same ultracentrifuge and rotor as described above. Six-sector centerpieces were used. The CD44 cytoplasmic peptide was dissolved in TSD buffer at sample concentrations of 0.0625, 0.125, and 0.25 mg ml-1 and then centrifuged at 32,000, 38,000, 40,000, and 48,000 rpm. Radial absorbance scans were measured at 230 nm after 22 h, at which time equilibrium had been achieved. The resultant data were analyzed using XLA/XL-I data analysis software. Structural Determination of the FERM-CD44 Complex—Preparation and crystallization of the radixin FERM domain complexed with the CD44 cytoplasmic peptide were as previously described (34Mori T. Kitano K. Terawaki S. Maesaki R. Hakoshima T. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2007; 63: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Confirmation that the resulting crystals contained the FERM domain and CD44 peptide was achieved using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (PerSeptive Inc.). Diffraction tests of crystals were performed at 100 K using a Rigaku R-Axis IV detector equipped with a Rigaku FR-E x-ray generator. Rodlike crystals grown in 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.6) containing 15% polyethylene glycol 3350 and 0.2 m potassium thiocyanate were shown to diffract to 2.1 Å resolution using a Rigaku MSC Jupiter 210 detector installed on beamline BL38B1 at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan).

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Phases were determined by molecular replacement using the program PHASER (36McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) with the free form structure of the FERM domain as a search model (37Hamada K. Shimizu T. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4449-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The procedure gave a clear solution corresponding to one FERM molecule in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. The calculated molecular replacement maps showed definite residual electron densities for the CD44 peptide at the groove between strand β5C and helix α1C of subdomain C of the FERM domain in both 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc maps. CD44 peptide residues were modeled manually using O (38Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The complex structure was refined by simulated annealing, followed by restrained individual B-factor refinement performed using the program CNS (39Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The stereochemical quality of the model was assessed using the program PROCHECK. In the Ramachandran plot, 89.8 and 9.9% of residues were located within the most favored and additional allowed regions, respectively. One exceptional outlier was flagged in the plot, that of Asp252 located within a type II reverse turn between strands β5C and β6C. This outlier repeatedly appeared in the FERM domain structures of radixin (28Hamada K. Shimizu T. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T.

Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), and merlin (41Shimizu T. Seto A. Maita N. Hamada K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10332-10336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We also checked our structure with MolProbity (42Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall W.B. 3rd, Snoeyink J. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W375-W383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3030) Google Scholar). In the Ramachandran plot, 96.3, 3.3, and 0.3% (Lys296 but not Asp252) of the residues fell in favored, allowed, and outlier regions. Thus, judgment of outliers in our structure is subtle. Molecular illustrations were prepared using the program PyMOL (DeLano Scientific). Superposition of the FERM domains and peptides were performed using the program Lsqkab (43Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Pull-down Assay of the Radixin FERM Domain with Wild-type, S2D, and S2p CD44 Peptides—N-terminal biotinylated CD44 cytoplasmic peptides were purchased from Toray Research Center (Tokyo, Japan) for the in vitro binding assay. The wild-type peptide is the same as that used in the x-ray structural work. The S2p peptide contains phosphoserine at position 2, and the S2D mutant peptide contains a negatively charged aspartic acid that mimics the phosphorylated state of Ser2. Pull-down assays were performed using Streptavidin-Sepharose high performance resin (GE Healthcare). For each reaction, 25 μl of the resin was mixed with 25 pmol of each N-terminal biotinylated peptide and suspended in 1 ml of 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 70 mm KCl and 1 mm DTT (pull-down buffer) in a 1.5-ml tube (Eppendorf). Resin free from bound peptide was used as the control. The resin was harvested as a pellet by centrifugation (2000 × g for 1 min). After removing the supernatant, the resin was suspended in 1 ml of pull-down buffer again, and this wash was repeated two times. 25 μl of 100 μm FERM domain dissolved in pull-down buffer was added to the resin. The resin was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with occasional mixing and then washed two times with pull-down buffer by centrifugation. To elute the streptavidin-bound peptide and its associated FERM domain, 25 μl of SDS-sample buffer was added to recovered resin, and then each sample was incubated for 5 min at 96 °C. The amount of streptavidin in each eluate was determined by SDS-PAGE, and eluted proteins were visualized using SimplyBlue™SafeStain (Invitrogen). An appropriate amount of each eluate containing the same amount of streptavidin was then subjected to SDS-PAGE. The amount of bound FERM domain was determined by densitometric scanning using the software Image J 1.36b. The relative amount of the FERM domain bound per streptavidin was calculated, and the amount of FERM domain bound to the control resin was subtracted from each eluate. This pull-down assay was performed three times, and the average amount of FERM domain binding to each peptide was estimated. Binding Assay—The binding affinity for the 23-residue CD44 peptide was examined by using equilibrium surface plasmon resonance measurements, which were carried out on a Biacore Biosensor instrument (Biacore 3000; GE Healthcare), as previously described (30Terawaki S. Maesaki R. Hakoshima T. Structure. 2006; 14: 777-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The human merlin FERM domain was purified as described previously (41Shimizu T. Seto A. Maita N. Hamada K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10332-10336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The biotinylated peptide of the juxtamembrane region (23 residues of mouse CD44; see Fig. 5A) was purchased from Sawady Technology (Tokyo, Japan). The peptide was coupled via the N-terminal biotin moiety to a streptavidin-coated sensor chip (sensor chip SA Biacore AB). The purified FERM domain (5-1280 nm) was injected into both peptide-linked and nonlinked sensor chips for correction of background signals. All binding experiments were performed at 25 °C with a flow rate of 20 μl/min in buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.005% surfactant P20. The kinetic parameters were evaluated by using the BIA evaluation software (GE Healthcare). The KD values were obtained by averaging of at least three independent measurements. The obtained KD values for FERM binding to the 23-residue CD44 peptide are 110 ± 9 nm (melin) and 120 ± 9 nm (radixin). Conformational Properties of the CD44 Cytoplasmic Peptide in Solution—The structural features of the CD44 cytoplasmic region, comprising 72 amino acid residues, are largely unknown. One intriguing question relates to whether this longer cytoplasmic peptide forms a stable compact domain that possesses the ability of self-association to form dimeric or oligomeric structures. In an effort to address these uncertainties, analytical ultracentrifugation methods were employed to investigate the assembly state of the whole cytoplasmic peptide and to determine the approximate shape of the molecule/assembly in solution. Sedimentation equilibrium analyses resulted in an excellent fit of the observed absorbance data with the calculated curve based on an ideal single-species model (Fig. 1A). The obtained molecular mass of 8.8 kDa is close to the theoretical value (8.382 kDa) and suggests that the CD44 peptide adopts a monomeric form in solution. Sedimentation velocity measurements showed the presence of a single boundary, which suggests monodispersity of the sample containing the molecular species with a sedimentation"
https://openalex.org/W2091676281,"Somatostatin is important in the regulation of diverse neuroendocrine functions. Based on bioinformatic analyses of evolutionarily conserved sequences, we predicted another peptide hormone in pro-somatostatin and named it neuronostatin. Immuno-affinity purification allowed the sequencing of an amidated neuronostatin peptide of 13 residues from porcine tissues. In vivo treatment with neuronostatin induced c-Fos expression in gastrointestinal tissues, anterior pituitary, cerebellum, and hippocampus. In vitro treatment with neuronostatin promoted the migration of cerebellar granule cells and elicited direct depolarizing actions on paraventricular neurons in hypothalamic slices. In a gastric tumor cell line, neuronostatin induced c-Fos expression, stimulated SRE reporter activity, and promoted cell proliferation. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular treatment with neuronostatin increased blood pressure but suppressed food intake and water drinking. Our findings demonstrate diverse neuronal, neuroendocrine, and cardiovascular actions of a somatostatin gene-encoded hormone and provide the basis to investigate the physiological roles of this endogenously produced brain/gut peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1980555852,"We studied molecular and functional properties of Arabidopsis phosphomannose isomerase isoenzymes (PMI1 and PMI2) that catalyze reversible isomerization between d-fructose 6-phosphate and d-mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6P). The apparent Km and Vmax values for Man-6P of purified recombinant PMI1 were 41.3 ± 4.2 μm and 1.89 μmol/min/mg protein, respectively, whereas those of purified recombinant PMI2 were 372 ± 13 μm and 22.5 μmol/min/mg protein, respectively. Both PMI1 and PMI2 were inhibited by incubation with EDTA, Zn2+, Cd2+, and l-ascorbic acid (AsA). Arabidopsis PMI1 protein was constitutively expressed in both vegetative and reproductive organs under normal growth conditions, whereas the PMI2 protein was not expressed in any organs under light. The induction of PMI1 expression and an increase in the AsA level were observed in leaves under continuous light, whereas the induction of PMI2 expression and a decrease in the AsA level were observed under long term darkness. PMI1 showed a diurnal expression pattern in parallel with the total PMI activity and the total AsA content in leaves. Moreover, a reduction of PMI1 expression through RNA interference resulted in a substantial decrease in the total AsA content of leaves of knockdown PMI1 plants, whereas the complete inhibition of PMI2 expression did not affect the total AsA levels in leaves of knock-out PMI2 plants. Consequently, this study improves our understanding of the molecular and functional properties of Arabidopsis PMI isoenzymes and provides genetic evidence of the involvement of PMI1, but not PMI2, in the biosynthesis of AsA in Arabidopsis plants.

In photosynthetic organisms, including higher plants, AsA is one of the major soluble carbohydrates and antioxidants, and it plays roles in essential physiological processes such as photosynthesis, trans-membrane electron transport, cell division and growth, and stress resistance (1Smirnoff N.

Biochem. 2008; 72: 1143-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In higher plants, AsA is synthesized from hexose phosphates such as d-glucose-1 or 6-phosphate and d-fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6P) via GDP-d-mannose (GDP-Man), by the d-mannose/l-galactose (d-Man/l-Gal) pathway (3Wheeler G.L.

GDP-Man is synthesized from Fru-6P in three steps catalyzed by the enzymes, phosphomannose isomerase (PMI), phosphomannomutase (PMM), and GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase (GMP) (5Conklin P.L. Pallanca J.E.

Plant J. 2007; 49: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). GDP-Man is successively converted to GDP-l-Gal, l-Gal-1-phosphate, l-Gal, l-galactono-1,4-lactone, and finally to AsA. In addition to this pathway, alternative pathways may contribute to AsA biosynthesis. Overexpression of a rat l-gulono-1,4-lactone oxidase resulted in 4–7-fold increase in the AsA content (8Jain A.K. Nessler C.L. Mol. Breed. 2000; 6: 73-78Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). GDP-Man-3′,5′-epimerase (GME), which is in the d-Man/l-Gal pathway, produces not only GDP-l-Gal but also GDP-l-gulose from GDP-Man (9Wolucka B.A. Van Montagu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47483-47490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). l-Gulose, as well as l-Gal, can be oxidized to AsA (10Davey M.W. Gilot C. Persiau G. Østergaard J. Han Y. Bauw G.C. van Montagu M. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), but it is not clear what the relative contributions of these pathways are in vivo. Although myo-inositol was not considered as a major precursor to AsA, the constitutive expression of a myo-inositol oxygenase enhanced the AsA content of the Arabidopsis leaves 2–3-fold (11Lorence A. Chevone B. Mendes P. Nessler C.L. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1200-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that overexpression of a purple acid phosphatase gene, AtPAP15, which is involved in myo-inositol metabolism, resulted in a 2-fold increase in the AsA content of the Arabidopsis (12Zhang W. Gruszewski H.A. Chevone B.I. Nessler C.L. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), suggesting that this myo-inositol pathway may also be operating in planta.

The mechanism regulating the size of the AsA pool and the expression and regulatory properties of the enzymes involved are the next important subjects of study (4Ishikawa T. Dowdle J. Smirnoff N. Physiol. Plant. 2006; 126: 343-355Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 20Smirnoff N. Conklin P.L. Loewus F.A. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. Plant. Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Leaves exposed to intense light contain more AsA than leaves in the shade (19Dowdle J. Ishikawa T. Gatzek S. Rolinski S. Smirnoff N. Plant. J. 2007; 52: 673-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 21Bartoli C.G. Yu J. Gómez F. Fernández L. McIntosh L. Foyer C.H. J. Exp. Bot. 2006; 57: 1621-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported that the transcript levels of GMP, VTC4, and the VTC2 genes changed in parallel with the changes in leaf AsA pool size during dark and light periods, and the photosynthetic electron transport (PET) was closely linked to the regulation of the expression of these genes and AsA levels in leaves of Arabidopsis plants (22Yabuta Y.

Bot. 2000; 345: 669-674Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have reported that the rate of AsA biosynthesis from d-[U-14C]glucose decreased linearly with the increase in the pool size of AsA in embryonic pea seedlings. In fact, l-Gal dehydrogenase and GME, which are in the d-Man/l-Gal pathway, were inhibited by AsA (9Wolucka B.A. Van Montagu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47483-47490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 25Mieda T. Yabuta Y. Madhusudhan R. Motoki T. Takeda T. Yoshimura K. Ishikawa T. Shigeoka S. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 1271-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the AsA level in plant cells is regulated at several steps by a feedback control. In addition, it has been reported that other biological factors, such as jasmonic acid, contribute to the accumulation of AsA (26Reinbothe S. Mollenhauer B. Reinbothe C. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 27Turner J.G. Ellis C. Devoto A.

To date, the enzymes involved in the d-Man/l-Gal pathway have been identified and characterized, except for PMI, which catalyzes the reversible isomerization of Fru-6P and d-Man-6-phosphate (Man-6P) as the first step of the GDP-Man and AsA biosynthetic pathway. Earlier reports have indicated that PMI was lacking in many plants, and even if it was present, the enzyme activity was very low (29Herold A. Lewis D.H. New Phytol. 1977; 79: 1-40Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Additionally, an alternative pathway of GDP-Man and AsA synthesis via a GDP-d-glucose-2-epimerase, which does not involve PMI, GMP, and PMM, has been suggested in higher plants (30Dalessandro G. Piro G. Northcote D.H. Planta. 1986; 169: 564-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, Sharples and Fry (31Sharples S.C. Fry S.C. Plant. J. 2007; 52: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) demonstrated by a dual radiolabeling analysis that in Arabidopsis plants, the action of PMI significantly predominates over that of the GDP-d-glucose 2-epimerase. The Arabidopsis vtc1 mutant had reduced GMP activity, and a null mutation of this gene resulted in death by arresting embryonic development at a very early stage (32Lukowitz W. Nickle T.C. Meinke D.W. Last R.L. Conklin P.L. Somerville C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2262-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Moreover, pmm-12 mutant with markedly decreased activity of PMM had reduced levels of AsA in Arabidopsis (33Hoeberichts F.A. Vaeck E. Kiddle G. Coppens E. van de Cotte B. Adamantidis A. Ormenese S. Foyer C.H. Zabeau M. Inzé D. Périlleux C. Van Breusegem F. Vuylsteke M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5708-5718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although these biochemical and genetic findings suggest that the pathway from hexose phosphates to GDP-Man involved in PMI, GMP, and PMM is essential for the biosynthesis of AsA in higher plants, very little is known about PMI in higher plants. Two putative genes are identified in A. thaliana (PMI1, At3g02570, and PMI2, At1g67070) based on sequence homology. In this study, we studied the molecular characterization of recombinant PMI1 and PMI2 proteins purified from Escherichia coli and expression patterns of PMI1 and PMI2 in Arabidopsis leaves under light or darkness. Next, using reverse genetic approaches, we examined the physiological function of each enzyme, particularly with respect to AsA biosynthesis, in Arabidopsis plants. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize PMI isoenzymes in plants and represents the final piece in the puzzle of how AsA is produced in the d-Man/l-Gal pathway. Plant Materials and Growth Conditions—Surface-sterilized A. thaliana wild-type (Col-0) and transgenic seeds were sown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium plus 3% sucrose. Plates were stratified in darkness for 2 days at 4 °C and then transferred to a growth chamber kept at 25 °C during 16 h of light (100μmol/m2/s) and at 22 °C during 8 h of darkness. After 7 days, seedlings were potted in soil and grown under the same conditions. A T-DNA insertion line for PMI2 in the Col-0 background (SALK_070922) was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. The continuous light irradiation or dark application was started 4 h after the illumination. Cycloheximide (CHI) at 10 μm and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-ll-dimethylurea (DCMU) at 10 μm were used for detached leaf experiments. The detached leaves were floated on CHI or DCMU solution in Petri dishes. Preparation of Total RNA and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA was semi-automatically purified from various organs of Arabidopsis plants using a QuickGene RNA cultured cell kit and Quick-Gene-Mini80 (FujiFilm Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The first strand cDNA was synthesized using ReverTra Ace (reverse transcriptase; Toyobo) with an oligo(dT) primer. These analyses were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Arabidopsis PMI Isoenzymes—The open reading frames of PMI1 and PMI2 were amplified from the first strand cDNAs, using the following primer sets: PMI1-SacI-F (5′-GAGCTCATGGAGATCGCTACTGTCGT-3′), PMI1-XbaI-R (5′-TCTAGACTATAGAGGAAACAAAAACCTACTG-3′), PMI2-NdeI-F (5′-CATATGGGAGCAGACGCAATCCA-3′), and PMI2-SalI-F (5′-GTCGACTAGCCTACAATGTTTGG-3′). The amplified DNA fragments were ligated into the vector pZErO-2 (Invitrogen). DNA sequencing was performed using the dideoxy chain terminator method with an automatic DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM™ 310, Applied Biosystems). The resulting constructs were digested with SacI/XbaI for PMI1 or NdeI/SalI for PMI2, and ligated into the expression vector, pCold II (Takara), to produce histidine-tagged proteins. The E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS transformed with pCold II/PMI1 and -2 was grown in 50 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. After an overnight culture at 37 °C, the cultures were transferred to 500 ml of LB medium (with the antibiotics) and grown to an A600 between 0.4 and 0.6, and then cells were kept for 30 min at 16 °C without shaking. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the cultures at a concentration of 0.2 mm, and the cells were further incubated for 24 h at 16 °C with shaking. The harvested cells were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer A), sonicated (10 kHz) using 20-s strokes with 30-s intervals, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The hexa-histidine-tagged recombinant PMI proteins were purified from the soluble fraction using a HiTrap chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the column was washed with 10 ml of distilled water, charged with 0.5 ml of 0.1 mm NiCl2, and washed again with 5 ml of distilled water. After preparation, the column was equilibrated with 10 volumes of buffer A. The sample was applied using a syringe, and the column was washed with 10 volumes of buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole. The recombinant protein was eluted with 5–10 volumes of buffer A containing 120 mm imidazole, and collected in a 1-ml fraction. Protein concentrations were determined following the method of Bradford (34Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216068) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out on 12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide slab gels. The gels were stained with 0.06% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 50% (v/v) methanol for 5 min. Samples were denatured by boiling for 10 min in 0.1% SDS in the presence of 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. Enzyme Assay—The activity of PMI was measured at 25 °C using a coupled assay in which the product Fru-6P is converted into d-glucose 6-phosphate. This is then oxidized to 6-phosphogluconate, and the reduction of NADP+ was measured by the change in absorption at 340 nm (35Wells T.N.C. Coulin F. Payton M.A. Proudfoot A.E.I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1294-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The coupling enzyme, phosphoglucose isomerase or glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, was normally used at 1 unit in the enzyme assay (total volume, 1 ml), except at the highest or lowest temperature and pH, and at the highest concentration of several inhibitors, where five times this quantity was used (5 units per assay). Careful control experiments were conducted to check this assumption by adding further excess of the coupling enzymes in the presence of the inhibitor. The buffer used was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 0.5 mm NADP+. Following the preincubation of various compounds, including inhibitors such as zinc ion, at 25 °C for 30 min in the reaction mixture, the reaction was initiated by the addition of Man-6P. The optimum pH was determined at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.5–9.0, and 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 5.5–7.0. The optimum temperature was determined by incubation between 25 and 65 °C with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The total PMI activity in Arabidopsis was measured according to the method of Dowdle et al. (19Dowdle J. Ishikawa T. Gatzek S. Rolinski S. Smirnoff N. Plant. J. 2007; 52: 673-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) with minor modifications, and Man-6P was used at a final concentration of 1 mm. The activity of Fru-6P isomerization was determined by high performance anion exchange chromatography coupled with pulsed amperometric detection system using an ICS-3000 ion chromatography system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). The mixture of the enzymatic products (10 μl) was automatically injected onto the column of CarboPac PA1 guard (2 × 50 mm) and CarboPac PA1 (2 × 250 mm) and eluted with NaOH/sodium acetate gradient. The sodium acetate gradient was increased from 0 to 200 mm between 0 and 10 min and to 400 mm between 10 and 24 min with a flow rate set at 0.25 ml/min. The detection was carried out by pulsed amperometry cell using electrochemical detector equipped with a working gold electrode and a combined pH-Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—The quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed according to Nishizawa et al. (36Nishizawa A. Yabuta Y. Yoshida E. Maruta T. Yoshimura K. Shigeoka S. Plant J. 2006; 48: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Primer pairs for the quantitative RT-PCR were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems), and primer sequences were as follows: Actin2-F (5′-GGCAAGTCATCACGATTGG-3′), Actin2-R (5′-CAGCTTCCATTCCCACAAAC-3′); PMI1-rF (5′-GTGGAGCCTCGACGGTGTT-3′), PMI1-rR (5′-TCCTTCACCTTGGAGTACAAGCA-3′); and PMI2-rF (5′-AGCAAGTGGTTTCTCGGATGAA-3′), PMI2-rR (5′-AACCAACTTCTCTTTCTCCGACAGT-3′). Gene-specific primers were chosen such that the resulting PCR product was ∼100 bp long. The quantitative RT-PCR was performed with an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), using the SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara). Actin2 mRNA, set to 100%, was used as an internal standard in all experiments. The quantitative RT-PCR experiments were repeated at least three times for cDNA prepared from three batches of plants. Western Blot Analysis—Polyclonal mouse antibodies against PMI1 (anti-PMI1) and PMI2 (anti-PMI2) protein were prepared using His-tagged recombinant proteins. Mice were injected with 50 mg of purified recombinant PMI1 or PMI2 proteins emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant followed by three subcutaneous injections. After bleedings, the antisera were separated from the blood (37Yoshimura K. Miyao K. Gaber A. Takeda T. Kanaboshi H. Miyasaka H. Shigeoka S. Plant J. 2004; 37: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously (33Hoeberichts F.A. Vaeck E. Kiddle G. Coppens E. van de Cotte B. Adamantidis A. Ormenese S. Foyer C.H. Zabeau M. Inzé D. Périlleux C. Van Breusegem F. Vuylsteke M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5708-5718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The protein bands were detected by using specific antibodies as the primary antibody, and anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) as the secondary antibody. Measurement of AsA and Dehydroascorbic Acid Levels—AsA and DHA were measured as described by Yabuta et al. (22Yabuta Y. Mieda T. Rapolu M. Nakamura A. Motoki T. Maruta T. Yoshimura K. Ishikawa T. Shigeoka S. J. Exp. Bot. 2007; 58: 2661-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The different tissues of Arabidopsis plants (0.5 g wet weight) frozen in liquid N2 were ground using a mortar and pestle with 5 ml of 6% (v/v) HClO4 and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. A 100-μl aliquot of the obtained leaf extract was added directly to 900 μl of a 200 mm succinate buffer (pH 12.7, adjusted with NaOH) in the spectrophotometer. The final pH was very near 6.0. The A265 was immediately recorded once and again 5 min after the addition of 5 units of AsA oxidase from Cucurbita sp. (Wako, Osaka, Japan). For the determination of total AsA, the leaf extract was adjusted to pH 6.0 with 1.25 m K2CO3 and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was incubated with 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) dissolved in 50 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.5, for 30 min at 25 °C. A 100-μl aliquot of the solution was directly added to 900 μl of 200 mm succinate buffer, pH 6.0, in the spectrophotometer. The resultant solution was assayed as described above. The difference between the total AsA and AsA contents was taken to be the DHA content. Generation of Transgenic Plants—The 5′-end of PMI1 cDNA was cloned into the donor vector, pDONR201, and then recloned into the destination vector, pGWB80. The specific primers with attB1 and attB2 sequences were as follows: 5′-PMI1-attB1 (5′-GGCGAAGCCGTCGTCGATCC-3′) and 5′-PMI1-attB2 (5′-GAGAAAAGCTTTGAGTCTTC-3′). PCR and in vitro BP and LR recombinations were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which was transformed with the obtained construct by electroporation, was used to infect Arabidopsis via the vacuum infiltration method (38Bechtold N. Pelletier G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 82: 259-266PubMed Google Scholar). T1 seedlings were selected on basic MS medium in Petri dishes containing 3% sucrose and 20 mg/liter hygromycin for 2 weeks and transferred to the soil. T2 seeds were harvested and used for the experiments. Characterization of Deduced Amino Acid Sequences of Arabidopsis PMI1 and PMI2—To date, three classes of PMI have been defined on the basis of sequence similarities (39Proudfoot A.E.I. Turcatti G. Wells T.N.C. Payton M.A. Smith D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The first class (type I) includes all known eukaryotic PMI with a consensus sequence, YXDXNHKPE, in their primary structure (40Coulin F. Magnenat E. Proudfoot A.E.I. Payton M.A. Scully P. Wells T.N.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14139-14144Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).

A search for PMI genes in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Data Base (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih) showed that two PMI genes (PMI1 and -2) exist in A. thaliana. The cDNAs of PMI1 and PMI2 of Arabidopsis contained 432 and 441 amino acid residues, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1). The predicted molecular masses for PMI1 and PMI2 were 48.5 and 49.2 kDa, respectively, which were similar to those of S. cerevisiae PMI40 (48.2 kDa), C. albicans PMI (48.8 kDa), and human PMI (46.6 kDa) (39Proudfoot A.E.I.

The deduced amino acid sequence of PMI1 showed 64, 37, 39, and 41% identity, respectively, to Arabidopsis PMI2 and other PMIs from S. cerevisiae, C. albicans, and humans. On the other hand, the deduced amino acid sequence of PMI2 showed 36, 38, and 40% identity, respectively, to S. cerevisiae, C. albicans, and human PMIs. Arabidopsi"
https://openalex.org/W2133588896,"Astrocytes have been shown to release factors that have promoting or inhibiting effects on neuronal development. However, mechanisms controlling the release of such factors from astrocytes are not well established. Astrocytes express muscarinic receptors whose activation stimulates a robust intracellular signaling, although the role of these receptors in glial cells is not well understood. Acetylcholine and acetylcholine receptors are present in the brain before synaptogenesis occurs and are believed to be involved in neuronal maturation. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether stimulation of muscarinic receptors in astrocytes would modulate neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons. Rat hippocampal neurons, co-cultured with rat cortical astrocytes previously exposed to the cholinergic agonist carbachol, displayed longer neurites. The effect of carbachol in astrocytes was due to the activation of M3 muscarinic receptors. Exposure of astrocytes to carbachol increased the expression of the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and laminin-1 in these cells. This effect was mediated in part by an increase in laminin-1 and fibronectin mRNA levels and in part by the up-regulation of the production and release of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, an inhibitor of the proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix. The inhibition of fibronectin activity strongly reduced the effect of carbachol on the elongation of all the neurites, whereas inhibition of laminin-1 activity reduced the elongation of minor neurites only. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 also induced neurite elongation through a direct effect on neurons. Taken together, these results demonstrate that cholinergic muscarinic stimulation of astrocytes induces the release of permissive factors that accelerate neuronal development."
https://openalex.org/W2064898026,"In prion disease, the abnormal conformer of the cellular prion protein, PrPSc, deposits in fibrillar protein aggregates in brain and other organs. Limited exposure of PrPSc to proteolytic digestion in vitro generates a core fragment of 19–21 kDa, named PrP27–30, which is also found in vivo. Recent evidence indicates that abnormal truncated fragments other than PrP27–30 may form in prion disease either in vivo or in vitro. We characterized a novel protease-resistant PrP fragment migrating 2–3 kDa faster than PrP27–30 in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) brains. The fragment has a size of about 18.5 kDa when associated with PrP27–30 type 1 (21 kDa) and of 17 kDa when associated with type 2 (19 kDa). Molecular mass and epitope mapping showed that the two fragments share the primary N-terminal sequence with PrP27–30 types 1 and 2, respectively, but lack a few amino acids at the very end of C terminus together with the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. The amounts of the 18.5- or 17-kDa fragments and the previously described 13-kDa PrPSc C-terminal fragment relatively to the PrP27–30 signal significantly differed among CJD subtypes. Furthermore, protease digestion of PrPSc or PrP27–30 in partially denaturing conditions generated an additional truncated fragment of about 16 kDa only in typical sporadic CJD (i.e. MM1). These results show that the physicochemical heterogeneity of PrPSc in CJD extends to abnormal truncated forms of the protein. The findings support the notion of distinct structural “conformers” of PrPSc and indicate that the characterization of truncated PrPSc forms may further improve molecular typing in CJD.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5087) Google Scholar). Most prion diseases are infectious. In the disease, the cellular form of PrP, PrPC, is thought to be converted into abnormal PrP, PrPSc, through a posttranslational event associated with an increase in β-sheet secondary structure and a greater aggregation of the protein (1Prusiner S.B.

As a result, PrPSc becomes insoluble in nondenaturing detergent and, to large extent, a partial protease resistance, a distinctive property commonly used to distinguish PrPSc from PrPC. Incubation of a TSE-infected brain homogenate with proteinase K (PK) under conditions leading to a complete degradation of PrPC generates an N-terminal truncated form of PrPSc, commonly referred to as PrP27–30 (1Prusiner S.B.

Most significantly, PrPSc molecules derived from different strains or disease variants with distinct pathology vary in their N-terminal site of PK cleavage. Based on differences in gel mobility and N-terminal sequence of the core fragments (i.e. PrP27–30) generated by PK digestion, Parchi et al. (19Parchi P. Castellani R. Capellari S. Ghetti B. Young K.

The two PrPSc types in conjunction with the codon 129 genotype largely explained CJD phenotypic variability and for the first time provided a molecular basis for disease classification (i.e. MM1, MM2, VV1, etc.) (27Parchi P. Giese A. Capellari S. Brown P. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Windl O. Zerr I. Budka H. Kopp N. Piccardo P. Poser S. Rojiani A. Streichemberger N. Julien J. Vital C. Ghetti B. Gambetti P. Kretzschmar H. Ann.

More recently, the study of PrPSc under stringent pH conditions using a gel electrophoresis technique with increased resolution demonstrated that PrPSc types 1 and 2 are heterogeneous species, which can be further distinguished into six molecular subtypes that better fit the current histopathologic classification of sporadic CJD (sCJD) (28Notari S.

Unglycosylated PrPSc fragments of 7–8 kDa, truncated at both the N termini and the C termini, were first associated with Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease (29Tagliavini F. Prelli F. Ghiso J.

Neurol. 1998; 57: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), whereas either a 16-kDa or a 7-kDa C-terminal fragment was detected in scrapie-infected hamsters (24Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Bessen R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32230-32235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 32Kocisko D.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Caughey B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13434-13442Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). More recently, two novel C-terminal fragments of PrPSc (PrP-CTF) have been characterized in sCJD (33Zou W.Q. Capellari S. Parchi P. Sy M.S. Gambetti P. Chen S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40429-40436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These PrPSc fragments have a relative molecular mass of about 12 and 13 kDa (PrP-CTF 12/13), include glycosylated and unglycosylated forms and an intact C terminus, and originate from PrPSc cleavage at residues 162/167 and 154/156, respectively. In one study, the relative amount of PrP-CTF 12/13, although varying considerably from case to case, accounted for between 0 and 25% of the whole PrPSc signal and showed no apparent correlation with the disease subtype (33Zou W.Q.

Muramoto T. Tanaka T. Kitamoto N. Ironside J.W. Nagashima K. Yamada M. Sato T. Mohri S. Kitamoto T. J. Gen.

Two additional putative N-terminally truncated PrPSc fragments, possibly correlating with pathological features of the disease, include a 16–17-kDA unglycosylated fragment found in all PrPSc type 1 sCJD cases and the MM2C sCJD subtype and a fully glycosylated PrP fragment of about 17.5–18 kDa, linked to the sCJD subtypes VV2 and MV2 (35Zanusso G. Farinazzo A. Prelli F. Fiorini M. Gelati M. Ferrari S. Righetti P.G. Rizzuto N. Frangione B. Monaco S. J. Biol.

Lastly, a similar truncated fragment of about 17 kDa was recently detected in sporadic CJDMM2 and variant CJD (vCJD) by another group (36Pan T. Li R. Kang S.C. Pastore M. Wong B.S. Ironside J. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).To better characterize these fragments and the novel putative PrP abnormal fragments, we analyzed PrPSc by Western blotting and a panel of antibodies against various PrP epitopes in 40 CJD cases, including all sCJD subtypes and vCJD. We found that abnormal PrP aggregates in CJD include previously undetected PrPSc fragments sharing the primary N-terminal sequence with types 1 and 2 but lacking the very end of the C terminus together with the GPI anchor. Furthermore, we disclosed previously unreported differences in the amount of PrP-CTF 12/13 among CJD subtypes and describe a novel fragment specific to sCJDMM1 generated by PK digestion in partially denaturing conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPatients and TissuesWe studied 40 sCJD cases and 4 vCJD cases phenotypically characterized in regard to clinical and histopathological features, pattern of PrP deposition, PRNP genotype, and Western blot profile of PrPSc. Sporadic CJD subtypes were classified according to Parchi et al. (27Parchi P. Giese A. Capellari S. Brown P. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Windl O. Zerr I. Budka H. Kopp N. Piccardo P. Poser S. Rojiani A.

Clinical data and relevant medical records were also examined. The sCJD cases included 9 MM1, 4 MV1, 4 VV1, 5 MV2 with kuru plaques, 10 VV2, 3 MM2-cortical (MM2-C), and 5 MM2-thalamic (MM2-T), also known as sporadic fatal insomnia. All the selected cases showed a single PrPSc type in their brain according to the method by Notari et al. (37Notari S. Capellari S. Langeveld J. Giese A. Strammiello R. Gambetti P. Kretzschmar H.A.

Autopsy brain tissues from three subjects free of neurological symptoms and signs and with a negative neuropathologic examination were used as negative controls. Brain tissues were obtained at autopsy and were kept frozen at –80 °C until use. Brain samples used were from the frontal cerebral cortex, striatum, thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellum. In addition, two white matter samples from the frontal lobe and the cerebellum were obtained from three cases of each sCJD group.

In addition, two rabbit antiserums against either PrP N terminus (residues 23–40) or PrP C terminus (the 2301 antiserum, residues 220–231) were used.Molecular GeneticsGenomic DNA was extracted from blood or frozen brain tissue. Genotyping of the PRNP coding region was performed as described (19Parchi P. Castellani R. Capellari S. Ghetti B. Young K. Chen S.G. Farlow M. Dickson D.W. Sima A.A.F. Trojanowski J.Q. Petersen R.B.

Bendheim P.E. Marmorstein A.D. Potempska A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), as modified (42Zou W.Q. Colucci M. Gambetti P. Chen S.G.

Rogers M. Stahl N. Telling G. Prusiner S.B. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).Sample Preparation and Western BlottingBrain homogenates (10%, w/v) were prepared on ice in lysis buffer with high buffer capacity (LB 100) (100 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), pH 6.9. Because the pH of Tris buffers changes significantly according to the buffer temperature, the lysis buffers were titrated to pH 6.9 at 37 °C (i.e. the temperature at which protease digestion is performed). Total protein concentration was estimated using a standard colorimetric method based on bicinchoninic acid (Pierce Biotechnology). All samples were diluted to 6 mg of protein/ml before protease digestion. Aliquots were treated for 1 h at 37 °C with PK (Roche Diagnostics, specific activity by certificate of analysis: 47.9 units/mg) at the concentration of 2 units/ml (1 unit corresponds to 50 μg/ml when PK specific activity is 20 units/mg). Protease digestion was terminated by the addition of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Samples were diluted in sample buffer (final concentration: 3% SDS, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8) and boiled for 8 min before loading.Protein samples (brain tissue equivalent to 0.2–1 mg of wet tissue) were separated in 13 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (37.5:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) using gel electrophoresis apparatus holding 7-cm running gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore) for 2 h at 60 V, blocked with 10% nonfat milk in Tween 20-Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, and probed with the appropriate antibody. The immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL standard or plus, GE Healthcare) on Kodak BioMax Light films (Eastman Kodak Co.).PK Digestion in Partial Protein Denaturing ConditionsTemperature—Aliquots of brain homogenate (10%) in LB 100, pH 6.9, were treated at different temperatures (37, 50, 60, 70, 80 °C) with 10 units/ml PK for 1 h. Protease digestion was terminated by the addition of 2 mm PMSF. Then samples were resuspended in sample buffer (see above) and boiled for 8 min before loading.SDS Plus Temperature (“PMSF–” Condition)—Brain homogenates (10%) in LB 100, pH 6.9, were treated at 37 °C with 10 units/ml PK for 1 h. Protease digestion was not terminated by the addition of 2 mm PMSF. The samples were resuspended in a β-mercaptoethanol-free sample buffer (final concentration: 3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8) and boiled for 8 min. β-mercaptoethanol was added at the final concentration of 4% just before loading.GdnHCl—Aliquots of 50 μl from 10% brain homogenate in phosphate-buffered saline were mixed with 50 μl of GdnHCl stock solutions, with final GdnHCl 1 m. The solution was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 10 units/ml PK. The reaction was stopped with 2 mm PMSF. Proteins were precipitated with 8 volumes of methanol for 2 h at –20 °C. Samples were then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were resuspended in sample buffer (see above) and boiled for 8 min before loading.RESULTSAnalysis of Truncated PrPSc Forms in CJD, Evidence for Two Novel Fragments—To detect and characterize the full spectrum of truncated PrPSc fragments in CJD, we performed immunoblots on total brain homogenates using a panel of antibodies recognizing different PrP epitopes. In addition to known abnormal PrP truncated species such as PrP27–30 type 1 and PrP-CTF 12/13, the analyses of samples from sCJDMM1, the most common CJD subtype, showed a novel PK-resistant PrP truncated form with an apparent relative molecular mass of 18.5 kDa (Fig. 1A). The fragment was detected by all antibodies tested with epitopes located between PrP residues 89 and 221 (Fig. 1A) except 6H4 (data not shown), which likely recognize a conformational epitope that is not accessible in this fragment. By contrast, the fragment was not seen by antibodies raised against the PrP N terminus (residues 1–70, data not shown) and virtually undetected by the 2301 antiserum, which recognizes an epitope located at the very end (residues 220–231) of the C-terminal moiety (Fig. 1A).The analyses of other sCJD subtypes and vCJD revealed that the 18.5-kDa fragment was only detectable in the MM1/MV1 subtype (Fig. 1B), but a similar faster migrating 17-kDa band was seen in all subtypes associated with PrPSc type 2. The 17-kDa fragment, like the 18.5-kDa band linked to the MM1/MV1 subtype, was readily detected by antibodies with epitopes scattered along PrP residues 99–221 but undetected by the 2301 antiserum (data not shown). At variance with the 18.5-kDa peptide, however, the 17-kDa band was not recognized by 12B2 (Fig. 1C), a monoclonal antibody raised against an epitope (residues 89–93) located between PrPSc types 1 and 2 primary cleavage sites. These results indicate that the 18.5- and 17-kDa fragments have different N-terminal ends, matching those of the PrP27–30 type to which they are associated. In addition, they likely share the C-terminal portion and lack the GPI anchor. To further prove that these fragments lack the GPI anchor, we analyzed in parallel samples treated or not with aqueous hydrofluoric acid, which removes the GPI modification (43Borchelt D.R. Rogers M. Stahl N. Telling G. Prusiner S.B. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As expected, after the GPI loss, PrPSc types 1 and 2 exactly matched the migration of the 18.5- and 17-kDa fragments, whereas no further truncated forms appeared in the 12–16-kDa range (Fig. 1D and data not shown).The intensity of the 17-kDa fragment varied significantly among the type 2-associated CJD subtypes (Fig. 1, B and E). The 17-kDa band showed the highest amounts in vCJD and the lowest in MM2-T. In addition, as a distinctive feature, the 17-kDa band often resolved as a doublet in vCJD (Fig. 1B).As expected from their predicted amino acid sequences based on antibody mapping, indicating that the fragments include the glycosylation sites, the amount of both the 18.5-kDa fragment and the 17-kDa fragment significantly increased after PNGase F treatment (Fig. 2). In this condition, weak traces of the 18.5-kDa band were also seen in the VV1 samples (Fig. 2), indicating that either one of the two fragments actually forms in all CJD subtypes, although in significantly different amounts.FIGURE 2Effect of deglycosylation on the 18.5- and 17-kDa PrPSc fragments. Immunoblot analyses of frontal cortex homogenates from MM1, MM2C, and VV1 subtypes are shown. PK-treated samples were either untreated or treated with PNGase F and probed with SAF60.

https://openalex.org/W2049518601,"Human CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ (CEBPD) has been reported as a tumor suppressor because it both induces growth arrest involved in differentiation and plays a crucial role as a regulator of pro-apoptotic gene expression. In this study, CEBPD gene expression is down-regulated, and “loss of function” alterations in CEBPD gene expression are observed in cervical cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Suppressor of zeste 12 (SUZ12), a component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), silences CEBPD promoter activity, enhancing the methylation of exogenous CEBPD promoter through the proximal CpG islands. Moreover, this molecular approach is consistent with the opposite mRNA expression pattern between SUZ12 and CEBPD in cervical cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma patients. We further demonstrated that Yin-Yang-1 (YY1) physically interacts with SUZ12 and can act as a mediator to recruit the polycomb group proteins and DNA methyltransferases to participate in the CEBPD gene silencing process. Taking these results into consideration, we not only demonstrate the advantage of SUZ12-silenced CEBPD expression in tumor formation but also clarify an in vivo evidence for YY1-mediated silencing paths of SUZ12 and DNA methyltransferases on the CEBPD promoter.

Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the family members contain a highly conserved basic leucine zipper domain for dimerization and a basic domain for DNA binding at the C terminus. The genes for six C/EBP members have been cloned to date from several species as follows: CEBPA (C/EBP, RcEBP-1), CEBPB (NF-IL6, LAP, CRP2, NF-M), CEBPG (Ig/EBP-1), CEBPD, CEBPE (CRP-1), and CEBPZ (CHOP-10, GADD153) (1Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C/EBP family members recognize similar DNA sequences in their target genes and form homo- or heterodimers with other C/EBPs, as well as with transcription factors of the NF-κB and Fos/Jun families (2Kinoshita S. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that CEBPD participates in controlling adipogenesis and the acute phase response to inflammatory stimuli (3Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7432-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Mouse CEBPD is low in most cell types and tissues; however, it is rapidly induced by stimulators, such as interleukin-6 (4Sanford D.C. DeWille J.W. Prostate. 2005; 63: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), lipopolysaccharide (5Liu Y.W. Tseng H.P. Chen L.C. Chen B.K. Chang W.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), interferon-α, interferon-γ (6Tengku-Muhammad T.S. Hughes T.R. Ranki H. Cryer A. Ramji D.P. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), tumor necrosis factor-α (7Cardinaux J.R. Allaman I. Magistretti P.J. Glia. 2000; 29: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (8Wang J.M. Tseng J.T. Chang W.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3365-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). CEBPD has recently been implicated in cell cycle regulation, its mRNA and protein levels being highly induced in mouse mammary epithelial cells upon serum and growth factor withdrawal (9O'Rourke J.P. Newbound G.C. Hutt J.A. DeWille J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16582-16589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CEBPD inhibits the growth of human prostate cancer and erythroleukemia cells, thus exhibiting decreased cyclin D1, cyclin E, and hyperphosphorylated retinoblastoma protein levels accompanied by an increased p27 expression (10Ikezoe T. Gery S. Yin D. O'Kelly J. Binderup L. Lemp N. Taguchi H. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4762-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 11Gery S. Tanosaki S. Hofmann W.K. Koppel A. Koeffler H.P. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1589-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). CEBPD is also involved in regulating the pro-apoptotic gene expression during mammary gland involution (12Thangaraju M. Rudelius M. Bierie B. Raffeld M. Sharan S. Hennighausen L. Huang A.M. Sterneck E. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 4675-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the phenomena of genomic instability and centrosome amplifications are found in Cebpd-depleted primary embryonic fibroblasts (13Huang A.M. Montagna C. Sharan S. Ni Y. Ried T. Sterneck E. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1549-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results suggest that CEBPD plays an important role in inducing growth arrest and could serve as a tumor suppressor. Recent reports reveal alterations in structure or expression levels of C/EBP family members in a variety of human cancers. For example, down-regulation of tumor suppressor CEBPA is seen in several human malignancies, including acute myelogenous leukemia and lung cancer through epigenetic modulation (14Tada Y. Brena R.M. Hackanson B. Morrison C. Otterson G.A. Plass C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2006; 98: 396-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). CEBPB is overexpressed in carcinogen-induced skin tumorigenesis (15Zhu S. Yoon K. Sterneck E. Johnson P.F. Smart R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and breast cancer (16Grimm S.L. Rosen J.M. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2003; 8: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover, the “loss of function” alterations of CEBPD and the promoter methylation of the CEBPD gene have been observed in primary human breast tumors (17Sivko G.S. DeWille J.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 830-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Tang D. Sivko G.S. DeWille J.W. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2006; 95: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the silencing mechanism of the CEBPD gene is unknown in tumorigenesis. Hypermethylation of CpG islands, an epigenetic event that is not accompanied by changes in DNA sequence, represents an alternative mechanism different from deletions or mutations to inactivate tumor suppressor genes. Recent evidence supports the notion that CpG island hypermethylation, via the silencing of key cancer-related genes, plays a major causal role in cancer (19Lund A.H. van Lohuizen M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2315-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 20Sparmann A. van Lohuizen M. Nat. Rev. 2006; 6: 846-856Crossref Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). PcG proteins are epigenetic chromatin modifiers involved in cancer development and also in the maintenance of embryonic and adult stem cells. These regulators, first discovered in Drosophila, repress the homeotic genes controlling segment identity in the developing embryo (21Bird A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5254) Google Scholar). The PcG proteins form multiple PRCs, the components of which are conserved from Drosophila to humans (22Lund A.H. van Lohuizen M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The PRCs are recruited to repress the transcriptional initiation sites and the polycomb-responsive element of target genes. Thus, these PRCs act through epigenetic modification of the chromatin structure to promote gene silencing (23Ringrose L. Paro R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 413-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). To date, five PRCs have been discovered, including PhoRC, PRC1, PRC2, PRC3, and PRC4. PRC2 and its related complexes, PRC3 and PRC4, contain three core components as follows: EZH2, SUZ12, and EED (23Ringrose L. Paro R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 413-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). PRC2 catalyzes trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27), and this enzymatic activity is required for PRC2-mediated gene silencing. H3K27 methylation is thought to provide a binding surface for PRC1, which facilitates oligomerization, condensation of chromatin structure, and inhibition of nucleosome remodeling to maintain silencing (24Cao R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Science. 2002; 298: 1039-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (2748) Google Scholar, 25Kirmizis A. Bartley S.M. Kuzmichev A. Margueron R. Reinberg D. Green R. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1592-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) has been reported as a H3K27 methyltransferase, and SUZ12 is essential for EZH2 histone methyltransferase activity (26Cao R. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 57-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). EZH2 and SUZ12 are downstream target genes of the pRb/E2F pathway and are essential for the proliferation of primary and tumor cells (27Bracken A.P. Pasini D. Capra M. Prosperini E. Colli E. Helin K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5323-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 28Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Moreover, EZH2 and SUZ12 are highly expressed in numerous human tumors. SUZ12 is also up-regulated by TCF4/β-catenin complexes and plays an important role in tumorigenesis of the colon (29Kirmizis A. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 113-121PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that SUZ12 bound to CpG islands of the CEBPD 5′-flanking region to repress CEBPD transcription through coordination of two methylation paths, H3K27 trimethylation and DNA methylation. Consistent with our molecular approach, the opposite expression pattern of CEBPD silencing and SUZ12 overexpression was observed in human tumor samples of cervical cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SUZ12 functions as a mediator involved in the interaction of YY1 and the recruitment of DNMTs on the CEBPD promoter. In view of this, it is here suggested that the epigenetic silencing effect of overexpressed SUZ12 can be recruited by YY1 to attenuate CEBPD transcription in tumorigenesis. This study demonstrates the molecular mechanism of CEBPD silencing and further provides a target for tumor therapy. Materials—Human EGF was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ).

The expression plasmid of YY1 was a gift from Dr. Pan-Chyr Yang (College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taiwan). Cell Culture and Treatments—Human epidermoid carcinoma cell line, A431, and cervical epithelioid carcinoma cell line, HeLa, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells grew to 80% confluence in complete media and were then switched to serum- or mitogen-free media for 24 h. Human EGF (50 ng/ml), PMA (10 nm), or 5-azaC (10 μm) were subsequently added to cells for the designated times. Tissue Samples—Eleven patients with cervical cancer and 12 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were surgically resected at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital and the National Taiwan University Hospital, respectively. Total RNA samples were extracted from tumor tissues and adjacent unaffected cervical or liver tissues. All tumor specimens from patients were obtained from surgically resected tissues that had previously been pathologically assessed at both the National Cheng Kung University Hospital and the National Taiwan University Hospital. The fresh tissue samples were immediately cut into small pieces, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in a deep freezer. Total RNA was extracted from the tumorous and paired non-tumorous tissue using the TRIzol reagent. The staging system of hepatocellular carcinoma was based upon previous reports (30Peng S.Y. Chen W.J. Lai P.L. Jeng Y.M. Sheu J.C. Hsu H.C. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 112: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 31Jeng Y.M. Peng S.Y. Lin C.Y. Hsu H.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Total proteins were homogenized in the lysis buffer (20 mm MOPS, 2% SDS, 20 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg aprotinin/ml, 1 μg leupeptin/ml, 1 mm Na3VO4) using a tissue grinder, and 20 μg of total proteins were analyzed by Western blot. Plasmid Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—Cells were re-plated 24 h before transfection at an optimal density in 2 ml of fresh culture medium in a 6-well plastic dish. They were then transfected with plasmids by Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total amount of DNA for each experiment was matched with the empty vector. The Opti-MEM media were changed to conditional medium, with or without stimulators after 6 h, and incubated for 15 h. The luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured by the luciferase assay system as per the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the TRIzol RNA extraction reagent. Three μg of the isolated RNA was subjected to reverse transcription with SuperScript™ III. Briefly, 1 μl of reverse transcription product, 1 unit of Super-Therm polymerase, 1× Super-Therm buffer, and 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP were mixed with primer pairs for SUZ12, CEBPD, GAPDH, or S26 in a total volume of 25 μl. PCR was performed in a temperature-gradient thermocycler (ASTEC), initially heated to 94 °C for 2 min, followed by the Touch Down PCR program, 22 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing for 1 min (the annealing temperature is reduced by 1 °C per 2 cycles from 65 to 55 °C), 72 °C for 1 min, and a final 72 °C for 10 min. Specific primers used for SUZ12 are as follows: 5′-CTTACATGTCTCATCGAAACTCC-3′ and 5′-GGCTGGAAGCTCTTCATTGACA-3′; for human CEBPD, 5′-AGCGCAACAACATCGCCGTG-3′ and 5′-GTCGGGTCTGAGGTATGGGTC-3′; for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 5′-CCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3′; for S26, 5′-CCGTGCCTCCAAGATGACAAAG-3′ and 5′-GTTCGGTCCTTGCGGGCTTCAC-3′ were used for the RT-PCR analysis. PCR was halted at the exponential phase of the amplified genes, 30 cycles for SUZ12, 28 cycles for CEBPD, 23 cycles for GAPDH, and 22 cycles for S26. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel and made visible with ethidium bromide staining. The intensity of the PCR fragment photographed was determined with the IS-1000 digital imaging system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). The SUZ12 and CEBPD mRNA levels were determined by the ratio of signal intensity of SUZ12 or CEBPD to that of GAPDH or S26 measured by One-dimensional Image Analysis software (Eastman Kodak Co.) and scored as high (ratio >1.0) or low (ratio <1.0). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in the modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg of aprotinin/ml, 1 μg of leupeptin/ml, and 1 mm Na3VO4) to be analyzed. Following lysis, the lysates were resolved on an SDS containing 10% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride nylon membrane, and probed with specific antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The specific bands were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody and revealed by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blot system (Pierce). siRNA Assay—The CEBPD knockdown was carried out as described by Wang et al. (32Wang J.M. Ko C.Y. Chen L.C. Wang W.L. Chang W.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Two knockdowns of SUZ12 oligonucleotides (25Kirmizis A. Bartley S.M. Kuzmichev A. Margueron R. Reinberg D. Green R. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1592-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), SUZ12 si1 and SUZ12 si2, were synthesized according to the oligonucleotide design procedure manual (Ambion). It was as follows: 5′-GATCCGCCCGGAAATTTCCCGTCCCTTCAAGAGAGGGACGGGAAATTTCCGGGTTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and 5′-GATCCGAGATGACCTGCATTGCCCTTCAAGAGAGGGCAATGCAGGTCATCTCTTTTTTGGAAA-3′. The 5′- and 3′-ends of the oligonucleotide are noncomplementary and formed the BamHI and HindIII restriction site overhangs that facilitated efficient directional cloning into the pSilencer™ 3.1-H1 neo vector. Cells were transfected separately with SUZ12 siRNA expression vectors or pSilencer™ 3.1 negative control vectors (siC) that encode a hairpin siRNA whose sequence was not found in the human genome data bases. After 24 h, transfectants were lysed to harvest total RNA or protein, and we performed RT-PCR or Western blot. Sodium Bisulfite Modification of Genomic DNA/Methylation-specific PCR—Genomic DNA was isolated from cell lines, cervical cancer, or HCC samples using a DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). It was treated with sodium bisulfite, purified, and eluted in distilled water. The primers for the first PCR were as follows: forward primer, 5′-AAGAAGAAGGTTTTGGAGTGTTGGTAGAGG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-AAACGAAACTATCACCTCGCTAAACCCAACCC-3′. Initial PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 3 min; 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 42 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min; subsequently followed by 6 min at 72 °C and cooled down to 4 °C. Following the first amplification, an aliquot of the initial PCR products was used as a template DNA for the nested PCR. The primers for the nested PCR were as follows: forward primer, 5′-TGGAGTGTTGGTAGAGGGAGTGTT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TTCTAACCCCGACTAACGTACACG-3′. Nested PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 3 min; 36 cycles held at a temperature of 94 °C for 30 s, followed by 42 °C for 30 s and then 72 °C for 40 s; subsequently maintained at 72 °C for 6 min and then finally cooled down to 4 °C. The nested PCR products were subcloned into yT&A cloning vector (Yeastern Biotech Co., Taiwan) and sequenced with M13 forward and/or reverse primers by the Genomics BioSci&Tech. Co. For each sample, three separate clones were sequenced. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and re-ChIP Assay— The ChIP assay was carried out essentially as described by Wang et al. (8Wang J.M. Tseng J.T. Chang W.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3365-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. The cross-linked chromatin was then prepared and sonicated to an average size of 300–500 bp. Equal 200 μg of cross-linked protein/DNA lysates were divided and incubated with 5 μg of specific antibodies or control rabbit IgG for each immunoprecipitation at 4 °C overnight. After cross-linking reversal, the immunoprecipitated chromatin was amplified by primers related to specific regions of the CEBPD genomic locus. Twenty μg of cross-linked samples were reversed for equal input control. The primers were as follows: -1575(sense), 5′-GAGGCCGGCGAATCTCTTAAGCCCAGG-3′, and -1151(antisense), 5′-TTTGAGGCCGGCATTTCTGGTCAGACC-3′; -769(sense), 5′-CGTCTCCCCCATCTGCTCTGCTTTTGG-3′, and -447(antisense), 5′-TGGGAGAGGACCCGCGCGTCCAAGGAC-3′; -348(sense), 5′-CGAGGAGGTTCCAAGCCCAC-3′, and +9(antisense), 5′-GGCTGTCACCTCGCTGGGCC-3′. For the re-ChIP assay, the first immune complex, initially washed twice with buffer, incorporated 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm EDTA. The complexes were then further washed three times with low salt buffer, consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1 mm EDTA, and resolved in 10 mm DTT at 37 °C, further diluted in ChIP dilution buffer, and then processed according to the same ChIP assay protocol using the indicated antibodies. Finally, the amplified DNA products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and confirmed by sequencing. The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 3 min; 32 cycles of 94 °C for 40 s, 58 °C for 50 s, 72 °C for 1 min; and subsequently followed by 10 min at 72 °C. The amplified DNA products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and confirmed by sequencing. DNA Affinity Precipitation Assay (DAPA)—The 200 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 μg of biotinylated oligonucleotides with YY1 or mutant YY1 sites of CEBPD promoter in the presence of a DNA binding buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 15 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg of aprotinin/ml, 1 μg of leupeptin/ml, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, 40 μl of streptavidin-magnetic beads was added to the reaction mixture and the incubation continued for 1 h. The complexes were then precipitated by centrifugation and washed three times with DNA binding buffer before they were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequently analyzed by Western blot. Soft Agar Assay—One ml of 0.3% agarose in complete growth medium containing 3000 HeLa cells bearing expression vectors of SUZ12, CEBPD, or CEBPD siRNA were seeded onto 1.5 ml of 0.6% agarose in 6-well plates. After 14–21 days, cells were stained with 0.05% crystal violet and the colonies photographed and scored for statistical analysis. Immunofluorescence Analysis—HeLa cells were grown on sterile glass coverslips for 18–24 h. The coverslips were removed from media and washed with 1× PBS and then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were permeabilized in 2% fetal bovine serum, 0.4% Triton X-100, PBS for 15 min at 25 °C and then incubated for 2 h with SUZ12 (1:200), YY1 (1:50), DNMT1 (1 μg/ml), DNMT3A (2 μg/ml), or DNMT3B (1 μg/ml) antibodies. After three washes in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse or Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200, Invitrogen) for 1 h at 25°C. Cells were thoroughly washed in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS, counter-stained, and mounted on glass slides with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen) for immunofluorescence microscopy analysis. CEBPD Induces Cell Death and Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Transformation—CEBPD has been suggested as a potential tumor suppressor. However, the CEBPD-exerted anticancer role involved in tumorigenesis is not well studied. To investigate the biological function of CEBPD in cancer cells, especially in cervical cancer and HCC, several fundamental approaches, including pro-apoptotic assay, foci assay, and a soft agar assay were performed. Induction of CEBPD by an inducible expression system resulted in sub-G1 accumulation in HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). The overexpression of CEBPD reduced foci formation, but its domain-negative mutant, lacking the transactivation domain of CEBPD, reversed this repressive effect of cell proliferation in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the cell transformation assay demonstrated that CEBPD could inhibit cell transformation, whereas the loss of CEBPD expression enhanced the transformation activity (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that the anticancer roles of CEBPD are involved in the pro-apoptotic regulation and inhibition of cell growth and transformation. DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor Reverses CEBPD Expression—A change in the methylation pattern of CpG islands has been identified in cancer cells and results in the silencing of important tumor suppressor genes. Evidence demonstrates that CEBPD is silenced in breast cancer, but the mechanism has not been characterized (17Sivko G.S. DeWille J.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 830-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Tang D. Sivko G.S. DeWille J.W. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2006; 95: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To identify whether the CEBPD gene locus contains CpG islands, the sequences (including CEBPD promoter and gene) from -1600 to +1000 (Fig. 2A, bottom panel) were analyzed using the EBI website CpGPlot program. The CEBPD gene locus carried a high percentage of C or G nucleotides, and two putative CpG islands were found around -960 to -360 bp and -210 to +880 bp of the input sequence (Fig. 2A). To investigate whether the DNA methylation plays a functional role in CEBPD transcription, two cervical cancer cell lines, including HeLa and A431, were treated with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azaC. The endogenous CEBPD mRNA expression was able to be restored with 5-azaC treatment (Fig. 2B, left panel). This result indicates that DNA methylation plays a role in CEBPD gene silencing. Our previous study demonstrated that the proximal region of the CEBPD promoter is important for its transcriptional activation (8Wang J.M. Tseng J.T. Chang W.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3365-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To verify that DNA methylation occurs within this proximal region of CEBPD promoter in these cells, bisulfite sequencing was performed. There were highly methylated CpG dinucleotides in the CEBPD promoter region between -282 to -51 bp in HeLa and A431 cells. The site-specific methylated CpG dinucleotides decreased after 5-azaC treatment accompanied CEBPD induction (Fig. 2B, right panel). PcG Proteins Bind to CEBPD Promoter in Vivo—Previous studies have shown that PRC complexes play important roles in maintaining the silent state of target genes. Methylation of CpG islands is the most important cause in PcG protein-mediated gene silencing by recruiting DNMTs (33Vire E. Brenner C. Deplus R. Blanchon L. Fraga M. Didelot C. Morey L. Van Eynde A. Bernard D. Vanderwinden J.M. Bollen M. Esteller M. Di Croce L. de Launoit Y. Fuks F. Nature. 2006; 439: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar). Our data revealed that DNA methylation was involved in CEBPD silencing, so we next examined whether the epigenetic modifiers, PcG proteins, participated in the CEBPD gene silencing by means of a ChIP assay. The immunoprecipitated DNA products were amplified by PCR with specific primers corresponding to -1575/-1151, -769/-447, and -348/+9 on the CEBPD gene locus (Fig. 3A, top panel). We have shown that SUZ12 and EZH2 can specifically bind to the -769/-447 and -348/+9 regions of the CEBPD gene locus (Fig. 3A, bottom panel). Because PcG proteins are responsible for the H3K27 trimethylation, we further investigated the methylation regions of H3K27 on the CEBPD promoter. As expected, H3K27 also could be trimethylated in the -769/-447 and -348/+9 regions. Taken together, these results indicate that SUZ12 and EZH2 do indeed bind to the CpG islands of the proximal CEBPD promoter, and this binding activity is coincident with H3K27 trimethylation.

https://openalex.org/W2135923912,"An intracellular mannanase was identified from the thermoacidophile Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius Tc-12-31. This enzyme is particularly interesting, because it shows no significant sequence similarity to any known glycoside hydrolase. Gene cloning, biochemical characterization, and structural studies of this novel mannanase are reported in this paper. The gene consists of 963 bp and encodes a 320-amino acid protein, AaManA. Based on its substrate specificity and product profile, AaManA is classified as an endo-β-1,4-mannanase that is capable of transglycosylation. Kinetic analysis studies revealed that the enzyme required at least five subsites for efficient hydrolysis. The crystal structure at 1.9Å resolution showed that AaManA adopted a (β/α)8-barrel fold. Two catalytic residues were identified: Glu151 at the C terminus of β-stand β4 and Glu231 at the C terminus of β7. Based on the structure of the enzyme and evidence of its transglycosylation activity, AaManA is placed in clan GH-A. Superpositioning of its structure with that of other clan GH-A enzymes revealed that six of the eight GH-A key residues were functionally conserved in AaManA, with the exceptions being residues Thr95 and Cys150. We propose a model of substrate binding in AaManA in which Glu282 interacts with the axial OH-C(2) in–2 subsites.

Mannans are polysaccharides found in plants and consist of a backbone of β-1,4-linked mannose and glucose units. Mannose residues often carry an α-galactosyl substitute at O-6, and the degree of substitution depends on the plant of origin (Fig. 1A) (1Timell T.E. Wood Sci. Tech. 1967; 1: 45-70Crossref Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Mannans are widely distributed in nature in parts of the hemicellulose fraction in hardwoods and softwoods (1Timell T.E. Wood Sci. Tech. 1967; 1: 45-70Crossref Scopus (731) Google Scholar), legume seeds (2Srivastava M. Kapoor V.P. Chem.

Res. 2001; 330: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Endo-β-1,4-mannanases (mannanases; EC 3.2.1.78) are glycoside hydrolases that randomly cleave the β-1,4-linkage in mannans (Fig. 1, A and B) (4Dekker R.F. Richards G.N. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1976; 32: 277-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar); these enzymes have been isolated from bacteria, fungi, plants, and some mollusks (5Ma Y. Xue Y. Dou Y. Xu Z. Tao W. Zhou P.

Interest in these enzymes has been increasing due to their importance in hemicellulose hydrolysis and various other applications (5Ma Y. Xue Y. Dou Y. Xu Z. Tao W. Zhou P. Extremophiles. 2004; 8: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 9Wu G. Bryant M.M. Voitle R.A. Roland Sr., D.A. Poult.

During the last 2 decades, more than 80 sequences of the catalytic domains of mannanase have been reported (see the CAZy site on the World Wide Web) and classified into glycoside hydrolase (GH) 2The abbreviations used are: GH, glycoside hydrolase; ORF, open reading frame; aa, amino acid(s); M1, mannose; M2, mannobiose; M3, mannotriose; M4, mannotetraose; M5, mannopentose; M6, mannohexose; d.p., degree of polymerization. families 5 and 26, based on their sequence similarities (11Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2651) Google Scholar). In recent years, crystallographic resolution of the structures of these enzymes has yielded information on their structure. At present, the tertiary structures of seven mannanases have been determined, of which five are from GH family 5 (12Akita M. Takeda N. Hirasawa K. Sakai H. Kawamoto M. Yamamoto M. Grant W. Hatada Y.

All of these mannanases share a common (β/α)8 barrel fold, a retaining reaction mechanism (Fig. 1C), and two conserved catalytic residues (two glutamate residues at the C termini of β4 and β7, respectively). Therefore, all of these enzymes have been assigned to the same GH clan (i.e. GH-A) (19Henrissat B. Callebaut I. Fabrega S. Lehn P. Mornon J.P. Davies G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Mannanases of microbial origin are usually secreted extracellularly, but so far, only the mannanases from Sporocytophaga myxococcoides and Aerobacter mannolyticus are reported to be intracellular (4Dekker R.F. Richards G.N. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1976; 32: 277-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 20Dhawan S. Kaur J. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 2007; 27: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). However, there is a lack of sequence and structural information for both of these intracellular enzymes; therefore, knowledge of these is very limited. Extremophilic mannanases have obvious advantages in industrial applications (21Niehaus F. Bertoldo C. Kähler M. Antranikian G. Appl. Microbiol.

However, no report has been seen to isolate the mannanase gene from thermoacidophilic bacteria, probably due to the dearth of mannanase-producing strains. In this study, a mannanase-producing thermoacidophilic Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius Tc-12-31 was isolated from an acidic hot spring in Yunnan province, China. The mannanase from A. acidocaldarius Tc-12-31 is an intracellular enzyme that shows no significant sequence similarity to any of the mannanases hitherto characterized. In this paper, we present details pertaining to gene cloning, biochemical characterization, and crystal structure resolution of this novel mannanase. Substrates and Chemicals—Manno-oligosaccharides (mannobiose, mannotriose, mannotetraose, mannopentose, and mannohexose), ivory nut mannan, yeast mannan, pectic potato galactan, and potato galactan were purchased from Megazyme (Wicklow, Ireland). Other substrates were obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—Strain Tc-12-31 was used to clone the mannanase gene and was obtained as follows. Selective agar plates (pH 4), containing basal salts, 0.5% konjac glucomannan, and 1.5% agar (w/v), were prepared as described elsewhere (26Schwermann B. Pfau K. Liliensiek B. Schleyer M. Fischer T. Bakker E.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mud and water samples from an acidic hot spring in Tengchong (Yunnan province, China) were spread on the selective agar plates at 100 μl/plate; this was followed by incubation for 48 h at 60 °C. The colonies thus obtained were replicated on selective agar plates and cultured. Mannanase-producing colonies were detected by flooding the plates with 0.1% (w/v) Congo Red solution (26Schwermann B. Pfau K. Liliensiek B. Schleyer M. Fischer T. Bakker E.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Teather R.M. Wood P.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1982; 43: 777-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain Tc-12-31, which gave the largest clear lysis zone, was selected. Phylogenetic analyses showed that strain Tc-12-31 belongs to the genus Alicyclobacillus, with the sequence of the 16 S rRNA gene exhibiting the highest (99.5%) identity to that of A. acidocaldarius MIH 321 (GenBank™ accession number AB060166). Then the strain was designated A. acidocaldarius Tc-12-31. To prepare genomic DNA, A. acidocaldarius Tc-12-31 was grown under the conditions described elsewhere (26Schwermann B. Pfau K. Liliensiek B. Schleyer M. Fischer T. Bakker E.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but the medium was devoid of glycerol and soluble starch. Escherichia coli DH5α (Invitrogen), E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen), and pUC18 (TaKaRa) and pET28a (Novagen) plasmids were used. The E. coli strains were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium, and 100 μgml–1 ampicillin or 50 μgml–1 kanamycin was added to select plasmid transformants. DNA Library Construction and Positive Clone Screening—Standard molecular methods were used for DNA isolation, genomic library construction, and restriction analyses (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Mannanase-positive clones were identified on replica plates with 0.5% konjac glucanmannan using the substrate overlay method (27Teather R.M. Wood P.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1982; 43: 777-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Fractionation, PAGE, and Zymogram—Cell fractionations of A. acidocaldarius Tc-12-31 were performed as described by Matzke et al. (29Matzke J. Herrmann A. Schneider E. Bakker E.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 183: 55-61Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Laemmli gels (10%) (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) were prepared in the presence of 0.2% konjac glucanmannan. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed once with buffer A (50 mm phosphate sodium citrate, pH 5.5) and incubated for 20 min at 60 °C in the same buffer. The remaining konjac glucanmannan in the gel was visualized by incubating the gel in 0.1% Congo Red solution. The mannanase activity was detected in situ by the formation of a clear lysis band on the gel. Sequence and Structural Analysis—Open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted using an ORF finder on the NCBI Web site, and homologues of these ORFs were searched in the GenBank™ data base using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) (31Altschul S.F.

Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). Sequences were aligned with ClustalX (34Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F.

Bryant S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D192-D196Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar) were searched online for family and domain information. Fold recognition analysis was carried out using the BioInfoBank metaserver and its associated 3D-jury consensus method (37Ginalski K. Elofsson A. Fischer D. Rychlewski L. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1015-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Structure neighbors were searched against the Protein Data Bank using the secondary structure matching service (38Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional molecular visualization and figure preparation were performed with PyMOL (39DeLano W.L. PyMOL. DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar). Enzymatic Assays—The AamanA gene was inserted into plasmid pET28a to produce the expression plasmid pETManA (40Zhang Y. Gao F. Xue Y. Zeng Y. Peng H. Qi J. Ma Y. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2008; 64: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Translation from the resulting ORF resulted in a recombinant protein with a 23-aa peptide (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMAS) fused to Met1 of the AamanA gene product. The recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified for further characterization. The effects of temperature, pH, ions, EDTA, and SDS on AaManA activity were studied as described in the supplemental materials. In subsequent enzymatic assays, pH and temperature optima of 5.5 and 65 °C, respectively, were used (see Fig. S1). Specific activities on konjac glucomannan, locust bean gum, guar gum, and ivory nut mannan were determined. The substrate concentration was 0.5% (w/v) in buffer A, and incubation was carried out at 65 °C for 10 min with 0.05, 0.1, 5, or 10 μm enzyme. Bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg ml–1) was added to all of the incubation reactions. Enzymatic activity was quantified by measuring the release of reducing sugars, as described earlier (41Akino T. Nakamura N. Horikoshi K. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1987; 26: 323-327Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 μmol of mannose-reducing sugar equivalents/min. To screen for other endoglycanase activity, 1 μg of enzyme (in a volume of 5 μl) was spotted onto a 1.2% (w/v) agar plate containing 0.5% (w/v) of the appropriate polysaccharides in buffer A. The plates were incubated at 60 °C for 180 min, and the enzyme activity, which was detected after flooding with 0.1% Congo Red solution, manifested as a clear halo surrounding the “enzyme spot.” To detect the exoglycosidase activity, the p-nitrophenylglycoside substrate (5 mm) was incubated with 1 μm enzyme for 30 min. The release of p-nitrophenol was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. Kinetic Analysis—The Michaelis-Menten constants of the hydrolysis of locust bean gum were determined by using 0.1 μm enzyme and varying concentrations of the substrate (from 0.3 to 5 mg ml–1). The kinetic parameters of manno-oligosaccharide hydrolysis were determined using different substrates: 0.25–6 mm mannotetraose (M4), 0.125–3 mm mannopentose (M5), and 0.125–3 mm mannohexose (M6). The enzyme concentrations used for M4, M5, and M6 were 0.6, 0.3, and 0.2 μm, respectively. All hydrolysis experiments were performed in buffer A to which bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg ml–1) was added. The hydrolysis products were detected using high pH anion exchange chromatography-pulsed amperometric detection, as described earlier (15Larsson A.M. Anderson L. Xu B. Munoz I.G. Uson I. Janson J.-C. Stalbrand H. Stahlberg J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 1500-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Manno-oligosaccharides in the concentration range of 0.5–100 μm were used as standards. Km and kcat were determined by nonlinear regression using the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (available on the World Wide Web). Time Course of Hydrolysis—The time course of hydrolysis was established using 10 μm enzyme in buffer A with 2% (w/v) substrate supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 60 °C. At 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 180 min, 10-μl aliquots were taken out and boiled for 2 min to stop enzymatic hydrolysis. The hydrolysates were measured by TLC (42Cote N. Fleury A. Dumont-Blanchette E. Fukamizo T. Mitsutomi M. Brzezinski R. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Phasing, Model Building, and Structure Determination—Crystallization and data collection of AaManA and its selenomethionyl derivative have been described elsewhere (40Zhang Y. Gao F. Xue Y. Zeng Y.

D. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) was used to determine and refine the positions of the selenium atoms. The RESOLVE program (43Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) was then used to perform solvent flattening and initial phase calculations. Automatic model building was performed with the ARP/wARP program (44Evrard G.X. Langer G.G. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2007; 63: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Subsequent manual rebuilding and refinement cycles were carried out with COOT (45Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Open table in a new tab Site-directed Mutagenesis—The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce amino acid substitutions. The pETManA expression plasmid was used as the mutation template. After confirmation of the desired mutation by DNA sequencing, the mutant AaManA enzymes were expressed and purified by the same procedure as that used for the wild-type enzyme. The global structural integrity of the mutant enzyme was evaluated by CD spectroscopy (48Charnock S.J. Lakey J.H. Virden R. Hughes N. Sinnott M.L. Hazlewood G.P. Pickersgill R. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2942-2951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Characterization of the Gene Cluster Containing AamanA—The genomic library of A. acidocaldarius Tc-12-31 was constructed and screened for clones exhibiting mannanase activity on plates. One positive clone was found in ∼10,000 transformants analyzed. The plasmid (pUCM1) purified from this clone contained a 4180-bp insert. Five ORFs were found along its entire length; these are referred to as glo (459 bp), AamanA (963 bp), pitA (984 bp), ptr (486 bp), and unk (1536 bp), as shown in Fig. 2A. Data base searches using BLAST revealed that none of the genes in the pUCM1 insert showed any similarity to the established mannanases. AamanA was the only gene that encoded a protein that was similar to glycoside hydrolases. The highly sensitive iterative PSI-BLAST search (e value threshold was 0.01) was conducted with AaManA and led to the identification of two galactanases of the GH53 family (i.e. EAN09439 from Enterococcus faecium (EfaGAL) and EAN12989 from Frankia sp. (FraGAL)) (see Fig. S2), after two iterations. Both galactanases exhibited 17% sequence identity with AaManA. This similarity to glycoside hydrolase suggested that AamanA was the gene that encoded the mannanase in pUCM1. This was verified by expression of the AamanA gene in E. coli (see below). AaManA Is an Intracellular Mannanase—Upstream sequence analysis showed that the first ATG codon of AamanA was preceded (9–15 bp) by a typical bacterial ribosome-binding sequence and a–35 promoter region (Fig. 2C). The 320-aa protein encoded by AamanA had no signal peptide, suggesting that the AaManA protein was an intracellular enzyme. This was proved by examining the zymogram corresponding to that of the subclone E. coli DH5α/pUCM1 in different cell fractions of A. acidocaldarius Tc-12-31 (Fig. 2B). The mannanase activity was only observed in the fraction of cellular soluble proteins (Fig. 2B, lane Aa-SP), not in the fractions of the culture fluid (Fig. 2B, lane Aa-CF), cell debris, and membrane proteins (Fig. 2B, lane Aa-CD). Therefore, native AaManA was an intracellular enzyme in A. acidocaldarius Tc-12-31. AaManA Hydrolyzes β-1,4-Mannosidic Substrates—Purified AaManA hydrolyzed polysaccharides containing β-1,4-mannosidic linkages (konjac glucomannan, locust bean gum, guar gum, and ivory nut mannan). The highest activity (1056 units mg–1) was observed when unsubstituted konjac glucomannan was used as the substrate. This activity was much higher than that against the galactosyl-substituted locust bean gum (724 units mg–1) (Table 2). An activity of only 79 units mg–1 was observed toward the more highly substituted galactomannan from guar gum. Therefore, enzymatic activity seems to be limited by the galactose side groups, which is the case in most other mannanases, such as those from Bacillus sp. N16-5 and Cellvibrio japonicus (5Ma Y. Xue Y. Dou Y. Xu Z. Tao W. Zhou P. Extremophiles. 2004; 8: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Le Nours J. Anderson L. Stoll D. Stalbrand H. Lo Leggio L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12700-12708Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The very low activity (69 units mg–1) toward ivory nut mannan could be attributed to the limited access to the glycosidic linkages in this crystalline substrate. This low activity would be expected on the basis of the intracellular location of AaManA, which is unlikely to encounter crystalline mannan as a substrate. AaManA did not hydrolyze crystalline cellulose, chitin, pectin, soluble starch, oat spelled xylan, or α-1,6-linked yeast mannan. No activity was found on p-nitrophenyl β- and α-glucosides, β- and α-galactosides, and β- and α-mannosides; the lack of activity in this case suggests that the enzyme was unable to cleave terminal mannosides. Although the closest relatives of AaManA were β-1,4-galactanases, it is interesting to note that the enzyme did not exhibit any activity against pectic galactan and galactan.TABLE 2Special activities of AaManA and its derivatives on mannopolysaccharidesEnzymeSubstrateLocust bean gumKonjac glucomannanGuar gumIvory nut mannanunits mg-1Wild type724.4 ± 20.01055.7 ± 26.279.4 ± 1.269.3 ± 5.0E151A0.091 ± 0.0020.091 ± 0.005NAaNA, no activity was detected.NAE151Q0.847 ± 0.0210.853 ± 0.022NANAE231A0.102 ± 0.0030.099 ± 0.005NANAE231Q0.027 ± 0.0010.034 ± 0.001NANAC150A310.3 ± 14.3364.7 ± 2.823.9 ± 0.6925 ± 0.68a NA, no activity was detected. Open table in a new tab AaManA Is an Endo-β-1,4-mannanase with Transglycosylation Activity—The hydrolysis products released from konjac glucomannan and locust bean gum were examined by TLC. The products were mainly oligosaccharides with a higher degree of polymerization (d.p.) than biose (Fig. 3A). The enzyme showed no activity on M2; however, cleaved manno-oligosaccharides with d.p. of >3 and manno-oligosaccharides with d.p. of >2 were the main reaction products (Fig. 3, B–E). These results indicate that AaManA hydrolyzed substrates by endo-type cleavage. In addition, during the hydrolysis of manno-oligosaccharides, products with higher d.p. than the substrates were formed, such as M4, M5, and M6 from mannotriose (M3) (Fig. 3B), M5 and M6 from M4 (Fig. 3C), and M6 from M5 (Fig. 3D). These are obvious signs of transglycosylation. Another piece of evidence of transglycosylation was the formation of unequal amounts of end products. For example, among the products of M3, the amount of mannobiose (M2) was much higher than that of mannose (M1) (Fig. 3B). Intuitively, it is expected that M3 cleavage should result in equal amounts of M1 and M2 or in an excess of M1 if the enzyme can further hydrolyze M2 into M1. Similar product inequalities were also observed during the hydrolysis of M4, M5, and M6. In summary, AaManA is an endo-β-1,4-mannanase that is capable of transglycosylation. Since transglycosylation is restricted to retaining hydrolases (49McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar), hydrolysis by AaManA probably operates via a mechanism in which the stereochemistry is retained at the site of cleavage (Fig. 1C). Enzyme Kinetics of AaManA—The kcat and Km for the hydrolysis of locust bean gum by AaManA are 340 s–1 and 2.4 mg ml–1, respectively. This Km value is similar to that of CfMan26A from Cellulomonas fimi (2.3 mg ml–1) (18Le Nours J. Anderson L. Stoll D. Stalbrand H. Lo Leggio L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12700-12708Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and approximately 4 times lower than that of CjMan26A from C. japonicus (8.5 mg ml–1) (17Hogg D. Woo E.J. Bolam D.N.

An Hsp104-binding peptide selected from solid phase arrays enhanced the refolding of a firefly luciferase-peptide fusion protein. Analysis of peptide binding using tryptophan fluorescence revealed two distinct binding sites, one in each AAA+ module of Hsp104. As a further indication of the relevance of peptide binding to the Hsp104 mechanism, we found that it competes with the binding of a model unfolded protein, reduced carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin. Inactivation of the pore loops in either AAA+ module prevented stable peptide and protein binding. However, when the loop in the first AAA+ was inactivated, stimulation of ATPase turnover in the second AAA+ module of this mutant was abolished. Drawing on these data, we propose a detailed mechanistic model of protein unfolding by Hsp104 in which an initial unstable interaction involving the loop in the first AAA+ module simultaneously promotes penetration of the substrate into the second axial channel binding site and activates ATP turnover in the second AAA+ module.

Hsp104 is a AAA+ protein disaggregase that functions in yeast in the resolubilization and reactivation of thermally denatured and aggregated proteins (1Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S.

Likewise, mutation of the flexible loops of Hsp104 and ClpB results in refolding defects suggesting that all Hsp100s employ a similar unfolding/threading mechanism to process substrates whether they are ultimately degraded or refolded (16Weibezahn J. Tessarz P. Schlieker C. Zahn R. Maglica Z. Lee S. Zentgraf H. Weber-Ban E.U. Dougan D.A. Tsai F.T. Mogk A. Bukau B.

Despite the growing body of knowledge regarding the unfolding and translocation mechanism of Hsp104, the determinants of the initial stage of the unfolding process, substrate recognition and binding, remain unclear. In other Hsp100s, recognition of specific peptide sequences initiates unfolding and translocation. Protein substrates of ClpXP generally contain recognition signals of roughly 10–15 residues that can be located either at the N or C termini (21Flynn J.M. Neher S.B. Kim Y.I. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 671-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The SsrA tag, an 11-amino acid peptide (AANDENYALAA) that is appended to the C terminus of polypeptides by the action of transfer-messenger RNA on stalled ribosomes (22Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), is a particularly well studied example of an Hsp100-targeting peptide. The SsrA tag physically interacts with both ClpA and ClpX, targeting the polypeptides for degradation by ClpAP and ClpXP (23Haebel P.W. Gutmann S. Ban N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 15-aa 3The abbreviations used are: aa, amino acid(s); GFP, green fluorescent protein; FFL, firefly luciferase; RCMLa, reduced carboxymethylated lactalbumin; fRCMLa, fluorescein-labeled RCMLa; NTD, N-terminal domain; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). 3The abbreviations used are: aa, amino acid(s); GFP, green fluorescent protein; FFL, firefly luciferase; RCMLa, reduced carboxymethylated lactalbumin; fRCMLa, fluorescein-labeled RCMLa; NTD, N-terminal domain; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). peptide of RepA (MNQSFISDILYADIE) is another example of a peptide that, when fused either to the N or C termini of GFP, is sufficient to target the fusion protein for recognition and degradation by ClpAP (24Hoskins J.R. Kim S.Y. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35361-35367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Refolding of proteins trapped in aggregates requires not only Hsp104/ClpB but also a cognate Hsp70/40 chaperone system (2Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 25Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Zvi A.P. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that the Hsp70 system acts prior to the Hsp100, initially to produce lower order aggregates that still lack the ability to refold to the native state (26Zietkiewicz S. Lewandowska A. Stocki P. Liberek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7022-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A ClpB mutant containing a substitution in the coiled-coil domain is defective in processing aggregates that are dependent on the DnaK co-chaperone system but has no defect in the processing of unfolded proteins, suggesting a role for the coiled-coil domain in mediating a transfer of substrates from DnaK to ClpB (27Haslberger T. Weibezahn J. Zahn R. Lee S. Tsai F.T. Bukau B. Mogk A. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 247-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although it is possible that the Hsp70/40 may act as adaptor proteins that present refolding substrates to Hsp104/ClpB, it is not an obligatory pathway. In the absence of Hsp70, Hsp104 alone remodels yeast prion fibers formed by Sup35 and Ure2 (28Shorter J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 425-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Hsp104 in the presence of mixtures of ATP and slowly hydrolysable ATP analogues or a mutant of Hsp104 with reduced hydrolytic activity in the second AAA+ module can refold aggregated GFP and activate RepA for DNA binding without additional chaperones (29Doyle S.M. Shorter J. Zolkiewski M. Hoskins J.R. Lindquist S. Wickner S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Hsp104 can directly and independently recognize and process substrates, although the molecular basis of this interaction is unclear. We hypothesize that, like other Hsp100s, Hsp104 may initially engage substrates by binding to peptides displayed on the surface of aggregated proteins. Using peptide arrays, we found that potent Hsp104-binding peptides were enriched in charged and hydrophobic amino acids. Fusion of an Hsp104-binding peptide to the C terminus of firefly luciferase (FFL) enhanced its refolding in an Hsp104-dependent refolding reaction. Peptide binding to Hsp104, analyzed by fluorescence quenching using Hsp104 mutants containing tryptophan probes in the first (D1) and second (D2) AAA+ modules, revealed the existence of at least two unique peptide binding sites. Soluble peptide also competed for binding with a model unfolded protein, reduced carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin (RCMLa). We also analyzed protein and peptide binding of Hsp104 variants with amino acid substitutions in the axial channel and determined that inactivation of either pore loop abolished peptide and protein binding. However, stimulation of the ATPase activity in D2 was dependent on an intact loop in D1. These data demonstrate the potential for multiple modes of interaction between Hsp104 and segments of unfolded proteins as they are translocated through the axial channel and provide a hypothetical framework for allosteric triggering of ATP hydrolysis in protein unfolding. Hsp104 Mutagenesis—All oligonucleotide sequences used are listed in Table 1. The E285A and Y257W mutants were constructed by following the QuikChange (Stratagene) method using pBSKII+ containing the EagI/SacI segment of Hsp104 or from Hsp104Y257A (19Lum R. Tkach J.M.

The E687A mutant similarly was constructed using pBSKII+ containing the SalI/SpeI segment of Hsp104 using primers E687A(A) and E687A(B). Products were digested with DpnI, transformed into competent Escherichia coli cells, and colonies were screened for the destruction of a StyI-sensitive site for Y257W, the destruction of an NspI-sensitive restriction site for E285A, and the presence of a BtsI-sensitive restriction site for E687A. The expected sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The altered segments were subcloned in place of the corresponding wild-type EagI/SacI segment or SalI/SpeI segment of pPROEX-HT-b 104. The Hsp104Y257A, Hsp104Y662A, and Hsp104Y662W mutants were previously constructed (19Lum R. Tkach J.M. Vierling E. Glover J.R. J. Biol.

The Hsp104Y257A/Y662W mutant was constructed by subcloning a BamHI/SalI fragment from pLA28SX104Y257A into pPROEX-HT-b 104Y662W. Hsp104ΔN and Hsp104ΔNtrap were constructed by amplification of a segment of DNA using pPROEX-HT-b 104 with primers ΔN(FWD) and ΔN(REV). The PCR product was digested with BamHI/EagI and ligated into pPROEX-HT-b 104 or pPROEX-HT-b 104trap digested with the same enzymes.TABLE 1Primers used for plasmid construction The underlined residues indicate restriction endonuclease sites.PrimerSequenceE285A(A)GTGTTATTCATTGATGCAATTCATATGTTAATGGGTAATGgaBold indicates codon 285E285A(B)CCATTACCCATTAACATATGAATTGCATCAATGAATAACACaBold indicates codon 285E687A(A)CTCCGTTTTGTTATTCGATGCAGTGGAAAAGGCACATCCTGbBold indicates codon 687E687A(B)CAGGATGTCGCTTTTCCACTGCATCGAATAACAAAACGGAGbBold indicates codon 687Y257W(A)GCATTAACCGCAGGTGCTAAGTGGAAAGGTGATTTCGAAGcBold indicates codon 257Y257W(B)CTTCGAAATCACCTTTCCACTTAGCACCTGCGGTTAATGCcBold indicates codon 257ΔN(FWD)ACGTGGATCCGGGATGACTAGAATTGACTCTCGΔN(REV)ATCATCCGCGGTCTTGCGACGGCGACACCLUC(FWD)ATGCCATGGAAGACGCCAAAAACATAAAGAAAGGCLUC(REV)ACTGGATCCCAATTTGGACTTTCCGCCCTTCTTGGCp370(A)GATCCAAATTGTCTTTCGACGATGTTTTTGAAAGAGAGTATGCTTGACp370(B)TCGAGTCAAGCATACTCTCTTTCAAAAACATCGTCGAAAGACAATTTGp530(A)GATCCAATGATTTTCAGGAGCAACAAGAACAAGCAGCTCCAGAATGACp530(B)TCGAGTCATTCTGGAGCTGCTTGTTCTTGTTGCTCCTGAAAATCATTGpSGG(A)GATCCTCCGGAGGTTCAGGCGGTAGCGGTGGCAGTGGCGGGTCTTGACpSGG(B)TCGAGTCAAGACCCGCCACTGCCACCGCTACCGCCTGAACCTCCGGAGa Bold indicates codon 285b Bold indicates codon 687c Bold indicates codon 257 Open table in a new tab Construction of Firefly Luciferase-peptide Fusion Constructs—A segment of DNA was amplified from pPROEX-LUC, containing the WT FFL open reading frame and lacking a functional peroxisomal targeting signal, using the LUC(FWD) and LUC(REV) primers and digested with NcoI. The overhanging sequence was filled in using the large subunit of DNA polymerase I (Klenow) followed by BamHI digestion and ligation to BamHI-digested pBSKII+. The sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The NcoI/BamHI fragment was then subcloned into p416Gal1 (p416Gal1-LUC) for expression in yeast. Cartridge-purified oligonucleotide pairs encoding 14-mer peptides (p370(A), p370(B), p530(A), p530(B), pSGG(A), and pSGG(B)) at a concentration of 5 nm in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, were phosphorylated using polynucleotide kinase, annealed by heating to 95 °C, and slowly cooling to 25 °C (Δ0.1 °C/5 s), digested with BamHI/XhoI, and inserted into p416Gal1 LUC digested with the same enzymes. Correct insertion was confirmed by sequencing. For recombinant production of FFL fusion proteins, PacI/XhoI segments from p416Gal1-LUC series constructs were subcloned into pPROEX-LUC. Protein Purification—All Hsp104 variants were expressed and purified as described elsewhere (19Lum R. Tkach J.M. Vierling E. Glover J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29139-29146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Ydj1 was purified as described previously (30Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For purification of recombinant Ssa1, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain (SSA1, ssa2, ssa3, ssa4, and pCAUHSEM-SSA1) was grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase in YP containing 2% glucose. The culture was then supplemented with 0.1 volume of 10× YP (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone), 2% glucose, and 100 μm CuSO4, and the cells were allowed to induce overnight. Ssa1 was then purified essentially as described elsewhere (30Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For expression and purification of FFL and mutant variants, plasmids were transformed into BL21Codon plus cells, and expression of N-terminal poly-histidine-tagged FFL was induced in mid-log phase with 100 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 18 °C overnight. Harvested cells were resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 400 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol and lysed by French press. Poly-histidine-tagged FFL was isolated by chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen). Pooled peak fractions were diluted to 2 mg/ml, dialyzed twice against 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, and applied to anion exchange chromatography. Peak fractions were dialyzed twice against 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.8 m ammonium sulfate, and 2% glycerol, and frozen at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Assay Reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides arrays were produced by spot synthesis on cellulose membranes according to the manufacturer's directions (Intavis, Germany). Soluble peptides were synthesized at the Advanced Protein Technology Center (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). Stock peptide solutions were made freshly by resuspending to 1 mm in sterile water. Concentrations were determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm or using the Bio-Rad Assay Reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Hsp104 Binding to Peptide Arrays—Arrays were blocked in 1× Blocking Solution (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), rinsed three times in binding buffer, and overlaid with 35 nm Hsp104trap in the presence of 2 mm ATP for 1 h at room temperature. Unbound Hsp104 was removed by extensive washing in binding buffer containing ATP. Bound protein was then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride using a semidry blotter, and Hsp104 was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody. Immunoreactive spots were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and recorded on a Versadoc imaging system (Bio-Rad). Spot density was determined using IP Lab Gel 2.0. The frequency of amino acid occurrence was calculated as follows. Observed frequency=(no. of aa x in binders)/(total no. of aa in binders)Observed frequency=(no. of aa x in binders)/(total no. of aa in binders)(Eq. 1) Total frequency=(no. of aa x in all peptides)/(total no. of aa in all peptides)(Eq. 2) Frequency=(observed frequency/total frequency)−1(Eq. 3) A poly-l-lysine spot on each array was used as an internal positive control for Hsp104 binding and as a standard to compare spot intensities between blots. Fluorescein Labeling of Reduced α-Lactalbumin—Reduced carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin (RCMLa, Sigma) labeling with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Invitrogen) was performed according to the manufacturer's directions. The labeled protein was purified on a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. Peak fractions were pooled, filtered, and stored at 4 °C in the dark until use. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Nucleotide binding measured by changes in Trp fluorescence was performed as previously described (19Lum R. Tkach J.M. Vierling E. Glover J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29139-29146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). All solutions were filtered (0.22 μm) or centrifuged (16,000 × g for 10 min) to remove particulate matter. To measure peptide binding, fluorescence of 0.6 μm Hsp104 containing 2 mm nucleotide was measured at 352 nm at 25 °C using a Spex Fluorolog-3 (Jobin-Yvon), with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and a 5 nm bandpass. Peptides were titrated from a 100 μm stock solution. Each sample was stirred for 5 min before reading. Data were fitted to a single-site saturation equation for binding using MacCurveFit. Fluorescence anisotropy was measured as previously described (31Bosl B. Grimminger V. Walter S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38170-38176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) in reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with several exceptions. 0.6 μm Hsp104trap was incubated with or without 2 mm nucleotide at 25 °C for 5 min. For inhibition of fluorescein-labeled RCMLa (fRCMLa) binding to Hsp104, competitors were added to a solution containing Hsp104 and ATP and incubated for 10 min, and reactions were initiated by the addition of fRCMLa to 0.06 μm. The fraction of fRCMLa bound to Hsp104 was calculated using Equation 4, % Bound=100×(r−rfree)/[(rbound−r)+(r−rfree)](Eq. 4) where r represents anisotropy. For competition of fRCMLa binding post-Hsp104-fRCMLa complex formation, fRCMLa was added to initiate the binding reaction, and upon completion of the reaction, competitors were added to 9 μm. Refolding of Denatured Aggregated Luciferase—In vivo and in vitro refolding of FFL was performed as described elsewhere (32Tkach J.M. Glover J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35692-35701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In vitro refolding reactions were supplemented with 100 μm soluble peptides. Luciferase Aggregation Assay—Experiments were performed as described elsewhere (33Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) with several modifications. FFL was thermally aggregated at 0.2 μm in a polystyrene 96-well flat-bottom plate (Sarstedt, Germany) at 42 °C in reaction buffer supplemented with 5 mm ATP in the presence or absence of 0.8 μm Ssa1 and 1.6 μm Ydj1. Rates of FFL aggregation were determined by monitoring increases in light scattering using a SpectraMax 340PC384 microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at 370 nm. ATPase Activity—A coupled enzymatic spectrophotometric assay in combination with an ATP-regenerating system (34Norby J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) was used to monitor ATP hydrolysis by Hsp104. All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise indicated. Reactions were carried out in reaction buffer containing 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.23 mm NADH (Bioshop, Canada), 70 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 100 units/ml l-lactate dehydrogenase (both obtained from rabbit muscle), 2 mm ATP, and 0.2 μm Hsp104. Assays were performed in a polystyrene 96-well flat-bottom plate using a SpectraMax 340PC384 microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at 30 °C monitoring NADH oxidation at 340 nm. The ATPase rate was calculated from the slope dA340 nm/dt using a molar extinction coefficient for NADH of ϵ340 nm = 6200 m-1cm-1. Data were fitted to either a line or a rectangular hyperbola. Screen for Hsp104-interacting Peptides—We initiated our search for Hsp104-interacting peptides by screening solid-phase arrays of peptides corresponding to overlapping 13-mer segments of a variety of proteins. Array membranes were incubated with an Hsp104 “trap” mutant (E285A/E687A, Hsp104trap; see Fig. 1A for a schematic guide to Hsp104 domains and residues relevant to this work) that binds but does not hydrolyze ATP (35Weibezahn J. Schlieker C. Bukau B. Mogk A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32608-32617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). After electrophoretic transfer of bound proteins, Hsp104 was detected with a polyclonal antibody. Strong Hsp104-binding peptides were defined as peptides in the 95th percentile by normalized spot intensity (156 of 3908 peptides). The relative fractional occurrence of each amino acid in the strongest binders against the natural occurrence of all 20 amino acids in all peptides was determined (Fig. 1B). We found that Hsp104-binding peptides were enriched in aromatic residues (phenylalanine and tyrosine) and charged residues, specifically lysine, asparagine, and aspartic acid. Serine, glycine, proline, and tryptophan were under-represented in these peptides. The abundances of cysteine and methionine residues on the arrays were too low to be considered statistically significant. Molecular chaperones are thought to be able to discriminate between folded and unfolded proteins by the high degree of exposure of hydrophobic residues on the surface of misfolded proteins compared with their native conformers. To provide insight into the location of Hsp104-binding peptides within a natively folded protein, we used binding data from a peptide array corresponding to the primary sequence of the globular domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sup35 (Fig. 1C) and mapped them onto a model based on the crystal structure of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe protein (36Kong C. Ito K. Walsh M.A. Wada M. Liu Y. Kumar S. Barford D. Nakamura Y. Song H. Molecular Cell. 2004; 14: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Analysis of the solvent accessibility of these peptides indicated that they were generally buried in the interior of the folded protein (Fig. 1C) consistent with their generally high content of hydrophobic amino acid residues. However, because further studies on peptide binding to Hsp104 in solution would be dependent on the solubility of peptides over a broad range of concentrations, we focused on those array peptides containing hydrophobic amino acids intermixed with charged or polar residues. Peptides Can Enhance Refolding of Aggregated Protein—Other Hsp100s apparently initiate unfolding by binding to specific peptide sequences. For example, the SsrA tag appended onto the C terminus of GFP is sufficient to direct the degradation of GFP by the ClpXP protease (37Kim Y.I. Burton R.E. Burton B.M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, peptides selected for their ClpX binding properties from arrays conferred ClpX binding to a GFP peptide fusion protein but failed to promote GFP degradation in the presence of ClpP (38Thibault G. Yudin J. Wong P. Tsitrin V. Sprangers R. Zhao R. Houry W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 17724-17729Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This result could represent the manifestation of the formal possibility that some peptides on arrays could interact with the probe protein in an adventitious manner. For example, peptides could bind to the outer surfaces of the chaperone as opposed to within the axial channel where substrate processing most likely occurs. We therefore adopted a functional approach to test whether candidate peptides could enhance the refolding of aggregated FFL, a robust model refolding substrate for Hsp104 in vivo (32Tkach J.M. Glover J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35692-35701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 39Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) and in vitro (2Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments candidate peptides were fused to FFL as C-terminal extensions and expressed in yeast. None of the peptides, that failed to bind Hsp104 on solid phase arrays and were incorporated into these experiments as negative controls, influenced FFL-peptide fusion protein refolding following thermal denaturation. However, some but not all peptides that were judged to be strong Hsp104-binders on solid phase arrays enhanced the recovery of thermally denatured FFL in vivo (data not shown). To more rigorously determine the influence of peptide extensions on FFL refolding, two peptides that both bound Hsp104 on arrays and enhanced in vivo refolding of FFL, p370 (KLSFDDVFEREYA) and p530 (NDFQEQQEQAAPE), as well as a non-binding control peptide pSGG (SGGSGGSGGSGGS), were further tested in in vitro refolding reactions using Hsp104 along with the Hsp70/40 chaperones Ssa1 and Ydj1 (2Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). FFL-pSGG was refolded with the same efficiency as FFL lacking a peptide extension (Fig. 2A). Fusion of p530 to FFL modestly enhanced the refolding yield, whereas FFL-p370 was refolded completely. These results are consistent with the notion that Hsp104-binding peptides confer an additional element that enhances the recognition or processing of FFL that is not present in FFL lacking a peptide extension. However, it is possible that enhanced refolding of FFL-peptide fusions could be attributable to differences in the agg"
https://openalex.org/W1976131051,"We have previously demonstrated a role for pyruvate cycling in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Some of the possible pyruvate cycling pathways are completed by conversion of malate to pyruvate by malic enzyme. Using INS-1-derived 832/13 cells, it has recently been shown by other laboratories that NADP-dependent cytosolic malic enzyme (MEc), but not NAD-dependent mitochondrial malic enzyme (MEm), regulates GSIS. In the current study, we show that small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of either MEm or MEc results in decreased GSIS in both 832/13 cells and a new and more glucose- and incretin-responsive INS-1-derived cell line, 832/3. The effect of MEm to suppress GSIS in these cell lines was linked to a substantial decrease in cell growth, whereas MEc suppression resulted in decreased NADPH, shown previously to be correlated with GSIS. However, adenovirus-mediated delivery of small interfering RNAs specific to MEc and MEm to isolated rat islets, while leading to effective suppression of the targets transcripts, had no effect on GSIS. Furthermore, islets isolated from MEc-null MOD1(-/-) mice exhibit normal glucose- and potassium-stimulated insulin secretion. These results indicate that pyruvate-malate cycling does not control GSIS in primary rodent islets."
https://openalex.org/W1969996799,"Background Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is a major angiogenic factor involved in angiogenesis and arteriogenesis, however the regulation of its expression during these processes is poorly documented. FGF2 mRNA contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), a translational regulator expected to allow mRNA expression during cellular stress. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we have developed a skin ischemia model in transgenic mice expressing a reporter transgene under the control of the FGF2 IRES. The results reveal that FGF2 is induced at the protein level during ischemia, concomitant with HIF-1α induction and a decrease in FGF2 mRNA. In addition, the FGF2 IRES is strongly activated under these ischemic conditions associated with hypoxia, whereas cap-dependent translation is repressed by 4E-BP hypophosphorylation. We also show that up-regulation of FGF2 protein expression in response to hypoxia correlates with the increase of FGF2 IRES activity in vitro, in human retinoblasts 911. The use of siRNAs targeting HIF or FGF2 indicates that FGF2 and HIF-1α reciprocally regulate their expression/accumulation, by a negative feedback loop in early hypoxia, followed by a positive feedback loop in late hypoxia. Conclusion/Significance FGF2 expression is up-regulated in vivo and in vitro in response to hypoxia. Strikingly, this up-regulation is not transcriptional. It seems to occur by an IRES-dependent mechanism, revealing new mechanistic aspects of the hypoxic response. In addition, our data show that FGF2 interacts with HIF-1α in a unique crosstalk, with distinct stages in early and late hypoxia. These data reveal the physiological importance of IRES-dependent translation during hypoxic stress and underline the complexity of the cellular response to hypoxia, suggesting a novel role of FGF2 in the regulation of HIF-1α during the induction of angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1981276526,"Heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) regulate gene expression in response to heat shock and in physiological conditions. In mammals, HSF1 is required for heat-mediated induction of classic heat shock genes; however, we do not know the molecular mechanisms by which HSF4 regulates gene expression or the biological consequences of its binding to chromatin. Here, we identified that HSF4 binds to various genomic regions, including the introns and distal parts of protein-coding genes in vivo in mouse lenses, and a substantial numbers of the regions were also occupied by HSF1 and HSF2. HSF4 regulated expression of some genes at a developmental stage when HSF1 and HSF2 expression decreased. Although HSF4 binding did not affect expression of many genes, it induces demethylated status of histone H3K9 on the binding regions. Unexpectedly, a lot of HSF4 targets were induced by heat shock treatment, and HSF4 is required for induction of a set of non-classic heat shock genes in response to heat shock, in part by facilitating HSF1 binding through chromatin modification. These results suggest novel mechanisms of gene regulation controlled by HSF4 in non-classic heat shock response and in lens development."
https://openalex.org/W1995468228,"Previous studies with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) have focused on the cortical representation of limited group of muscles. No attempts have been carried out so far to get simultaneous recordings from hand, forearm and arm with TMS in order to disentangle a 'functional' map providing information on the rules orchestrating muscle coupling and overlap. The aim of the present study is to disentangle functional associations between 12 upper limb muscles using two measures: cortical overlapping and cortical covariation of each pair of muscles. Interhemispheric differences and the influence of posture were evaluated as well.TMS mapping studies of 12 muscles belonging to hand, forearm and arm were performed. Findings demonstrate significant differences between the 66 pairs of muscles in terms of cortical overlapping: extremely high for hand-forearm muscles and very low for arm vs hand/forearm muscles. When right and left hemispheres were compared, overlapping between all possible pairs of muscles in the left hemisphere (62.5%) was significantly higher than in the right one (53.5% ). The arm/hand posture influenced both measures of cortical association, the effect of Position being significant [p = .021] on overlapping, resulting in 59.5% with prone vs 53.2% with supine hand, but only for pairs of muscles belonging to hand and forearm, while no changes occurred in the overlapping of proximal muscles with those of more distal districts.Larger overlapping in the left hemisphere could be related to its lifetime higher training of all twelve muscles studied with respect to the right hemisphere, resulting in larger intra-cortical connectivity within primary motor cortex. Altogether, findings with prone hand might be ascribed to mechanisms facilitating coupling of muscles for object grasping and lifting -with more proximal involvement for joint stabilization- compared to supine hand facilitating actions like catching. TMS multiple-muscle mapping studies permit a better understanding of motor control and 'plastic' reorganization of motor system."
https://openalex.org/W2031806473,"Intramyocardial injection of skeletal myoblasts (SMB) has been shown to be a promising strategy for treating post-infarction chronic heart failure. However, insufficient therapeutic benefit and occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias are concerns. We hypothesised that the use of a retrograde intracoronary route for SMB-delivery might favourably alter the behaviour of the grafted SMB, consequently modulating the therapeutic effects and arrhythmogenicity.Three weeks after coronary artery ligation in female wild-type rats, 5x10(6) GFP-expressing SMB or PBS only (control) were injected via either the intramyocardial or retrograde intracoronary routes. Injection of SMB via either route similarly improved cardiac performance and physical activity, associated with reduced cardiomyocyte-hypertrophy and fibrosis. Grafted SMB via either route were only present in low numbers in the myocardium, analysed by real-time PCR for the Y-chromosome specific gene, Sry. Cardiomyogenic differentiation of grafted SMB was extremely rare. Continuous ECG monitoring by telemetry revealed that only intramyocardial injection of SMB produced spontaneous ventricular tachycardia up to 14 days, associated with local myocardial heterogeneity generated by clusters of injected SMB and accumulated inflammatory cells. A small number of ventricular premature contractions with latent ventricular tachycardia were detected in the late-phase of SMB injection regardless of the injection-route.Retrograde intracoronary injection of SMB provided significant therapeutic benefits with attenuated early-phase arrhythmogenicity in treating ischaemic cardiomyopathy, indicating the promising utility of this route for SMB-delivery. Late-phase arrhythmogenicity remains a concern, regardless of the delivery route."
https://openalex.org/W1986408163,"Stimulation of G(q)-coupled receptors activates phospholipase C and is supposed to promote both intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization and protein kinase C (PKC) activation. We found that ADP-induced phosphorylation of pleckstrin, the main platelet substrate for PKC, was completely inhibited not only by an antagonist of the G(q)-coupled P2Y1 receptor but also upon blockade of the G(i)-coupled P2Y12 receptor. The role of G(i) on PKC regulation required stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase rather than inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. P2Y12 antagonists also inhibited pleckstrin phosphorylation, Rap1b activation, and platelet aggregation induced upon G(q) stimulation by the thromboxane A(2) analogue U46619. Importantly, activation of phospholipase C and intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization occurred normally. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate overcame the inhibitory effect of P2Y12 receptor blockade on PKC activation but not on Rap1b activation and platelet aggregation. By contrast, inhibition of diacylglycerol kinase restored both PKC and Rap1b activity and caused platelet aggregation. Stimulation of P2Y12 receptor or direct inhibition of diacylglycerol kinase potentiated the effect of membrane-permeable sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol on platelet aggregation and pleckstrin phosphorylation, in association with inhibition of its phosphorylation to phosphatidic acid. These results reveal a novel and unexpected role of the G(i)-coupled P2Y12 receptor in the regulation of diacylglycerol-mediated events in activated platelets."
https://openalex.org/W2073863845,"The Group IVA (GIVA) phospholipase A2 associates with natural membranes in response to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ along with increases in certain lipid mediators. This enzyme associates with the membrane surface as well as binding a single phospholipid molecule in the active site for catalysis. Employing deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we have identified the regions of the protein binding the lipid surface and conformational changes upon a single phospholipid binding in the absence of a lipid surface. Experiments were carried out using natural palmitoyl arachidonyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles with the intact GIVA enzyme as well as the isolated C2 and catalytic domains. Lipid binding produced changes in deuterium exchange in eight different regions of the protein. The regions with decreased exchange included Ca2+ binding loop one, which has been proposed to penetrate the membrane surface, and a charged patch of residues, which may be important in interacting with the polar head groups of phospholipids. The regions with an increase in exchange are all located either in the hydrophobic core underneath the lid region or near the lid and hinge regions from 403 to 457. Using the GIVA phospholipase A2 irreversible inhibitor methyl-arachidonyl fluorophosphonate, we were able to isolate structural changes caused only by pseudo-substrate binding. This produced results that were very similar to natural lipid binding in the presence of a lipid interface with the exception of the C2 domain and region 466-470. This implies that most of the changes seen in the catalytic domain are due to a substrate-mediated, not interface-mediated, lid opening, which exposes the active site to water. Finally experiments carried out with inhibitor plus phospholipid vesicles showed decreases at the C2 domain as well as charged residues on the putative membrane binding surface of the catalytic domain revealing the binding sites of the enzyme to the lipid surface.

This enzyme was initially isolated from human platelets, and it is specific for phospholipids containing arachidonic acid in the sn-2 position (3Clark J.D. Lin L.L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S.

The release of arachidonic acid is the critical first step in the biosynthesis of eicosanoids, which are potent mediators of inflammation and pain (5Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar). There are a number of enzymes and routes by which arachidonic acid can be released from phospholipids, but experiments with GIVA PLA2 knock-out mice have demonstrated its importance in many inflammatory processes (6Bonventre J.V.

The enzyme is composed of two domains, a Ca2+ binding C2 domain and a α/β-hydrolase domain that contains the catalytic site (9Nalefski E.A. Sultzman L.A. Martin D.M. Kriz R.W. Towler P.S. Knopf J.L.

For the enzyme to be active, it must be sequestered to a phospholipid interface. Binding Ca2+ to the C2 domain accomplishes this as does the binding of two different lipid mediators, e.g. ceramide 1 phosphate (12Stahelin R.V. Subramanian P. Vora M. Cho W. Chalfant C.E. J. Biol.

The Ca2+ binding C2 domain is a conserved domain that is present on many different lipid-binding proteins (16Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32407-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding to this domain sequesters the protein to the lipid surface. Extensive studies have been carried out on the C2 domain using a variety of techniques to determine how Ca2+ binding accomplishes lipid surface binding. These studies have included x-ray reflectivity, site-directed mutagenesis, NMR, EPR, and computational methods (17Perisic O. Paterson H.F. Mosedale G. Lara-Gonzalez S. Williams R.L. J. Biol.

However, these studies only deal with C2 binding to the membrane, not the intact cPLA2 enzyme. How the presence of the α/β-hydrolase domain affects surface binding has not been determined in detail due to the difficulties of working with such a large protein. Unlike the C2 domain, the binding of the catalytic domain of the enzyme to the lipid surface has not been extensively studied. Numerous studies using site-directed mutagenesis of the intact protein have localized amino acids that are important for lipid binding and activation by secondary lipid mediators, as well as activation by phosphorylation of specific residues, especially residue Ser-505 (24Das S. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23838-23846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25Das S. Rafter J.D. Kim K.P. Gygi S.P. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41431-41442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We have also shown that there is an increase in activity upon binding phosphatidyl-inositol-(4,5) bis-phosphate-containing lipids in a specific lysine binding pocket (14Mosior M. Six D.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2184-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 15Six D.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23842-23850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The enzyme has been shown to be minimally active on monomeric lipid substrates but has substantial activation upon binding an interfacial surface (9Nalefski E.A. Sultzman L.A. Martin D.M. Kriz R.W. Towler P.S. Knopf J.L. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18239-18249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme also contains a lid region spanning amino acids 415-432 that covers the active site. Many different lipase proteins exist in a closed lid conformation, and upon lipid binding, the enzyme shifts to an open lid conformation, causing interfacial activation (26Roussel A. Miled N.

Nature. 1991; 351: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Many of these open lid conformations have been crystallized in the presence of an inhibitor binding in the active site (PDB 1K8Q) (26Roussel A. Miled N. Berti-Dupuis L. Riviere M. Spinelli S. Berna P. Gruber V. Verger R. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2266-2274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Other than the crystal structure of the native GIVA PLA2 with the lid region obstructing the active site, there has been no evidence for this mechanism in the GIVA enzyme. The technique of deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (DXMS) is well equipped to examine the issues of the catalytic domain binding the lipid surface, as well as examining the conformational changes upon the lid region opening. We have recently demonstrated for the first time that DXMS can be used to characterize membrane lipid binding to a PLA2 (29Burke J.E. Karbarz M.J. Deems R.A. Li S. Woods Jr., V.L. Dennis E.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 6451-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Peptide amide hydrogen deuterium exchange analyzed via liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry has been widely used to analyze protein-protein interactions (30Hamuro Y. Anand G.S. Kim J.S. Juliano C.

We have recently conducted deuterium exchange studies on the GIVA enzyme showing intradomain interactions of the enzyme as well as structural changes caused by Ca2+ binding (35Hsu Y.H. Burke J.E. Stephens D.L. Deems R.A. Li S. Asmus K.M. Woods Jr., V.L. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9820-9827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This technique is an excellent way to probe the effects of lipid binding across the entire enzyme. The present study represents a continuation of our studies of PLA2 binding a lipid surface (29Burke J.E. Karbarz M.J. Deems R.A. Li S. Woods Jr., V.L. Dennis E.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 6451-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We have now identified specific regions of the GIVA PLA2 that bind the lipid surface, specifically regions 28-39, 268-279, and 466-470. We now have also demonstrated conformational changes in regions 391-397, 481-495, and 543-553 hypothesized to be due to the conversion from the closed to the open lid conformation of the enzyme induced by natural phospholipid as well as the specific inhibitor MAFP binding to the active site of the enzyme. All reagents were analytical reagent grade or better. Protein Expression and Purification—C-terminal His6-tagged GIVA PLA2, and the C2 and catalytic domains were expressed using recombinant baculovirus in a suspension culture of Sf9 insect cells. The cell pellet was lysed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm EGTA, and then the insoluble portion was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was passed through a column comprised of 6 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The protein in the native state was eluted in the “protein buffer” (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 125 mm imidazole, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). The protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) to the manufacturer's standards, and the activity was assayed using mixed micelles in a modified Dole assay (36Lucas K.K. Dennis E.A. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2005; 77: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using the same conditions employed for deuterium exchange experiments. Purified GIVA PLA2 (2 mg/ml) was stored in the protein buffer on ice for DXMS experiments. Experiments were performed immediately after elution from the nickel column. Preparation of Lipid Vesicles—Lipid vesicles were prepared by evaporating solutions of 1-palmitoyl 2-arachidonic phosphatidyl-choline in chloroform under argon to dryness. The lipid film was resuspended in 100 mm KCl and allowed to sit in a 40 °C water bath for 30 min. The lipid solution was then probe sonicated five times for 30 s each with 30-s breaks in ice between sonications. This solution was then centrifuged at 5,000 × g to remove large lipid aggregates and titanium particles released from the probe sonicator. This solution was then used immediately for deuterium exchange studies. Small unilamellar vesicles were chosen for this study because kinetic studies performed with both small unilamellar vesicles and large unilamellar vesicles with the GIVA PLA2 have shown similar kinetics (25Das S. Rafter J.D. Kim K.P. Gygi S.P. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41431-41442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 37Hixon M.S. Ball A. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8516-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have previously used this technique with small unilamellar vesicles on the GIA PLA2 to study lipid binding (29Burke J.E. Karbarz M.J. Deems R.A. Li S. Woods Jr., V.L. Dennis E.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 6451-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and we chose to expand on this using GIVA PLA2. Preparation of Deuterated samples for On-Exchange Experiments—D2O buffer contained 10 mm Tris (pD 7.5), 50 mm NaCl in 98% D20. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments were initiated by mixing 20 μl of GIVA PLA2 or the C2 domain or catalytic domain (containing 40 μg) in protein buffer with 60 μl of D2O buffer to a final concentration of 73% D2O at pH 7.5. In lipid vesicle and MAFP binding experiments, the GIVA PLA2 in protein buffer was preincubated in the presence of 60 μm MAFP added froma 1 mm stock dissolved in ethanol and/or 2 mm PAPC vesicles in a 23 °C water bath for 1 min. The final concentration of ethanol was 0.25% for experiments with MAFP and MAFP controls. MAFP was allowed to incubate with the enzyme for 3 h on ice followed by 10 min at room temperature pre-D2O incubation. The D2O buffer was then added, and the samples were incubated at 23 °C for an additional 10, 30, 100, 300, 1,000, 3,000, or 10,000 s. For experiments with lipid present, time points were only taken while the percentage of hydrolysis of the lipid vesicles was under 10%. The activity of the enzyme against these lipid vesicles was measured using a modified Dole assay that exactly matched deuterium exchange conditions (33Hoofnagle A.N. Resing K.A. Goldsmith E.J. Ahn N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 956-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The deuterium exchange was quenched by adding 120 μl of ice-cold quench solution (0.96% formic acid, 1.66 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdHCl)) that acidified the sample to a final pH = 2.5 and concentrations of formic acid of 0.58% and 1 m GdHCl. The samples were placed on ice for 10 min to partially denature the protein and obtain optimal peptide maps. Vials with frozen samples were stored at -80 °C until analysis, usually within 3 days. Proteolysis-Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Samples—All steps were performed at 0 °C as described previously (30Hamuro Y. Anand G.S. Kim J.S. Juliano C. Stranz D.D. Taylor S.S. Woods Jr., V.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 32Brudler R. Gessner C.R. Li S. Tyndall S. Getzoff E.D. Woods Jr., V.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The samples were hand-thawed on melting ice and injected onto and passed through a protease column (66-μl bed volume) filled with porcine pepsin (Sigma) and immobilized on Poros 20 AL medium (Applied Biosystems) at 30 mg/ml following the manufacturer's instructions, at a flow rate of 100 μl/min with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluate from the pepsin column was directly loaded onto a C18 column (Vydac catalog number 218MS5150). The peptides were eluted at 50 μl/min with a linear gradient of 0.046% trifluoroacetic acid, 6.4% (v/v) acetonitrile to 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid, 38.4% acetonitrile for 30 min. The eluate from the C18 column was directed to a Finnigan Classic LCQ mass spectrometer via its electrospray mass ionization probe operated with a capillary temperature of 200 °C as described previously (30Hamuro Y. Anand G.S. Kim J.S. Juliano C. Stranz D.D. Taylor S.S. Woods Jr., V.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 32Brudler R. Gessner C.R. Li S. Tyndall S. Getzoff E.D. Woods Jr., V.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Data Processing—SEQUEST software (Thermo Finnigan Inc.) was used to identify the sequence of the peptide ions. DXMS Explorer (Sierra Analytics Inc, Modesto CA) was used for the analysis of the mass spectra as described previously (30Hamuro Y. Anand G.S. Kim J.S. Juliano C. Stranz D.D. Taylor S.S. Woods Jr., V.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 32Brudler R. Gessner C.R. Li S. Tyndall S. Getzoff E.D. Woods Jr., V.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All selected peptides had first passed the quality control threshold of the software and were then manually checked to ensure that the observed mass envelope agreed with the calculated mass envelope. The highest signal/noise ion was picked if multiple ionization charges (1Schaloske R.H. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 1246-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 2Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar, or 3Clark J.D. Lin L.L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar) of a peptide were detected. Incorporated deuteron number was obtained by measuring the centroid shift between the non-deuterated and the partially deuterated mass envelope. The deuteration level of each peptide was calculated by the ratio of the incorporated deuteron number to the maximum possible deuteration number. Peptide deuteration levels in replicate samples, measured by our DXMS methods, have been found to vary by less than 10%, and we therefore regard changes greater than 10% as significant (30Hamuro Y. Anand G.S. Kim J.S. Juliano C. Stranz D.D. Taylor S.S. Woods Jr., V.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at least twice, and representative data are shown. Trends in the data were similar from experiment to experiment, but total deuterium content varied by roughly 5-10% in similar experiments carried out weeks apart. For all regions that showed a greater then 10% increase or decrease, other peptides that include some or all of the regions of interest are provided in the supplemental data. GIVA PLA2 Coverage Map of Pepsin Fragmentation—The protein digestion procedure was optimized to produce a peptide map that yielded the best coverage of GIVA PLA2 as described previously (35Hsu Y.H. Burke J.E. Stephens D.L. Deems R.A. Li S. Asmus K.M. Woods Jr., V.L. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9820-9827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The optimized condition gave 157 distinct peptides that gave 92% coverage of the GIVA PLA2 sequence. The same condition was used to digest the C2 domain, which generated 32 peptides covering 89% of the sequence (Fig. 1). Sixty-one peptide fragments are shown that cover 82% of the protein, and 17 peptide fragments for the C2 domain, covering 89% of the sequence, were analyzed for the data shown in the figures. These peptides are shown in Fig. 1 as bold lines. In this report, when we use the term “peptide,” we are referring to an actual peptide that was identified in the pepsin digestion. When we use the term “region,” we are referring to a section of the protein for which the deuterium exchange has been calculated, but it may or may not correspond to an actual pepsin peptide. C2 Lipid Binding Experiments—On-Exchange experiments were performed on the isolated C2 domain containing amino acids 12-140. C2 domain lipid binding has been extensively studied by other techniques, and these studies served as an important control to compare this technique against previously published results obtained with other approaches. C2 on-exchange experiments were performed under five different conditions (Fig. 2). The change in exchange upon binding to 500 μm lipid vesicles was tested in the presence of 0, 200, and 1000 μm Ca2+. Significant decreases upon exposure to the lipid surface were only achieved in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 2) and not with 0 or 200 μm Ca2+ (data not shown). The changes in exchange upon Ca2+ binding were exactly the same as the changes observed with intact full-length cPLA2 (35Hsu Y.H. Burke J.E. Stephens D.L. Deems R.A. Li S. Asmus K.M. Woods Jr., V.L. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9820-9827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and included regions 28-35, 51-71, 101-106, and 125-129 as well as a new region 41-48 (data not shown). This new region 41-48 is part of the C2 domain that shows very slow exchange rates in the full enzyme and faster exchange in the C2-only domain (35Hsu Y.H. Burke J.E. Stephens D.L. Deems R.A. Li S. Asmus K.M. Woods Jr., V.L. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9820-9827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A significant decrease in exchange due to binding of lipid vesicles was seen in the region 36-39, as well as a small change in the region 28-35 in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ and PAPC lipid vesicles (Fig. 2). These regions include the hydrophobic residues Phe-35, Met-38, and Leu-39 present on the first Ca2+ binding loop. Previous work has also implicated region 96-98 in lipid binding (17Perisic O.

These results agree with the previous experiments demonstrating lipid binding of the C2 domain alone. cPLA2 Lipid Binding Experiments—On-Exchange experiments were performed on the intact cPLA2 enzyme in the presence of a phospholipid membrane to determine how the catalytic domain interacts with the surface and to determine whether it changed membrane binding of the C2 domain. These experiments were carried out in the presence of 500 μm PAPC and 200 μm Ca2+ for time points varying from 10 to 300 s. The literature Kd values of this enzyme interacting with membranes varies from 1 to 90 μm depending on the presentation of the lipid substrate (25Das S. Rafter J.D. Kim K.P. Gygi S.P. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41431-41442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 37Hixon M.S. Ball A. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8516-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Generation of product interfering with membrane binding was a concern in these experiments. For this reason, these experiments were carried out at shorter time points with low levels of Ca2+ to keep the hydrolysis of phospholipids at the lipid membrane below 10%. Experiments were carried out testing lipid binding in the presence of 1 mm EGTA to test binding without Ca2+. No changes greater then 10% were observed upon lipid binding without Ca2+ present. Activity assays were done under the same experimental conditions as the deuterium exchange experiments to measure the levels of arachidonic acid release. In the presence of 200 μm Ca2+, the percentage of hydrolysis at 10 s was ∼0.2%, and the percentage of hydrolysis proceeded to 6% at 300 s. Samples taken at 1000 s showed 16% hydrolysis, and we decided to limit our time course to only 300 s. The specific activity of the enzyme under our conditions was ∼20 nmol min-1 mg-1, which is consistent with literature values under similar protein to lipid ratios (25Das S. Rafter J.D. Kim K.P.

Four regions of the protein (28-39, 258-265, 268-279, and 466-470) exhibited decreased exchange in the presence of lipid vesicles (Fig. 3). Multiple additional peptides covered portions of these regions, and peptide data for these regions is shown in supplemental Fig. 1. Region 28-39 exhibited similar changes in deuterium exchange as did the isolated C2 domain. Changes were seen due to membrane surface binding in the intact enzyme in"
https://openalex.org/W2051546400,"Nucleotide insertions in the ferritin light chain (FTL) polypeptide gene cause hereditary ferritinopathy, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by abnormal accumulation of ferritin and iron in the central nervous system. Here we describe for the first time the protein structure and iron storage function of the FTL mutant p.Phe167SerfsX26 (MT-FTL), which has a C terminus altered in sequence and extended in length. MT-FTL polypeptides assembled spontaneously into soluble, spherical 24-mers that were ultrastructurally indistinguishable from those of the wild type. Far-UV CD showed a decrease in alpha-helical content, and 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate fluorescence revealed the appearance of hydrophobic binding sites. Near-UV CD and proteolysis studies suggested little or no structural alteration outside of the C-terminal region. In contrast to wild type, MT-FTL homopolymers precipitated at much lower iron loading, had a diminished capacity to incorporate iron, and were less thermostable. However, precipitation was significantly reversed by addition of iron chelators both in vitro and in vivo. Our results reveal substantial protein conformational changes localized at the 4-fold pore of MT-FTL homopolymers and imply that the C terminus of the MT-FTL polypeptide plays an important role in ferritin solubility, stability, and iron management. We propose that the protrusion of some portion of the C terminus above the spherical shell allows it to cross-link with other mutant polypeptides through iron bridging, leading to enhanced mutant precipitation by iron. Our data suggest that hereditary ferritinopathy pathogenesis is likely to result from a combination of reduction in iron storage function and enhanced toxicity associated with iron-induced ferritin aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W2166179890,"Plasma proteins such as early complement components and IgM are involved in the removal of late apoptotic or secondary necrotic (sn) cells. We have recently described how a plasma protease that could be inhibited by the protease inhibitor aprotinin was essential to remove nucleosomes from sn cells. An obvious candidate, plasmin, did indeed have nucleosome-releasing factor (NRF) activity. However, recalcified plasma (r-plasma) retained its NRF activity after plasminogen depletion, which suggests the existence of another protease responsible for NRF activity in plasma. In this study we have used size-exclusion and anion-exchange chromatography to purify the protease responsible for NRF activity in plasma. SDS-PAGE analysis of chromatography fractions containing NRF activity revealed a protein band corresponding with NRF activity. Sequence analysis showed this band to be factor VII-activating protease (FSAP). We developed monoclonal antibodies to FSAP and were able to completely inhibit NRF activity in plasma with monoclonal antibodies to FSAP. Using affinity chromatography we were able to purify single-chain (sc) FSAP from r-plasma. Purified scFSAP efficiently removes nucleosomes from sn cells. We report that factor VII-activating protease may function in cellular homeostasis by catalyzing the release of nucleosomes from secondary necrotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2169099703,"Cyclooxygenase (COX) -1 and COX-2 are expressed in airway cells, where their activities influence functions such as airway hyperreactivity. Clinical data show that mixed COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors such as aspirin, but not COX-2 selective inhibitors such as rofecoxib, induce bronchoconstriction and asthma in sensitive individuals. This anomaly has not yet been explained. Here, we have used tissue from genetically modified mice lacking functional COX-1 (COX-1−/−), as well as airway tissue from “aspirin-sensitive” and control patients to address this issue. Bronchi from wild-type mice contained predominantly COX-1 immunoreactivity and contracted in vitro in response to acetylcholine and U46619. Bronchi from COX-1−/− mice were hyperresponsive to bronchoconstrictors. Inhibitors of COX (naproxen, diclofenac, or ibuprofen) increased bronchoconstriction in tissue from wild-type but not from COX-1−/− mice. Cells cultured from aspirin-sensitive or control human donors contained similar levels of COX-1 and COX-2 immunoreactivity. COX activity in cells from aspirin-sensitive or tolerant patients was inhibited by aspirin, SC560, which blocks COX-1 selectively, but not by rofecoxib, which is a selective inhibitor of COX-2. These observations show that despite the presence of COX-2, COX-1 is functionally predominant in the airways and explains clinical observations relating to drug specificity in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma.— Harrington, L. S., Lucas, R., McMaster, S. K., Moreno, L., Scadding, G., Warner, T. D., Mitchell, J. A. COX-1, and not COX-2 activity, regulates airway function: relevance to aspirin-sensitive asthma.

https://openalex.org/W2128659575,"Haem is a prosthetic group for haem proteins, which play an essential role in oxygen transport, respiration, signal transduction, and detoxification. In haem biosynthesis, the haem precursor protoporphyrin IX (PP IX) must be accumulated into the mitochondrial matrix across the inner membrane, but its mechanism is largely unclear. Here we show that adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), the inner membrane transporter, contributes to haem biosynthesis by facilitating mitochondrial accumulation of its precursors. We identified that haem and PP IX specifically bind to ANT. Mitochondrial uptake of PP IX was inhibited by ADP, a known substrate of ANT. Conversely, ADP uptake into mitochondria was competitively inhibited by haem and its precursors, suggesting that haem-related porphyrins are accumulated into mitochondria via ANT. Furthermore, disruption of the ANT genes in yeast resulted in a reduction of haem biosynthesis by blocking the translocation of haem precursors into the matrix. Our results represent a new model that ANT plays a crucial role in haem biosynthesis by facilitating accumulation of its precursors into the mitochondrial matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1985695984,"Activation of TRPC3 channels is concurrent with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptor (IP(3)R)-mediated intracellular Ca(2+) release and associated with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis and recruitment to the plasma membrane. Here we report that interaction of TRPC3 with receptor for activated C-kinase-1 (RACK1) not only determines plasma membrane localization of the channel but also the interaction of IP(3)R with RACK1 and IP(3)-dependent intracellular Ca(2+) release. We show that TRPC3 interacts with RACK1 via N-terminal residues Glu-232, Asp-233, Glu-240, and Glu-244. Carbachol (CCh) stimulation of HEK293 cells expressing wild type TRPC3 induced recruitment of a ternary TRPC3-RACK1-IP(3)R complex and increased surface expression of TRPC3 and Ca(2+) entry. Mutation of the putative RACK1 binding sequence in TRPC3 disrupted plasma membrane localization of the channel. CCh-stimulated recruitment of TRPC3-RACK1-IP(3)R complex as well as increased surface expression of TRPC3 and receptor-operated Ca(2+) entry were also attenuated. Importantly, CCh-induced intracellular Ca(2+) release was significantly reduced as was RACK1-IP(3)R association without any change in thapsigargin-stimulated Ca(2+) release and entry. Knockdown of endogenous TRPC3 also decreased RACK1-IP(3)R association and decreased CCh-stimulated Ca(2+) entry. Furthermore, an oscillatory pattern of CCh-stimulated intracellular Ca(2+) release was seen in these cells compared with the more sustained pattern seen in control cells. Similar oscillatory pattern of Ca(2+) release was seen after CCh stimulation of cells expressing the TRPC3 mutant. Together these data demonstrate a novel role for TRPC3 in regulation of IP(3)R function. We suggest TRPC3 controls agonist-stimulated intracellular Ca(2+) release by mediating interaction between IP(3)R and RACK1."
https://openalex.org/W2022093379,"Adaptor protein interaction with specific peptide motifs found within the intracellular, carboxyl terminus of chemokine receptor CXCR2 has been shown to modulate intracellular trafficking and receptor function. Efficient ligand-induced internalization of this receptor is dependent on the binding of adaptor protein 2 to the specific LLKIL motif found within the carboxyl terminus (1Fan G.H. Yang W. Wang X.J. Qian Q. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this study we show that the carboxyl-terminal type 1 PDZ ligand motif (-STTL) of CXCR2 plays an essential role in both proper intracellular receptor trafficking and efficient cellular chemotaxis. First, we show that CXCR2 is sorted to and degraded in the lysosome upon long-term ligand stimulation. We also show that receptor degradation is not dependent upon receptor ubiquitination, but is instead modulated by the carboxyl-terminal type I PDZ ligand of CXCR2. Deletion of this ligand results in increased degradation, earlier co-localization with the lysosome, and enhanced sorting to the Rab7-positive late endosome. We also show that deletion of this ligand effects neither receptor internalization nor receptor recycling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that deletion of the PDZ ligand motif results in impaired chemotactic response. The data presented here demonstrate that the type I PDZ ligand of CXCR2 acts to both delay lysosomal sorting and facilitate proper chemotactic response. Adaptor protein interaction with specific peptide motifs found within the intracellular, carboxyl terminus of chemokine receptor CXCR2 has been shown to modulate intracellular trafficking and receptor function.

The data presented here demonstrate that the type I PDZ ligand of CXCR2 acts to both delay lysosomal sorting and facilitate proper chemotactic response. The chemokine receptor CXCR2 is a seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; LAMP, lysosomal-associated membrane protein; Hrs, hepatocyte receptor substrate; Vps4, vacuolar protein sorter protein 4; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HEK, human embryonic kidney; WT, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein. that plays an important role in many diverse physiological processes such as leukocyte chemotaxis, wound healing, angiogenesis, and inflammation (see Ref. 2Raman D. Baugher P.J. Thu Y.M. Richmond A. Cancer Lett. 2007; 256: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar for review). Conversely, CXCR2 disregulation has been linked to several pathologies, including chronic inflammation responses, metastatic progression, and aberrant angiogenesis during tumor progression (see Ref. 3Strieter R.M. Burdick M.D. Mestas J. Gomperts B. Keane M.P. Belperio J.A. Eur. J. Cancer. 2006; 42: 768-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar for review). However, the molecular mechanisms regulating the activation, signaling, desensitization, and resensitization of this receptor remain poorly characterized. Upon ligand engagement of CXCR2, two interrelated processes occur: a conformational change that initiates several signal transduction cascades linked to cell motility and proliferation, and a phosphorylation event that facilitates the binding of adaptor proteins essential for receptor endocytosis and subsequent intracellular trafficking (see Ref. 4Neel N.F. Schutyser E. Sai J. Fan G.H. Richmond A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 637-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar for review). Like many GPCRs, CXCR2 undergoes clathrin-mediated endocytosis subsequent to agonist-induced activation by its cognate ligands that include CXCL1–3 and 5–8 (5Lee J. Horuk R. Rice G.C. Bennett G.L. Camerato T. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16283-16287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Loetscher P. Seitz M. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20545-20550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). This endocytic event initiates intracellular trafficking of the receptor that results in either a re-localization of the receptor on the plasma membrane, or a down-regulation and degradation of internalized receptor (8Fan G.H. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. Richmond A. Blood. 2003; 101: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Intracellular trafficking plays an essential role in the regulation of signaling and reactivation, and thereby represents a mechanism that regulates proper cellular response. The interruption of this process can result in the disregulation of both signaling and functional outcomes. Subsequent to interaction with endogenous concentrations of ligand, most of the internalized CXCR2 receptors enter the Rab11a-positive recycling endosome and are then shuttled back to the plasma membrane where they become functional for a new round of signaling (4Neel N.F. Schutyser E. Sai J. Fan G.H. Richmond A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 637-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The small GTPase Rab11a is essential for CXCR2 recycling (8Fan G.H. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. Richmond A. Blood. 2003; 101: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), but little else is known regarding the molecular mechanisms governing this process. Initial evidence suggested that the recycling of some membrane receptors, including the transferrin receptor, occurred by bulk flow (9Gruenberg J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). However, this “default” pathway does not appear to be the case for other receptors. The β2-adrenergic receptor was recently shown to possess a “recycling sequence” in its carboxyl-terminal portion that binds to a specific protein and directs the receptor to the recycling pathway (10Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this sequence is a type I PDZ ligand that interacts with the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor/ezrin/radixin/moesin-binding phosphoprotein of 50 kDa (NHERF/EBP50), a PDZ-domain containing protein (10Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Subsequently, several studies have reported the carboxyl-terminal domains of GPCRs to contain “sorting sequences” that presumably interact with specific adaptor proteins and direct the receptor to its fate (11Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 89: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Upon ligand stimulation, most internalized GPCRs are either fated for recycling or for degradation (12Hanyaloglu A.C. von Zastrow M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2007; 48: 537-568Crossref Scopus (469) Google Scholar). CXCR2 undergoes a “sorting decision” in which receptor fate is decided subsequent to internalization. Exposure to either high concentrations of ligand or long-term stimulation appears to shuttle CXCR2 to the lysosome and away from the recycling pathway (8Fan G.H. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. Richmond A. Blood. 2003; 101: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The lysosomal shuttling of GPCRs is thought to be sequence directed, requiring a monoubiquitination event followed by the binding and release of the receptor by several multiprotein complexes (13Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 14Babst M. Sato T.K. Banta L.M. Emr S.D.

However, the molecular mechanisms that direct CXCR2 to the lysosome are largely unknown. To identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for lysosomal shuttling of CXCR2, we first analyzed the degradation of CXCR2 mutants in which the lysine residues of the intracellular, carboxyl-terminal domain had been mutated to arginine. In addition, we examined the effect of carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants of CXCR2 on receptor degradation. Our data show that ubiquitination of CXCR2 is not essential to receptor degradation. Instead, we show that the carboxyl-terminal PDZ ligand binding motif of CXCR2 is an important regulator of this process. Our data demonstrate that this ligand binding motif regulates CXCR2 degradation by modulating the post-endocytic sorting of this receptor. Truncation of the PDZ ligand binding motif of CXCR2 increases ligand-mediated receptor degradation and facilitates early co-localization with the lysosome, without interrupting receptor internalization or recycling. We also show that truncation of the C-terminal PDZ ligand results in interrupted chemotaxis. Taken together, our findings define a new role for the GPCR carboxyl-terminal PDZ ligand binding motif and highlight the importance of the relationship between proper receptor trafficking and functional outcomes. Eukaryotic Expression Constructs—The pRc/CMV CXCR2, pRc/CMV 352T, and pRc/CMV 331T vectors have been previously described (21Mueller S.G. White J.R. Schraw W.P. Lam V. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8207-8214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The EGFP-Rab7 vector was a kind gift from Dr. James R. Goldenring (Department of Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) stably expressing CXCR2, CXCR2 331T, or CXCR2 352T were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine (0.3 mg/ml), and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transient transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cells were assayed 36–48 h post transfection. HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR2 constructs were generated by FuGENE transfection of pRc/CMV CXCR2 vectors followed by 2 weeks of stable selection in 1 mg/ml G418. Stable cells were then sorted according to receptor surface expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using a CXCR2 antibody conjugated directly to phycoerythrin (R&D Technologies, North Kingstown, RI). Western Blotting—Immunoblotting to detect total cellular levels of proteins was performed as previously described (22Neel N.F. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. Richmond A. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were pre-treated for 30 min with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) to inhibit new protein synthesis before stimulation for various times with CXCL8 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). Cells were then washed in ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in extraction buffer (0.05% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1× each protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma), in 1× TBS). Extracts were then clarified by centrifugation and mixed with Laemmli sample buffer for denaturation. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked, and probed for either CXCR2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by immunoblotting using infrared-conjugated secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse (gαm) IgG 680 or goat anti-rabbit (gαr) IgG 700 (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA) and the Odyssey Detection System (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Blots were processed and quantitated with Licor Odyssey Software (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Lysosomal/Proteosomal Inhibitor Studies—Cells were pretreated for 30 min with either 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 nm NH4Cl, or 200 μm chloroquine (Sigma) before stimulation with CXCL8. Cells were lysed and analyzed for CXCR2 expression by Western blotting as described above. Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Imaging—Visualization of CXCR2 receptors, LAMP3, and Rab11a was performed using indirect immunofluorescence staining. Briefly, cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and starved prior to stimulation with CXCL8 for the indicated times. Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, blocked, and incubated with mouse anti-CXCR2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or, rabbit anti-CXCR2 antibody (generated in our laboratory and previously characterized in Ref. 23Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1973-1980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mouse anti-LAMP3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or rabbit-anti Rab11a (kind gift of Dr. James R. Goldenring, previously characterized in Ref. 24Lapierre L.A. Avant K.M. Caldwell C.M. Ham A.J. Hill S. Williams J.A. Smolka A.J. Goldenring J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: G1249-G1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed and incubated with goat anti-mouse Cy3 or goat anti-rabbit Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), washed again, and mounted with Anti-fade Gold (Invitrogen). Lysotracker Red was used to visualize the lysosomes according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes). Briefly, cells were treated with 75 nm Lyostracker Red 2 h prior to fixation. Specimens were examined using a Zeiss LSM5120 Meta Confocal Laser microscope with an oil immersion ×63/NA1.3 objective, using instrument settings verified to produce negligible bleedthrough between channels and an estimated section thickness of 1 μm. Micrographs shown are representative optical sections imaged through the center of the cell. Images were obtained and processed with LSM Imaging Software. Co-localization of CXCR2 with endosomal markers was quantified using the Metamorph Imaging System software package (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Threshold levels for all images were kept consistent among vector and mutant expressing cells. At least 20 fields were quantified for each time point. The percent co-localization is indicative of the area of CXCR2-stained fluorescent pixels overlapping that of endocytic markers. Site-directed Mutagenesis—All lysine residues in the intracellular, carboxyl-terminal domain of wild-type cxcr2 were sequentially mutated to arginine residues by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, primers containing point mutations were designed to the COOH terminus of CXCR2 in pRc/CMV. Subsequent to PCR amplification with a high fidelity Taq polymerase, methylated parental DNA was digested with restriction enzyme DpnI. DNA was then transformed into XL1-Blue Escherichia coli, plated on LB-agar plates containing ampicillin, and prepared for transfection. Radioligand Binding Receptor Internalization Studies—Radioligand binding internalization assays were performed as previously described (1Fan G.H. Yang W. Wang X.J. Qian Q. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were serum-starved overnight and then preincubated with binding buffer containing 125I-CXCL8 for 1 h at 4 °C. Unbound 125I-CXCL8 was removed and the cells were warmed to 37 °C for the indicated times. Internalized 125I-CXCL8 was quantified with a γ-counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Background binding was determined by acidic washing without warming to 37 °C. Receptor Recycling Studies and Plasma Membrane Receptor Expression—Receptor recycling studies were performed as previously described (8Fan G.H. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. Richmond A. Blood. 2003; 101: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), with minor modification. Briefly, cells were serum-starved for 2 h in serum-free media containing 20 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cells were then stimulated with 100 ng/ml CXCL8 for 30 min. Subsequent to stimulation, ligand was removed, and cells were allowed to recover in complete media containing 20 μg/ml cycloheximide for 0, 30, 60, or 90 min. Both unstimulated and stimulated cells were then incubated with anti-CXCR2 antibody directly conjugated to phycoerythrin for 1 h at 4 °C and surface receptor expression was analyzed by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter). Plasma membrane receptor expression was performed similarly. Briefly, cells were serum-starved for 2 h in serum-free media. Cells were then incubated with anti-CXCR2 antibody directly conjugated to phycoerythrin for 1 h at 4 °C and surface receptor expression was analyzed by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter). Chemotaxis Assays—Chemotaxis assays were previously described in Ref. 25Fan G.H. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. Sai J. Richmond A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2456-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar. Briefly, the Boyden chamber membranes (10 μm pore size, Neuroprobe, Gaithersburg, MD) were coated with 10 μg/ml collagen IV (Sigma). The Boyden chamber was then prepared with increasing concentrations of CXCL8 in the lower chambers. Cells stably expressing CXCR2 were trypsinized, recovered in complete media for 2 h, resuspended in binding buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium), and applied to the top of the Boyden chamber. Cells were allowed to migrate for 4 h, then fixed and stained with crystal violet. Those cells migrating to the underside of the membrane were counted under a ×20 objective in an upright light microscope (Nikon), and 20 random fields were counted per treatment. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined by a non-parametric analysis of variance followed by a post hoc Dunn's test, a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, or a Student's t test, as indicated. Chemokine Receptor CXCR2 Is Degraded in the Lysosome—Previous studies have shown that upon ligand stimulation, CXCR2 is endocytosed via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and intracellularly trafficked through endosomal compartments (8Fan G.H. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. Richmond A. Blood. 2003; 101: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 26Yang W. Wang D. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11328-11333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This intracellular trafficking can result in either entry into the recycling endosome and subsequent re-appearance on the plasma membrane where it can continue to receive and transmit signals, or it can result in shuttling to the lysosome where the receptor is degraded and permanently silenced. Previously, we observed that upon ligand stimulation CXCR2 co-localized with recycling endosome marker Rab11a at 30 min post-stimulation, and co-localized with late endosomal marker Rab7-GFP and the lysosomal marker LAMP-1 at 4 h post-stimulation (8Fan G.H. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. Richmond A. Blood. 2003; 101: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These results suggested that upon prolonged ligand stimulation with a high concentration of ligand, CXCR2 is shuttled to the lysosome via the endosomal pathway where it is subsequently degraded. To confirm these findings, we first used a series of lysosomal inhibitors to block total CXCR2 degradation. HEK293 cells stably expressing wild-type CXCR2 receptor, treated first with vehicle alone and then stimulated with CXCL8, exhibited a 35–45% degradation of receptor (Fig. 1, A and B). Upon stimulation, CXCR2 undergoes a mass shift due to differential phosphorylation of the serine residues found within the carboxyl terminus of the receptor (21Mueller S.G. White J.R. Schraw W.P. Lam V. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8207-8214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Those cells treated first with specific lysosomal inhibitor and then stimulated with CXCL8 exhibited 0–10% degradation of receptor, significantly less degradation than was observed with vehicle alone (Fig. 1, A and B). Consistent with these results, confocal analysis of CXCL8-stimulated cells revealed co-localization between CXCR2 and the lysosomal marker lysosomal-associated membrane protein 3 (LAMP-3) (Fig. 1C). Neither the Lysosomal Shuttling nor Degradation of CXCR2 Is Dependent Upon Ubiquitination—Previous studies have shown that many transmembrane receptors, including both single transmembrane growth factor receptors as well as heptathelical G protein-coupled receptors, must be monoubiquitinated on one or more lysine residues located within the intracellular, carboxyl terminus to be shuttled to the lysosome (27Urbe S. Essays Biochem. 2005; 41: 81-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This monoubiquitination event results in molecular recognition by the lysosomal shuttling machinery, and targets specific receptors for degradation (28Mukhopadhyay D. Riezman H. Science. 2007; 315: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). To determine whether ubiquitination was indeed a necessary signal for the lysosomal shuttling of CXCR2, we first identified the lysine residues found within the intracellular, carboxyl terminus (Fig. 2A). We then progressively mutated all 4 lysine residues found within the carboxyl terminus to arginine residues with successive rounds of site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 2A). Subsequent to expression of mutant CXCR2 receptors in HEK293 cells, we found that those receptors mutant for either 3 or 4 lysine residues were degraded upon prolonged ligand stimulation (Fig. 2, B and C). Furthermore, it was noted that the degradation of either CXCR2 3KR or CXCR2 4KR did not differ significantly from that of wild-type CXCR2 (Fig. 2C). We also confirm that the mutant receptors CXCR2 3KR and CXCR2 4KR were both expressed on the surface of HEK293 cells subsequent to transfection, and internalized upon stimulation with CXCL8 (Fig. 2D). In addition, we expressed hemagglutinin-ubiquitin in HEK293 cells stably expressing wild-type CXCR2 and were unable to detect any hemagglutinin-ubiquitin in CXCR2 immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that ubiquitination is not necessary for the lysosomal shuttling of CXCR2. Carboxyl-terminal Truncation of CXCR2 Results in Increased Receptor Degradation and Earlier Co-localization with the Lysosome—The intracellular, carboxyl-terminal domains of GPCRs have been shown to bind to a myriad of adaptor proteins, and regulate such diverse processes as signaling and receptor trafficking (29Wolfe B.L. Trejo J. Traffic. 2007; 8: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 30Moore C.A. Milano S.K. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1469-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Adaptor protein binding of the carboxyl-terminal domain of CXCR2 in particular has been shown to regulate ligand-mediated endocytosis, receptor recycling, and cell-surface expression (1Fan G.H. Yang W. Wang X.J. Qian Q. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 33Barlic J. Khandaker M.H. Mahon E. Andrews J. DeVries M.E. Mitchell G.B. Rahimpour R.

Immunol. 2003; 170: 2904-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to use progressive carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants to decipher the contribution of specific protein motifs to receptor degradation (Fig. 3A). The four amino acid residues distal to residue 352 (-STTL) encode a putative PDZ ligand (20Marchese A. Paing M.M. Temple B.R. Trejo J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2008; 48: 601-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The only PDZ domain-containing protein shown to bind to the carboxyl terminus of CXCR2 is RGS12 (35Snow B.E. Betts L. Mangion J. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6489-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, the functional consequences of this putative PDZ interaction with CXCR2 are unknown. The portion of CXCR2 that is located distal to amino acid residue 331 contains several serine residues that are phosphorylated upon ligand stimulation (1Fan G.H. Yang W. Wang X.J. Qian Q. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated CXCR2 is desensitized to subsequent ligand challenge, and phosphorylated receptor stably associates with adaptor protein β-arrestin, resulting in enhanced endocytosis (1Fan G.H. Yang W. Wang X.J. Qian Q. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We demonstrated here that upon ligand stimulation, both the CXCR2 331T and CXCR2 352T truncated receptors exhibited significantly enhanced degradation compared with that of the wild-type control (Fig. 3, B and C). We also found that degradation of the PDZ ligand deletion mutant increased over that of CXCR2 331T (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, we found that upon CXCL8 stimulation, the absence of the COOH-terminal PDZ ligand motif resulted in earlier co-localization with the lysosome (Fig. 3D). Using Lysotracker red as a lysosomal marker, we showed that at 6 h post-CXCL8 stimulation, both wild-type receptor and the CXCR2 352T mutant co-localized with the lysosome (Fig. 3D, lower panels). At 2 h post-CXCL8 stimulation, CXCR2 352T co-localized extensively with the lysosome while the wild-type receptor did not (Fig. 3DM, middle panels). Not surprisingly, there was little co-localization of either receptor with the lysosome prior to ligand stimulation (Fig. 3D, upper panels). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the presence of the COOH-terminal PDZ ligand motif slows both receptor degradation as well as co-localization with the lysosome. COOH-terminal PDZ Ligand Deletion Has No Effect on Either Receptor Internalization or Receptor Recycling—PDZ domain containing proteins have been shown to act as scaffolds that anchor receptors to the plasma membrane and affect receptor expression (36Brone B. Eggermont J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C20-C29Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 37Kim E. Sheng M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 38Jelen F. Oleksy A. Smietana K. Otlewski J. Acta Biochim.

Studies have demonstrated that knockdown of specific PDZ domain containing proteins results in increased internalization of receptors subsequent to ligand stimulation (40Wang B. Bisello A. Yang Y. Romero G.G. Friedman P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36214-36222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 41Hryciw D.H. Ekberg J. Ferguson C. Lee A. Wang D. Parton R.G.

Because an increased rate of internalization of the CXCR2 352T mutant could explain the increased degradation and earlier lysosome co-localization as compared with the wild-type receptor, we examined internalization rates of the mutant and the wild-type receptor. We showed that upon stimulation with ligand for 1, 5, 10, or 20 min, there was no significant difference in receptor internalization (Fig. 4A). For certain GPCRs, it has been shown that increasing lysosomal shuttling and degradation inevitably decreases receptor recycling, and vice versa (42Babst M. Odorizzi G. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D.

https://openalex.org/W1987438247,"Acquisition of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance by many clinically important bacteria can be traced to horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between related or evolutionarily distant microflora. Comparative genomic analysis has become an important tool for identifying HGT DNA in emerging pathogens. We have adapted the multi-genome alignment tool EvoPrinter to facilitate discovery of HGT DNA sequences within bacterial genomes and within their mobile genetic elements.EvoPrinter analysis of 13 different Staphylococcus aureus genomes revealed that one of the human isolates, the hospital epidemic methicillin-resistant MRSA252 strain, uniquely shares multiple putative HGT DNA sequences with different causative agents of bovine mastitis that are not found in the other human S. aureus isolates. MRSA252 shares over 14 different DNA sequence blocks with the bovine mastitis ET3 S. aureus strain RF122, and many of the HGT DNAs encode virulence factors. EvoPrinter analysis of the MRSA252 chromosome also uncovered virulence-factor encoding HGT events with the genome of Listeria monocytogenes and a Staphylococcus saprophyticus associated plasmid. Both bacteria are also causal agents of contagious bovine mastitis.EvoPrinter analysis reveals that the human MRSA252 strain uniquely shares multiple DNA sequence blocks with different causative agents of bovine mastitis, suggesting that HGT events may be occurring between these pathogens. These findings have important implications with regard to animal husbandry practices that inadvertently enhance the contact of human and livestock bacterial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2073022424,"S100A6 is induced in myocardium post-infarction in vivo and in response to growth factors and inflammatory cytokines in vitro. Forced expression of S100A6 in cardiomyocytes inhibits regulation of cardiac specific gene expression in response to trophic stimulation. To define regulation and function of S100A6, we characterized the human S100A6 promoter and mapped upstream regulatory elements in rat neonatal cardiac myocytes, fibroblasts, and vascular smooth muscle cells and defined a functional role for S100A6 in tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced myocyte apoptosis. The functional S100A6 promoter was localized to region -167/+134 containing 167 upstream base pairs. The S100A6 promoter is regulated by positive (-361/-167 and -588/-361) and negative (-1371/-1194) elements. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced the maximal S100A6 promoter and transcription factor NF-kappaB (p65 subunit). Electrophoretic mobility shift showed that tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced p65 binding to a potential NF-kappaB-binding site at -460/-451. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed p65 is recruited to the S100A6 promoter upon tumor necrosis factor-alpha stimulation. The NF-kappaB inhibitor caffeic acid phenethyl ester and mutation of the NF-kappaB-binding site inhibited S100A6 promoter activation by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced cardiac myocyte apoptosis. Specific inhibition of S100A6 using a small interfering RNA directed against S100A6 potentiated tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced myocyte apoptosis, whereas overexpression of S100A6 by gene transfer prevented tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced myocyte apoptosis by interfering with p53 phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that S100A6 is induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha via an NF-kappaB-dependent mechanism, serving a role in homeostasis to limit tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced apoptosis by regulating p53 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2057174607,"Cytochrome c maturation (Ccm) is a post-translational and post-export protein modification process that involves ten (CcmABCDEFGHI and CcdA or DsbD) components in most Gram-negative bacteria. The absence of any of these components abolishes the ability of cells to form cytochrome c, leading in the case of Rhodobacter capsulatus to the loss of photosynthetic proficiency and respiratory cytochrome oxidase activity. Based on earlier molecular genetic studies, we inferred that R. capsulatus CcmF, CcmH, and CcmI interact with each other to perform heme-apocytochrome c ligation. Here, using functional epitope-tagged derivatives of these components coproduced in appropriate mutant strains, we determined protein-protein interactions between them in detergent-dispersed membranes. Reciprocal affinity purification as well as tandem size exclusion and affinity chromatography analyses provided the first biochemical evidence that CcmF, CcmH, and CcmI associate stably with each other, indicating that these Ccm components form a membrane-integral complex. Under the conditions used, the CcmFHI complex does not contain CcmG, suggesting that the latter thio-reduction component is not always associated with the heme ligation components.

Cytochromes (cyts) 2The abbreviations used are: cyts, cytochromes; Ccm, cyt c maturation; DTB, desthiobiotin; CM, chromatophore membranes. 2The abbreviations used are: cyts, cytochromes; Ccm, cyt c maturation; DTB, desthiobiotin; CM, chromatophore membranes. c are ubiquitous hemoproteins primarily functioning as electron carriers between energy-transducing membrane complexes of photosynthesis (Ps) and respiration (Res). They contain iron-protoporphyrin IX (heme) molecules that are covalently and stereospecifically ligated via thioether bonds formed between the heme vinyl groups and the cysteine thiol groups of Cys1-Xxx-Yyy-Cys2-His (C1XXC2H) motifs within the apocyts c (1Pettigrew G.W. Moore G.R. Cytochromes c, Biological Aspects. Springer Verlag, New York1987Crossref Google Scholar). A complex cyt c maturation (Ccm) pathway is found in α- and γ-proteobacteria, deinococci, and mitochondria of plants and protozoa (Ccm-system I) (2Sanders C. Turkarslan S. Onder O. Frawley E.R. Kranz R.G. Koch H.G. Daldal F. Hunter N.C. Daldal F. Thurnauer C. Beatty J.T. The Purple Phototrophic Bacteria. Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2008: 407-423Google Scholar). In most Gram-negative bacteria, Ccm-system I consists of ten components, CcmABCDEFGHI and CcdA (or DsbD), acting on the outer side of the cytoplasmic membrane (3Turkarslan S. Sanders C. Daldal F. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and ligating heme molecules to apocyts c following their cytoplasmic syntheses. Of the Ccm components, CcmA, CcmB, CcmC, and CcmD form an ATP-binding cassette-containing transporter complex thought to translocate heme across the cytoplasmic membrane, load it to the heme chaperone CcmE, and subsequently release holoCcmE from this complex (4Feissner R.E. Richard-Fogal C.L. Frawley E.R. Kranz R.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). CcdA (or DsbD) together with CcmG are implicated in the reduction of the disulfide bond thought to be formed between the cysteine thiols within apocyt c heme binding motifs by the DsbA-dependent thiooxidative protein-folding pathway (5Collet J.F. Bardwell J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 6Kadokura H. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 111-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). This thio-oxidative pathway is not essential for Ccm per se (7Deshmukh M. Turkarslan S. Astor D. Valkova-Valchanova M. Daldal F. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3361-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 8Erlendsson L.S. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1423-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), although its inactivation reduces Ccm efficiency significantly (39Turkarslan S. Sanders C. Ekici S. Daldal F. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 652-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly though, a defective thio-oxidative branch readily compensates Ccm deficiency in the absence of CcdA and CcmG (7Deshmukh M. Turkarslan S. Astor D. Valkova-Valchanova M. Daldal F. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3361-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Erlendsson L.S. Acheson R.M. Hederstedt L. Le Brun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17852-17858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting that the thio-reduction process during Ccm is only required for cyt c production when a thio-oxidative branch is functional. Moreover, recent data indicate that the compensatory thio-redox interactions involve only CcdA and CcmG, and not CcmH, which is also thought to be part of the apocyt c thio-reduction process (39Turkarslan S. Sanders C. Ekici S. Daldal F. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 652-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). CcmH is comprised of a N-terminal signal peptide, an extra-cytoplasmic loop with a redox-reactive C1XXC2 motif and a C-terminal transmembrane domain (10Fabianek R.A. Hofer T. Thony-Meyer L. Arch.

It has an unusual thioredoxin-like structure (12Di Matteo A. Gianni S. Schinina M.E. Giorgi A. Altieri F. Calosci N. Brunori M. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 7657-7663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Based on genetic studies using Rhodobacter capsulatus, we inferred that CcmH associates not only with CcmF, but also with CcmI (14Sanders C. Deshmukh M. Astor D. Kranz R.G. Daldal F. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4245-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). CcmF is a member of the Heme Handling Protein (HHP) family with multiple transmembrane segments (15Lee J.H. Harvat E.M. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J. Saier Jr., M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 2164-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has a tryptophan-rich (WWD) signature motif and four conserved histidine residues facing the periplasm (16Goldman B.S. Beck D.L. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5003-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and is proposed to ligate heme delivered by CcmE to apocyts c (13Ren Q. Ahuja U. Thony-Meyer L. J. Biol.

Thony-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7657-7663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). CcmI is thought to chaperone the apocyts c to the heme ligation site (17Lang S.E. Jenney Jr., F.E. Daldal F. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5279-5290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In R. capsulatus and many other species, it contains two N-terminal transmembrane helices encompassing a leucine zipper-like motif in its cytoplasmic loop (i.e. CcmI-1) and a large periplasmic C-terminal extension (i.e. CcmI-2) with multiple tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-like motifs (18Blatch G.L. Lassle M. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Recent genetic studies indicated that the CcmI-1 and CcmI-2 domains play distinct roles during Ccm with the former being functionally interconnected with CcmF and CcmH, and the latter with CcmG (14Sanders C. Deshmukh M. Astor D. Kranz R.G. Daldal F. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4245-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 19Sanders C. Boulay C. Daldal F. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this work, using combinations of reciprocal affinity and size exclusion chromatography, we provide the first direct biochemical evidence that R. capsulatus CcmF, CcmH, and CcmI interact with each other to form a stable, multisubunit membrane protein complex. Implications of this CcmFHI-containing heme ligation complex lacking CcmG for the heme-apocyt c ligation process during Ccm are discussed.

Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 3rd edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Sequence analyses and comparisons were conducted using MacVector (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) and BLAST software packages (26Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). Constructions of various epitope-tagged Ccm derivatives were as follows. A Strep-tag sequence was added in-frame to the 5′-end of ccmF in pYZ1 (23Deshmukh M. May M. Zhang Y. Gabbert K.K. Karberg K.A. Kranz R.G. Daldal F. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) via the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the primers CcmF-StrepN-Fwd (5′-GGA GGA CCC CGC ATG ATC AGC TGG AGC CAC CCG CAG TTC GAA AAA GGC GTC GAG ACC GGC CAT-3′) and CcmF-StrepN-Rev (5′-GAA ATC GCC GGT CTC GAC GCC TTT TTC GAA CTG CGG GTG GCT CCA GCT GAT CAT GCG GGG TCC-3′) to create pYZ5. The 2.95-kb XbaI and KpnI-restricted fragment of pYZ5 carrying Strep::ccmF, ccmH and the G488A promoter-up mutation overexpressing the ccmF-ccmH gene cluster (23Deshmukh M. May M. Zhang Y. Gabbert K.K. Karberg K.A. Kranz R.G. Daldal F. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was then cloned into the respective sites of pRK415 to yield pYZ6. Plasmids pST6, pST7, and pST8 were constructed as described in Table 1 (39Turkarslan S. Sanders C. Ekici S. Daldal F. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 652-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The plasmids pCS1581 (ccmH::Strep ccmI::FLAG) and pCS1582 (Strep::ccmF-ccmH ccmI::FLAG) were constructed by cloning the 1.7-kb KpnI fragment of pCS1564 (19Sanders C. Boulay C. Daldal F. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) containing ccmI::FLAG expressed via its own promoter into the unique KpnI site of pST6 and pYZ6, respectively. To construct pCS1718, the R. capsulatus cycAmat, corresponding to the matured form of cyt c2 protein encoded by cycA, was PCR-amplified using pHM14 (27Myllykallio H. Zannoni D. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4348-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as a template and RccycAmat/NdeI-Fwd (5′-CAT ATG GGC GAC GCC GCG AAG GGC GA-3′) and RccycAmat/NdeI-Fwd (5′-GGA TCC TAT TTC ACG ACC GAG GCC AG-3′) as primers. The generated 0.37-kb fragment was phosphorylated and cloned into EcoRV-restricted pBSK. Plasmid pCS1718 was then digested with NdeI and BamHI sites, which were introduced during the PCR amplification from pHM14, and the DNA fragment corresponding to cycAmat cloned into the same sites of pCS1302, a derivative of pCS905 (28Sanders C. Wethkamp N. Lill H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), to yield pCS1726. This plasmid contains an inframe Strep-tag sequence fused at the 5′-end of cycAmat expressed from a Ptac-lac promoter-operator system in E. coli. Detergent-solubilized Membrane Protein Preparation—R. capsulatus cells grown by respiration were resuspended in TNE1 buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm ϵ-amino-caproic acid, and 0.1 mm Pefabloc SC) at a ratio of 5 ml per g cell wet weight, and intracytoplasmic membrane vesicles (chromatophores) prepared using a French pressure cell as described in Ref. 21Daldal F. Cheng S. Applebaum J. Davidson E. Prince R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2012-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar. Chromatophores were homogenized in TNE1 buffer at a protein concentration of 8 mg/ml, solubilized by addition of n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM; Sigma-Aldrich) at a protein:detergent ratio of 1:1 (0.8% w/v DDM) from a 20% (w/v) stock solution under continuous stirring for 1 h at 4 °C, and then centrifuged for 2 h at 4 °C and 120,000 × g to collect solubilized membrane proteins in the supernatants for further use. Various Protein Chromatography—For size exclusion chromatography, solubilized membrane proteins were loaded onto a Sephacryl S-400 HR column (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) pre-equilibrated with five column volumes of TNED1 buffer (TNE1 plus 0.01% (w/v) DDM), which was also used as elution buffer. The flow rate was adjusted to 0.8 ml/min, the absorption of the eluates monitored at 280 nm, and 2.4 ml per fraction were collected. For each Ccm component monitored, proteins present in 400-μl aliquots of desired fractions were precipitated and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunodetection. The size exclusion column was calibrated using blue dextran (2000 kDa), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa) to estimate the molecular mass ranges across the fractions collected. As needed, appropriate high molecular mass fractions were pooled for further analyses. For tag-affinity chromatography, the TNED1 buffer of the solubilized membrane proteins was exchanged with TNED2 (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% (w/v) DDM), to not damage the tag-affinity matrices with high EDTA amounts, using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Protein concentrations were adjusted with the same buffer to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml, and loaded by three successive passages to appropriate affinity columns (StrepTactin®-Sepharose from IBA or ANTI-FLAG®-Agarose from Sigma-Aldrich). For tandem size exclusion and affinity chromatography, high molecular weight fractions separated by the size exclusion column were pooled, the TNED1 buffer was exchanged with TNED2, and proteins were concentrated to 1 mg/ml protein using 10-kDa cut-off Centriplus YM-10 centrifugal filter units (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Affinity columns contained 1-ml matrix volume and were pre-equilibrated with 20 ml of TNED2 buffer. Following sample loading, the respective columns were washed twice with 5 ml of TNED2 buffer, and Strep-tagged (i.e. CcmF and CcmH) or FLAG-tagged (i.e. CcmI) proteins were eluted using 5× matrix volumes (E1-E5 fractions, 1 ml each) with TNED2 buffer containing 5 mm desthiobiotin (DTB) or 0.1 mg/ml FLAG peptide, respectively. For each Ccm component, samples corresponding to 100 μg of total proteins of non-solubilized or DDM dispersed chromatophore membranes, 25 μg of flow-through or column wash solutions, and 5 μg of elution fractions (E2-E5) were precipitated, and analyzed via SDS-PAGE and immunodetection. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bicinchoninic Acid kit from Sigma-Aldrich, and SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses were performed as described below. Production of CcmF Antisera—Antisera generated toward predicted small (∼10 amino acids) soluble antigenic CcmF peptides did not detect CcmF in crude extracts by immunoblotting, even when CcmF was overproduced. Therefore, longer polypeptides (∼several tens of amino acids) from soluble domains were generated and purified for antisera production. The following was determined to give the best results in immunoblots and was used in these studies. The R. capsulatus ccmF gene was used as template for synthesis of a PCR product that encoded the sixth periplasmic domain of R. capsulatus CcmF (P6, as designated in Ref. 16Goldman B.S. Beck D.L. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5003-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was amplified. The forward primer sequence was 5′-GGG CCC ATG GAG GAT ATC CGC GTG GCG AAG, beginning at the amino acid residue 512 of CcmF with the sequence EDIRV (the ATG in the primer encodes the initiating methionine). The reverse primer sequence was 5′-ATC CCA AAG CTT GTT CGC GAA AGG CTT GAC, whereby the amino acid sequence KPFN represents the final residues within the CcmF fragment (ending at residue 609). NcoI and HindIII sites (underlined) were engineered into the forward and revers primers for cloning purposes, respectively. This NcoI and HindIII restricted ccmF fragment cloned into the cytoplasmic expression vector pRSETB (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) produced high yields of an N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged polypeptide of about 20 kDa. Rabbits were immunized either directly with via nickel affinity chromatography purified CcmF-P6 fragment, or after its separation via SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequent electro-elution. The antisera toward the polypeptide (called CcmFP6D) obtained from the latter procedure yielded the best results, and were used in Ref. 23Deshmukh M. May M. Zhang Y. Gabbert K.K. Karberg K.A. Kranz R.G. Daldal F. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, and in this study. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analyses—Proteins were precipitated at –20 °C with 90% (v/v) ice-cold acetone overnight and centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g and 4 °C. The obtained pellets were air-dried and then re-solubilized in SDS loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 25% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue) by incubation at 42 °C for 45 min prior to loading. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Ref. 29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using 15% (T) polyacrylamide gels. Gel-separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA) at 1 mA/cm2 for 2 h using a Trans-Blot SD semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). Membranes were then washed twice for 5 min at room temperature with TBS buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl), saturated with TTBS buffer (TBS + 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature, washed twice for 5 min at room temperature with TTBS buffer, and subsequently probed with rabbit antisera against CcmG (1:5000), CcmH (1:5000), and CcmF (1:1000), or rabbit ANTI-FLAG® polyclonal antibodies (Sigma) (1:2000) for 16 h at 4 °C. Thereafter, membranes were washed three times for 5 min with TTBS buffer and reprobed with either monoclonal anti-rabbit (immunoglobulins clone RG-16) alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich) (1:2000) or stabilized goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugates (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) (each 1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody-antigen complexes were visualized by chromogenic detection using the BCIP/NBT liquid substrate (Sigma-Aldrich) or by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Chemicals—All chemicals were of reagent grade and obtained from commercial sources. Functional Epitope-tagged Derivatives of CcmF, CcmH, and CcmI—For protein-protein interaction studies between CcmF, CcmH, and CcmI, plasmids containing epitope sequence-tagged gene derivatives (Strep::ccmF, ccmH::Strep, and ccmI::FLAG) and appropriate mutant strains were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures” and Table 1. Production of an N-terminally Strep-tagged derivative of CcmF(Strep-CcmF, expressed together with CcmH via a promoter-up mutation variant of the ccmFH cluster) complemented both CcmF-null (MD12) and CcmH-null (MD14) mutants for Ccm, and hence Ps, proficiency. Similarly, a C-terminally Strep-tagged CcmH (CcmH-Strep) and a FLAG-tagged CcmI (CcmI-Flag) derivatives also complemented the CcmH-null (MD14) and CcmI-null (MT-SRP1) mutants for Ps growth, respectively (Table 1) (19Sanders C.

https://openalex.org/W2048144738,"Sexually dimorphic anatomy of brain areas is thought to be causally linked to sex differences in behaviour and cognitive functions. The sex with the regional size advantage (male or female) differs between brain areas and species. Among adult songbirds, males have larger brain areas such as the HVC (proper name) and RA (robust nucleus of the arcopallium) that control the production of learned songs. Forest weavers (Ploceus bicolor) mated pairs sing a unison duet in which male and female mates learn to produce identical songs. We show with histological techniques that the volume and neuron numbers of HVC and RA were > or =1.5 times larger in males than in females despite their identical songs. In contrast, using in-situ hybridizations, females have much higher (30-70%) expression levels of mRNA of a number of synapse-related proteins in HVC and/or RA than their male counterparts. Male-typical and female-typical sexual differentiation appears to act on different aspects of the phenotypes within the same brain areas, leading females and males to produce the same behaviour using different cellular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1999414183,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a short lived secondary messenger, synthesized by nitric-oxide synthases (NOS). It is believed that the activity of inducible NOS (iNOS) is regulated primarily at the transcription level by inducing expression of iNOS mRNA and protein, which then continuously produces NO, until its degradation. Platelets do not have the nuclear transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of the iNOS gene and are believed to generate NO in response to agonist stimulation via endothelial NOS (eNOS). However, here we show that agonist-induced NO production is only partially eNOS-dependent and is also mediated by iNOS. Platelet agonist-induced NO production is significantly reduced in iNOS-knockout platelets. Platelet NO production occurs within seconds after agonist addition and is not accompanied by changes in iNOS protein levels, indicating a signaling-mediated functional activation mechanism of iNOS. Importantly, iNOS knock-out and iNOS inhibitors reduce agonist-induced platelet secretion and aggregation and cGMP levels, indicating that iNOS activation is important in stimulating platelets via the newly identified NO-cGMP-dependent platelet secretion pathway. Furthermore, iNOS knock-out mice have prolonged bleeding time, suggesting that this novel mode of regulation of iNOS activity plays a physiologically relevant role in hemostasis.

Feil R. Hofmann F. Ann. Med. 2003; 35: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is synthesized from l-arginine by the family of enzymes known as nitric-oxide synthases (NOS). There are three isoforms of NOS enzymes: NOS1 (neuronal NOS, nNOS), NOS2 (inducible NOS, iNOS), and NOS3 (endothelial NOS or eNOS) (2Alderton W.K. Cooper C.E. Knowles R.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 593-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (3241) Google Scholar). nNOS and eNOS are constitutively expressed in cells, and the enzymatic activities of eNOS and nNOS are regulated by intracellular Ca2+ levels and protein phosphorylation (3Fleming I. Busse R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: R1-R12PubMed Google Scholar). iNOS is currently described as a Ca2+-independent enzyme that is not normally expressed in resting cells (2Alderton W.K. Cooper C.E. Knowles R.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 593-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (3241) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of several different cell types (such as endothelial cells and macrophages) with various cytokines or bacterial lipopolysaccharide, iNOS transcription is induced, and, within several hours, iNOS protein is expressed. It is believed that once induced to express, iNOS is always active and produces NO until the protein is degraded (4MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3458) Google Scholar, 5Kleinert H. Pautz A. Linker K. Schwarz P.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 500: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Interestingly, constitutive expression of low levels of iNOS has been reported in various tissues, such as kidneys (6Tojo A. Gross S.S. Zhang L. Tisher C.C. Schmidt H.H. Wilcox C.S. Madsen K.M. J. Am Soc. Nephrol. 1994; 4: 1438-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), paranasal sinuses (7Lundberg J.O. Farkas-Szallasi T. Weitzberg E. Rinder J. Lidholm J. Anggaard A. Hokfelt T. Lundberg J.M.

Blood platelets do not have nuclei and thus do not have the ability to regulate protein expression transcriptionally. Upon exposure to subendothelium-bound agonists, such as von Willebrand factor or collagen, or soluble agonists, such as thrombin, thromboxane A2, and ADP, at sites of vascular injury, platelets are rapidly activated to form primary thrombi. Agonist-activated platelets generate NO (10Malinski T. Radomski M.W. Taha Z. Moncada S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 960-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 11Freedman J.E.

We have recently shown that platelet agonists induce activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Akt, which activates eNOS (12Stojanovic A. Marjanovic J.A. Brovkovych V.M. Peng X. Hay N. Skidgel R.A. Du X. J. Biol.

Here, we show that NO synthesis during platelet activation not only involves eNOS, but is also mediated by the constitutively expressed platelet iNOS. Inducible NOS-derived NO is also important in promoting platelet activation, both ex vivo and in vivo, via the cGMP-dependent mechanism. Thus, our data reveal that iNOS can be activated by a physiologically important mechanism that is posttranslational and independent of previously identified transcriptional regulation.

For the preparation of mouse platelets, 8–12-week-old mice of either sex were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital, and blood was drawn from the inferior vena cava (15Li Z. Zhang G. Le Breton G.C. Gao X. Malik A.B. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30725-30731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Blood from five to six mice of either genotype was pooled, and platelets were isolated by differential centrifugation as described (15Li Z. Zhang G. Le Breton G.C. Gao X. Malik A.B. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30725-30731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Platelets were washed two times with CGS buffer (0.12 m sodium chloride, 0.0129 m trisodium citrate, and 0.03 m d-glucose, pH 6.5), resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer, and allowed to rest for at least 1 h at room temperature before use (16Du X.P. Plow E.F. Frelinger A.L. 3rd, O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1991; 65: 409-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Platelet Aggregation and Secretion—Platelet aggregation was measured in a turbidometric platelet aggregometer (Chronolog) at 37 °C with stirring (1,000 rpm). Platelets were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C with various concentrations of inhibitors or corresponding vehicle controls before the addition of platelet agonists. In some experiments, 8-bromo-cGMP was added immediately after the addition of platelet agonist. Platelet secretion was monitored in parallel with platelet aggregation as ATP release in a platelet lumiaggregometer (Chronolog) with the addition of luciferin/luciferase reagent to the platelet suspension. Quantification was performed using the ATP standard. Statistical analysis was performed using a paired t test. NO Measurements—Washed mouse platelets in Tyrode's buffer were stimulated with thrombin under stirring conditions at 37 °C. NO release was measured electrochemically in real time using nafion-coated porphyrinic microsensor, calibrated with standard NO solutions (17Brovkovych V. Stolarczyk E. Oman J. Tomboulian P. Malinski T. J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 1999; 19: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In some experiments, platelets were preincubated with 200 μm puromycin or vehicle control for 10 min. These measurements were done using commercial free radical analyzer Apollo 4000 and nitric oxide sensor ISO-NOPF (World Precision Instruments) calibrated with NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-d,l-penicillamine solutions in 0.1 m copper(II)-sulfate, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical analysis was performed using a t test. Measurement of Platelet cGMP Levels—Washed mouse platelets, resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer, were stimulated with collagen for 5 min in a platelet aggregometer with stirring (1,000 rpm) at 37 °C. Washed human platelets were preincubated with iNOS inhibitors for 5 min or an equal volume of vehicle control at 37 °C before the addition of agonist and incubated in a platelet aggregometer with stirring (1,000 rpm) for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold 12% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, the samples were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was extracted four times with 5 volumes of water-saturated diethyl ether. The samples were lyophilized, and cGMP concentrations were determined using a cGMP enzyme immunoassay kit from Amersham Biosciences-Pharmacia Biotech. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance between groups was determined by a t test. iNOS Detection in Platelets—RNA was isolated from C57 black or iNOS knock-out mouse platelets with the total RNA extraction kit from Promega. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Thermoscript RT-PCR (Invitrogen), following the instructions of the manufacturer. One-tenth of each reaction was used as a cDNA template for the PCR. iNOS cDNA was amplified over 45 cycles with a forward primer 5′-CCAAGGTTGTCTGCATGGA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGTCATGAGCAAAGGCGCA-3′. PCR products (expected size, 220 bp) were separated on 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and visualized under a UV lamp. A control PCR was done from same cDNA preparations using primers specific for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. To exclude the possible contamination from leukocytes, RNA template was isolated from washed leukocytes, and RT-PCR was performed using identical primers and PCR conditions as described for platelets. Isolation of leukocytes was performed as described (18Ulmer A.J. Flad H.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1979; 30: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To detect iNOS protein in mouse platelets, washed platelets (2 × 109 platelets/ml) resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer were solubilized with an equal amount of solubilization buffer (0.1 m Tris, 10 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) containing 0.2 mm E64, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.08 unit/ml aprotinin, 2 mm NaF and incubated on ice for 20 min. After centrifuging for 15 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C, both supernatant and pellets were respectively solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-iNOS monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories). In most experiments, iNOS protein was only detected in the Triton X-100-insoluble pellet. For detection of iNOS protein in human platelets, 4 × 109/ml platelets were solubilized as above. After centrifugation, platelet lysates were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal anti-iNOS antibody or control IgG. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with the rabbit polyclonal anti-iNOS antibody. eNOS Detection in Platelets—Washed platelets resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer were solubilized with 50 mm β-octylglucoside, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm E64, pH 7.4. After centrifugation, the lysates were incubated with 2′,5′-ADP-agarose beads, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with eNOS-specific antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Bleeding Time Analysis—Mice of either sex (10–15 weeks old, 24–30 g) were anesthetized with pentobarbital (100 μg/g). Tails were cut 0.5 cm from the tip and immediately immersed in 0.15 m NaCl at 37 °C. Bleeding was followed visually, and time to stable cessation of bleeding (no rebleeding within 1 min) was recorded. Data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney and log-rank tests. Role of iNOS in Agonist-induced Platelet NO Production—To investigate which NOS isoform is responsible for agonist-induced NO production in platelets, wild-type or eNOS–/– platelets were stimulated with thrombin and analyzed for NO release in real time using an electrochemical detection method. NO production in eNOS–/– platelets was reduced only by approximately 50%, compared with wild-type platelets (Fig. 1). Partial reduction in NO production in eNOS–/– platelets implies the presence of another NOS isoform. This result is consistent with our recent data that eNOS knock-out platelets showed partial reduction in agonist-induced cGMP elevation (13Marjanovic J.A. Li Z. Stojanovic A. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37430-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Previous reports have detected low levels of iNOS, but not neuronal NOS in human platelets (8Chen L.Y. Mehta J.L. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Wallerath T. Gath I. Aulitzky W.E. Pollock J.S. Kleinert H. Forstermann U. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), although its functional state remained unknown. Indeed, we have detected the expression of iNOS mRNA (Fig. 2A) in wild-type but not iNOS–/– mouse platelets by RT-PCR. The PCR amplicon of iNOS mRNA fragment is unlikely to be from contaminating leukocytes in platelet preparation because this specific 220-bp band was not detected in RNA isolated from blood leukocyte preparations containing up to 50 times higher concentration of leukocytes than the concentration of contaminating leukocytes in the platelet preparation (106/ml leukocytes versus 2 × 104/ml leukocytes in platelet preparation) (Fig. 2A). This indicates that the observed iNOS mRNA was derived from platelets. Consistent with the expression of iNOS mRNA in wild-type platelets, we also detected low levels of iNOS protein expression in wild-type but not in iNOS–/– platelets by Western blotting (Fig. 2, C and D). These data suggest that resting mouse platelets constitutively express iNOS. iNOS is also detected in human platelets (Fig. 2E). To investigate whether platelet iNOS is functional, wild-type or iNOS–/– platelets were stimulated with thrombin, and NO production was measured. Platelets from iNOS-knock-out mice showed significantly reduced NO production compared with wild-type platelets (Fig. 3, A and B). Because iNOS-knockout platelets express levels of eNOS comparable with wild-type platelets (Fig. 3C), the reduction in NO production in iNOS-knock-out platelets suggests that agonist stimulation of platelets induces iNOS-dependent NO synthesis. iNOS Activation Does Not Result from Increased iNOS Protein Expression—Agonist-induced NO production in platelets occurs within seconds after thrombin stimulation and peaks at approximately 2–3 min (Figs. 1A and 3A). This type of signal is indicative of transient activation of enzymatic function of already expressed iNOS protein, which, unlike the transcriptional regulation of iNOS, has not been known previously. Platelets do not have a nucleus. Although platelets contain a significant amount of mRNA and have the potential for de novo protein synthesis (19Warshaw A.L. Laster L. Shulman N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2094-2097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kieffer N. Guichard J. Farcet J.P. Vainchenker W. Breton-Gorius J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), significant protein synthesis occurs in response to agonist stimulation only after much longer incubation (21Weyrich A.S. Dixon D.A. Pabla R. Elstad M.R. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5556-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that agonist-stimulated iNOS activity results from de novo iNOS protein synthesis, we have compared the protein expression levels between resting and thrombin-stimulated platelets. Indeed, we show that iNOS protein levels are similar before and after 5 min of agonist stimulation (Fig. 3, D and E), indicating that agonist-stimulated iNOS activation is independent of changes in the levels of iNOS protein expression. As a further support to this conclusion, we also obtained data that preincubation with a protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin under conditions shown previously to abolish protein translation (22Seiser R.M. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33820-33827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Roy A. Wonderlin W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4397-4403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) did not affect the thrombin-induced NO production in wild-type or eNOS knock-out platelets (data not shown). Consistent with these results, we have also obtained data that there is no significant de novo synthesis of Bcl-3, a protein shown to be synthesized after prolonged platelet activation, after 5 min of agonist stimulation of mouse platelets under the same experimental conditions that iNOS-dependent NO synthesis was demonstrated (data not shown). Thus, it appears that agonist-induced NO production does not involve increased iNOS protein levels. Consequently, these results indicate that platelet iNOS is activated by a platelet agonist-induced signaling mechanism that regulates the enzymatic function of constitutively expressed iNOS protein. Role of iNOS in Platelet Activation and Hemostasis—To determine whether agonist-induced activation of iNOS is important in regulating platelet activation, platelets from wild-type or iNOS-deficient mice were stimulated with low concentrations of thrombin and assayed for platelet aggregation (Fig. 4A). iNOS–/– platelets showed significantly inhibited aggregation response, indicating that iNOS plays an important role in platelet activation. The inhibitory effect of iNOS knock-out is characteristic of a defect in platelet secretion. To determine whether iNOS knockout affects platelet secretion, ATP release was measured concomitantly with platelet aggregation. Low dose thrombin-induced platelet secretion was inhibited significantly in iNOS–/– platelets (Fig. 4A). To determine whether iNOS activation also plays a role in platelet activation induced by other platelet agonists, wild-type or iNOS-deficient platelets were stimulated with a low dose of collagen. Similar to thrombin-stimulated platelets, iNOS–/– platelets showed decreased collagen-induced secretion and aggregation response (Fig. 4B). Thus, iNOS participates in mouse platelet activation induced by different platelet agonists. The defect in platelet aggregation of iNOS knock-out platelets could be overcome at higher agonist concentrations (Fig. 4, C and D). This is not unexpected because eNOS also mediates agonist induced NO production and contributes to platelet activation (13Marjanovic J.A. Li Z. Stojanovic A. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37430-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To test the effect of iNOS knock-out on hemostasis in vivo, we have determined bleeding time in a standard tail bleeding assay in mice. Consistent with the data from ex vivo studies, we found that iNOS knock-out mice had significantly prolonged bleeding time compared with wild-type controls. Median bleeding time for iNOS–/– mice was 208 s, whereas wild-type mice had a median bleeding time of 115.5 s, p < 0.05 (Mann-Whitney test). The effect of iNOS knock-out on bleeding time was also significant by a log rank test (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5). Taken together, the studies on iNOS knock-out suggest that the described posttranslational activation of iNOS occurs under physiological conditions and plays an important role in platelet activation and hemostasis. Human platelets also express low levels of iNOS protein (8Chen L.Y. Mehta J.L. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Wallerath T. Gath I. Aulitzky W.E. Pollock J.S. Kleinert H. Forstermann U. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D). To investigate the role of iNOS in human platelet activation, washed human platelets were preincubated with iNOS-specific inhibitors 1400W (24Garvey E.P. Oplinger J.A. Furfine E.S. Kiff R.J. Laszlo F. Whittle B.J. Knowles R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4959-4963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) or aminoguanidine (25Griffiths M.J. Messent M. MacAllister R.J. Evans T.W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and stimulated with a low concentration of agonists. Both agents inhibited platelet secretion and the second wave of platelet aggregation induced by low dose thrombin (Fig. 6A). These iNOS inhibitors also reduced collagen-stimulated human platelet secretion and aggregation (Fig. 6B). The inhibitory effects of both inhibitors are dose-dependent, with marked inhibition already observed at 25 μm (supplemental Fig. 1). It has been reported that aminoguanidine is 10 times more selective for iNOS over eNOS with an IC50 of 330 μm for eNOS, whereas 1400W exhibits higher than 4,000-fold selectivity for iNOS over eNOS and an IC50 of 1,000 μm for eNOS (2Alderton W.K. Cooper C.E. Knowles R.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 593-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (3241) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that 300 μm 1400W had only a slight effect on eNOS activity in a tissue-based activity assay (24Garvey E.P. Oplinger J.A. Furfine E.S. Kiff R.J. Laszlo F. Whittle B.J. Knowles R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4959-4963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Therefore, although we do not exclude very limited effects of these inhibitors on NO production generated by other enzymes, it is likely that the inhibitory actions of these agents result predominantly from iNOS inhibition. Thus, iNOS-mediated NO production plays an important role in low dose agonist-induced human platelet secretion and the secretion-dependent second wave of platelet aggregation. iNOS Promotes Platelet Activation in a cGMP-dependent Manner—NO regulates cellular functions by cGMP-dependent and -independent signaling pathways. In the cGMP-dependent pathway, agonist-stimulated NO activates soluble guanylyl cyclase and induces cGMP synthesis, which then further activates the cGMP-dependent protein kinase. To investigate the role of iNOS in cGMP production, we examined the effect of iNOS knock-out or iNOS inhibitors on collagen-induced cGMP production. Consistent with previous studies, collagen induced cGMP elevation (26Haslam R.J. McClenaghan M.D. Biochem. J. 1974; 138: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Collagen-induced cGMP elevation was significantly inhibited by iNOS-knock-out (Fig. 7A) or iNOS inhibitors (Fig. 7B), suggesting that NO produced by the agonist-activated iNOS plays an important role in agonist-stimulated cGMP elevation. Inhibition of cGMP production by iNOS knock-out was partial, which is consistent with our previous results that eNOS also plays a role in agonist-induced platelet NO production and cGMP elevation (13Marjanovic J.A. Li Z. Stojanovic A. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37430-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, both eNOS and iNOS are important in stimulating the cGMP-dependent signaling pathway, which explains why the respective knockouts show relatively mild defects in platelet activation. To determine whether the role of agonist-induced iNOS activation in stimulating platelet activation is mediated via the cGMP-dependent signaling pathway, we investigated whether a membrane-permeable cGMP analog could reverse the inhibitory effect of the iNOS inhibitor 1400W on platelet activation. Low concentrations of cell-permeable 8-bromo-cGMP reversed the inhibitory effect of the iNOS inhibitor on platelet aggregation and secretion (Fig. 7C). Therefore, agonist-induced iNOS activation is upstream of the cGMP/protein kinase G pathway, which was recently found to play a stimulatory role in platelet activation (14Li Z. Zhang G. Marjanovic J.A. Ruan C. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42469-42475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Li Z. Xi X. Gu M. Feil R. Ye R.D. Eigenthaler M. Hofmann F. Du X. Cell. 2003; 112: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The data presented in this study demonstrate the novel activation of iNOS protein by intracellular signals. These data also indicate that constitutively expressed low levels of iNOS serve as a “low output” NO production mechanism that is physiologically important in mediating platelet secretion, aggregation, and primary hemostasis. The role of NO in many physiological and pathological processes has been the subject of a great many controversies. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that NO plays biphasic roles both physiologically and pathophysiologically in many cells. Thus, the effects of low concentrations of NO on a physiological or pathological event often contradict the effects of high concentrations of NO. Biphasic roles of NO have been shown in leukocytes and macrophages (28Browning D.D. McShane M.P. Marty C. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2811-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 29Browning D.D. Windes N.D. Ye R.D. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 3873-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Similarly, NO exerts both stimulatory and inhibitory effects during tumor development depending on NO concentrations (31Lechner M. Lirk P. Rieder J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2005; 15: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In heart, liver, and kidney, NO has been shown to be both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic, depending on the amount of synthesized NO and the redox environment (32Razavi H.M. Hamilton J.A. Feng Q. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 106: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 33Vodovotz Y. Kim P.K. Bagci E.Z. Ermentrout G.B. Chow C.C. Bahar I. Billiar T.R. Curr. Mol.

In platelets, it has been known for many years that high concentrations of NO donors (micromolar range) inhibit platelet function (35Mellion B.T. Ignarro L.J. Ohlstein E.H. Pontecorvo E.G. Hyman A.L. Kadowitz P.J. Blood. 1981; 57: 946-955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Jang E.K. Azzam J.E. Dickinson N.T. Davidson M.M. Haslam R.J. Br. J. Haematol. 2002; 117: 664-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, we have shown recently that low concentrations of NO (low nanomolar range) stimulate platelet activation via the cGMP-dependent protein kinase pathway, again indicating a biphasic effect of the NO-cGMP pathway in platelet activation (12Stojanovic A. Marjanovic J.A. Brovkovych V.M. Peng X. Hay N. Skidgel R.A. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16333-16339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 13Marjanovic J.A. Li Z.

Cell. 2003; 112: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 37Li Z. Ajdic J. Eigenthaler M. Du X. Blood. 2003; 101: 4423-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the controversy on the role of NO in platelets has been complicated by the fact that investigators in some studies used platelet preparations that are desensitized and thus no longer responsive to low concentrations of agonists (such as 0.1 unit/ml thrombin) (38Morrell C.N. Matsushita K. Chiles K. Scharpf R.B. Yamakuchi M. Mason R.J. Bergmeier W. Mankowski J.L. Baldwin W.M. 3rd, Faraday N. Lowenstein C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3782-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Studies using desensitized platelets are naturally unable to show the stimulatory effect of NO on platelet activation induced by low concentrations of agonists. Our study is consistent with the biphasic effect of NO in platelets and further shows that low concentrations of NO can be produced by iNOS during platelet activation. Cells regulate NO levels by regulating the activity and expression of different isoforms of NOS. Traditionally, eNOS has been considered to be a low output enzyme that synthesizes low levels of NO, believed to serve the physiological role of a secondary messenger. Conversely, it is believed that iNOS is a high output NOS whose expression is inducible at the transcriptional level and that upon expression, iNOS is always active and synthesizes high levels of NO (4MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3458) Google Scholar, 5Kleinert H. Pautz A. Linker K. Schwarz P.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 500: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Catalytic activity of iNOS is almost 10 times higher than eNOS (39Santolini J. Meade A.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48887-48898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 40Stuehr D.J. Santolini J. Wang Z.Q. Wei C.C. Adak S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36167-36170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown recently that the principal NOS isoform mediating NO overproduction responsible for cardiovascular dysfunction during anaphylactic shock is eNOS rather than iNOS (41Cauwels A. Janssen B. Buys E. Sips P. Brouckaert P. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 2244-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), indicating that isoforms other than iNOS can serve as a high output source of NO. However, constitutive expression of low levels of iNOS has been reported in different tissues, including platelets (8Chen L.Y. Mehta J.L. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Wallerath T. Gath I. Aulitzky W.E. Pollock J.S. Kleinert H. Forstermann U. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but the functions of this constitutively expressed iNOS were previously unknown. Our data clearly show that constitutively expressed iNOS protein in platelets can be activated by agonist-induced intracellular signaling to produce NO and that iNOS appears to contribute to approximately half of the NO produced during platelet activation. The significant contribution of the barely detectable levels of iNOS in platelet NO synthesis is probably because iNOS protein has much higher catalytic efficiency than eNOS protein (40Stuehr D.J. Santolini J. Wang Z.Q. Wei C.C. Adak S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36167-36170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). More importantly, our study uncovers a novel nontranscriptional regulatory mechanism that activates the function of constitutively expressed iNOS. Our data demonstrate that low concentrations of NO derived from platelet iNOS, similar to eNOS-derived NO, activate soluble guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP, which stimulates platelet secretion and thus aggregation. As discussed above, because of the presence of eNOS, the functional defects of iNOS knock-out mice are mild and are only shown when platelets are stimulated with very low concentrations of agonists. However, to our surprise, iNOS knock-out mice showed prolonged bleeding time. NO is a known vessel dilator, and thus the effect of reduced NO production by iNOS knock-out on vascular wall should favor a shortened bleeding time. Thus, our results suggest that NO generated by platelet iNOS may play a stimulatory role in in vivo hemostasis. Interestingly, a previous study showed that when iNOS expression in vascular wall was induced by tumor necrosis factor-α, the high concentrations of NO it produced were associated with a reduction in injury-induced thrombosis in vivo (42Cambien B. Bergmeier W. Saffaripour S. Mitchell H.A. Wagner D.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Our data, when combined with these results, suggest a biphasic role for iNOS in vasculature. Constitutively expressed iNOS can be activated during platelet activation by posttranslational signaling and thus serve as a low output NOS that promotes platelet activation and hemostasis, but high levels of iNOS transcriptionally induced to express in vascular wall cells by cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α during inflammation serve as a high output NOS that is associated with the inhibitory effect on thrombosis (42Cambien B. Bergmeier W. Saffaripour S. Mitchell H.A. Wagner D.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results are not only significant to our understanding of the roles of NO signaling pathway in platelets, but are also of general significance for the following reasons. First, these data for the first time indicate that iNOS can be expressed as a relatively inactive form in cells which becomes activated in response to stimuli. Second, they indicate that there are two different iNOS activation mechanisms: a fast functional activation in which iNOS responds to stimuli immediately without requiring the induction of protein synthesis, and the slow transcriptional regulation that leads to the production of a large quantity of NO. Finally, our data indicate that iNOS can function both as a low output and a high output NOS and can be responsible for the biphasic roles of NO in cellular functions. It would be very interesting to understand further how iNOS function is activated by intracellular signaling. Download .pdf (.02 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2005877544,"Background The genetic basis of postzygotic isolation is a central puzzle in evolutionary biology. Evolutionary forces causing hybrid sterility or inviability act on the responsible genes while they still are polymorphic, thus we have to study these traits as they arise, before isolation is complete. Methodology/Principal Findings Isofemale strains of D. mojavensis vary significantly in their production of sterile F1 sons when females are crossed to D. arizonae males. We took advantage of the intraspecific polymorphism, in a novel design, to perform quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping analyses directly on F1 hybrid male sterility itself. We found that the genetic architecture of the polymorphism for hybrid male sterility (HMS) in the F1 is complex, involving multiple QTL, epistasis, and cytoplasmic effects. Conclusions/Significance The role of extensive intraspecific polymorphism, multiple QTL, and epistatic interactions in HMS in this young species pair shows that HMS is arising as a complex trait in this system. Directional selection alone would be unlikely to maintain polymorphism at multiple loci, thus we hypothesize that directional selection is unlikely to be the only evolutionary force influencing postzygotic isolation."

The single syndecan of invertebrates appears not to have cell adhesion roles, but these have been described for mammalian paralogues, especially syndecan-4. This member is best understood in terms of interactions, signaling, and structure of its cytoplasmic domain. The zebrafish homologue of syndecan-4 has been genetically linked to cell adhesion and migration in zebrafish embryos, but no molecular and cellular studies have been reported. Here it is demonstrated that key functional attributes of syndecan-4 are common to both zebrafish and mammalian homologues. These include glycosaminoglycan substitution, a NXIP motif in the extracellular domain that promotes integrin-mediated cell adhesion, and a transmembrane GXXXG motif that promotes dimer formation. In addition, despite some amino acid substitutions in the cytoplasmic domain, its ability to form twisted clamp dimers is preserved, as revealed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This technique also showed that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate can interact with the zebrafish syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain, and that the molecule in its entirety supports focal adhesion formation, and complements the murine null cells to restore a normal actin cytoskeleton identically to the rat homologue. Therefore, the cell adhesion properties of syndecan-4 are consistent across the vertebrate spectrum and reflect an early acquisition of specialization after syndecan gene duplication events at the invertebrate/early chordate boundary.

https://openalex.org/W2168984113,"Cadmium is a highly toxic environmental contaminant implicated in various diseases. Our previous data demonstrated that Pca1, a P1B-type ATPase, plays a critical role in cadmium resistance in yeast S. cerevisiae by extruding intracellular cadmium. This illustrates the first cadmium-specific efflux pump in eukaryotes. In response to cadmium, yeast cells rapidly enhance expression of Pca1 by a post-transcriptional mechanism. To gain mechanistic insights into the cadmium-dependent control of Pca1 expression, we have characterized the pathway for Pca1 turnover and the mechanism of cadmium sensing that leads to up-regulation of Pca1. Pca1 is a short-lived protein (t½ < 5 min) and is subject to ubiquitination when cells are growing in media lacking cadmium. Distinct from many plasma membrane transporters targeted to the vacuole for degradation via endocytosis, cells defective in this pathway did not stabilize Pca1. Rather, Pca1 turnover was dependent on the proteasome. These data suggest that, in the absence of cadmium, Pca1 is targeted for degradation before reaching the plasma membrane. Mapping of the N terminus of Pca1 identified a metal-responding degradation signal encompassing amino acids 250–350. Fusion of this domain to a stable protein demonstrated that it functions autonomously in a metal-responsive manner. Cadmium sensing by cysteine residues within this domain circumvents ubiquitination and degradation of Pca1. These data reveal a new mechanism for substrate-mediated control of P1B-type ATPase expression.

Although several heavy metals are essential micronutrients, many of them are highly toxic with no physiological role. Genetic disorders in metal metabolism, such as hemochromatosis and Wilson disease, provide striking evidence for the toxicity of nutritional metal ions (1De Domenico I. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. Nat.

For instance, cadmium has a high affinity for sulfhydryl (-SH) groups in proteins and glutathione, a major cellular reducing buffer, which results in inactivation of proteins and oxidative stress (4Jarup L.

Rather, cadmium enters the body through nonspecific mechanisms and/or transporters involved in the acquisition of essential metal ions. DMT1 (DCT1, Nramp2) iron transporter, zinc transporters, and calcium channels are all involved in cadmium absorption (15Bressler J.P. Olivi L. Cheong J.H. Kim Y. Bannona D. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Metallothionein, a cysteine-rich low molecular weight metalchelating peptide, and GSH, a cysteine-containing tripeptide, sequester metal ions. In eukaryotes, this is considered the major mechanism for neutralizing toxic metals, including cadmium (20Klaassen C.D. Liu J. Choudhuri S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Ace1 is a transcription factor inducing expression of copper defense genes in S. cerevisiae (24Zhou P. Thiele D.J. Biofactors. 1993; 4: 105-115PubMed Google Scholar). Ycf1, a vacuolar membrane ATP-binding cassette transporter, sequesters glutathione-conjugated cadmium and other metals into the vacuole (25Li Z.S. Lu Y.P. Zhen R.G. Szczypka M. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Thus, Δace1 and Δycf1 strains are sensitive to copper and cadmium, respectively. Phytochelatin, a GSH polymer synthesized in plants and fission yeast, also chelates heavy metals (21Cobbett C. Goldsbrough P. Annu. Rev. Plant. Biol. 2002; 53: 159-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1885) Google Scholar). Several heavy metal efflux pumps, including P1B-type ATPases, ATP-binding cassette transporters, and cation diffusion facilitators play roles for extruding toxic heavy metals (3Lutsenko S. Barnes N.L. Bartee M.Y. Dmitriev O.Y. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 1011-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 26Silver S. Phung L.T. Annu. Rev.

These metal transporters play vital roles for uptake, compartmentalization, and extrusion of nutritional and nonphysiological heavy metals. In bacterial cells, P1B-type ATPases are vital for extrusion of metals, including cadmium, copper, and lead (26Silver S. Phung L.T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 753-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar, 27Nies D.H. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 51: 730-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). However, the cadmium efflux systems in eukaryotes remain uncharacterized. Transcriptional control appears to be a major regulatory mechanism for regulation of P1B-type ATPases in bacteria and plants (26Silver S. Phung L.T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 753-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar, 27Nies D.H. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 51: 730-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 28Williams L.E.

In mammals copper controls subcellular trafficking of copper-transporting P1B-type ATPases from the trans-Golgi to the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic vesicle-like compartments (3Lutsenko S. Barnes N.L. Bartee M.Y. Dmitriev O.Y. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 1011-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 29Lutsenko S. Petris M.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), which appears to be an important mechanism for excretion of excess copper. In a previous study, we demonstrated that Pca1, a predicted P1B-type metal-transporting ATPase, is critical for cadmium defense in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (30Adle D.J. Sinani D. Kim H. Lee J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 947-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Pca1 is rapidly up-regulated in response to cadmium without any change in its transcript levels (30Adle D.J. Sinani D. Kim H. Lee J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 947-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which suggests a new mode of substrate-mediated regulation for this family of proteins. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the expressional control of Pca1 in response to cadmium, we have characterized the pathways for turnover of Pca1 and identified a metal-sensing cis-acting element that controls turnover of Pca1. Our data demonstrate that a degradation signal within the cysteine-rich N terminus rapidly targets Pca1 for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. This occurs before Pca1 reaches the plasma membrane where it extrudes cadmium. However, direct cadmium sensing by the degradation signal prevents turnover, which leads to enhanced expression of Pca1. Cells have likely evolved this mode of regulation for a rapid and specific response against cadmium. Together, we have identified a new metal-binding domain and revealed a unique mode of regulation for a P1B-type ATPase by its own substrate. Yeast Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—A BY4741 haploid S. cerevisiae strain (MATa his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0) and null mutants, including ace1::KanMX6, ycf1:: KanMX6, pep4::KanMX6, vps4::KanMX6, and pdr5::KanMX6 strains, were purchased from OpenBiosystems. Gene deletion in each strain was confirmed by PCR using gene-specific primer sets. We received end4-1 (31Raths S. Rohrer J. Crausaz F. Riezman H. J.

Caroline Philpott (National Institute of Health), Bruno André, (Université Libre de Bruxelles), and Dieter Wolf (Universität Stuttgart), respectively. Yeast cells were cultured with synthetic complete (SC) 2The abbreviations used are: SC, synthetic complete; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; WT, wild type; MBD, metal-binding domain. medium (2% dextrose, 0.2% amino acid mixture, and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base) lacking specific amino acids for plasmid selection. If no temperature is specified, the cells were cultured at 30 °C. For phenotypical analysis on solid medium (1.5% agar), 5 μl of yeast cells (A600 = 1.0) were spotted on selective medium supplemented with the indicated concentrations of cadmium (CdCl2) or copper (CuCl2) and incubated at 30 °C for 2 days before photography. Cycloheximide chases were performed by the addition of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide to logarithmically growing cultures prior to collection into equal volumes of ice-cold kill buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 15 mm NaN3) at the indicated time points. For proteasome inhibition, a Δpdr5 strain that blocks proteasome inhibitor efflux (34Fleming J.A. Lightcap E.S. Sadis S. Thoroddsen V. Bulawa C.E. Blackman R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plasmid Construction and Manipulation—If no expression vector is specified, single copy yeast vectors (p416-GPD) (35Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar) were used for glyceradehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene promoter-driven constitutive expression of Pca1, N-terminal truncated Pca1, CaCRP, Pca1-CaCRP fusion, N-terminal 250–350 peptide, Fet3 iron oxidase, CL1 degradation signal peptide, and Gap1 general amino acid permease. For the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or hemagglutinin (HA) epitope fusion, NotI-flanked GFP or three tandem HA epitopes were inserted into the NotI site, which was artificially generated after ATG translation start codon by PCR. Expression plasmids of CL1 artificial degradation signal fused with GFP were constructed as described (36Gilon T. Chomsky O. Kulka R.G.

Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41463-41472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We sequenced all constructs to confirm correct sequence and in frame fusion. Common molecular biology techniques, including plasmid amplification using Escherichia coli, and purification, followed previously established methods (38Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (1987) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Plasmid transformation into yeast was performed using the lithium acetate method (39Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—Yeast cells were cultured in SC selective medium at 30 °C with agitation until mid-log phase. When indicated, metals (CdCl2 or CuCl2) were added to the culture medium prior to imaging. The cells were collected, resuspended in PBS, and imaged on a confocal microscope (Olympus FV500) as described (30Adle D.J. Sinani D. Kim H. Lee J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 947-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Total protein extracts were prepared by breaking cells with glass beads in PBS containing protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini) (Roche Applied Science) and 1% Triton X-100. Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The lysates were denatured in SDS sample buffer containing dithiothreitol (25 mm) for 15 min at 37 °C, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. GFP fusion proteins were detected by rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). HA-tagged proteins were probed with rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibodies (Rockland) and secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Loading control, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), was detected with mouse monoclonal anti-PGK antibodies (Molecular Probes) and secondary sheep anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). The signals were captured on film (Midwest Scientific) by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico) (Pierce). Detection of Ubiquitination—The cells were broken by glass beads in PBS containing protease inhibitors (Complete Mini) (Roche Applied Science), 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100. HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with a ProFound™ HA tag IP/Co-IP kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The proteins were eluted by incubation of immobilized anti-HA agarose beads in 2× SDS sample buffer at 37 °C for 15 min and reduced in the presence of 0.1 m dithiothreitol for an additional 15 min at 37 °C. Ubiquitin-conjugated proteins were detected by immunoblotting using mouse monoclonal antibodies against ubiquitin (Covance). Cadmium Rapidly Induces Pca1 Expression by Increasing Stability—A unique feature of Pca1 is a cytosolic cysteine-rich N-terminal extension of nearly 400 residues (Fig. 1A). To investigate the mechanism underlying the post-transcriptional regulation and the role of the N-terminal extension in turnover of Pca1, we have constructed expression plasmids of full-length Pca1 and Pca1 with truncation of the first 392 amino acids. A GFP or triple HA epitope was fused at the N terminus. All of the Pca1 constructs were functional in conferring cadmium resistance (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis of Pca1 showed that Pca1 is a short-lived protein (t½ < 5 min) (Fig. 1C). However, up-regulation of Pca1 is clearly visible 5 min after the addition of cadmium to culture medium (Fig. 1D), indicating a rapid cellular response to cadmium. Pca1 tagged with the GFP or c-Myc epitope at the N or C terminus, respectively, also showed similar regulation by cadmium (data not shown), suggesting that the effect of cadmium on Pca1 expression is independent of epitope or its location. This expression control by cadmium can be explained by enhanced translation or stability of Pca1 protein. To decipher these two possibilities, Pca1 turnover rate was examined by cycloheximide chases in the absence or presence of cadmium in culture media. Indeed, stability of Pca1 is dramatically increased in the presence of cadmium (Fig. 1E). These data suggest that the induction of Pca1 occurs through the ability of cadmium to prevent the rapid turnover of Pca1. Pca1 Is Not Stabilized in a Strain Defective in Endocytosis—In yeast, several plasma membrane proteins are internalized into endocytic vesicles that enter the early endosome where they can be recycled back to the surface or are delivered to the vacuole for degradation (40Horák J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 139-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 41Lemmon S.K. Traub L.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We considered that Pca1 might be transiently localized at the cell surface before being rapidly internalized and degraded. In this pattern of trafficking, cadmium sensing would shift the distribution of Pca1 to the cell surface for cadmium efflux. If the internalization step were to be blocked, then Pca1 would be expected to accumulate at the plasma membrane in the absence of cadmium. To test this possibility, we investigated the subcellular localization of Pca1 fused with GFP (Fig. 1B) in a strain harboring a temperature-sensitive allele of END4. This strain exhibits conditional defects in both fluid phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis at the restrictive temperature (31Raths S. Rohrer J. Crausaz F. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy revealed that GFP-Pca1 expressed in the end4-1 mutant at the restrictive temperature did not accumulate at the plasma membrane (data not shown) and remained unstable as demonstrated by cycloheximide chase (Fig. 2A). The defect in endocytosis was confirmed by inhibition of internalization of the membrane impermeable dye, Lucifer Yellow CH (31Raths S. Rohrer J. Crausaz F. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) in the end4-1 strain at the restrictive temperature (data not shown). These results suggest that Pca1 turnover in the absence of cadmium occurs either at the plasma membrane or before sorting to the plasma membrane. Pca1 Degradation Is Dependent on the Proteasome But Not Vacuolar Proteases—Plasma membrane proteins can be directly sorted to the vacuole for degradation. For instance the Gap1 amino acid permease is directly targeted to the vacuole when preferred nitrogen sources are available (42Roberg K.J. Rowley N. Kaiser C.A. J.

Perhaps in an analogous manner Pca1 may sense cadmium before trafficking to the plasma membrane or is otherwise degraded by the vacuole. To test this, we examined localization and turnover rate of Pca1 in a Δpep4 strain that is deficient in vacuolar protease activity (43Ammerer G. Hunter C.P. Rothman J.H. Saari G.C. Valls L.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2490-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). GFP-Pca1 did not accumulate in the vacuole of the Δpep4 strain, which was distinct from Fet3-GFP, a cell surface iron oxidase, previously shown to undergo vacuolar degradation (44Felice M.R. De Domenico I. Li L. Ward D.M. Bartok B. Musci G. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22181-22190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (data not shown). A cycloheximide chase confirmed that Pca1 undergoes degradation at a similar rate in the Δpep4 background compared with an isogenic wild type strain (Fig. 2B), suggesting no significant role for vacuolar proteases in degradation of Pca1. The dependence of Pca1 degradation through the vacuolar/endosomal pathway was further examined in a Δvps4 strain, which is defective in both anterograde (late endosome-to-vacuole) and retrograde (late endosome-to-Golgi) trafficking (74Babst M. Sato T.K. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1820-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Resident proteins of the late endosome are typically trapped in prevacuolar compartments/multivesicular bodies in Δvps4 cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, GFP-Pca1 does not accumulate in such compartments in the Δvps4 mutant, unlike Fet4-GFP, which undergoes vacuolar degradation. We conclude that Pca1 degradation is not dependent on the vacuolar degradation pathway. Given that Pca1 turnover is not dependent on vacuolar proteases, we questioned whether the rapid degradation of Pca1 was dependent upon the proteasome. Indeed, treatment of cells with the protease inhibitor MG132 led to a significant increase in Pca1 expression compared with vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 2D). This experiment was performed in a Δpdr5 strain, previously shown to limit the efflux of protease inhibitors (34Fleming J.A. Lightcap E.S. Sadis S. Thoroddsen V. Bulawa C.E. Blackman R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We also examined the steady state expression of Pca1 in a pre1-1 pre2-1 double mutant, which is defective in proteasomal activity (33Heinemeyer W. Gruhler A. Mohrle V. Mahe Y. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5115-5120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, Pca1 is stabilized in this strain although to a much lesser extent, which is likely due to some remaining proteolytic activities in the pre1-1 pre2-1 strain that participates in Pca1 degradation (Fig. 2E). Consistent with the fact that ubiquitination is a prerequisite for proteasomal targeting, ubiquitination of Pca1 was readily detectible (Fig. 2F). However, it is diminished to nondetectable levels after cells are exposed to cadmium (Fig. 2F). This observation hints toward a mechanistic explanation for the role of cadmium in preventing the degradation of its own exporter. Rsp5 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that is known to be involved in regulation of several plasma membrane proteins, such as metal-dependent down-regulation of the Znt1 zinc transporter and Smf1 manganese transporter (40Horák J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 139-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, an Rsp5-deficient strain did not stabilize Pca1 (data not shown), suggesting no role for this ubiquitin-protein ligase in Pca1 turnover. To exclude the possibility that stabilization of Pca1 by cadmium may reflect toxic effects of cadmium on the cellular systems for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, we tested the effects of cadmium on the expression of GFP-CL1 that has been utilized as a reporter for determining the activities of the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway (45Zhang F. Su K. Yang X. Bowe D.B. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Cell. 2003; 115: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2G, cadmium exposure at the same concentrations that markedly stabilize Pca1 (Fig. 1E) had no significant influence on the expression levels of GFP-CL1. Thus, cadmium inhibition of proteasomal degradation of Pca1 is specific. Our previous data also showed that Pca1 protein expression is enhanced when yeast cells are exposed to cadmium as low as 1 μm concentrations (30Adle D.J. Sinani D. Kim H. Lee J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 947-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which are similar to those found in plants where natural yeast cells grow (6Chaney R.L. Malik M. Li Y.M. Brown S.L. Brewer E.P. Angle J.S. Baker A.J. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). The Cysteine-rich Cytosolic Extension Contains a Degradation Signal—We postulated that the cysteinerich N-terminal extension of Pca1 might contain a metal-responding degradation signal. Indeed, whereas full-length Pca1 is hardly detectable in the absence of copper or cadmium, deletion of this domain (Pca1Δ392) resulted in constitutive expression at the cell surface even in the absence of cadmium (Fig. 3, A and B). These data strongly suggest that Pca1 turnover occurs via this domain. Consistent with the idea that Pca1 ubiquitination is dependent on a degradation signal within the N-terminal domain, ubiquitination was not detected in Pca1Δ392 (Fig. 3C). Although the Pca1(1–392) domain is necessary for Pca1 turnover, co-expression of this domain with Pca1Δ392 separately did not lead to enhanced turnover of Pca1Δ392 (data not shown). This suggests that to serve as a degradation signal for Pca1, this domain should be associated with the entire protein. To determine whether the N-terminal regulatory domain is sufficient fo"
https://openalex.org/W1988730514,"Background Monogamy, together with abstinence, partner reduction, and condom use, is widely advocated as a key behavioral strategy to prevent HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. We examined the association between the number of sexual partners and the risk of HIV seropositivity among men and women presenting for HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) in northern Tanzania. Methodology/ Principal Findings Clients presenting for HIV VCT at a community-based AIDS service organization in Moshi, Tanzania were surveyed between November 2003 and December 2007. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, reasons for testing, sexual behaviors, and symptoms were collected. Men and women were categorized by number of lifetime sexual partners, and rates of seropositivity were reported by category. Factors associated with HIV seropositivity among monogamous males and females were identified by a multivariate logistic regression model. Of 6,549 clients, 3,607 (55%) were female, and the median age was 30 years (IQR 24–40). 939 (25%) females and 293 (10%) males (p<0.0001) were HIV seropositive. Among 1,244 (34%) monogamous females and 423 (14%) monogamous males, the risk of HIV infection was 19% and 4%, respectively (p<0.0001). The risk increased monotonically with additional partners up to 45% (p<0.001) and 15% (p<0.001) for women and men, respectively with 5 or more partners. In multivariate analysis, HIV seropositivity among monogamous women was most strongly associated with age (p<0.0001), lower education (p<0.004), and reporting a partner with other partners (p = 0.015). Only age was a significant risk factor for monogamous men (p = 0.0004). Interpretation Among women presenting for VCT, the number of partners is strongly associated with rates of seropositivity; however, even women reporting lifetime monogamy have a high risk for HIV infection. Partner reduction should be coupled with efforts to place tools in the hands of sexually active women to reduce their risk of contracting HIV."

We sought to answer the question of whether high-quality research productivity is associated with investigator's age. We randomly selected 300 highly cited scientists (50 from each of 6 different biomedical fields, specifically immunology, microbiology, neuroscience, psychology-psychiatry, clinical medicine, and biology-biochemistry). Then, we identified the top 5 highly cited articles (within 10 yr after publication adjusted for the expansion of the literature) as first author of each of them. Subsequently, we plotted the distribution of the 1500 analyzed articles of the 300 studied scientists in the eight 5-year intervals of investigator's age during the year of article publication (21-25 to 55-60 yr of age), adjusted for person-years of contribution of each scientist in the various age groups. Highly cited research productivity plotted a curve that peaked at the age group of 31-35 yr of age and then gradually decreased with advancing age. However, a considerable proportion of this highly cited research was produced by older scientists (in almost 20% of the analyzed articles, researchers were older than 50 yr). The results were similar in another analysis of the single most cited article of each studied scientist. In conclusion, high-quality scientific productivity in the biomedical fields as a function of investigator's age plots an inverted U-shaped curve, in which significant decreases take place from around 40 yr of age and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W2032866042,"Previous studies showed that valyl-tRNA synthetase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains an N-terminal polypeptide extension of 97 residues, which is absent from its bacterial relatives, but is conserved in its mammalian homologues. We showed herein that this appended domain and its human counterpart are both nonspecific tRNA-binding domains (K(d) approximately 0.5 microm). Deletion of the appended domain from the yeast enzyme severely impaired its tRNA binding, aminoacylation, and complementation activities. This N-domain-deleted yeast valyl-tRNA synthetase mutant could be rescued by fusion of the equivalent domain from its human homologue. Moreover, fusion of the N-domain of the yeast enzyme or its human counterpart to Escherichia coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase enabled the otherwise ""inactive"" prokaryotic enzyme to function as a yeast enzyme in vivo. Different from the native yeast enzyme, which showed different affinities toward mixed tRNA populations, the fusion enzyme exhibited similar binding affinities for all yeast tRNAs. These results not only underscore the significance of nonspecific tRNA binding in aminoacylation, but also provide insights into the mechanism of the formation of aminoacyl-tRNAs."

Specifically, we silenced the expression of the regulatory MAT-IIβ subunit in Jurkat cells and accordingly shifted the Km L−Met of the enzyme 10–15-fold above the physiologic levels of l-Met, thereby reducing enzyme activity and SAMe pools, inducing excessive apoptosis and diminishing leukemic cell growth in vitro and in vivo.

As the main methyl group donor, it methylates DNA, RNA, fatty acids, proteins, and small molecules and regulates several transcription and translation processes, protein function, and membrane integrity. SAMe is also involved in DNA mismatch repair, chromatin modeling, epigenetic modifications and imprinting, cell replication, neurotransmission, and signaling (11Loenen W.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Additionally, SAMe is an important precursor of the polyamines and a major player in biological trans-sulfuration as well as folic acid and one-carbon metabolism (8Kotb M. Geller A.M. Pharmacol.

Unfortunately, chemical inhibitors of SAMe synthesis have been difficult to generate in quantities needed for clinical use, and most were either unstable, reversible, nonspecific, or highly toxic because no cell can survive total inhibition of SAMe synthesis. To this end, our approach has been to take advantage of the dependence on higher SAMe levels in leukemic cells to diminish rather than totally block their ability to synthesize the needed amount of SAMe and thereby selectively halt their growth while sparing normal cells. The advent of novel biotools that can selectively silence protein expression has made it possible to initiate studies to target the regulatory subunit of methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), which catalyzes the synthesis of SAMe from l-Met and ATP. All living organisms have at least one MAT enzyme (5De La Rosa J. LeGros Jr., H.L. Geller A.M. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10699-10704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Coulter A. Lombardini J.B. Sufrin J. Talalay P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1974; 10: 319-334PubMed Google Scholar). Mammals have liver-specific MAT-I/III and another isozyme, MAT-II, that is expressed in all tissues (21Kotb M. Kredich N.M. J. Biol.

MAT-I/III are tetramer/dimer forms of a catalytic α1 subunit, and they differ considerably in their kinetic and physical properties. It is believed that this differential oligomerization of MAT-α1 is an important adaptation to cope with special metabolic requirements in the liver, where SAMe levels need to be maintained at a certain range inasmuch as a deficiency or excess of SAMe has been associated with serious pathology (23Hoffman J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 94: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24Mato J.M. Corrales F.J. Lu S.C.

In livers of healthy subjects, MAT-III, which has a high Km L−Met (80–100 μm), is the major isoform. By contrast, MAT-II is a hetero-oligomer that has a catalytic α2 subunit and a regulatory β subunit with a Km L−Met of 4–20 μm (21Kotb M. Kredich N.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1985; 260: 3923-3930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fetal liver and certain adult liver diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma, α1 subunit expression is diminished and replaced by α2, along with the induction of MAT-IIβ expression (27Garcia-Trevijano E.R.

In several of our previous studies, we showed that MAT-IIβ plays a crucial physiological role by lowering the Km of MAT-II for l-Met from 55–65 μm down to 3.5–20 μm (26Halim A.B. LeGros L. Geller A.

We report that MAT-IIβ subunit specific shRNA successfully silenced the expression of the MAT-IIβ regulatory subunit in the Jurkat leukemic T cell line and increased the enzyme Km L−Met by 10–15-fold, consequently depleting SAMe pools, inducing excessive apoptosis, and diminishing the growth of these leukemic cells in physiologic l-Met concentrations, both in vitro and in vivo in a humanized NOD/Scid IL-2Rγnull mouse model of leukemia. Leukemic Cells—Jurkat T cells (E6–1; ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with either 10% fetal bovine serum or 1% HL-1 supplement (±l-Met), 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml of penicillin. Generation of pHSPG-shRNA Retrovirus—We designed several shRNA sequences to target MAT-IIβ expression and BLAST-searched these sequences against the human genome data base to ensure their specificity for our target gene.

We modified pHSPG by including a Histone 1 promoter needed for shRNA formation (34Coffield V.M. Helms W.S. Jiang Q. Su L. J. Exp.

Ting J.P. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The design of different MAT-IIβ-specific pHSPG-shRNA driven by the Histone 1 promoter is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. The effect of several control and MAT-IIβ-specific pHSGP-shRNA constructs on MAT-IIβ expression were initially tested in transiently transfected Cos-1 cells. These studies showed that plasmid pHSGP-shRNA-1110 had the highest gene silencing activity and was not toxic to the Cos-1 cells, and thus we packaged it into HSPG-V1110 viral particles using HEK-293T cells and the CaCl2 transfection method (35Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). We also generated a control, empty virus without shRNA (V1302) and V1324 that encodes an shRNA for an irrelevant, mouse plexin A1 gene (37Wong A.W. Brickey W.J. Taxman D.J. van Deventer H.W. Reed W. Gao J.X. Zheng P. Liu Y. Li P. Blum J.S. McKinnon K.P. Ting J.P. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Transduction with HSPG-shRNA Retrovirus—We transduced Jurkat cells (106 cells) by adding 8 mg/ml polybrene plus 700 ml of viral supernatants and incubating for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were spun at 2000 rpm for 3 h and then resuspended in fresh 1.5 ml of RPMI 1640 complete medium. We cultured the cells in 12-well tissue culture plates, repeated the transduction after 24 and/or 48 h, and then assessed transduction efficiency by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur) to determine the percentage of GFP-positive cells. This procedure typically yielded >90% GFP+ cells, which were then sorted using FACSAria (BD Biosciences) to obtain a ≥98% transduced cell population. MAT-II Subunits Expression Analysis—We lysed GFP+ sorted cells by three cycles of freeze-thawing in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol), containing a mixture of proteolytic inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) as described (5De La Rosa J. LeGros Jr., H.L. Geller A.M. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10699-10704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined in the cleared lysates by the bicinchoninic acid method (38Butron K. Biochem. J. 1956; 62: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (10844) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein extracts were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and then transblotted onto nitrocellulose papers. Expression of α2 and β subunits was determined by Western blots and probed with antibodies to MAT-IIα and MAT-IIβ proteins (4De La Rosa J. Geller A.M. LeGros Jr., H.L. Kotb M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3361-3366PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kotb M. Geller A.M. Markham G.D. Kredich N.M. De La Rosa J. Beachey E.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1040: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We also used quantitative real time PCR to assess MAT-IIα and MAT-IIβ mRNA expression. We constructed cRNA standards for each subunit and generated standard curves for each run to quantify mRNA copy number/2 μg of total RNA. Briefly, we transformed Escherichia coli strain JM109 with pTargeT/MAT-IIα subunit or pTargeT/MAT-IIβ subunit (26Halim A.B. LeGros L. Geller A. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29720-29725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and purified those plasmids using the Wizard PureFection DNA purification system (Promega). Correct pTargeT/MAT-IIα and pTargeT/MAT-IIβ plasmids were verified by sequencing, using a T7 promoter primer. T7 Ribomax large scale RNA production system (Promega) was used to generate MAT-IIα or MAT-IIβ cRNA. The number of cRNA molecules were calculated as follows: N(molecules/μl) = [C*182·5 × 1013]/K, where C = cRNA μg/μl and K = bp (40Fronhoffs S. Totzke G. Stier S. Wernert N. Rothe M. Bruning T. Koch B. Sachinidis A. Vetter H. Ko Y. Mol. Cell Probes. 2002; 16: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). For MAT-IIα cRNA, K = 1188 bp and C = 0.658 μg/μl; for MAT-IIβ cRNA, K = 1050 bp and C = 0.632. To test the efficiency of MAT-IIβ silencing, we extracted RNA from 106 untransduced or transduced cells using RNA-STAT 60 (Tel-Test), removed residual contaminating genomic DNA by DNase I treatment (Qiagen), purified the RNA using Qiagen RNeasy kit, and then converted 2 μg of the purified RNA to cDNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, 10× random hexamers, and 10 mm dNTP in the presence of RNase inhibitor (Promega). Quantitative real time PCRs were run using the fluorogenic SYBR Green quantitative real time PCR system and the ABI prism 7900 Sequence Bio-Detector (PE Biosystems). In each run, serial dilutions of MAT-IIα or MAT-IIβ cRNA (104–1010 cRNA molecules/μl) were also converted to cDNA and used to generate the standard curve for each MAT-II subunit. The PCR mixture contained 25 μl of SYBR Green PCR Master mix (Applied Biosystems), 2.5 μl containing 1.5–12 pmol of each primer, and 5 μl of the template cDNA in a final volume of 50 μl. The sequence of the MAT-IIβ specific primers were (forward, 5′-CACCTTACAGAGAGGAAGA-3′ and reverse, 5′-CAGTCACAGCACTTTCTTC-3′); and for MAT-IIα2 specific primers (forward, 5′-AAAGTGGTTCGTGAAGCTGTTAAA-3′ and reverse, 5′-CCAAGGCTACCAGCACGTTAC-3′). An 18 S RNA primer mix (Qiagen) was used for normalization. To calculate N for each test sample, we first normalized the cycle threshold (CT) to the internal normalizer (18 S) and then determined N from the standard curve using the equation Y = [MX + C]. Assay for MAT Activity—We assayed MAT activity in cell extracts as described previously (21Kotb M. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3923-3930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For kinetic analyses, we used different l-Met concentrations (1.25–80 μm), using [14C]l-Met (57.9 mCi/mmol) and supplementing with cold l-Met. Reaction velocity is expressed as units/mg protein, where 1 unit = 1 nmol of adenosylmethionine/h (21Kotb M. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3923-3930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We calculated Km and Vmax using the GraphPad Prism program. Cell Growth at Different l-Met Concentrations—We weaned the cells to grow in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% HL-1 supplement (Cambrex, NJ) plus 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml of penicillin (RPMI-HL1s medium). We seeded weaned cells (106/ml) in RPMI-HL1s medium at l-Met 5–100 μm, replaced the medium every 2 days, recorded numbers of viable cells, and then replated the cells at 106/ml for further analyses. Cell necrosis and apoptosis were determined by a flow cytometric quantification of propidium iodide and annexin-V (BD Pharmingen) stained cells, respectively. In some studies, the cells were cultured at 10 μm l-Met for 3d, harvested, counted, and replated at 106 cells/ml in fresh RPMI-HL1s medium with 10 μm l-Met. On day 6, the cells were harvested, washed, and replated in fresh medium containing 20 μm or 50 μm l-Met. The cell growth/death were determined every 3 days thereafter, replating 106 viable cells/ml each time. Measurement of SAMe Levels—We quantified SAMe levels in a neutralized 2 n perchloric acid-soluble extract by HPLC as previously detailed (4De La Rosa J. Geller A.M. LeGros Jr., H.L. Kotb M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3361-3366PubMed Google Scholar). We calculated the SAMe concentration (pmol/106 cells) from a standard curve using different concentrations of SAMe standard (USB Corp.) and then converted the values to μm based on cell volume for Jurkat cells 0.76 ml/109 cells (4De La Rosa J. Geller A.M. LeGros Jr., H.L. Kotb M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3361-3366PubMed Google Scholar). In Vivo Animal Studies—All of the animals were treated according to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee regulations (protocol 1587). We irradiated highly immune deficient NOD/ScidIL-2Rγnull mice with 3.5GY, 24 h prior to transplanting them via intraperitoneal injection of 15 × 106 V1110 or V1302 Jurkat cells. We obtained sera from mice 12 days post-injection and then once a week thereafter to quantify levels of the surrogate tumor marker, soluble β2 microglobulin, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay β2 microglobulin kit (R & D). At 4 and 5 weeks post-transplant, we sacrificed the transplanted mice (supplemental Table S1) and used fluorescence reflectance imaging to image GFP fluorescence in spleen prior to extracting splenocytes and bone marrow cells to assess tumor growth and engraftment by counting % human CD3/GFP-positive cells in each compartment by flow cytometry as detailed above. Statistical Methods—We calculated statistical significance with one-way analysis of variance and Newman-Keuls Multiple Comparison test for all the experiments except for the in vivo experiment where we used a Mann-Whitney test using the GraphPad Prism program. Successful Ablation of MAT-IIβ Expression—We designed several shRNA to ablate MAT-IIβ expression, cloned them into the retroviral plasmid pHSPG, which also expresses GFP, and screened their gene silencing efficiency and nonspecific toxicity (supplemental Fig. S1). All MAT-IIβ-specific shRNA constructs were designed to target the two splice variants of MAT-IIβ (28Yang H. Ara A.I. Magilnick N. Xia M. Ramani K. Chen H. Lee T.D. Mato J.M. Lu S.C. Gastroenterology. 2008; 134: 281-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Initial screening was done in COS-1 cells, and constructs with efficient gene silencing activity were then screened in Jurkat cells (supplemental Fig. S1). Construct V1110 had the highest MAT-IIβ silencing activity (supplemental Fig. S1) and least toxicity and was thus packaged into infectious HSPG-GFP virus (36Taxman D.J. Livingstone L.R. Zhang J. Conti B.J. Iocca H.A. Williams K.L. Lich J.D. Ting J.P. Reed W. BMC Biotechnol. 2006; 6: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We transduced Jurkat cells with the various recombinant HSPG-shRNA viruses and assessed MAT-IIβ ablation at the RNA and protein levels (supplemental Fig. S1). Controls included cells infected with an empty virus (V1302) or with a virus encoding shRNA construct (V1324) directed to the mouse plexin A1 gene (36Taxman D.J. Livingstone L.R. Zhang J. Conti B.J. Iocca H.A. Williams K.L. Lich J.D. Ting J.P. Reed W. BMC Biotechnol. 2006; 6: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although transduction efficiencies for all cells tested were ≥90%, significant reduction or complete ablation of MAT-IIβ RNA and protein expression was only seen in V1110-transduced cells (Fig. 1). By contrast, expression of MAT-IIα2 was essentially unaffected, thus indicating the MAT-IIβ specificity of V1110. In some cases, expression of MAT-IIα2 was insignificantly elevated, perhaps reflecting an attempt to increase enzyme synthesis to compensate for the lack of β expression and increase SAMe synthesis. Effect of MAT-IIβ Silencing on MAT-II Activity, Kinetics, SAMe Pool Size, and Cellular Growth—We next tested whether ablation of MAT-IIβ expression will alter MAT-II Km L−Met and reduce SAMe pools in Jurkat cells. As predicted, the Km L−Met increased from 3.5–6 μm in untransduced and control virus-transduced Jurkat cells, up to 56–62 μm in V1110 cells (Fig. 2A). Further, at the high end of physiological l-Met levels (20 μm), MAT-II specific activity was 4–5-fold lower in V1110 cells than in untransduced or control virus-transduced Jurkat cells expressing MAT-IIβ (Fig. 2B). Importantly, in the absence of MAT-IIβ, SAMe was undetectable in V1110 cells cultured at 10 μm l-Met (not shown), and even at 20 μm l-Met SAMe pool size was ∼85% less than in untransduced or control-transduced V1302 cells (9.5 ± 0.5 μm versus 62 ± 4 μm; p ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 2C). Significant 45–50%, reductions in SAMe pool size (p ≤ 0.01) were also found even when V1110 cells were maintained at 50 μm l-Met, which is ∼2.5-fold higher than the upper range of physiological l-Met levels. The sharp reduction in SAMe pool size, consequent to MAT-IIβ ablation, diminished the growth and viability of V1110 cells. At ≤20 μm l-Met, V1110 cells ceased to grow, and at 50 μm their growth was reduced by 33–36% compared with control-transduced V1302 cells (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3). By contrast, at 100 μm l-Met, V1110 cells grew at essentially the same rates and for the same duration in culture as the untransduced or control-transduced Jurkat cells (p > 0.05) (Fig. 3). Thus, at unphysiologically high l-Met levels approaching MAT-IIα2 Km without β (i.e. Km = 50–60 μm), V1110 leukemic cells appear to have satisfied their SAMe needs and grew normally. These results indicate that diminished V1110 cell growth at physiologic l-Met levels was a direct consequence of specific MAT-IIβ silencing, which caused an upper shift in Km L−Met of MAT-II and a significant reduction of SAMe synthesis and pools. Cell Death and Apoptosis of Leukemic Cells Lacking MAT-IIβ—Significant reduction in growth rates of V1110 cells at physiological l-Met levels was associated with a significant increase in both cell necrosis and apoptosis (Fig. 4). At physiologic l-Met levels (5, 10, and 20 μm), the extent of necrosis in the V1110 cells was significantly higher (20–55%) than in untransduced or control V1302 cells (p < 0.001). Minimal cell death was seen at 50 μm l-Met; however, V1110 cells exhibited ∼70–80% higher levels of apoptosis than the control leukemic cells even at this unphysiological l-Met concentration (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4). This is likely attributed to the 50% reduction in SAMe pool size even at 50 μm l-Met (Fig. 2). Taken together, these findings indicate that the growth and viability of V1110 cells lacking MAT-IIβ expression remained at a selective disadvantage, even at more than twice the higher end of physiological l-Met levels.

https://openalex.org/W2084123693,"Background Effective management depends upon accurately estimating trends in abundance of bird populations over time, and in some cases estimating abundance. Two population estimation methods, double observer (DO) and double sampling (DS), have been advocated for avian population studies and the relative merits and short-comings of these methods remain an area of debate. Methodology/Principal Findings We used simulations to evaluate the performances of these two population estimation methods under a range of realistic scenarios. For three hypothetical populations with different levels of clustering, we generated DO and DS population size estimates for a range of detection probabilities and survey proportions. Population estimates for both methods were centered on the true population size for all levels of population clustering and survey proportions when detection probabilities were greater than 20%. The DO method underestimated the population at detection probabilities less than 30% whereas the DS method remained essentially unbiased. The coverage probability of 95% confidence intervals for population estimates was slightly less than the nominal level for the DS method but was substantially below the nominal level for the DO method at high detection probabilities. Differences in observer detection probabilities did not affect the accuracy and precision of population estimates of the DO method. Population estimates for the DS method remained unbiased as the proportion of units intensively surveyed changed, but the variance of the estimates decreased with increasing proportion intensively surveyed. Conclusions/Significance The DO and DS methods can be applied in many different settings and our evaluations provide important information on the performance of these two methods that can assist researchers in selecting the method most appropriate for their particular needs."
https://openalex.org/W1996554608,"Current archaeological evidence from Palau in western Micronesia indicates that the archipelago was settled around 3000–3300 BP by normal sized populations; contrary to recent claims, they did not succumb to insular dwarfism. Background Previous and ongoing archaeological research of both human burial and occupation sites throughout the Palauan archipelago during the last 50 years has produced a robust data set to test hypotheses regarding initial colonization and subsequent adaptations over the past three millennia. Principal Findings Close examination of human burials at the early (ca. 3000 BP) and stratified site of Chelechol ra Orrak indicates that these were normal sized individuals. This is contrary to the recent claim of contemporaneous “small-bodied” individuals found at two cave sites by Berger et al. (2008). As we argue, their analyses are flawed on a number of different analytical levels. First, their sample size is too small and fragmentary to adequately address the variation inherent in modern humans within and outside of Palau. Second, the size and stature of all other prehistoric (both older and contemporaneous) skeletal assemblages found in Palau fall within the normal parameters of modern human variation in the region, indicating this was not a case of insular dwarfism or a separate migratory group. Third, measurements taken on several skeletal elements by Berger et al. may appear to be from smaller-bodied individuals, but the sizes of these people compares well with samples from Chelechol ra Orrak. Last, archaeological, linguistic, and historical evidence demonstrates a great deal of cultural continuity in Palau through time as expected if the same population was inhabiting the archipelago. Conclusions Prehistoric Palauan populations were normal sized and exhibit traits that fall within the normal variation for Homo sapiens—they do not support the claims by Berger et al. (2008) that there were smaller-bodied populations living in Palau or that insular dwarfism took place such as may be the case for Homo floresiensis."
https://openalex.org/W2106574224,"Previous studies have shown that loss of the type B histone acetyltransferase Hat1p leads to defects in telomeric silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We used this phenotype to explore a number of functional characteristics of this enzyme. To determine whether the enzymatic activity of Hat1p is necessary for its role in telomeric silencing, a structurally conserved glutamic acid residue (Glu-255) that has been proposed to be the enzymes catalytic base was mutated. Surprisingly neither this residue nor any other acidic residues near the enzymes active site were essential for enzymatic activity. This suggests that Hat1p differs from most histone acetyltransferases in that it does not use an acidic amino acid as a catalytic base. The effects of these Hat1p mutants on enzymatic activity correlated with their effects on telomeric silencing indicating that the ability of Hat1p to acetylate substrates is important for its in vivo function. Despite its presumed role in the acetylation of newly synthesized histones in the cytoplasm, Hat1p was found to be a predominantly nuclear protein. This subcellular localization of Hat1p is important for its in vivo function because a construct that prevents its accumulation in the nucleus caused defects in telomeric silencing similar to those seen with a deletion mutant. Therefore, the presence of catalytically active Hat1p in the cytoplasm is not sufficient to support normal telomeric silencing. Hence both enzymatic activity and nuclear localization are necessary characteristics of Hat1p function in telomeric silencing."
https://openalex.org/W2126066798,"Unequal segregation of cell fate determinants at mitosis is a conserved mechanism whereby cell fate diversity can be generated during development. In Drosophila, each sensory organ precursor cell (SOP) divides asymmetrically to produce an anterior pIIb and a posterior pIIa cell. The Par6-aPKC complex localizes at the posterior pole of dividing SOPs and directs the actin-dependent localization of the cell fate determinants Numb, Partner of Numb (Pon) and Neuralized at the opposite pole. The plasma membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) regulates the plasma membrane localization and activity of various proteins, including several actin regulators, thereby modulating actin-based processes. Here, we have examined the distribution of PIP2 and of the PIP2-producing kinase Skittles (Sktl) in mitotic SOPs. Our analysis indicates that both Sktl and PIP2 reporters are uniformly distributed in mitotic SOPs. In the course of this study, we have observed that overexpression of full-length Pon or its localization domain (LD) fused to the Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP::Pon(LD)) results in asymmetric distribution of Sktl and PIP2 reporters in dividing SOPs. Our observation that Pon overexpression alters polar protein distribution is relevant because RFP::Pon(LD) is often used as a polarity marker in dividing progenitors."
