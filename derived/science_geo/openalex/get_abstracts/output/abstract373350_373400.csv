https://openalex.org/W2108531121,"Patterns of Change The global climate record of the past 1500 years shows two long intervals of anomalous temperatures before the obvious anthropogenic warming of the 20th century: the warm Medieval Climate Anomaly between roughly 950 and 1250 A.D. and the Little Ice Age between around 1400 and 1700 A.D. It has become increasingly clear in recent years, however, that climate changes inevitably involve a complex pattern of regional changes, whose inhomogeneities contain valuable insights into the mechanisms that cause them. Mann et al. (p. 1256 ) analyzed proxy records of climate since 500 A.D. and compared their global patterns with model reconstructions. The results identify the large-scale processes—like El Niño and the North Atlantic Oscillation—that can account for the observations and suggest that dynamic responses to variable radiative forcing were their primary causes."
https://openalex.org/W2162877470,"Anti-MicroRNA Antiviral MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs found in eukaryotes and viruses. They are critical regulators of a wide range of cellular processes. The highly conserved miRNA miR-122 is required for infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV), a leading cause of liver disease in humans. Present HCV treatment regimes can have serious side effects and are effective in only 50% of cases. In order to try to tackle HCV infection, Lanford et al. (p. 198 , published online 3 December) targeted miR-122 using a complementary locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligonucleotide. Treatment of chimpanzees infected by HCV with the LNA antagonist resulted in a long-term reduction of disease symptoms without the concomitant appearance of resistant strains of the virus."

Although the bulk ground state is rhombohedral (with the electrical polarization along the [111] direction), in thin films and under epitaxial strain, the material can be tetragonally distorted (polarization along [001]). Zeches et al. (p. 977 ) show that under compressive strain, these films are monoclinic, a phase that is highly stable because it comprises the same symmetry as the monoclinic phase which has been reported at the so-called morphotropic phase boundaries in technologically important ferroelectrics. This work offers the possibility of obtaining large piezoelectric responses in lead-free systems."
https://openalex.org/W2133782445,"Interconversion of water and hydrogen in unitized regenerative fuel cells is a promising energy storage framework for smoothing out the temporal fluctuations of solar and wind power. However, replacement of presently available platinum catalysts by lower-cost and more abundant materials is a requisite for this technology to become economically viable. Here, we show that the covalent attachment of a nickel bisdiphosphine-based mimic of the active site of hydrogenase enzymes onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes results in a high-surface area cathode material with high catalytic activity under the strongly acidic conditions required in proton exchange membrane technology. Hydrogen evolves from aqueous sulfuric acid solution with very low overvoltages (20 millivolts), and the catalyst exhibits exceptional stability (more than 100,000 turnovers). The same catalyst is also very efficient for hydrogen oxidation in this environment, exhibiting current densities similar to those observed for hydrogenase-based materials."

Hulleman and Harackiewicz (p. 1410 ) designed an experiment to find out what drives high-school students. First-year high-school students were asked either to write about what they had just learned or about how what they had just learned connected to some facet of their personal lives. Connections of personal relevance were stronger than good grades for predicting interest in further science courses and future science careers. This low-cost intervention seemed to have its largest effect on students who began the class with the least amount of confidence in their abilities."
https://openalex.org/W2117558319,"GRACE and Movement Together Recent measurements of the rate of mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet vary approximately by a factor of three. Resolving these discrepancies is essential for determining the current mass balance of the ice sheet and to project sea level rise in the future. Van den Broeke et al. (p. 984 ) obtained consistent estimates from two independent methods, one based on observations of ice movement combined with model calculations and the other on remote gravity measurements made by the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellites. The combination of these approaches also resolves the separate contributions of surface processes and of ice dynamics, the two major routes of ice mass loss."
https://openalex.org/W2124242199,"The ends of eukaryotic chromosomes have the potential to be mistaken for damaged or broken DNA and must therefore be protected from cellular DNA damage response pathways. Otherwise, cells might permanently arrest in the cell cycle, and attempts to “repair” the chromosome ends would have devastating consequences for genome integrity. This end-protection problem is solved by protein-DNA complexes called telomeres. Studies of mammalian cells have recently uncovered the mechanism by which telomeres disguise the chromosome ends. Comparison to unicellular eukaryotes reveals key differences in the DNA damage response systems that inadvertently threaten chromosome ends. Telomeres appear to be tailored to these variations, explaining their variable structure and composition."
https://openalex.org/W1967695195,"Coordinating Neuronal Assemblies Theoretical models predict the existence of so-called hub neurons—highly connected cells that strongly influence the synchronization of spiking activity in a large group of neurons. However, experimental evidence for the existence of these neuronal hubs is lacking. Bonifazi et al. (p. 1419 ) used high-resolution, two-photon calcium imaging to measure spontaneous calcium fluctuations in hundreds of neurons simultaneously and determined the relative timing of these fluctuations. Examination of functional connectivity maps, based on temporal correlation measurements, revealed a subpopulation of GABAergic hub neurons displaying a remarkably widespread axonal arborization that orchestrated network synchrony in developing hippocampal networks. Spontaneous network synchronizations in developing hippocampus caused giant depolarizing potentials in individual neurons, and manipulating the spike activity in potential hub cells influenced network activity."
https://openalex.org/W2053923926,"Cooperative Reduction Selective redox transformation remains a general challenge in chemical synthesis. All too often, the most readily available precursor to a compound must be over-reduced (or over-oxidized) and then carefully coaxed back to a desired intermediate state. Such is the case with the synthesis of cyclohexanone, which is mass-produced for use in the preparation of nylon: Access by direct reduction of phenol is plagued by the rapid addition of too many hydrogen atoms to the substrate, producing an alcohol (cyclohexanol) in place of the ketone. Liu et al. (p. 1250 ) have discovered that the unexpected cooperation of supported palladium and a Lewis acid such as aluminum trichloride—two catalysts widely used alone but rarely in concert—facilitates highly selective conversion of phenol to cyclohexanone near room temperature. The key appears to be inhibition of the undesired ketone-to-alcohol reduction step by the Lewis acid."

https://openalex.org/W2003787610,"Loss-of-function genetic screens in model organisms have elucidated numerous biological processes, but the diploid genome of mammalian cells has precluded large-scale gene disruption. We used insertional mutagenesis to develop a screening method to generate null alleles in a human cell line haploid for all chromosomes except chromosome 8. Using this approach, we identified host factors essential for infection with influenza and genes encoding important elements of the biosynthetic pathway of diphthamide, which are required for the cytotoxic effects of diphtheria toxin and exotoxin A. We also identified genes needed for the action of cytolethal distending toxin, including a cell-surface protein that interacts with the toxin. This approach has both conceptual and practical parallels with genetic approaches in haploid yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2123634400,"The genome of Mycoplasma pneumoniae is among the smallest found in self-replicating organisms. To study the basic principles of bacterial proteome organization, we used tandem affinity purification-mass spectrometry (TAP-MS) in a proteome-wide screen. The analysis revealed 62 homomultimeric and 116 heteromultimeric soluble protein complexes, of which the majority are novel. About a third of the heteromultimeric complexes show higher levels of proteome organization, including assembly into larger, multiprotein complex entities, suggesting sequential steps in biological processes, and extensive sharing of components, implying protein multifunctionality. Incorporation of structural models for 484 proteins, single-particle electron microscopy, and cellular electron tomograms provided supporting structural details for this proteome organization. The data set provides a blueprint of the minimal cellular machinery required for life."
https://openalex.org/W1968698890,"To study basic principles of transcriptome organization in bacteria, we analyzed one of the smallest self-replicating organisms, Mycoplasma pneumoniae. We combined strand-specific tiling arrays, complemented by transcriptome sequencing, with more than 252 spotted arrays. We detected 117 previously undescribed, mostly noncoding transcripts, 89 of them in antisense configuration to known genes. We identified 341 operons, of which 139 are polycistronic; almost half of the latter show decaying expression in a staircase-like manner. Under various conditions, operons could be divided into 447 smaller transcriptional units, resulting in many alternative transcripts. Frequent antisense transcripts, alternative transcripts, and multiple regulators per gene imply a highly dynamic transcriptome, more similar to that of eukaryotes than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2062771530,"Flowery Regulator Control of gene transcription is multilayered, depending on transcription factors, epigenetic mechanisms, and interactions with small RNA molecules. Liu et al. (p. 94 , published online 3 December) have now found that for the FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC ) gene of the plant Arabidopsis , a backwards transcript of the gene conspires with 3′ RNA-processing tools and histone demethylation to regulate the transcription of the protein-coding gene. The 3′-processing events require the antisense, not the sense, RNA transcript. It is then the sense transcript that, in the end, regulates onset of flowering."
https://openalex.org/W2078535993,"Pre-MicroRNA Export Machinery Micro (mi) RNAs play a role in the regulation of many biological processes. Long transcripts are initially processed in the nucleus to yield pre-miRNAs that are translocated through the nuclear pore complex and further processed to mature miRNAs in the cytoplasm. Okada et al. (p. 1275 ; see the Perspective by Stewart ) describe the crystal structure of pre-miRNA complexed with the exportin Exp5 and the small nuclear GTPase RanGTP. The structure shows that Exp5 and RanGTP protect the miRNA from degradation by nucleases, as well as facilitate transport to the cytoplasm. RNA recognition is mainly through ionic interactions that are sequence independent, and model-building suggests that this nuclear export machinery could accommodate other small-structured RNAs."

We demonstrated single interfaces that are defect-free and close to atomically abrupt, as well as quantum dots (i.e., Ge layers tens of atomic planes thick) embedded within Si wires. Real-time imaging of growth kinetics reveals that a low solubility of Si and Ge in the solid particle accounts for the interfacial abruptness. Solid catalysts that can form functional group IV nanowire-based structures may yield an extended range of electronic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2066844587,"Metamorphosis Receptor Identified One of the challenges facing many multicellular organisms is when to change from the juvenile stage to the reproductively mature adult. In insects, this metamorphosis is activated by the brain-derived neuropeptide, prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), when larvae reach a characteristic weight. Almost a century after this brain hormone was discovered, Rewitz et al. (p. 1403 ) have identified the PTTH receptor and its signaling cascade. The PTTH receptor is Torso (a receptor tyrosine kinase that signals through Ras/Raf/Erk), which patterns the embryonic termini during early development in response to the distantly related PTTH factor, Trunk."
https://openalex.org/W1999964226,"Quantum Division The notion of quantum mechanics is that variables are expressed as integer values. In quantum fluids, for instance, vortices are quantized in terms of the polarization and phase shifts observed as multiples of 2π, that is, full rotations of each variable around the vortex core. Theoretical work has predicted that in some instances there should be half-quantum vortices, where circumventing the vortex core is characterized by just π rotations of the phase and polarization. By observing exciton-polariton condensates Lagoudakis et al. (p. 974 ) present evidence for the existence of these long-predicted half-quantum vortices."
https://openalex.org/W2105403271,RSV in 3D Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants. RSV is an RNA virus in which the genomic RNA forms part of a nuclease-resistant helical ribonucleoprotein complex. Tawar et al. (p. 1279 ) now use x-ray and electron microscopy data to model the structure of this nucleocapsid complex and show how it can template RNA synthesis. The crystal structure shows RNA wrapped around a decameric ring of nucleocapsid protein. Combining this structure with electron microscopy data gives a model that shows how polymerase might read out the RNA bases without disassembling the nucleocapsid helix.
https://openalex.org/W2100380298,"Simply Mycoplasma The bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae , a human pathogen, has a genome of reduced size and is one of the simplest organisms that can reproduce outside of host cells. As such, it represents an excellent model organism in which to attempt a systems-level understanding of its biological organization. Now three papers provide a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of the proteome, the metabolic network, and the transcriptome of M. pneumoniae (see the Perspective by Ochman and Raghavan ). Anticipating what might be possible in the future for more complex organisms, Kühner et al. (p. 1235 ) combine analysis of protein interactions by mass spectrometry with extensive structural information on M. pneumoniae proteins to reveal how proteins work together as molecular machines and map their organization within the cell by electron tomography. The manageable genome size of M. pneumoniae allowed Yus et al. (p. 1263 ) to map the metabolic network of the organism manually and validate it experimentally. Analysis of the network aided development of a minimal medium in which the bacterium could be cultured. Finally, G‡ell et al. (p. 1268 ) applied state-of-the-art sequencing techniques to reveal that this “simple” organism makes extensive use of noncoding RNAs and has exon- and intron-like structure within transcriptional operons that allows complex gene regulation resembling that of eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1982922717,"Crystal Growing Kit For single crystals to remain intact, there is a limit to the size and number of defects that can be included before the underlying lattice is destroyed. Biological crystals, however, are known to include large macromolecules. H. Li et al. (p. 1244 ; see the Perspective by Hollingsworth ) used electron tomography to study the crystallization of calcium carbonate inside an agarose gel, observing that the crystals physically entrapped the agarose macromolecules. To accommodate the curvature induced by the polymer chains, both high- and low-energy facets formed at the fiber-crystal interfaces. Thus, physical interactions alone may be sufficient for the incorporation of macromolecules in biological crystals and it may be possible to grow unusually shaped single crystals."

(p. 1253 ) combined satellite data about upper ocean chlorophyll and sea surface temperatures to demonstrate a clear connection between phytoplankton and sea surface temperatures on a multidecadal time scale. Basin-scale ocean dynamic processes such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation connect the physical, climate-related variability to changes in phytoplankton distribution and amount. Thus, improving the reliability of forecasts of large-scale ocean dynamics may help to improve predictions of changes in ocean community ecology."

https://openalex.org/W2091715315,"Spin Transitions and Mantle Phases The extreme temperatures and pressures at depth can cause mantle minerals to undergo phase transformations. For example, it is thought that an electronic spin transition that occurs at high pressures in the lower mantle leads to the partitioning of various iron mineral phases. Using a multianvil apparatus to study a synthetic material similar in composition to the lower mantle, Irifune et al. (p. 193 , see the Perspective by Hirose ; published online 3 December) demonstrate that the spin transition occurs at lower pressures, and thus shallower depth, than suggested by earlier studies based on simpler compositions. As verification of the material's applicability in lower mantle studies, its density profile with pressure overlaps very well with those predicted by seismological models."
https://openalex.org/W2012306566,"Defining the mantle structure that lies beneath hot spots is important for revealing their depth of origin. Three-dimensional images of shear-wave velocity beneath the Hawaiian Islands, obtained from a network of sea-floor and land seismometers, show an upper-mantle low-velocity anomaly that is elongated in the direction of the island chain and surrounded by a parabola-shaped high-velocity anomaly. Low velocities continue downward to the mantle transition zone between 410 and 660 kilometers depth, a result that is in agreement with prior observations of transition-zone thinning. The inclusion of SKS observations extends the resolution downward to a depth of 1500 kilometers and reveals a several-hundred-kilometer-wide region of low velocities beneath and southeast of Hawaii. These images suggest that the Hawaiian hot spot is the result of an upwelling high-temperature plume from the lower mantle."

The quantum version of such motors can operate without dissipation, as long as there is some means to break time-reversal symmetry in the system. Salger et al. (p. 1241 ) report on a coherent quantum ratchet device consisting of Bose-Einstein condensate cold atoms placed into an asymmetric sawtooth-potential created by optical lattices. Symmetry breaking was accomplished by phase shifts in the driving potentials. As expected for such a quantum ratchet, the current depended on the initial phase of the driving potential."
https://openalex.org/W2027205525,"Dendrites Shape Interneuron Firing Basket cells, a group of fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons, play an important part in the function of neuronal networks. The mechanisms underlying the high temporal precision and short latency of basket cell activity are unclear. Hu et al. (p. 52 , published online 3 December) investigated dendrite functions in fast-spiking hippocampal basket cells and found that action potentials are initiated in the axon and propagate back into the dendrites without activity dependence but with strongly reduced amplitude. This is very different from what has been observed previously in widely investigated pyramidal cell dendrites, probably due to the high potassium to sodium conductance ratios in the dendrites of the interneurons. These dendritic mechanisms can explain the high-frequency firing and precise timing of basket cells seen in network activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2010762097,"The retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors α and γ (RORα (NR1F1) and RORγ (NR1F3)) are orphan nuclear receptors and perform critical roles in regulation of development, metabolism, and immune function. Cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate have been suggested to be RORα ligands, but the physiological significance is unclear. To date, no endogenous RORγ ligands have been described. Here, we demonstrate that 7-oxygenated sterols function as high affinity ligands for both RORα and RORγ by directly binding to their ligand-binding domains (Ki ∼20 nm), modulating coactivator binding, and suppressing the transcriptional activity of the receptors. One of the 7-oxygenated sterols, 7α-hydroxycholesterol (7α-OHC), serves as a key intermediate in bile acid metabolism, and we show that 7α-OHC modulates the expression of ROR target genes, including Glc-6-Pase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, in an ROR-dependent manner. Furthermore, glucose output from hepatocytes is suppressed by 7α-OHC functioning as an RORα/γ ligand. Thus, RORα and RORγ are ligand-regulated members of the NR superfamily and may serve as sensors for 7-oxygenated sterols.

Many of these so-called orphan receptors still have no identified ligands. The first member of the ROR subfamily of receptors (RORα) was identified in the early 1990s based on sequence similarities to the retinoic acid receptor and the retinoid X receptor, hence the name “retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor” (1Becker-André M.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The highly similar receptors, RORβ and RORγ, were identified soon after (3Carlberg C. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Staple J.K.

Commun. 1994; 205: 1976-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Like all NHRs, the RORs display the conserved domain structure with a variable amino-terminal A/B domain, a central, highly conserved DNA-binding domain containing two zinc fingers (C domain) and hinge region (domain D), and a carboxyl-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD; E domain). The three RORs display significant sequence similarities, and each ROR gene generates multiple isoforms based on alternative promoter usage and splicing. The RORs exhibit distinct patterns of expression. RORα is expressed in the liver, skeletal muscle, skin, lungs, adipose tissue, kidney, thymus, and brain (5Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N. Kerrebrock A.W.

Gene. 1996; 181: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). All RORs recognize and bind to specific sequences of DNA termed ROR-response elements (ROREs) as monomers, and these ROREs typically consist of an AGGTCA “half-site” with a 5′ AT-rich extension (2Giguère V.

Another orphan NHR subclass, the REV-ERBs (REV-ERBα (NR1D1) and REV-ERBβ (NR1D2)), also recognize the RORE sites and are often coexpressed with RORs (10Burris T.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 1509-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast to the RORs, the REV-ERBs are repressors of transcription. Until recently, the REV-ERBs were thought to be constitutive repressors of transcription; however, our recent work as well as that from the Lazar laboratory demonstrated that the porphyrin heme functions as a ligand for both REV-ERBs and is required for repression of transcription (11Raghuram S.

Both REV-ERBs and ROR share a number of target genes indicating that they coordinately regulate physiological processes. The coordinate regulation of biological processes by the RORs and REV-ERBs can be demonstrated by the manner in which they regulate the mammalian clock. Both RORs and REV-ERBs are major regulators of the cyclic expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like 1 (ARNTL also known as BMAL1) (13Guillaumond F. Dardente H. Giguère V.

RORs have also been shown to play a significant role in the regulation of metabolism, and much has been revealed by studies in the staggerer (RORαsg/sg) mouse. This mutant mouse strain carries an intragenic deletion within the RORα gene that results in a frameshift and premature stop codon rendering RORα inactive (5Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N. Kerrebrock A.W.

The staggerer mouse was initially identified due to cerebellar defects resulting in ataxia, later revealing a critical role for RORα in cerebellar development.

Reduced expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1, a key transporter for reverse cholesterol transport, has been noted in these mice that is consistent with the abnormally low levels of high density lipoprotein, which are essential for reverse cholesterol transport (20Lau P.

Genes important in the regulation of triglyceride homeostasis are dysregulated in the liver and skeletal muscle of the staggerer mouse such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c and fatty-acid synthase (20Lau P.

The size of both brown and white adipose cells are smaller in these animals, and hepatic triglyceride content is lower. Consistent with this phenotype, the animals are less susceptible to high fat diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis (20Lau P. Fitzsimmons R.L. Raichur S. Wang S.C. Lechtken A. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18411-18421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). RORγ null mice exhibit normal levels of plasma cholesterol and triglycerides (21Kang H.S. Angers M. Beak J.Y. Wu X. Gimble J.M. Wada T. Xie W. Collins J.B. Grissom S.F. Jetten A.M. Physiol. Genomics. 2007; 31: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). An interesting metabolic phenotype was revealed when staggerer mice were crossed with RORγ null mice effectively creating an RORα/γ double knock-out. Although neither individual strain showed significant alterations in plasma glucose levels, the double knock-out was hypoglycemic illustrating a role for these receptors in maintaining glucose homeostasis (21Kang H.S. Angers M. Beak J.Y. Wu X. Gimble J.M. Wada T. Xie W. Collins J.B. Grissom S.F. Jetten A.M. Physiol. Genomics. 2007; 31: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This study also demonstrated that RORα and RORγ display significant redundancy in function, which is consistent with plasma glucose levels remaining unaffected unless both receptors were lost. Even more recently, a role for RORα in regulation of glucose metabolism was characterized when Chopra et al. (22Chopra A.R. Louet J.F. Saha P. An J. Demayo F. Xu J. York B. Karpen S. Finegold M. Moore D. Chan L. Newgard C.B. O'Malley B.W. Science. 2008; 322: 1395-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) found that loss of the NHR coactivator SRC-2 in mice led to a phenotype similar to von Gierke disease, which is associated with severe hypoglycemia and abnormal accumulation of glycogen in the liver. Loss of expression of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc-6-Pase) is responsible for 80% of the diagnosed von Gierke disease cases, and it was demonstrated that SRC-2 was required for RORα to regulate this gene in a normal manner (22Chopra A.R. Louet J.F. Saha P. An J. Demayo F. Xu J. York B. Karpen S. Finegold M. Moore D. Chan L. Newgard C.B. O'Malley B.W. Science. 2008; 322: 1395-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Although several molecules have been suggested to be ligands for one or more of the RORs, identification of a bona fide functional, physiologically relevant ligand has remained elusive. Retinoids such as all-trans retinoic acid have been shown to suppress the activity of RORβ selectively, but the physiological relevance of this activity has not yet been demonstrated (23Stehlin-Gaon C. Willmann D. Zeyer D. Sanglier S. Van Dorsselaer A. Renaud J.P. Moras D. Schüle R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Some of the most interesting work on putative ROR ligands was performed by Kallen et al. (24Kallen J.A. Schlaeppi J.M. Bitsch F. Geisse S. Geiser M. Delhon I. Fournier B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1697-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), where x-ray crystallographic studies identified cholesterol in the ligand binding pocket of RORα. A later study by the same group demonstrated that cholesterol sulfate also binds within the pocket (25Kallen J. Schlaeppi J.M. Bitsch F. Delhon I. Fournier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14033-14038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although the possibility of RORα, which plays such a prominent role in lipid metabolism, functioning as a receptor for cholesterol is attractive, it remains unclear if cholesterol or a derivative of this sterol is truly a physiological ligand for RORα. Recently, we demonstrated that synthetic ligands can bind with high affinity and repress the transcriptional output of both RORα and RORγ, thus functioning as inverse agonists (26Kumar N. Solt L.A. Conkright J.J. Wang Y. Istrate M.A. Busby S.A. Garcia-Ordonez R. Burris T.P. Griffin P.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 8: 156Google Scholar). This finding suggests that there might also be natural product ligands that also behave as inverse agonists. Oxysterols were obtained from Sigma or Steraloids (Newport, RI). Gal4-RORαLBD, Gal4-RORγLBD, pTrex-RORα, and pTrex-RORγ were gifts from Phenex Pharmaceuticals AG (Ludwigshafen, Germany). pSPORT-SRC2 was provided by Cell-based Screening Core at Scripps (Jupiter, FL). pGL4-G6PC promoter reporter was kindly provided by Bert O'Malley (Baylor College of Medicine). pG5-Luc and pGL4.73 reporters were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). RORα was tagged with FLAG and subcloned into pAd/CMV/V5-DEST vector through the GatewayTM technique (Invitrogen). The adenovirus with FLAG-RORα was produced according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unless otherwise noted, oxysterols were used at a final concentration of 10 μm. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. HepG2 cells were maintained and routinely propagated in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. In experiments where lipids and sterols were depleted, cells were maintained on charcoal-treated serum (10% fetal bovine serum) and treated with 7.5 μm lovastatin and 100 μm mevalonic acid. 24 h prior to transfection, HepG2 or HEK293 cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 15 × 103 cells/well. Transfections were performed using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen). 16 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with vehicle or compound. 24 h post-treatment, the luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-GloTM luciferase assay system (Promega). The values indicated represent the means ± S.E. from four independently transfected wells. The experiments were repeated at least three times. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prizm software, and IC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis. Total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed as described previously (11Raghuram S. Stayrook K.R. Huang P. Rogers P.M. Nosie A.K. McClure D.B. Burris L.L. Khorasanizadeh S. Burris T.P. Rastinejad F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1207-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were infected with adenovirus for 24 h and then treated with vehicle, 7α-hydroxycholesterol, 7β-hydroxycholesterol, or 7-ketocholesterol (10 μm) for another 24 h. ChIP assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Immunoprecipitation with the following antibodies was performed at 4 °C overnight: anti-mouse IgG, anti-acetyl histone H3, anti-SRC2 (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery TX). ReChIP assays were performed by using the kit from Active Motif®. Anti-FLAG (Sigma) was used to do the first immunoprecipitation for all the samples. The second immunoprecipitation was performed by using anti-mouse IgG (Millipore), anti-RNA polymerase II (Millipore), or anti-SRC2 (Bethyl Laboratories). The Glc-6-Pase primers used in PCR are CCCTGAACATGTTTGCATCA (forward) and CATTCCTTCCTCCATCCTCA (reverse). Mouse primary hepatocytes were purchased from Celsis (Chicago). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The control siRNA, mouse RORα, and RORγ siRNA (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) were transfected into the cells using LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). After 24 h, cell media were switched to glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20 mm sodium lactate, plus vehicle (DMSO), or 10 μm 7α-hydroxycholesterol. Six hours later, the media were collected and measured for glucose content using Amplex® red glucose/glucose oxidase assay kit (Invitrogen). RORα and RORγ LBDs were PCR-amplified and cloned into a pGEX-2T (GE Healthcare) encoding an amino-terminal glutathione S-transferase tag following the manufacturer's instructions. The protein was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in BL21 gold (DE3) cells (Invitrogen) and purified by affinity chromatography with Protino GST/4B column (Macherey-Nagel) followed by size exclusion chromatography with HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). The protein was eluted, concentrated, and stored in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Forty five or 90 ng of purified GST-RORα or GST-RORγ was used per assay, and the assay was performed in the following buffer: 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. Receptors were incubated with various concentrations of 25-[3H]hydroxycholesterol to determine the Kd values (RORα = 3.3 ± 0.89 nm and RORγ = 5.1 ± 0.71 nm). Nonspecific binding was defined in the absence of protein as well as excess of cold 25-hydroxycholesterol and were shown to be identical. The assays were terminated by rapid filtration through pre-soaked Whatman GF/B filters (0.5% polyethyleneimine in phosphate-buffered saline) in Multiscreen plates (Millipore) and were washed three times with ice-cold assay buffer (1 ml). For the competition assay, various concentrations of sterols were incubated with receptor in the presence of 3 nm 25-[3H]hydroxycholesterol. Results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software, and the Ki was determined using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. Mutiplexed coactivator interaction assay (NR box and CoRNR box peptide interaction assay) was performed as described previously (11Raghuram S. Stayrook K.R. Huang P. Rogers P.M. Nosie A.K.

The peptide sequences used have also been described previously (11Raghuram S. Stayrook K.R. Huang P. Rogers P.M. Nosie A.K. McClure D.B. Burris L.L. Khorasanizadeh S. Burris T.P. Rastinejad F. Nat.

RORα produced for this assay was produced in Escherichia coli using high pressure refolding as described previously for farnesoid X receptor and LRH-1 (27Schoner B.E. Bramlett K.S. Guo H. Burris T.P. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2005; 85: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Solution phase amide HDX experiments were performed with a LEAP technologies (Carroboro, NC) CTC HTS twin PAL autosampler interfaced with an electrospray ionization Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Exactive, Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA). 4 μl of the 10 μm RORα-LBD stock solution (1× phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) were diluted with 16 μl of an equivalent composition D2O buffer and incubated for 10, 30, 60, 900, or 3600 s to allow hydrogen/deuterium exchange to occur (28Chalmers M.J.

Following the allotted time period, the sample was diluted to 50 μl with cold (1.5 °C) 5 m urea containing 1% trifluoroacetic acid. Protein was then passed through an immobilized pepsin column (1 mm × 2 cm made in-house) held at 1.5 °C, and the resultant peptides were captured on a C8 peptide trap (1 mm inner diameter × 10 mm). Peptides were then eluted across a high pressure liquid chromatography column (C18 50 × 1 mm, 1.9 μm) into the electrospray ionization source with a gradient of 4% CH3CN increasing to 50% CH3CN over 5 min. For the RORα plus ligand data, 10 μm ROR stock solution was incubated with 50 μm ligand prior to mixing with D2O buffer. Data represent the average of four replicates and were processed with in-house developed software (29Pascal B.D. Chalmers M.J. Busby S.A. Griffin P.R. J. Am. Soc.

Cholesterol is an essential component of biological membranes and is a precursor for biosynthesis of important lipids and hormones such as bile acids, steroid hormones, and some vitamins. Cholesterol levels are tightly regulated, and the liver plays an essential role in elimination of excess cholesterol via conversion of this sterol to bile acids. X-ray crystallography studies demonstrated that the LBD of RORα is able to bind to cholesterol (24Kallen J.A. Schlaeppi J.M. Bitsch F. Geisse S. Geiser M. Delhon I. Fournier B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1697-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and cholesterol sulfate (25Kallen J. Schlaeppi J.M. Bitsch F. Delhon I. Fournier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14033-14038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar); however, the physiological relevance of binding of these sterols to the receptor is unclear. It is also unclear whether RORα is active in the absence of any ligand or if cholesterol or another sterol may be constitutively bound conferring this activity. We found that neither depletion of lipid using cyclodextrin-treated serum and inclusion of a statin and mevalonate to the media had an effect on the transcriptional activity of RORα or RORγ in a GAL4-ROR transfection assay nor did addition of cholesterol (500 μm) (Fig. 1A). We also noted no effect of cholesterol sulfate (500 μm) in the same assay (Fig. 1B) suggesting that neither sterols are functional ligands. Previous studies using RORα LBD purified from insect cells found cholesterol, 7-dehydrocholesterol, and an unidentifiable oxysterol bound to receptor (31Bitsch F. Aichholz R. Kallen J. Geisse S. Fournier B. Schlaeppi J.M. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 323: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These authors presumed that the inability to produce RORα in E. coli was due to the lack of cholesterol in the bacteria (32Volkman J.K. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 60: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) and the potential requirement for cholesterol to stabilize the receptor. During one of our first attempts to express the LBD of RORα in E. coli, we also found that the protein was completely insoluble and was contained within inclusion bodies. However, we were able to reconstitute functional RORα LBD using high pressure denaturation-renaturation, a procedure that involves purification of the insoluble protein by ultracentrifugation and extensive washing in a sterol/lipid-free environment (27Schoner B.E. Bramlett K.S. Guo H. Burris T.P. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2005; 85: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to the fact that E. coli lack sterols, the procedure to reconstitute the LBD would likely eliminate binding of an endogenous ligand. The ability of the refolded LBD to bind to LXXLL peptides derived from a variety of coactivators was tested (11Raghuram S. Stayrook K.R. Huang P. Rogers P.M. Nosie A.K. McClure D.B. Burris L.L. Khorasanizadeh S. Burris T.P. Rastinejad F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1207-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and was found to be effective in recruiting a number of coactivator NR boxes (Fig. 1C). Based on these results, it is apparent that cholesterol is not required for LBD stability and that the apo-receptor is in an active conformation and displays constitutive activity in the absence of a sterol ligand. As discussed below, we later optimized the expression of RORα and RORγ LBDs in E. coli allowing for production of soluble proteins (for radioligand binding assays), which is also consistent with sterols not being required for solubility of the proteins. Recent studies demonstrating a role for both RORα and RORγ (21Kang H.S. Angers M. Beak J.Y. Wu X. Gimble J.M. Wada T. Xie W. Collins J.B. Grissom S.F. Jetten A.M. Physiol.

Thus, we began to examine the possibility that a key sterol in the bile acid pathway might function as a physiological ligand for the RORs. We tested the ability of a key sterol intermediate in the bile acid synthetic pathway, 7α-OHC (structure shown in Fig. 2), for its ability to modulate RORα activity in a cotransfection assay. 7α-OHC is produced in the first step of bile acid biosynthesis by the cytochrome P-450 cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) using cholesterol as the substrate. This step is the rate-limiting step in bile acid biosynthesis, and the expression of CYP7A1 is highly regulated, thus the levels of 7α-OHC reflect the degree of activation of this pathway (36Chiang J.Y.

The EMT associated with physiological processes is triggered by members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family of proteins that function as morphogens (1Lee J.M. Dedhar S. Kalluri R. Thompson E.W. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have also shown that TGF-β is the major inducer of the EMT in epithelial cells (2Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5531) Google Scholar). Fibrotic disorders associated with pathological EMT result from a series of events including inflammation, leukocyte infiltration, and the production of cytokines and growth factors. TGF-β is one of the cytokines produced during inflammation and is, therefore, thought to heavily contribute to EMT-associated fibrosis (3Kalluri R. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1776-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). However, given that TGF-β also possesses anti-inflammatory properties, the mechanism of pathological EMT induced by the inflammatory response may be multifactorial and differ from that of physiological EMT. In addition to growth factors, changes in the ECM microenvironment contribute to the EMT. Epithelial cells cultured in a type I collagen gel were found to undergo the EMT (4Zuk A. Matlin K.S. Hay E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 903-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, collagen-induced changes in cadherin expression and cell morphology in epithelial cells were shown to be dependent on activation of intracellular signaling by collagen (5Shintani Y. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2963-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These observations implicated signaling pathways activated by cell adhesion to the ECM in acquisition of the mesenchymal phenotype. Hyaluronic acid (HA), or hyaluronan, is a major component of the ECM and plays a key role in tissue homeostasis as well as in pathological tissue remodeling (6Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). HA is synthesized by hyaluronic acid synthases (HASs) located at the plasma membrane. Three isoforms of mammalian HAS catalyze the synthesis of HA of distinct molecular sizes. HAS1 and HAS2 synthesize high molecular mass HA (200–2000 kDa), whereas HAS3 synthesizes low molecular mass HA (100–1000 kDa) (7Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T.

In addition, oligosaccharide forms of HA, which inhibit binding of endogenous HA to the HA receptor CD44, attenuate the EMT associated with cardiac development (9Zeng C. Toole B.P. Kinney S.D.

Res. 2006; 99: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These findings implicate HA-dependent changes in the tissue microenvironment in induction of the EMT. CD44 is the principal transmembrane adhesion receptor for HA and plays a central role in the remodeling and degradation of HA that lead to cell migration as well as to cancer invasion and metastasis (12Ponta H.

Cancer Sci. 2004; 95: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) The cytoplasmic tail of CD44 recruits ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins that are linked to the actin cytoskeleton and thereby promote cell motility. Expression of CD44 is up-regulated not only in cancer cells but also in cells associated with inflammatory diseases (14Haynes B.F. Hale L.P. Patton K.L. Martin M.E. McCallum R.M.

However, the molecular mechanism by which the HA-CD44 interaction leads to the development of fibrotic disorders remains largely unknown. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is a disorder characterized by the formation of membranes on the surfaces of the retina and within the vitreous cavity after retinal detachment surgery, and intraocular inflammation and EMT are thought to be the pathogenesis of this disease (21Limb G.A. Chignell A.H. Woon H. Green W. Cole C.J. Dumonde D.C. Graefes Arch. Clin. Exp. Ophthalmol. 1996; 234: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22Casaroli-Marano R.P. Pagan R. Vilaró S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 2062-2072PubMed Google Scholar). The PVR membrane consists of extracellular matrix, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), retinal glial cells, fibroblasts, and inflammatory macrophages (23Campochiaro P.A. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1997; 115: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 24Lei H. Hovland P. Velez G. Haran A. Gilbertson D. Hirose T. Kazlauskas A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Intravitreal cell injection models of PVR show that not only fibroblasts, but also RPE cells, are associated with the formation of intraocular membrane (25Agrawal R.N. He S. Spee C. Cui J.Z. Ryan S.J. Hinton D.R. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Various growth factors and cytokines, which are inflammatory products of cell activation, were increased in vitreous aspirates from the eyes with PVR. One of the most prominent of the inflammatory cytokines is tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), whose mRNA and proteins are widely expressed in PVR membranes (21Limb G.A. Chignell A.H. Woon H. Green W. Cole C.J. Dumonde D.C. Graefes Arch. Clin. Exp. Ophthalmol. 1996; 234: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 26Armstrong D. Augustin A.J. Spengler R. Al-Jada A. Nickola T. Grus F. Koch F. Ophthalmologica. 1998; 212: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) TNF-α is mainly derived from activated macrophages, and RPE and glial cells in PVR membranes also releases it (27Wiedemann P. Surv. Ophthalmol. 1992; 36: 373-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Although TNF-α is thought to play a causative role in PVR, the underlying mechanism is unknown. We have now developed an in vitro model of EMT-associated fibrosis based on human RPE cells. With the use of this model, we identified TNF-α as an important inducer of EMT-associated fibrotic focus formation. In addition, we clarified that the HA-CD44-moesin interaction triggered by TNF-α is required for activation of TGF-β signaling that leads to induction of the mesenchymal phenotype in RPE cells. Furthermore, fibrosis induced by injection of TNF-α into the mouse retina was found to be markedly suppressed in CD44 knock-out mice. These findings indicate that the HA-CD44 interaction plays a key role in EMT-associated fibrotic disorders. ARPE-19 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-nutrient mixture F-12 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All experiments were performed in serum-free medium unless otherwise noted. Human recombinant TNF-α and the active form of human recombinant TGF-β2 were obtained from R&D Systems; 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) was from Wako, GF109203X, Y-27632, and SB203580 were from Calbiochem, SB431542 was from Nacalai Tesque, and hyaluronidase Streptococcus dysgalactiae was from Seikagaku. Antibodies used in the study were as follows: the anti-phosphorylated form of ERM and anti-phospho-Smad2 (Calbiochem); anti-ERM (Chemicon); anti-clathrin heavy chain and anti-caveolin1 (BD Transduction Laboratories); anti-Smad2 (Cell Signaling); anti-CD44 (BU52) for immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence staining (Ancell); anti-CD44 (IM-7.8.1) for blocking HA-CD44 binding (BioLegend); anti-N-cadherin (Calbiochem and Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-moesin for immunofluorescence staining, anti-ezrin, and anti-cytokeratin 18 as well as anti-CD44 (F10-44-2) for immunoprecipitation (Abcam); anti-TGF-β receptor II (Cell Signaling and Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and anti-α-tubulin (Sigma); anti-fibronectin (NeoMarkers); anti-moesin for immunoblot analysis (kindly provided by S. Tsukita, Osaka University). The sequences of siRNA (chimeric RNA-DNA) duplexes (Japan Bioservice) were 5′-AAAUGGUCGCUACAGCAUCTT-3′ and 5′-GAUGCUGUAGCGACCAUUUTT-3′ for human CD44 (28Bourguignon L.Y. Singleton P.A. Diedrich F. Stern R. Gilad E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26991-27007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), 5′-CUAUACAUGCGCCGUCGCATT-3′ and 5′-UGCGACGGCGCAUGUAUAGTT-3′ for human moesin, and 5′-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGATT-3′ and 5′-UCGAAGUAUUCCGCGUACGTT-3′ for luciferase (GL-2) as a control. Cells were transfected with the annealed siRNAs for 48 h with the use of the Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described (29Hirota T. Kunitoku N. Sasayama T. Marumoto T. Zhang D. Nitta M. Hatakeyama K. Saya H. Cell. 2003; 114: 585-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed on ice for 20 min, and the lysates were incubated for 2 h with antibodies to CD44 or TGF-β receptor II, after which protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 2 h. The beads were isolated by centrifugation, and the bead-bound proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis was performed as previously described (30Nagano O. Murakami D. Hartmann D. De Strooper B. Saftig P. Iwatsubo T. Nakajima M. Shinohara M. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In brief, ARPE-19 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated for 60 min with primary antibodies or biotinylated HA-binding protein (Seikagaku). The cells were then washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before incubation for 60 min with secondary antibodies labeled with either fluorescein isothiocyanate (BIOSOURCE) or Texas Red (Invitrogen). Biotinylated HA-binding protein was detected by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin (Invitrogen). Actin fibers were visualized by staining with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled phalloidin (Invitrogen). The cells were mounted in 80% glycerol or Vectashield mounting medium with propidium iodide (Vector) and visualized with a confocal microscope (Fluoview, Olympus). Total RNA was extracted from cells with the use of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). For microarray analysis, biotin-labeled cRNA probes synthesized from the total RNA were subjected to hybridization with a GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix), and hybridization was visualized with streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Raw intensity data for each experiment were first normalized by the MAS5.0 statistical algorithm (Affymetrix) and then log2-transformed for calculation of Z scores. The scores were calculated by subtracting the overall average gene intensity (within a single experiment) from the raw intensity data for each gene and then dividing the result by the standard deviation of all the measured intensities according to a previously established formula (31Cheadle C. Vawter M.P. Freed W.J. Becker K.G. J. Mol. Diagn. 2003; 5: 73-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Further statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance (32Kerr M.K. Martin M. Churchill G.A. J. Comput. Biol. 2000; 7: 819-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). For RT-PCR analysis, portions (2 μg) of total RNA were subjected to RT with an oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was performed as previously described (33Okamoto I. Morisaki T. Sasaki J. Miyake H. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Ando M. Saya H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with the primers (forward and reverse, respectively) 5′-TGAACAGAAGTTAAGGCCAAATATC-3′ and 5′-CAGGCAAAGCTGTAGAATTACATTT-3′ for TGF-β2, 5′-TCCCAGACGAAGACAGTCCCTGGAT-3′ and 5′-CACTGGGGTGGAATGTGTCTTGGTC-3′ for CD44, and 5′-TCCCTGGAGAAGAGCTACGAGC-3′ and 5′-GTAGTTTCGTGGATGCCACAGG-3′ for β-actin (internal control). ARPE-19 cells were cultured in 35-mm dishes for 4 days in the presence of TNF-α or TGF-β2. They were then fixed with methanol for 5 min, air-dried, and stained with Giemsa solution (Merck) for 15 min. The number of EAFDs was counted with the use of a light microscope. Fixed sheep red blood cells (Research Diagnostics) were layered onto a monolayer of ARPE-19 cells in a 35-mm dish and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then observed with a differential interference contrast (DIC) video microscope (CKX41, Olympus) and analyzed with the use of Flovel software (Olympus). Cells were exposed to fluorescein-labeled HA (Calbiochem) at 100 ng/ml for 6 h, washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and washed with PBS. They were then incubated for 60 min at room temperature with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) diluted in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin to visualize nuclei. The cells were washed with PBS and examined with a fluorescence microscope (Image XpressMICRO, Molecular Devices). The average binding of fluorescence-HA to each cell was quantitated with the use of Meta Xpress software. A sterile plastic micropipette tip was used to make a wound by scratching a monolayer of ARPE-19 cells in serum-free medium. Migration of cells into the wound area was monitored by video microscopy. Mouse retinal organ culture was performed as described (34Mitsuda S. Yoshii C. Ikegami Y. Araki M. Dev. Biol. 2005; 280: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with modifications. Mice were killed, and the eyes were enucleated. After removal of the anterior segment and lens and peeling of the retina from each eye, all layers of the posterior eyecup (RPE, choroid, and sclera) were cut into four segments and flattened in the presence of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) on the polyethylene terephthalate membranes (pore size, 0.4 μm) of cell culture inserts (BD Biosciences). The RPE layer adhering to the choroidal sheet was incubated in endothelial basal medium (Lonza) containing hydrocortisone, human epidermal growth factor, bovine brain extract, fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics with or without TNF-α or TGF-β2. The membranes were then removed from the inserts, and the tissue was subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. All animals were treated in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. C57BL/6J and CD44 knock-out mice (The Jackson Laboratory) at 6–8 weeks of age were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) and subjected to injection of TNF-α (400 ng in 2.5 μl of PBS) or PBS (control) into the subretinal region of one eye through the sclera. The injections were performed with a microsyringe (Hamilton) fitted with a sterile 33-gauge needle, with the uninjected contralateral eye serving as a control (35Dureau P. Legat L. Neuner-Jehle M. Bonnel S. Pecqueur S. Abitbol M. Dufier J.L. Graefes Arch. Clin. Exp. Ophthalmol. 2000; 238: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The mice were killed 14 days after injection, and the eyes were enucleated, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut at a thickness of 4 μm, depleted of paraffin, rehydrated with a graded series of ethanol solutions, and processed for immunofluorescence staining. TGF-β is a major inducer of the EMT during embryogenesis, wound healing, fibrotic disorders, and cancer invasion (2Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5531) Google Scholar, 3Kalluri R. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1776-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). In addition, chronic irritation and inflammation trigger fibrotic disorders (36Kalluri R. Zeisberg M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (3577) Google Scholar), and the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α promotes the EMT cooperatively with TGF-β (37Bates R.C. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1790-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). On the basis of this information, we first investigated the effects of TGF-β and TNF-α on the EMT in cultured epithelial cells. We studied the spontaneously derived human RPE cell line ARPE-19 because of its stable epithelial characteristics, including a cuboidal morphology and the formation of intercellular junctions mediated by N-cadherin in long term culture (38Inumaru J. Nagano O. Takahashi E. Ishimoto T. Nakamura S. Suzuki Y. Niwa S. Umezawa K. Tanihara H. Saya H. Genes Cells. 2009; 14: 703-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In retinal pigment epithelial cells, which originate from neural ectoderm, N-cadherin, rather than E-cadherin, is known to behave as dominant cadherin and form stable, zonula adherens-type junctions (39McKay B.S. Irving P.E. Skumatz C.M. Burke J.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 65: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 40Kaida M. Cao F. Skumatz C.M. Irving P.E. Burke J.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3215-3224PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β2 is the major isoform of TGF-β expressed in inflammatory eye diseases (41Connor Jr., T.B. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Danielpour D. Dart L.L. Michels R.G. de Bustros S. Enger C. Kato H. Lansing M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1661-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and induces fibrotic plaque formation in lens epithelial explants (42Banh A. Deschamps P.A. Vijayan M.M. Sivak J.G. West-Mays J.A. Mol. Vis. 2007; 13: 2248-2262PubMed Google Scholar). However, exposure to the active form of TGF-β2 alone did not have a marked effect on the morphology of ARPE-19 cells (Fig. 1A). In contrast, exposure to TNF-α induced both a pronounced shift in the morphology of ARPE-19 cells to a spindle-like fibroblastic appearance as well as the formation of foci of “piled-up” cells, as revealed by DIC microscopic observation and Giemsa staining of the fixed cells, which allowed us to easily count the number of the cell aggregation (Fig. 1, A and B). The number of TNF-α-induced cell aggregation was not significantly affected by co-stimulation with TGF-β2 (Fig. 1, A and B). However, the TNF-α-induced cell aggregation was completely blocked by a specific inhibitor of TGF-β receptor I (SB431542), which acts as a competitive ATP binding site kinase inhibitor and selectively blocks TGF-β signaling but neither bone morphogenic protein signaling nor the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and other pathways (43Callahan J.F. Burgess J.L. Fornwald J.A. Gaster L.M. Harling J.D. Harrington F.P. Heer J. Kwon C. Lehr R. Mathur A. Olson B.A. Weinstock J. Laping N.J. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 999-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 44Inman G.J. Nicolás F.J. Callahan J.F. Harling J.D. Gaster L.M. Reith A.D. Laping N.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). Furthermore, stimulation with TNF-α alone increased the abundance of TGF-β2 mRNA in ARPE-19 cells (Fig. 1C). These results suggested that co-activation of TNF-α and TGF-β2 signaling is necessary for the induction of a fibroblast-like phenotype and the cell aggregation in RPE cells. To investigate further the phenotypic change induced by TNF-α and TGF-β2 in ARPE-19 cells, we performed time-lapse video microscopy (Fig. 1D, supplemental Movies 1 and 2). In contrast to control ARPE-19 cells, which were static and remained in a flat monolayer, cells exposed to both TNF-α and TGF-β2 were highly motile and gathered together to form the piled-up foci. Fluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that the piled-up foci were composed of spindle-shaped cells and various ECM components including HA and fibronectin (Fig. 1E) as well as type I collagen and laminin (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis also showed that the combination of TNF-α and TGF-β2 both increased expression of the mesenchymal marker α-SMA as well as down-regulated that of the epithelial marker cytokeratin 18 (Fig. 1F). These data, thus, suggested that co-stimulation with TNF-α and TGF-β2 induced the EMT in RPE cells. To confirm that costimulation with TNF-α and TGF-β2 induces a gene expression profile characteristic of the EMT, we performed cDNA microarray analysis of 47,000 transcripts at various times after exposure of ARPE-19 cells to the cytokines. As we expected, the expression of EMT-related genes (1Lee J.M. Dedhar S. Kalluri R. Thompson E.W. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 45Zavadil J. Bitzer M. Liang D. Yang Y.C. Massimi A. Kneitz S. Piek E. Bottinger E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 6686-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) changed in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1G, supplemental Table 1); co-stimulation increased the expression of various mesenchymal type genes, including SNAI1 (encoding snail), CD44 (CD44), MMP9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9), FN1 (fibronectin), and COL1A1 (type 1A collagen). Conversely, the expression of key epithelial type genes, such as TJP1 (tight junction protein 1), KRT18 (cytokeratin 18), and CDH1 (E-cadherin), was inhibited by TNF-α and TGF-β2. Together, our results, thus, suggested that interplay between TNF-α and TGF-β2 signaling induces the EMT in ARPE-19 cells. For subsequent experiments, the characteristic aggregations of ARPE-19 cells induced by these cytokines were termed EAFDs. The ECM microenvironment plays a central role in induction of the EMT. Given that we found that fibronectin and HA were major ECM components of EAFDs (Fig. 1E), we investigated which of these components is more important for EMT induction in ARPE-19 cells. We then performed an erythrocyte exclusion assay to visualize the pericellular HA (Fig. 2A) and an immunoblot analysis for fibronectin expression in ARPE-19 cells (Fig. 2B). In the erythrocyte exclusion assay, a clear zone surrounding cells is generated as a result of exclusion of fixed erythrocytes by the gel-like HA coat (46Knudson C.B. Knudson W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 47Lee G.M. Johnstone B. Jacobson K. Caterson B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1899-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Erythrocyte particles were widely excluded from the region surrounding TNF-α-stimulated cells. But the pericellular matrix of TNF-α-stimulated cells was no longer evident after treatment of the cells with hyaluronidase, indicating that HA was the major component of this pericellular matrix. Importantly, such matrix-dependent erythrocyte exclusion was significantly higher in cells treated with TNF-α than in cells treated with TGF-β2 alone (Fig. 2A), whereas TGF-β2 alone could induce slight pericellular matrix formation. In contrast, immunoblot analysis revealed that stimulation with TGF-β2 alone as well as TNF-α alone for 3 days induced the expression of fibronectin (Fig. 2B). Although TGF-β2 induced a marked increase in fibronectin expression (Fig. 2B), it did not induce EAFD formation (Fig. 1, A and B). The data raised the possibility that fibronectin does not play a critical role in formation of EMT-associated deposits. Then, to investigate whether HA production is essential for the EMT, we used 4-MU, a well known inhibitor of HA synthesis (48Kosaki R. Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1141-1145PubMed Google Scholar, 49Sohara Y. Ishiguro N. Machida K. Kurata H. Thant A.A. Senga"
https://openalex.org/W2097287838,"Two critical stages of mammalian oocyte regulation are prophase I arrest, which is important for sustaining the oocyte pool, and the progression through meiosis I (MI) to produce fertilizable eggs. We have found that the spindle assembly checkpoint protein BubR1 regulates both stages in mouse oocytes. We show that oocytes depleted of BubR1 cannot sustain prophase I arrest and readily undergo germinal vesicle breakdown, a marker for reentry into MI. BubR1-depleted oocytes then arrest before completing MI, marked by failure of polar body extrusion. Both meiotic defects in BubR1-depleted oocytes are due to reduced activity of the master regulator known as the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), brought about through diminished levels of the APC coactivator Cdh1."
https://openalex.org/W2152546918,"Inserting Introns Introns—noncoding regions that interrupt coding gene sequences—are widespread throughout eukaryotic genomes, but intron gains and losses within and among species have been assumed to be rare. However, W. Li et al. (p. 1260 ) suggest that intron insertions can be relatively frequent within a population or species. By examining intron polymorphisms within genomes of different accessions of Daphnia pulpex (the water flea), and comparisons within the genus Daphnia , several instances of recent intron gains were observed, which appear to have occurred multiple times at the same site. Because intron insertions tend to be flanked by repetitive sequences, they may be the result of DNA damage repair mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2017272474,"Revealing the RNA World? The RNA World hypothesis posits that at an early step in the appearance of life, RNA acted both as an information storage molecule and as an enzyme—or ribozyme. Such dual functionality would allow for an RNA species that could replicate itself and thus seed the beginning of molecular evolution. The involvement of RNA in a number of fundamental cell biological processes, together with its ability, either naturally or through in vitro evolution, to catalyze a range of chemical reactions, provides some indirect support for this view. Shechner et al. (p. 1271 ) have now determined the structure of an in vitro–evolved RNA ligase ribozyme that catalyses a chemical reaction essentially identical to that of proteins that replicate RNA. The active site of the RNA ligase could be superimposed upon that of the protein enzyme to reveal analogous residues important for the catalytic joining of RNA moieties. These findings will help in the engineering of more effective ribozyme polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W1995420150,"Life Histories to Suit Nematode worms can profoundly manipulate their life histories in several ways. For example, Caenorhabditis elegans has two genders: males and hermaphrodites. Some clues for the evolution of this peculiar mating system have been revealed by Baldi et al. (p. 1002 ), who turned females of a related species, Caenorhabditis remanei , into hermaphrodites by modifying a gene involved in making sperm and another gene required for activating the spermatids. In most animals, the germ line is fully established during adulthood and a reproductive period is determined, at least in part, by aging of the germ line and the viability of oocytes. The reproductive longevity of hermaphrodite C. elegans can be increased at least 15-fold by starvation. Angelo and Van Gilst (p. 954 , published online 27 August; see the Perspective by Ogawa and Sommer ) found that in starved worms, the germline component of the reproductive system is actively killed, with the exception of a small set of preserved stem cells. When the worms are able to feed again, these cells regenerate into an entirely new and functional germ line. But this is not all. Kim et al. (p. 994 , published online 1 October; see the Perspective by Ogawa and Sommer ) show that subsets of the complex mixture of structurally related molecules in dauer pheromone act via distinct G protein–coupled receptors either to initiate longterm effects on development and physiology by modulating the neuroendocrine axis, or to trigger short-term acute effects on behavior by altering neuronal responses."
https://openalex.org/W2099581596,"Targeting DNA Gyrase DNA gyrase, an enzyme that unwinds double-stranded DNA, is essential in bacteria, but missing in humans, and is thus an important antibiotic target. DNA gyrase is inhibited by the well-known fluoroquinolines and aminocoumarins antibiotics, as well as by symocyclinones—bifunctional antibiotics comprising an aminocoumarin and a polyketide group. Surprisingly, symocyclinones, unlike aminocoumarin inhibitors, do not inhibit DNA gyrase GTPase activity, but instead inhibit binding to DNA. Now Edwards et al. (p. 1415 ) use biochemical and structural studies to show that the two functional groups of the antibiotic bind in separate pockets on the gyrase. Each group is a relatively weak inhibitor that together potently inhibit DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W2019846233,"Phosphorylation of the activation loop is one of the most common mechanisms for regulating protein kinase activity. The catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase autophosphorylates Thr197 in the activation loop when expressed in Escherichia coli. Although mutation of Arg194 to Ala prevents autophosphorylation, phosphorylation of Thr197 can still be achieved by a heterologous protein kinase, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK1), in vitro. In this study, we examined the structural and functional consequences of adding a single phosphate to the activation loop of cAMP-dependent protein kinase by comparing the wild type C-subunit to the R194A mutant either in the presence or the absence of activation loop phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Thr197 decreased the Km by ∼15- and 7-fold for kemptide and ATP, respectively, increased the stability of the enzyme as measured by fluorescence and circular dichroism, and enhanced the binding between the C-subunit and IP20, a protein kinase inhibitor peptide. Additionally, deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry was used to compare the structural dynamics of these proteins. All of the regions of the C-subunit analyzed underwent amide hydrogen exchange at a higher or equal rate in the unphosphorylated enzyme compared with the phosphorylated enzyme. The largest changes occurred at the C terminus of the activation segment in the p + 1 loop/APE regions and the αH-αI loop motifs and leads to the prediction of a coordinated phosphorylation-induced salt bridge between two conserved residues, Glu208 and Arg280.

The protein kinase superfamily is one of the largest in the human genome and one of the most relevant to disease, and the protein kinases serve as major on/off switches for almost every pathway in the cell. However, most protein kinases are themselves also regulated by a strategic phosphate. Kinases are typically expressed in an inactive state and converted into a fully active form by the addition of a phosphate to the activation loop (1Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Here we address the global importance of this one activation loop phosphate. cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) 5The abbreviations used are: PKAcAMP-dependent protein kinasePDK1phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinaseH/DMShydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometryPKIprotein kinase inhibitorPKCprotein kinase CMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidWTwild typeMAPmitogen-activated protein. is one of the best understood members of the protein kinase superfamily and has served as a prototype in many ways. It belongs to the AGC group of protein kinases, and in addition to the general features it shares with all protein kinases, it shares many features unique to the AGC group including a conserved C-terminal tail (2Kannan N. Haste N. Taylor S.S. Neuwald A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1272-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In PKA, as with many kinases, phosphorylation of a threonine residue in the activation loop (Thr197) converts the enzyme from an inactive to an active state. The activation loop phosphate on Thr197 coordinates the active site by bridging the C-helix (His87), the catalytic loop (Arg165), β9 (Lys189), and the activation loop (Thr195) (see Fig. 1). As a general rule, kinases that require phosphorylation of their activation loop contain an arginine preceding the catalytic aspartate (Asp166 in PKA) (3Johnson L.N. Lewis R.J. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2209-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Additionally, the DFG motif (residues 184–186) has been shown to be highly dynamic in many kinases and important for activation by coordinating Mg2+ at the active site, as well as for stabilizing the C-helix through a hydrophobic spine (4Kornev A.P.

Biol. 2005; 351: 956-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Lastly, there is a conserved APE motif (residues 206–208) at the C-terminal end of the activation segment. The function of this conserved region has not been well characterized. cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry protein kinase inhibitor protein kinase C 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid wild type mitogen-activated protein. Early studies showed qualitatively that Thr197 phosphorylation was important for binding to protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) (8Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shuntoh H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in yeast the C-subunit was shown to be defective in binding the R-subunit when the activation loop was not phosphorylated (9Levin L.R. Zoller M.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 1066-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A kinetic study of a T197A mutant demonstrated the significance of having a phosphate on the activation loop (10Adams J.A. McGlone M.L. Gibson R. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2447-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In a separate study, analysis of a kinase dead mutant of PKA (K72H) showed long range effects on the structure using hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (H/DMS) (11Iyer G.H. Garrod S. Woods Jr., V.L. Taylor S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the K72H mutation prevented phosphorylation in both the activation loop as well as the turn motif, such that the effects of phosphorylation could not be isolated from the effects of the lysine mutation. The effects of activation loop phosphorylation in other AGC kinases have also been studied both biochemically (12Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol.

For the conventional protein kinase C isoenzyme, PKCβII, activation loop phosphorylation plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity of the enzyme (12Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas for the novel isoenzyme, PKCδ, phosphorylation does not appear to be important for catalytic activity (13Stempka L.

Graham C. Shaw S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12102-12111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). There is also structural variation. In the absence of phosphorylation, the C-helix of PDK1 remains in an active conformation (15Komander D. Kular G. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18797-18802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas in Akt2, the C-helix is almost completely disordered (16Huang X. Begley M. Morgenstern K.A. Gu Y. Rose P. Zhao H. Zhu X. Structure. 2003; 11: 21-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). GRK2, on the other hand, does not contain the conserved Ser/Thr on the activation loop and thus does not require phosphorylation for activity (17Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The majority of these studies have been carried out by mutating the phosphorylation site to an alanine residue. The challenge is to develop an easily reversible system where one can compare the same protein in its phosphorylated state and in its dephosphorylated state. PKA, like many kinases, is complicated further because there are two phosphorylation sites: Thr197 on the activation loop and Ser338 in the turn motif. In bacteria, Thr197 is autophosphorylated by another C-subunit molecule (trans-phosphorylation), whereas Ser338 is autophosphorylated by an intramolecular (cis) mechanism following phosphorylation of the activation loop (19Iyer G.H. Moore M.J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8800-8807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, PKA is likely phosphorylated by PDK1 or a PDK1-like enzyme (20Cauthron R.D. Carter K.B. Liauw S. Steinberg R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 1416-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Cheng X. Ma Y. Moore M. Hemmings B.A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9849-9854Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). All of the structures of PKA to date correspond to the fully phosphorylated enzyme. In some cases the enzyme is inactive because it is bound to an inhibitor. To study the functional consequences of a single phosphate on the activation loop of the PKA C-subunit, we replaced an arginine residue in the activation loop with an alanine (R194A). This P-3 arginine is required for PKA substrate recognition (see Fig. 1). Arg194 does not have any known function but allows PKA to autophosphorylate Thr197 when expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli. After Arg194 is replaced with alanine, Thr197 is no longer autophosphorylated. The R194A mutant is stable for expression in bacteria, and Thr197 can be readily phosphorylated by PDK1 in vitro. Here, we demonstrate that Ser338 is still autophosphorylated in the R194A mutant. Thus, we are able to purify an inactive form of the C-subunit that can be converted readily into a fully active enzyme by PDK1. This mutant protein provides a good experimental model to precisely quantify the effects of adding a single phosphate to PKA. By comparing the catalytic efficiency, stability, and interaction with an inhibitor, we found that all of the regions of the protein are profoundly affected. These conclusions were confirmed by using H/DMS to map solvent-accessible sites. Both N-lobe (residues 1–126) and active site peptides showed enhanced deuteration. Most striking, however, was the complete exposure of the region surrounding the APE motif (residues 199–211) at the end of activation loop; this same region is well protected in the fully phosphorylated enzyme. In all cases the properties of the unphosphorylated R194A protein reverted to those of the wild type protein following phosphorylation by PDK1. This is the first demonstration showing that the addition of a single phosphate can have such a profound and global effect on the structure and function of protein kinase A. It also suggests that phosphorylation of the activation loop may be linked in PKA to an “APE-flip” mechanism. The reagents used were the pET15b expression vector (Invitrogen), E. coli strains BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI), QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences), SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminiscent substrate detection kit (Pierce), and oligonucleotides (Sigma). Antibodies against the catalytic subunit of PKA and the Ser338 phosphorylation site were described previously (19Iyer G.H. Moore M.J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8800-8807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas antibodies that specifically recognize the phosphorylated activation loop of PKC, referred to as α-Thr(P)197, were a gift from A. Newton (University of California, San Diego). DNA sequencing was performed with the ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other materials were reagent grade from standard commercial sources. His6-tagged R194A mutants in pET15b vector (ampr) were expressed in E. coli (BL21 (DE3)). Mid-exponential cultures of BL21 cells were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown for another 12 h at 16 °C prior to harvesting at 6000 rpm. Following resuspension in lysis buffer (50 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0), the cells were lysed using a Microfluidizer (Microfluidics) at 18,000 p.s.i. The cells were clarified by centrifugation at 17,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman JA20 rotor for 50 min, and the supernatant was incubated with ProBond Resin (Invitrogen) and pre-equilibrated in the same buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was then spun down at 3000 rpm, and the supernatant was removed. Two washes with the lysis buffer were followed by two washes with wash buffer (50 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm or 1 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7). An imidazole elution buffer using four different concentrations of imidazole (50, 100, 200, and 500 mm) in wash buffer was used to elute the His-tagged protein. Samples containing the most protein were loaded onto a prepacked Mono-S 10/10 (GE Healthcare) cation exchange column equilibrated in 20 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm KCl, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.15, and then eluted with equilibration buffer containing a KCl gradient ranging from 0 to 1 m. To obtain the phosphorylated form of R194A, the cells were co-expressed with PDK1 enzyme cloned in PGEX and Thr197-phosphorylated R194A (pR194A) was purified using the same approach as R194A. Amberlite MB-150 (Sigma) mixed bed exchanger was added to 8.0 m urea solution and stirred for 1 h to remove ionic urea degradation products. The urea solution was filtered and frozen at −20 °C. Proteins (0.12 mg/ml) were unfolded in various concentrations of urea ranging from 0 to 6 m for 0.5 h at room temperature and monitored by steady-state fluorescence. Fractional unfolding curves were constructed assuming a two-state model and using FU = 1 − [(R − RU)/(RF − RU)], where FU is the fraction of the unfolded protein, R is the fluorescence measurement, and RF and RU represent the values of R for the folded and unfolded states, respectively (22Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar). For unfolding monitored by fluorescence, R is the observed ratio of intensity at 356/334 nm with excitation at 295 nm. Thermal unfolding measured by circular dichroism was carried out as described previously (11Iyer G.H. Garrod S. Woods Jr., V.L. Taylor S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity was measured spectrophotometrically as described previously (23Cook P.F. Neville Jr., M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski Jr., R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The Km values for ATP and peptide substrate were determined using Michaelis-Menten kinetics. 75 nm C-subunit was pre-equilibrated in 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.3 mm NADH, lactate dehydrogenase (12 units), and pyruvate kinase (4 units) in a final volume of 100 μl. The reactions were initiated by adding various amounts of Kemptide (LRRASLG). All of the measurements were made in triplicate. The Km and Vmax were determined from a Hanes-Woolf plot. To form N-terminal fluorescently tagged IP20, 900 μm of IP20 (PKI5–24) and 9 mm of 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (Molecular Probes) in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, were mixed overnight at 4 °C. Labeled IP20 was purified by high pressure liquid chromatography with a 20–60% acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid on a C18 reverse phase column (Vydac). The mass of the labeled peptide was verified by mass spectrometry on a Voyager DE-STR matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (Applied Biosystems). Fluorescence polarization experiments were performed at 25 °C in a Costar 96-well solid black microplate (Corning) with a GeniosPRO microplate reader (Tecan). To determine the apparent Kd for FLU-IP20, serial dilutions of PKA or PKA mutants were made in assay buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.002% Triton X-100, 8 mm MgCl2, and 250 μm or 2 mm ATP. To these solutions was added FLU-IP20 to a final concentration of 1 nm, and the binding reaction was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in the dark. Readings were taken after 30 min, because no change in polarization was observed after 15 min, indicating that the binding reaction had reached equilibrium. The samples were excited at 485 nm, and emission in the parallel and perpendicular directions was detected at 535 nm. The polarization value measured for each sample was based on the average of 10 reads each with a 40-μs integration time. The data sets were fit to a sigmoidal dose response by nonlinear regression with GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA). Deuterium exchange analysis of the catalytic subunit was carried out as described previously (24Yang J. Garrod S.M. Deal M.S. Anand G.S. Woods Jr., V.L. Taylor S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with the following changes. The wild type and R194A mutant C-subunits were at 2.5 mg/ml final concentration in the deuterium exchange buffer. Back exchange was estimated to be 20% based on comparison with previously published analysis of the C-subunit (11Iyer G.H. Garrod S. Woods Jr., V.L. Taylor S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Yang J. Garrod S.M. Deal M.S. Anand G.S. Woods Jr., V.L. Taylor S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To evaluate the importance of the activation loop phosphate, we expressed and purified a mutant form of the PKA catalytic subunit that cannot be autophosphorylated as was described previously (25Moore M.J. Kanter J.R. Jones K.C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47878-47884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The consensus sequence for PKA substrates is shown in Fig. 1. Because the P-3 arginine is required for PKA substrate recognition, the R194A mutation makes it defective in autophosphorylation. Our first step was to evaluate the phosphorylation state of the R194A mutant using phospho-specific antibodies. We confirmed that the purified protein was not phosphorylated on Thr197 (Fig. 2). The enzyme, however, was not defective in its ability to autophosphorylate Ser338. Thus, the only difference between this mutant and the wild type catalytic subunit is a single phosphate on Thr197. In vitro, PDK1, but not wild type C-subunit, was able to phosphorylate the R194A mutant. The kinetic effects of adding phosphate to the PKA activation loop were measured for the first time without mutating the phosphorylation residue Thr197. In Table 1, the steady-state kinetics of the unphosphorylated mutant is compared with the wild type C-subunit. In the unphosphorylated state there were 15- and 7-fold increases in the Km for kemptide and ATP, respectively, compared with the phosphorylated state. The kcat, however, was not significantly affected by phosphorylation. Following the phosphorylation of R194A by PDK1, the steady-state kinetic parameters were nearly identical to the wild type C-subunit, confirming that the arginine mutation itself does not play a role in catalysis.TABLE 1Comparison of steady-state kinetic parameters for WT C-subunit and pR194A and R194A mutants measured on kemptide by the method of Cook et al.

To measure interactions between the C-subunit and PKI, we labeled a 20- amino acid peptide, corresponding to residues 5–25 of PKI (IP20) with fluorescein and used fluorescence anisotropy to measure its affinity for the different C-subunits. The presence of a phosphate resulted in a 9-fold increase in affinity between the C-subunit and IP20 (Fig. 3). The EC50 was 6.4 and 6.2 nm for the wild type and pR194A, respectively, and 54 nm for the R194A. The unfolding of the C-subunit was measured by monitoring the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence from 300–450 nm (excitation at 295 nm) with increasing urea concentration. There is a ∼15-nm shift in λmax when the C-subunit is unfolded in urea (Fig. 4A). The wild type C-subunit had a transition point of 3 m urea compared with 2.8 m for pR194A and 2.4 m for R194A (Fig. 4B). We also used circular dichroism to evaluate the global conformational state in the presence and the absence of ligands. Both Mg/ATP and H89 increased the thermostability of the C-subunit with or without phosphate; however, the unphosphorylated enzyme (R194A) was less stable than the phosphorylated enzymes (WT and pR194A) in each case (Table 2).TABLE 2Thermal denaturation (Tm (°C)) as an indicator of protein stability measured by CD spectroscopyLigandApoATPH89WT46.952.554.2pR194A46.551.353.3R194A41.344.847.1 Open table in a new tab To resolve structural and dynamic changes that occur as a result of Thr197 phosphorylation, we used H/DMS. The results showed that the presence of the phosphate was sensed in the small lobe, in the active site cleft, and in the large lobe (see supplemental Fig. S1 for peptide coverage map and supplemental Fig. S2 for complete H/DMS analysis). Nearly all of the peptides in the small lobe showed an increase in solvent accessibility in the R194A mutant, whereas the pR194A mutant was nearly identical to WT. The Gly-rich loop (residues 41–54) is a good indicator of the conformational state of the small lobe. Three peptides, including the Gly-rich Loop, identified in all three proteins are mapped onto the PKA structure in its apo conformation (26Akamine P. Madhusudan Wu J. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L.F.

The solvent accessibility of each peptide was reduced to wild type levels when the mutant protein was phosphorylated by PDK1. The DFG motif (residues 184–186) is an indicator of the activation state of the enzyme for many protein kinases (4Kornev A.P. Haste N.M. Taylor S.S. Eyck L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The DFG peptide (residues 182–186) showed rapid deuterium exchange (<10 s) in the unphosphorylated state, but exchange was slowed to 5 min in the phosphorylated state (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. S3). The catalytic loop peptide (residues 163–172) showed an increase in solvent accessibility, exchanging five deuterons in the unphosphorylated state and only three deuterons in the phosphorylated state after 50 min in deuterium. The largest changes in solvent accessibility occur near the end of the activation segment in the p + 1 loop/APE motif (199–211) and the αH-αI loop (278–296) peptides (Fig. 6), which are linked through a salt bridge (Glu208/Arg280). In the 199–211 peptide, the phosphorylated enzyme is well protected from solvent up to 50 min in deuterium, whereas the unphosphorylated enzyme exchanges roughly all of its amide hydrogens after only 5 min in deuterium. The 278–296 peptide exchanged four deuterons more in the unphosphorylated protein than in the phosphorylated protein after 30 s in deuterium. Although much of the molecule shows increased solvent accessibility in the unphosphorylated state, there remains a solid helical core that does not exchange deuterons with the solvent (Fig. 7). The αE and αF helices are buried within the core of the C-subunit, whereas the αC, αH, and αJ helices, although exposed to the solvent, show equally slow rates of deuterium exchange. Almost every protein kinase is regulated by phosphorylation of its activation loop. The PKA C-subunit is phosphorylated rapidly and constitutively in mammalian cells by a PKA kinase, most likely a PDK1-like kinase (20Cauthron R.D. Carter K.B. Liauw S. Steinberg R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 1416-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Cheng X. Ma Y. Moore M. Hemmings B.A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9849-9854Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated catalytic subunit is then regulated by four R-subunit isoforms that are in turn controlled by the second messenger, cAMP. This is in contrast to other kinases such as MAP kinases and protein-tyrosine kinases that are controlled by dynamic and transient activation loop phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Other AGC kinases, such as PKC, are also regulated by second messengers. The activation loop phosphate of PKA is resistant to phosphatases which is, in part, due to its close proximity to a cysteine residue in the activation loop (27Humphries K.M. Deal M.S. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2750-2758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The effects of activation loop phosphorylation have not been well studied in the AGC kinases without mutating the phosphorylated residue. The results shown here demonstrate for the first time the consequences that result from adding a single phosphate to the activation loop of the PKA catalytic subunit. Previous attempts to study the effects of activation loop phosphorylation have generally been carried out by replacing the phosphorylation site with either an alanine for Ser/Thr protein kinases or a phenylalanine for tyrosine protein kinases. Here, we generated a mutant form of the catalytic subunit that does not autophosphorylate Thr197, which we were then able to phosphorylate by co-expression with PDK1. This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing the R194A mutation as a model system for studying the effects of PKA activation loop phosphorylation. The phosphorylated mutant (pR194A) is similar to the wild type enzyme in stability, catalytic efficiency, ability to bind IP20, and solvent accessibility. There was a measurable difference in every property that was tested when comparing the C-subunit in the presence and absence of phosphorylation, including enhanced binding to a physiological inhibitor, increased thermodynamic stability, and a ∼15-fold increase in catalytic efficiency. Additionally, there were many regions throughout the protein that showed increased solvent accessibility in the unphosphorylated enzyme, most significantly in the p + 1 loop/APE region. In the case of PKA, a mutation of the phosphorylated residue (Thr197) to an alanine had a much more severe effect on the catalytic activity (10Adams J.A. McGlone M.L. Gibson R. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2447-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The T197A mutant had a catalytic efficiency that was ∼500-fold worse than the wild type C-subunit compared with ∼15-fold for the R194A mutant. This indicates that the hydroxyl group of the threonine residue may play a significant role in stabilizing the active site, and mutating the phosphorylation site to alanine may not be an appropriate method for studying the effects of activation loop phosphorylation. Thus, our goal was to quantify the effects of activation loop phosphorylation without mutating the phosphorylation residue. It was also shown previously and qualitatively that activation loop phosphorylation enhances binding to PKI (8Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shuntoh H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate quantitatively that there is a ∼10-fold increase in affinity between the C-subunit and IP20 when the activation loop is phosphorylated. Moore et al. (25Moore M.J. Kanter J.R. Jones K.C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47878-47884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), previously found that the E208A mutant in the APE motif blocked PDK1-mediated phosphorylation but did not block autophosphorylation. The structure of PKA in its active state showed that Glu208 is completely buried, making it difficult to explain how a mutation of E208A could block phosphorylation by another kinase. Additionally, Torkamani et al. (28Torkamani A. Kannan N. Taylor S.S. Schork N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9011-9016Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) recently identified a conserved ion pair (Glu208/Arg280 in PKA) as a disease “hot spot” in a number of protein kinases. Our H/DMS analysis shows that this APE region (peptide 199–211) is very well protected from solvent in the phosphorylated enzyme but exchanges all of its amide hydrogens with the solvent in the unphosphorylated state within 5 min. Several recently solved crystal structures from diverse protein kinases (including checkpoint kinase 2, Ste20-like kinase, lymphocyte-originated kinase, and death-associated protein kinase 3) (29Pike A.C.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3179-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) have revealed that the p + 1 loop/APE motif has the capacity to undergo large conformational changes. Our deuterium exchange analysis is the first indication that the p + 1 loop/APE motif from an AGC kinase is a highly dynamic region that may undergo large conformational changes in the absence of activation loop phosphorylation. This conformational change may make the activation loop more accessible so that phosphorylation by another kinase, such as PDK1, can occur. H/DMS has been used previously to analyze the C-subunit of PKA, and several mutations were found to increase the solvent accessibility of the αH-αI loop (11Iyer G.H. Garrod S. Woods Jr., V.L. Taylor S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Yang J. Garrod S.M. Deal M.S. Anand G.S. Woods Jr., V.L. Taylor S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Residues 282–286 form a loop that is specific to the AGC kinases (2Kannan N. Haste N. Taylor S.S. Neuwald A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1272-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Our data also show that the αH-αI loop becomes more solvent-exposed in the unphosphorylated enzyme, and we propose that this is a consequence of the APE conformational change. The only direct interaction between the activation segment and the αH-αI loop is through a salt bridge formed between Glu208 in the APE motif and Arg280 in the αH-αI loop. It is likely that Thr197 phosphorylation stabilizes this Glu208/Arg280 salt bridge. This ion pair is conserved in all protein kinases with the exception of the casein kinases. H/DMS has also been used to study two other protein kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) and p38 MAP kinase, in the presence and absence of activation loop phosphorylation (33Lee T. Hoofnagle A.N. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 600-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 34Sours K.M. Kwok S.C. Rachidi T. Lee T. Ring A. Hoofnagle A.N. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 1075-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Neither protein showed a large change in solvent accessibility in the region around the APE motif (a one- or two-deuteron difference), and correspondingly, there was relatively little change in the αH-αI loop peptide. Thus, the solvent accessibility changes in the APE and αH-αI loop regions may be more pronounced in PKA and in other AGC kinases that have a unique and conserved insert in the αH-αI loop. The deuterium exchange analysis also revealed several helices that do not exchange amide hydrogens with the solvent. The αE and αF helices are buried within the hydrophobic core of the protein, whereas the αC, αH, and αJ helices are at the surface of the enzyme where they are partially exposed to solvent. Nevertheless, many of the backbone amides within these helices appear to form highly stable hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl oxygens, which prevents any deuterium exchange from occurring. In contrast, the αA helix exchanges 90% of its amide hydrogens by 50 min in deuterium. These data also indicate that the loss of stability in the unphosphorylated mutant is not due to a change in the hydrophobic core of the protein. More likely, it is the dynamic change in the loop regions, in particular the p + 1 loop/APE motif and the αH-αI loop, that decreases the stability. The effect on stability was not as severe as that seen with the K72H mutant, which, in addition to the lysine mutation, was lacking both Thr197 and Ser338 phosphorylation (11Iyer G.H. Garrod S. Woods Jr., V.L. Taylor S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have made a biophysical comparison of two physiological states of the PKA catalytic subunit and have identified several novel properties associated with activation loop phosphorylation. Based on our kinetic analysis, the Thr197 hydroxyl group may be important for stabilizing the active site in the absence of phosphorylation because it is more active than simply replacing the threonine with alanine. More importantly, whereas the core of the protein remains stable in the absence of phosphorylation, the loop regions are highly dynamic. Most significantly, the dynamics of the APE motif and αH-αI loop, two regions that are linked by a conserved ion pair and are known to be associated with many diseases, are strongly dependent on the phosphorylation state of the activation loop.

https://openalex.org/W2069173965,"As in other eukaryotes, plant plasma membranes contain sphingolipids, phospholipids, and free sterols. In addition, plant plasma membranes also contain sterol derivatives and usually <5 mol% of a galactolipid, digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG). We earlier reported that compared to fully fertilized oats (Avena sativa), oats cultivated without phosphate replaced up to 70 mol% of the root plasma membrane phospholipids with DGDG. Here, we investigated the implications of a high DGDG content on membrane properties. The phospholipid-to-DGDG replacement almost exclusively occurred in the cytosolic leaflet, where DGDG constituted up to one-third of the lipids. In the apoplastic (exoplasmic) leaflet, as well as in rafts, phospholipids were not replaced by DGDG, but by acylated sterol glycosides. Liposome studies revealed that the chain ordering in free sterol/phospholipid mixtures clearly decreased when >5 mol% DGDG was included. As both the apoplastic plasma membrane leaflet (probably the major water permeability barrier) and rafts both contain only trace amounts of DGDG, we conclude that this lipid class is not compatible with membrane functions requiring a high degree of lipid order. By not replacing phospholipids site specifically with DGDG, negative functional effects of this lipid in the plasma membrane are avoided.-Tjellström, H., Hellgren, L. I., Wieslander, A., Sandelius, A. S. Lipid asymmetry in plant plasma membranes: phosphate deficiency-induced phospholipid replacement is restricted to the cytosolic leaflet."

The Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART) (available on the World Wide Web) predicts the existence of a large superfamily of proteins that contain domains (referred to as ShKT domains in the SMART data base) resembling these two toxins (Fig. 1A). Many of these proteins (∼70 proteins) are metallopeptidases, whereas others are prolyl-4-hydroxylases, tyrosinases, peroxidases, oxidoreductases, or proteins containing epidermal growth factor-like domains, thrombospondin-type repeats, or trypsin-like serine protease domains (Fig. 1B). The only human protein containing a ShKT domain in the SMART data base is MMP23 (matrix metalloprotease 23). Matrix metalloproteases belong to the metzincin superfamily and play important roles in tissue remodeling, development, and the immune response (19.Page-McCaw A. Ewald A.J. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Mol.

We have investigated MMP23 to gain insight into the structure and physiological functions of ShKT toxin domains and describe the solution structure of the MMP23TxD domain, its structural similarity to the sea anemone toxins BgK and ShK, and its functional role in blocking K+ channels. We synthesized the 37-residue rat MMP23TxD on RamageTM resin using an automated protocol. Fmoc-amino acids (Bachem AG) included Arg(2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulfonyl), Asp(tributyl ester), Cys(trityl), Gln(trityl), His(trityl), Lys(t-butoxycarbonyl), Ser(t-butyl), Thr(t-butyl), Trp(t-butoxycarbonyl), and Tyr(t-butyl). Stepwise assembly was carried out on a 0.25- mmol scale on a Symphony automated peptide synthesizer using O-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate activation and standard Fmoc-solid phase peptide synthesis methods. Following chain assembly, 800 mg of resin was cleaved using reagent K/trifluoroacetic acid (1:9) for 2 h at room temperature (27.King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 36: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Resin was filtered, and the peptide was precipitated using diethyl ether. The yield was 350 mg of peptide. The peptide was prepurified to ∼75% using preparative RP-HPLC (Kromasil-C18 10u) and lyophilized. Purification of 250 mg yielded 40 mg of semipure material, which was folded by dissolving the reduced and prepurified peptide in DMSO and then diluting to 0.25 mg/ml with 10% DMSO, 10% isopropyl alcohol, 2 m guanidine HCl and adjusting the pH to 7.6 with NH4OH. The solution, which remained clear during the pH adjustment, was then allowed to oxidize overnight. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry samples were taken at 2, 4, 6, and 24 h. Two peaks with the correct mass formed initially, but with longer reaction times, one peak became dominant. After 36 h, the folding was stopped by acidifying the solution with HCl to a pH of 4.0. The solution was diluted 50% with H2O and filtered before preparative HPLC purification over an reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography C18 column using a gradient of 15–45% B in 45 min (buffers A and B were 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O and acetonitrile, respectively). Mass spectral analysis determined the (M + H) to be 4427, consistent with the formation of three intramolecular disulfide bonds. The final yield of 26 mg was at a purity of 95%. Synthetic MMP23TxD (6 mg) was dissolved in 600 μl of H2O containing 6% 2H2O, and the pH was adjusted to 5.0. Two-dimensional homonuclear total correlation (TOCSY) spectra with a spin-lock time of 70 ms, nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOESY) spectra with mixing times of 250, 150, and 50 ms, and double quantum-filtered correlation (DQF-COSY) spectra were acquired at 600 MHz on a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer. Spectra were acquired at 20 °C unless otherwise stated and referenced to dioxane (3.75 ppm). TOCSY and NOESY spectra were also collected at 5 °C. The water resonance was suppressed using the WATERGATE pulse sequence (28.Palmer A.G. Cavanagh J. Wright P.E. Rance M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 151-170Google Scholar, 29.Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenár V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar). A series of one-dimensional spectra over the temperature range 5–25 °C, at 5 °C intervals, was collected. Amide exchange rates were monitored by dissolving freeze-dried material in 2H2O at pH 5.2 and then recording a series of one-dimensional spectra, followed by 70-ms TOCSY, 50-ms NOESY, and an exclusive correlation (E-COSY) spectra, all at 5 °C. In addition, 1H-13C HSQC spectra for the assignment of 13C chemical shifts and a 1H-15N HSQC spectrum for the assignment of 15N chemical shifts (28.Palmer A.G. Cavanagh J. Wright P.E. Rance M. J.

Diffusion measurements were performed at 5 and 20 °C using a pulsed field gradient longitudinal eddy-current delay pulse sequence (31.Gibbs S.J. Johnson Jr., C.S. J. Magn.

Spectra were processed using TOPSPIN (version 1.3, Bruker Biospin) and analyzed using XEASY (version 1.3.13) (34.Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). 3JHNHA coupling constants were measured from DQF-COSY spectra at 600 MHz and then converted to dihedral restraints as follows: 3JHNHα > 8 Hz, ϕ = −120 ± 40°; 3JHNHα < 6 Hz, ϕ = −60 ± 30°. χ1 angles for some residues were determined based on analysis of a short mixing time (50 ms) NOESY spectrum. In addition, TALOS (35.Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar) was used to predict torsion angle (ϕ and ψ) restraints based on chemical shifts. Predicted ϕ and ψ angles of residues that gave good prediction scores (17 residues: 12–16, 22–25, and 27–34) were constrained (range ± 40°) in structural calculations in XPLOR. Two χ1 angles (Asp5 and Phe36) were constrained in final structure calculations. The number of final dihedral angle constraints is listed in supplemental Table S1, and details have been deposited along with distance constraints in BioMagResBank (36.Seavey B.R. Farr E.A. Westler W.M. Markley J.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) as entry 15900. Because disulfide bonds for MMP23TxD had not been mapped, these were not included as structural restraints in preliminary calculations. Subsequently, disulfide bond connectivities were determined based on CysAHα-CysBHβ and CysAHβ-CysBHβ intercysteine NOEs observed in NOESY spectra (37.Klaus W. Broger C. Gerber P. Senn H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) as well as CysACβ–CysBCβ and CysASγ–CysBSγ intercysteine distance calculations in preliminary structures (supplemental Table S4). Disulfide bonding was determined to be Cys3-Cys37, Cys10-Cys30, Cys19-Cys34, which is the same pattern as in ShK and BgK. These were added as restraints for final structure calculations. No hydrogen bond restraints were included. Intensities of NOE cross-peaks were measured in XEASY and calibrated using the CALIBA macro of the program CYANA (version 1.0.6) (38.Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 171-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). NOEs providing no restraint or representing fixed distances were removed. The constraint list resulting from the CALIBA macro of CYANA was used in XPLOR-NIH to calculate a family of 200 structures using the simulated annealing script (39.Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). The 55 lowest energy structures were then subjected to energy minimization in water; during this process, a box of water with a periodic boundary of 18.856 Å was built around the peptide, and the ensemble was energy-minimized based on NOE and dihedral restraints and the geometry of the bonds, angles, and impropers. From this set of structures, final families of 20 lowest energy structures were chosen for analysis using PROCHECK-NMR (40.Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar) and MOLMOL (41.Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). In all cases, the final structures had no experimental distance violations of >0.2 Å or dihedral angle violations of >5°. The structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (42.Berman H.M. Battistuz T. Bhat T.N. Bluhm W.F. Bourne P.E. Burkhardt K. Feng Z. Gilliland G.L. Iype L. Jain S. Fagan P. Marvin J.

Kv1.6 (in pcDNA3.1) was transiently transfected with pEGFP-C1 in COS7 cells for 24–30 h. COS7 cells were grown to 60–80% confluence in 6-well culture plates and were transfected with 0.4–1 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM I medium as per the manufacturer's protocol. After 24–30 h, transfection efficiency was assessed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus). eGFP-MMP23 was generated using the following PCR primers: 5′ primer, 5′-CCCAAGCTTCCATGGGATGGCGAGCATGTCTCCGTCCGGAGGCGTC-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-GATGGATCCGAATTCTCAGCTCCTCACTCGGACCCTCCAGGA- 3′. Two-step PCR amplification was performed using rat MMP23 cDNA as template (Open Biosystems). The 1200-bp PCR product was inserted into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) at 5′ HindIII and 3′ BamHI restriction sites. The ligated product was transformed into XL1-blue Escherichia coli. The purified construct was used for transient transfection after sequence confirmation. pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-MMP23 along with hKv1.3 or hKv1.6 cDNA (in pcDNA3.1) were also co-transfected into COS7 cells (ratio 8:1), which were then trypsinized after 24 h, plated on coverslips, and followed by electrophysiological studies. Fluorescent cells were patch-clamped for outward potassium currents. Stable cell lines expressing Kv1.2, Kv1.7, and Kv1.3 were transfected with pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-MMP23 for suppression experiments. Expression of constructs in COS7 cells was confirmed by Western blot. All experiments were conducted in the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique, as described previously (1.Aiyar J.

COS7 cells transiently co-transfected with eGFP or eGFP-MMP23 and hKv1.3, or Kv1.2-expressing cells transfected with eGFP-C1 or eGFP-MMP23, were allowed to stick to poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated coverslips for 1 h prior to fixing (2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma)) and permebilization (0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline). Coverslips were blocked overnight with 5% bovine serum albumin plus 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were incubated with primary rabbit polyclonal anti-Kv1.3 antibodies (gift from Dr. Hans Gunther Knaus) (1:1000) for 2 h followed by secondary anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa 647 (Molecular Probes) for 1 h. For ER co-localization experiments, COS7 cells transfected with EGFP-C1 or eGFP-MMP23 were stained with anti-SERCA2 monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Molecular Probes) and secondary anti-mouse IgG-Alexa 647 (1:1000; Molecular Probes). Nonspecific rabbit IgG controls were performed for each experiment. All incubations were performed in the dark. Cells were imaged by confocal microscopy (LSM Zeiss Meta 2). Images were analyzed for co-localization using LSM 510 software (n = 3 independent experiments; 20–30 cells were imaged for quantification of co-localization). For flow cytometric studies to determine surface Kv1.3 channels using ShK-F6CA, the MMP23 construct from pEGFP-C1 was subcloned into pdsRED-C1 monomer (Clontech) at 5′ HindIII and 3′ BamHI restriction sites. We then co-transfected COS7 cells with human Kv1.3 and pDsRED-C1 (Clontech) or pDsRED-MMP23 for 30 h. Cells were trypsinized and incubated with 10 nm ShK-F6CA (44.Beeton C. Wulff H. Singh S.

The intensity of ShK-F6CA staining (a measure of Kv1.3 cell surface expression) was determined by flow cytometric analysis (FACSCalibur flow cytometer and BD CellQuest Pro software, BD Biosciences). The D value, a measure of the difference in mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) of stained and unstained cells, was calculated as follows. D=(MFIStained cells−MFIUnstainedcells)/MFIUnstained cells(Eq. 1) The MMP23 ShKT domains (henceforth referred to as MMP23TxD) from humans to hydra exhibit remarkable sequence conservation with no gaps or insertions in the domain (Fig. 2A). We compared the MMP23TxD sequence with that of sea anemone toxins as well as representative members of the ShKT domain family from worms, cnidarians, and plants (Fig. 2, B and C). We included in the sequence alignment a second human protein, microfibril associated protein MFAP2, with an ShKT domain that is not mentioned in the SMART data base (45.Faraco J. Bashir M.

When compared with sea anemone toxins, MMP23TxDs appear most similar to BgK with identical or equivalent substitutions at 14 of 36 positions (Fig. 2B). Asp5 is conserved in all members of the ShKT domain family but is absent in the ICR domains of CRISPs (Fig. 2C). In ShK, the carboxylate of this aspartate (Asp5 in ShK) forms a salt bridge with the ϵ-ammonium group of Lys30, and this salt bridge is necessary for proper folding of the peptide (18.Tudor J.E. Pallaghy P.K. Pennington M.W. Norton R.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 51.Tudor J.E. Pennington M.W. Norton R.S. Eur. J.

Lys32 and Arg32 at the equivalent position in MMP23TxDs from sea anemone, hydra, rat, mouse, and puffer fish (Fig. 2A) could form a salt bridge with the aspartate. Other MMP23TxDs contain Ser32 (Fig. 2A), and in these domains, Asp5 may make hydrogen bonding interactions with the side chain hydroxyl or the peptide backbone. In the multiple sequence alignment, most proteins, with the exception of the three snake CRISPs, contain a serine or threonine at position 33 (Fig. 2C). All sea anemone toxins contain a lysine residue (Lys25 in BgK, Lys22 in ShK) that occludes the K+ channel pore (16.Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J. Cotton J. Jamin N. Gilquin B. Roumestand C.

Four MMP23TxDs (opossum, chicken, zebra finch, stickleback fish) contain lysine at the corresponding position, whereas other vertebrate MMP23TxDs contain arginine (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, ICR domains of three snake CRISPs (natrin, triflin, and stecrisp) possess the critical pore-occluding lysine (Fig. 2C), and natrin has been reported to block the voltage-gated Kv1.3 channel (46.Wang F.

Phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-46 is indispensable for the commitment to apoptotic cell death. A previous study has shown that upon exposure to genotoxic stress, DYRK2 translocates into the nucleus and phosphorylates p53 at Ser-46, thereby inducing apoptosis. However, less is known about mechanisms responsible for intracellular control of DYRK2. Here we show the functional nuclear localization signal at N-terminal domain of DYRK2. Under normal conditions, nuclear and not cytoplasmic DYRK2 is ubiquitinated by MDM2, resulting in its constitutive degradation. In the presence of proteasome inhibitors, we detected a stable complex of DYRK2 with MDM2 at the nucleus. Upon exposure to genotoxic stress, ATM phosphorylates DYRK2 at Thr-33 and Ser-369, which enables DYRK2 to escape from degradation by dissociation from MDM2 and to induce the kinase activity toward p53 at Ser-46 in the nucleus.

DYRK2 shares a conserved kinase domain and adjacent N-terminal DH box but does not contain a C-terminal PEST (the proline-, glutamic acid-, serine- and threonine-rich) domain. DYRK2 is presumed to be involved in regulating key developmental and cellular processes such as neurogenesis, cell proliferation, cytokinesis, and cellular differentiation.

Upon exposure to genotoxic stress, p53 is stabilized and activated by phosphorylation at Ser-15 and Ser-20 to regulate a cell cycle checkpoint and DNA repair. In case of the lesion for irreparable DNA damage, p53 induces apoptotic cell death by a mechanism in which an additional phosphorylation increases the binding affinity of p53 to promoters of pro-apoptotic genes, such as p53AIP1. In this context previous studies have established the mechanism in which p53 transactivates p53AIP1 by its additional phosphorylation at Ser-46; thereby, this phosphorylation is essential for p53-dependent apoptosis (6Oda K.

These findings provide a novel signaling mechanism in which phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-46 by DYRK2 regulates apoptotic cell death in response to DNA damage. Although certain insights are, thus, available regarding the signals that activate p53-mediated apoptosis, less is known about the mechanisms responsible for the intracellular regulation of DYRK2 in response to genotoxic stress. The present findings provide a model in which ATM phosphorylates and activates DYRK2 to induce apoptotic cell death. ATM phosphorylates DYRK2 at Thr-33 and Ser-369. Intriguingly, nuclear DYRK2 is constitutively degraded by MDM2-mediated ubiquitination, and phosphorylated DYRK2 is dissociated from MDM2, resulting in the nuclear accumulation of DYRK2 in response to DNA damage. These findings collectively support an essential role for ATM in the intracellular control of DYRK2. U2OS cells, which express p53 wild type, were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. 293T, HCT116, and GM 5849 (11Peretz S.

Cells were treated with 2 μg/ml adriamycin (Sigma), 10 μm etoposide (Sigma), MG-132 (carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal; Nacalai Tesque), or cycloheximide (Merck). DYRK2 cDNA was amplified by PCR using the Expand high fidelity plus PCR system (Roche Applied Science) from the HL-60 cDNA library and cloned into the pcDNA3-FLAG vector and pEGFP-C1 vector as previously described (8Taira N.

Plasmid DNA was transfected by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or by calcium phosphate co-precipitation (15Yoshida K. Komatsu K. Wang H.G. Kufe D. Mol. Cell.

Transfection of siRNAs was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 or Lipofectamine RNAi MAX (Invitrogen). Cells were washed with chilled phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in lysis buffer (18Shinagawa H. Miki Y. Yoshida K. Antioxid.

Cell extracts were centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated anti-phospho-Ser/Thr ATM/ATR substrate (anti-phospho-SQ/TQ; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-p53(Ser-15) (Cell Signaling Technology), mouse anti-phospho-p53(Ser-46) (provided by Dr. Yoichi Taya), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-GFP (Nacalai Tesque), anti-tubulin (Sigma), anti-lamin B1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-ATM (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-DYRK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-His (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-MDM2 (Merck), or anti-GST (Nacalai Tesque). Immune complexes were incubated with secondary antibodies and visualized by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C, and then the beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and boiled for 5 min. Co-precipitates were eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma) as needed. Immunofluorescence analyses were performed as described elsewhere (20Yoshida K. Wang H.G. Miki Y. Kufe D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1431-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 21Yoshida K. Yamaguchi T. Natsume T. Kufe D. Miki Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of ATM, lysates were incubated with anti-ATM (Merck) for 2 h at 4 °C followed by 1 h of incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). The immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and then with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). As a substrate, recombinant GST-p53 or His-DYRK2 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Millipore, respectively. Immunoprecipitates were incubated in kinase buffer with substrates and ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. Samples were boiled for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In vitro ubiquitination assays were performed by incubating with His-DYRK2 (Millipore), GST-ubiquitin (Merck), rabbit E1 (Merck), GST-UbcH5b (Merck), and GST-MDM2 (Abnova) in ubiquitination buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.05 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase). The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction products were eluted using MagExtractor-His-tag (Toyobo). Cells were cultured poly-d-lysine coated 4-well chamber slides (BD Biosciences). Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assays using DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL system (Promega). For cells expressing GFP-tagged proteins, Cy5-dUTP (GE Healthcare) was used for the detection of the DNA strand breaks (22Liu H. Lu Z.G. Miki Y. Yoshida K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8480-8491Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 23Kimura J. Nguyen S.T. Liu H. Taira N. Miki Y. Yoshida K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5250-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cell fractionation assays were performed as described with minor modification (24Yamaguchi T. Kimura J. Miki Y. Yoshida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33943-33948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Yamaguchi T. Miki Y. Yoshida K. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 2088-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A recent study has shown that DYRK2 is targeted to the nucleus after genotoxic stress exposure (8Taira N. Nihira K. Yamaguchi T. Miki Y. Yoshida K. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 725-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar); however, a molecular mechanism of nuclear translocation remains unclear. In this regard, the finding that nuclear accumulation of DYRK2 is independent of its kinase activity indicates the possibility that there are some potential nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in DYRK2. Indeed, there are several potential NLS sequences that are conformed from the clusters of basic amino acids in both N-terminal and C-terminal regions (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the N-terminal and/or C-terminal domains containing these amino acid sequences are required for nuclear translocation of DYRK2, we constructed N-terminal or C-terminal deletion mutants of DYRK2 (DYRK2ΔN or DYRK2ΔC, respectively) (Fig. 1A). U2OS cells were transfected with GFP-DYRK2 or deletion mutants, then treated with DNA-damaging agent etoposide for 24 h. Immunostaining with anti-GFP revealed that, as reported previously, DYRK2 is predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm in control cells and moves into the nucleus after genotoxic stress (Fig. 1, B and C). Comparable translocation was observed in cells transfected with DYRK2ΔC (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, DYRK2ΔN was dominantly retained in the cytoplasm even after etoposide stimulation (Fig. 1, B and C), suggesting that N-terminal region of DYRK2 is required for its nuclear targeting in response to DNA damage. To confirm the impairment of DYRK2ΔN on nuclear accumulation after genotoxic stress, we performed subcellular fractionation assays. The results demonstrated that full-length DYRK2 moved into the nucleus after another DNA-damaging agent adriamycin (ADR) exposure (Fig. 1D). In contrast, DYRK2ΔN remained in the cytoplasm even in damaged cells (Fig. 1D), indicating that the N-terminal region including potential NLS sequence is essential for nuclear accumulation of DYRK2. To further determine whether the putative NLS motif at the N terminus is required for nuclear localization of DYRK2, mutations were introduced into the core NLS motif (GFP-DYRK2(KKR→NNN) Fig. 1A). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that GFP-DYRK2(KKR→NNN) was dominantly expressed in the cytoplasm and that there was no significant nuclear translocation after etoposide stimulation (Fig. 1, B and C). Similar results were obtained from subcellular fractionation assays (Fig. 1D). These findings suggest that this NLS motif is functional for the nuclear targeting of DYRK2 in response to DNA damage. A recent study has also demonstrated that ATM activates nuclear DYRK2 after genotoxic stress (8Taira N. Nihira K. Yamaguchi T. Miki Y. Yoshida K. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 725-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In this context, it is plausible that ATM is involved in nuclear targeting of DYRK2. To address this hypothesis, GFP-DYRK2 was co-transfected together with scramble siRNA or ATM siRNA in U2OS cells that were left untreated or treated with etoposide. Analysis of immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that ATM was required for nuclear accumulation of DYRK2 after DNA damage (Fig. 2, A and B). Similar results were obtained in 293T cells (data not shown). To confirm these results, we performed similar experiments using A-T cells, which are GM 5849/pEBS7 (A-T fibroblast with empty vector only) and GM 5849/pEBS7-YZ5 (A-T fibroblast complemented with ATM cDNA) (11Peretz S. Jensen R. Baserga R. Glazer P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 1676-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As shown for ATM-depleted U2OS cells, DYRK2 was retained in the cytoplasm after etoposide stimulation in GM 5849/pEBS7 cells (Fig. 2C). By contrast, in GM 5849/pEBS7-YZ5 cells, DYRK2 accumulated in the nucleus upon exposure to etoposide, clearly indicating that ATM is required for nuclear localization of DYRK2 in response to DNA damage. Taken together with previous findings, these data indicate that ATM controls nuclear localization and activation of DYRK2 in response to DNA damage. The findings demonstrating ATM-dependent regulation of DYRK2 led us to determine whether ATM phosphorylates DYRK2. ATM belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase superfamily and preferably phosphorylates Ser/Thr adjacent to Gln (SQ or TQ). Upon exposure to DNA double strand breaks, ATM is rapidly activated to phosphorylate numerous substrates including p53 at Ser-15 (26Khanna K.K. Keating K.E. Kozlov S. Scott S. Gatei M. Hobson K. Taya Y. Gabrielli B. Chan D. Lees-Miller S.P. Lavin M.F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 398-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). To assess the kinetics of ATM activation in response to DNA damage, anti-ATM immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitro kinase assays with GST-p53 as a substrate. As expected, ATM was activated after early periods of DNA damage (Fig. 3A). Intriguingly, activity of ATM was sustained at least 24 h post-ADR stimulation, indicating the continuous activation of ATM in response to DNA damage. Given that ATM is a nuclear kinase, ATM phosphorylation of DYRK2 could be detected with delayed kinetics after DNA damage, as nuclear targeting and activation of DYRK2 occur at a later period after genotoxic stress (8Taira N. Nihira K. Yamaguchi T. Miki Y. Yoshida K. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 725-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To examine whether ATM phosphorylates DYRK2 in vitro, we performed in vitro kinase assays using His-DYRK2 as a substrate. Immunoblot analysis with anti-phospho-Ser/Thr ATM/ATR substrate (anti-phospho-SQ/TQ) revealed that there was no significant phosphorylation of DYRK2 by ATM in unstressed cells (Fig. 3B). By contrast, activation of ATM by treatment with ADR for 24 h was associated with modest phosphorylation of DYRK2 (Fig. 3B), indicating the possibility that ATM phosphorylates DYRK2 in cells upon exposure to genotoxic stress. To establish whether ATM is involved in DYRK2 phosphorylation, we performed similar experiments using transfected A-T cells. Immunoblot analysis with anti-SQ/TQ revealed that DYRK2 was phosphorylated in GM 5849/pEBS7-YZ5, but not GM 5849/pEBS7 cells, after treatment with ADR (Fig. 3C). This finding confirms ATM phosphorylation of DYRK2 in response to DNA damage. In this context, there are two SQ/TQ sequences in DYRK2 as potential phosphorylation sites by ATM (Fig. 3D). To determine phosphorylation sites, two potential amino acid residues were individually mutated to Ala (Fig. 3D). We also constructed the mutant that both residues are replaced with Ala (Fig. 3D). 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-DYRK2 wild type (wt) or mutants followed by stimulation with ADR for 24 h. Immunoblot analysis of anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates with anti-phospho-SQ/TQ demonstrated that DYRK2 was phosphorylated on SQ/TQ sites at 24 h post-stimulation (Fig. 3E). Moreover, phosphorylation of the T33A, S369A, or T33A/S369A double mutant was substantially impaired after genotoxic stress (Fig. 3E). These findings clearly indicate that ATM phosphorylates DYRK2 at Thr-33 and Ser-369 after exposure to DNA damage. To examine whether ATM phosphorylation of DYRK2 affects its kinase activity, we monitored phosphorylation levels of p53 at Ser-46, which is the only clarified DYRK2 substrate in cells (8Taira N. Nihira K. Yamaguchi T. Miki Y. Yoshida K. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 725-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). As expected from earlier work (8Taira N. Nihira K. Yamaguchi T. Miki Y. Yoshida K. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 725-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), Ser-46 was heavily phosphorylated in DYRK2 wt-expressed cells after ADR stimulation (Fig. 3E). Slightly less significant, but substantial phosphorylation of Ser-46 was observed in cells transfected with the DYRK2 T33A mutant. By sharp contrast, Ser-46 phosphorylation was attenuated in cells ectopically expressed with the DYRK2 S369A or the DYRK2 T33A/S369A mutant (Fig. 3E). These findings, thus, clearly demonstrate that the DYRK2 T33A mutant does not have much effect, whereas the DYRK2 S369A mutant substantially reduces the levels of phosphorylated Ser-46 of p53 either as a single or double mutant. Of note, it is conceivable that residual Ser-46 phosphorylation in the presence of mutant form of DYRK2 could be due to activation of endogenous DYRK2 in cells. To explore this possibility, 293T cells were transduced with the GFP-DYRK2 T33A/S369A mutant, which is resistant to the silencing by the DYRK2 siRNA (designated GFP-rDYRK2 T33A/S369A). Cells were then transfected with scramble siRNA or DYRK2 siRNA followed by treatment with ADR. Upon exposure to ADR, ectopic expression of the GFP-rDYRK2 T33A/S369A mutant was associated with substantial induction of p53 phosphorylation at Ser-46 (Fig. 3F). In contrast, the silencing of endogenous DYRK2 markedly attenuated Ser-46 phosphorylation, suggesting that the GFP-rDYRK2 T33A/S369A mutant has little if any activity on Ser-46 phosphorylation after DNA damage in cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ATM-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-369 is crucial for DYRK2 activation in response to DNA damage. To define the functional significance of DYRK2 phosphorylation by ATM, we focused on DYRK2-mediated apoptosis induction. Given the previous findings that DYRK2 induces p53-dependent apoptosis by phosphorylating p53 at Ser-46 (8Taira N. Nihira K. Yamaguchi T. Miki Y. Yoshida K. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 725-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), U2OS cells, which express wild type p53, were transfected with wild type or various mutants of GFP-DYRK2 plasmids. After etoposide stimulation, apoptotic cells were monitored by TUNEL assays. As a control, GFP-DYRK2 wt was co-transfected together with scramble siRNA or ATM siRNA. In concert with the level of Ser-46 phosphorylation by DYRK2, introduction of DYRK2 wt enhanced DNA damage-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4A). Less significant, but substantial induction of apoptosis was also observed in cells ectopically expressed with the DYRK2 T33A mutant (Fig. 4A). In contrast, expression with the DYRK2 S369A mutant or the DYRK2 T33A/S369A mutant was associated with much less apoptosis induction compared with that with DYRK2 wt (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained in HCT116 cells (data not shown). These results demonstrated that ATM-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-369 is crucial for DYRK2-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Intriguingly, the finding that knocking down ATM attenuated induction of apoptosis after etoposide stimulation further supports a mechanism in which phosphorylation of DYRK2 by ATM is required for DNA damage-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4A). To confirm whether the activation of DYRK2 by ATM augments apoptosis in a p53-dependent fashion, HCT116/p53−/− cells were co-transfected with GFP-DYRK2 wt or the GFP-DYRK2 T33A/S369A mutant and FLAG vector, FLAG-p53 wt, or the FLAG-p53 S46A mutant in which Ser-46 is substituted with Ala. Cells were then treated with or without etoposide for 24 h. The analysis of TUNEL assays demonstrated that treatment of cells with etoposide induced apoptotic cell death (Fig. 4B). Importantly, co-expression of p53 wt and DYRK2 wt significantly enhanced apoptosis elicited by etoposide. By contrast, ectopic expression of the DYRK2 T33A/S369A mutant together with p53 wt attenuated apoptosis induction (Fig. 4B). Moreover, there was little if any augmentation of apoptosis in p53 S46A-expressing cells (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained in SaOS2 cells (data not shown). To confirm these findings in A-T cells, GFP-DYRK2 wt or the GFP-DYRK2 T33A/S369A mutant were transfected into cells in the absence or presence of etoposide. Apoptotic induction was significantly attenuated in ATM-complemented A-T cells ectopically expressed with the DYRK2 T33A/S369A mutant compared with that with DYRK2 wt (Fig. 4C). By sharp contrast, there was no remarkable difference on apoptosis induction between DYRK2 wt and the DYRK2 T33A/S369A mutant in A-T cells (Fig. 4C). These findings provide a model in which, upon exposure to genotoxic stress, ATM activates DYRK2 by phosphorylation, resulting in the exertion of p53 phosphorylation at Ser-46. This process renders cells more sensitive to p53-mediated apoptosis in a Ser-46 phosphorylation-dependent manner. Previous studies demonstrated that knock down of ATM attenuates DYRK2 expression at a post-translational mechanism (8Taira N. Nihira K. Yamaguchi T. Miki Y. Yoshida K. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 725-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of DYRK2 was increased in response to DNA damage. In this regard, it is conceivable that, upon exposure to genotoxic agents, ATM-dependent phosphorylation of DYRK2 protects its degradation, such as the ubiquitination and proteasomal system. To examine this possibility, 293T cells transfected with FLAG-DYRK2 wt were left untreated or treated with a proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates with anti-FLAG revealed that MG-132 treatment elevated DYRK2 expression (Fig. 5A). Intriguingly, up-regulation of DYRK2 was observed in the nucleus but not in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5A). To further obtain convincing evidence in the physiological condition, we assessed the expression status of endogenous DYRK2 with or without MG-132. Subcellular fractionation assays revealed that endogenous DYRK2 was stabilized in the nucleus but not in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5B). As a result, analysis of whole cell lysates indicated that total DYRK2 expression was increased in the presence of MG-132 (Fig. 5B). To confirm these findings, we performed the immunostaining experiments. U2OS cells were left untreated or treated with MG-132. DYRK2 was exclusively expressed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5C). In contrast, inhibition of proteasomal degradation was associated with substantial nuclear accumulation of DYRK2 (Fig. 5C). Nevertheless, it is still conceivable that DYRK2 expression is regulated by its half-life stability and is independent of proteasome-mediated degradation. To exclude this possibility, we examined the half-life of endogenous DYRK2 in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm. 293T cells were treated with an inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide. Subcellular fractionation assays demonstrated that cytoplasmic DYRK2 was constitutively stable at least 6 h after cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 5D). Intriguingly, nuclear DYRK2 was slightly decreased but was, however, substantially expressed even after inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these data demonstrate that nuclear DYRK2 is constitutively degraded by the proteasome-dependent pathway. A recent study showed that E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 controls the p53-signaling pathway including HIPK2 (27Rinaldo C. Prodosmo A. Mancini F. Iacovelli S. Sacchi A. Moretti F. Soddu S. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To determine whether degradation of DYRK2 is regulated by MDM2 and DNA damage abrogates MDM2-mediated proteolysis, FLAG-DYRK2 was ectopically expressed in 293T cells in the presence of MG-132. Analysis of anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates with anti-ubiquitin demonstrated that DYRK2 is polyubiquitinated, and this modification is completely abolished after ADR (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, the findings that DYRK2 interacted with MDM2 in unstressed cells and that the binding was abrogated after ADR treatment provide the possibility that an E3 ubiquitin ligase for DYRK2 is MDM2 (Fig. 6A). To address this possibility in vitro, purified DYRK2 was incubated with ubiquitin, E1, E2, and MDM2. Analysis with anti-ubiquitin demonstrated that DYRK2 is ubiquitinated by MDM2 in vitro (Fig. 6B). To confirm this in cells, 293T cells expressed with FLAG-DYRK2 were transfected with scramble siRNA or MDM2 siRNA followed by treatment with MG-132. Analysis of anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates with anti-ubiquitin from nuclear lysates demonstrated that the polyubiquitination of DYRK2 was impaired in cells depleted with MDM2 (Fig. 6C). To prove whether degradation of nuclear DYRK2 is MDM2 dependence, 293T cells transfected with GFP-DYRK2 were left untreated or treated with MG-132. DYRK2 was exclusively stained in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6D). However, inhibition of proteasome enabled DYRK2 to be also expressed in the nucleus (Fig. 6D). Importantly, depletion of MDM2 conferred nuclear localization of DYRK2 even in the absence of the proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 6D). To further assess the effect of MDM2 depletion on endogenous DYRK2 expression, 293T cells were transfected with scramble siRNA or MDM2 siRNA followed by treatment with MG-132. As expected, expression of endogenous DYRK2 increased after MG-132 treatment (Fig. 6E). Significantly, silencing of MDM2 allowed endogenous DYRK2 to be stabilized even in the absence of proteasome inhibitors, again suggesting that DYRK2 expression is controlled by MDM2 (Fig. 6E). Similarly, the finding that MDM2 depletion increased expression of exogenous DYRK2 in the absence of proteasome inhibitors confirms the involvement of MDM2 in DYRK2 expression (Fig. 6F). In addition, we have examined the role for MDM2 in DYRK2 expression before and after genotoxic stress. As shown for ADR, treatment of cells with etoposide, another DNA-damaging agent, also induced expression of DYRK2 (Fig. 6G, left two lanes). Importantly, knocking down MDM2 retrieved DYRK2 expression to a significant level even in unstressed condition (Fig. 6G, first lane versus third lane). These data support a model in which constitutive degradation of DYRK2 is, at least in part, in a MDM2-dependent manner and in which DNA damage abrogates MDM2-mediated degradation of DYRK2. To establish endogenous interaction between DYRK2 and MDM2, 293T cells were treated with MG-132. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-MDM2 followed by immunoblotting with anti-DYRK2. The results demonstrated a stable complex of MDM2 with DYRK2 in cells in the presence of proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 6H). To further establish dissociation of this complex after genotoxic stress, 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-DYRK2. As similarly shown in Fig. 6A, DYRK2 formed a complex with MDM2 in unstressed cells, and the complex formation was diminished after etoposide treatment (Fig. 6I). As a control, there was little if any DYRK2·MDM2 complex in cells silenced for MDM2 (Fig. 6I). To further define the role for ATM in the MDM2-dependent DYRK2 degradation, 293T cells were co-transfected with FLAG-DYRK2 and scramble siRNA or ATM siRNA. As expected, the DYRK2·MDM2 association was completely abrogated after DNA damage in control cells (Fig. 7A). By contrast, DYRK2 retained the binding to MDM2 even after ADR treatment in ATM-deficient cells (Fig. 7A). To determine whether ATM phosphorylation of DYRK2 is involved in the dissociation from MDM2, 293T cells were transfected with DYRK2 wt, the DYRK2 T33A mutant, the DYRK2 S369A mutant, or the DYRK2 T33A/S369A mutant in the presence of MG-132. Analysis of anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates with anti-ubiquitin demonstrated that the DYRK2 T33A mutant and the T33A/S369A mutant, but not wild type or the S369A mutant, remained polyubiquitinated even after ADR stimulation (Fig. 7B). In concert with this result, the DYRK2 T33A mutant and the T33A/S369A mutant abrogated dissociation from MDM2 after DNA damage (Fig. 7B). These results provide a model in which ATM phosphorylation of DYRK2 at Thr-33 is, at least in part, associated with abrogation of MDM2 binding in the nucleus and thereby of ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation.FIGURE 7ATM is required for the escape from the degradation of DYRK2. A, 293T cells ectopically expressed with FLAG-DYRK2 were transfected with scramble siRNA or ATM siRNA and then left untreated or treated with ADR for 24 h in the presence of MG-132. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-agarose. Immunoprecipitates (IP) were subjected to immunoblot analysis (IB) with anti-MDM2 (top panel) or anti-FLAG (second panel). Lysates were also subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-ATM (third panel) or anti-tubulin (bottom panel). A ratio of MDM2 bound to DYRK2 was determined by the densitometric analysis using ImageJ program. The expression in unstressed cells transfected with scramble siRNA was defined as 1.00. B, 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-DYRK2 or the AQ mutants and then treated with ADR for 24 h in the presence of MG-132. Nuclear lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-agarose. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-ubiquitin (top panel), anti-MDM2 (second panel), or anti-FLAG (third panel). Lysates were also analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-MDM2 (fourth panel) or anti-lamin B1 (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DYRK2 is a requisite kinase for the induction of apoptosis by phosphorylating p53 at Ser-46 in response to DNA damage. Previous studies demonstrate that DYRK2 translocates into the nucleus where it phosphorylates p53 to initiate the apoptotic pathway (8Taira N. Nihira K. Yamaguchi T. Miki Y. Yoshida K. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 725-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Moreover, transfected DYRK2 induces p53-dependent apoptosis, whereas its depletion renders cells more resistant to p53-mediated apoptosis in a Ser-46 phosphorylation dependent manner. Intriguingly, ATM is necessary for stabilization and activation of DYRK2 after genotoxic stress. Indeed, expression of DYRK2 increases after DNA damage, whereas that is significantly reduced in cells silenced for ATM (8Taira N. Nihira K. Yamaguchi T. Miki Y. Yoshida K. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 725-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In this regard, the present study demonstrated that ATM phosphorylates DYRK2 at Thr-33 and Ser-369. Thr-33 phosphorylation was required for stabilization of DYRK2 because there was little if any increase after ADR exposure with the T33A mutant, at least in the overexpressing conditions (Fig. 3E). Given the finding that the potential NLS was localized near Thr-33 at the N-terminal region, it is conceivable that Thr-33 phosphorylation affects the NLS to trigger nuclear entrapment and stabilization of DYRK2. ATM-dependent stabilization of DYRK2 is also supported by the findings that ATM abrogated MDM2-mediated degradation of DYRK2 in the nucleus. The present data showed that nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, DYRK2 is constitutively degraded by MDM2-mediated polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal system (Fig. 8). Upon exposure to DNA damage, ATM phosphorylation of Thr-33 enabled DYRK2 to protect against MDM2-mediated degradation, possibly by dissociation of DYRK2 from MDM2 (Fig. 7B). Domains responsible for the binding of DYRK2 to MDM2 are presently unclear. Importantly, however, expression of DYRK2 with a T33A mutation abrogated disruption of binding to MDM2 and resulted in its destabilization at least in the overexpressing conditions. These findings indicate that ATM-dependent phosphorylation induces nuclear accumulation of DYRK2 by dissociating from MDM2 after genotoxic stress (Fig. 8). Taken together, it is less likely that cytoplasmic DYRK2 moves into the nucleus in response to DNA damage. Indeed, we observed relative increments of nuclear DYRK2 after ADR exposure but still found its substantial expression in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C). Instead, DYRK2 theoretically localizes in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm; however, constitutive degradation of nuclear DYRK2 in control cells seems predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm. After ADR stimulation, abrogation of MDM2 access to DYRK2 renders cells its substantial nuclear appearance. Previous studies have demonstrated that MDM2 is degraded by itself in response to genotoxic stress (28Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 29Honda R. Yasuda H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In this context it is also conceivable that the degradation of nuclear DYRK2 is, at least in part, attenuated by self-clearance of MDM2 after DNA damage. Until now, we cannot exclude the possibility that DYRK2 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Indeed, our study clarified the potential NLS of DYRK2 at the N-terminal region. However, it remains obscure whether this NLS is functional even in cells in the unstressed condition. This possibility is now under investigation. Our previous studies demonstrated that ATM is involved in DYRK2 activation in response to DNA damage, whereas a precise mechanism remains unclear (8Taira N. Nihira K. Yamaguchi T. Miki Y. Yoshida K. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 725-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The present study clarified that ATM phosphorylates DYRK2 at Thr-33 and Ser-369 upon exposure to genotoxic stress. Unfortunately, we are unable to show the direct phosphorylation of DYRK2 by ATM in vitro as, to our knowledge, purified active ATM protein is not available. Importantly, however, the findings that expression of DYRK2 with a S369A mutation significantly attenuated not only phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-46 but also ADR-induced apoptosis at least in the overexpressing conditions indicate the indispensable phosphorylation on Ser-369 for DYRK2 activation. In this context the present results that induction of apoptosis was attenuated by ectopically expressing the T33A mutant (Fig. 4A) suggest at least in part prerequisite for nuclear accumulation of DYRK2 on DNA damage-induced apoptosis. As shown previously, DYRK2-induced apoptosis was mediated by p53 phosphorylation at Ser-46. Moreover, given the findings that ATM controls DYRK2 activity, ATM could function as a pro-apoptotic kinase in response to genotoxic stress. In concert with this model, DNA damage-induced apoptosis was substantially abrogated in cells silenced for ATM (Fig. 4A). A proapoptotic role for ATM is currently controversial. Nevertheless, under our experimental conditions, ATM affects apoptotic execution by controlling DYRK2 expression and activation after DNA damage. Intriguingly, sustained exposure with DNA lesion is required for nuclear accumulation of DYRK2 after phosphorylation by ATM, mainly due to dissociation from MDM2. However, it remains uncertain why it takes considerably longer periods as p53 is rapidly stabilized after genotoxic stress. Obviously, further studies are needed to address these issues. We thank Y. Taya and S. Mizutani for providing anti-phospho-p53(Ser-46) antibodies and GM 5849 cells, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2024394279,"Membrane traffic between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes is mediated in part by the assembly of clathrin-AP-1 adaptor complex-coated vesicles. This process involves multiple accessory proteins that directly bind to the ear domain of AP-1gamma via degenerate peptide motifs that conform to the consensus sequence diameterG(P/D/E)(diameter/L/M) (with diameter being a large hydrophobic amino acid). Recently, gamma-BAR (hereafter referred to as Gadkin for reasons explained below) has been identified as a novel AP-1 recruitment factor involved in AP-1-dependent endosomal trafficking of lysosomal enzymes. How precisely Gadkin interacts with membranes and with AP-1gamma has remained unclear. Here we show that Gadkin is an S-palmitoylated peripheral membrane protein that lacks stable tertiary structure. S-Palmitoylation is required for the recruitment of Gadkin to TGN/endosomal membranes but not for binding to AP-1. Furthermore, we identify a novel subtype of AP-1-binding motif within Gadkin that specifically associates with the gamma1-adaptin ear domain. Mutational inactivation of this novel type of motif, either alone or in combination with three more conventional AP-1gamma binding peptides, causes Gadkin to mislocalize to the plasma membrane and interferes with its ability to render AP-1 brefeldin A-resistant, indicating its physiological importance. Our studies thus unravel the molecular basis for Gadkin-mediated AP-1 recruitment to TGN/endosomal membranes and identify a novel subtype of the AP-1-binding motif."
https://openalex.org/W2078317302,"Size differences account for a great deal of the diversity found in the animal kingdom, but we still have much to learn about how sizes are programmed. Generally, the cells of different animals are comparable in size, and all animals begin as a single cell. This leaves the number of cells accumulated as the main determinant of animal size. We can reasonably expect the genes controlling cell number to be conserved among animals. So it seems that size-determining genes must be deployed in the elephant in such a way that it amasses several hundred thousand times more cells than the mouse. Which are these genes and how do they control size? I asked this question in a more experimentally tractable context: How do body parts of a single animal become different sizes? Fingers, toes, and ribs are sets of structures whose members are similar in form but differ in size. Although we know that Hox transcription factors specify the identity of individual fingers, toes, and ribs, little is known about how their individual sizes are programmed."
