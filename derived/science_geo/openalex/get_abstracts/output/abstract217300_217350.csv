https://openalex.org/W89248094,The principle of animal population control through the use of sexually sterile males has been demonstrated for insects. Sexually sterile males that retain their sexual vigor and behavior will exert greater influence in regulating animal populations than can be achieved by destroying or removing the same number of individuals from the population. This hypothesis is supported by calculations showing theoretical population trends in assumed insect and animal populations subjected to treatments that destroy or eliminate certain percentages of the individuals as compared with a procedure that retains or replaces the same number of males in the population after sterilization. The maximum regulating effect that can be achieved is in direct proportion to the ratio of sterile to fertile males competing for mates. The advantages of inducing sexual sterility in a natural population of an insect species by chemical or other treatment over the method of rearing and releasing a dominating population of sterile males are considered. It is suggested that the sterile-male method may have practical application for undesirable populations of certain wild animals as well as for insects.

https://openalex.org/W2042327344,The rate of aerobic transformation of glucose-U-C(14) into radioactive amino acids by slices of rat-brain cortex is greatly influenced by the K(+)/Ca(++) ratio in the incubating medium. Protoveratrine has effects on the amino acid pattern resembling that due to an increase in the K(+)/Ca(++) ratio. These effects are antagonized by cocaine and may be correlated with the neurophysiological activities of these drugs.

The magnitude and sign of the potential are sensitive to the calcium concentration in the bath solution. Bubbling carbon dioxide through the solution bathing the shell side increased the potential."
https://openalex.org/W2063862007,A cooperative reinvestigation of the possibility that filtrates of crowngall bacterial cultures can induce autonomous tumors in plants has been conducted. The results indicate that the neoplasms formed after treatment do not fulfill the criteria for crown gall since they are not autonomous.

https://openalex.org/W1976661355,"An inward movement of choline can be demonstrated across isolated skins of Rana pipiens when the outside is bathed by a saline made with choline chloride. This is in contrast to an earlier report indicating that skins of R. esculenta are impermeable to choline. The flux was very small and independent of the active transport of sodium by the skins. For most experiments choline can be used as an ""inert"" replacement for sodium in this prepration."
https://openalex.org/W2023240623,"PHYSICAL studies1 indicate that solubilized collagens give rise to two components when heated gently (13°–40° C. depending on the source of the collagen)2 or when treated with other agents which break weak bonds. These two components have not been satisfactorily isolated3 by the methods used to fractionate4 ‘gelatine’, an end-product of more drastically altered collagen. We have succeeded in chromatographing warm dissolved rat tail tendon collagen into four components with a method which allows for the isolation of these components."

Unfortunately, there is almost no information concerning the effect of coumarin on the growth of micro-organisms5 and we have, therefore, carried out tests with Rhodotorula rosea."

Various experimental approaches, for example, the artificial perfusion of surviving liver with blood containing alcohol, oxidation of alcohol by liver slices and liver brei, diminished alcohol oxidation following either hepatectomy or damage to the liver, and the demonstration that the eviscerated animal metabolizes alcohol very slowly, have all indicated that the liver is of major importance in the metabolism of ethanol1."

https://openalex.org/W2012049149,"IT is well known that beech litter is less susceptible to decomposition than is the litter of many other species including maple. One reason for this may be the presence or absence of certain factors inhibiting or stimulating microbial growth. For example, factors inhibitory to various fungi have been shown to occur in leaf exudates of certain plants1 and in many plant extracts2,3,4, whereas factors stimulating certain mycorrhizal and saprophytic Hymenomycetes have also been observed3. Antibacterial factors have been demonstrated in extracts of oak and maple leaves5, spruce needles6, and in other species7. Autoclaving of the extract has been shown to increase the inhibition of fungi3 and bacteria5 under the experimental conditions used."

The dog, although readily available and a convenient source of relatively large volumes of plasma, has been utilized sparingly2. The present study was made in order that the haemopoietic factor might be determined in the dog following exposure of the animal to various experimental procedures which are known to affect production of the factor in other species."
