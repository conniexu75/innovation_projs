A hyperdirect pathway between the inferior frontal gyrus and subthalamic nucleus is hypothesized to mediate movement inhibition, but there is limited evidence for this in humans. We recorded high spatial and temporal resolution field potentials from both the inferior frontal gyrus and subthalamic nucleus in 21 subjects. Cortical potentials evoked by subthalamic stimulation revealed short latency events indicative of monosynaptic connectivity between the inferior frontal gyrus and ventral subthalamic nucleus. During a stop signal task, stopping-related potentials in the cortex preceded stopping-related activity in the subthalamic nucleus, and synchronization between these task-evoked potentials predicted the stop signal reaction time. Thus, we show that a prefrontal-subthalamic hyperdirect pathway is present in humans and mediates rapid stopping. These findings may inform therapies to treat disorders featuring perturbed movement inhibition.

Thus, we show that a prefrontal-subthalamic hyperdirect pathway is present in humans and mediates rapid stopping. These findings may inform therapies to treat disorders featuring perturbed movement inhibition. Stopping a movement that has already been initiated is critical for motor control. Movement inhibition is thought to be mediated by a “hyperdirect” monosynaptic pathway between the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) (Aron et al., 2007Aron A.R. Behrens T.E. Smith S. Frank M.J. Poldrack R.A. Triangulating a cognitive control network using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI.J.

In non-human primates, anterograde tracer studies demonstrate a lateral prefrontal projection to the ventral STN (Haynes and Haber, 2013Haynes W.I. Haber S.N.

Due to methodological constraints, however, there is limited evidence in humans that a monosynaptic IFG-STN pathway exists or that hyperdirect activation is involved in stopping. Tractography studies have identified white matter tracts between the IFG and STN (Aron et al., 2007Aron A.R. Behrens T.E. Smith S. Frank M.J. Poldrack R.A. Triangulating a cognitive control network using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 3743-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), although imaging lacks the ability to isolate pathways that are monosynaptic. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) studies have identified short-latency evoked potentials (EPs) in the frontal-central cortex elicited from STN stimulation, indicating monosynaptic connectivity (Ashby et al., 2001Ashby P. Paradiso G. Saint-Cyr J.A. Chen R. Lang A.E. Lozano A.M. Potentials recorded at the scalp by stimulation near the human subthalamic nucleus.Clin.

Disord. 2012; 27: 864-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, EEG lacks the spatial resolution to discern whether the pathway originates in the IFG or if it is a distributed pathway across the frontal-central cortex. Functionally, the IFG and STN are thought to be involved in stopping (Aron et al., 2016Aron A.R. Herz D.M. Brown P. Forstmann B.U. Zaghloul K. Frontosubthalamic Circuits for Control of Action and Cognition.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 11489-11495Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), but activity in this pathway has not yet been characterized with high spatiotemporal resolution. Initial functional imaging studies indicated that blood oxygenation in the STN region and IFG were modulated during a stop signal task. Single-site invasive electrophysiology studies showed that beta band (∼11–30 Hz) activity in the field potentials of the STN (Alegre et al., 2013Alegre M. Lopez-Azcarate J. Obeso I. Wilkinson L.

We used high-resolution, invasive electrophysiology in both the IFG and STN to characterize prefrontal hyperdirect topography and its functional relevance during stopping. In Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients undergoing awake neurosurgery for implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes, we used intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) targeted to the IFG and DBS electrodes targeted to the STN. We performed EP experiments to characterize monosynaptic connectivity, and we used the stop signal task to characterize stopping-related activity. Here, we provide physiological evidence for the existence of a prefrontal-subthalamic hyperdirect pathway in humans, show that the IFG and STN are tightly synchronized during stopping, and demonstrate that IFG-STN synchronization predicts stop signal reaction time (SSRT) across subjects. We enrolled 21 subjects with PD: 16 subjects participated in the EP experiments and 15 subjects performed the stop signal task (10 subjects participated in both) (Tables S1 and S2). EP data from 2 subjects were excluded due to technical failures. Stop signal task data from 5 subjects were excluded due to violation of the race model, in which unsuccessful STOP reactions times were greater than successful GO reaction times (Verbruggen et al., 2019Verbruggen F. Aron A.R. Band G.P. Beste C. Bissett P.G. Brockett A.T. Brown J.W. Chamberlain S.R. Chambers C.D. Colonius H. et al.A consensus guide to capturing the ability to inhibit actions and impulsive behaviors in the stop-signal task.eLife. 2019; 8: e46323Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Subjects were taken off dopaminergic medications for 12 h. The mean DBS electrode coordinates for the right STN, aligned to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line, were 10.7 ± 0.6 (lateral), −3.5 ± 1.7 (anterior-posterior), and −6.2 ± 1.4 (vertical). The coordinates for the left STN were −11.5 ± 0.7, −3.4 ± 1.1, −7.4 ± 1.5. The mean age of the subjects was 67.5 ± 6.3 years and the mean disease duration was 8.6 ± 3.4 years. We found evidence for a prefrontal-subthalamic hyperdirect pathway in humans by stimulating in the STN and examining antidromic evoked activity in the prefrontal cortex. Short-latency potentials in the cortex support the existence of a fast-conducting monosynaptic connection. Figure 1 illustrates evoked cortical activity in a single-subject example. Contacts were localized both with imaging (Figures 1A and 1B) and electrophysiology (Figure 1C). Bipolar stimulation in the right STN in the 2 most ventral STN contacts evoked activity in the ipsilateral ECoG after ∼2 ms (Figure 1D). Because the short-latency EP was small in amplitude, we summed the EPs elicited from 2 stimulation settings with reversed anode and cathode configurations, similar to previous EEG studies (Walker et al., 2012Walker H.C. Huang H. Gonzalez C.L. Bryant J.E. Killen J. Cutter G.R. Knowlton R.C. Montgomery E.B. Guthrie B.L. Watts R.L. Short latency activation of cortex during clinically effective subthalamic deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease.Mov. Disord. 2012; 27: 864-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We quantified the amplitude of the 2-ms EP to characterize the subthalamic and cortical topography of the hyperdirect pathway. We found that ventral STN stimulation elicited larger amplitude potentials than dorsal STN stimulation, suggesting stronger prefrontal-ventral STN connectivity (p = 4.0 × 10−6, Wilcoxon signed rank test; Figure 1E). Furthermore, greater EP amplitudes were found in channels covering the IFG regions compared to neighboring regions, suggesting stronger hyperdirect connectivity for the IFG than more distant cortical regions (Figure 1F). We ruled out artifactual contributions to this short-latency, low-amplitude event by manipulating stimulation and recording paradigms. Reversal of the stimulating anode and cathode reversed the stimulation artifact, but not the polarity of the EP (Figure 1G). We performed additional control experiments in 5 subjects. EPs scaled with stimulation current (Figure S1A) were invariant to the ECoG referencing scheme (Figure S1B), were not a cumulative effect of constant 10-Hz stimulation (Figure S1C), and did not arise from pallidal stimulation (Figure S1D). Across all of the subjects, we conducted matched analyses of EP latency, subthalamic topography, and cortical topography. The mean latency of the earliest cortical EP following STN stimulation was 2.2 ± 0.2 ms (Figure 2A). Ventral STN stimulation elicited larger-amplitude EPs than dorsal STN stimulation (p = 4.9 × 10−4, Wilcoxon signed rank test; Figure 2B). In the cortical regions that we covered, evoked responses were greatest in the IFG and the perisylvian region of the superior temporal lobe, with a tapering of amplitudes in peripheral regions (Figures 2C and S2). Hyperdirect EPs were elicited in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulated STN in subjects with left or right ECoG coverage. To compare evoked activity in both hemispheres, we evaluated EPs in a single subject who received both left and right ECoG during 2 separate surgeries (Figure S3A). We found similar evoked responses ∼2 ms after left and right STN stimulation, indicating that lateral projections to the STN are not strongly lateralized (Figure S3B). The latency of the evoked response was earlier on the right hemisphere than on the left (p = 5.9 × 10−4, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Figure S3C). Cortical topography was similar on both sides (Figure S3D), with the smallest evoked responses in contacts furthest from the IFG. Following the 2-ms potential, the next distinct cortical evoked event occurred 6.0 ± 0.35 ms after stimulation (Figure S4A). Even at this longer latency, conduction is still rapid enough to be mediated by retrograde activation of hyperdirect fibers, so we also assessed the topography of this longer latency potential. We found subjects in which the topography of the 6-ms potential clearly differed from that of the 2-ms potential, with larger amplitudes over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex than over the IFG, although in other subjects the topographies did not differ (see examples in Figure S4B). Across all of the subjects, the 6-ms potential was more broadly distributed across the prefrontal cortex (Figure S4C). This suggests that a more “diffuse” hyperdirect pathway from widespread prefrontal areas could use slightly smaller diameter axons, while the largest diameter, shortest latency fibers are relatively more restricted to the IFG-STN pathway (Figure 2C). To characterize the role of the prefrontal-subthalamic hyperdirect pathway in movement inhibition, subjects performed a visual stop signal task (Figure 3A). In 66% of trials, a left or right arrow cued a left or right button press, respectively (GO trials). In 33% of trials, a STOP cue followed the GO cue after a variable delay, signaling a halt in movement (STOP trials). Across all of the subjects, the mean GO trial accuracy was 86% ± 10% and the mean STOP accuracy was 66% ± 11% (Figure 3B). The mean GO reaction time was 779 ± 193 ms, the mean stop signal delay was 441 ± 209 ms, and the estimated SSRT was 384 ± 76 ms (Figure 3B). We generated event-related potentials (ERPs) of cortical- and STN-evoked activity during the task. After the STOP cue in successful STOP trials, ERP deflections appeared in both the cortex and STN after ∼200–300 ms (Figure 3C). To quantify the lag between cortical and subthalamic ERPs, we calculated the cross correlation (Figure 3D). Across subjects, the average cross-correlation lag between all of the cortical-STN channel pairs was −90 ± 131 ms, with the cortex leading the STN (p = 0.029, t test; Figure 3E). We validated our metric for prefrontal-STN lag by quantifying the temporal offset of cortical and STN ERPs with 1 alternative method. In ECoG and STN channels with distinct, matching ERP deflections, we calculated the difference in time between the deflection onset (maximum point in the upward deflection). Both calculations of cortico-STN ERP latency offset indicate that cortical activity precedes subthalamic activity during stopping (Figure 3E). Next, we asked whether the degree of circuit co-activation was linked to behavior. The mean prefrontal-subthalamic correlation across subjects was 0.46 ± 0.15 (Figure 3F). Across subjects, the degree of correlation was inversely related to the SSRT (p = 0.040, r = 0.65, Spearman correlation; Figure 3G), suggesting that greater hyperdirect circuit activity is linked to faster stopping. Although movement inhibition is impaired in PD (Gauggel et al., 2004Gauggel S. Rieger M. Feghoff T.A. Inhibition of ongoing responses in patients with Parkinson’s disease.J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 2004; 75: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), we did not find physiology or stopping behaviors to be correlated with parkinsonian severity: subjects’ total scores on the Unified PD Rating Scale were not correlated with the SSRT (p = 0.82, r = 0.084, Pearson correlation) or with cortico-STN correlation during stopping (p = 0.72, r = 0.13, Pearson correlation). Within subjects, we looked for physiological predictors of behavior that would differentiate between successful and failed STOP trials. We hypothesized 3 different models that could produce success versus failure: (1) IFG-STN activity is more correlated during successful stopping, (2) IFG-STN lag is shorter during successful stopping, and (3) IFG-STN activity is initiated more quickly during successful stopping. Within subjects, we did not find differences in cortico-subthalamic correlation (p = 0.73, t test; Figure S5A) or IFG-STN lag (p = 0.93, t test; Figure S5B) during successful versus failed stopping. We found that cortical ERPs during successful stopping preceded activity during failed stopping within subjects, with a mean lag of −12 ± 21 ms (p = 0.050, 1 sample t test; Figure S5C), suggesting that faster initiation of IFG-STN activity is important for successful stopping. Previous studies characterizing single-site activity in either the IFG or the STN during stopping have linked modulations of beta power to successful stopping (Alegre et al., 2013Alegre M.

We therefore conducted frequency domain analyses to characterize stopping-related oscillatory activity in the IFG and STN and stopping-related coherence between these structures. Figure 4A illustrates activity in a single cortical and a single STN channel for a sample patient. In single trials, delta activity in the IFG and STN increases immediately after the STOP cue. The onset of delta power modulation has a consistent temporal relationship with the onset of the STOP cue, and it does not appear after the GO cue (Figure S6A), suggesting that it is a modulation specific to the stopping process. Beta power decreases after the GO cue, and then increases after the STOP cue in the IFG and STN (Figures 4A and S6A). These delta and beta modulations were significant in the trial-averaged spectrograms (Figure S6). The increase in beta power occurred after the estimated time of stopping. Pooled activity across all of the subjects shows similar modulations in the grand average spectrograms (Figure 4B). We used the grand average spectrograms to characterize the cortical topography of stopping-related activity. In the regions covered, the IFG had the greatest task-related delta and beta power (p < 0.05 multifactorial ANOVA, with post hoc Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) pairwise comparisons; Figure 4C). Since stopping-related delta activity in the frequency domain analyses is of short duration, it does not necessarily reflect an oscillatory phenomenon. This frequency domain modulation likely reflects the same ERP captured in the time domain. In support of this, task-evoked delta power was correlated with the amplitude of the ERP (p = 0.027, r = 0.17, Spearman correlation; Figure 4D). Finally, we asked whether beta modulations in IFG and STN, or coherent beta band interactions between IFG and STN, predicted stopping behaviors, either between or within subjects. Beta power at each site individually, quantified in the 13–30 Hz range and in 250-ms windows before and after the SSRT, was not predictive of SSRT (Bonferroni-corrected p > 0.05, Spearman correlation). Next, we analyzed beta in subject-specific narrow frequency bands, assessing beta amplitude and beta bursts in both the IFG and STN. Beta amplitude, burst rate, burst size, and burst duration (Hannah et al., 2019Hannah R. Muralidharan V. Sundby K.K. Aron A.R. Temporally-precise disruption of prefrontal cortex informed by the timing of beta bursts impairs human action-stopping.bioRxiv. 2019; https://doi.org/10.1101/843557Crossref Google Scholar) in both sites were not predictive of SSRT independently (Bonferroni-corrected p > 0.05, Spearman correlation) or in a combined multivariate regression model (p = 0.22, R2 = 0.35). Within subjects, these metrics also did not differentiate successful versus failed stopping (Bonferroni-corrected p > 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Furthermore, we did not find that beta amplitude or beta bursts were predictive of GO reaction times in either the IFG or STN (Bonferroni-corrected p > 0.05, Spearman correlation). Oscillatory coherence between the IFG and STN was also not predictive of SSRT in the beta band (p = 0.57, r = −0.21, Spearman correlation; Figure 4E) or in any other frequency range (Figure S7). We also looked for oscillatory interactions between IFG and STN by analyzing the power spectrum of the time-domain measure of synchronization discussed above, the cross correlation of the IFG and STN ERPs. These power spectra were calculated across all of the contact pairs and then averaged for each patient. We found some patients with a visible peak in the beta band, which is consistent with an oscillatory coherence between the prefrontal cortex and STN during stopping, although not all of the patients showed this peak (examples in Figure S8). However, there was no difference in SSRTs between patients with and without a beta peak (p = 0.062, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Thus, in this population of PD patients taken off dopaminergic medication, we did not find evidence for a relationship between beta modulation and stopping or going in this circuit. We used invasive brain recordings in PD patients to characterize the IFG-STN circuit and its activity during stopping. By stimulating in the STN and recording in the prefrontal cortex, we identified a fast EP that provides the first physiological evidence of hyperdirect (monosynaptic) connectivity between the IFG and ventral STN in humans. During a stop signal task, we showed correlated stopping-related evoked activity in both the IFG and STN, and the degree of co-activation of these structures is predictive of stopping speed across subjects. Although we did find increases in IFG and STN beta at the estimated time of stopping, beta coherence was not correlated with stopping speed. Our study is the first to show that the hyperdirect circuit co-modulation is linked to stopping behaviors, which has broad implications for stimulation-based therapies to treat maladaptive movement inhibition. The hyperdirect pathway was initially proposed to be a rapid connection from the motor cortical regions to the STN, bypassing the striatum and providing rapid modulation of basal ganglia output (Nambu et al., 2002Nambu A.

Subthalamic innervation from primary motor, supplementary motor, and premotor afferents was first identified in non-human primates using electrophysiological and histological techniques (Monakow et al., 1978Monakow K.H.

Neurosci. 2018; 38: 9129-9141Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the retrograde activation of a hyperdirect pathway. More recently, attention has focused on a possible prefrontal-subthalamic pathway and its role in the cognitive control of inhibition. Histological tracing in non-human primates has identified prefrontal projections to the STN, with a topography favoring more ventral regions of the STN (Haynes and Haber, 2013Haynes W.I. Haber S.N. The organization of prefrontal-subthalamic inputs in primates provides an anatomical substrate for both functional specificity and integration: implications for basal ganglia models and deep brain stimulation.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 4804-4814Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, there has been limited anatomic or physiological characterization of this pathway in humans. Our study is the first to use invasive electrodes at both the origin and the termination of the prefrontal-subthalamic hyperdirect pathway to show monosynaptic connectivity. Consistent with EP latencies reported in the EEG literature, we found an average latency of 2.2 ms for the earliest evoked event across all subjects. This EP likely reflects rapid axonal back-propagation, with a conduction time of ∼25 m/s, assuming a 5-cm distance between the prefrontal cortex and STN. These fibers are slower than the large axon fibers of the corticospinal tract, which have conduction velocities of 41 m/s (Ashby et al., 1998Ashby P. Strafella A. Dostrovsky J.O. Lozano A. Lang A.E.

This is consistent with rodent tract tracing studies, showing that corticospinal fibers that collateralize to the STN have smaller-diameter fibers than corticospinal axons that do not collateralize (Kita and Kita, 2012Kita T.

This article aims to provide an in-depth examination of the practices and perceptions of data management, including data storage, data sharing, and data use and reuse by scientists around the world.The Usability and Assessment Working Group of DataONE, an NSF-funded environmental cyberinfrastructure project, distributed a survey to a multinational and multidisciplinary sample of scientific researchers in a two-waves approach in 2017-2018. We focused our analysis on examining the differences across age groups, sub-disciplines of science, and sectors of employment.Most respondents displayed what we describe as high and mediocre risk data practices by storing their data on their personal computer, departmental servers or USB drives. Respondents appeared to be satisfied with short-term storage solutions; however, only half of them are satisfied with available mechanisms for storing data beyond the life of the process. Data sharing and data reuse were viewed positively: over 85% of respondents admitted they would be willing to share their data with others and said they would use data collected by others if it could be easily accessed. A vast majority of respondents felt that the lack of access to data generated by other researchers or institutions was a major impediment to progress in science at large, yet only about a half thought that it restricted their own ability to answer scientific questions. Although attitudes towards data sharing and data use and reuse are mostly positive, practice does not always support data storage, sharing, and future reuse. Assistance through data managers or data librarians, readily available data repositories for both long-term and short-term storage, and educational programs for both awareness and to help engender good data practices are clearly needed."
https://openalex.org/W3009593016,"The present study aimed to validate and compare the football-specific measurement accuracy of two optical tracking systems engineered by TRACAB. The ""Gen4"" system consists of two multi-camera units (a stereo pair) in two locations either side of the halfway line, whereas the distributed ""Gen5"" system combines two stereo pairs on each side of the field as well as two monocular systems behind the goal areas. Data were collected from 20 male football players in two different exercises (a football sport-specific running course and small-sided games) in a professional football stadium. For evaluating the accuracy of the systems, measures were compared against simultaneously recorded measures of a reference system (VICON motion capture system). Statistical analysis uses RMSE for kinematic variables (position, speed and acceleration) and the difference in percentages for performance indicators (e.g. distance covered, peak speed) per run compared to the reference system. Frames in which players were obviously not tracked were excluded. Gen5 had marginally better accuracy (0.08 m RMSE) for position measurements than Gen4 (0.09 m RMSE) compared to the reference. Accuracy difference in instantaneous speed (Gen4: 0.09 m⋅s-1 RMSE; Gen5: 0.08 m⋅s-1 RMSE) and acceleration (Gen4: 0.26 m⋅s-2 RMSE; Gen5: 0.21 m⋅s-2 RMSE) measurements were significant, but also trivial in terms of the effect size. For total distance travelled, both Gen4 (0.42 ± 0.60%) and Gen5 (0.27 ± 0.35%) showed only trivial deviations compared to the reference. Gen4 showed moderate differences in the low-speed distance travelled category (-19.41 ± 13.24%) and small differences in the high-speed distance travelled category (8.94 ± 9.49%). Differences in peak speed, acceleration and deceleration were trivial (<0.5%) for both Gen4 and Gen5. These findings suggest that Gen5's distributed camera architecture has minor benefits over Gen4's single-view camera architecture in terms of accuracy. We assume that the main benefit of the Gen5 towards Gen4 lies in increased robustness of the tracking when it comes to optical overlapping of players. Since differences towards the reference system were very low, both TRACAB's tracking systems can be considered as valid technologies for football-specific performance analyses in the settings tested as long as players are tracked correctly."
https://openalex.org/W3011335190,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) convert adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA. A-to-I editing of RNA is a widespread posttranscriptional process that has recently emerged as an important mechanism in cancer biology. A-to-I editing levels are high in several human cancers, including thyroid cancer, but ADAR1 editase-dependent mechanisms governing thyroid cancer progression are unexplored. To address the importance of RNA A-to-I editing in thyroid cancer, we examined the role of ADAR1. Loss-of-function analysis showed that ADAR1 suppression profoundly repressed proliferation, invasion, and migration in thyroid tumor cell models. These observations were validated in an in vivo xenograft model, which showed that ADAR1-silenced cells had a diminished ability to form tumors. RNA editing of miRNAs has the potential to markedly alter target recognition. According to TCGA data, the tumor suppressor miR-200b is overedited in thyroid tumors, and its levels of editing correlate with a worse progression-free survival and disease stage. We confirmed miR-200b overediting in thyroid tumors and we showed that edited miR-200b has weakened activity against its target gene ZEB1 in thyroid cancer cells, likely explaining the reduced aggressiveness of ADAR1-silenced cells. We also found that RAS, but not BRAF, modulates ADAR1 levels, an effect mediated predominantly by PI3K and in part by MAPK. Lastly, pharmacological inhibition of ADAR1 activity with the editing inhibitor 8-azaadenosine reduced cancer cell aggressiveness. Overall, our data implicate ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing as an important pathway in thyroid cancer progression, and highlight RNA editing as a potential therapeutic target in thyroid cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3012249945,"Neuron-immune interaction in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) plays a pivotal role in the neuropathic pain development after nerve injury. Sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) is expressed by DRG neurons but its role in neuropathic pain is not fully understood. We investigated the effect of peripheral Sig-1R on neuroinflammation in the DRG after spared (sciatic) nerve injury (SNI) in mice. Nerve injury induced a decrease in NeuN staining along with the nuclear eccentricity and ATF3 expression in the injured DRG. Sig-1R was present in all DRG neurons examined, and after SNI this receptor translocated to the periphery of the soma and the vicinity of the nucleus, especially in injured ATF3 + neurons. In WT mice, injured DRG produced the chemokine CCL2, and this was followed by massive infiltration of macrophages/monocytes, which clustered mainly around sensory neurons with translocated Sig-1R, accompanied by robust IL-6 increase and mechanical allodynia. In contrast, Sig-1R knockout (Sig-1R-KO) mice showed reduced levels of CCL2, decreased macrophage/monocyte infiltration into DRG, and less IL-6 and neuropathic mechanical allodynia after SNI. Our findings point to an important role of peripheral Sig-1R in sensory neuron-macrophage/monocyte communication in the DRG after peripheral nerve injury; thus, these receptors may contribute to the neuropathic pain phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W3012002136,"Sperm head shaping is a key event in spermiogenesis and is tightly controlled via the acrosome–manchette network. Linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complexes consist of Sad1 and UNC84 domain–containing (SUN) and Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 homology (KASH) domain proteins and form conserved nuclear envelope bridges implicated in transducing mechanical forces from the manchette to sculpt sperm nuclei into a hook-like shape. However, the role of LINC complexes in sperm head shaping is still poorly understood. Here we assessed the role of SUN3, a testis-specific LINC component harboring a conserved SUN domain, in spermiogenesis. We show that CRISPR/Cas9-generated Sun3 knockout male mice are infertile, displaying drastically reduced sperm counts and a globozoospermia-like phenotype, including a missing, mislocalized, or fragmented acrosome, as well as multiple defects in sperm flagella. Further examination revealed that the sperm head abnormalities are apparent at step 9 and that the sperm nuclei fail to elongate because of the absence of manchette microtubules and perinuclear rings. These observations indicate that Sun3 deletion likely impairs the ability of the LINC complex to transduce the cytoskeletal force to the nuclear envelope, required for sperm head elongation. We also found that SUN3 interacts with SUN4 in mouse testes and that the level of SUN4 proteins is drastically reduced in Sun3-null mice.

Spermiogenesis involves drastic morphological changes of spermatids, including acrosome formation, elongation and condensation of the nucleus, and disposal of residual cytoplasm, to differentiate into mature spermatozoa consisting of a head and a tail (1Jan S.Z. Hamer G. Repping S. de Rooij D.G. van Pelt A.M. Vormer T. Molecular control of rodent spermatogenesis.Biochim. Biophys.

During this complex process, a transient cytoskeletal structure called the manchette appears concurrently with spermatid nucleus elongation. The manchette, which is first evident in step 8 spermatids in mice (3O'Donnell L. O'Bryan M.K. Microtubules and spermatogenesis.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 30 (24440897): 45-5410.1016/j.semcdb.2014.01.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), is composed of parallel arrays of microtubules aligned with the long axis of the nucleus and a belt-like perinuclear ring made of actins where the microtubules are anchored, forming a sleeve-like structure that encircles the spermatid nucleus (4Kierszenbaum A.L. Spermatid manchette: plugging proteins to zero into the sperm tail.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2001; 59 (11468770): 347-34910.1002/mrd.1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 5Courtens J.L. Loir M.

It is believed that manchette microtubules emanate from perinuclear rings, as these microtubules appear from the post-acrosomal region in mouse and bovine spermatids (7Moreno R.D. Schatten G.

As spermatids differentiate, the microtubular structure and the perinuclear ring move caudally to the posterior pole of spermatid nucleus, sculpting the nucleus into a hook-like morphology. The important role of the manchette in sperm head shaping has been demonstrated in several studies in which disruption of manchette-related proteins resulted in various forms of sperm head abnormalities and eventually impaired male fertility. For example, loss of functional HOOK1 causes ectopic positioning of the manchette microtubular structure within spermatids, resulting in abnormal sperm head morphologies, such as club-shaped and crescent forms (8Mendoza-Lujambio I. Burfeind P. Dixkens C. Meinhardt A. Hoyer-Fender S. Engel W. Neesen J. The Hook1 gene is non-functional in the abnormal spermatozoon head shape (azh) mutant mouse.Hum. Mol.

Similarly, disruption of RIM-BP3, a HOOK1-interacting protein located in the manchette, also causes ectopic positioning of manchette and sperm head abnormalities similar to those of Hook1 mutant mice (9Zhou J.

The microtubule plus-end-tracking protein CLIP-170 localizes prominently to the manchette rings during manchette formation, and male mice with knockout of Clip-170 are subfertile because of defective sperm head shaping and abnormal elongation of the manchette tubules (2Lehti M.S. Sironen A.

Despite the essential role of the manchette in spermiogenesis, how the microtubule manchette is assembled and regulated remains poorly understood.

To investigate the physiological functions of Sun3 during mammalian spermatogenesis, we generated a Sun3 knockout mouse model using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology. We found that Sun3−/− male mice are infertile, displaying abnormal sperm head morphology and irregular acrosome localization, likely resulting from disruption of manchette assembly. These findings demonstrate that Sun3 is essential for sperm head shaping during spermiogenesis. Consistent with previous findings (14Göb E. Schmitt J. Benavente R. Alsheimer M.

To investigate the biological function of SUN3, we generated Sun3-null mice using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology (Fig. 1A). Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA from the mutant mice revealed that a thymidine was inserted between nucleotide position 184 and 185 (c.184_185insT) in exon 4 of Sun3, predicted to result in premature translation termination (p.Pro62Leufs*2) (Fig. 1B). Western blotting analyses further confirmed that full-length SUN3 proteins were absent in the testes of Sun3−/− mice (Fig. 1C and Fig. S2). Mice lacking Sun3 appeared normal, displaying no obvious abnormalities in development and behavior. Given the testis-restricted expression pattern of SUN3, we studied fertility in Sun3−/− male mice. Mating attempts of Sun3−/− males with WT females did not produce any offspring, indicating that Sun3−/− males are infertile. Sun3−/− females showed no overt abnormalities in fertility. Sun3−/− mice had smaller testes (Fig. 2, A and B) and sharply declined epididymal sperm numbers (0.17 ± 0.03 million/ml) compared with WT mice (12.80 ± 0.36 million/ml) (Fig. 2C). To further characterize the spermatogenic defects in Sun3−/− mice, H&E staining of testis and epididymis sections was performed. All types of spermatogenic cells were present in an orderly way in Sun3+/+ seminiferous tubules and mature spermatozoa, and a canonical hook-shaped head could be seen in the lumen of tubules (Fig. 2D, a and b). However, in Sun3−/− mice, all elongating and elongated spermatids as well as spermatozoa were observed to have a noncanonical round head (Fig. 2D, c and d). Consistent with the result of sperm counting per epididymis, the numbers of these noncanonical spermatids and spermatozoa were apparently lower in seminiferous tubules and in the cauda epididymides of Sun3−/− mice compared with those in Sun3+/+ mice (Fig. 2D, e and f). Furthermore, a TUNEL assay in combination with a germ cell–specific marker (MVH) was performed, and the results indicated apoptosis in cells with a small amorphous nuclear shape, which corresponds to the noncanonical spermatids in Sun3−/− mice (Fig. 2E). The frequency of TUNEL+ tubules (11.99% ± 0.75% versus 32.00% ± 3.17%) and the number of TUNEL+ cells per TUNEL+ tubule (1.70% ± 0.15% versus 2.52% ± 0.15%) in Sun3−/− mice were significantly increased compared with Sun3+/+ mice (Fig. 2F), suggesting that the spermatids of Sun3−/− mice underwent apoptosis. These results indicate that Sun3 is essential for spermatogenesis and particularly for the development of spermatids. We further analyzed the sperm morphology in the epididymis and found that, in contrast to the typical hook-shaped appearance of sperm heads in Sun3+/+ mice, all sperm heads in Sun3−/− mice were amorphous with a smaller and more rounded shape (Fig. 3, A and B). Additionally, ∼89.67% ± 2.02% of spermatozoa from Sun3−/− mice also displayed various midpiece defects, such as irregular caliber, bending, coiling, and/or cracking (Fig. 3, A and C, and Fig. S3). Immunofluorescence staining of peanut agglutinin (PNA), a marker of acrosomes, was performed on sperm smears and seminiferous tubules. In Sun3+/+ mice, acrosomes with a typical crescent shape were found on top of the nucleus in the anterior dorsal part of the sperm head. However, acrosomes of spermatozoa from Sun3−/− mice were missing, mislocalized, or fragmented (Fig. 3D). Because failure of sperm head elongation usually leads to a rounded head appearance, to understand the specific step at which head abnormalities occur in Sun3−/− mice, we compared spermatids of Sun3+/+ and Sun3−/− mice at different steps of spermiogenesis. PAS staining revealed that the morphology of spermatids until steps 7 and 8 were comparable in Sun3+/+ and Sun3−/− mice, indicating that the development of round spermatids was normal in Sun3−/− mice (Fig. 4). At step 9, the nuclei of spermatids became flattened and started to elongate along with condensation of chromatin in Sun3+/+ mice, whereas in Sun3−/− mice, spermatids still had a round nucleus although the chromatin had been condensed. At step 10, spermatid nuclei in Sun3+/+ mice became thinner and more elongated; however, the nuclei of spermatids were small and deformed and remained round in Sun3−/− mice (Fig. 4). We also noted that the number of spermatids was markedly reduced from step 10. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that abnormal morphology of Sun3−/− spermatids occurs when spermatids start to elongate. Because the microtubule manchette is essential for elongation of spermatids, and SUN3 localization is closely associated with the manchette (4Kierszenbaum A.L. Spermatid manchette: plugging proteins to zero into the sperm tail.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2001; 59 (11468770): 347-34910.1002/mrd.1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Göb E. Schmitt J. Benavente R. Alsheimer M.

Coimmunofluorescence staining of testis sections with antibodies against α-tubulin, a marker of manchette microtubules, and PNA was conducted. In Sun3+/+ mice, manchette microtubules were found to be tightly attached to the nuclear periphery at the caudal region opposite the acrosome of spermatids; however, these structures were not detected in Sun3−/− mice despite some weak and diffuse labeling that was ectopically positioned (Fig. 5A). To confirm loss of manchette microtubules in Sun3 knockout spermatids, immunofluorescence staining on testis cell smears was performed. In Sun3+/+ mice, spermatids from step 1 to step 16 could be distinguished based on the morphology of the acrosome, and the acrosome covering the anterior side of the nucleus as well as the microtubules of the manchette tightly surrounding the caudal region could be seen from step 7/8 to step 14/15 in Sun3+/+ spermatids. In Sun3−/− mice, we did not detect any morphological abnormalities in spermatids until step 7/8, and acrosomes covering the anterior side of the nucleus appeared to be normal in round spermatids. However, the typical microtubule arrays of the manchette were not observed in all spermatids from Sun3−/− mice. Aberrantly polymerized microtubule bundles that were dissociated from the nucleus were observed in about 5% of spermatids (Fig. 5B). Moreover, the perinuclear ring, a belt-like structure surrounding the nucleus where manchette microtubules insert, was also absent in spermatids from Sun3−/− mice (Fig. S4). Transmission EM (TEM) further revealed the presence of manchette microtubule bundles that were closely associated with the nuclear envelope in elongating spermatids from Sun3+/+ testes; however, these recognizable structures were not seen in elongating spermatids from Sun3−/− testes, although some disorganized microtubule bundles that had lost their interaction with the nucleus were observed (Fig. 5C). Thus, we conclude that SUN3 is not only indispensable for manchette formation but also likely required for the organization of manchette during sperm head shaping in mice. Deletion of SUN4, another SUN protein that associates with the manchette, also leads to defects in acrosome and manchette formation in mice (15Calvi A. Wong A.S. Wright G. Wong E.S. Loo T.H. Stewart C.L. Burke B. SUN4 is essential for nuclear remodeling during mammalian spermiogenesis.Dev. Biol. 2015; 407 (26417726): 321-33010.1016/j.ydbio.2015.09.010Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), similar to the findings in Sun3-null mice. To explore whether SUN3 interacts with SUN4 in testes, we performed immunoprecipitation using an anti-SUN3 antibody with testis lysates from Sun3+/+ mice. Western blotting detected SUN3 and SUN4 in lysates immunoprecipitated by the anti-SUN3 antibody but not in IgG-immunoprecipitated lysates (Fig. 6, A and B). Immunofluorescence staining in Sun3+/+ and Sun3−/− testicular sections revealed clear signals of SUN4 proteins surrounding the caudal region of the nucleus opposite the acrosome, where the manchette locates in step 7/8 spermatids, elongating spermatids, and elongated spermatids in Sun3+/+ mice, whereas only unspecific diffuse signals were observed in the cytoplasm of spermatids from Sun3−/− mice (Fig. 6C). Western blotting of testicular lysates revealed that the level of SUN4 proteins was drastically reduced in adult Sun3−/− mice compared with Sun3+/+ mice (Fig. 6D). These findings demonstrated that SUN3 and SUN4 interact and that SUN3 is required to maintain the level of SUN4 proteins in vivo. Sperm head shaping is a key event during spermiogenesis, and misshaping of sperm heads often leads to male infertility (24Yan W. Male infertility caused by spermiogenic defects: lessons from gene knockouts.Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2009; 306 (19481682): 24-3210.1016/j.mce.2009.03.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In this study, we generated mice lacking Sun3 through CRISPR/Cas9 technology and investigated the function of SUN3 during spermiogenesis. We found that loss of SUN3 leads to a drastic reduction in sperm numbers, a globozoospermia-like phenotype accompanied by multiple sperm tail defects resulting from failure of manchette formation during sperm head shaping, and, ultimately, male infertility. Additionally, we also demonstrated that SUN3 interacts with SUN4 in vivo and is required to maintain the level of SUN4 proteins in testes. We report, for the first time, that Sun3 is indispensable for sperm head shaping and particularly required for manchette formation. A typical manchette is characterized by highly organized microtubule bundles attached to the perinuclear ring, forming a sleeve-like structure surrounding the posterior part of the spermatid nucleus (5Courtens J.L. Loir M. The spermatid manchette of mammals: formation and relations with the nuclear envelope and the chromatin.Reprod. Nutr.

Eigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol in green tea, is known to exert a beneficial effect on PD patients. Although some mechanisms were suggested to underlie this intervention, it remains unknown if the EGCG-mediated protection was achieved by remodeling gut microbiota. In the present study, 0.1 mM or 0.5 mM EGCG was administered to the Drosophila melanogaster with PINK1 (PTEN induced putative kinase 1) mutations, a prototype PD model, and their behavioral performances, as well as neuronal/mitochondrial morphology (only for 0.5 mM EGCG treatment) were determined. According to the results, the mutant PINK1B9 flies exhibited dopaminergic, survival, and behavioral deficits, which were rescued by EGCG supplementation. Meanwhile, EGCG resulted in profound changes in gut microbial compositions in PINK1B9 flies, restoring the abundance of a set of bacteria. Notably, EGCG protection was blunted when gut microbiota was disrupted by antibiotics. We further isolated four bacterial strains from fly guts and the supplementation of individual Lactobacillus plantarum or Acetobacter pomorum strain exacerbated the neuronal and behavioral dysfunction of PD flies, which could not be rescued by EGCG. Transcriptomic analysis identified TotM as the central gene responding to EGCG or microbial manipulations. Genetic ablation of TotM blocked the recovery activity of EGCG, suggesting that EGCG-mediated protection warrants TotM. Apart from familial form, EGCG was also potent in improving sporadic PD symptoms induced by rotenone treatment, wherein gut microbiota shared regulatory roles. Together, our results suggest the relevance of the gut microbiota-TotM pathway in EGCG-mediated neuroprotection, providing insight into indirect mechanisms underlying nutritional intervention of Parkinson's disease."

The results show evidence of low prevalence and spatial clustering of modern contraception use across the country. There were also notable regional disparities in contraceptive use that favour mostly the southern regions. Modern contraceptive use is significantly associated with socioeconomic factors such as educational attainment, work status, and marital status, as well as age, religious affiliation, and parity. Contextual factors such as the convenient location of health facility and family planning messages exposure also have a considerable positive effect on modern contraceptive use. Uneducated, unemployed and never-married women are considerably disadvantaged in the utilisation of modern contraception in Ghana. Socioeconomic and contextual factors play a key role in modern contraceptive use in Ghana."

Here, we describe the use of interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) as an accurate low-cost strategy for flexible protein-ligand docking. We outline an experimental protocol which enables expert iMD-VR users to guide ligands into and out of the binding pockets of trypsin, neuraminidase, and HIV-1 protease, and recreate their respective crystallographic protein-ligand binding poses within 5-10 minutes. Following a brief training phase, our studies shown that iMD-VR novices were able to generate unbinding and rebinding pathways on similar timescales as iMD-VR experts, with the majority able to recover binding poses within 2.15 Å RMSD of the crystallographic binding pose. These results indicate that iMD-VR affords sufficient control for users to carry out the detailed atomic manipulations required to dock flexible ligands into dynamic enzyme active sites and recover crystallographic poses, offering an interesting new approach for simulating drug docking and generating binding hypotheses."

Respondents in the life and physical sciences were 1.7 times more likely to not report their experiences when compared to respondents in other disciplines.

Analysis of respondents' written accounts show variation of overall sentiment based on discipline, student type, and the type of institution attended, particularly with regard to mental health.

https://openalex.org/W3011684613,"Pleural empyema is an inflammatory condition characterized by accumulation of pus inside the pleural cavity, which is usually followed by bacterial pneumonia. During the disease process, the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines in the purulent pleural effusion cause proliferation of fibroblasts and deposition of extracellular matrix, which lead to fibrin deposition and fibrothorax. Urokinase instillation therapy through a chest drainage tube is frequently used for fibrinolysis in patients with empyema. However, urokinase treatment requires multiple instillation (2–3 times per day, for 4–8 days) and easily flows out from the chest drainage tube due to its high water solubility. In this in vitro study, we developed a thermo-responsive hydrogel based on poloxamer 407 (P407) combined with hyaluronic acid (HA) for optimal loading and release of urokinase. Our results show that the addition of HA to poloxamer gels provides a significantly more compact microstructure, with smaller pore sizes (**p < 0.001). The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) profile revealed no influence on the micellization intensity of poloxamer gel by HA. The 25% poloxamer-based gel was significantly superior to the 23% poloxamer-based gel, with slower gel erosion when comparing the 16th hour residual gel weight of both gels (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.001). The 25% poloxamer-HA gel also exhibited a superior urokinase release profile and longer release time. A Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) study of the P407/HA hydrogel showed no chemical interactions between P407 and HA in the hydrogel system. The thermoresponsive P407/HA hydrogel may have a promising potential in the loading and delivery of hydrophilic drugs. On top of that, in vitro toxicity test of this combination demonstrates a lower toxicity."

Plasma endothelial-derived exosomes (EDEs) were enriched by two-step immunoabsorption from four groups of participants with no clinical evidence of cerebrovascular disease: cognitively normal (CN) without WMH (CN without SCeVD, n = 20), CN with SCeVD (n = 22), preclinical AD (pAD) + mild cognitive impairment (MCI) without SCeVD (pAD/MCI without SCeVD, n = 22), and pAD/MCI with SCeVD (n = 16) for ELISA quantification of cargo proteins. Exosome marker CD81-normalized EDE levels of the cerebrovascular-selective biomarkers large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LAT-1), glucose transporter type 1 (Glut-1), and permeability-glycoprotein (p-GP, ABCB1) were similarly significantly higher in the CN with SCeVD and pAD/MCI with SCeVD groups than their corresponding control groups without SCeVD.

We carried out in vivo time-lapse imaging of Drosophila adult sensory neuron differentiation, integrating machine-learning-based quantification of arbor patterning with molecular-level tracking of cytoskeletal remodeling. This revealed that Myo6 and the transcription factor Knot regulate transient surges of microtubule polymerization at dendrite tips; they drive retrograde extension of an actin filament array that specifies anterograde microtubule polymerization and guides these microtubules to subdivide the tip into multiple branches. Primary branches delineate functional compartments; this tunable branching mechanism is key to define and diversify dendrite arbor compartmentalization."

We used a systematic camera trap survey to collect the data at 50 sites. The data were analyzed using overlap indices, and non-parametric test statistics to assess the spatiotemporal associations. Leopard and lion were crepuscular and nocturnal in their activity pattern. They did not segregate temporally and showed substantially high overlap and strong temporal association. Leopard segregates with lion spatially by overlapping less and showing no association in space use at specific camera trap sites. Leopards showed preference for dense habitats, while the lion preferred both dense and open habitats. Leopard showed moderate-overlap and positive association with key prey species, i.e., chital and sambar. Lion, however showed low site-specific overlap and negative association with its crucial prey species, i.e., sambar and wild pig. We conclude that site-specific spatial partitioning along with differential affinities for habitat is helping leopards to partition their spatio-temporal resources with lions and hence facilitate coexistence of leopards with lions in Gir forest."

Hypoxia facilitated HCC cells withstood oxidative stress and eventually promoted HCC cells metastasis, in which TXN and HIF-2α were mostly involved. Upregulation of TXN/HIF-2α correlated with poor HCC prognosis and promoted HCC metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process was involved in TXN/HIF-2α-enhanced invasiveness of HCC cells. Additionally, the stability and activity of HIF-2α were precisely regulated by TXN via SUMOylation and acetylation, which contributed to HCC metastasis. Our data revealed that the redox protein TXN and HIF-2α are both associated with HCC metastasis, and the fine regulation of TXN on HIF-2α contributes essentially during the process of metastasis. Our study provides new insight into the interaction mechanism between hypoxia and oxidative stress and implies potential therapeutic benefits by targeting both TXN and HIF-2α in the treatment of HCC metastasis."

Air, water, and soil samples associated with B. glabra sampled in industrial and residential areas were also analyzed for the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, metals, and particulate matter. There were significantly higher levels of flavonoids and phenolic compounds in the leaf extracts of plants growing in industrial areas compared to those growing in residential zones (P<0.05). Metal accumulation in leaves was also significantly higher in the industrial zone than the residential zone: iron, lead, zinc, nickel, and manganese were present at significantly higher levels in plants in the industrial zone compared to those growing in the residential zone (P<0.05); nevertheless, the concentrations of heavy metals in the air, water, and soil were under local legal environmental limits. This study demonstrates that pollution has significant effects on total phenolic, flavonoid and metal levels in B. glabra plants, not only demonstrating the effects of pollution on ecosystem health but also paving the way for using plants as bioindicators and for phytoremediation."

We here focused on chemokines as a candidate for the communication. Selected MG/MΦ-related chemokines were determined gene expression after SCI and further focused CCL2/CCR2 and CCL5/CCR5 to estimate role of the chemokines by hMSCs. Male C57/BL6 mice were subjected to spinal cord transection. Gene expression was assayed in the spinal cords following SCI for selected MG/MΦ-related chemokines and their receptors. hMSCs (5×105 cells) were then transplanted into parenchyma of the spinal cord, and the expressions of the Ccl2/Ccr2 and Ccl5/Ccr5 axes, inflammation, MG/MΦ-polarization, and axonal regeneration were evaluated to measure the influence of the hMSCs. Finally, mouse CCL5 was injected into the spinal cords. Acute increases in gene expression after SCI were observed for most chemokines, including Ccl2; chronic increases were observed for Ccl5. CCL2+-cells merged with NeuN+-neurons. CCR2+ immunoreactivity was principally observed in Ly-6G+/iNOS+-granulocytes on postoperative day (pod) 1, and CCL5+ and CCR5+ immunoreactivity overlapped with NeuN+-neurons and F4/80+-MG/MΦ on pod 14. The hMSC transplantation enhanced Ccl2 and Ccl5 and improved locomotor activity. The hMSC implantation did not alter the number of Ly-6G+/CCR2+ but decreased Il1, Elane, and Mpo on pod 3. Conversely, hMSC transplantation increased expression of Zc3h12a (encodes MCP-1-induced protein) on pod 14. Moreover, hMSC increased the Aif1, and two alternatively activated macrophage (AAM)-related genes, Arg1 and Chil3 (Ym1), as well as axonal regenerative markers, Dpysl2 and Gap43. Gene expression indicative of AAM polarization and axonal regeneration were partially recovered by CCL5 injection. These results suggest that hMSC implantation increases Ccl2 and Ccl5, improves locomotor activity, enhances MG/MΦ polarization to AAM, and increases the gene expression of axonal regenerative markers. These functions of hMSCs might be partially mediated by the CCL2/CCR2 and CCL5/CCR5 axes."

The 14 remote sensing variables were normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), nitrogen reflectance index (NRI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), structure intensive pigment index (SIPI), plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), difference vegetation index (DVI), ratio vegetation index (RVI), Rblue (reflectance at blue band), Rgreen (reflectance at green band), Rred (reflectance at red band) and Rnir (reflectance at near infrared band). The partial least square (PLS) algorithm was used to construct and validate the multivariate remote sensing model of predicting wheat GPC. The research showed a close relationship between wheat GPC and 12 remote sensing variables other than Rblue and Rgreen of the spectral reflectance bands. Among them, except PSRI and Rblue, Rgreen and Rred, other remote sensing vegetation indexes had significant multiple correlations. The optimal principal components of PLS model used to predict wheat GPC were: NDVI, SIPI, PSRI and EVI. All these were sensitive variables to predict wheat GPC. Through modeling set and verification set evaluation, GPC prediction models' coefficients of determination (R2) were 0.84 and 0.8, respectively. The root mean square errors (RMSE) were 0.43% and 0.54%, respectively. It indicated that the PLS algorithm model predicted wheat GPC better than models for linear regression (LR) and principal components analysis (PCA) algorithms. The PLS algorithm model’s prediction accuracies were above 90%. The improvement was by more than 20% than the model for LR algorithm and more than 15% higher than the model for PCA algorithm. The results could provide an effective way to improve the accuracy of remotely predicting winter wheat GPC through satellite images, and was conducive to large-area application and promotion."

Pannexin-1 inhibition and knockout decreased FSS-modulated ATP release. In iKsp-Pkd1-/- mice, elevated renal pannexin-1 mRNA expression and urinary ATP were observed. In Pkd1-/- mDCT15 cells, elevated ATP release was observed upon the FSS mechanosensation. In these cells, increased pannexin-1 mRNA expression was observed. Importantly, pannexin-1 inhibition in pkd2-MO decreased the renal cyst growth. Our results demonstrate that pannexin-1 channels mediate ATP release into the tubular lumen due to pro-urinary flow. We present pannexin-1 as novel therapeutic target to prevent the renal cyst growth in PKD."

Here, design of experiments (DOE) is used to investigate the cardiac differentiation space of three hiPSC lines when varying CHIR99027 concentration and cell seeding density, and a novel image analysis is developed to evaluate plate coverage when initiating differentiation. Metabolic selection via lactate purifies hiPSC-cardiomyocyte populations, and the bioenergetic phenotype and engineered tissue mechanics of purified and unpurified hiPSC-cardiomyocytes are compared. Findings demonstrate that when initiating differentiation one day after hiPSC plating, low (3 μM) Chiron and 72 x 103 cells/cm2 seeding density result in peak cardiac purity (50–90%) for all three hiPSC lines. Our results confirm that metabolic selection with lactate shifts hiPSC-cardiomyocyte metabolism towards oxidative phosphorylation, but this more “mature” metabolic phenotype does not by itself result in a more mature contractile phenotype in engineered cardiac tissues at one week of culture in 3D tissues. This study provides widely adaptable methods including novel image analysis code and parameters for refining hiPSC-cardiomyocyte differentiation and describes the practical implications of metabolic selection of cardiomyocytes for downstream tissue engineering applications."

https://openalex.org/W3010979342,"Spatiotemporal patterns of global forest net primary productivity (NPP) are pivotal for us to understand the interaction between the climate and the terrestrial carbon cycle. In this study, we use Google Earth Engine (GEE), which is a powerful cloud platform, to study the dynamics of the global forest NPP with remote sensing and climate datasets. In contrast with traditional analyses that divide forest areas according to geographical location or climate types to retrieve general conclusions, we categorize forest regions based on their NPP levels. Nine categories of forests are obtained with the self-organizing map (SOM) method, and eight relative factors are considered in the analysis. We found that although forests can achieve higher NPP with taller, denser and more broad-leaved trees, the influence of the climate is stronger on the NPP; for the high-NPP categories, precipitation shows a weak or negative correlation with vegetation greenness, while lacking water may correspond to decrease in productivity for low-NPP categories. The low-NPP categories responded mainly to the La Niña event with an increase in the NPP, while the NPP of the high-NPP categories increased at the onset of the El Niño event and decreased soon afterwards when the warm phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) wore off. The influence of the ENSO changes correspondingly with different NPP levels, which infers that the pattern of climate oscillation and forest growth conditions have some degree of synchronization. These findings may facilitate the understanding of global forest NPP variation from a different perspective."

Owing to its properties, the use of colostrum in the treatment of human diseases is under investigation. We evaluated the biological activity of colostrum on human primary keratinocytes, focusing on its effects with regard to a proliferation/differentiation balance. Using cellular and molecular approaches, we showed that colostrum favors a cell cycle withdrawal by increasing the expression of p21/WAF1 and p27/KIP1. It also promotes the transition of keratinocytes from a proliferating to a differentiating state, as assessed by a decrease in keratin 5 and an increase in keratin 16. We demonstrated the ability of colostrum to induce the expression of early and late differentiation markers (keratin 1, involucrin, and filaggrin) and the synthesis of caspase 14 and bleomycin hydrolase, the two main enzymes involved in filaggrin maturation. Moreover, we showed that bovine colostrum is able to promote keratinocyte stratification and terminal differentiation not only in two-dimensional (2D), but also in a more physiological system of three-dimensional (3D) skin equivalents. Finally, we demonstrated that colostrum stimulates cell differentiation through the PI3K/PLC-γ1/PKCα pathways mainly associated to tyrosine kinase receptors. These results suggest the possibility to benefit from colostrum properties for the treatment of skin diseases characterized by altered differentiation and perturbed barrier function."

The oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (Olig2) was identified as a marker for glioma stem cells, which are believed to be responsible for glioma recurrence and therapy resistance. In this retrospective analysis we assessed the prognostic value of oligodendroglial and glioma stem cell markers in 113 IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. Immunohistochemical staining for Olig2, NogoA, AQP4 and Nestin was performed in combination with sequencing of IDH1 and IDH2 as well as promotor methylation analysis of the MGMT gene. Even though differences in overall survival according to Olig2 expression were observed, univariate and multivariate survival analysis did not reveal a firm significant prognostic impact of Olig2, NogoA, AQP4 or Nestin expression. Additionally, no differences in the expression of these markers depending on clinical status, age or gender were found. The established independent prognostic factors age<65, Karnofsky Performance Status> = 70 and methylated MGMT gene promoter were significant in the multivariate analysis. In conclusion expression of oligodendroglial and glioma stem cell markers do not have an independent prognostic effect in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W3010671858,"Intestinal cells control delivery of lipids to the body by adsorption, storage and secretion. Copper (Cu) is an important trace element and has been shown to modulate lipid metabolism. Mutation of the liver Cu exporter ATP7B is the cause of Wilson disease and is associated with Cu accumulation in different tissues. To determine the relationship of Cu and lipid homeostasis in intestinal cells, a CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of ATP7B (KO) was introduced in Caco-2 cells. KO cells showed increased sensitivity to Cu, elevated intracellular Cu storage, and induction of genes regulating oxidative stress. Chylomicron structural protein ApoB48 was significantly downregulated in KO cells by Cu. Apolipoproteins ApoA1, ApoC3 and ApoE were constitutively induced by loss of ATP7B. Formation of small sized lipid droplets (LDs) was enhanced by Cu, whereas large sized LDs were reduced. Cu reduced triglyceride (TG) storage and secretion. Exposure of KO cells to oleic acid (OA) resulted in enhanced TG storage. The findings suggest that Cu represses intestinal TG lipogenesis, while loss of ATP7B results in OA-induced TG storage."
https://openalex.org/W3012510736,"This study examined the socio-demographic factors associated with normal linear growth among pre-school children living in better-off households, using survey data from Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Mozambique and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The primary outcome variable was child height-for-age z-scores (HAZ), categorised into HAZ≥-2SD (normal growth/not stunted) and HAZ<-2 (stunted). Using logistic regression, we estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of the factors associated with normal growth. Higher maternal weight (measured by body mass index) was associated with increased odds of normal growth in Mozambique, DRC, Kenya and Nigeria. A unit increase in maternal years of education was associated with increased odds in normal growth in DRC (aOR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.09), Ghana (aOR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.04, 1.12), Mozambique (aOR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.11) and Nigeria (aOR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.06, 1.08). A year increase in maternal age was positively associated with normal growth in all the five countries. Breastfeeding was associated with increased odds of normal growth in Nigeria (aOR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.16, 1.46) and Kenya (aOR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.79). Children of working mothers had 25% (aOR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.60, 0.93) reduced odds of normal growth in DRC. A unit change in maternal parity was associated with 10% (aOR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.84, 0.97), 23% (aOR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.63, 0.93), 25% (aOR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.69, 0.82), 6% (aOR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.89, 0.99) and 5% (aOR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.92, 0.99) reduced odds of normal growth in DRC, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique and Nigeria, respectively. A child being a male was associated with 18% (aOR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.68, 0.98), 40% (aOR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.40, 0.89), 37% (aOR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.51, 0.77) and 21% (aOR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.71, 0.87) reduced odds of normal child growth in DRC, Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria, respectively. In conclusion, maternal education, weight, age, breastfeeding and antenatal care are positively associated with normal child growth. In contrast, maternal parity, employment, and child sex and age are associated negatively with normal growth. Interventions to improve child growth should take into account these differential effects."
https://openalex.org/W3009242880,"People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) who exhibit minimal to no disability are still over twice as likely to fall as the general population and many of these falls occur during walking. There is a need for more effective ways to detect preclinical walking balance deficits in PwMS. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of optical flow perturbations applied using virtual reality on walking balance in PwMS compared to age-matched controls. We hypothesized that susceptibility to perturbations–especially those in the mediolateral direction–would be larger in PwMS compared to controls. Fourteen PwMS and fourteen age-matched controls walked on a treadmill while viewing a virtual hallway with and without optical flow perturbations in the mediolateral or anterior-posterior directions. We quantified foot placement kinematics, gait variability, lateral margin of stability and, in a separate session, performance on the standing sensory organization test (SOT). We found only modest differences between groups during normal, unperturbed walking. These differences were larger and more pervasive in the presence of mediolateral perturbations, evidenced by higher variability in step width, sacrum position, and margin of stability at heel-strike in PwMS than controls. PwMS also performed worse than controls on the SOT, and there was a modest correlation between step width variability during perturbed gait and SOT visual score. In conclusion, mediolateral optical flow perturbations revealed differences in walking balance in PwMS that went undetected during normal, unperturbed walking. Targeting this difference may be a promising approach to more effectively detect preclinical walking balance deficits in PwMS."

We examined the flexibility for making the most profitable decisions in a multi-dimensional tool-use task, involving different apparatuses, tools and rewards of varying quality, in 3-5-year-old children, adult humans and tool-making New Caledonian crows (Corvus moneduloides). We also compared our results to previous studies on habitually tool-making orangutans (Pongo abelii) and non-tool-making Goffin’s cockatoos (Cacatua goffiniana). Adult humans, cockatoos and crows, but not children and orangutans, did not select a tool when it was not necessary, which was the more profitable choice in this situation. Adult humans, orangutans and cockatoos, but not crows and children, were able to refrain from selecting non-functional tools. By contrast, the birds, but not the primates tested, struggled to attend to multiple variables—where two apparatuses, two tools and two reward qualities were presented simultaneously—without extended experience. These findings indicate: (1) in a similar manner to humans and orangutans, New Caledonian crows and Goffin’s cockatoos can flexibly make profitable decisions in some decision-making tool-use tasks, though the birds may struggle when tasks become more complex; (2) children and orangutans may have a bias to use tools in situations where adults and other tool-making species do not."
https://openalex.org/W3011780377,"Abstract Lineage selective transcription factors (TFs) are important regulators of tumorigenesis, but their biological functions are often context dependent with undefined epigenetic mechanisms of action. In this study, we uncover a conditional role for the endodermal and pulmonary specifying TF GATA6 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) progression. Impairing Gata6 in genetically engineered mouse models reduces the proliferation and increases the differentiation of Kras mutant LUAD tumors. These effects are influenced by the epithelial cell type that is targeted for transformation and genetic context of Kras-mediated tumor initiation. In LUAD cells derived from surfactant protein C expressing progenitors, we identify multiple genomic loci that are bound by GATA6. Moreover, suppression of Gata6 in these cells significantly alters chromatin accessibility, particularly at distal enhancer elements. Analogous to its paradoxical activity in lung development, GATA6 expression fluctuates during different stages of LUAD progression and can epigenetically control diverse transcriptional programs associated with bone morphogenetic protein signaling, alveolar specification, and tumor suppression. These findings reveal how GATA6 can modulate the chromatin landscape of lung cancer cells to control their proliferation and divergent lineage dependencies during tumor progression."

There were few documented cases before the epidemic in the United States in 2014. The Taiwan Centers for Diseases Control also confirmed that EV-D68 has been endemic, and some cases of acute flaccid myelitis were reported in Taiwan. To understand the current EV-D68 serostatus, we performed an EV-D68 seroepidemiology study in Taiwan in 2017.After informed consent was obtained, we enrolled preschool children, 6- to 15-year-old students and 16- to 49-year-old people. The participants underwent a questionnaire investigation and blood sampling to measure the EV-D68 neutralization antibody.In total, 920 subjects were enrolled from the northern, central, southern and eastern parts of Taiwan with a male-to-female ratio of 1.03. The EV-D68 seropositive rate was 32% (26/82) in infants, 18% (27/153) in 1-year-old children, 43% (36/83) in 2-year-old children, 60% (94/156) in 3- to 5-year-old children, 89% (108/122) in 6- to 11-year-old primary school students, 98% (118/121) in 12- to 15-year-old high school students, 100% (122/122) in 16- to 49-year-old women and 100% (81/81) in 16- to 49-year-old males in 2017. Among preschool children, EV-D68 seropositivity was related to age (p for trend <0.0001), size of household ≧4 members (p = 0.037) and kindergarten attendance (p = 0.027). The seropositive rate varied among different geographic regions.EV-D68 infection was prevalent, and its seropositive rates increased with age, larger household size and kindergarten attendance among preschool children."
https://openalex.org/W3011489642,"Annual trunk increments are essential for short-term analyses of the response of trees to various factors. For instance, based on annual trunk increments, it is possible to develop and calibrate forest growth models. We investigated the possibility of estimating annual trunk increments from the terrestrial structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry. Obtaining the annual trunk increments of mature trees is challenging due to the relatively small growth of trunks within one year. In our experiment, annual trunk increments were obtained by two conventional methods: measuring tape (perimeter increment) at heights of 0.8, 1.3, and 1.8 m on the trunk and increment borer (diameter increment) at a height of 1.3 m on the trunk. The following tree species were investigated: Fagus sylvatica L. (beech), Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. (oak), Picea abies (L.) H. Karst (spruce), and Abies alba Mill (fir). The annual trunk increments ranged from 0.9 cm to 2.4 cm (tape/perimeter) and from 0.7 mm to 3.1 mm (borer/diameter). The data were collected before- and after-vegetation season, besides the data collection increment borer. When the estimated perimeters from the terrestrial SfM photogrammetry were compared to those obtained using the measuring tape, the root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.25–1.33 cm. The relative RMSE did not exceed 1% for all tree species. No statistically significant differences were found between the annual trunk increments obtained using the measuring tape and terrestrial SfM photogrammetry for beech, spruce, and fir. Only in the case of oak, the difference was statistically significant. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient between the annual trunk increments collected using the increment borer and those derived from terrestrial SfM photogrammetry was positive and equal to 0.6501. Terrestrial SfM photogrammetry is a hardware low-demanding technique that provides accurate three-dimensional data that can, based on our results, even detect small temporal tree trunk changes."
https://openalex.org/W3011059871,"Hsp104 is a hexameric AAA+ yeast disaggregase capable of solubilizing disordered aggregates and amyloid. Hsp104 couples ATP hydrolysis to polypeptide translocation through its central channel. Substrate binding by Hsp104 is mediated primarily by two conserved tyrosine residues in nucleotide binding domain (NBD) 1 and NBD2. Recent structural studies have revealed that an additional tyrosine residue (Y650) located in NBD2 appears to contact substrate and may play an important role in Hsp104 function. Here, we functionally analyze the properties of this proposed Hsp104 –substrate interaction. We find that Y650 is not essential for Hsp104 to confer thermotolerance. Supporting these findings, in a potentiated Hsp104 variant background, the Y650A mutation does not abolish potentiation. However, modulation of this site does have subtle effects on the activity of this potentiated Hsp104 variant. We therefore suggest that while Y650 is not essential for Hsp104 function, its modulation may be useful for fine-tuning Hsp104 properties."
https://openalex.org/W3011197006,"Abstract The reason for the reduced efficacy of lung cancer therapy is the existence of lung cancer stem cells (CSCs). Targeting CSCs results in evolved phenotypes with increased malignancy, leading to therapy failure. Here, we propose a new therapeutic strategy: investigating the “transitional” cells that represent the stage between normal lung stem cells and lung CSCs. Identifying and targeting the key molecule that drives carcinogenesis to inhibit or reverse this process would thus provide new perspectives for early diagnosis and intervention in lung cancer. We used Gprc5a-knockout (KO) mice, the first animal model of spontaneous lung adenocarcinoma established by the deletion of a single lung tumor suppressor gene. We investigated the interaction of lung progenitor cells AT2 with Lgr5 cells in the generation of CSCs and related signaling mechanism. In the present study, using Gprc5a-KO mice, we found the initiator Sca-1 + Abcg1 + subset with a CSC-like phenotype within the lung progenitor AT2 cell population in mice that had not yet developed tumors. We confirmed the self-renewal and tumor initiation capacities of this subset in vitro, in vivo, and clinical samples. Mechanistically, we found that the generation of Sca-1 + Abcg1 + cells was associated with an interaction between AT2 and Lgr5 cells and the subsequent activation of the ECM1-α6β4-ABCG1 axis. Importantly, Sca-1 + Abcg1 + and SPA + ABCG1 + cells specifically existed in the small bronchioles of Gprc5a-KO mice and patients with pneumonia, respectively. Thus, the present study unveiled a new kind of lung cancer-initiating cells (LCICs) and provided potential markers for the early diagnosis of lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3010690841,"Current efforts to improve muscle performance are focused on muscle trophism via inhibition of the myostatin pathway: however they have been unsuccessful in the clinic to date. In this study, a novel protein has been created by combining the soluble activin receptor, a strong myostatin inhibitor, to the C-terminal agrin nLG3 domain (ActR-Fc-nLG3) involved in the development and maintenance of neuromuscular junctions. Both domains are connected via the constant region of an Igg1 monoclonal antibody. Surprisingly, young male mice treated with ActR-Fc-nLG3 showed a remarkably increased endurance in the rotarod test, significantly longer than the single domain compounds ActR-Fc and Fc-nLG3 treated animals. This increase in endurance was accompanied by only a moderate increase in body weights and wet muscle weights of ActR-Fc-nLG3 treated animals and were lower than expected. The myostatin inhibitor ActR-Fc induced, as expected, a highly significant increase in body and muscle weights compared to control animals and ActR-Fc-nLG3 treated animals. Moreover, the prolonged endurance effect was not observed when ActR-Fc and Fc-nLG3 were dosed simultaneously as a mixture and the body and muscle weights of these animals were very similar to ActR-Fc treated animals, indicating that both domains need to be on one molecule. Muscle morphology induced by ActR-Fc-nLG3 did not appear to be changed however, close examination of the neuromuscular junction showed significantly increased acetylcholine receptor surface area for ActR-Fc-nLG3 treated animals compared to controls. This result is consistent with published observations that endurance training in rats increased acetylcholine receptor quantity at neuromuscular junctions and provide evidence that improving nerve-muscle interaction could be an important factor for sustaining long term muscle activity."

Aortal wall histology and infiltration by recipient immune cells, as well as donor specific anti MHC class I and II antibodies in recipient serum were studied in both isografts and allografts on day 30 postransplant. Core data of cryopreserved allografts were compared to our previous data of cold-stored aortal allografts treated in accordance with our clinical cold-storage protocol.Cryopreserved allografts showed regular morphology of aortal wall with clear differentiation of all three basic anatomical layers on day 30 postransplant. Intimal layer showed no hyperplasia, luminal surface was covered by endothelial cells. No statistical difference was observed in tunica media thickness between isografts and allografts. The medial layer showed no necrosis, shrinkage or immunoglobuline G deposition in any experimental group. The adventitial infiltration by immune cells was significantly higher (P<0.05) in allografts. Cryopreserved allografts showed significant lower activation of both cell- and antibody mediated immunity compared to historical data of cold-stored allografts.Aortal wall histology of rat allografts treated by our new standardized clinical cryopreservation/slow thawing protocol was comparable to that of the cryopreserved isografts on day 30 posttranspant.

https://openalex.org/W3011512501,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a member of the endothelin family of peptide hormones first discovered as endothelium-derived mediators regulating vascular tone. ET-1 also regulates the proliferation and differentiation of bone cells that synthesize fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). FGF23 is a hormone controlling renal phosphate and vitamin D metabolism. Here, we studied the role of ET-1 and endothelin receptor B (ETB) for FGF23 production. Fgf23 gene expression was studied in IDG-SW3 bone cells by quantitative RT-PCR. ETB-expressing (etb+/+) and rescued ETB-deficient mice (etb−/−) were studied in metabolic cages. Their serum FGF23, PTH, and 1,25(OH)2D3 concentrations were determined by ELISA, serum and urinary phosphate and Ca2+ by photometric methods. ET-1 and ETB agonist sarafotoxin 6c suppressed Fgf23 mRNA in IDG-SW3 cells. Serum C-terminal and intact FGF23 as well as bone Fgf23 mRNA levels were significantly higher in etb−/− mice than in etb+/+ mice. Renal phosphate excretion was significantly higher in etb−/− mice despite lower phosphate levels. In addition, etb−/− animals exhibited calciuria and a significantly higher serum 1,25(OH)2D3 concentration compared to etb+/+ mice. In conclusion, ETB-dependent ET-1 signaling is a potent suppressor of FGF23 formation. This effect is likely to be of clinical relevance given the use of endothelin receptor antagonists in various diseases."

Proper understanding of the local situation is essential to formulate appropriate, locally driven, livestock keeper education to sustainably improve animal health, welfare and productivity. In-depth interviewing and direct observation were used to understand the farming strategies, husbandry practices and challenges to health and productivity in a cluster of typical villages in the Kaziranga region of Assam, India, where resource use is balanced between the needs of humans and livestock, with competition from wild species. Knowledge of the importance of colostrum consumption by calves is poor. Timely consumption of sufficient colostrum (locally called “phehu”) by calves was clearly sub-optimal in the majority of households. The reasons behind this are nuanced, but the practice of collecting colostrum from newly calved cows to make confectionery for human consumption is an important contributory factor. Care of the umbilicus of the newborn is not routine practice in the locality. Local women are the key group assisting with young and sick animals, including cases of simple dystocia and retained foetal membranes. Cows are usually milked once daily, to attempt to balance the needs for milk of household with those of the calf, which can result in suboptimal nutrition for calves. There are clear opportunities to improve animal health and productivity through locally provided farmer education, particularly with reference to colostrum provision, and the engagement of women farmers in any such programme is key to success."
https://openalex.org/W3011693141,"Agriculture is the dominating land-use in the EU member states covering nearly half of the surface area. Using herbicides to reduce weed competition in agricultural areas can adversely affect Non-Target Terrestrial Plants (NTTP) growing in field margins. According to the EFSA Scientific Opinion on NTTPs an important protection goal is to maintain the biodiversity of plant species in agricultural areas. EFSA recommends to include also non-crop species mentioned in OECD guidelines (OECD 208 and 227) in the testing and to assess not only vegetative but also generative endpoints during the plant life-cycle such as flowering and seed production. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of assessing generative endpoints of crop and non-crop species for NTTP regulatory testing under greenhouse conditions and to assess if generative endpoints are more sensitive than vegetative endpoints. The experimental design consisted of one control and four herbicide (Atlantis® WG) application rates, with 6 replicates each. The application rates of the test substance were the maximum field rate and 30%, 10% and 3% of the field rate. Biomass, plant height, flowering, seed production as well as seedling emergence of the F1 generation were assessed. The study shows a feasible approach to assess vegetative and generative endpoints of (non-) crops species under greenhouse conditions on the basis of the OECD guideline 227. The vegetative endpoints plant height and biomass were not more sensitive if assessed during the generative growth stage when compared to the vegetative growth stage of the plants. In contrast to that, the generative endpoint seed production was partly more sensitive in comparison to the vegetative endpoints biomass and plant height. For regulatory NTTP studies, 5 or more test substance rates at non-lethal levels should be tested so to allow the determination of ER10/50 values for vegetative and generative endpoints."

The ontogeny of these behaviors in rural, non-Western populations remains understudied. This study assessed deception and mistrust within peer interactions among 4- to 8-year-old Hai||om children from rural Namibia (N = 64). Participants engaged in a dyadic game in which their self-interests were either aligned (cooperation condition) or opposed (competition condition) to those of their coplayers. Similar to previous evidence taken from Western participants, children mistrusted their coplayers during competition, but not during cooperation. Rates of actual deception were low in both conditions, which contrasts previous findings among Western populations. On an individual level, those children who deceived were also more likely to mistrust their peers. These results reveal novel insights on the ontogenetic primacy of mistrust over deception in young children's peer interactions in a rural, non-Western community."
