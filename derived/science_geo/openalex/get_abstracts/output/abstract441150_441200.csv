https://openalex.org/W2112612051,"Neuroblastomas are tumors of peripheral sympathetic neurons and are the most common solid tumor in children. To determine the genetic basis for neuroblastoma, we performed whole-genome sequencing (6 cases), exome sequencing (16 cases), genome-wide rearrangement analyses (32 cases) and targeted analyses of specific genomic loci (40 cases) using massively parallel sequencing. On average, each tumor had 19 somatic alterations in coding genes (range of 3-70). Among genes not previously known to be involved in neuroblastoma, chromosomal deletions and sequence alterations of the chromatin-remodeling genes ARID1A and ARID1B were identified in 8 of 71 tumors (11%) and were associated with early treatment failure and decreased survival. Using tumor-specific structural alterations, we developed an approach to identify rearranged DNA fragments in sera, providing personalized biomarkers for minimal residual disease detection and monitoring. These results highlight the dysregulation of chromatin remodeling in pediatric tumorigenesis and provide new approaches for the management of patients with neuroblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2102032782,"There is great interest in tumor stem cells (TSCs) as potential therapeutic targets; however, cancer therapies targeting TSCs are limited. A drawback is that TSC markers are often shared by normal stem cells (NSCs); thus, therapies that target these markers may cause severe injury to normal tissues. To identify a potential TSC-specific marker, we focused on doublecortin-like kinase 1 (Dclk1). Dclk1 was reported as a candidate NSC marker in the gut, but recent reports have implicated it as a marker of differentiated cells (for example, Tuft cells). Using lineage-tracing experiments, we show here that Dclk1 does not mark NSCs in the intestine but instead marks TSCs that continuously produce tumor progeny in the polyps of Apc(Min/+) mice. Specific ablation of Dclk1-positive TSCs resulted in a marked regression of polyps without apparent damage to the normal intestine. Our data suggest the potential for developing a therapy for colorectal cancer based on targeting Dclk1-positive TSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2046751492,"TGF-β signaling is required for normal tissue repair; however, excessive TGF-β signaling can lead to robust profibrotic gene expression in fibroblasts, resulting in tissue fibrosis. TGF-β binds to cell-surface receptors, resulting in the phosphorylation of the Smad family of transcription factors to initiate gene expression. TGF-β also initiates Smad-independent pathways, which augment gene expression. Here, we report that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated at complex III are required for TGF-β-induced gene expression in primary normal human lung fibroblasts. TGF-β-induced ROS could be detected in both the mitochondrial matrix and cytosol. Mitochondrially targeted antioxidants markedly attenuated TGF-β-induced gene expression without affecting Smad phosphorylation or nuclear translocation. Genetically disrupting mitochondrial complex III-generated ROS production attenuated TGF-β-induced profibrotic gene expression. Furthermore, inhibiting mitochondrial ROS generation attenuated NOX4 (NADPH oxidase 4) expression, which is required for TGF-β induced myofibroblast differentiation. Lung fibroblasts from patients with pulmonary fibrosis generated more mitochondrial ROS than normal human lung fibroblasts, and mitochondrially targeted antioxidants attenuated profibrotic gene expression in both normal and fibrotic lung fibroblasts. Collectively, our results indicate that mitochondrial ROS are essential for normal TGF-β-mediated gene expression and that targeting mitochondrial ROS might be beneficial in diseases associated with excessive fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2077687384,"The sub-population of tumor cells termed ‘cancer stem cells’ (CSCs) possess the capability to generate tumors, undergo epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and are implicated in metastasis, making treatments to specifically target CSCs an attractive therapeutic strategy. Tumor hypoxia plays a key role in regulating EMT and cancer stem cell function. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is a hypoxia-inducible protein that regulates cellular pH to promote cancer cell survival and invasion in hypoxic microenvironments and is a biomarker of poor prognosis for breast cancer metastasis and survival. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of CAIX expression or activity with novel small-molecule inhibitors in breast cancer cell lines, or in primary metastatic breast cancer cells, results in the inhibition of breast CSC expansion in hypoxia. We identify the mTORC1 axis as a critical pathway downstream of CAIX in the regulation of cancer stem cell function. CAIX is also required for expression of EMT markers and regulators, as well as drivers of ‘stemness’, such as Notch1 and Jagged1 in isolated CSCs. In addition, treatment of mice bearing orthotopic breast tumors with CAIX-specific small-molecule inhibitors results in significant depletion of CSCs within these tumors. Furthermore, combination treatment with paclitaxel results in enhanced tumor growth delay and eradication of lung metastases. These data demonstrate that CAIX is a critical mediator of the expansion of breast CSCs in hypoxic niches by sustaining the mesenchymal and ‘stemness’ phenotypes of these cells, making CAIX an important therapeutic target for selectively depleting breast CSCs."

https://openalex.org/W2072703892,"The interaction between epithelial cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) has a major role in cancer progression and eventually in metastasis. In colorectal cancer (CRC), CAFs are present in high abundance, but their origin and functional interaction with epithelial tumor cells has not been elucidated. In this study we observed strong activation of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/Smad signaling pathway in CRC CAFs, accompanied by decreased signaling in epithelial tumor cells. We evaluated the TGF-β1 response and the expression of target genes including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 of various epithelial CRC cell lines and primary CAFs in vitro. TGF-β1 stimulation caused high upregulation of MMPs, PAI-1 and TGF-β1 itself. Next we showed that incubation of CAFs with conditioned medium (CM) from epithelial cancer cells led to hyperactivation of the TGF-β signaling pathway, enhanced expression of target genes like PAI-1, and the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). We propose that the interaction of tumor cells with resident fibroblasts results in hyperactivated TGF-β1 signaling and subsequent transdifferentiation of the fibroblasts into α-SMA-positive CAFs. In turn this leads to cumulative production of TGF-β and proteinases within the tumor microenvironment, creating a cancer-promoting feedback loop."
https://openalex.org/W2081651784,"There is increasing evidence that oncogenic transformation modifies the metabolic program of cells. A common alteration is the upregulation of glycolysis, and efforts to target glycolytic enzymes for anticancer therapy are under way. Here, we performed a genome-wide haploid genetic screen to identify resistance mechanisms to 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA), a drug candidate that inhibits glycolysis in a poorly understood fashion. We identified the SLC16A1 gene product, MCT1, as the main determinant of 3-BrPA sensitivity. MCT1 is necessary and sufficient for 3-BrPA uptake by cancer cells. Additionally, SLC16A1 mRNA levels are the best predictor of 3-BrPA sensitivity and are most elevated in glycolytic cancer cells. Furthermore, forced MCT1 expression in 3-BrPA-resistant cancer cells sensitizes tumor xenografts to 3-BrPA treatment in vivo. Our results identify a potential biomarker for 3-BrPA sensitivity and provide proof of concept that the selectivity of cancer-expressed transporters can be exploited for delivering toxic molecules to tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2048346637,"Using microRNA (miRNA) expression array, we identified that miR-7 was deregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC). We studied the biological role and molecular target of miR-7 in CRC. miR-7 was downregulated in six out of seven colon cancer cell lines. Ectopic expression of miR-7 suppressed colon cancer cell proliferation (P<0.05), induced apoptosis (P<0.05) and caused cell-cycle arrest in G1 phase (P<0.05). The tumor suppressive function of miR-7 was further confirmed in nude mice (P<0.05). The 3′-untranslated region (3′UTR) of Yin Yang 1 (YY1) mRNA contains an evolutionarily conserved miR-7 binding site using in silico searches, luciferase reporter assay and western blot analysis confirmed that miR-7 directly bound to YY1 3′UTR to negatively regulate the protein expression of YY1 in colon cancer cell lines HCT116 and LOVO. Intriguingly, knock-down of YY1 in three colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, LOVO and DLD1) consistently suppressed cell proliferation (P<0.01) and induced apoptosis (P<0.01), indicating the opposite functions of miR-7 and YY1 in CRC. Consistent with these data, ectopic expression of YY1 promoted cell growth by increasing proliferation (P<0.01) and suppressing apoptosis (P<0.001). The tumorigenic ability of YY1 was further confirmed in vivo in xenograft-nude mouse model (P<0.01). In addition, pathway analyses revealed that the oncogenic effect by YY1 was associated with inhibiting p53 and modulating its downstream effectors p15, caspase cascades and C-Jun, and activating Wnt signaling pathway through activating β-catenin, anti-apoptotic survivin and fibroblast growth factor 4. Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that patients with YY1 protein high expression had a significant decrease in overall survival, and Kaplan–Meier survival curves showed that these patients had significantly shorter survival than others (P<0.0001). In conclusion, MiR-7 is a novel miRNA with tumor suppressive function in colon cancer by targeting oncogenic YY1. YY1 promotes colon cancer growth through inhibiting p53 and promoting Wnt signaling pathways and serves as an independent prognostic biomarker for CRC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2168114040,"Activated macrophages are classified into two different forms: classically activated (M1) or alternatively activated (M2) macrophages. The presence of M1/M2 phenotypic polarization has also been suggested for microglia. Here, we report that the secreted protein lipocalin 2 (LCN2) amplifies M1 polarization of activated microglia. LCN2 protein (EC 1 μg/ml), but not glutathione S-transferase used as a control, increased the M1-related gene expression in cultured mouse microglial cells after 8-24 h. LCN2 was secreted from M1-polarized, but not M2-polarized, microglia. LCN2 inhibited phosphorylation of STAT6 in IL-4-stimulated microglia, suggesting LCN2 suppression of the canonical M2 signaling. In the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse neuroinflammation model, the expression of LCN2 was notably increased in microglia. Primary microglial cultures derived from LCN2-deficient mice showed a suppressed M1 response and enhanced M2 response. Mice lacking LCN2 showed a markedly reduced M1-related gene expression in microglia after LPS injection, which was consistent with the results of histological analysis. Neuroinflammation-associated impairment in motor behavior and cognitive function was also attenuated in the LCN2-deficient mice, as determined by the rotarod performance test, fatigue test, open-field test, and object recognition task. These findings suggest that LCN2 is an M1-amplifier in brain microglial cells."

https://openalex.org/W2035695619,"Obesity is a predictor of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. One consequence of obesity is dyslipidemia characterized by high blood triglycerides. It has been proposed that oxidative stress, driven by utilization of lipids for energy, contributes to these diseases. The effects of oxidative stress are mitigated by an endogenous antioxidant enzyme network, but little is known about its response to high fat utilization. Our experiments used a multiplexed quantitative proteomics method to measure antioxidant enzyme expression in heart tissue in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. This experiment showed a rapid and specific up-regulation of catalase protein, with subsequent assays showing increases in activity and mRNA. Catalase, traditionally considered a peroxisomal protein, was found to be present in cardiac mitochondria and significantly increased in content and activity during high fat feeding. These data, coupled with the fact that fatty acid oxidation enhances mitochondrial H(2)O(2) production, suggest that a localized catalase increase is needed to consume excessive mitochondrial H(2)O(2) produced by increased fat metabolism. To determine whether the catalase-specific response is a common feature of physiological conditions that increase blood triglycerides and fatty acid oxidation, we measured changes in antioxidant expression in fasted versus fed mice. Indeed, a similar specific catalase increase was observed in mice fasted for 24 h. Our findings suggest a fundamental metabolic process in which catalase expression is regulated to prevent damage while preserving an H(2)O(2)-mediated sensing of diet composition that appropriately adjusts insulin sensitivity in the short term as needed to prioritize lipid metabolism for complete utilization."
https://openalex.org/W2014019546,"IL-27 consists of the cytokine subunit p28 and the non-signaling α-receptor EBI3. p28 was shown to additionally act via the non-signaling membrane-bound IL-6 α-receptor (IL-6R) as an agonistic cytokine but also as a gp130 β-receptor antagonist, leading to inhibition of IL-6 signaling. Here, we developed a strategy for bacterial expression, purification, and refolding of murine p28. We show that p28 did not interfere with IL-6- or IL-27-induced signaling, indicating that p28 has no antagonistic properties. Moreover, we demonstrate that murine p28 acts as an agonistic cytokine via the murine and human IL-6R, indicating that p28 exhibits no species specificity. p28 was able to induce p28-trans-signaling via the soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R), a characteristic property that was initially described for trans-signaling of IL-6 via the sIL-6R. Of notice, p28/sIL-6R trans-signaling was inhibited by the IL-6 trans-signaling antagonist, soluble gp130. At higher concentrations, p28 but not IL-6 was able to induce signaling even in the absence of IL-6R or EBI3. Although IL-27 signals via a heterodimer of the β-receptor chains gp130 and Wsx-1, p28/IL-6R specifically recruits two gp130 β-receptor chains for signal transduction. The binding of p28 to a gp130/Wsx-1 heterodimer or a gp130 homodimer is highly selective and controlled by a novel molecular switch induced by EBI3 or IL-6R, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2030402778,"Calcium (Ca2+) is a key second messenger in eukaryotes and regulates diverse cellular processes, most notably via calmodulin (CaM). In Arabidopsis thaliana, IQD1 (IQ67 domain 1) is the founding member of the IQD family of putative CaM targets. The 33 predicted IQD proteins share a conserved domain of 67 amino acids that is characterized by a unique arrangement of multiple CaM recruitment motifs, including so-called IQ motifs. Whereas IQD1 has been implicated in the regulation of defense metabolism, the biochemical functions of IQD proteins remain to be elucidated. In this study we show that IQD1 binds to multiple Arabidopsis CaM and CaM-like (CML) proteins in vitro and in yeast two-hybrid interaction assays. CaM overlay assays revealed moderate affinity of IQD1 to CaM2 (Kd ∼ 0.6 μm). Deletion mapping of IQD1 demonstrated the importance of the IQ67 domain for CaM2 binding in vitro, which is corroborated by interaction of the shortest IQD member, IQD20, with Arabidopsis CaM/CMLs in yeast.

Significance: This work provides novel insight into IQD function and a framework to study plant kinesin regulation. In plants, intracellular Ca2+ plays a pivotal role as a second messenger for the regulation of numerous developmental processes and responses to a myriad of abiotic cues and biotic challenges (1Dodd A.N.

Typically, Ca2+ signaling pathways comprise three stages. Stimulus-specific and dynamic fluctuations of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, characterized by amplitude, frequency, and spatial distribution, are generated during the initial phase by interplay of voltage- and ligand-activated Ca2+-permeable channels (influx) and Ca2+-ATPases/antiporters (efflux) to restore resting cytosolic Ca2+ levels. The resulting Ca2+ signatures are decoded by Ca2+-sensor proteins that undergo conformational changes upon Ca2+ binding followed by dynamic interactions with target proteins to regulate downstream responses during the final stage of the transduction process (1Dodd A.N. Kudla J. Sanders D. The language of calcium signaling.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2010; 61: 593-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 2DeFalco T.A. Bender K.W. Snedden W.A. Breaking the code.

Roles of calcium- and calcium/calmodulin-regulated gene expression.Plant Cell. 2011; 23: 2010-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). About 250 Ca2+ sensor proteins have been identified in the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana, which monitor Ca2+ fluctuations via their helix-loop-helix EF hand motifs and can be grouped into Ca2+ sensor responders or Ca2+ sensor relays (4Day I.S.

The former are bifunctional proteins capable of directly transducing the Ca2+ signal via their intrinsic catalytic activity. For example, Ca2+-dependent protein kinases, a family of 34 members in Arabidopsis, couple Ca2+ binding motifs with a kinase domain to catalyze Ca2+-triggered phosphorylation of target proteins (6Hrabak E.M. Chan C.W. Gribskov M. Harper J.F. Choi J.H. Halford N. Kudla J. Luan S. Nimmo H.G. Sussman M.R. Thomas M. Walker-Simmons K. Zhu J.K. Harmon A.C.

CaM-like proteins (CMLs), and calcineurin B-like proteins. The Ca2+ sensor relays undergo conformational changes upon Ca2+ binding and transduces the signal via interaction with terminal Ca2+ responders, thereby modulating the biochemical activities of these target proteins and establishing a large number of cellular processes and subsequent plant responses (1Dodd A.N. Kudla J. Sanders D. The language of calcium signaling.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2010; 61: 593-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 2DeFalco T.A. Bender K.W. Snedden W.A. Breaking the code.

In Arabidopsis, 10 calcineurin B-like protein sensor proteins interact specifically in a Ca2+-dependent fashion with a single family of 26 SNF1-like Ser/Thr kinases, known as calcineurin B-like protein-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). Current data indicate that calcineurin B-like protein-CIPK interaction networks provide a signaling module for integrating plant responses to an array of environmental stimuli (7Weinl S. Kudla J.

On the other hand, CaMs and CMLs, encoded by 7 CaM and 50 CML genes in Arabidopsis, regulate a broad range of structurally diverse Ca2+ responders that are predicted to exceed 700 target proteins (9Reddy A.S.

These include, among other functional categories, proteins implicated in generating Ca2+ signatures, enzymes in signaling and metabolic pathways, and transcriptional regulators (11Reddy V.S.

The CaM-interacting domains of target proteins usually consist of a short basic amphiphilic helix (12–30 residues). Three consensus CaM recruitment motifs are currently known, although not all functionally characterized CaM binding domains contain these specific motifs: the IQ motif mediating Ca2+-independent CaM retention and two related motifs, termed 1-5-10 and 1-8-14, facilitating Ca2+-dependent CaM interaction (13Rhoads A.R.

We previously identified a novel class of putative CaM target proteins in A. thaliana that we called the IQD family (16Levy M. Wang Q. Kaspi R. Parrella M.P. Abel S. Arabidopsis IQD1, a novel calmodulin-binding nuclear protein, stimulates glucosinolate accumulation and plant defense.Plant J. 2005; 43: 79-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 17Abel S. Savchenko T. Levy M. Genome-wide comparative analysis of the IQD gene families in Arabidopsis thalianaOryza sativa.BMC Evol Biol. 2005; 5: 72Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The common feature of its 33 members is the presence of a plant-specific, central domain of 67 conserved amino acid residues (referred to as the IQ67 domain), which is defined by a unique and repetitive arrangement of the three consensus CaM recruitment motifs (1–3 copies each). IQD proteins are structurally diverse with respect to computed molecular mass (12–87 kDa) but are relatively uniform at the physicochemical level, sharing some properties reminiscent of RNA binding proteins, such as a basic isoelectric point (pI ∼ 10.3) and a high content of Arg/Lys (∼17%) and Ser (∼12%) residues (17Abel S. Savchenko T. Levy M. Genome-wide comparative analysis of the IQD gene families in Arabidopsis thalianaOryza sativa.BMC Evol Biol. 2005; 5: 72Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Another hallmark of the Arabidopsis IQD family is a high fraction of homeologous gene pairs (∼45% of the paralogous gene set), which is characteristic of protein families with conserved functions in regulatory multiprotein complexes (17Abel S. Savchenko T. Levy M. Genome-wide comparative analysis of the IQD gene families in Arabidopsis thalianaOryza sativa.BMC Evol Biol. 2005; 5: 72Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, given the large size of the extant plant IQD gene families, which originated during the early evolution of land plants and their likely conserved functions (17Abel S. Savchenko T. Levy M. Genome-wide comparative analysis of the IQD gene families in Arabidopsis thalianaOryza sativa.BMC Evol Biol. 2005; 5: 72Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), surprisingly little is known about the biological roles of IQD proteins. The first described IQD gene was functionally identified in a screen for Arabidopsis mutants with altered production of glucosinolates (16Levy M. Wang Q. Kaspi R. Parrella M.P. Abel S. Arabidopsis IQD1, a novel calmodulin-binding nuclear protein, stimulates glucosinolate accumulation and plant defense.Plant J. 2005; 43: 79-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), a class of secondary metabolites in crucifers whose degradation products possess profound biological activities ranging from plant defense to cancer prevention in humans (18Grubb C.D. Abel S. Glucosinolate metabolism and its control.Trends Plant Sci. 2006; 11: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 19Halkier B.A. Gershenzon J. Biology and biochemistry of glucosinolates.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 303-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar). IQD1 binds to vertebrate CaM in a Ca2+-dependent fashion, which is also true for IQD20, the smallest member of the Arabidopsis IQD family, consisting only of the IQ67 domain at its C terminus and a short N-terminal extension (16Levy M. Wang Q. Kaspi R. Parrella M.P. Abel S. Arabidopsis IQD1, a novel calmodulin-binding nuclear protein, stimulates glucosinolate accumulation and plant defense.Plant J. 2005; 43: 79-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 17Abel S. Savchenko T. Levy M. Genome-wide comparative analysis of the IQD gene families in Arabidopsis thalianaOryza sativa.BMC Evol Biol. 2005; 5: 72Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). An IQD1∼GFP fusion protein localizes to the cell nucleus, and histochemical analysis of IQD1Pro::GUS lines reveals patterns of reporter gene expression consistent with tissue-specific glucosinolate biosynthesis. Overexpression of IQD1 in Arabidopsis stimulates glucosinolate accumulation and defense against herbivores. Because IQD1 expression is induced by mechanical stimuli, IQD1 was proposed to act as a nuclear factor that integrates intracellular Ca2+ signals to regulate defense metabolism in response to biotic challenge (16Levy M. Wang Q. Kaspi R. Parrella M.P. Abel S. Arabidopsis IQD1, a novel calmodulin-binding nuclear protein, stimulates glucosinolate accumulation and plant defense.Plant J. 2005; 43: 79-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Besides IQD1, another member of the Arabidopsis family, IQD22, has been implicated as a negative regulator of the response to the plant hormone gibberellin (20Zentella R. Zhang Z.L. Park M.

Global analysis of della direct targets in early gibberellin signaling in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 3037-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), and a role for IQD12 from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) has recently been revealed (21Xiao H. Jiang N. Schaffner E. Stockinger E.J. van der Knaap E.

The sun quantitative trait locus is associated with tomato fruit shape and causes long, atypically formed fruits when compared with the wild ancestor. A genetic approach identified IQD12 to be a major gene responsible for fruit shape variation and showed that its high expression level, caused by retrotransposon-mediated IQD12 duplication, leads to extremely elongated tomato fruits via altered cell division patterns (21Xiao H.

Whereas first biological processes regulated by IQD proteins are beginning to emerge that include aspects of plant development or defense response, their molecular functions and underlying signaling pathways remain to be elucidated. Here, we expand our studies on Arabidopsis IQD1 and describe its direct interaction with a select set of Arabidopsis CaM/CMLs. Using a genetic yeast two-hybrid interaction screen, we identified kinesin light chain-related-1 (KLCR1) as an IQD1 binding protein in Arabidopsis, which prompted us to reinvestigate the subcellular localization of IQD1 at high resolution. Interestingly, our data demonstrate that IQD1 localizes not only to the cell nucleus but also associates with the microtubular network to which IQD1 recruits KCLR1 as well as CaM2. For the first time our work provides insight into the biochemical function of IQD1 and related proteins as putative Ca2+-CaM-regulated scaffold proteins, which may facilitate cellular transport of cargo complexes via microtubule-associated kinesin motor proteins. The bacterial vector for expression of recombinant IQD1 fused to an N-terminal T7 epitope tag was previously described (16Levy M. Wang Q. Kaspi R. Parrella M.P. Abel S. Arabidopsis IQD1, a novel calmodulin-binding nuclear protein, stimulates glucosinolate accumulation and plant defense.Plant J. 2005; 43: 79-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Similarly, full-length cDNA fragments encoding the predicted Arabidopsis IQD20 and IQD33 proteins were generated by RT-PCR using gene-specific primers and mobilized into the pET21a(+) vector (BamHI/EcoRI), which provides the N-terminal T7 tag (Novagen, Madison, WI). To allow for production of recombinant proteins with two epitope tags (N-terminal T7 tag, C-terminal His6 tag), full-length IQD1 and partial cDNAs encoding truncated IQD1 polypeptides were generated by PCR and mobilized into the pET21a(+) vector (EcoRI/HindIII). Production of recombinant Arabidopsis CaM1 (identical with CaM4), CaM2 (identical with CaM3 and CaM5), CML8, and CML9 fused to the C-terminal Strep-tag II was supported by pASK-IBA3 bacterial vectors (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc., The Woodlands, TX), which were obtained from C. Köhler (23Köhler C. Neuhaus G. Characterisation of calmodulin binding to cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels from Arabidopsis thaliana.FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The authenticity of all cloned cDNA fragments was verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21a(pLysS) DE3 cells (Novagen) for protein expression and purification using standard protocols. Expression of recombinant proteins was induced by 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for at least 4 h at 37 °C. Bacterial cells were lysed by sonication in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) for most experiments or in buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100) for nucleic acid binding experiments. Both buffers contained 1 tablet of complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) per 50 ml volume. Bacterial lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were used for SDS-PAGE, protein purification, immunoblot analysis, and in vitro interaction assays. Cell extracts of bacteria expressing C-terminal Strep-tag II fusions of Arabidopsis CaM1, CaM2, CML8, or CML9 were incubated with Strep-Tactin beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Genosys Biotechnologies) to allow for binding of recombinant CaM/CML proteins. Aliquots of Strep-Tactin beads with bound CaM/CMLs (60 μl) were washed with buffer A containing 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA. Bacterial lysates expressing T7-tagged IQD1 (400 μl) were added to the prewashed beads in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA. The suspensions were rotated at room temperature for 30 min. After incubation, the beads were washed 4 times with 1 ml of buffer A containing 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling the bead pellets for 2 min in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. Proteins were resolved on 10% (w/v) SDS- polyacrylamide gels (24Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Pierce). Co-sedimentation of T7-tagged IQD1 was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated T7-Tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen) as previously described (16Levy M. Wang Q. Kaspi R. Parrella M.P. Abel S. Arabidopsis IQD1, a novel calmodulin-binding nuclear protein, stimulates glucosinolate accumulation and plant defense.Plant J. 2005; 43: 79-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The coding region of Arabidopsis CaM2 was cloned into vector pENTR1A (Invitrogen) using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. The resulting entry vector was used to mobilize the CaM2 cDNA insert by LR recombination (according to the manufacturer's protocol) into vector pEXP1-DEST (Invitrogen) to facilitate in vitro synthesis of CaM2 containing a His6-tag, the Xpress epitope tag, and the enterokinase recognition site. The cell-free protein synthesis system Expressway Cell-Free E. coli Expression System (Invitrogen) and [35S]methionine (Met) (Amersham Biosciences) were used for the production of recombinant [35S]Met-labeled CaM2 according to the manufacturer's protocol. The radiolabeled CaM2 was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) under native conditions and digested in situ with enterokinase EKMaxTM (Invitrogen) overnight at 37 °C. The released CaM2 was collected in the flow-through fraction. The concentration of the purified protein was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficient values calculated by the ExPASy ProtPARAM tool (13,980 m−1 cm−1 for the CaM2 fusion after enterokinase cleavage). Purified CaM2 was used as a probe after determination of its concentration and specific radioactivity (about 0.5 × 106 cpm/μg). Expressed T7- and His6-tagged full-length IQD proteins and truncated IQD1 polypeptides were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography under native conditions (according to the manufacturer's protocol). The proteins (0.5 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% gels) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight with 5% BSA in TBST buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and subsequently overlaid with 2 mm [35S]Met-labeled CaM2 in the same buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA. The membranes were washed 4 times for 15 min in the respective buffers without probe. Bound CaM2 was detected by phosphorimaging analysis (GE Healthcare). For determining saturation curves of CaM2 binding, full-length T7-IQD1-His6 recombinant protein was purified by Ni-NTA chromatography under native conditions and spotted on nitrocellulose membrane discs (100 pmol) that were sequentially incubated in blocking solution (see above) for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation in blocking solution containing different concentrations of [35S]Met-labeled CaM2 in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA (2 h at room temperature). After washing in TBST buffer without radiolabeled CaM2, the amount of bound CaM2 was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Not more than 0.1% of added [35S]Met-labeled CaM2 remained at the membrane at any condition. Specific CaM2 binding was calculated as the difference between total binding and nonspecific binding (filter discs without recombinant IQD1 protein). The Kd value was determined by Scatchard plot analysis. For yeast two-hybrid interaction assays, the coding sequences of IQD1 and IQD20 were amplified by PCR and cloned into the bait pGBT9 vector (SpeI/EcoRI) to create plasmids encoding IQD protein fusions with the Gal4 DNA binding domain (23Köhler C. Neuhaus G. Characterisation of calmodulin binding to cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels from Arabidopsis thaliana.FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding fusions of Arabidopsis CaMs and CMLs with the Gal4 activation domain were obtained either from C. Köhler (23Köhler C. Neuhaus G. Characterisation of calmodulin binding to cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels from Arabidopsis thaliana.FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (pGAD-CaM1, pGAD-CaM2, pGAD-CML8, pGAD-CML9) or were constructed by PCR and insert mobilization into the prey pGAD424 vector for CaM6 (XhoI/EcoRI), CML5 (XhoI/EcoRI), CML11 (BamHI/XhoI), CML13 (XhoI/EcoRI), CML17 (BamHI/EcoRI), CML19 (XhoI/EcoRI), CML27 (XhoI/NotI), CML36 (XhoI/EcoRI), and CML49 (XhoI/EcoRI). Plasmid templates for Arabidopsis CaMs and CMLs cDNAs were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Columbus, OH). Full-length cDNAs of IQD1 and IQD20 were also inserted into pGAD424 (BamHI/EcoRI) to test for in vivo homodimerization. All plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmid pGAD-CNGC2 served as a positive control for CaM interaction and was provided by C. Köhler (23Köhler C. Neuhaus G. Characterisation of calmodulin binding to cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels from Arabidopsis thaliana.FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The bait and prey vectors to be tested for interaction of the fusion proteins were co-transformed into yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strain HF7c using the standard lithium acetate method (25Kim J. Harter K. Theologis A. Protein-protein interactions among the Aux/IAA proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 11786-11791Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions were scored and quantified by the ability to activate two reporter genes under control of the GAL4 promoter: HIS3 and lacZ. The HIS3 reporter activity was monitored by testing transformants on synthetic dropout (SD) medium lacking histidine (His). Yeast colonies selected for the presence of the bait and prey plasmids were grown in liquid SD medium (−Leu-Trp) to an optical density of 1 A600. Serial 10-fold dilutions (10 μl) were spotted on growth permissive (−Leu-Trp) and growth restrictive (−Leu-Trp-His) SD agar plates. LacZ reporter gene expression (β-galactosidase activity) was determined using O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate (25Kim J. Harter K. Theologis A. Protein-protein interactions among the Aux/IAA proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 11786-11791Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), and the galactosidase activity was calculated as Miller units: A420 × 1000/A600 × assay time (min) × assay volume (ml). An A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia) flower cDNA library was constructed using the BD-Matchmaker Library Construction and Screening Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Poly(A)+ RNA (100 ng) prepared from flower tissues was used for cDNA synthesis according to the manufacturer's instruction. First strand cDNA was amplified by long distance PCR using the BD Advantage 2 PCR kit (Clontech). The purified cDNA was then fused to the GAL4 activation domain of the bait pGADT7-Rec (Clontech) expression vector by recombination in AH109 yeast strain, which yielded more than four million original transformants. The yeast two-hybrid cDNA library screening was performed using the BD Matchmaker Two-hybrid System (BD Biosciences). Full-length cDNA of IQD1 was amplified by PCR and cloned into the GAL4 DNA binding domain of pGBKT7 (BD Biosciences), generating bait plasmid pGBKT7-IQD1, which was sequenced to ensure fidelity of the construct. The bait construct was introduced into yeast strain Y187 using the lithium acetate transformation method (BD Biosciences Yeast Protocols Handbook). Screens were carried out by mating according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Briefly, an overnight culture of strain Y187 expressing pGBKT7"
https://openalex.org/W2004909339,"Specific cleavage of the transmembrane molecule, CUB domain-containing protein-1 (CDCP1), by plasmin-like serine proteases induces outside–in signal transduction that facilitates early stages of spontaneous metastasis leading to tumor cell intravasation, namely cell escape from the primary tumor, stromal invasion and transendothelial migration. We identified active β1 integrin as a biochemical and functional partner of the membrane-retained 70-kDa CDCP1 fragment, newly generated from its full-length 135-kDa precursor though proteolytic cleavage by serine proteases. Both in cell cultures and in live animals, active β1 integrin complexed preferentially with functionally activated, phosphorylated 70-kDa CDCP1. Complexing of β1 integrin the 70-kDa with CDCP1 fragment induced intracellular phosphorylation signaling, involving focal adhesion kinase-1 (FAK) and PI3 kinase (PI3K)-dependent Akt activation. Thus, inhibition of FAK/PI3K activities by specific inhibitors as well as short-hairpin RNA downregulation of β1 integrin significantly reduced FAK/Akt phosphorylation under conditions where CDCP1 was processed by serine proteases, indicating that FAK/PI3K/Akt pathway operates downstream of cleaved CDCP1 complexed with β1 integrin. Furthermore, this complex-dependent signaling correlated positively with high levels of tumor cell intravasation and dissemination. Correspondingly, abrogation in vivo of CDCP1 cleavage either by unique cleavage-blocking monoclonal antibody 10-D7 or by inhibition of proteolytic activity of plasmin-like serine proteases with aprotinin prevented β1 integrin/CDCP1 complexing and downstream FAK/Akt signaling concomitant with significant reduction of stromal invasion and spontaneous metastasis. Therefore, β1 integrin appears to serve as a motility-regulating partner mediating cross-talk between proteolytically cleaved, membrane-retained CDCP1 and members of FAK/PI3K/Akt pathway. This CDCP1 cleavage-induced signaling cascade constitutes a unique mechanism, independent of extracellular matrix remodeling, whereby a proteolytically cleaved CDCP1 regulates in vivo locomotion and metastasis of tumor cells through β1 integrin partnering. Our findings indicate that CDCP1 cleavage, occurring at the apex of a β1 integrin/FAK/PI3K/Akt signaling cascade, may represent a therapeutic target for CDCP1-positive cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2064194149,"Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) play important roles in the life cycle of Plasmodium falciparum and other apicomplexan parasites. CDPKs commonly have an N-terminal kinase domain (KD) and a C-terminal calmodulin-like domain (CamLD) with calcium-binding EF hands. The KD and CamLD are separated by a junction domain (JD). Previous studies on Plasmodium and Toxoplasma CDPKs suggest a role for the JD and CamLD in the regulation of kinase activity. Here, we provide direct evidence for the binding of the CamLD with the P3 region (Leu(356) to Thr(370)) of the JD in the presence of calcium (Ca(2+)). Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis of conserved hydrophobic residues in the JD (F363A/I364A, L356A, and F350A) abrogates functional activity of PfCDPK1, demonstrating the importance of these residues in PfCDPK1 function. Modeling studies suggest that these residues play a role in interaction of the CamLD with the JD. The P3 peptide, which specifically inhibits the functional activity of PfCDPK1, blocks microneme discharge and erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum merozoites. Purfalcamine, a previously identified specific inhibitor of PfCDPK1, also inhibits microneme discharge and erythrocyte invasion, confirming a role for PfCDPK1 in this process. These studies validate PfCDPK1 as a target for drug development and demonstrate that interfering with its mechanistic regulation may provide a novel approach to design-specific PfCDPK1 inhibitors that limit blood stage parasite growth and clear malaria parasite infections."
https://openalex.org/W1984128917,"Kinase/phosphatase balance governs cardiac excitability in health and disease. Although detailed mechanisms for cardiac kinase regulation are established, far less is known regarding cardiac protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulation. This is largely due to the complexity of the PP2A holoenzyme structure (combinatorial assembly of three subunit enzyme from >17 subunit genes) and the inability to segregate ""global"" PP2A function from the activities of multiple ""local"" holoenzyme populations. Here we report that PP2A catalytic, regulatory, and scaffolding subunits are tightly regulated at transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels to tune myocyte function at base line and in disease. We show that past global read-outs of cellular PP2A activity more appropriately represent the collective activity of numerous individual PP2A holoenzymes, each displaying a specific subcellular localization (dictated by select PP2A regulatory subunits) as well as local specific post-translational catalytic subunit methylation and phosphorylation events that regulate local and rapid holoenzyme assembly/disassembly (via leucine carboxymethyltransferase 1/phosphatase methylesterase 1 (LCMT-1/PME-1). We report that PP2A subunits are selectively regulated between human and animal models, across cardiac chambers, and even within specific cardiac cell types. Moreover, this regulation can be rapidly tuned in response to cellular activation. Finally, we report that global PP2A is altered in human and experimental models of heart disease, yet each pathology displays its own distinct molecular signature though specific PP2A subunit modulatory events. These new data provide an initial view into the signaling pathways that govern PP2A function in heart but also establish the first step in defining specific PP2A regulatory targets in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2012628363,"Despite the fundamental pathophysiological importance of β-catenin in tumor progression, the mechanism underlying its final transcriptional output has been partially elucidated. Here, we report that β-arrestin-1 (β-arr1) is an epigenetic regulator of endothelin (ET)-1-induced β-catenin signaling in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). In response to ET A receptor (ETAR) activation by ET-1, β-arr1 increases its nuclear translocation and direct binding to β-catenin. This in turn enhanced β-catenin nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity, which was prevented by expressing a mutant β-arr1 incapable of nuclear distribution. β-arr1–β-catenin interaction controls β-catenin target gene expressions, such as ET-1, Axin 2, Matrix metalloproteinase 2, and Cyclin D1, by promoting histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) dissociation and the recruitment of p300 acetyltransferase on these promoter genes, resulting in enhanced H3 and H4 histone acetylation, and gene transcription, required for cell migration, invasion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These effects are abrogated by β-arr1 silencing or by mutant β-arr1, as well as by β-catenin or p300 silencing, confirming that nuclear β-arr1 forms a functional complex capable of regulating epigenetic changes in β-catenin-driven invasive behavior. In a murine orthotopic model of metastatic human EOC, silencing of β-arr1 or mutant β-arr1 expression, as well as ETAR blockade, inhibits metastasis. In human EOC tissues, β-arr1–β-catenin nuclear complexes are selectively enriched at β-catenin target gene promoters, correlating with tumor grade, confirming a direct in vivo β-arr1–β-catenin association at specific set of genes involved in EOC progression. Collectively, our study provides insights into how a β-arr1-mediated epigenetic mechanism controls β-catenin activity, unraveling new components required for its nuclear function in promoting metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2038489646,"Upregulation of lipogenesis is a hallmark of cancer and blocking the lipogenic pathway is known to cause tumor cell death by apoptosis. However, the exact role of lipogenesis in tumor initiation is as yet poorly understood. We examined the expression profile of key lipogenic genes in clinical samples of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of breast cancer and found that these genes were significantly upregulated in DCIS. We also isolated cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) from DCIS.com cell line using cell surface markers (CS24(-)CD44(+)ESA(+)) and found that this cell population has significantly higher tumor-initiating ability to generate DCIS compared with the non-stem-like population. Furthermore, the CSCs showed significantly higher level of expression of all lipogenic genes than the counterpart population from non-tumorigenic breast cancer cell line, MCF10A. Importantly, ectopic expression of SREBP1, the master regulator of lipogenic genes, in MCF10A significantly enhanced lipogenesis in stem-like cells and promoted cell growth as well as mammosphere formation. Moreover, SREBP1 expression significantly increased the ability of cell survival of CSCs from MCF10AT, another cell line that is capable of generating DCIS, in mouse and in cell culture. These results indicate that upregulation of lipogenesis is a pre-requisite for DCIS formation by endowing the ability of cell survival. We have also shown that resveratrol was capable of blocking the lipogenic gene expression in CSCs and significantly suppressed their ability to generate DCIS in animals, which provides us with a strong rationale to use this agent for chemoprevention against DCIS."
https://openalex.org/W1981346198,"Besides its established functions in intermediary metabolism and developmental processes, the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ (PPARβ/δ) has a less defined role in tumorigenesis. In the present study, we have identified a function for PPARβ/δ in cancer cell invasion. We show that two structurally divergent inhibitory ligands for PPARβ/δ, the inverse agonists ST247 and DG172, strongly inhibit the serum- and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-induced invasion of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells into a three-dimensional matrigel matrix. To elucidate the molecular basis of this finding, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and microarray analyses, which identified the gene encoding angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) as the major transcriptional PPARβ/δ target in MDA-MB-231 cells, previously implicated in TGFβ-mediated tumor progression and metastatic dissemination. We show that the induction of ANGPTL4 by TGFβ and other oncogenic signals is strongly repressed by ST247 and DG172 in a PPARβ/δ-dependent fashion, resulting in the inhibition of ANGPTL4 secretion. This effect is attributable to these ligands' ability to induce a dominant transcriptional repressor complex at the site of transcription initiation that blocks preinitiation complex formation through an histone deacetylase-independent, non-canonical mechanism. Repression of ANGPTL4 transcription by inverse PPARβ/δ agonists is functionally linked to the inhibition of cancer cell invasion into a three-dimensional matrix, as (i) invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells is critically dependent on ANGPTL4 expression, (ii) recombinant ANGPTL4 stimulates invasion, and (iii) reverses the inhibitory effect of ST247 and DG172. These findings indicate that a PPARβ/δ-ANGPTL4 pathway is involved in the regulation of tumor cell invasion and that its pharmacological manipulation by inverse PPARβ/δ agonists is feasible."
https://openalex.org/W1971980767,"Abnormal expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been implicated in carcinogenesis. Here we report a novel BCR (breakpoint cluster region)-ABL (c-abl oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase)/GATA1/microRNA-138 (miR-138) circuitry in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). miR-138 expression is downregulated in K562 cells and primary CML samples, which is restored after imatinib treatment. The tumor suppressor activity of miR-138 is demonstrated by the induction of cell cycle arrest at G0/G1, inhibition of cell proliferation and colony forming unit granulocyte-macrophage colony formation and enhanced imatinib-induced apoptosis in K562 and Ku812 cells overexpressing miR-138. Moreover, overexpression of miR-138 led to the downregulation of BCR-ABL. Based on luciferase assay, ABL and BCR-ABL are shown to be the target genes regulated by miR-138. Furthermore, miR-138 binding to ABL was shown to localize to the coding region instead of 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTR) of ABL mRNA. In addition, CCND3 is another target of miR-138, which represses CCND3 expression by binding to its 3′-UTR. Finally, upregulation of miR-138 upon imatinib treatment is associated with the enhancement of GATA1 activity, which binds to the miR-138 promoter. In conclusion, miR-138 is a tumor suppressor miRNA underexpressed in CML. miR-138 represses expression of both BCR-ABL and CCND3 via binding to the coding region and 3′-UTR, respectively. miR-138 expression is activated by GATA1, which in turn is repressed by BCR-ABL. Therefore, miR-138, by virtue of a BCR-ABL/GATA1/miR-138 circuitry, is a tumor suppressor miRNA implicated in the pathogenesis of CML and its clinical response to imatinib."
https://openalex.org/W1985648203,"The Met receptor tyrosine kinase, found to be constitutively activated in many tumors, has become a leading target for cancer therapy. Disruptions in Met downregulation have been associated with aggressive tumor progression with several therapeutic strategies addressing this aspect of Met biology. Castias B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) E3 ligase-mediated degradation, which attenuates Met signaling via ligand-dependent Met internalization, is a major negative regulator of Met expression. It is believed that one of the mechanisms by which the therapeutic anti-Met antibodies induce cancer cell death in Met overexpressing tumors is via internalization and subsequent degradation of Met from the cell surface. However, a previously reported Met-targeting antibody demonstrated intrinsic agonistic activity while being capable of inducing Cbl-mediated degradation of Met, suggesting that Cbl-mediated degradation requires receptor activation and impedes therapeutic application. We have developed a potent and selective bivalent Met-targeting antibody (SAIT301) that invokes Met degradation using an alternative regulator LRIG1. In this report, we demonstrate that LRIG1 mediates degradation of Met by SAIT301 and this degradation does not require Met activation. Furthermore, SAIT301 was able to downregulate Met and dramatically inhibit growth of tumors with low or no Cbl expression, as well as tumors with Met exon 14 deletion that prevents Met binding to Cbl. In summary, we demonstrate the enhanced therapeutic potential of a novel tumor-inhibiting anti-Met antibody, SAIT301, which utilizes a Cbl-independent, LRIG1-mediated Met degradation pathway and thereby avoids the agonism that limits the effectiveness of previously reported anti-Met antibodies."

Conclusion: MamK shares features of structure and assembly with other bacterial actin homologs, and it has some unique features of its own. Significance: This work will guide future studies to unravel molecular mechanisms underlying MamK function in vivo. Research over the last couple of decades has demonstrated that bacteria are not devoid of subcellular organization and that fine-tuned cellular processes govern their growth and development. Much of the appreciation for the level of complexity in bacteria has come with the discovery of homologs of the eukaryotic cytoskeletal proteins actin, tubulin, and intermediate filaments in bacteria (reviewed in Refs. 1Cabeen M.T. Jacobs-Wagner C. The bacterial cytoskeleton.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2010; 44: 365-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2Ingerson-Mahar M. Gitai Z. A growing family.

The structure and function of bacterial actin homologs.Cold Spring Harbor Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a000364Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As in eukaryotes, these fulfill vital functions for cell growth, DNA segregation, and cell shape determination in bacteria. Actin, one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotes, is critical for many cellular functions (4Dominguez R. Holmes K.C. Actin structure and function.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2011; 40: 169-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 5Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Actin, a central player in cell shape and movement.Science. 2009; 326: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). It shows a remarkable level of sequence conservation across eukaryotic species (6Galkin V.E. VanLoock M.S. Orlova A. Egelman E.H.

Biol. 2002; 12: 570-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Sheterline P. Clayton J. Sparrow J. Actin.Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 1-103PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, bacterial actin sequences are highly divergent and share only little primary sequence similarity to actin. Recent bioinformatic analysis suggests that there are more than 40 different families of bacterial actins (8Derman A.I. Becker E.C. Truong B.D. Fujioka A. Tucey T.M. Erb M.L. Patterson P.C. Pogliano J. Phylogenetic analysis identifies many uncharacterized actin-like proteins (Alps) in bacteria. Regulated polymerization, dynamic instability, and treadmilling in Alp7A.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 534-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A unifying characteristic of actin and bacterial actins is the actin-fold, a conserved core structure that creates a nucleotide-binding and hydrolysis site (9Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. An ATPase domain common to prokaryotic cell cycle proteins, sugar kinases, actin, and Hsp70 heat shock proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

One of the key features of actin is its ability to transition between monomeric and filamentous states. One of the main factors regulating this transition is the hydrolysis of nucleotides such as ATP by filamentous actin where hydrolysis provides an energy source for a conformational switch (4Dominguez R. Holmes K.C. Actin structure and function.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2011; 40: 169-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 9Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A.

In addition, a large number of accessory protein factors can influence this transition. Similar to actin, bacterial actins form filamentous structures, and the majority of studies thus far have concentrated on a few select groups, such as the functionally distinct MreB and ParM proteins (11Jensen R.B. Gerdes K. Partitioning of plasmid R1. The ParM protein exhibits ATPase activity and interacts with the centromere-like ParR-parC complex.J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 12Jones L.J. Carballido-López R. Errington J. Control of cell shape in bacteria: helical, actin-like filaments in Bacillus subtilis.Cell. 2001; 104: 913-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). MreB is widely conserved and functions in cell shape determination in rod-shaped bacteria. Through its interaction with cell membrane and cell wall-associated proteins, it influences new cell wall synthesis (13Salje J. van den Ent F. de Boer P. Löwe J. Direct membrane binding by bacterial actin MreB.Mol. Cell. 2011; 43: 478-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Recent in vivo studies suggest that MreB forms highly dynamic structures along the inner membrane of cells (14Domínguez-Escobar J. Chastanet A. Crevenna A.H. Fromion V. Wedlich-Söldner R. Carballido-López R. Processive movement of MreB-associated cell wall biosynthetic complexes in bacteria.Science. 2011; 333: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 15Garner E.C. Bernard R. Wang W. Zhuang X. Rudner D.Z. Mitchison T. Coupled, circumferential motions of the cell wall synthesis machinery and MreB filaments in B. subtilis.Science. 2011; 333: 222-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 16van Teeffelen S. Wang S. Furchtgott L. Huang K.C. Wingreen N.S. Shaevitz J.W. Gitai Z. The bacterial actin MreB rotates, and rotation depends on cell-wall assembly.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 15822-15827Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). It is unclear to what level MreB filament assembly and disassembly is a factor in in vivo MreB dynamics. ParM functions in the efficient segregation of low copy plasmids between daughter cells. ParM filaments exhibit dynamic instability in vitro, i.e. assembly and rapid catastrophic disassembly, that is distinct from the behavior of actin and is more microtubule-like (17Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Mullins R.D. Dynamic instability in a DNA-segregating prokaryotic actin homolog.Science. 2004; 306: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This dynamic behavior is important for ParM function because it provides a mechanism to “scan” for the plasmid. Upon “finding” the plasmid, by binding the ParR-parC complex, ParM filaments are stabilized, and their behavior transitions from dynamic instability to steady filament growth, enabling active movement of the plasmid (18Salje J. Gayathri P. Löwe J. The ParMRC system. Molecular mechanisms of plasmid segregation by actin-like filaments.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although research on MreB and ParM has provided molecular and mechanistic insights into the function of these proteins, the function and properties of the majority of bacterial actins remain unexplored. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that the considerable sequence diversity within bacterial actins translates into functional, structural, and behavioral differences. Here, we performed a detailed analysis of the in vitro properties of the bacterial actin MamK from Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1, hereafter referred to as AMB-1. MamK proteins form their own phylogenetic group within the bacterial actins and have been implicated in the organization of subcellular organelles in magnetotactic bacteria (19Draper O. Byrne M.E. Li Z. Keyhani S. Barrozo J.C. Jensen G. Komeili A. MamK, a bacterial actin, forms dynamic filaments in vivo that are regulated by the acidic proteins MamJ and LimJ.Mol.

Magnetosomes are cell membrane invaginations organized by the actin-like protein MamK.Science. 2006; 311: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). This phylogenetically diverse group of bacteria can form intracellular structures called magnetosomes, which are inner membrane invaginations that direct the formation of magnetic crystals. A single cell contains a number of magnetosomes that are aligned into one or multiple chains in the cytoplasm that together act as a compass needle. The possession of a magnetosome chain results in passive alignment of the bacteria to geo-magnetic field lines, which is thought to make the search for optimal growth conditions more efficient (21Bazylinski D.A. Frankel R.B. Magnetosome formation in prokaryotes.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 22Jogler C. Schüler D. Genomics, genetics, and cell biology of magnetosome formation.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 63: 501-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 23Komeili A. Molecular mechanisms of compartmentalization and biomineralization in magnetotactic bacteria.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2012; 36: 232-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The alignment of magnetosomes into well organized chains is dependent on MamK, and high resolution electron cryotomography studies have revealed that MamK likely forms filaments that flank magnetosomes in vivo (20Komeili A. Li Z. Newman D.K. Jensen G.J. Magnetosomes are cell membrane invaginations organized by the actin-like protein MamK.Science. 2006; 311: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 24Katzmann E. Müller F.D. Lang C. Messerer M. Winklhofer M. Plitzko J.M. Schüler D. Magnetosome chains are recruited to cellular division sites and split by asymmetric septation.Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 82: 1316-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although genetic evidence suggests a role for MamK in magnetosome alignment, it is yet unknown if MamK filaments function in the establishment or the maintenance of a proper magnetosome chain. A study in the related organism Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense MSR-1 suggests a role for MamK in the active positioning of magnetosomes during cell division (24Katzmann E. Müller F.D. Lang C. Messerer M. Winklhofer M. Plitzko J.M. Schüler D. Magnetosome chains are recruited to cellular division sites and split by asymmetric septation.Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 82: 1316-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated, using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assays, that MamK-GFP forms dynamic filaments in vivo. Furthermore, an intact nucleotide-binding site and two redundant proteins, MamJ and LimJ, regulate filament dynamics in vivo (19Draper O. Byrne M.E. Li Z. Keyhani S. Barrozo J.C. Jensen G. Komeili A. MamK, a bacterial actin, forms dynamic filaments in vivo that are regulated by the acidic proteins MamJ and LimJ.Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 82: 342-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To ultimately understand the role of MamK in cells, both in vivo and in vitro insights into MamK behavior is highly desirable. Several groups have previously studied the in vitro behavior of recombinantly expressed MamK. In an important first study, Taoka et al. (25Taoka A. Asada R. Wu L.F. Fukumori Y. Polymerization of the actin-like protein MamK, which is associated with magnetosomes.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 8737-8740Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) demonstrated that recombinant MamK can form filamentous structures in vitro. Filamentous bundles could be visualized by EM upon addition of ATPγS, 2The abbreviations used are: ATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)TIRFtotal internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, but not upon addition ATP, suggesting that MamK filaments disassembled prior to visualization due to ATP hydrolysis. Similar observations were made by Sonkaria et al. (26Sonkaria S. Fuentes G. Verma C. Narang R. Khare V. Fischer A. Faivre D. Insight into the assembly properties and functional organisation of the magnetotactic bacterial actin-like homolog, MamK.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e34189Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, Rioux et al. (27Rioux J.B. Philippe N. Pereira S. Pignol D. Wu L.F. Ginet N. A second actin-like MamK protein in Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 encoded outside the genomic magnetosome island.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e9151Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reported that MamK filament assembly occurred in the absence of ATP. These earlier studies presented valuable new insights; however, they provided only limited, and somewhat contradicting, information about assembly and filament dynamics and the role of nucleotides for MamK. Furthermore, these studies employed His-tagged derivatives of MamK that could exhibit different in vitro properties than the native untagged protein. adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Here, we concentrated our efforts toward a more complete understanding of the in vitro properties and behavior of MamK. This is the first in-depth analysis of the assembly and filament architecture of an untagged MamK protein. We show that MamK assembles into filaments in an ATP-dependent manner and that filament disassembly occurs with very slow kinetics in low salt conditions. Near physiological levels of potassium or mutations in the protein's ATPase active site of the protein abolish this disassembly behavior. These results substantiate a model in which MamK filaments, unlike the inherently unstable bacterial actin ParM, are stable in their default state and require accessory factors to become dynamic. Moreover, we show by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) that MamK assembles into filaments with unique features, further highlighting the structural diversity of bacterial actins. The mamK gene was amplified from genomic DNA of M. magneticum AMB-1 using a primer set that enabled the cloning of the gene into a pET29a vector using NdeI and HindIII restriction sites (forward primer, GCCATATGAGTGAAGGTGAAGGCC; reverse primer, CAAGCTTACGAGCCGGAGACGTCTC), creating MamK expression plasmid pAK420 (KanR). This plasmid was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis to create mutant MamKE143A (pAK598) (forward primer, GCCCTAGTGGTGTCCGCCCCGTTCATGGTCGGC; reverse primer, GCCGACCATGAACGGGGCGGACACCACTAGGGC). Sequences of plasmids were verified, and plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells that already contained plasmid pLysS (CmR) encoding for T7 lysozyme to lower the background expression levels. Transformants were selected on LB medium in the presence of both kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml). For MamK expression, cells were grown overnight in LB medium in the presence of both antibiotics at 30 °C. Overnight cultures were diluted into fresh medium to a starting of OD650 nm ∼0.05 and grown to OD650 nm ∼0.6, and isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, cultures were incubated at 20 °C overnight. Cells were harvested and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, and pellets were frozen at −80 °C. Cell pellets were thawed and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) processed through a French press, and cell debris was removed at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Ammonium sulfate cuts at 20% saturation were taken, and precipitates were resuspended in depolymerization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT) and incubated for 30 min. Subsequently protein was ultracentrifuged at 115,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to remove MamK polymers and aggregates, and a second ammonium sulfate cut (20%) was performed on the supernatant. Protein was resuspended in ice-cold depolymerization buffer and dialyzed extensively into polymerization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 10% glycerol; 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol was included for dialysis) at 4 °C for 8–10 h. The glycerol level was adjusted to 30%, and protein aliquots were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The procedure described above yields highly pure MamK protein samples, and we routinely employed this purification protocol. For nucleotide hydrolysis assays, we additionally gel-filtered MamK over a Superdex 200 matrix equilibrated in polymerization buffer. The presence of glycerol during the purification procedure and during experiments was necessary because we experienced that MamK frequently aggregated in its absence, especially in higher ionic strength buffers and at high protein concentrations. To perform experiments, MamK samples were thawed on ice, and the buffer was exchanged with G25 gel filtration resin (PD10 or Nap5 columns) equilibrated with polymerization buffer without reducing reagents. concentrations were calculated using a calculated molar extinction coefficient of 18,910 m−1 cm−1 at A280 nm. DTT was added to MamK samples to a final concentration of 1 mm, and samples were ultracentrifuged at 115,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C prior to experiments. Various other buffers were used in this study as detailed under “Results.” Negative stain EM samples were prepared by applying polymerized MamK to carbon-coated grids after glow-discharging, washing away unbound sample with water, and staining with 0.75% uranyl formate (28Ohi M. Li Y. Cheng Y. Walz T. Negative staining and image classification–Powerful tools in modern electron microscopy.Biol. Proced. Online. 2004; 6: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Negative stain EM was performed on a Tecnai T12 Spirit LaB6 microscope (FEI Co.) operating at 120 kV, and images were acquired on a 4k × 4k CCD camera (Gatan, Inc.). Cryo-EM samples were prepared by applying polymerized MamK to glow-discharged C-FLAT holey-carbon grids, blotting in a Vitrobot (FEI Co.), and rapidly plunging into liquid ethane. A preliminary cryo-EM data set was obtained on a Tecnai F20 with a field emission gun operating at 200 kV with an 8k × 8k CCD camera (Tietz, Inc.) with a pixel size of 0.94 Å/pixel. The preliminary data set was used for determining helical symmetry parameters and testing for parallel versus antiparallel orientation of the two strands. The data used in the final reconstruction was obtained on a Titan Krios operating at 200 kV with a 4k × 4k Gatan Ultrascan camera with a pixel size of 1.09 Å/pixel. Total electron dose was in the range of 25–30 e−/Å2, and images were acquired over a defocus range of −1.4 to −3.5 μm (average −2.5 μm). Defocus parameters for each micrograph were determined with CTFFIND (29Mindell J.A. Grigorieff N. Accurate determination of local defocus and specimen tilt in electron microscopy.J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 142: 334-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Contrast transfer function correction was achieved by applying a Wiener filter to the entire micrograph. Relatively straight lengths of helix were defined in the boxer program of the EMAN software suite (30Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. EMAN. Semiautomated software for high resolution single-particle reconstructions.J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). Preliminary reconstructions were determined by iterative helical real space reconstruction, performed essentially as described by Egelman (31Egelman E.H. The iterative helical real space reconstruction method. Surmounting the problems posed by real polymers.J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and Sasche et al. (32Sachse C. Chen J.Z. Coureux P.D. Stroupe M.E. Fändrich M. Grigorieff N. High-resolution electron microscopy of helical specimens: a fresh look at tobacco mosaic virus.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 812-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), using SPIDER (33Frank J. Three-dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 1-342Google Scholar) for projection matching and back projection, and the programs hsearch_lorentz and himpose (34Egelman E.H. A robust algorithm for the reconstruction of helical filaments using single-particle methods.Ultramicroscopy. 2000; 85: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In all cases, a low pass filtered featureless cylinder was used as the initial model. The dataset used for initial characterization had a total of 11,476 overlapping segments, ∼480 Å long, which included ∼23,400 unique MamK subunits. Several independent reconstructions were calculated starting with different initial symmetry parameters, and in each case the helical symmetry converged to 23.4° azimuthal rotation and 53.1 Å axial rise per helical repeat (supplemental Fig. S10C). A second dataset was collected that included 7936 overlapping helical segments, ∼370 Å long, which contained ∼31,744 unique MamK subunits. The images were binned 2-fold for the reconstruction, with a final pixel size of 2.18 Å/pixel. In this case, 30 rounds of reconstruction were calculated with SPIDER as described above, followed by five rounds of refinement using the ihrsr routines in SPARX (35Behrmann E. Tao G. Stokes D.L. Egelman E.H. Raunser S. Penczek P.A. Real-space processing of helical filaments in SPARX.J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 177: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Visualization of the cryo-EM reconstructions, fitting of the MamK homology model, and figure generation were performed with Chimera (36Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. UCSF Chimera–a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis.J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (27950) Google Scholar). Reference-free classification and averaging was carried out on images binned 4-fold, to 3.76 Å/pixel. The EMAN program startnrclasses was used for the classification (30Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. EMAN. Semiautomated software for high resolution single-particle reconstructions.J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). A homology model of MamK was generated from the crystal structure of Thermotoga maritima MreB (Protein Data Bank code 1JCF) (37van den Ent F. Amos L.A. Löwe J. Prokaryotic origin of the actin cytoskeleton.Nature. 2001; 413: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) using the program MODELLER (38Fiser A. Sali A. Modeller: generation and refinement of homology-based protein structure models.Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). Several hundred sequences of MamK and MreB homologs were found by BLAST search (39Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. Basic local alignment search tool.J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70353) Google Scholar), and a multiple sequence alignment was generated with all the sequences using MAFFT (40Katoh K. Misawa K. Kuma K. Miyata T. MAFFT. A novel method for rapid multiple sequence alignment based on fast Fourier transform.Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3059-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (9336) Google Scholar). The pairwise alignment between MamK and T. maritima MreB was extracted from the multiple sequence alignment and used as input for MODELLER. To assess MamK polymerization, protein samples were equilibrated to room temperature for 10 min before addition of nucleotide. Protein with nucleotide and control reactions were incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and the samples were spun at ∼140,000 × g at room temperature in a Beckman Airfuge for 20 min. Supernatant and pellet fractions were recovered and analyzed by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (12% gels). Gels were stained with the GelCode Blue reagent (Thermo Scientific). MamK bulk polymerization behavior was assessed by right angle light scattering on a Horiba Fluoromax-4 instrument with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 314 nm and a 0.5-nm slit width. Samples were equilibrated to room temperature for 5 min, and a stable light scattering signal was verified before the addition of 100 mm nucleotide stock solutions defined as t0. Common to all measurements was a delay of ∼4–6 s to manually mix the reactions before starting to record light scattering changes. All measurements were performed in triplicate unless stated otherwise, and all experiments of the same type were performed on the same day. To calculate critical concentrations, maximum intensity values were plotted against the protein concentration used in the assay (corrected for dilution), and the critical concentration was considered as the x-intercept in the plot. Maximum intensity values were derived from background subtracted data (intensity value at t0) fitted with a sigmoidal function (Boltzmann) that described the data well (adjusted R2 values >0.94). Release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) was quantitated using a coupled enzyme assay allowing continuous measurements (EnzCheck, Molecular Probes). The assay was based on the enzymatic conversion of substrate molecule MESG in the presence of Pi resulting in a product with a simultaneous shift of maximum absorbance to 360 nm. A360 nm values were converted to Pi by using a phosphate standard. Reactions were performed using polymerization buffer specified above and not the buffer provided with the EnzCheck kit. Data were collected on an Ultrospec 2100 Pro spectrophotometer controlled by the SWIFT II software (GE Healthcare). All measurements were performed in triplicate. Similar to eukaryotic actin, for bacterial actins the nucleotide state (NTP or NDP) of the protein was central for understanding their assembly and dynamics. Previous studies on MamK-His provided somewhat contradictory information about the role of nucleotides on MamK behavior. For our studies, we recombinantly expressed MamK fro"
https://openalex.org/W2034677367,"The heterodimeric nuclear factor (NF) 90/NF45 complex (NF90/NF45) binds nucleic acids and is a multifunctional regulator of gene expression. Here we report that depletion of NF90/NF45 restores the expression of the p53 and p21 proteins in cervical carcinoma cells infected with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs). Knockdown of either NF90 or NF45 by RNA interference led to greatly elevated levels of p53 and p21 proteins in HPV-derived HeLa and SiHa cells but not in other cancerous or normal cell lines. In HeLa cells, p21 messenger-RNA (mRNA) increased concomitantly but the level of p53 mRNA was unaffected. RNA interference directed against p53 prevented the induction of both proteins. These results indicated that the upregulation of p21 is due to p53-dependent transcription, whereas p53 is regulated post-transcriptionally. Proteasome-mediated turnover of p53 is accelerated by the HPV E6 and cellular E6AP proteins. We therefore examined the hypothesis that this pathway is regulated by NF90/NF45. Indeed, depletion of NF90 attenuated the expression of E6 RNA and inhibited transcription from the HPV early promoter, revealing a new role for NF90/NF45 in HPV gene expression. The transcription inhibition was largely independent of the reduction of P-TEFb (positive transcription elongation factor b) levels caused by NF90 depletion. Consistent with p53 derepression, NF90/NF45-depleted HeLa cells displayed elevated poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and susceptibility to camptothecin-induced apoptosis. We conclude that high-risk strains of HPV utilize the cellular NF90/NF45 complex for viral E6 expression in infected cervical carcinoma cell lines. Interference with NF90/NF45 function could assist in controlling cervical carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W1976007658,"Osteopontin (OPN), which is highly expressed in malignant glioblastoma (GBM), possesses inflammatory activity modulated by proteolytic cleavage by thrombin and plasma carboxypeptidase B2 (CPB2) at a highly conserved cleavage site. Full-length OPN (OPN-FL) was elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from all cancer patients compared with noncancer patients. However, thrombin-cleaved OPN (OPN-R) and thrombin/CPB2-double-cleaved OPN (OPN-L) levels were markedly increased in GBM and non-GBM gliomas compared with systemic cancer and noncancer patients. Cleaved OPN constituted ∼23 and ∼31% of the total OPN in the GBM and non-GBM CSF samples, respectively. OPN-R was also elevated in GBM tissues. Thrombin-antithrombin levels were highly correlated with cleaved OPN, but not OPN-FL, suggesting that the cleaved OPN fragments resulted from increased thrombin and CPB2 in this extracellular compartment. Levels of VEGF and CCL4 were increased in CSF of GBM and correlated with the levels of cleaved OPN. GBM cell lines were more adherent to OPN-R and OPN-L than OPN-FL. Adhesion to OPN altered gene expression, in particular genes involved with cellular processes, cell cycle regulation, death, and inflammation. OPN and its cleaved forms promoted motility of U-87 MG cells and conferred resistance to apoptosis. Although functional mutation of the RGD motif in OPN largely abolished these functions, OPNRAA-R regained significant cell binding and signaling function, suggesting that the SVVYGLR motif in OPN-R may substitute for the RGD motif if the latter becomes inaccessible. OPN cleavage contributes to GBM development by allowing more cells to bind in niches where they acquire anti-apoptotic properties.Background: Osteopontin (OPN) is highly expressed in glioblastoma (GBM) and possesses inflammatory activity modulated by proteolytic cleavage.Results: Cleaved OPN was increased in GBM and led to more adhesion of GBM cells. OPN conferred resistance to apoptosis in GBM cells.Conclusion: Increased osteopontin proteolysis increased GBM cell resistance to apoptosis.Significance: OPN cleavage links coagulation and inflammation providing a favorable niche for GBM development. Osteopontin (OPN), which is highly expressed in malignant glioblastoma (GBM), possesses inflammatory activity modulated by proteolytic cleavage by thrombin and plasma carboxypeptidase B2 (CPB2) at a highly conserved cleavage site. Full-length OPN (OPN-FL) was elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from all cancer patients compared with noncancer patients. However, thrombin-cleaved OPN (OPN-R) and thrombin/CPB2-double-cleaved OPN (OPN-L) levels were markedly increased in GBM and non-GBM gliomas compared with systemic cancer and noncancer patients. Cleaved OPN constituted ∼23 and ∼31% of the total OPN in the GBM and non-GBM CSF samples, respectively. OPN-R was also elevated in GBM tissues. Thrombin-antithrombin levels were highly correlated with cleaved OPN, but not OPN-FL, suggesting that the cleaved OPN fragments resulted from increased thrombin and CPB2 in this extracellular compartment. Levels of VEGF and CCL4 were increased in CSF of GBM and correlated with the levels of cleaved OPN. GBM cell lines were more adherent to OPN-R and OPN-L than OPN-FL. Adhesion to OPN altered gene expression, in particular genes involved with cellular processes, cell cycle regulation, death, and inflammation. OPN and its cleaved forms promoted motility of U-87 MG cells and conferred resistance to apoptosis. Although functional mutation of the RGD motif in OPN largely abolished these functions, OPNRAA-R regained significant cell binding and signaling function, suggesting that the SVVYGLR motif in OPN-R may substitute for the RGD motif if the latter becomes inaccessible.

https://openalex.org/W1973373558,"The cytoskeletal protein talin, an actin- and β-integrin tail-binding protein, plays an important role in cell migration by promoting integrin activation and focal adhesion formation. Here, we show that talin is a substrate for cathepsin H (CtsH), a lysosomal cysteine protease with a strong aminopeptidase activity. Purified active CtsH sequentially cleaved a synthetic peptide representing the N terminus of the talin F0 head domain. The processing of talin by CtsH was determined also in the metastatic PC-3 prostate cancer cell line, which exhibits increased expression of CtsH. The attenuation of CtsH aminopeptidase activity by a specific inhibitor or siRNA-mediated silencing significantly reduced the migration of PC-3 cells on fibronectin and invasion through Matrigel. We found that in migrating PC-3 cells, CtsH was co-localized with talin in the focal adhesions. Furthermore, specific inhibition of CtsH increased the activation of α(v)β(3)-integrin on PC-3 cells. We propose that CtsH-mediated processing of talin might promote cancer cell progression by affecting integrin activation and adhesion strength."
https://openalex.org/W2084388133,"Plant aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) enzymes are capable of catalyzing either decarboxylation or decarboxylation-deamination on various combinations of aromatic amino acid substrates. These two different activities result in the production of arylalkylamines and the formation of aromatic acetaldehydes, respectively. Variations in product formation enable individual enzymes to play different physiological functions. Despite these catalytic variations, arylalkylamine and aldehyde synthesizing AAADs are indistinguishable without protein expression and characterization. In this study, extensive biochemical characterization of plant AAADs was performed to identify residues responsible for differentiating decarboxylation AAADs from aldehyde synthase AAADs. Results demonstrated that a tyrosine residue located on a catalytic loop proximal to the active site of plant AAADs is primarily responsible for dictating typical decarboxylase activity, whereas a phenylalanine at the same position is primarily liable for aldehyde synthase activity. Mutagenesis of the active site phenylalanine to tyrosine in Arabidopsis thaliana and Petroselinum crispum aromatic acetaldehyde synthases primarily converts the enzymes activity from decarboxylation-deamination to decarboxylation. The mutation of the active site tyrosine to phenylalanine in the Catharanthus roseus and Papaver somniferum aromatic amino acid decarboxylases changes the enzymes decarboxylation activity to a primarily decarboxylation-deamination activity. Generation of these mutant enzymes enables the production of unusual AAAD enzyme products including indole-3-acetaldehyde, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, and phenylethylamine. Our data indicates that the tyrosine and phenylalanine in the catalytic loop region could serve as a signature residue to reliably distinguish plant arylalkylamine and aldehyde synthesizing AAADs. Additionally, the resulting data enables further insights into the mechanistic roles of active site residues."
https://openalex.org/W1967429227,"Kras-induced non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma is the major subtype of lung cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. Using a lung cancer mouse model that expresses a cre-mediated KrasG12D mutant, we identified a critical role for the cell surface molecule CD44 in mediating cell proliferation downstream of oncogenic Kras signaling. The deletion of CD44 attenuates lung adenocarcinoma formation and prolongs the survival of these mice. Mechanistically, CD44 is required for the activation of Kras-mediated signaling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and thus promotes tumor cell proliferation. Together, these results reveal an unrecognized role for CD44 in oncogenic Kras-induced lung adenocarcinoma and suggest that targeting CD44 could be an effective strategy for halting Kras-dependent carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W1972735840,"NEU3 sialidase, a key enzyme in ganglioside metabolism, is activated under hypoxic conditions in cultured skeletal muscle cells (C2C12). NEU3 up-regulation stimulates the EGF receptor signaling pathway, which in turn activates the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α), resulting in a final increase of cell survival and proliferation. In the same cells, stable overexpression of sialidase NEU3 significantly enhances cell resistance to hypoxia, whereas stable silencing of the enzyme renders cells more susceptible to apoptosis. These data support the working hypothesis of a physiological role played by NEU3 sialidase in protecting cells from hypoxic stress and may suggest new directions in the development of therapeutic strategies against ischemic diseases, particularly of the cerebro-cardiovascular system."
https://openalex.org/W1976719421,"Activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1 (ACK1) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase linked to cellular transformation. The aberrant regulation of ACK1 promotes tumor progression and metastasis. Therefore, ACK1 is regarded as a valid target in cancer therapy. Seven in absentia homolog (SIAH) ubiquitin ligases facilitate substrate ubiquitinylation that targets proteins to the proteasomal degradation pathway. Here we report that ACK1 and SIAH1 from Homo sapiens interact in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Protein-protein interaction studies and protein degradation analyses using deletion and point mutants of ACK1 verify that SIAH1 and the related SIAH2 interact with ACK1. The association between SIAHs and ACK1 depends on the integrity of a highly conserved SIAH-binding motif located in the far C-terminus of ACK1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the interaction of ACK1 with SIAH1 and the induction of proteasomal degradation of ACK1 by SIAH1 are independent of ACK1's kinase activity. Chemical inhibitors blocking proteasomal activity corroborate that SIAH1 and SIAH2 destabilize the ACK1 protein by inducing its proteasomal turnover. This mechanism apparently differs from the lysosomal pathway targeting ACK1 after stimulation with the epidermal growth factor. Our data also show that ACK1, but not ACK1 mutants lacking the SIAH binding motif, has a discernable negative effect on SIAH levels. Additionally, knockdown approaches targeting the SIAH2 mRNA uncover specifically that the induction of SIAH2 expression, by hormonally-induced estrogen receptor (ER) activation, decreases the levels of ACK1 in luminal human breast cancer cells. Collectively, our data provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms modulating ACK1 and they position SIAH ubiquitin ligases as negative regulators of ACK1 in transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2002005301,"One of the most conserved features of all cancers is a profound reprogramming of cellular metabolism, favoring biosynthetic processes and limiting catalytic processes. With the acquired knowledge of some of these important changes, we have designed a combination therapy in order to force cancer cells to use a particular metabolic pathway that ultimately results in the accumulation of toxic products. This innovative approach consists of blocking lipid synthesis, at the same time that we force the cell, through the inhibition of AMP-activated kinase, to accumulate toxic intermediates, such as malonyl-coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. This results in excess of oxidative stress and cancer cell death. Our new therapeutic strategy, based on the manipulation of metabolic pathways, will certainly set up the basis for new upcoming studies defining a new paradigm of cancer treatment."

It has been demonstrated to be a serine esterase with sequence similarity to the family CE-3 carbohydrate esterases of the CAZy classification system. In the absence of a three-dimensional structure for any Ape, further knowledge of its structure and function relationship is dependent on modeling and kinetic studies. In this study, we predicted Neisseria gonorrhoeae Ape1a to be an SGNH hydrolase with an adopted α/β-hydrolase fold containing a central twisted four-stranded parallel β-sheet flanked by six α-helices with the putative catalytic triad, Asp-366, His-369, and Ser-80 appropriately aligned within a pocket. The role of eight invariant and highly conserved residues localized to the active site was investigated by site-directed replacements coupled with kinetic characterization and binding studies of the resultant engineered enzymes. Based on these data and theoretical considerations, Gly-236 and Asn-268 were identified as participating at the oxyanion hole to stabilize the tetrahedral species in the reaction mechanism, whereas Gly-78, Asp-79, His-81, Asn-235, Thr-267, and Val-368 are proposed to position appropriately the catalytic residues and participate in substrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W1970595154,"The transcription factor GLI2 has an important role in the transduction of Hedgehog signaling and thereby regulates tumorigenesis in a wide variety of human tumors. However, the mechanisms controlling GLI2 protein expression and stabilization are incompletely understood. In this study, we show that the mitogen-activated protein kinase MEK1 modulates GLI2 both at the mRNA and protein level. Constitutively activated MEK1 prolonged the half-life of GLI2 and increased its nuclear translocation, accompanied by attenuated ubiquitination of GLI2 protein. RSK2, a protein kinase lying downstream of MEK–ERK cascade, mimicked the effect of MEK on GLI2 stabilization. MEK1 and RSK2 failed to augment the half-life of GLI2 lacking GSK-3β phosphorylation sites, indicating that MEK–RSK stabilizes GLI2 by controlling targeting GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation and ubiquitination of GLI2. The significance of MEK–RSK stabilization was demonstrated in experiments showing that activation of MEK–RSK paralleled higher protein level of GLI2 in several multiple myelomas (MM) cells relative to normal B cells. Moreover, combined treatment with RSK and GLI inhibitors led to an enhanced apoptosis of MM cells. Thus, our results indicate that MEK–RSK cascade positively regulates GLI2 stabilization and represses its degradation via inhibiting GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation and ubiquitination of GLI2."
https://openalex.org/W2151771215,"p21-activated kinase-1 (Pak1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a key role in mediating antigen-stimulated extracellular calcium influx and degranulation in mast cells. Another isoform in this kinase family, Pak2, is expressed at very high levels in mast cells, but its function is unknown. Here we show that Pak2 loss in murine bone marrow-derived mast cells, unlike loss of Pak1, induces increased antigen-mediated adhesion, degranulation, and cytokine secretion without changes to extracellular calcium influx. This phenotype is associated with an increase in RhoA-GTPase signaling activity to downstream effectors, including myosin light chain and p38MAPK, and is reversed upon treatment with a Rho-specific inhibitor. Pak2, but not Pak1, negatively regulates RhoA via phosphorylation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1 at an inhibitory site, leading to increased GEF-H1 microtubule binding and loss of RhoA stimulation.

Significance: Pak2 has an opposing role to Pak1 in mast cell degranulation. Mast cells are immune cells that reside in nearly all vascularized tissues, particularly in tissues in close contact with the outside environment. Mast cells are one of the first immune cells to interact with foreign allergens, and it is therefore critical that these cells respond immediately to antigen by secreting biologically active mediators to promote or down-regulate inflammation (1Galli S.J. Tsai M. IgE and mast cells in allergic disease.Nat. Med. 2012; 18: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Secretion or degranulation is regulated by antigenic challenge to the high affinity receptor for the Fc fragment of IgE (FcϵRI). Upon antigenic challenge, a signaling cascade of phosphatases and kinases is activated that coordinates dynamic changes in the cytoskeleton to promote immediate release of preformed granules via vesicle translocation and fusion to the plasma membrane (1Galli S.J.

However, despite extensive structural similarities, particularly in the protein kinase domain, hints are beginning to emerge that these two isoforms have distinct functions. Gene knock-outs in mice reveal that loss of Pak1 is well tolerated, with notable defects only in subsets of immune cells, such as mast cells and macrophages, whereas loss of Pak2 results in early embryonic lethality (9Hofmann C.

We previously reported that Pak1 loss in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) was associated with reduced MAPK phosphorylation (Erk1/2 and p38), resulting in impaired stem cell factor-mediated migration in vitro and in vivo (11McDaniel A.S.

Pak1 was found to positively regulate IgE-mediated degranulation via regulation of extracellular calcium influx through modulation of F-actin rearrangement (10Allen J.D. Jaffer Z.M. Park S.-J.

These studies suggested that Group A Paks play a positive role in mast cell secretion and would be beneficial targets in asthma-related diseases. In this study, we generated a conditional Pak2 knock-out animal to investigate the function of other Group A Paks in allergen-mediated secretion. Surprisingly, we found that Pak1 and Pak2 play distinct and, in some cases, opposing roles in mast cell secretion. In contrast to Pak1, we found that Pak2 is a negative regulator of secretion via phosphorylation and inactivation of GEF-H1, leading to RhoA GTPase inhibition. These studies establish vital but distinct roles for Pak1 and Pak2 in mast cell secretion. Syngeneic Pak2fl/fl mice on mixed background (sv129/C57Bl/6) were used for experimentation. Animal care and experimental procedures were conducted on a protocol approved by the Fox Chase Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Tail DNA was digested with DirectPCR lysis buffer (Viagen, Los Angeles, CA) for tails with proteinase K and used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) designed to amplify DNA fragments from the WT and targeted Pak1 and Pak2 alleles. For Pak1 genotyping, a common forward primer (5′-GCC CTT CAC AGG AGC TTA ATG A-3′) was used with a Pak1-specific reverse primer (5′-GAA AGG ACT GAA TCT AAT AGC A-3′) to amplify a 240-bp product from the WT allele and with a neo-specific reverse primer (5′-CAT TTG TCACGT CCT GCACGA-3′) to amplify a 360-bp product from the targeted allele. For Pak2fl/fl genotyping, the forward primer was 5′-ATCTTCCCAGGCTCCTGACA-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-TGAAGCTGCATCAATCTATTCTG-3′. WT mice demonstrate a 306-bp band, and floxed mice demonstrate a 391-bp band. A retroviral vector for Cre recombinase (MSCV-CRE-ERT2) under tamoxifen control was used to excise Pak2 (Addgene plasmid 22776) (15Kumar M.S. Pester R.E. Chen C.Y. Lane K. Chin C. Lu J. Kirsch D.G. Golub T.R. Jacks T. Dicer1 functions as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2700-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Cre-ERT2 contains Cre-recombinase fused to the ligand-binding domain of a mutated estrogen receptor, which recognizes tamoxifen or its derivative 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT). This construct permits tamoxifen-dependent Cre activity. Recombinant virus was produced by retroviral packaging into 293-FT cells and co-transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 with vectors pVPack gag-pol and pVPack eco (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Viral supernatant was collected 48 and 72 h after transfection. Transduction of bone marrow was performed within 1 week of extraction and performed by spin infection with 4 μg/ml Polybrene. At least two rounds of transduction were performed prior to the addition of puromycin for drug selection. 250 nm 4-HT was added to mature mast cells 4 days prior to experimentation. Western blot analysis confirmed deletion of Pak2 by 4 days. Whole-cell protein extracts after antigen stimulation were prepared by the addition of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10% glycerol, and Complete protease inhibitor (Sigma), clarified by centrifugation, and denatured with 1× SDS sample buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on a 4–20% gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to PVDF membrane. Blots were probed with anti-Pak1, anti-Pak2, anti-phospho-phospholipase Cγ1, anti-total phospholipase Cγ1, anti-phospho-myosin light chain 2, anti-total myosin light chain 2, anti-phospho-stathmin, anti-phospho-p38, anti-p38, anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-ERK1/2, and anti-GEF-H1 (all 1:1000, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). Anti-phospho-GEF-H1 (Ser-885) was a gift from Celine DerMardirossian. All blots were then visualized with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:10000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Films were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (EMD Millipore). Phosphorylated proteins were quantified by subjecting autoradiographs to densitometry (NIH ImageJ software) and calculated relative to total protein. Bands were normalized to background, and the ratio of background-corrected raw intensities of protein of interest/total protein was calculated. BMMCs were cultured in RPMI (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine, 1.5% 1 m HEPES, 2% penicillin/streptomycin, 5 ng/ml recombinant murine interleukin-3 (IL-3), and 10 ng/ml stem cell factor (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ). All cellular and biochemical assays used BMMCs that had been in culture between 4 and 10 weeks. All experiments were conducted using at least three independent lines from each genotype. BMMCs were sensitized in cytokine-free medium with 0.5 μg/ml anti-DNP IgE monoclonal antibody (clone SPE-7; Sigma-Aldrich) overnight and stimulated with 10 and 30 ng/ml dinitrophenyl conjugated to human serum albumin (DNP-HSA, 30–40 mol of DNP/mol HSA; Sigma-Aldrich) for degranulation assays and 100 ng/ml dinitrophenyl in phosphorylation and pulldown assays. c-Kit and FcϵRI expression were analyzed by fluorescence cytometry as described (16Yang F.-C.

Cells were blocked with unconjugated anti-FcγRII/III (BD Pharmingen) and stained with anti-DNP monoclonal antibody IgE clone SPE-7 (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-mouse CD 117 (c-Kit) phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody, and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgE (both BD Pharmingen) secondary antibody. Cells were washed and resuspended in 0.5% FBS, PBS buffer. Cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). BMMC degranulation was determined by β-hexosaminidase release as described previously (17Nishizumi H. Yamamoto T.

IgE-primed (see “Cell Culture and Activation”) BMMCs were suspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in HEPES-BSA buffer (10 mm HEPES buffer, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.05% BSA, pH 7.4) and then stimulated with 10 or 30 ng/ml DNP-HSA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 min at 37 °C. For receptor-independent stimulation, unsensitized cells were incubated in HEPES-BSA buffer and stimulated with 1 μm ionomycin for 45 min. The cell pellets were solubilized in HEPES-BSA buffer, 0.5% Triton X-100. β-Hexosaminidase release was measured in both the supernatants and the cell pellets by incubating with 4-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide (Sigma-Aldrich) in sodium citrate (pH 4.5) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Sodium carbonate/sodium bicarbonate buffer (0.1 m, pH 10) was used to stop the reaction, and absorbance was read at 405 nm. Degranulation was expressed as a percentage of β-hexosaminidase released = supernatant activity/total (supernatant plus pellet) activity × 100. Samples were assayed in triplicate. BMMC cytokine secretion was determined using ELISA for tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-6 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Cells were sensitized overnight in cytokine-free medium with 0.5 μg/ml anti-DNP IgE. Cells were washed and stimulated with 30 ng/ml DNP-HSA for 6 h. Supernatants were collected, and cytokine release was measured. Cytokine release was normalized to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin treatment. Recombinant glutathione S transferase (GST)-conjugated PAK CRIB domain was expressed from pGEX-CRIB, and Rhotekin RBD-GST beads were acquired from Millipore. Cells were sensitized overnight in anti-DNP IgE (Sigma) without cytokines and stimulated with 100 ng/ml DNP-HSA for 10 min at 37 °C. Lysates were incubated with CRIB-GST or RBD-GST beads for 45 min rotating at 4 °C, washed, and run out on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad). Immunoblots of lysates incubated with beads and input were probed for anti-RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Rac1 (BD Transduction Laboratories), or anti-Cdc42 (Cell Signaling). GTP-bound lane intensity was normalized to input lane intensity and calculated relative to unstimulated levels in wild-type cells using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). BMMCs were starved of cytokines and sensitized overnight with anti-DNP-IgE (0.5 μg/ml). Cells were washed in HEPES-BSA buffer and placed in wells of a 96-well black microtiter plate (5 × 104 cells/well). Wells were precoated with 0.2% gelatin for 1 h and washed, and serum was added for 1 h at room temperature. This procedure resulted in a fibronectin coating of the wells. After 30 min of rest, cells were stimulated with DNP-HSA (1 or 10 ng/ml) for 45 min. 10 min prior to the end of the assay, the membrane-permeable viability dye calcein-AM (2 μg/ml) (eBioscience) was loaded onto the cells. A PerkinElmer Life Sciences Envision plate reader was used to measure fluorescence at 530 nm. First, wells were read to obtain a total fluorescence, after which they were washed, and bound cells were measured. Background fluorescence was subtracted, and the percentage of adherence was calculated by taking adherent cell fluorescence as a percentage of total well calcein-AM fluorescence. At least three individual mice were used per group, and assays were run in triplicate. IgE-primed BMMCs were resuspended at 106 cells/ml in HEPES-BSA buffer containing Indo-1-AM (eBioscience) and probenecid at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were washed and resuspended at 106 cells/ml in HEPES-BSA buffer. Samples were warmed to 37 °C, and base-line fluorescence was measured for 1 min. 30 ng/ml DNP-HSA was added to the cells, and the change in fluorescence (420 nm Ca2+-bound, 510 nm Ca2+-free) was monitored using the JSAN flow cytometer for 6 min. Positive controls were measured by stimulation with 1 μm thapsigargin. Data were graphed using FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR) and also used to analyze peak calcium flux normalized to base-line levels. HEK293 were transfected with pCDNA3-GEF-H1-GFP (gift from Celine DerMardirossian) using Lipofectamine 2000. Protein was purified using anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and conjugated to protein A/G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Protein was treated with λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) prior to use in the kinase assay. Immunoprecipitated GEF-H1 was incubated with recombinant Pak2 (ProQinase, Freiburg, Germany) and ATP in kinase buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was fractionated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to PVDF membrane. Membranes were probed for phospho-Ser-885 GEF-H1 (a gift from Celine DerMardirossian) and total GEF-H1 (Cell Signaling). Previously, we reported that Pak1 was a positive regulator of antigen-mediated degranulation in BMMCs via regulation of extracellular calcium flux (10Allen J.D. Jaffer Z.M. Park S.-J. Burgin S. Hofmann C. Sells M.A. Chen S. Derr-Yellin E. Michels E.G. McDaniel A. Bessler W.K. Ingram D.A. Atkinson S.J. Travers J.B. Chernoff J. Clapp D.W. p21-activated kinase regulates mast cell degranulation via effects on calcium mobilization and cytoskeletal dynamics.Blood. 2009; 113: 2695-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A closely related isoform, Pak2, is expressed at much higher levels than Pak1 (Fig. 1A) in mast cells; thus, we assessed the function of this kinase in antigen-mediated degranulation. Because the deletion of the Pak2 gene is associated with embryonic lethality at approximately embryonic day 8 (12Smith S.D. Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Ridley A.J. PAK1-mediated activation of ERK1/2 regulates lamellipodial dynamics.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3729-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we made a conditional knock-out of this gene. A targeting vector was designed to flank exon 2 of Pak2 with loxP sites. To confirm that the Pak2 floxed alleles functioned as expected, bone marrow from Pak2flox/flox mice was infected with a tamoxifen-regulated Cre recombinase retrovirus (MSCV-Cre-ERT2). After maturation to mast cells, the cells were treated with 250 nm 4-HT for 4 days to excise Pak2. Protein extracts from these cells were immunoblotted and probed with anti-Pak2 antibodies (Fig. 1B). As expected, 4-HT-treated Cre-ERT2-infected cells showed near total loss of Pak2 protein. For comparison, immunoblots from Pak1−/− BMMCs are also shown. Deletion of either kinase did not affect protein levels of the other Pak isoform (data not shown). Bone marrow was cultured for 5 weeks with IL-3 and stem cell factor to derive mature mast cells. The development and maturation of these cells were measured using flow cytometry analysis of the cell surface receptors FcϵRI and c-Kit (CD117). Flow cytometry plots demonstrated over 90% FcϵRI+ c-Kit+ mature mast cells after 5 weeks of culture (Fig. 1C), irrespective of the presence or absence of Pak1 or Pak2 protein. Thus, neither Pak1 nor Pak2 is essential for full maturation of bone marrow into mast cells in vitro. To examine the physiological responses of Pak2-deficient mast cells in vitro, we measured antigen-mediated degranulation and cytokine secretion. Previously, Pak1 was identified to regulate antigen-mediated degranulation in vitro (10Allen J.D. Jaffer Z.M. Park S.-J. Burgin S. Hofmann C. Sells M.A. Chen S. Derr-Yellin E. Michels E.G. McDaniel A. Bessler W.K. Ingram D.A. Atkinson S.J. Travers J.B. Chernoff J. Clapp D.W. p21-activated kinase regulates mast cell degranulation via effects on calcium mobilization and cytoskeletal dynamics.Blood. 2009; 113: 2695-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To determine whether Pak2 shares these properties, Pak2-deleted mast cells were sensitized with 0.5 μg/ml anti-DNP IgE overnight. The level of degranulation was measured by the amount of β-hexosaminidase release (an enzyme present in mast cell preformed granules). Surprisingly, Pak2-deleted mast cells showed a significant increase in degranulation (p value < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) when compared with cells from the same mouse without Cre activation (infected with MSCV-Cre-ERT2; however, not given 4-HT) (Fig. 1D). Total enzyme content measured in the cell pellet was similar between Pak2fl/fl and Pak2−/− cells, indicating that Pak2 deletion had no effect on the amount of β-hexosaminidase present, only on the release of granules. This finding is in stark contrast to Pak1-deleted mast cells, which had reduced degranulation (p value < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), as reported previously (10Allen J.D. Jaffer Z.M. Park S.-J. Burgin S. Hofmann C. Sells M.A. Chen S. Derr-Yellin E. Michels E.G. McDaniel A. Bessler W.K. Ingram D.A. Atkinson S.J. Travers J.B. Chernoff J. Clapp D.W. p21-activated kinase regulates mast cell degranulation via effects on calcium mobilization and cytoskeletal dynamics.Blood. 2009; 113: 2695-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). To rule out nonspecific effects of Cre activation, Cre was activated in WT BMMCs and measured for degranulation. In these cells, no enhanced degranulation was observed (data not shown). We also tested the response to ionomycin, a calcium ionophore used to activate store-operated calcium channels and initiate degranulation independent of antigen, and demonstrated no differences between genotypes. (Fig. 1D). Thus, our data show that Pak1 and Pak2 play opposing roles in IgE-mediated degranulation in mast cells; Pak1 positively regulates and Pak2 negatively regulates degranulation. Activated mast cells also synthesize and secrete cytokines in response to antigen. We measured the release of IL-6 and TNF-α in FcϵRI-activated mast cells by ELISA and found that Pak1−/− BMMCs were defective in secretion of IL-6 (p value < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and TNF-α (p value < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), consistent with the defect in degranulation (Fig. 1E). Alternatively, Pak2−/− BMMCs demonstrated significantly enhanced cytokine secretion for IL-6 (p value < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and TNF-α (p value < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) (Fig. 1E). These results show that, as with degranulation, Pak1 and Pak2 play opposing roles in IgE-mediated secretion of cytokines from mast cells. The profound differences in regulation of degranulation between Pak1 and Pak2 in mast cells led us to examine differences along the signaling pathway leading to IgE-mediated degranulation. Antigen-induced phospholipase-Cγ1 (PLCγ1) activation leads to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in influx of extracellular calcium. Because neither loss of Pak1 nor loss of Pak2 was associated with alterations in phosphorylation of PLCγ1 at Tyr-783 (Fig. 2A), this lead us to examine downstream events such as calcium influx. FcϵRI signaling upon antigen stimulation results in calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum internal stores (first stage of Ca2+ mobilization) and subsequent prolonged influx of extracellular calcium (second stage of Ca2+ mobilization) through store-operated calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels in the plasma membrane. Cells from all genotypes were sensitized with anti-DNP IgE and loaded with calcium-binding dye Indo-AM, and influx of extracellular calcium was measured by flow cytometry analysis by measuring Ca2+-bound versus unbound Indo-AM after stimulation with antigen. When compared with their appropriate controls, Pak1-deleted BMMCs were significantly impaired for second stage calcium influx (Fig. 2, B and C; p value < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), but had normal first stage release from the endoplasmic reticulum with antigen stimulation (10Allen J.D. Jaffer Z.M. Park S.-J. Burgin S. Hofmann C. Sells M.A. Chen S. Derr-Yellin E. Michels E.G. McDaniel A. Bessler W.K. Ingram D.A. Atkinson S.J. Travers J.B. Chernoff J. Clapp D.W. p21-activated kinase regulates mast cell degranulation via effects on calcium mobilization and cytoskeletal dynamics.Blood. 2009; 113: 2695-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Pak2-deleted BMMCs, however, were not defective in calcium influx from antigen stimulation (Fig. 2, B and C). These differences identify a key distinction in mast cell regulation between Pak1 and Pak2 in FcϵRI-stimulated mast cells. These results collectively indicate that Pak1 and Pak2 play distinct roles in regulating calcium influx in FcϵRI-stimulated BMMCs. FcϵRI receptor activation in mast cells not only leads to changes in secretion of inflammatory mediators, but also leads to increased adhesion (18Thompson H.L. Burbelo P.D. Metcalfe D.D.

The innate immune response plays a critical role in fighting infection (1Kaufmann S.H.E. Medzhitov R. Simon G. The Innate Immune Response to Infection. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2004Crossref Google Scholar) but can also affect the pathogenesis of numerous diseases with an inflammatory component (2Chaudhuri N. Dower S.K.

Immunol. 2005; 17: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Evidence for the importance of innate immunity in host defense in humans comes from the identification of polymorphisms in innate immunity signaling genes that render those individuals highly susceptible to infection (6Picard C. Casanova J.L. Puel A. Infectious diseases in patients with IRAK-4, MyD88, NEMO, or IκBα deficiency.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2011; 24: 490-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The innate immune response can also affect the risk of many diseases with an inflammatory component ranging from atherosclerosis to arthritis to cancer to sepsis (3Cook D.N. Pisetsky D.S.

Thus, it is critical that the innate immune response be properly modulated, active when needed to fight infection, and inactive when not needed to prevent other diseases. Thus, genes that transduce innate immune signals have become targets for the development of therapeutics for numerous indications (11Connolly D.J. O'Neill L.A. New developments in Toll-like receptor targeted therapeutics.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2012; 12: 510-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and polymorphisms in those genes that affect disease risk could be used to develop diagnostic tests for personalized medicine (3Cook D.N. Pisetsky D.S. Schwartz D.A. Toll-like receptors in the pathogenesis of human disease.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 975-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). We have performed comparative genomics RNAi screens in Caenorhabditis elegans and mouse macrophages to identify novel, conserved regulators of innate immunity (12Alper S. Laws R. Lackford B.

The nematode C. elegans lacks an adaptive immune response, but it does have an innate immune response that involves production of antimicrobial genes to fight infection. Most but not all C. elegans pathogens infect the nematode digestive tract and induce the increased expression of antimicrobial genes in intestinal epithelial cells (13Irazoqui J.E.

Macrophages are key phagocytic innate immune cell that affect many diseases (28Burke B. Lewis C.E. The Macrophage. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford2002Google Scholar). Our hypothesis is that by identifying orthologous genes that affect innate immunity in multiple species, suggesting evolutionary conservation of their function, we can expect that these genes will likewise affect innate immunity and disease in humans. Using RNAi screens in these simple model systems, we have identified many candidate regulators of innate immunity (12Alper S. Laws R. Lackford B. Boyd W.A. Dunlap P. Freedman J.H. Schwartz D.A.

Identification of novel genes that mediate innate immunity using inbred mice.Genetics. 2009; 183: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To sort through these candidates and determine their possible function, we examined our candidates for potential protein-protein interactions using a C. elegans protein interaction database (12Alper S. Laws R. Lackford B. Boyd W.A. Dunlap P. Freedman J.H. Schwartz D.A. Identification of innate immunity genes and pathways using a comparative genomics approach.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7016-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This led to the discovery of a network of proteins that included several of our candidate innate immunity regulators. Here, we expand the analysis of this innate immunity protein interaction network to include interactions in multiple species (C. elegans, Drosophila, and humans). Using RNAi, we show that almost every gene in this network modulates the response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mouse macrophage cell lines. We then validated the importance of this network in vivo using available mutations in C. elegans and mice. Thus, this novel innate immunity protein interaction network should provide a valuable resource for further innate immunity and inflammatory disease studies. RNAi was performed largely as described previously (12Alper S. Laws R. Lackford B. Boyd W.A. Dunlap P. Freedman J.H. Schwartz D.A.

In brief, pools of four siRNA duplexes or individual siRNA duplexes (Dharmacon) were transfected into either of two mouse macrophage cell lines (J774A.1 or RAW264.7) using the Amaxa nucleofector 96-well shuttle according to the manufacturer's instructions. Negative control siRNAs used were either a pool of four siRNA duplexes that do not target any mouse gene (Dharmacon nontargeting pool 1) or a single siRNA duplex not targeting any gene (Dharmacon nontargeting siRNA 1). Cells were then plated at either 100,000 cells/well in a 96-well format for ELISAs or 250,000 cells per well in a 6-well format for qPCR 2The abbreviations used are: qPCRquantitative PCRPAMPpathogen-associated molecular patternBMDMbone marrow-derived macrophage. studies. 24 h after plating, the cells were exposed to the indicated pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) for 6 h. Escherichia coli O111:B4 LPS was from List Biological Laboratories; PAM3CSK4 was from Invivogen. The LPS dose of 20 ng/ml was chosen for RNAi experiments as this dose gave an essentially complete response without overwhelming the system. Six-hour exposures were used as this would capture rapidly induced cytokines such as TNFα and cytokines induced later such as IL-6 (32Medzhitov R. Horng T.

Following the exposures, cytokine production was monitored by ELISA (R&D Systems) on cell supernatants. The cells were then either subjected to viability analysis or were used to generate RNA for qPCR. quantitative PCR pathogen-associated molecular pattern bone marrow-derived macrophage. Viability of the cells was monitored by staining cells with fluorescein diacetate and measuring resultant fluorescence on a plate reader as described (33Fernández-Botran R. Větvička V. Methods in Cellular Immunology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2001: 8Google Scholar). For qPCR studies, RLT buffer was added directly to the cells, and RNA was purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). qPCR was then performed using the QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR assay kit (Qiagen) and an ABI 7900 Real Time thermocycler. Primer sequences used for qPCR are listed in supplemental Table 1. Expression levels were normalized using primers for β-actin. In separate experiments, phagocytosis was monitored using cells subjected to RNAi as described above. Phagocytosis of FITC-labeled E. coli particles was measured using the Vybrant phagocytosis assay kit (Molecular Probes) as described (34De Arras L. Yang I.V. Lackford B. Riches D.W. Prekeris R.

C. elegans survival assays were conducted largely as described previously (35Alper S. McElwee M.K. Apfeld J. Lackford B. Freedman J.H. Schwartz D.A.

Chem. 2010; 285: 1822-1828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In brief, animals in the late L4 stage were exposed to either pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14 (36Rahme L.G. Stevens E.J. Wolfort S.F. Shao J. Tompkins R.G. Ausubel F.M. Common virulence factors for bacterial pathogenicity in plants and animals.Science. 1995; 268: 1899-1902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or nonpathogenic E. coli strain OP50 at 25 °C on standard nematode growth medium (37Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar). The sole exception to this was the temperature-sensitive repo-1 mutant, which was allowed to develop at the permissive temperature (15 °C) and which was subsequently exposed to PA14 at the restrictive temperature of 26 °C at the young adult stage. Life span analysis using E. coli was performed in the presence of the sterilizing agent 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (38Mitchell D.H. Stiles J.W. Santelli J. Sanadi D.R. Synchronous growth and aging of Caenorhabditis elegans in the presence of fluorodeoxyuridine.J. Gerontol. 1979; 34: 28-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the survival assays in the presence of heat-killed E. coli, bacteria were incubated at 65 °C for 3 h, concentrated 10-fold, and plated on nematode growth medium plates (37Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar) supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Strains used were wild type N2, FX05176 klp-12(tm5176) IV, VC767 set-18(gk334) I, FX01968 siah-1(tm1968) IV, VC812 tag-260(ok1339) V, and repo-1(or430ts) IV. The repo-1 strain was outcrossed four times; the klp-12 and siah-1 strains were outcrossed twice. The set-18 and tag-260 strains were not reported to be outcrossed. The presence of all deletions was verified by PCR on genomic DNA. Deletion mutations have also been isolated in klp-7/Kif2a and ant-1.1/Slc25a5; both homozygous mutant strains were reported to be lethal or arrest during development and were therefore not tested in pathogen assays. Occupancy of the bacterial lawn and pharyngeal pumping rates of repo-1 mutant animals were monitored 18 h after shifting the young adults onto P. aeruginosa bacteria. For the Macf1 overexpression experiments, a plasmid containing the Macf1 cDNA cloned downstream of the CMV promoter (39Leung C.L. Sun D. Zheng M. Knowles D.R. Liem R.K. Microtubule actin cross-linking factor (MACF). A hybrid of dystonin and dystrophin that can interact with the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1275-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) was co-transfected with plasmids containing NFκB-AP1-luc (a 133-bp derivative of the IL-8 promoter driving firefly luciferase expression (40Mukaida N. Shiroo M. Matsushima K. Genomic structure of the human monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor IL-8.J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1366-1371PubMed Google Scholar)) and SV40-rluc (normalization control from Promega) into RAW264.7 cells using FuGENE-HD (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, cells were exposed to LPS for 6 h, and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized relative to Renilla luciferase activity. As a control, a plasmid driving expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) using the CMV promoter (pCDNA3.1/CAT, Invitrogen) was transfected in place of Macf1 in some experiments. Generation of the Macf1flox/flox mice has been described (41Goryunov D. He C.Z. Lin C.S. Leung C.L. Liem R.K. Nervous-tissue-specific elimination of microtubule-actin crosslinking factor 1a results in multiple developmental defects in the mouse brain.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2010; 44: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Macf1flox/flox mice were crossed with B6.129-LyzsTM1(cre)Ifo/J mice (JAX) (42Clausen B.E. Burkhardt C. Reith W. Renkawitz R. Förster I. Conditional gene targeting in macrophages and granulocytes using LysMcre mice.Transgenic Res. 1999; 8: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). The Lyzs promoter drives cre expression and thus deletion of Macf1 in the myeloid lineage in this strain. BMDM lacking Macf1 (Macf1flox/flox, Lyzscre/cre) were compared with control BMDM expressing Macf1 (Macf1+/+, Lyzscre/cre); both groups of mice were siblings derived from Macf1flox/+, Lyzscre/cre × Macf1flox/+, Lyzscre/cre matings. BMDM were generated as described (34De Arras L. Yang I.V. Lackford B. Riches D.W. Prekeris R. Freedman J.H. Schwartz D.A. Alper S. Spatiotemporal inhibition of innate immunity signaling by the Tbc1d23 RAB-GAP.J. Immunol. 2012; 188: 2905-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In brief, femur and tibia marrow was harvested, filtered, and plated in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen), penicillin and streptomycin (Fisher), and 20 ng/ml mouse M-CSF (R&D Systems). After 6 days, nonadherent stem cells were washed away, and adherent cells were collected by trypsinization for further experiments. Plating was performed similarly to the RNAi experiments described above. The extent of bone marrow stem cells differentiating into macrophages was similar between Macf1flox/flox mice and their wild type siblings (determined by F4/80 staining, wild type BMDM 76 ± 6% F4/80+, 21 ± 3 mean fluorescence intensity; Macf1flox/flox BMDM 83 ± 3% F4/80+, 21 ± 3 mean fluorescence intensity, n = 4, p = 0.98, both strains were homozygous for Lyzscre/cre). All data are from a minimum of three biological replicates. Statistical analyses for ELISAs and qPCRs were performed in GraphPad Prism 5 using unpaired t tests to determine significance (p < 0.05). Analysis of C. elegans survival data also was performed using Graphpad Prism 5. We previously presented siRNA data for Kif2a siRNA (12Alper S. Laws R. Lackford B. Boyd W.A. Dunlap P. Freedman J.H. Schwartz D.A. Identification of innate immunity genes and pathways using a comparative genomics approach.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7016-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); in this prior study, Kif2a siRNA's effect on the LPS response did not reach statistical significance, largely due to one outlier in the data (mean = 78% of control, n = 8, p = 0.197). The data in this study are statistically significant (mean 52%, n = 7, p = 0.003), and both data sets when considered together are also significant (mean 66%, n = 15, p = 0.0028). Using comparative genomics RNAi screens in C. elegans and mouse macrophages, we previously identified a protein interaction network that includes several proteins that modulate the innate immune response (supplemental Fig. 1) (12Alper S. Laws R. Lackford B. Boyd W.A. Dunlap P. Freedman J.H. Schwartz D.A. Identification of innate immunity genes and pathways using a comparative genomics approach.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7016-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). RNAi-mediated inhibition of several genes in this network either decreased expression of putative antimicrobial genes in C. elegans or production of LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines in murine macrophages or both (12Alper S. Laws R. Lackford B. Boyd W.A. Dunlap P. Freedman J.H. Schwartz D.A. Identification of innate immunity genes and pathways using a comparative genomics approach.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

It induces lysis of target eukaryotic cells by forming transmembrane oligomeric β-barrel channels. VCC also exhibits prominent lectin-like activity in interacting with β1-galactosyl-terminated glycoconjugates. Apart from the cytolysin domain, VCC harbors two lectin-like domains: the β-Trefoil and the β-Prism domains; however, precise contribution of these domains in the lectin property of VCC is not known. Also, role(s) of these lectin-like domains in the mode of action of VCC remain obscure. In the present study, we show that the β-Prism domain of VCC acts as the structural scaffold to determine the lectin activity of the protein toward β1-galactosyl-terminated glycoconjugates. Toward exploring the physiological implication of the β-Prism domain, we demonstrate that the presence of the β-Prism domain-mediated lectin activity is crucial for an efficient interaction of the toxin toward the target cells. Our results also suggest that such lectin activity may act to regulate the oligomerization ability of the membrane-bound VCC toxin. Based on the data presented here, and also consistent with the existing structural information, we propose a novel mechanism of regulation imposed by the β-Prism domain's lectin activity, implicated in the process of membrane pore formation by VCC.Background: Vibrio cholerae cytolysin is a pore-forming toxin with lectin-like activity.Results: β-Prism domain mediates the lectin activity, which determines efficient membrane binding and modulates membrane oligomerization of the toxin.Conclusion: β-Prism domain-mediated lectin activity acts to play critical regulatory role in the mode of action of the toxin.Significance: The study elucidates novel implications of the β-Prism domain-mediated lectin activity.

Apart from the cytolysin domain, mature VCC molecule possesses two additional C-terminal domains displaying the structural features of the lectin-like folds: a β-Trefoil lectin-like domain, followed by a β-Prism lectin-like domain (6De S. Olson R. Crystal structure of the Vibrio cholerae cytolysin heptamer reveals common features among disparate pore-forming toxins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The β-Trefoil domain is connected to the cytolysin domain through a short linker sequence, whereas the β-Prism domain is connected to the β-trefoil domain via a straight and long linker region (6De S. Olson R. Crystal structure of the Vibrio cholerae cytolysin heptamer reveals common features among disparate pore-forming toxins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Presence of the lectin-like domains is consistent with the previous report showing a lectin-like property of VCC, specifically toward the terminal β1-galactosyl moiety of complex glycoconjugates (21Saha N.

However, precise contribution of the β-Trefoil and the β-Prism domains toward the lectin-like property of VCC has not been explored yet. Moreover, implication of these lectin-like domains for the overall structure-function mechanism of VCC has not been elucidated. Here, we have studied the involvement of the β-Prism domain in the mode of action of the VCC toxin. In the first part of our study, we have investigated the role of the β-Prism domain in the context of the lectin-like activity of VCC. Using the β-Prism domain-deletion variant of the protein, we have shown that the presence of the β-Prism domain is critically required for the lectin activity of VCC toward β1-galactosyl-terminated complex glycoconjugates. Removal of the β-Prism domain results in complete loss of such lectin activity of the protein, while the isolated β-Prism domain alone exhibits prominent binding toward glycoconjugates possessing terminal β1-galactosyl groups. We have also mapped the critical residues within the β-Prism domain contributing toward the lectin activity of VCC. Toward exploring further the physiological implication of the lectin activity of the β-Prism domain, we have shown that the β-Prism domain-mediated lectin activity plays a critical role in targeting the VCC toxin toward the erythrocyte membrane. Specific disruption of the β-Prism domain lectin activity is found to have a deleterious effect on the membrane interacting propensity of the VCC protein. Finally, we have examined the role of the β-Prism domain-mediated lectin activity in regulating the membrane oligomerization process of VCC. Based on our result, we hypothesize that the β-Prism domain-mediated lectin activity may act as a crucial triggering mechanism so as to allow formation of the VCC oligomeric assembly in the target cell membrane. Altogether, our study provides novel insights regarding critical implications of the β-Prism domain-mediated lectin activity for the mode of action of VCC. All the recombinant constructs were generated by PCR-based strategy, and were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Purity of the protein samples were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Coomassie staining. Protein concentrations were measured by monitoring absorbance at 280 nm on the basis of theoretically calculated molar extinction coefficient values obtained from the analysis of the amino acid sequences of the protein constructs. Mature form of the recombinant VCC-Δβ-Prism variant was generated following the method as described for the wild type VCC (22Paul K. Chattopadhyay K. Unfolding distinguishes the Vibrio cholerae cytolysin precursor from the mature form of the toxin.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 3936-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant forms of the isolated β-Prism domain protein were generated using the method described for the wild type VCC protein, with some modification. Briefly, the nucleotide sequences encoding the wild type and mutant β-Prism domain constructs were cloned in the pET14b bacterial expression vector, proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli Origami B cells (Novagen), and recombinant His-tagged proteins were purified by Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) affinity chromatography followed by ion exchange chromatography in Q Sepharose (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Structural integrity of the β-Prism domain variants were assessed by monitoring the secondary structural organization of the proteins using far-UV CD spectroscopy (data not shown). D617A mutation was introduced in the nucleotide sequence encoding full-length VCC employing the PCR-based strategy. The construct was cloned into the pETite® N-His (Lucigen) bacterial expression vector as per the manufacturer's instructions, and the protein was overexpressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen). Mature form of the recombinant D617A-VCC protein was generated following the method as described for the wild type VCC (22Paul K. Chattopadhyay K. Unfolding distinguishes the Vibrio cholerae cytolysin precursor from the mature form of the toxin.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 3936-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra of the VCC variants (250–300 nm) were recorded on a Fluoromax-4 (Horiba Scientific, Edison, NJ) spectrofluorimeter, upon excitation at 290 nm using slit widths of 2.5 and 5 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Far-UV CD spectra of the VCC variants (0.5–1 μm) were monitored on a Chirascan spectropolarimeter (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, Surrey, UK) using 5 mm pathlength quartz cuvette as described before (22Paul K. Chattopadhyay K. Unfolding distinguishes the Vibrio cholerae cytolysin precursor from the mature form of the toxin.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 3936-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The cytolytic activity against human erythrocytes (suspended in PBS (20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.0) corresponding to OD650 nm = 0.8–0.9) was assayed by monitoring the decrease in turbidity of the erythrocyte suspension at 650 nm (21Saha N. Banerjee K.K. Carbohydrate-mediated regulation of interaction of Vibrio cholerae hemolysin with erythrocyte and phospholipid vesicle.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 162-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Binding of the VCC variants to the immobilized asialofetuin (Sigma Aldrich) were monitored following an ELISA-based method as described earlier (21Saha N. Banerjee K.K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 162-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of asialofetuin (10 μg/ml) in PBS was added into each well of 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates (Nunc), and incubated for overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TPBS), blocked with 200 μl of 3% nonfat dry milk powder in PBS for 1 h and subsequently treated with VCC variants for 2 h at 25 °C. After three washes with TPBS, wells were treated with 100 μl of rabbit anti-VCC antiserum [1:5000 dilution (v/v) for the wild type and β-Prism deleted variants of VCC; 1:50 (v/v) dilution for the wild type and mutant variants of β-Prism domain protein] for 90 min, washed three times with TPBS, and subsequently incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10000, v/v) for 1 h at 25 °C. Binding of VCC variants to asialofetuin were detected by color development by adding o-phenylenediamine (10 mg/ml) in 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.5) containing H2O2 (2 μl/ml of 30% (v/v) H2O2), reactions were stopped with 2 N H2SO4, and absorbance values were recorded at 490 nm in a microplate absorbance reader (iMark, Bio-Rad). Interactions of the β-Prism domain variants with asialofetuin were monitored by ITC-based experiments using an iTC200 instrument (MicroCal/GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). All the protein samples were taken in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and dialyzed extensively against the same buffer. Concentrations of the β-Prism variants were finally measured by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm as described above. Asialofetuin concentration was also determined by monitoring absorbance at 280 nm (based on the extinction coefficient of 0.45 for 1 mg/ml protein and a molecular mass of 48 kDa). All the buffers and protein reagents were freshly filtered and degassed under vacuum. For each ITC measurement, the sample cell (cell volume of 0.201 ml) was filled with the β-Prism variant protein (47.7 μm), and the reference cell was filled with the buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The β-Prism variant protein was titrated with asialofetuin (330 μm) using the following protocol: an initial 0.5 μl injection, followed by 19 injections of 2 μl each were applied with an interval of 3 min. The titration was carried out with a constant stirring at 1000 rpm at 25 °C. The binding isotherm profile was obtained excluding the initial data point. The data were fitted to one-site binding model using Origin 7 software. The values of ΔH (binding enthalpy in kcal/mol), Ka (association constant), and n (number of binding sites per monomer) were kept as adjustable parameters. The dissociation constant (Kd) was determined from 1/Ka. Experiments were carried out with the c values [= Ka.Mt(0); Mt(0) being the initial concentration of the macromolecule in the sample cell] in the range 1<c<500 (23Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Rapid measurement of binding constants and heats of binding using a new titration calorimeter.Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar). Binding of the full-length VCC and the VCC-Δβ-Prism variant to human erythrocytes were quantitatively estimated using a flow cytometry-based assay following the methods as described in (24Paul K. Chattopadhyay K. Single point mutation in Vibrio cholerae cytolysin compromises membrane pore-formation mechanism of the toxin.Febs J. 2012; 279: 4039-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, human erythrocytes were incubated with VCC variants for 30 min at 4 °C in PBS. Cells were then treated with rabbit anti-VCC antiserum, followed by treatment with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody as described previously (24Paul K. Chattopadhyay K. Single point mutation in Vibrio cholerae cytolysin compromises membrane pore-formation mechanism of the toxin.Febs J. 2012; 279: 4039-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were analyzed by FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer. FITC fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm, with an emission wavelength of 530 nm. The geometric mean fluorescence (GMF) values were obtained using the FlowJo software (www.flowjo.com). The % binding data were calculated using the expression: [(GMFtest − GMFcontrol)/(GMFmaximum − GMFcontrol)] ×100. GMFcontrol represents GMF for the cells that were not treated with VCC variants, but stained with anti-VCC and anti-rabbit-FITC; GMFmaximum represents GMF for the cells incubated with the highest concentration of full-length VCC (75 nm), followed by treatment with anti-VCC and anti-rabbit-FITC. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting was done following standard protocol using rabbit anti-VCC antiserum. The blot was developed using the ECL Western blotting detection kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), and images were acquired using ImageQuant LAS 4010 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Cholesterol and Asolectin (from soybean) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Asolectin-cholesterol (with weight ratio of 1:1) mixed liposome was prepared following the methods described earlier (25Chattopadhyay K. Banerjee K.K.

Briefly, the lipids dissolved in chloroform were evaporated under vacuum, resuspended in PBS. Large unilamellar vesicles were generated by repeatedly passing the liposome suspension through polycarbonate membranes of 0.1 μm pore size using a Mini-Extruder apparatus (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.). VCC structural coordinates were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (PDB entry 1XEZ for water-soluble monomeric form of VCC; PDB entry 3O44 for the VCC oligomer). Superimposition of structural coordinates were performed using the program COOT (27Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallographica. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17079) Google Scholar). The structural models were visualized using PyMOL [DeLano, W. L. (2002) The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, found online (www.pymol.org)]. Analysis of the VCC molecular structure reveals that the C-terminal region of the toxin encompassing the residues Gln-584 to Asn-716 constitutes a β-Prism lectin-like domain (6De S. Olson R.

In our study, we generated the truncation variant of VCC lacking the β-Prism domain (VCC-Δβ-Prism; having deletion in the region Gln-584 to Asn-716 of wild type VCC molecule) (Fig. 1, B and C). Consistent with the earlier reports (7Olson R. Gouaux E. Crystal structure of the Vibrio cholerae cytolysin (VCC) pro-toxin and its assembly into a heptameric transmembrane pore.J. Mol.

Res. 2011; 133: 131-137PubMed Google Scholar), the VCC-Δβ-Prism variant was found to have severely compromised cytolytic activity. The VCC-Δβ-Prism protein, at the concentration range of 100 nm, displayed <10% of the wild type hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (Fig. 1D). Previous studies have reported noticeable hemolytic activity, although significantly reduced as compared with the full-length VCC, for the β-Prism domain-deleted variant of VCC (7Olson R. Gouaux E. Crystal structure of the Vibrio cholerae cytolysin (VCC) pro-toxin and its assembly into a heptameric transmembrane pore.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 997-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 28Mazumdar B. Ganguly S. Ghosh A.N. Banerjee K.K. The role of C-terminus carbohydrate-binding domain of Vibrio cholerae haemolysin/cytolysin in the conversion of the pre-pore β-barrel oligomer to a functional diffusion channel.Indian J. Med. Res. 2011; 133: 131-137PubMed Google Scholar). Such studies have used rabbit erythrocytes for monitoring hemolytic activity, and rabbit erythrocytes are known to display significantly enhanced susceptibility toward VCC-induced hemolysis (29Zitzer A. Palmer M. Weller U. Wassenaar T. Biermann C. Tranum-Jensen J. Bhakdi S. Mode of primary binding to target membranes and pore formation induced by Vibrio cholerae cytolysin (hemolysin).Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed differences in the hemolytic activity of the VCC-Δβ-Prism proteins, as reported in the present study and in the earlier reports, could be attributed to the differential susceptibility of the human and rabbit erythrocytes toward VCC-mediated cytotoxicity. When compared with those of the full-length VCC protein, the VCC-Δβ-Prism variant displayed overall similar intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra (full-length VCC contains 11 tryptophan residues distributed throughout the protein structure; two of these are located within the β-Prism domain) and far-UV circular dichroism (CD) profile (Fig. 1E). Moreover, when subjected to thermal denaturation, VCC-Δβ-Prism displayed unfolding propensity similar to that of the full-length VCC protein, as monitored by the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements (data not shown). Altogether, these data suggested that the removal of the β-Prism domain did not affect the folding and the structural integrity of the truncated VCC variant. It is also important to note here that the VCC-Δβ-Prism protein, despite having critically compromised hemolytic activity, could form SDS-stable oligomeric assembly in the membrane lipid bilayer of human erythrocytes, a characteristic feature of the archetypical β-PFTs including VCC (Fig. 1D, inset) (24Paul K. Chattopadhyay K. Single point mutation in Vibrio cholerae cytolysin compromises membrane pore-formation mechanism of the toxin.Febs J. 2012; 279: 4039-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). VCC has been reported to possess potent lectin-like property with specificity toward β1-galactosyl-terminated complex glycoconjugates (21Saha N. Banerjee K.K. Carbohydrate-mediated regulation of interaction of Vibrio cholerae hemolysin with erythrocyte and phospholipid vesicle.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 162-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, it is still not known which of the two lectin-like domains, namely the β-Trefoil and the β-Prism domains, of VCC contribute toward this lectin-like property. To explore the potential contribution of the β-Prism domain in the lectin-like activity of VCC, we employed an ELISA-based assay to test and compare the ability of the VCC-Δβ-Prism variant to bind to the immobilized β1-galactosyl-terminated glycoprotein asialofetuin. It has been shown previously that VCC binds specifically to the terminal β1-galactosyl moiety of asialofetuin (21Saha N. Banerjee K.K. Carbohydrate-mediated regulation of interaction of Vibrio cholerae hemolysin with erythrocyte and phospholipid vesicle.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 162-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Consistent with the earlier report (21Saha N. Banerjee K.K.

In contrast, the VCC-Δβ-Prism variant displayed no detectable binding to the immobilized asialofetuin (Fig. 2A). The result, therefore, suggested that the β-Prism domain of VCC acted as the structural scaffold supporting the lectin activity of the VCC toxin. This also ruled out the contribution of"
https://openalex.org/W2097049492,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is predominantly characterized by chromosomal translocations between the retinoic acid receptor, alpha (RARA) gene and the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) or promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) gene. In APL cells with PML/RARA fusions, arsenic trioxide and all-trans retinoic acid treatments specifically target the fusion protein for proteasome-dependent degradation, thereby promoting cellular differentiation and clinical remission of disease. In contrast, APL cells expressing PLZF/RARA fusion proteins are largely resistant to similar treatments and prognosis for patients with this translocation is poor. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating PLZF/RARA protein stability would provide novel therapeutic targets for PLZF/RARA-associated APL. Toward this end, we have performed an RNAi-based screen to identify factors affecting PLZF/RARA stability. Among the factors identified was the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 37 (USP37). We showed that USP37 interacted with PLZF/RARA through the PLZF moiety and sustained PLZF/RARA steady state levels. Domain mapping study revealed that N-terminal domain of USP37 is required for the PLZF/RARA interaction and protein regulation. Furthermore, overexpression or depletion of USP37 caused an increase or decrease of PLZF/RARA protein half-life, correlating with down- or upregulation of PLZF/RARA poly-ubiquitination, respectively. By PLZF/RARA-transduced primary mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells, we demonstrated that Usp37 knockdown alleviated PLZF/RARA-mediated target gene suppression and cell transformation potential. Altogether, our findings of USP37-modulating PLZF/RARA stability and cell transformation suggest that USP37 is a potential therapeutic target for PLZF/RARA-associated APL."
https://openalex.org/W1978413110,"Involvement of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in carcinogenesis has been suggested in many studies. Upregulation of AHR has been reported in some cancer species, and an association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of AHR and cancer risk or cancer development has also been reported. This evidence suggests the involvement of some specific SNPs in AHR transcriptional regulation in the process of carcinogenesis or cancer development, but there have been no studies to elucidate the mechanism involved. In this study, we identified the transcription factor Nuclear Factor 1-C (NF1C) as a candidate to regulate AHR transcription in a polymorphism-dependent manner. SNP rs10249788 was included in a consensus binding site for NF1C. Our results suggested that NF1C preferred the C allele to the T allele at rs10249788 for binding. Forced expression of NF1C suppressed the activity of the AHR promoter with C at rs10249788 stronger than that with T. Moreover, expression analysis of human uterine endometrial cancer (HEC) specimens showed greater upregulation of AHR and downregulation of NF1C than those of normal endometrium specimens. Sequence analysis showed HEC patients at advanced stages tended to possess T/T alleles more frequently than healthy women. We also demonstrated that NF1C suppressed proliferation, motility and invasion of HEC cells. This function was at least partially mediated by AHR. This study is the first to report that a polymorphism on the AHR regulatory region affected transcriptional regulation of the AHR gene in vitro. Because NF1C is a tumor suppressor, our new insights into AHR deregulation and its polymorphisms could reveal novel mechanisms of genetic susceptibility to cancer."

IL-12Rβ2 is not expressed in naïve T cells but is complementarily induced by TCR activation and T-BET and maintained by IFNγ (12Szabo S.J. Dighe A.S. Gubler U. Murphy K.M.

The Th1 cell differentiation is thus regulated by an interrelated signaling network with multiple factors positively regulating each other. The proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) family of serine/threonine-specific kinases consists of three members, PIM1, PIM2, and PIM3. These kinases are evolutionarily highly conserved and have largely overlapping functions but differ in their tissue distribution (18Eichmann A. Yuan L. Bréant C. Alitalo K. Koskinen P.J.

PIM1 and PIM2 have been reported to be predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells where their expression is regulated by several cytokines and growth factors (19Mikkers H. Nawijn M. Allen J. Brouwers C. Verhoeven E. Jonkers J. Berns A. Mice deficient for all PIM kinases display reduced body size and impaired responses to hematopoietic growth factors.Mol. Cell.

Hammerman P.S. Thompson C.B. The Pim kinases control rapamycin-resistant T cell survival and activation.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The substrates and binding partners identified for PIM kinases include Bcl2-associated death promoter (BAD) protein, a proapoptotic protein; p100, an activator of c-Myb transcription factor; and NFATc1, a mediator of TCR signaling as well as several factors involved in cell cycle regulation (20Bachmann M. Möröy T. The serine/threonine kinase Pim-1.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). PIM1 has also been shown to activate c-MYC target genes by chromatin phosphorylation (26Zippo A. De Robertis A. Serafini R. Oliviero S. PIM1-dependent phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 is required for MYC-dependent transcriptional activation and oncogenic transformation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 932-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In addition, PIM kinases have been implicated in the inhibition of STAT5 and STAT6 signaling through the regulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins SOCS1 and SOCS3 (27Peltola K.J. Paukku K. Aho T.L. Ruuska M. Silvennoinen O. Koskinen P.J.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2175-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the expression of PIM family genes is up-regulated by Th1-polarizing cytokines (29Aho T.L. Lund R.J. Ylikoski E.K. Matikainen S. Lahesmaa R. Koskinen P.J. Expression of human pim family genes is selectively up-regulated by cytokines promoting T helper type 1, but not T helper type 2, cell differentiation.Immunology. 2005; 116: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for PIM kinases in the regulation of Th1 cell differentiation. In this study, we have investigated the functional role of PIM family kinases in the regulation of human Th1 cell differentiation. We demonstrate that the PIM kinases promote the Th1 cell differentiation by inducing several factors critical for the Th1 polarization. Our RNA interference results depict that the PIM kinases are important for the up-regulation of two Th1-driving pathways, IFNγ/T-BET and IL-12/STAT4 pathways. Human mononuclear cells were isolated from the cord blood of healthy neonates using Ficoll-Paque isolation (Amersham Biosciences). CD4+ cells were further purified using DYNAL magnetic beads (Invitrogen). Cells from several individuals were pooled after the isolation. Cell cultures were made in Yssel's medium (Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with Yssel's medium concentrate, penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% AB serum). Cells were activated with plate-bound α-CD3 (0.5 μg/well) and soluble α-CD28 (0.5 μg/ml; both from Immunotech, Marseille, France) and at the same time polarized toward Th1 cells with 2.5 ng/ml IL-12 or toward Th2 cells with 10 ng/ml IL-4 (both from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). IL-2 (40 units/ml; R&D Systems) was added into the cultures after 48 h of priming. For PIM knockdown experiments, freshly isolated CD4+ cells were suspended in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) and transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides (Sigma-Aldrich) (see Table 1) using the nucleofection technique (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany). 4 × 106 cells were transfected with a total of 4.5 μg of siRNA (4.5 μg of non-targeting (NT) siRNA or 1.5 μg each of PIM1/2/3 siRNA). The nucleofected cells were allowed to rest for 20 h in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10% FCS at 37 °C (2 × 106 cells/ml) and subsequently activated and cultured in Yssel's medium as described above. For STAT4 and STAT6 knockdown experiments, 1.5 μg of NT siRNA, STAT6 siRNA, or STAT4 siRNA (pool of two siRNAs; 1:1) was used. Nucleofections and culturing were performed similarly as in the PIM knockdown experiments except that the cells were rested for 24 h after nucleofection.

A fraction of the CXCR3− CD4+ cell population was collected as control. Anti-mouse IgG1 κ-allophycocyanin and anti-mouse IgG1 κ-phycoerythrin (both from BD Pharmingen) were used as isotype controls. Sorted cell populations were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28 and cultured in Yssel's medium (as described above). After 24 and 48 h of culturing, samples for Western blotting were collected. The intracellular IFNγ production of the CXCR3-positive and -negative populations was analyzed after 40 h of activation by intracellular cytokine staining as described below. Total RNA samples were isolated and prepared for RT-PCR analysis as described previously (30Lund R.J. Ylikoski E.K. Aittokallio T. Nevalainen O. Lahesmaa R.

The primers and probes used (Oligomer, Helsinki, Finland; see Table 1) were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). Universal Probe Library assays (Roche Applied Science) were designed using ProbeFinderTM software. The mRNA levels were normalized against the levels of a housekeeping gene, elongation factor 1α (EF1α) (31Hamalainen H.K. Tubman J.C. Vikman S. Kyrölä T. Ylikoski E. Warrington J.A. Lahesmaa R.

Cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton-X-100, 5% glycerol, 1% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF), boiled for 5 min, and sonicated, and equal amounts of protein were subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins were detected using the following antibodies: mouse α-PIM1 (12H8, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit α-PIM2 (ATLAS Antibodies, Stockholm, Sweden or D1D2, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), rabbit α-PIM3 (D17C9, Cell Signaling Technology), mouse α-T-BET (4B10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit α-STAT1 p84/p91 (E-23, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit α-STAT4 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse α-STAT6 (BD Biosciences), mouse α-GAPDH (number 5G4, 6C5, HyTest, Turku, Finland), and mouse α-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat α-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or α-rabbit IgG (BD Biosciences) were used as secondary antibodies. The proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare), quantified with a microcomputer imaging device (M5+, Imaging Research Inc., St. Catharines, Canada), and normalized against β-actin. For quantification, suitable non-overexposed film was used for each protein studied. To measure IFNγ production from Th1-polarized cells, duplicate samples were stained on 96-well plates (Milliplex Map kit, Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and measured using the Luminex® 100TM system (Luminex, Austin, TX). The cytokine concentrations of cell culture supernatants were normalized against relative cell counts obtained by flow cytometry. To measure the expression of IL-12Rβ2 on the surface of Th1-polarized cells, cells were first incubated with rat α-human IL-12Rβ2 (CD212) antibody or rat IgG2a (isotype control; both from BD Pharmingen) and then with biotin-conjugated α-rat antibody (BD Pharmingen) and finally labeled with streptavidin-peridinin-chlorophyll protein complex (BD Pharmingen). Samples were measured with the FACSCaliburTM system and analyzed with CellQuest Pro (both from BD Biosciences). The flow cytometric analysis of intracellular cytokine staining of nucleofected Th1-polarized cells was performed as described previously (32Tahvanainen J. Pykäläinen M. Kallonen T. Lähteenmäki H.

In short, the NT and PIM1 + PIM2 + PIM3 (PIM123) siRNA-nucleofected cells were activated and cultured under Th1-polarizing conditions for 6 days after which the cells were harvested and washed with PBS. Half of the cells were restimulated with 5 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Calbiochem) and 0.5 pg/ml ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) in Yssel's medium, and the other half was incubated in Yssel's medium and used as an unstimulated control. After 2 h of incubation, 10 μg/ml brefeldin A (Alexis Biochemicals, Lausanne, Switzerland) was added, and incubation was continued for another 3 h. Cells were washed twice with 0.5% BSA, PBS (w/v), 0.01% NaN3; fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS; and permeabilized with 0.5% saponin, PBS. Anti-human IFNγ-FITC (Invitrogen) was used for staining of the intracellular IFNγ and anti-mouse IgG1-FITC (Invitrogen) was used as an isotype control. Cells were analyzed with the FACSCalibur system and analyzed with CellQuest Pro (both from BD Biosciences). Nucleofected cells were harvested at 6 h after culturing them under Th1- or Th2-polarizing conditions from three independent biological replicate cultures. The subsequent sample treatments were performed at the Finnish Microarray and Sequencing Centre, Turku, Finland. Total RNA was isolated with an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and sample preparation for GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) oligonucleotide array hybridizations was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using 250 ng of total RNA as starting material with a GeneChip 3′ IVT Express kit (Affymetrix). Samples were hybridized to HG-U219 arrays using a GeneTitan® instrument (both from Affymetrix). Microarray data were normalized using a robust multiarray average algorithm (33Irizarry R.A. Hobbs B. Collin F. Beazer-Barclay Y.D. Antonellis K.J. Scherf U. Speed T.P. Exploration, normalization, and summaries of high density oligonucleotide array probe level data.Biostatistics. 2003; 4: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (8454) Google Scholar). Duplicate and unannotated probe sets were removed using the genefilter package in R. 4R. Gentleman, V. Carey, W. Huber, and F. Hahne, genefilter: methods for filtering genes from microarray experiments, R package version 1.38.0 online manual. In the case of duplicates, the probe set with the highest interquartile range was retained. Present and absent calls for probe sets were generated by fitting the chip-wide expression data to a two-component Gaussian distribution function using the standard expectation-maximization algorithm implemented in the mixtools package in R (35Benaglia T. Chaveau D. Hunter D.R. Young D.S. Mixtools: an R package for analyzing mixture models.J. Stat. Software. 2009; 32: 1-29Crossref Scopus (819) Google Scholar). A probe set was defined to be present if it has an expression value higher than the threshold where the two components of the Gaussian distribution densities meet (36Lee H.J. Suk J.E. Patrick C.

Linear models and empirical Bayes methods for assessing differential expression in microarray experiments.Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol.

The genes were considered as differentially expressed when the Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted false discovery rate was <0.1 and log -fold change was <−0.5 or >0.5. Overrepresentation analysis of transcription factor binding sites was done using GeneTrail (39Backes C. Keller A. Kuentzer J. Kneissl B. Comtesse N. Elnakady Y.A. Müller R. Meese E. Lenhof H.P.

To analyze the expression levels of PIM family kinases during human T helper cell differentiation, naïve Th precursor (Thp) cells were activated and either cultured in neutral conditions without polarizing cytokines (Th0) or differentiated in the Th1 or Th2 direction.

Here, we used primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the EA.hy926 cell line to study the molecular events that occur after dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) infection. DENV2-induced apoptosis was confirmed using nuclear staining, TUNEL assay, and electron microscopy. A genome-wide transcriptome analysis was performed using a microarray of DENV2-infected HUVECs. Notably, interferon-inducible genes were differentially expressed after DENV2 infection. Prominent among these genes was the X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP)-associated factor 1 (XAF1; up-regulated 1.2-fold in the microarray analysis and ~8-fold by qRT-PCR after DENV2 infection). XAF1 protein levels were up-regulated after DENV2 infection in both HUVECs and EA.hy926 cells. Evidence indicated interaction between XAF1 and XIAP during DENV2 infection based on their cellular localization, as observed by confocal microscopy and the coimmunoprecipitation of XIAP with an anti-XAF1 antibody. Next, recombinant EA.hy926 cell lines in which XAF1 was either knocked down or overexpressed were constructed. The expression levels of the apoptosis-related genes caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9, and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were down-regulated in the XAF1 knockdown (24–48 h postinfection) but were up-regulated in XAF1 overexpressing cells (36 h postinfection). This is the first study of the role of XAF1 in promoting apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells after DENV2 infection.—Long, X., Li, Y., Qi, Y., Xu, J., Wang, Z., Zhang, X., Zhang, D., Zhang, L., Huang, J.

https://openalex.org/W1999344846,"Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) is a group of inherited disorders characterized clinically by exclusively or predominantly peripheral nerve dysfunction. CMT1X, the most common form of X-linked CMT is caused by mutations in connexin 32 (Cx32). In this work, we used dual whole cell patch clamp recording to examine the functional effects of mutations at the Arg(75) position. This residue is highly conserved among members of the connexin family, and disease-causing mutations have been identified at this (or the corresponding) position in Cx26, Cx43, and Cx46. Thus, a better understanding of the effects of mutations of this position in Cx32 may have relevance to pathogenesis of a number of different human diseases. All three mutants associated with CMT1X (R75P, R75Q, and R75W) showed very low levels of coupling similar to those of the cells transfected with vector alone. Heterotypic pairing with Cx32 WT showed that the absence of coupling for these mutants in the homotypic configuration could be explained by shifts in their hemichannel G(j)-V(j) relations. Examination of the expression levels and gating characteristics of seven additional mutants (R75A, R75D, R75E, R75H, R75K, R75L, and R75V) at this position suggest that the positive charge at position 75 in Cx32 is required for normal channel function but not for gap junction assembly. Our studies also suggest that disease treatment strategies for CMT1X, which correct trafficking abnormalities in Cx32, may be ineffective for the group of mutations also conferring changes in gating properties of Cx32 channels."
https://openalex.org/W2020119521,"A single human cell contains more than 5.0 × 105 copies of long interspersed element-1 (L1), 80–100 of which are competent for retrotransposition (L1-RTP). Recent observations have revealed the presence of de novo L1 insertions in various tumors, but little is known about its mechanism. Here, we found that 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-3,8-dimethyl-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), food-borne carcinogens that are present in broiled meats, induced L1-RTP. This induction was dependent on a cellular cascade comprising the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a mitogen-activated protein kinase, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β. Notably, these compounds exhibited differential induction of L1-RTP. MeIQx-induced L1-RTP was dependent on AhR nuclear translocator 1 (ARNT1), a counterpart of AhR required for gene expression in response to environmental pollutants. By contrast, PhIP-induced L1-RTP did not require ARNT1 but was dependent on estrogen receptor α (ERα) and AhR repressor. In vivo studies using transgenic mice harboring the human L1 gene indicated that PhIP-induced L1-RTP was reproducibly detected in the mammary gland, which is a target organ of PhIP-induced carcinoma. Moreover, picomolar levels of each compound induced L1-RTP, which is comparable to the PhIP concentration detected in human breast milk. Data suggest that somatic cells possess machineries that induce L1-RTP in response to the carcinogenic compounds. Together with data showing that micromolar levels of heterocyclic amines (HCAs) were non-genotoxic, our observations indicate that L1-RTP by environmental compounds is a novel type of genomic instability, further suggesting that analysis of L1-RTP by HCAs is a novel approach to clarification of modes of carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1990597933,"The ability of cells to invade into the dermis is a critical event in the development of cutaneous melanoma and ultimately an indicator of poor prognosis. However, the molecular events surrounding the acquisition of this invasive phenotype remain incompletely understood. Mutations in B-RAF are frequent in melanoma and are known to regulate the invasive phenotype. In this study, we sought to determine the molecular mechanisms controlling melanoma invasion. We found that mutant B-RAF signaling regulates a cadherin switch. In melanoma cells expressing mutant B-RAF we observed high levels of N-cadherin and low levels of E-cadherin. Depletion of mutant B-RAF, by small interfering RNA, caused a decrease in the levels of N-cadherin and an increase in the levels of E-cadherin. Mechanistically, we found that this cadherin switch required the activity of Rac1 and its GEF, Tiam1, both of which show suppressed activity in the presence of mutant B-RAF. Consistent with the work of others, we found that depletion of mutant B-RAF decreased the invasive capacity of the melanoma cells. However, simultaneous depletion of B-RAF and Rac or Tiam1 resulted in invasive capacity similar to that of control cells. Taken together, our results suggest that mutant B-RAF signaling downregulates Tiam1/Rac activity resulting in an increase in N-cadherin levels and a decrease in E-cadherin levels and ultimately enhanced invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2094369420,"Misfolding of the natively α-helical prion protein into a β-sheet rich isoform is related to various human diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome. In humans, the disease phenotype is modified by a methionine/valine polymorphism at codon 129 of the prion protein gene.

https://openalex.org/W2048385131,"Somatic mutations accumulate in senescent cells. Bcl6, which functions as a transcriptional repressor, has been identified as a potent inhibitor of cell senescence, but a role of Bcl6 in the accumulation of somatic mutations has remained unclear. Ig class-switch recombination simultaneously induces somatic mutations in an IgM class-switch (Ig-Sμ) region of IgG B cells. Surprisingly, mutations were detected in the Ig-Sμ region of Bcl6-deficient IgM B cells without class-switch recombination, and these mutations were mainly generated by conversion of adenosine to guanosine, suggesting a novel DNA mutator in the B cells. The ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1) gene was overexpressed in Bcl6-deficient cells, and its promoter analysis revealed that ADAR1 is a molecular target of Bcl6. Exogenous ADAR1 induced adenosine-targeted DNA mutations in IgM B cells from ADAR1-transgenic mice and in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). These mutations accumulated in senescent MEFs accompanied with endogenous ADAR1 expression, and the frequency in senescent Bcl6-deficient MEFs was higher than senescent wild-type MEFs. Thus, Bcl6 protects senescent cells from accumulation of adenosine-targeted DNA mutations induced by ADAR1."
https://openalex.org/W2090879221,"PEP-19 is a small, intrinsically disordered protein that binds to the C-domain of calmodulin (CaM) via an IQ motif and tunes its Ca2+ binding properties via an acidic sequence. We show here that the acidic sequence of PEP-19 has intrinsic Ca2+ binding activity, which may modulate Ca2+ binding to CaM by stabilizing an initial Ca2+-CaM complex or by electrostatically steering Ca2+ to and from CaM. Because PEP-19 is expressed in cells that exhibit highly active Ca2+ dynamics, we tested the hypothesis that it influences ligand-dependent Ca2+ release.

Mutations in the acidic sequence of PEP-19 that inhibit or prevent it from modulating Ca2+ binding to CaM greatly inhibit its effect on ATP-induced Ca2+ release.

PEP-19 (Purkinje cell protein 4, Pcp4) is a small protein (62 amino acids) with no known intrinsic activity other than binding to CaM 2The abbreviations used are: CaMcalmodulinC-CaMisolated C domain of CaMNgneurograninBAPTA1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acidIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateCaM(DA)donor- and acceptor-labeled CaM. in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Although it was originally identified in the central nervous system, PEP-19 mRNA is also found in human bladder, kidney, prostate, uterus, thyroid, and adrenal tissues (1Ge X. Yamamoto S. Tsutsumi S.

Changes in expression levels suggest biological roles for PEP-19 in both normal and pathological conditions. For example, PEP-19 mRNA levels are significantly reduced in a mouse model for Parkinson disease (2Sköld K. Svensson M. Nilsson A. Zhang X. Nydahl K. Caprioli R.M. Svenningsson P. Andrén P.E.

Animal and cellular model systems have demonstrated effects of PEP-19 on diverse cellular processes. PEP-19 null mice show a dramatic reduction in long term plasticity at synapses between granule cell parallel fibers and Purkinje cells (6Wei P. Blundon J.A. Rong Y. Zakharenko S.S. Morgan J.I.

Overexpression of PEP-19 in PC12 cells increases neurite outgrowth (7Harashima S. Wang Y. Horiuchi T. Seino Y. Inagaki N.

Res. 2011; 89: 1519-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and premature neuronal differentiation is seen in transgenic mice with three copies of the PEP-19 gene (Pcp4) (8Mouton-Liger F.

In addition, PEP-19 has anti-apoptotic activity when expressed in PC12 and HEK293T cells (9Erhardt J.A. Legos J.J. Johanson R.A. Slemmon J.R. Wang X.

These experimental observations are consistent with a proposed neuroprotective role for PEP-19 based on expression patterns in neuronal tissues that are susceptible to Huntington and Alzheimer diseases (11Utal A.K. Stopka A.L. Roy M. Coleman P.D. PEP-19 immunohistochemistry defines the basal ganglia and associated structures in the adult human brain and is dramatically reduced in Huntington's disease.Neuroscience. 1998; 86: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The above studies emphasize the need to understand the mechanism of action of PEP-19. Two models for PEP-19 have been proposed based on studies using peptides and the homologous proteins neurogranin (Ng) and neuromodulin (12Slemmon J.R. Morgan J.I. Fullerton S.M. Danho W. Hilbush B.S. Wengenack T.M. Camstatins are peptide antagonists of calmodulin based upon a conserved structural motif in PEP-19, neurogranin, and neuromodulin.J. Biol.

Sutcliffe J.G. RC3/neurogranin, a postsynaptic calpacitin for setting the response threshold to calcium influxes.Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 15: 131-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The first, or camstatin model, proposes that PEP-19 competitively inhibits activation of CaM target proteins. The second, or calpacitin model, proposes that PEP-19 binds with high affinity to apo-CaM to retard its release from PEP-19, thereby affecting the temporal profile of available CaM during a Ca2+ pulse. We proposed an alternative or additional mechanism for PEP-19 based on its ability to modulate the Ca2+ binding properties of CaM. Specifically, PEP-19 increases both the Ca2+ kon and koff rates at the C-domain of CaM up to 40-fold with little effect on the KCa (15Putkey J.A. Kleerekoper Q. Gaertner T.R. Waxham M.N. A new role for IQ motif proteins in regulating calmodulin function.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49667-49670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We also showed that an acidic sequence located adjacent to the IQ motif is required to modulate Ca2+ binding to the C-domain of CaM, even though it has no apparent intrinsic affinity for CaM (16Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. Gaertner T.R. Brewer K.J. Goldsmith M. Kubota Y. Kleerekoper Q.K. Acidic/IQ motif regulator of calmodulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1401-1410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, the acidic/IQ motif of PEP-19 has the potential to modulate the rate-limiting kinetics of Ca2+ binding to CaM. This study investigates the molecular mechanism by which PEP-19 modulates Ca2+ binding to CaM, and it tests the hypothesis that the biological activities of PEP-19 rely on synergy between the biochemical properties of its acidic and IQ sequences. Our results show that the acidic sequence in PEP-19 has intrinsic metal binding properties that play a role in increasing the rates of Ca2+ binding to CaM, at least in part, by electrostatically steering Ca2+ to and from Ca2+ binding sites III and/or IV. We also show that PEP-19 sensitizes HeLa cells to ATP-dependent Ca2+ release and that this effect is greatly reduced or eliminated by mutations in PEP-19 that inhibit or eliminate its ability to modulate Ca2+ binding to CaM. Tuning the activities of Ca2+ mobilization pathways by PEP-19 greatly expands the biological significance of this small regulator of CaM signaling. QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate a panel of PEP-19 mutants. CaM and C-CaM (isolated C domain of calmodulin) were decalcified by addition of 5 mm EDTA and 0.1 mm BAPTA as a UV marker and then desalting on a Bio-Gel P2 column (Bio-Rad) in 10 mm NH4HCO3 that had been decalcified using a Ca2+ sponge column (Molecular Probes). Decalcified proteins were then lyophilized and resuspended in desired buffers. Protein concentrations were estimated using an extinction coefficient of ϵ276 nm = 0.18 ml−1 mg−1 for C-CaM and ϵ215 nm = 0.59 ml−1 mg−1 for PEP-19. The rate of Ca2+ dissociation (koff) from CaM or C-CaM in the presence or absence of PEP-19 derivatives was determined using stopped-flow fluorescence and the Ca2+-sensitive dye Quin-2 as described previously (15Putkey J.A. Kleerekoper Q. Gaertner T.R. Waxham M.N. A new role for IQ motif proteins in regulating calmodulin function.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49667-49670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Typically, solutions of 2–5 μm CaM or C-CaM in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 30 μm CaCl2 were rapidly mixed with 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 300 μm Quin-2. Excess free Ca2+ and Ca2+ that is rapidly released from the N-domain of CaM bind to Quin-2 in the 1.7-ms dead time of the stopped-flow instrument. The subsequent increase in Quin-2 fluorescence is due to binding Ca2+ released slowly from the C-domain. Experiments were performed at 23 °C using an Applied Photophysics Ltd. (Leatherhead, UK) model SX20 MV sequential stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter with a 150 watt Xe/Hg lamp. Equilibrium Ca2+ binding constants for CaM in the presence or absence of PEP-19 derivatives were determined using tyrosine fluorescence at 23 °C as described previously (17Xiong L.W. Kleerekoper Q.K. Wang X. Putkey J.A. Intra- and interdomain effects due to mutation of calcium-binding sites in calmodulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 8094-8103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Data were collected with a QuantaMaster fluorimeter (Photo Technology International). Intrinsic Tyr emission spectra were recorded from 290 to 320 nm with the excitation wavelength of 276 nm. Solutions contained 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 0 or 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm HEDTA, 1 mm nitrilo-2,2′,2′-triacetic acid, 5 μm CaM or C-CaM with or without PEP-19 or its derivatives. Calcium was added from a concentrated stock prepared in the same buffer with CaM, PEP-19, and chelators, so that only the concentration of Ca2+ changes during the titration even though the volume increases. The concentration of total Ca2+ needed to achieve a desired free Ca2+ concentration was determined using the on-line calculator MaxChelator. Control titrations were performed using Br2BAPTA as an indicator instead of CaM or C-CaM to confirm that the calculated free Ca2+ was accurate at high and low ionic strength. The KCa for Br2BAPTA is 1.59 μm at 100 mm KCl and 0.15 μm at 10 mm KCl (18Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsén S. Calcium binding to calmodulin and its globular domains.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine fluorescence intensity was plotted against the free Ca2+ concentration and fit to the following form of the Hill Equation 1, F=Fmin+(Fmax−Fmin)[[Ca]n[Ca]n+[kCa]n](Eq. 1) where [Ca2+] is the free Ca2+ concentration; F is the fluorescence intensity at a given free Ca2+ concentration; Fmin is the initial fluorescence intensity in the absence of added Ca2+; Fmax is the fluorescence at maximal Ca2+; KCa is the concentration of Ca2+ at which the change in fluorescence is half-maximal, and n is the Hill coefficient. NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DRX 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance cryoprobe at 298 K. Protein samples were dissolved in buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, 5% D2O (v/v), pH 6.3, 100 mm KCl. 1H,15N HSQC spectra were used to determine residues in PEP-19 that are affected by binding to C-CaM. Briefly, 1H,15N HSQC spectra were collected during titration of 15N-labeled PEP-19 with C-CaM in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Characteristics of fast exchange were seen at saturating Ca2+, so backbone amides could be assigned by following cross-peaks during the titration. Slow exchange was seen in the apo-state, so assignments in the bound state were made using HNCO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, 15N HSQC-TOCSY, and 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC experiments. All NMR spectra were processed and analyzed using Topspin 2.0 (Bruker) and FELIX 2004 (MSI, San Diego). 1H chemical shifts were referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate, and 15N/13C chemical shifts were referenced indirectly using their respective gyromagnetic ratios. The average amide chemical shift change was calculated using Equation 2, Δδavg=(ΔδH)2+(ΔδN/5)22(Eq. 2) where ΔδH is the change in 1H chemical shift and ΔδN is the change in 15N chemical shift. Calcium imaging was performed exactly as described previously (19Stieren E. Werchan W.P. El Ayadi A. Li F. Boehning D. FAD mutations in amyloid precursor protein do not directly perturb intracellular calcium homeostasis.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) only (control) or co-transfected with YFP and PEP-19 constructs at a DNA ratio of 1:4 using Lipofectamine 2000. Twenty four hours after transfection, single cell calcium responses evoked by NaATP were recorded from all YFP-positive cells in a given field. All experiments were repeated at least three times, and the data were pooled for statistical analysis. The actual number of single cell records averaged for each condition is indicated above the bars in Fig. 6c. We used amide chemical shift perturbation to identify residues in PEP-19 that experience significant structural transitions upon binding to the C-domain of CaM because these residues will likely play key roles in regulating Ca2+ binding to CaM. C-CaM, which encodes residues 76–148 of CaM, was used for these experiments because we showed previously that PEP-19 binds to C-CaM and had the same effects on its Ca2+-binding proteins as seen for full-length CaM (20Wang X. Kleerekoper Q.K. Xiong L.W. Putkey J.A. Intrinsically disordered PEP-19 confers unique dynamic properties to apo and calcium calmodulin.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 10287-10297Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Fig. 1, a and b, shows that backbone amide chemical shifts for residues 1–30 in PEP-19 are unchanged upon binding to C-CaM in the absence or presence of Ca2+. Because free PEP-19 is intrinsically disordered (21Kleerekoper Q.K. Putkey J.A. PEP-19, an intrinsically disordered regulator of calmodulin signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7455-7464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), these data show that residues 1–30 remain disordered when bound to C-CaM. Amide chemical shift perturbations are restricted to residues in the acidic/IQ region of PEP-19 upon binding to either apo- or Ca2+-C-CaM. Based on the above chemical shift perturbations, two sets of proteins were generated to test the biochemical and functional significance of the acidic sequence in PEP-19 (see Fig. 1c). The acidic sequence is deleted in PEPΔAc such that Val-26 effectively substitutes for Glu-40 of native PEP-19. We anticipated that a hydrophobic residue at this position would promote association of PEPΔAc with both the N- and C-domains of CaM because a Phe residue at the homologous position in the CaV1.2 channel anchors its IQ region to the N-domain (22Fallon J.L. Halling D.B. Hamilton S.L. Quiocho F.A. Structure of calmodulin bound to the hydrophobic IQ domain of the cardiac Ca(v)1.2 calcium channel.Structure. 2005; 13: 1881-1886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Residues in the acidic sequence of PEPscram are randomized to determine whether the native sequence is important for modulating Ca2+ binding to CaM or whether a cluster of negative charges is sufficient. The second set of proteins was designed to test the functional significance of sequence similarity between the acidic region of PEP-19 and the consensus EF-hand Ca2+-binding site where alternating residues provide oxygens to coordinate Ca2+ at X, Y, Z and −Y,−X, and −Z positions (see Fig. 1c). Thus, Ala was substituted individually for Glu-29, Asp-31, Asp-33, Asp-35, or Glu-40. In addition, Pro-37 was changed to Gly to test the hypothesis that backbone constraints imposed by the cyclized Pro side chain dictates the relative positions of adjacent acidic residues when PEP-19 is bound to CaM, thereby affecting Ca2+ binding. Calcium-dependent Tyr fluorescence was used to measure the KCa of the C-domain of CaM in the presence or absence of native and mutated PEP-19. Table 1 shows that neither native PEP-19 nor its mutated derivatives have large effects on KCa, although most decreased the cooperativity of Ca2+ binding.TABLE 1Effect of mutants on Ca2+ binding to CaMPEP-19 proteinEquilibrium Ca2+ bindingBinding kineticsStoichiometryKCaHill coefficientkoff, 1koff, 2konCa2+/proteinμms−1s−1s−1 μm−1None1.6 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.110.4 ± 0.26.52.0PEP-192.0 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.01298 ± 101491.8mycPEP-192.0 ± 0.21.3 ± 0.04303 ± 151511.8PEPΔAcNDND11.7 ± 0.636 ± 4ND1.7PEPscram1.9 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.0510.6 ± 0.45.72.0PEP(E29A)2.3 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.03276 ± 111201.8PEP(D31A)2.4 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.01157 ± 5651.7PEP(D33A)1.6 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.0494 ± 6591.8PEP(D35A)2.4 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.1288 ± 121201.8PEP(P37G)1.6 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.0269 ± 5431.9PEP(E40A)2.4 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.03159 ± 8661.7 Open table in a new tab The relatively slow Ca2+ koff rate of 10.4 s−1 for free CaM in Table 1 is due to dissociation of 2 Ca2+ from the C-domain because dissociation of Ca2+ from the N-domain is very rapid and occurs in the dead-time (1.7 ms) of the stopped-flow fluorimeter. PEP-19 greatly increases the rate of Ca2+ dissociation to about 300 s−1, but the stoichiometry remains 2 Ca2+ released per CaM. Table 1 shows that deletion of the acidic sequence in PEPΔAc prevents the increase in Ca2+ koff. Thus, the acidic sequence of PEP-19 is required for modulation of Ca2+ binding to CaM. Interestingly, the stoichiometry of Ca2+ release in the presence of PEPΔAc is 4 Ca2+/mol of CaM instead of 2 seen the presence of all other PEP-19 proteins. This is consistent with the above prediction that PEPΔAc binds to both the N- and C-domains of CaM, thereby slowing the rate of release of Ca2+ from the N-domain as is seen for other CaM-binding proteins and peptides (23Persechini A. White H.D. Gansz K.J. Different mechanisms for Ca2+ dissociation from complexes of calmodulin with nitric oxide synthase or myosin light chain kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 62-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We confirmed this mode of binding using a donor- and acceptor-labeled CaM (CaM(DA)) (24Xiong L. Kleerekoper Q.K. He R. Putkey J.A. Hamilton S.L. Sites on calmodulin that interact with the C-terminal tail of Cav1.2 channel.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7070-7079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which gives a large decrease in fluorescence due to FRET when CaM adopts a compact structure upon binding both domains to one peptide. Fig. 2 shows that fluorescence from CaM(DA) is not greatly affected by native PEP-19 because it binds preferentially to the C-domain of CaM, but a large decrease in fluorescence is seen upon binding to either PEPΔAc or a CaM-binding peptide from CaM kinase II, CKII(293–312), which is known to bind to both domains of CaM (25Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Modulation of calmodulin plasticity in molecular recognition on the basis of x-ray structures.Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). As a further test, we generated PEP(E40F), with Phe at the homologous position to the Phe that anchors the IQ motif of the CaV1.2 channel to the N-domain of CaM (22Fallon J.L. Halling D.B. Hamilton S.L. Quiocho F.A. Structure of calmodulin bound to the hydrophobic IQ domain of the cardiac Ca(v)1.2 calcium channel.Structure. 2005; 13: 1881-1886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that PEP(E40F) also causes a large decrease in fluorescence upon binding to CaM(DA). These results show that the absence of an appropriately positioned hydrophobic group in the acidic region of PEP-19 allows preferential binding to the C-domain of CaM. Table 1 shows that PEPscram has essentially no effect on KCa, koff, kon, or the stoichiometry of Ca2+ binding to CaM. This lack of effect was so striking that we used NMR to determine whether PEPscram binds to CaM with the same domain specificity and exchange properties as native PEP-19. We showed previously that native PEP-19 binds to apo-CaM and Ca2+-CaM with characteristics of slow and fast exchange, respectively, on the NMR time scale (21Kleerekoper Q.K. Putkey J.A. PEP-19, an intrinsically disordered regulator of calmodulin signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7455-7464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that PEPscram retains these properties. Specifically, Fig. 3a shows that PEPscram binds to apo-CaM with slow to intermediate exchange on the NMR time scale, causing severe broadening of backbone amide cross-peaks for residues in the C-domain, but it has little effect on amides in the N-domain (full spectra are supplied as supplemental material). Fig. 3b shows that PEPscram also selectively binds to the C-domain of Ca2+-CaM, but with characteristics of fast exchange. Thus, both PEPscram and PEP-19 bind to the C-domain of apo- or Ca2+-CaM, and with similar exchange characteristics, but PEPscram is incapable of modulating the Ca2+ binding properties of CaM. None of the PEP-19 point mutations had significant effects on KCa of CaM, but Table 1 and Fig. 4a show that they have varying effects on koff and kon. Conversion of Glu-29 to Ala at the putative X coordination position had no effect. Mutation of Asp-31, Asp-33, or Glu-40 to Ala inhibited the ability of PEP-19 to increase koff but to different extents. The properties of PEP(D35A) are very similar to native PEP-19, even though Asp-35 at the putative −Y coordination position is centered between residues 31, 33, and 40. This could be explained by the fact that the −Y position is highly variable in canonical EF-hand Ca2+-binding loops because the backbone carbonyl oxygen, not the side chain, of this residue coordinates Ca2+. Fig. 4b shows that conversion of Pro-37 to Gly significantly decreased the ability of PEP-19 to modulate Ca2+ binding to CaM, although not to the extent seen for PEPscram. This suggests that backbone constraints imposed by the imide side chain of Pro-37 positions acidic residues in PEP-19 such that they can properly modulate Ca2+ binding to CaM. Therefore, mutation of Pro would be equivalent to mutating multiple acidic residues. This is consistent with the fact that PEPscram is incapable of modulating Ca2+ binding to CaM because it effectively has multiple acidic mutations. The distribution of acidic residues in PEP-19 led us to determine whether the acidic sequence has intrinsic Ca2+ binding activity. Its similar ionic radii and metal coordination geometries to Ca2+ make paramagnetic Tb3+ a sensitive probe for identifying Ca2+-binding sites (26Yang W. Jones L.M. Isley L. Ye Y. Lee H.W. Wilkins A. Liu Z.R. Hellinga H.W. Malchow R. Ghazi M. Yang J.J. Rational design of a calcium-binding protein.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6165-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fig. 5a shows that Tb3+ broadens backbone amide chemical shifts for residues in the acidic sequence of PEP-19, especially residues 31–36, which are severely broadened at a Tb3+/PEP-19 ratio of 1:50. Amides for Asp-33 and Asp-35 are most affected and are broadened beyond detection at a Tb3+/PEP-19 ratio of 1:100. These spectral perturbations indicate that Tb3+ binds to the acidic region in PEP-19. Although Ca2+ is not paramagnetic, we reasoned that it might affect specific amide resonance intensities due to exchange broadening if Ca2+ binds to PEP-19. Indeed, Fig. 5b shows that addition of Ca2+ to PEP-19 causes exchange broadening of amide resonances in the acidic sequence relative to other regions in PEP-19. Similar to the effect of Tb3+, Asp-33 and Asp-35 are most affected by addition of Ca2+ and show maximal broadening at a Ca2+:PEP-19 molar ratio between 1 and 2 as shown in Fig. 5c with Arg-4 in the N-domain of CaM as a control. These spectral perturbations indicate that Ca2+ binds weakly to the acidic sequence of PEP-19. We reasoned that the acidic sequence of PEP-19 with intrinsic Ca2+ binding properties may increase the Ca2+ kon if positioned near site III and/or IV of CaM by attracting or electrostatically steering Ca2+ to these binding sites. Because the contribution of electrostatic interactions would be decreased by monovalent cations, we predicted that decreasing the KCl concentration would increase the kon for Ca2+ binding to the C-domain of CaM in the presence or absence of PEP-19. Table 2 shows the KCa, koff, and kon values for Ca2+ binding to the C-domain of CaM with or without 100 mm KCl and with or without 30 μm PEP-19. The Ca2+ binding affinity is increased about 13-fold at low ionic strength due primarily to a large increase in kon. The effect of KCl on kon can be explained by electrostatic shielding of acidic side chains on CaM that coordinate or attract Ca2+. PEP-19 increases Ca2+ kon by 27- and 45-fold at 100 and 0 mm KCl, respectively. This effect of PEP-19 can be attributed, at least in part, to electrostatic steering of Ca2+ ions via weak Ca2+ binding activity of the acidic sequence in PEP-19.TABLE 2Effect of ionic strength on Ca2+ binding to CaMKClPEP-19KCaHill coefficientkoffkonmmμms−1μm−1 s−1100−1.6 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.112.5 ± 0.17.80−0.12 ± 0.011.8 ± 0.047.0 ± 0.258100+2.0 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.01428 ± 402140+0.14 ± 0.011.0 ± 0.05363 ± 242592 Open table in"
https://openalex.org/W2001328007,"Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) form a class of intracellular calcium release channels in various excitable tissues and cells such as muscles and neurons. They are the major cellular mediators of the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, an essential step in muscle excitation-contraction coupling. Several crystal structures of skeletal muscle RyR1 peptide fragments have been solved, but these cover less than 15% of the full-length RyR1 sequence. In this study, by combining modeling techniques with sub-nanometer resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps, we obtained pseudo-atomic models for RyR fragments consisting of residues 850-1,056 in rabbit RyR1 or residues 861-1,067 in mouse RyR2. These fragments are docked into a domain that connects the central vestibule and corner clamp region of RyR, resulting in a good match of the secondary structure elements in the cryo-EM map and the pseudo-atomic models, which is also consistent with our previous mappings of GFP insertions by cryo-EM and with FRET measurements involving RyR and FK506-binding protein (FKBP). A combined model of the RyR fragment and FKBP docked into the cryo-EM map suggests that the fragment is positioned adjacent to the FKBP-binding site. Its predicted binding interface with FKBP consists primarily of electrostatic contacts and contains several disease-associated mutations. A dynamic interaction between the fragment and an RyR phosphorylation domain, characterized by FRET experiments, also supports the structural predictions of the pseudo-atomic models."
https://openalex.org/W1815385094,"Many snake venoms are known for their antithrombotic activity. They contain components that specifically target different platelet-activating receptors such as the collagen-binding integrin α2β1 and the von Willebrand factor receptor GPIb. In a search for an α2β1 integrin-blocking component from the venom of the habu snake (Trimeresurus flavoviridis), we employed two independent purification protocols. First, we used the integrin α2A domain, a major collagen-binding domain, as bait for affinity purification of an α2β1 integrin-binding toxin from the crude venom. Second, in parallel, we used classical protein separation protocols and tested for α2β1 integrin-inhibiting capabilities by ELISA. Using both approaches, we identified flavocetin-A as an inhibitor of α2β1 integrin. Hitherto, flavocetin-A has been reported as a GPIb inhibitor. However, flavocetin-A inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation even after GPIb was blocked with other inhibitors. Moreover, flavocetin-A antagonized α2β1 integrin-mediated adhesion and migration of HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells, which lack any GPIb, on collagen. Protein chemical analyses proved that flavocetin-A binds to α2β1 integrin and its α2A domain with high affinity and in a cooperative manner, which most likely is due to its quaternary structure. Kinetic measurements confirmed the formation of a strong complex between integrin and flavocetin-A, which dissociates very slowly. This study proves that flavocetin-A, which has long been known as a GPIb inhibitor, efficiently targets α2β1 integrin and thus blocks collagen-induced platelet activation. Moreover, our findings suggest that the separation of GPIb- and α2β1 integrin-blocking members within the C-type lectin-related protein family is less strict than previously assumed."
