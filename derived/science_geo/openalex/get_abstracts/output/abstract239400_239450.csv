https://openalex.org/W2098622411,"The establishment of neural circuitry requires vast numbers of synapses to be generated during a specific window of brain development, but it is not known why the developing mammalian brain has a much greater capacity to generate new synapses than the adult brain. Here we report that immature but not mature astrocytes express thrombospondins (TSPs)-1 and -2 and that these TSPs promote CNS synaptogenesis in vitro and in vivo. TSPs induce ultrastructurally normal synapses that are presynaptically active but postsynaptically silent and work in concert with other, as yet unidentified, astrocyte-derived signals to produce functional synapses. These studies identify TSPs as CNS synaptogenic proteins, provide evidence that astrocytes are important contributors to synaptogenesis within the developing CNS, and suggest that TSP-1 and -2 act as a permissive switch that times CNS synaptogenesis by enabling neuronal molecules to assemble into synapses within a specific window of CNS development.

Is synaptogenesis controlled solely by the pre- and postsynaptic neurons, or are there pivotal nonneuronal determinants that help to control the timing, location, and number of synapses that form? We have been investigating the role of astrocytes, which ensheathe synapses throughout the CNS, in controlling synaptogenesis. In previous studies, we found that, when purified rat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are cultured in defined serum-free conditions that fully support their survival and growth, they form few synapses unless cultured with astrocytes, as measured by electrophysiology, FM1-43 imaging, immunostaining, and electron microscopy (Mauch et al., 2001Mauch D.H.

Similarly, purified spinal motor neurons form few synapses unless cultured with Schwann cells or astrocytes (Ullian et al., 2004cUllian E.M. Harris B.T. Wu A. Chan J.R.

Culturing RGCs under feeding layers of astrocytes, without direct contact, is sufficient to enhance synapse number, indicating that these effects are mediated by one or more soluble signals secreted by astrocytes (Nagler et al., 2001Nagler K.

Christopherson K.S. Barres B.A. Control of synapse number by glia.Science. 2001; 291: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). The astrocyte-induced increase in synapse number is not due to the absence of the normal target of these neurons because the same increase in RGC synapse number and function is induced between RGCs and their normal target neurons purified from the superior colliculus (Ullian et al., 2001Ullian E.M.

What is the identity of these astrocyte-secreted signals? Here we identify thrombospondin family members (TSPs) as necessary and sufficient synaptogenic components of astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM). TSPs are large oligomeric extracellular matrix proteins that mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions by binding an array of membrane receptors, other extracellular matrix proteins, and cytokines (Adams, 2001Adams J.C.

The functions of thrombospondin-1 and -2.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). There are five TSPs, each encoded by a separate gene. Although several TSPs are expressed in the brain, the functions of these TSPs are unknown (Adams and Tucker, 2000Adams J.C. Tucker R.P. The thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) superfamily.Dev.

TSP1 and TSP2 are closely related trimeric proteins that share the same set of structural and functional domains. TSP4, which is pentameric and has a different domain structure from TSP1 and TSP2, is present in the adult nervous system where it is localized to some CNS synapses as well as the neuromuscular junction (Arber and Caroni, 1995Arber S. Caroni P. Thrombospondin-4, an extracellular matrix protein expressed in the nervous system, promotes neurite outgrowth.J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The findings we report here identify TSPs as astrocyte-secreted proteins that promote the formation of ultrastructurally normal CNS synapses and reveal that additional, as yet unidentified, astrocyte-derived signals control postsynaptic function. In order to establish an assay for biochemical studies to identify synaptogenic activities secreted by astrocytes, we compared the ability of astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) and astrocyte feeding layers (“Astros”) to induce synapses on RGCs (Figure 1A ). Synapses were detected as yellow puncta, representing colocalization of immunoreactivity to the pre- and postsynaptic markers synaptotagmin and PSD-95, respectively. Each yellow punctum corresponds to the site of a single functional synapse (Ullian et al., 2001Ullian E.M. Sapperstein S.K. Christopherson K.S. Barres B.A. Control of synapse number by glia.Science. 2001; 291: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). As previously described (Ullian et al., 2001Ullian E.M. Sapperstein S.K. Christopherson K.S. Barres B.A. Control of synapse number by glia.Science. 2001; 291: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), RGCs cultured for several days below a feeding layer of astrocytes have 7-fold more functional synapses than RGCs cultured alone, as assayed by whole-cell patch recording (Figure 1B). When RGCs were cultured in ACM, there was an increase in the number of structural synapses, indicated by an increase in both the number and colocalization of pre- and postsynaptic puncta in the presence of ACM (Figure 1A); however, these synapses were not functional, as indicated by the frequency of synaptic currents (Figure 1B). Despite this lack of function, quantification of immunostaining showed that ACM induced as many structural synapses as an astrocyte feeding layer (Figure 1C). This suggests that there are at least two signals secreted by astrocytes: one that is present in ACM that increases the number of structural synapses and a second signal either not produced in the absence of RGCs or lost during preparation of ACM (data not shown) that induces functionality. Having established an assay in which ACM exhibits the same ability to induce synaptic puncta as an astrocyte feeding layer, we next investigated the molecular weight of the synaptogenic ACM component. We found that all of the synapse-promoting activity in ACM was larger than 100 kDa (Figure 1C), and the majority of the activity was still retained with a 300 kDa cutoff filter (data not shown). To test whether ApoE-containing particles could be responsible for the activity as previously reported (Mauch et al., 2001Mauch D.H. Nagler K. Schumacher S. Goritz C. Muller E.C. Otto A. Pfrieger F.W. CNS synaptogenesis promoted by glia-derived cholesterol.Science. 2001; 294: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar), we immunodepleted ApoE-containing complexes from ACM. Despite depletion of virtually all of the ApoE protein, ACM induced the same number of synapses (see Supplemental Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). In addition, we found that treatment of RGCs with either ApoE (data not shown) or cholesterol (Figures 1D and 1F) had no effect on synapse number. Therefore, ApoE bound cholesterol is not responsible for the synapse-promoting activity of ACM. However, cholesterol does strongly enhance synaptic efficacy, as previously reported (Mauch et al., 2001Mauch D.H. Nagler K. Schumacher S. Goritz C. Muller E.C. Otto A. Pfrieger F.W. CNS synaptogenesis promoted by glia-derived cholesterol.Science. 2001; 294: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar; Supplemental Figure S1). The large size of the synaptogenic ACM activity, together with our unpublished observation that the activity is heparin binding (data not shown), strongly suggested the possibility that the activity is an extracellular matrix protein. We investigated the possibility that TSPs contribute to the synaptogenic activity of ACM because TSPs form large >500 kDa oligomeric complexes, are made by astrocytes in vitro and in vivo (Adams and Tucker, 2000Adams J.C.

Caroni P. Thrombospondin-4, an extracellular matrix protein expressed in the nervous system, promotes neurite outgrowth.J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Purified TSP1 from human platelets increased the number of synaptic puncta in RGCs to a similar degree as ACM (Figures 1D and 1E). The number of puncta per RGC induced by TSP1 increased in a dose-dependent manner with concentrations of TSP1 ranging from 2 to 20 nM; 10 nM was the plateau concentration and was used in all subsequent experiments (data not shown). We found no difference in the average radii or the distance between the centers of colocalized puncta between conditions (Supplemental Table S1), indicating that the increase in synapse number was not simply due to an increase in the size of the few synaptic puncta present in control conditions. TSP1-induced synaptic puncta exhibited immunoreactivity for a large variety of presynaptic proteins including synaptotagmin, synapsin, and Bassoon as well as postsynaptic proteins including PSD-95, SAP102, and Homer (Supplemental Figure S6). To determine whether the increase in synapse number by TSP1 involved increased levels of synaptic proteins, we measured protein levels in control RGCs and RGCs treated with TSP1. Similar to our previous results with astrocytes (Ullian et al., 2001Ullian E.M. Sapperstein S.K. Christopherson K.S. Barres B.A. Control of synapse number by glia.Science. 2001; 291: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), we found that RGCs treated with TSP1 did not have significantly increased levels of synaptic proteins compared to control cultures (Supplemental Figure S2), indicating that TSP is affecting synaptic protein localization. In addition, the increase in synapses seen with TSP1 treatment was not due to an increase in axon length (DeFreitas et al., 1995DeFreitas M.F. Yoshida C.K. Frazier W.A. Mendrick D.L. Kypta R.M.

To determine whether the synaptogenic effect was specific to TSP1, we tested a panel of extracellular matrix molecules known to be secreted by astrocytes (including fibronectin, vitronectin, tenascin C, osteonectin/SPARC, osteopontin, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans A and C, biglycan, decorin, and agrin) as well as battery of peptide trophic factors (including TNFα, Il-6, GDNF, bFGF, TGFβ1, HGF, and pleiotrophin). None of these molecules had a significant effect on synapse number (Supplemental Figure S3). In addition, BDNF, CNTF, and insulin are present in our medium even in control conditions where few synapses form. Are the ACM- and TSP1-induced synapses ultrastructurally normal? We used electron microscopy to study ACM- and TSP1-induced synapses in fine detail. Synapses induced by TSP1 and ACM were ultrastructurally identical to the electrophysiologically active synapses induced by a feeding layer of astrocytes. Pre- and postsynaptic specializations could be easily detected in RGCs cultured under both conditions as well as with an astrocyte feeding layer (Figure 2A ). There was no difference in the length or thickness of the postsynaptic density (PSD) between synapses induced by TSP1 or an astrocyte feeding layer (PSD length, 380 ± 197 nm [TSP] versus 398 ± 209 nm [Astro, p = 0.8]; PSD thickness, 46 ± 5 nm [TSP] versus 50 ± 8 nm [Astro, p = 0.7]). The number of vesicles per synapse and the number of docked vesicles per synapse were not statistically different between these three conditions (Figure 2B), and the increase in synapse number in all cases was comparable to our immunostaining results (Figure 2C). These findings demonstrate that TSP1 is sufficient to induce ultrastructurally normal synapses and provide evidence that the synaptic structures we detect by immunostaining likely correspond to the fully developed synaptic structures we observe by EM. Which TSPs are expressed by cultured astrocytes? Of the five members of the TSP family, TSP1 and -2 are highly related and share common functional domains, while TSP -3, -4, and -5/COMP lack some of the domains present in TSP1/2 (Adams, 2001Adams J.C. Thrombospondins: multifunctional regulators of cell interactions.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis of mRNA isolated from astrocytes in culture indicated expression of both TSP1 and TSP2 (data not shown). However, we were only able to detect protein for TSP2 by Western blotting of ACM and astrocyte cell lysate with TSP1- and TSP2-specific antibodies (data not shown and Figure 3C ), even though the TSP1 antibody recognizes rat TSP1 in serum (data not shown) and rat brain lysate (Figure 5E). Is TSP2 synaptogenic? We found that recombinant TSP2 (rTSP2) increased synapse number in RGCs to a similar degree as TSP1 (Figures 3A and 3B). This finding indicates that TSP1 and TSP2 both promote synaptogenesis. In addition, the synaptogenic activity of recombinant TSP2 provides evidence that the activity in purified platelet TSP1 is not due to copurification of a TSP binding protein. This conclusion is further supported by the lack of visible contaminating proteins in the recombinant TSP2 used for these experiments when analyzed by Coomassie staining. Is TSP2 a necessary component of the ACM activity? When we treated RGCs with ACM and TSP1 together, the increase in synapse number was not larger than that observed with treatment by either alone (Figure 1E), suggesting that ACM and TSP1 share a common pathway. To test directly whether TSP2 is necessary, we immunodepleted TSP2 from ACM with a TSP2-specific antibody (Figure 3C). RGCs cultured in TSP2-depleted ACM developed several-fold fewer synaptic puncta compared to nondepleted ACM, reducing the number of synapses induced to control levels (Figure 3D). Interestingly, despite the lack of double-labeled synaptic puncta in RGCs cultured with TSP2-depleted ACM, there was still a significant increase in the number of single-labeled puncta containing nonoverlapping synaptotagmin or PSD-95 immunoreactivity (Figure 3E). These findings demonstrate that TSP2 is necessary for astrocytes to enhance synaptogenesis and suggest that TSP2 may normally enhance synaptogenesis by inducing or maintaining the alignment and/or adherence of pre- and postsynaptic specializations. Despite their potent effects on increasing structural synapse number, neither ACM, TSP1, nor TSP2 increased synaptic activity as measured by whole-cell patch clamp recording (Figure 4A ; Supplemental Figure S4). In contrast, astrocyte feeding layers significantly increased the frequency of synaptic events (Figure 4A). We next investigated whether the TSP1- and ACM-induced synapses were presynaptically active by measuring vesicular release using an antibody to the luminal domain of the vesicular protein synaptotagmin and the styryl dye FM2-10, both of which are taken up in an activity-dependent manner when synaptic vesicles recycle (Kraszewski et al., 1995Kraszewski K. Mundigl O. Daniell L. Verderio C. Matteoli M. De Camilli P. Synaptic vesicle dynamics in living cultured hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4328-4342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Double immunolabeling indicates that most presynaptic puncta overlapped with PSD-95 postsynaptic puncta in all conditions. TSP1, ACM, and an astrocyte feeding layer all increased the number of sites of spontaneous synaptic vesicular recycling in RGCs to a similar extent (Figure 4B; Supplemental Figure S5). This was not due to a general increase in synaptic proteins (Supplemental Figure S2; Ullian et al., 2001Ullian E.M. Sapperstein S.K. Christopherson K.S. Barres B.A. Control of synapse number by glia.Science. 2001; 291: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). In addition, the fold increase in the number of presynaptically active puncta per cell in all three conditions was similar to the fold increase in the number of structural synapses measured by immunostaining and EM, consistent with the sites of vesicular recycling corresponding to synaptic sites. These results indicate that the majority of synapses induced by astrocyte feeding layers, ACM, and TSP1 are presynaptically active. To assess postsynaptic function, we first examined whole-cell responses of RGCs cultured in the presence of TSP1 or ACM to applied glutamate and found that responses were not increased above control levels (Figure 4C). To specifically look at synaptic receptors, we measured the amplitudes of spontaneous miniature events (mEPSCs). The cumulative mEPSC amplitude distribution shows that the synaptic events recorded in RGCs cultured with either TSP1 or ACM are smaller than those induced by a feeding layer of astrocytes and are about 5-fold less sensitive to glutamate (Figure 4D). This suggests that there is a second signal generated in the presence of astrocyte feeding layers that functions by either recruiting glutamate receptors to the synapse or by activating them. Despite the lack of functional AMPA receptors at ACM- and TSP1-induced synapses, TSP1-induced synapses exhibited normal postsynaptic densities by EM that are strongly immunoreactive for the postsynaptic proteins PSD-95, SAP-102, and Homer (Supplemental Figure S6). Thus, whereas astrocyte-induced synapses are fully functional, both ACM- and TSP1-induced synapses are presynaptically active but are postsynaptically silent, containing fewer functional AMPARs. These similar properties of ACM- and TSP1-induced synapses provide further evidence that TSPs are a component of the synaptogenic activity of ACM. RGC synaptic responses in vitro and in vivo are largely AMPA receptor mediated, with a small NMDA receptor-mediated component in the absence of Mg2+ (Chen and Diamond, 2002Chen S. Diamond J.S. Synaptically released glutamate activates extrasynaptic NMDA receptors on cells in the ganglion cell layer of rat retina.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2165-2173PubMed Google Scholar, Ullian et al., 2004aUllian E.M. Barkis W.B. Chen S. Diamond J.S. Barres B.A. Invulnerability of retinal ganglion cells to NMDA excitotoxicity.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 544-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether TSP1-induced synapses release glutamate that can activate postsynaptic NMDA receptors, we analyzed the evoked responses of RGCs treated with TSP1 or astrocyte feeding layers in the presence and absence of Mg2+. In contrast to astrocyte feeding layer-induced synapses, RGCs treated with TSP1 exhibited no AMPA component to the evoked response when currents were elicited in the presence of Mg2+, but a small NMDA component was detectable in the absence of Mg2+ (Supplemental Figure S4). Thus, despite the lack of postsynaptic AMPA receptors, the TSP-induced synapses are functional in that they release glutamate and exhibit small NMDAR-mediated components of the evoked response. To determine whether TSP1 and TSP2 are expressed in the developing brain, we used antiserum against TSP1 to immunostain postnatal brain, the age at which the bulk of synaptogenesis occurs. It is not clear whether this antiserum also recognizes the highly related isoform TSP2, so we refer to the immunoreactivity as TSP1/2. TSP1/2 immunoreactivity was observed throughout the postnatal day 8 (P8) cortex, superior colliculus, and retina, and appears diffuse and widespread, as expected for a matrix molecule secreted by astrocytes (Figure 5 and data not shown). Interestingly, TSP1/2 immunoreactivity was also seen in discrete puncta that colocalized with the synaptic marker synaptotagmin in both cortex (Figure 5A) and superior colliculus (Figure 5B). We also found extensive colocalization of TSP1/2 with ezrin (Figure 5C), a marker of the fine astrocyte processes that ensheathe synapses in the postnatal CNS (Derouiche and Frotscher, 2001Derouiche A. Frotscher M. Peripheral astrocyte processes: monitoring by selective immunostaining for the actin-binding ERM proteins.Glia. 2001; 36: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TSP1/2 immunoreactivity largely disappeared in these brain regions by postnatal day 21 (P21; Figure 5D), suggesting that TSP1 and TSP2 serve a transient function and are not required for maintenance of synapses in the adult. In order to more directly determine whether TSP1 and TSP2 proteins are present in the postnatal and adult rat brain, we used TSP1- and TSP2-specific antibodies, which work well for Western blotting but not immunostaining, to look at protein expression. Both TSP1 and TSP2 proteins were detected in extracts prepared from rat P5 cortex (Figure 5E) and whole brain (data not shown). As we observed for the immunoreactivity, both TSP1 and TSP2 protein levels were very low or absent in adult brain. To further examine which TSPs are present in astrocytes in postnatal brain, we performed RT-PCR on mRNA isolated from highly purified, acutely isolated astrocytes from P5 rat cortex. Both TSP1 and TSP2 mRNAs were detected (data not shown). Taken together, these results show that both TSP1 and TSP2 are present in the developing brain, where they are highly localized to astrocytes, and are downregulated in adult brain. In order to determine if TSP1 and TSP2 play a role in CNS synapse formation in vivo, we examined synapse number in brain cryosections prepared from wild-type (wt) mice and mice lacking TSP1, TSP2, or both (Agah et al., 2002Agah A. Kyriakides T.R. Lawler J. Bornstein P. The lack of thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) dictates the course of wound healing in double-TSP1/TSP2-null mice.Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 831-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) by immunostaining with antibodies to synaptic markers followed by confocal imaging (Figure 6A ). No decrease in synapse number was detected in TSP1- or TSP2-deficient mice. However, in the TSP1/2 double null cerebral cortex, there was a 40% decrease in synaptic puncta at P8 as quantified by SV2 immunoreactivity (Figure 6B). Even by P21, a time when synapse number has normally plateaued, there was still a 25% decrease in synaptic puncta compared to wt controls (Figure 6C). A similar decrease in synapse number was observed in TSP1/2 double null brain sections from the superior colliculus (data not shown). There was substantial variability between brain regions and mice, with decreases in cortical synapse number that ranged as high as 50% in some cases. Similar results were obtained using antibodies to other synaptic proteins including Bassoon and PSD-95, indicating that the decreased puncta likely corresponded to a decrease in synapse number rather than simply a decrease in the synaptic localization of a particular protein. To verify that these puncta correspond to synapses as defined by colocalization of pre- and postsynaptic proteins, we double labeled cryosections of P21 wt and TSP1/2 double null brains using antibodies to the presynaptic protein Bassoon (BSN) and the postsynaptic protein SAP-102 (Lim et al., 2002Lim A. Hall D.D. Hell J.W. Selectivity and promiscuity of the first and second PDZ domains of PSD-95 and synapse-associated protein 102.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21697-21711Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar; Figure 7A ). We used novel trichloroacetic acid fixation conditions that allowed both pre- and postsynaptic markers to be simultaneously immunostained. We saw a similar 31% decrease in the number of colocalized pre- and postsynaptic puncta in TSP1/2-deficient brains compared to wt (Figure 7B). Similar to our cell culture results, we did not see an overall decrease in the levels of synaptic proteins in TSP1/2 double null brains compared to wt (Supplemental Figure S7). To determine whether the effect of TSP1/2 deficiency on synapse number was direct and not secondary to effects on cell survival, proliferation, or migration, we counted the number of DAPI-stained nuclei per section in P21 cortex. We found no significant difference in the number of DAPI nuclei between wt and TSP1/2 double null brains (85 ± ten nuclei per area wt; 97 ± ten nuclei per area TSP1/2 double null, p = 0.4). In addition, there was no obvious difference in the morphology of cortical structures or layers. To determine whether the effect of deleting TSP1/2 on synapse number was due to defects in dendritic arborization, we quantified the density of dendritic fields in synaptic areas of the cortex. We found no significant morphological difference in dendritic structures or dendritic arbor density between wt and TSP1/2 double null brains at P21 or P8 (Figures 7C and 7D). These data, together with the persistent decrease in synapse number at the nearly adult age of P21, provide evidence that the decrease in synapse number in TSP1/2-deficient mice cannot be explained by a decrease in cell number or dendritic number or length but rather is due to a specific inability to form or maint"

In a screen for small molecules that protect cells from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, we identified salubrinal, a selective inhibitor of cellular complexes that dephosphorylate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit α (eIF2α). Salubrinal also blocks eIF2α dephosphorylation mediated by a herpes simplex virus protein and inhibits viral replication. These results suggest that selective chemical inhibitors of eIF2α dephosphorylation may be useful in diseases involving ER stress or viral infection.

Artificially introduced 2'-O-methyl groups in small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can stabilize siRNAs in serum without affecting their activities in RNA interference in mammalian cells. Here, we show that plant microRNAs (miRNAs) have a naturally occurring methyl group on the ribose of the last nucleotide. Whereas methylation of rRNAs depends on guide RNAs, the methyltransferase protein HEN1 is sufficient to methylate miRNA/miRNA* duplexes. Our studies uncover a new and crucial step in plant miRNA biogenesis and have profound implications in the function of miRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2042082129,"Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are a unique class of G protein-coupled receptors that play critical roles in thrombosis, inflammation, and vascular biology. PAR1 is proposed to be involved in the invasive and metastatic processes of various cancers. However, the protease responsible for activating the proinvasive functions of PAR1 remains to be identified. Here, we show that expression of PAR1 is both required and sufficient to promote growth and invasion of breast carcinoma cells in a xenograft model. Further, we show that the matrix metalloprotease, MMP-1, functions as a protease agonist of PAR1 cleaving the receptor at the proper site to generate PAR1-dependent Ca2+ signals and migration. MMP-1 activity is derived from fibroblasts and is absent from the breast cancer cells. These results demonstrate that MMP-1 in the stromal-tumor microenvironment can alter the behavior of cancer cells through PAR1 to promote cell migration and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W1998861353,"Vertebrate members of the nuclear receptor NR5A subfamily, which includes steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) and liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1), regulate crucial aspects of development, endocrine homeostasis, and metabolism. Mouse LRH-1 is believed to be a ligand-independent transcription factor with a large and empty hydrophobic pocket. Here we present structural and biochemical data for three other NR5A members-mouse and human SF-1 and human LRH-1-which reveal that these receptors bind phosphatidyl inositol second messengers and that ligand binding is required for maximal activity. Evolutionary analysis of structure-function relationships across the SF-1/LRH-1 subfamily indicates that ligand binding is the ancestral state of NR5A receptors and was uniquely diminished or altered in the rodent LRH-1 lineage. We propose that phospholipids regulate gene expression by directly binding to NR5A nuclear receptors."

The eukaryotic mitotic machinery uses the cytoskeleton to move specific chromosomal regions. To investigate the potential role of the actin-like MreB protein in bacterial chromosome segregation, we first demonstrate that MreB is the direct target of the small molecule A22. We then demonstrate that A22 completely blocks the movement of newly replicated loci near the origin of replication but has no qualitative or quantitative effect on the segregation of other loci if added after origin segregation. MreB selectively interacts, directly or indirectly, with origin-proximal regions of the chromosome, arguing that the origin-proximal region segregates via an MreB-dependent mechanism not used by the rest of the chromosome."

Our data reveal a presynaptic role of a previously unknown p38 MAP kinase cascade. Chemical synapses are asymmetric cellular junctions between presynaptic neurons and their postsynaptic targets. At presynaptic terminals, synaptic vesicles are densely clustered at release sites known as active zones (Murthy and De Camilli, 2003Murthy V.N. De Camilli P. Cell biology of the presynaptic terminal.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 701-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Active zones contain cellular machinery necessary for exocytosis of synaptic vesicles and appear as electron-dense membrane specializations. The size and shape of active zones and the number of associated vesicles vary according to the type of synapse. In the vertebrate CNS, most presynaptic terminals contain a single active zone associated with a cluster of vesicles (Schikorski and Stevens, 1997Schikorski T. Stevens C.F.

A key issue in synaptogenesis is that of how the formation of presynaptic specializations and the establishment of vesicle clusters are coordinated to give rise to the stereotyped appearance of functional presynaptic terminals. A conserved family of proteins that includes Drosophila Highwire (Hiw), C. elegans RPM-1, and Mammalian Phr1 and Pam has been shown to influence synapse development (Burgess et al., 2004Burgess R.W.

Such Pam/Highwire/RPM-1 (PHR) family proteins are unusually large and contain several functional domains, including a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain and a RING H2 finger that likely confers E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Drosophila Highwire negatively regulates glutamatergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ) bouton growth; in Hiw mutants, NMJ bouton number is increased (Wan et al., 2000Wan H.I. DiAntonio A. Fetter R.D.

In Phr1 mutant mice, peripheral motor and sensory endings show a range of synaptic defects accompanied by sprouting of nerve terminals (Burgess et al., 2004Burgess R.W. Peterson K.A. Johnson M.J. Roix J.J. Welsh I.C. O’Brien T.P. Evidence for a conserved function in synapse formation reveals Phr1 as a candidate gene for respiratory failure in newborn mice.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1096-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, most synapses form en passant, i.e., at subterminal varicosities along axonal processes (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode C. elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314B: 1-340Crossref Google Scholar). Complete loss of function in rpm-1 causes a range of aberrant presynaptic morphologies: some presynaptic varicosities have several presynaptic densities within a single cluster of synaptic vesicles, whereas others fail to differentiate or have fewer vesicles (Schaefer et al., 2000Schaefer A.M.

Some rpm-1 mutant neurons display excessive sprouting. Highwire and RPM-1 both function presynaptically and are localized to subdomains of the presynaptic terminal known as the periactive zone, which surrounds the synaptic vesicle clusters and active zones (Sone et al., 2000Sone M. Suzuki E. Hoshino M. Hou D. Kuromi H. Fukata M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Nabeshima Y. Hama C. Synaptic development is controlled in the periactive zones of Drosophila synapses.Development. 2000; 127: 4157-4168PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, PHR family proteins have a conserved role as presynaptic regulators of synapse formation and/or growth, although the nature of the defect in mutants depends on the synapse type. PHR proteins have been implicated in several signaling pathways. PHR proteins likely act as ubiquitin ligases. Hiw genetically interacts with the deubiquitinase fat facets (DiAntonio et al., 2001DiAntonio A. Haghighi A.P. Portman S.L. Lee J.D. Amaranto A.M. Goodman C.S. Ubiquitination-dependent mechanisms regulate synaptic growth and function.Nature. 2001; 412: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and RPM-1 binds to the F-box protein FSN-1 (Liao et al., 2004Liao E.H. Hung W. Abrams B. Zhen M. An SCF-like ubiquitin ligase complex that controls presynaptic differentiation.Nature. 2004; 430: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The targets of PHR-mediated ubiquitination, however, are not known. Hiw can bind the Smad protein Medea (McCabe et al., 2004McCabe B.D. Hom S. Aberle H. Fetter R.D. Marques G. Haerry T.E. Wan H. O’Connor M.B. Goodman C.S. Haghighi A.P. Highwire regulates presynaptic BMP signaling essential for synaptic growth.Neuron. 2004; 41: 891-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), but it is yet not known if Hiw directly influences the stability of Medea. The periactive zone of Drosophila NMJs contains additional molecules known to regulate presynaptic architecture, including Fasciclin II, the RhoGEF Still-life (Sone et al., 2000Sone M. Suzuki E. Hoshino M. Hou D. Kuromi H. Fukata M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Nabeshima Y. Hama C. Synaptic development is controlled in the periactive zones of Drosophila synapses.Development. 2000; 127: 4157-4168PubMed Google Scholar), and the adaptor protein Nervous Wreck (Coyle et al., 2004Coyle I.P. Koh Y.H. Lee W.C. Slind J. Fergestad T. Littleton J.T. Ganetzky B. Nervous wreck, an SH3 adaptor protein that interacts with Wsp, regulates synaptic growth in Drosophila.Neuron. 2004; 41: 521-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It remains to be addressed whether these periactive zone proteins interact with Hiw. Human Pam is a potent inhibitor of adenylate cyclase (Scholich et al., 2001Scholich K. Pierre S. Patel T.B. Protein associated with Myc (PAM) is a potent inhibitor of adenylyl cyclases.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47583-47589Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Pam and Hiw interact with the tuberin-hamartin complex (TSC1/2) (Murthy et al., 2004Murthy V. Han S. Beauchamp R.L. Smith N. Haddad L.A. Ito N. Ramesh V. Pam and its ortholog highwire interact with and may negatively regulate the TSC1.TSC2 complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), although the role of this interaction at synapses is not known. We have used a genetic approach to identify genes that functionally interact with rpm-1 in synaptogenesis. We report that a p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade functions in presynaptic cells and is negatively controlled by RPM-1. p38 MAP kinases have been extensively studied in immunity, stress responses, and neuronal apoptosis (Johnson and Lapadat, 2002Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways mediated by ERK, JNK, and p38 protein kinases.Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3240) Google Scholar). Recent studies reveal roles for p38 MAP kinases in synaptic plasticity (Thomas and Huganir, 2004Thomas G.M. Huganir R.L. MAPK cascade signalling and synaptic plasticity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Activation of p38 in postsynaptic cells induces long-term depression (LTD) in hippocampal neurons and in Aplysia (Bolshakov et al., 2000Bolshakov V.Y. Carboni L. Cobb M.H. Siegelbaum S.A.

Ras and Rap control AMPA receptor trafficking during synaptic plasticity.Cell. 2002; 110: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Our findings establish a presynaptic role for p38 in synaptic development. We also show that the MAPKKK DLK-1 and the MAPKK MKK-4 act upstream of p38 at the synapse. The activity of these kinases is critical for normal synapse morphology. DLK-1 is localized to the periactive zone. DLK-1::GFP abundance is increased in rpm-1 mutants. DLK-1 can associate with and be ubiquitinated by RPM-1 in 293T cells. We propose that presynaptic development is normally limited at the periactive zone by RPM-1-dependent downregulation of a p38 MAP kinase cascade. The C. elegans GABAergic type D motor neurons form en passant synapses with ventral and dorsal body wall muscles (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode C. elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314B: 1-340Crossref Google Scholar). We visualized the presynaptic terminals of these neurons using GFP-tagged synaptobrevin (SNB-1::GFP, transgene juIs1 [Hallam and Jin, 1998Hallam S.J. Jin Y. lin-14 regulates the timing of synaptic remodelling in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 1998; 395: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar]). In wild-type animals, SNB-1::GFP puncta are uniform in shape and size and distributed evenly along the nerve cords (Figures 1A and 1B). In rpm-1 loss-of-function (lf) mutants, SNB-1::GFP puncta are reduced in number and are irregular in shape and size (Figures 1C and 1D). Despite these defects, rpm-1 mutants do not display overt behavioral or developmental defects. rpm-1 mutations display synthetic interactions with other synaptogenesis mutations. For example, syd-1 mutants display mild defects in locomotion and egg-laying behavior (Egl), reflecting aberrant distribution of presynaptic components (Hallam et al., 2002Hallam S.J. Goncharov A. McEwen J. Baran R. Jin Y. SYD-1, a presynaptic protein with PDZ, C2 and rhoGAP-like domains, specifies axon identity in C. elegans.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast to rpm-1 or syd-1 single mutants, syd-1; rpm-1 double mutants are severely defective in locomotion (see Supplemental Figure S1 in the supplemental data available with this article online), reflecting reductions in synapse number and disrupted presynaptic organization (A.G. and Y.J., unpublished data). We took advantage of these synthetic phenotypes to identify suppressors of the rpm-1 synaptic phenotypes. We mutagenized syd-1;rpm-1 double mutants and isolated F2 progeny that showed improved locomotion and normal body size but which retained the Syd-1 Egl phenotype (see Experimental Procedures; Supplemental Figure S1). By backcrossing, we reisolated these putative suppressor mutations in an rpm-1 single mutant background and examined their synaptic morphology using the Punc-25 SNB-1::GFP marker (Figures 1E–1J). We selected a subset of suppressors that showed strong suppression of the synaptic morphology defects of rpm-1 in a non-allele-specific manner. Animals carrying the suppressor mutations in an rpm-1(+) background are grossly normal in morphology (Supplemental Figure S1) and show subtle locomotor defects (data not shown) and defects in synaptic vesicle distribution (Figure 3). As described below, most of the suppressors exhibit semidominant suppression of rpm-1. To clone the genes defined by the suppressor mutations, we mapped their suppression of the rpm-1 synaptic morphology defects (see Experimental Procedures). We then performed germline transformation experiments to rescue the suppression phenotype in rpm-1; sup double mutants (sup refers to any suppressor mutation). We found that three groups of suppressor mutations affected the genes dlk-1, mkk-4, and pmk-3, which encode MAP kinases (Supplemental Figures S2 and S3). DLK-1 is the C. elegans member of the dual leucine zipper-bearing (DLK) kinase subfamily of mixed lineage MAPKKKs (Figure 1K, Supplemental Figure S3). Unlike other DLK MAPKKKs, which have two leucine zipper repeats, DLK-1 has only one. MKK-4 is the closest C. elegans homolog of the MKK4 family of MAPKK (Supplemental Figure S3). PMK-3 is one of three p38α-like MAP kinases in C. elegans (Supplemental Figures S2 and S3) and has p38 kinase activity in vitro (Berman et al., 2001Berman K. McKay J. Avery L. Cobb M. Isolation and characterization of pmk-(1–3): three p38 homologs in Caenorhabditis elegans.Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 2001; 4: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The suppressor mutations that affect each kinase gene cause missense alterations of conserved residues in the kinase domains, or nonsense mutations (Figure 1K, Supplemental Figure S3). Such lesions suggest that most suppressor mutations severely reduced or abolished the activities of the three kinase genes. A deletion of pmk-3 suppressed rpm-1 phenotypes to the same degree as our pmk-3 mutations (data not shown). Furthermore, the suppression of the synaptic defects in rpm-1(ju44); mkk-4(ju91) double mutants was rescued by transgenes expressing wild-type mkk-4 but not by transgenes expressing mutated MKK-4 in which the catalytic residue Lys95 was mutated (mkk-4[K95R], Table 1) (Chen et al., 2001Chen Z.

We conclude that suppression of rpm-1 is due to loss of function in the kinase genes.Table 1Transgene Analysis of MAP KinasesTransgene (Plasmid)Genetic BackgroundRescueaRescue activity was scored by observing Punc-25 SNB-1::GFP (juIs1). +, rescue; –, no rescue.Number of LinesPdlk-1 dlk-1(+) (pCZ592)dlk-1(ju476); rpm-1(ju44)+3Pdlk-1 dlk-1::GFP (pCZ593)dlk-1(ju476); rpm-1(ju44)+1PF25B3.3 dlk-1(+) (pCZ680)dlk-1(ju476); rpm-1(ju44)+2Punc-25 dlk-1::GFP (pCZ690)eSee Supplemental Figure S5 for quantitation.dlk-1(ju476); rpm-1(ju44)+4Pmkk-4 mkk-4(+) (pCZ594)bInjected at 5–50 pg/µl DNA concentration.rpm-1(ju44); mkk-4(ju91)+6Pmkk-4 mkk-4(K95R) (pCZ603)rpm-1(ju44); mkk-4(ju91)–4Pmkk-4 mkk-4::GFP (pCZ595)rpm-1(ju44); mkk-4(ju91)+1PF25B3.3 mkk-4(+) (pCZ691)rpm-1(ju44); mkk-4(ju91)+3Punc-25 mkk-4(+) (pCZ679)eSee Supplemental Figure S5 for quantitation.rpm-1(ju44); mkk-4(ju91)+3Poperon pmk-3(+) (pCZ597)pmk-3(ok169); rpm-1(ju44)+4Poperon pmk-3::GFP (pCZ598)pmk-3(ok169); rpm-1(ju44)+3PF25B3.3 pmk-3(+) (pCZ600)pmk-3(ju485); rpm-1(ju44)+5PF25B3.3 pmk-3(+) (pCZ600)pmk-3(ok169); rpm-1(ju44)+3Punc-25 pmk-3(+) (pCZ692)eSee Supplemental Figure S5 for quantitation.pmk-3(ok169); rpm-1(ju44)+5Pmyo-3 pmk-3(+) (pCZ602)eSee Supplemental Figure S5 for quantitation.pmk-3(ok169); rpm-1(ju44)–4PF25B3.3 dlk-1(+) (pCZ680)cInjected at 5–10 ng/µl DNA concentration.wtNAdThese transgenic worms show abnormal SNB-1::GFP puncta.3Pmkk-4 mkk-4(+) (pCZ594)cInjected at 5–10 ng/µl DNA concentration.wtNAdThese transgenic worms show abnormal SNB-1::GFP puncta.7Pmkk-4 mkk-4(DD) (pCZ596)cInjected at 5–10 ng/µl DNA concentration.wtNAdThese transgenic worms show abnormal SNB-1::GFP puncta.4Punc-25 mkk-4(+) (pCZ679)cInjected at 5–10 ng/µl DNA concentration.wtNAdThese transgenic worms show abnormal SNB-1::GFP puncta.1a Rescue activity was scored by observing Punc-25 SNB-1::GFP (juIs1). +, rescue; –, no rescue.b Injected at 5–50 pg/µl DNA concentration.c Injected at 5–10 ng/µl DNA concentration.d These transgenic worms show abnormal SNB-1::GFP puncta.e See Supplemental Figure S5 for quantitation. Open table in a new tab The C. elegans genome encodes close relatives of each of these three kinases (Supplemental Figure S3). To address the specificity of the suppression of rpm-1 by mutations in the three kinases, we tested mutations in all closely related MAP kinases, including the MKK3/6 ortholog SEK-1 and the MKK7 ortholog JKK-1, for their ability to suppress rpm-1(lf). rpm-1 phenotypes were not affected by mutations in these other MAP kinases (Supplemental Table S1). We assessed the gross anatomy of the nervous system in animals carrying each kinase suppressor mutation in a rpm-1(+) background, using GFP reporter genes and electron microscopy. The position and morphology of most neurons were normal in the kinase mutants (data not shown). We examined synaptic integrity in these animals by immunostaining for the synaptic vesicle protein SNT-1/synaptotagmin (Nonet et al., 1993Nonet M.L. Grundahl K. Meyer B.J. Rand J.B. Synaptic function is impaired but not eliminated in C. elegans mutants lacking synaptotagmin.Cell. 1993; 73: 1291-1305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) or the active zone protein UNC-10/Rim (Koushika et al., 2001Koushika S.P. Richmond J.E. Hadwiger G. Weimer R.M. Jorgensen E.M. Nonet M.L. A post-docking role for active zone protein Rim.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We found no difference between the suppressor mutants and the wild-type (Figures 2A, 2B, 2G, and 2H ). In rpm-1 mutants, there were gaps in the distribution of SNT-1 and UNC-10 along the nerve cords (Figures 2C and 2D). These defects were suppressed in sup; rpm-1 double mutants (Figures 2E and 2F). To determine the degree of suppression of synaptic morphology, we quantified the distribution of Punc-25 SNB-1::GFP. In wild-type animals, each SNB-1::GFP punctum represents a single presynaptic terminal of a GABAergic neuromuscular junction (Jorgensen et al., 1995Jorgensen E.M. Hartwieg E. Schuske K. Nonet M.L. Jin Y. Horvitz H.R. Defective recycling of synaptic vesicles in synaptotagmin mutants of Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 1995; 378: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We counted the total number of SNB-1::GFP puncta and the fraction of abnormally shaped puncta (Figures 1L and 1M). Wild-type dorsal nerve cords contain 159 ± 10 SNB-1::GFP puncta. In rpm-1 mutants, the number of SNB-1::GFP puncta was reduced to 87 ± 7. In rpm-1; sup double mutants, the number of SNB-1::GFP puncta was significantly increased relative to rpm-1; the morphology of puncta was also improved (Figure 1M). Suppressor mutants alone had numbers of SNB-1::GFP puncta similar to the wild-type. By this quantitative assay, we noticed that most suppressor mutations acted as semidominant suppressors of the rpm-1 SNB-1::GFP puncta phenotypes (Figures 1G, 1H, 1L, and 1M). Because the suppressor mutations cause loss of function, this semidominant behavior implies that, in the absence of RPM-1, MAP kinase activity becomes limiting in synapse formation. While performing transformation experiments, we noticed that transgenes expressing the wild-type kinase genes caused a range of neuronal phenotypes in a concentration-dependent manner (Table 1). At concentrations slightly above that required for rescue of the sup phenotype, wild-type kinase transgenes caused altered synaptic morphology (Figures 2I and 2J). At still higher concentrations, the transgenic animals displayed aberrant locomotion and in severe cases were paralyzed and small (Figure 4). The effects of such transgenes were exacerbated in an rpm-1(lf) background (Figure 6K; data not shown). These effects were also seen with transgenes that expressed a constitutively active form of MKK-4, in which the catalytically active Ser222 and Thr226 were mutated to Asp (mkk-4[DD]), but not with mkk-4(K95R) transgenes that expressed a kinase-dead MKK-4 (Figure 4B, Table 1). These observations show that synaptic morphology and function is sensitive to both the expression level and the activity of the kinases. Presynaptic defects in these transgenic animals showed striking resemblance to those of rpm-1(lf) mutants. Animals overexpressing mkk-4(++) showed discontinuous expression of SNT-1 or UNC-10 along the nerve cords, resembling rpm-1(lf) animals (Figures 2C, 2D, 2I, and 2J). To compare the effects of activated MAP kinase signaling to those of loss of rpm-1 function at individual synapses, we performed ultrastructural analysis of mkk-4(++) transgenic animals. C. elegans presynaptic terminals are at varicosities of neuronal processes, containing a cluster of synaptic vesicles (SVs) surrounding a single presynaptic specialization (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode C. elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314B: 1-340Crossref Google Scholar). We analyzed neuromuscular junctions from micrographs of serial sections of ventral and dorsal nerve cords. These synaptic regions contain both inhibitory (GABAergic) and excitatory (cholinergic) neuromuscular junctions, distinguishable by connectivity (see Experimental Procedures). In wild-type animals, both types of NMJ contained a single presynaptic density surrounded by a cluster of SVs (Figure 3A ); GABAergic NMJs have more than twice as many SVs as do cholinergic NMJs (Figure 3F). In rpm-1 mutants and in mkk-4(++) animals, the number of SVs per NMJ and per section were reduced in both types of NMJ (Figures 3F and 3G). Moreover, in rpm-1 mutants, synaptic structure was variably disorganized such that some presynaptic densities lacked SVs (Figure 3B), whereas other SV clusters contained several presynaptic densities (Figure 3D) (Zhen et al., 2000Zhen M. Huang X. Bamber B. Jin Y. Regulation of presynaptic terminal organization by C. elegans RPM-1, a putative guanine nucleotide exchanger with a RING-H2 finger domain.Neuron. 2000; 26: 331-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The range of presynaptic architecture in mkk-4(++) transgenic animals was indistinguishable from rpm-1(lf) (Figures 3C and 3E–3G). The presence of multiple presynaptic densities per synapse resulted in an increase in the total density length per synapse in rpm-1 and mkk-4(++) compared to wild-type (Figure 3H). The ratio of SVs per unit presynaptic density was reduced at GABAergic NMJs in both rpm-1 and mkk-4(++) animals (Figure 3I), reflecting both reduction in SV number and an increase in presynaptic density length per synapse. This ratio is less abnormal at cholinergic NMJs, suggesting that the requirement for RPM-1/MAP kinase regulation may vary depending on the synapse type. In summary, excessive activation of the MAP kinase pathway and loss of function of RPM-1 both disrupt presynaptic organization in the same way. We also examined mkk-4(ju91) loss of function mutants. Although the synaptic pattern in mkk-4(ju91) was not noticeably abnormal at the light microscope level (Figure 1, Figure 2), the number of SVs contacting the plasma membrane was significantly increased (Figures 3J, 3K, and 3M). Thus, activity of the MAP kinase cascade is required for normal synaptic vesicle distribution at the presynaptic terminal. The genetic interaction between mutations in the three kinases and rpm-1 suggested that the three kinases function in a common pathway. To test whether these three kinases function in a linear pathway at synapses, we first constructed triple mutant strains containing mutations in any two kinases together with rpm-1(lf), e.g., dlk-1(ju476); mkk-4(ju91); rpm-1(ju44). All pairwise combinations of mutations of the three kinases showed the same degree of suppression of rpm-1, as did mutations in individual kinases (Figure 4G ), consistent with these kinases acting in the same pathway. We addressed the order of function of the three kinases by genetic epistasis analysis using the gain-of-function phenotype caused by transgenes expressing either high levels of wild-type MKK-4, juEx490[mkk-4(++)], or the constitutively activated MKK-4, juEx669[mkk-4(DD)] (Figures 4A, 4B, and 4H). We constructed strains containing these transgenes in combination with dlk-1 or pmk-3 mutations. We found that a dlk-1(lf) mutation suppressed the gain-of-function effects caused by the mkk-4(++) transgene but not those caused by the mkk-4(DD) transgene (Figures 4C, 4D, and 4H). These results indicate that DLK-1 is required to activate wild-type MKK-4 but not constitutively active MKK-4(DD). In contrast, a pmk-3(lf) mutation suppressed the effects of both mkk-4(++) and of mkk-4(DD) transgenes (Figures 4E, 4F, and 4H), consistent with pmk-3 functioning downstream of mkk-4 and dlk-1. The effects of dlk-1 overexpression in neurons were suppressed by mutations in mkk-4 and pmk-3 (Figure 4H). These epistasis tests provide in vivo evidence that these three kinases form a linear pathway, with DLK-1 as the upstream MAPKKK and PMK-3 as the downstream MAP kinase. rpm-1 functions in presynaptic neurons (Zhen et al., 2000Zhen M.

To address in which cells the MAP kinase pathway interacts with rpm-1, we examined the expression of the three kinases using functional GFP-tagged transgenes. All transgenes were expressed at levels that rescued the suppression of rpm-1 phenotypes by the respective mapk(lf) mutation but which did not cause abnormalities in wild-type animals (Table 1). PMK-3::GFP and MKK-4::GFP were expressed in many neuron"
https://openalex.org/W2038431416,"Electrical activity in neurons is generally initiated in dendritic processes then propagated along axons to synapses, where it is passed to other neurons. Major structural features of neurons-their dendrites and axons-are thus related to their fundamental functions: the receipt and transmission of information. The acquisition of these distinct properties by dendrites and axons, called polarization, is a critical step in neuronal differentiation. We show here that SAD-A and SAD-B, mammalian orthologs of a kinase needed for presynaptic differentiation in Caenorhabditis elegans, are required for neuronal polarization. These kinases will provide entry points for unraveling signaling mechanisms that polarize neurons."

A cardinal sign of corneal injury or infection is the recruitment of leukocytes and formation of lipid and protein mediators that initiate and/or amplify inflammation and neovascularization (4Bazan N.G.

However, aberrant activation of these circuits can lead to sight-destroying inflammation and, thus, has been a main focus of research efforts. A striking feature of the avascular cornea is that it is largely devoid of immunogenic-inflammatory responses. Moreover, soluble factors from the aqueous humor appear to actively suppress leukocyte activation (7Streilein J.W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 8Hamrah P. Huq S.O. Liu Y. Zhang Q. Dana M.R. J.

No clinical therapies are currently available that selectively target inflammation or promote wound healing in the cornea. More importantly, use of anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids for corneal inflammation is restricted by serious side effects, including cataract formation, glaucoma, activation of latent herpes simplex, and delayed wound healing (16Fraunfelder F.T. Fraunfelder F.W. Drug-induced Ocular Side Effects, 5th Ed. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston, MA2001Google Scholar). Lipoxygenase (LOX)-initiated lipid mediator pathways are important regulators of innate immunity and inflammation, since they can activate both pro- and anti-inflammatory signals (3Lawrence T.

Recent studies have demonstrated that human pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Toxoplasma gondii can exploit these pathways to suppress host immune responses by expressing a functional 15-LOX and inducing LXA4 formation (21Aliberti J.

The human and murine 12/15-LOX pathways are of particular interest, since they are key enzymes in the formation of a distinct class of eicosanoids, the lipoxins, which are autacoids generated during inflammation and heterotypic cell-cell interactions. Lipoxin A4 exhibits potent anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and, in animal models of acute or aberrant inflammation, by inhibiting PMN (18McMahon B. Mitchell S. Brady H.R. Godson C.

In this regard, LXA4 has been implicated as an important component of the endogenous counterregulatory signals that promote resolution of inflammation and limit PMN-mediated tissue injury (3Lawrence T. Willoughby D.A. Gilroy D.W. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 18McMahon B. Mitchell S. Brady H.R. Godson C. Trends Pharmacol.

This conclusion has been further substantiated by recent studies with LXA4 receptor (ALX) transgenic mice, which demonstrate inhibition and accelerated resolution of inflammatory responses (26Levy B.D. De Sanctis G.T. Devchand P.R. Kim E. Ackerman K. Schmidt B.A. Szczeklik W. Drazen J.M. Serhan C.N. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1018-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 27Devchand P.R. Arita M.

The importance of mediators derived from essential polyun-saturated fatty acid is underscored by the well established role of ω-3 fatty acids in maintaining human health (28De Caterina R. Endres S.

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that consumption of fish oil-enriched diets containing eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) lowers the incidence of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (31Kromann N. Green A. Acta Med. Scand. 1980; 208: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6), in particular, is highly concentrated in photoreceptors, brain, and retinal synapses, and evidence suggests that it exerts anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects (28De Caterina R.

It is of interest that several reports provide evidence for a 15-LOX-like initiated pathway that gives rise to a DHA-derived mediator (35Marcheselli V.L. Hong S. Lukiw W.J. Tian X.H. Gronert K.

Although endogenous NPD-1 formation has been demonstrated in mouse brains, it remains to be determined whether this protective mediator can be generated in other tissues or organs. It is notable that corneal epithelia of several species express prominent 12/15-LOX activity (38Hurst J.S. Balazy M. Bazan H.E. Bazan N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6726-6730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Liminga M. Hornsten L. Sprecher H.W. Oliw E.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1210: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RNA expression of 15-LOX type 1 (ALOX15) and type 2 (ALOX15B) has been demonstrated in human corneal epithelial cells (40Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Duvoisin R.M. Engelhardt H. Wiedmann M. Nature. 1998; 395: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, no studies have identified a role for these enzymes in the cornea or investigated whether these pathways give rise to lipid autacoids that may regulate inflammatory or immunogenic responses in the cornea. To this end, we set out to determine whether anti-inflammatory lipid autacoids are formed in the cornea as part of an endogenous program to limit the sequelae of epithelial injury. Here, we report the endogenous formation of LXA4 and NPD1 in healthy and injured corneas and mRNA expression of a LXA4 pathway that correlates with epithelial wound healing. In addition, we provide evidence for a novel role of the mouse 12/15-LOX pathway in wound healing and demonstrate that treatment with LXA4 and NPD1 accelerates re-epithelialization without impairing PMN recruitment, a bioaction distinct from their documented leukocyte-selective properties. All animal studies were approved by the New York Medical College Vertebrate Animal Committee and were performed according to the guidelines of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology. Male BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks) were placed either on a standard rodent diet or on a custom diet (Research Diets, Inc.) that was based on either corn oil or fish oil (menhaden oil, ω-3) as a fat source. The AIN-76A diet is a standard low fat rodent diet that contains 20.8 kcal % protein, 67.7 kcal % carbohydrates, and 11.5 kcal % fat. The menhaden oil contains 2% arachidonic acid, 14% eicosapentaenoic acid, and 11% DHA and represents 90% of the fat in the ω-3 diet. The fish oil diet was kept at 4 °C in the dark and was replaced every 2 days, and animals were placed on the diet for 3–4 weeks prior to being subjected to corneal injury. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg) intramuscularly, and a drop of tetracaine-HCl 0.5% was applied to the eye to deliver local corneal anesthesia prior to subjecting animals to two separate models of corneal injuries. Thermal Injury—Corneas were cauterized by drawing a vertical line (∼1–2 mm) across the cornea with a heated microprobe under a slit lamp biomicroscope. This method results in a significant and consistent injury, namely a 1–2-mm burn that was restricted to the anterior corneal surface. Wound size and degree of injury were determined by slit lamp biomicroscopy and documented for quantitation and analysis by a CCD camera (MicroPublisher, QImaging). Epithelial Removal—The corneal epithelium up to the corneal/limbal border was removed using an Algerbrush II with a 0.5-mm corneal rust ring remover under the slit lamp biomicroscope. Corneas were stained with fluorescein as a direct marker of the epithelial defect, and the total area of the denuded cornea was quantitated by image software analyses. Mice were treated topically (1 eye drop; 10 μl) immediately after thermal injury or de-epithelialization with 0.01–1 μg of the indicated lipid autacoids in 100% sterile HBSS (pH 7.4); solutions for every treatment were prepared immediately prior to the application. Topical treatments were repeated three times daily for 24–96 h. LXA4 was purchased from Calbiochem, and 17S-HDHA and NPD1 were prepared by biogenic synthesis. LXA4 stable analog (ATLa, 15-epi-16-(para-fluorophenoxylipoxin A4-methyl ester) was kindly provided by Drs. John F. Parkinson and William J. Guilford at Berlex Bioscience. 12/15-LOX (Alox15)-deficient mice (6 weeks, female) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). These mice are a Jax®Gemm® Strain with a targeted mutation in the 15-LOX (Alox15tm1Fun) that is in a background C57BL/6J inbreed strain. They are well characterized (43Klein R.F. Allard J. Avnur Z.

Age- and gender-matched congenic C57BL/6J stock 000664 mice (6 weeks, female) were used as controls as suggested by Jackson Laboratory. Mice were anesthetized, and corneas were subjectively assessed 24, 48, 72, and/or 96 h after injury for cloudiness, opacity, and neovascularization as markers of inflammation by slit lamp biomicroscopy, as previously cited (6Conners M.S.

Eyes of anesthetized mice were stained with fluorescein, and images of the anterior surface were taken with a CCD camera attached to the slit lamp biomicroscope to quantitate wound closure and re-epithelialization. Digital images were analyzed, and the fluorescein-stained wound area was quantitated using image software analyses (Adobe Photoshop, San Jose, CA). PMN were quantitated in dissected and cleaned corneas at the indicated time points by measuring myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) as a specific PMN marker (25Levy B.D. Clish C.B. Schmidt B. Gronert K.

In brief, tissues were homogenized in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, followed by three cycles of sonication and freeze-thaw. The particulate matter was removed by centrifugation, and MPO activity in the supernatant was measured by spectrophotometry using o-dianisidine dihydrochloride reduction as a colorimetric indicator. Calibration curves for conversion of MPO activities to PMN number were established with PMN that were collected from zymosan A-induced peritonitis in BALB/c mice. Corneas were dissected from eyes using sterile instruments and were cleaned in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (4 °C) under a dissecting microscope to remove all noncorneal tissue. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and RNA integrity was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantitated by spectrophotometry. Specific primers were designed based on published mRNA sequences (PubMed, GenBank™) to amplify the mouse lipoxin receptor ALX as previously described (47Takano T. Fiore S. Maddox J.F. Brady H.R.

Two PCR amplifications were carried as controls for each primer pair and corneal RNA sample to confirm specific amplification: 1) without the RNA template and 2) without reverse transcription. RT-PCR analysis was performed with the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and a Gradient thermal cycler (PTC-200; MJ Research).

In brief, analysis was performed with an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a diode array detector, a binary pump, a membrane degasser, a heated column compartment, and a microflow cell. Samples were injected in mobile phase and eluted on a Luna C18–2 microbore column (1 × 100 mm, 5 μm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) or a Beckman Coulter Ultrasphere column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm; Phenomenex) using two separate gradient mobile phase systems that consisted of methanol/acetonitrile/water/acetate (24:27:49:1, v/v/v/v, pH 5.6) or methanol/water/acetate (65:35:0.01, v/v/v) run isocratically for 25 min and followed by a 25-min linear gradient to 99:1 or 99.99:0.01 (v/v, methanol/acetate), respectively. Collected UV data were recalled at 205, 236, 270, 245, 280, and 301 nm and analyzed by LC 3D ChemStation software (Agilent Technologies). Calibration curves were established for each compound, and peak areas were integrated for quantitation. GC/MS analysis was performed as in Ref. 46Serhan C.N. Hong S. Gronert K. Colgan S.P.

The helium flow rate was 1.5 ml/min, and the initial temperature was 150 °C, followed by 230 °C (2 min) and 280 °C (10 min). For selected samples, HPLC fractions that correspond to established retention times of authentic standards were collected and derivatized to generate pentafluorobenzyl esters and trimethylsilyl ether derivatives, and 10–1000 pg were injected in 2 μl of iso-octane for GC/MS analysis. For endogenous product analysis, corneas from healthy or injured eyes were dissected in cold HBSS buffer without calcium or magnesium, cleaned under a dissecting microscope to remove all noncorneal tissue, and either immediately placed in 100% MeOH (injured corneas) or in HBSS buffer (pH 7.4, 37 °C) containing 1.2 mm Ca2+. Uninjured corneas in buffer were incubated in the dark (37 °C, 30 min) in the presence of a calcium ionophore (A23187; 5 μm). Prostaglandin B2 (50 ng) was added to samples as an internal standard for recovery, and corneas were gently homogenized at 4 °C and extracted as previously detailed (53Gronert K. Clish C.B. Romano M. Serhan C.N. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 120: 119-144PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, homogenized corneal suspensions were placed at -20 °C for at least 30 min and centrifuged, and supernatants were collected. Supernatants were diluted with 10 volumes of HPLC grade water and acidified to pH 4.0 with HCl (1 n). Acidified samples were immediately loaded onto primed C18-ODS cartridges (AccuBond II; 500 mg; Agilent Technologies). Cartridges were washed with 10 ml of HPLC grade water followed by hexane, and compounds were eluted in methyl formate followed by a final elution in methanol. Methyl formate fractions were taken to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen, resuspended in MeOH (100 μl), and stored at -80 °C. To quantitate formation of lipid autacoids, extracted samples in methanol (methyl formate fractions) were taken to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen, resuspended in ELISA buffer, and immediately analyzed by specific ELISAs for LXA4 (54Levy B.D.

Neither growth promotion nor stimulation of the two enzymes requires heterotrimeric G proteins. P. indica also stimulates the expression of the uidA gene under the control of the Arabidopsis nitrate reductase (Nia2) promoter in transgenic tobacco seedlings. At least two regions (–470/–439 and –103/–89) are important for Nia2 promoter activity in tobacco roots. One of the regions contains an element, ATGATAGATAAT, that binds to a homeodomain transcription factor in vitro. The message for this transcription factor is up-regulated by P. indica. The transcription factor also binds to a CTGATAGATCT segment in the SEX1 promoter in vitro. We propose that the growth-promoting effect initiated by P. indica is accompanied by a co-regulated stimulation of enzymes involved in nitrate and starch metabolisms.

We propose that the growth-promoting effect initiated by P. indica is accompanied by a co-regulated stimulation of enzymes involved in nitrate and starch metabolisms. Often nitrogen is the limiting source for plant growth and development. It is recruited by plants either as nitrate or ammonium or for a few species by nitrogen fixation with the help of rhizobia (1Esseling J.J. Emons A.M. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 2004; 214: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 2Gage D.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 280-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Mycorrhizal fungi also play an important role in delivering either nitrate or ammonium to the root cells. It is believed that mycorrhizal fungi preferentially recruit ammonium rather than nitrate from the soil and that amino acids represent the major compounds that serve to transfer nitrogen to the host plant (cf. Refs. 3Boukcim H. Plassard C. J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 160: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar and 4Guescini M. Pierleoni R. Palma F. Zeppa S. Vallorani L. Potenza L. Sacconi C.

We studied Piriformospora indica, an endophytic fungus of the Sebacinaceae family, which colonizes the roots of a wide variety of plant species and promotes their growth (5Kumari R. Yadav H.K.

Microbiol. 1999; 65: 2741-2744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of the endophytic fungus with plant roots is accompanied by an enormous requisition of nitrogen from the environment. By analyzing the interaction of P. indica with Arabidopsis and tobacco roots we found that in contrast to mycorrhizal associations, nitrate reduction in the roots is stimulated by P. indica. A homeodomain transcription factor responds to the fungus and binds to promoter regions of the P. indica-responsive Nia2, SEX1, and 2-nitropropane dioxygenase genes. These results suggest that the expression of P. indica-responsive target genes may be controlled by common regulatory elements and trans-factors. Transgenic Tobacco—Transgenic seeds of Nicotiana tabacum L., var. Samsun NN were obtained from greenhouse-grown plants (6Peškan-Berghöfer T. Markert C. Varma A. Oelmüller R. Physiol. Plant. 2004; 122: 465-477Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). They were sterilized and germinated on Murashige-Skoog medium (11Murashige T. Skoog F. Plant Physiol. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (52758) Google Scholar) supplemented with 2% (w/v) sucrose and 0.8% (w/v) agar in temperature-controlled (25 °C) growth chambers under a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle. 80 μg of ml–1 (w/v) kanamycin was added to the medium. Four-week-old plantlets were transferred to soil to obtain seeds for the physiological experiments. The antisense lines for the heterotrimeric G protein subunit β were described previously (12Peškan-Berghöfer T. Neuwirth J. Kusnetsov V. Oelmüller R. Planta. 2005; 5: 737-746Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Growth Conditions of Plant and Fungus—For physiological experiments in Petri dishes, transgenic or wild-type tobacco or Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized and placed on Petri dishes containing Murashige and Skoog (11Murashige T. Skoog F. Plant Physiol. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (52758) Google Scholar) nutrient medium. After cold treatment at 4 °C for 48 h, plates were incubated for 10 days (Arabidopsis thaliana) or 14 days (Nicotiana tabacum) at 22 °C under continuous illumination (100 μmol m–2 sec–1 photosynthetic active radiation). P. indica, a cultivable plant growth-promoting root endophyte (10Varma A. Verma S. Sudha Sahay N.S. Butehorn B. Franken P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 2741-2744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Pisolithus tinctorius were cultured as described previously (6Peškan-Berghöfer T. Markert C. Varma A. Oelmüller R. Physiol.

Co-cultivation Experiments, Determination of Fresh and Dry Weight, Protein Content, and Nitrate Uptake—14-day-old tobacco (or 10-day-old Arabidopsis) seedlings were transferred to nylon disks (mesh size 70 μm) and placed on top of a modified MMN 1The abbreviations used are: MMN, Marx-Melin-Norkrans; RT, reverse transcription; NR, nitrate reductase; MS-MS, tandem mass spectrometry; Gβ, β-subunit of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins; GUS, β-glucuromidase. culture medium (MMN1/10 medium with a 1/10 ratio of nitrogen and phosphorus and no carbohydrate) (14Marx D.H. Phytopathology. 1969; 59: 153-163Google Scholar) in 90-mm Petri dishes. After 24 h, fungal plugs of 5 mm in diameter were placed at a distance of 1 cm from the roots. Plates were incubated at 22 °C under continuous illumination from the side (maximum 80 μmol m–2 s–1 photosynthetic active radiation). Root length was measured with a ruler. The fresh weight of the roots and aerial parts was determined directly. Proteins were extracted into a 5-ml extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS), precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and the protein concentration was determined according to Lowry. Dry weight of the roots and aerial parts was determined after incubation of the tissue at 105 °C for 16 h. For pot experiments, 9-day-old sterile tobacco seedlings were transferred to sterile soil in pots (25-cm diameter). Aliquots of the soil were mixed with 1% (w/v) fungus and put into preformed holes surrounding the roots of the seedling. Growth was followed in temperature-controlled (25 °C) growth chambers under a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle. Analysis of the Nia2 Promoter—Some transgenic tobacco lines harboring Nia2-promoter::uidA gene fusions were described previously (15Sherameti I. Sopory S.K. Trebicka A. Pfannschmidt T. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46594-46600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For the analyses performed here, the Nia2 5′-upstream region –1088/–1 (relative to the ATG start codon) of At1g37130 was fused to the uidA reporter gene. Manipulations of the –1088/–1 fragment occurred in pBSC+ (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). Starting from the –1088/–1 Nia2 fragment in pBSC+, 5′-deletions were obtained with exonuclease III digestions. After religation, the clones were sequenced. Further analyses were performed with the following fragments: –1088/–1, –650/–1, –628/–1, –470/–1, –438/–1, –361/–1, –310/–1, –111/–1, and –89/–1. Although seeds from all plants were analyzed in parallel, only those plants that gave important information for this study are mentioned under “Results.” Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to Mikaelian and Sergeant (16Mikaelian I. Sergeant A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 193-202PubMed Google Scholar) and specified in Ref. 17Flieger K. Tyagi A. Sopory S. Cseplo A. Hermann R.G. Oelmüller R. Plant J. 1993; 4: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar. The 5′-end of the promoter segment, obtained after PCR with genomic DNA from A. thaliana, ecotype Landsberg, was located toward the 3′-end of the vector. The mutagenized DNA was obtained by three successive PCRs. An oligonucleotide with the mutagenized region and 12 authentic nucleotides on each side and the T7 primer were used for the first reaction. The second reaction was performed with the T3 primer and an oligonucleotide (5′-AAAAAACCGCTCTAGAACTAGTG-3′), which primes 20 bp 3′ of the T7 primer. This oligonucleotide contains a 5′-mismatched end (cf. Ref. 16Mikaelian I. Sergeant A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 193-202PubMed Google Scholar). The amplified fragments were purified on agarose gels, and 10 ng of each of them was used for the third PCR reaction with the T3 and T7 primers. The final products were ligated into pBSC+ and sequenced before transfer to pBI101 (18Jefferson R.A. Burgess S.M. Hirsh D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 893: 8447-8451Crossref Scopus (816) Google Scholar) as BamHI/SalI fragments. After triparental mating (19Bevan M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8711-8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar) and plant transformation, 20 independent lines per construct were generated. For physiological experiments with the seeds of the F1 generation, detailed analyses were performed only for those constructs relevant for this study. The transcription start site of the Nia2 promoter was determined with Arabidopsis root RNA and primer extension analysis. For GUS staining, seedlings were harvested and immediately put into 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-glucopyranoside (X-Glc) solution (50 mg of X-Glc, 1 ml of dimethylformamide, 4.9 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 250 μl of Me2SO, 500 μl of potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) (100 mm), 500 μl of potassium hexacyanoferrate (II) (100 mm)) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After washing with water, the seedlings were incubated in 70% ethanol and stored at 4 °C. For GUS staining of root hairs, seeds were germinated and seedlings were grown in liquid Murashige and Skoog medium to avoid hair damage. RNA Preparation and Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA from root material was isolated with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RT-PCR analysis was performed by reverse transcription of 5 μg of total RNA with gene-specific reverse primers (see below). First strand synthesis was performed with a kit (K1631) from MBI Fermentas (St. Leon-Roth, Germany). After 20 PCR cycles, the products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide; visualized bands were quantified with the Image Master Video System (Amersham Biosciences). For Northern analysis, gene-specific primers were designed to amplify four DNA fragments from our cDNA library (20Sherameti I. Shahollari B. Landsberger M. Westermann M. Cherepneva G. Kusnetsov V. Oelmüller R. Plant J. 2004; 38: 578-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar): Nia2 (At1g37130), SEX1 (At1g10760), and the genes for the homeodomain transcription factor (At2g35940) and for 2-nitropropane dioxygenase (At5g64250). The primers were designed such that they amplified the entire coding region including 4 nucleotides up- and downstream of the genes. Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Gel mobility assays were performed with a fraction enriched in root nuclei proteins from A. thaliana. Approximately 10 g of Arabidopsis roots was used to isolate a fraction enriched in nuclei (21Oelmüller R. Bolle C. Tyagi A.K. Niekrawietz N. Breit S. Herrmann R.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The extracted proteins were further purified on heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) columns. After elution with 700 mm KCl, the protein fraction was dialyzed against NEB buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and concentrated using spin columns (Amicon, Witten, Germany). These protein factions were used for gel mobility shift assays and the filter binding assay. Five pairs of oligonucleotides (Nia2-a, ATGATAGATAAT, Nia2-b, ATTATCTATCAT; Nia2mu-a, ATGATGCATAAT; Nia2mu-b, ATTATGCATCAT; SEX1-a, CTGATAGATCT; SEX1-b, AGATCTATCAG; SEX1mu-a, CTGATGCATCT; SEX1mu-b, AGATGCATCAG; NpdO-a, AGGATCGATGA; NpdO-b, TCATCGATCCT) were annealed and cloned into the SmaI site of pBSC+. After restriction of the recombinant plasmid DNA with EcoRI and XbaI, the recessive ends were filled in with Klenow enzyme and radiolabeled nucleotides, and the insert was isolated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For the filter binding assay, the fragments were excised from the plasmid with XbaI and EcoRI and purified on polyacrylamide gels (5%). Enzyme Assays—The nitrate reductase (NR) and GUS assays were described earlier (15Sherameti I. Sopory S.K. Trebicka A. Pfannschmidt T. Oelmüller R. J. Biol.

Mass Spectrometry—Proteins extracted from membrane fractions were further purified by two rounds of methanol precipitation before digestion with trypsin (6Peškan-Berghöfer T. Markert C. Varma A. Oelmüller R. Physiol. Plant. 2004; 122: 465-477Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Alternatively, silver-stained gel spots from the gels were excised and the proteins extracted into 500 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate supplemented with 60 ng/μl trypsin. After lyophilization, the pellet was resuspended in 5 μl of water/acetonitrile/formic acid (95:5:0.1) prior to liquid chromatography-MS analysis. Peptide analyses, analyte sampling, chromatography, and acquisition of data were performed on a LC (Famos-Ultimate; LC-Packings) coupled with an LCQ Deca XP ion trap mass spectrometer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The measured MS-MS spectra were matched with the amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides from the A. thaliana data base in FASTA format. Cys modification by carbamidomethylation (+57 Da) was taken into account, and known contaminants were filtered out. Raw MS-MS data were analyzed by the Finnigan Sequest/Turbo Sequest software (revision 3.0; ThermoQuest, San Jose, CA). The parameters for the analysis by the Sequest algorithm were set according to Stauber et al. (22Stauber E.J. Fink A. Markert C. Kruse O. Johanningmeier U. Hippler M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 978-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The similarity between the measured MS-MS spectrum and the theoretical MS-MS spectrum, reported as the cross-correlation factor (xcorr) was above 2.95 and 3.85 for doubly or triply charged precursor ions, respectively. To identify corresponding loci, identified protein sequences were subjected to BLAST search at NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and FASTA searches by using the AGI protein data base at The Arabidopsis Information Resource (www.arabidopsis.org/). Macroarray Analyses—RNA was isolated from Arabidopsis roots 2 and 5 days after co-cultivation with P. indica. The macroarray filters used for the hybridization and the hybridization conditions have been described previously (23Chen I.P. Haehnel U. Altschmied L. Schubert I. Puchta H. Plant J. 2003; 35: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Genes identified in these studies and those that responded to P. indica were further analyzed in separate RT-PCR studies. Only those genes that are relevant for this study are mentioned here. Miscellaneous—DNA extraction was performed according to standard protocols (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Western analyses with polyclonal antibodies raised against nitrate reductase (gift from Dr. K.-J. Appenroth) and the β-subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins from tobacco (25Peškan T. Oelmüller R. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were performed according to Stöckel and Oelmüller (26Stöckel J. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10243-10251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed with the buffer system from Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 275-280Crossref Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Determination of total nitrogen was performed with Kjeldahl equipment and protocols provided by “behr Labor-Technik” (Düsseldorf, Germany). Roots of control and inoculated plants were stained with cotton (blue) before examination under the light microscope (Zeiss Axioplan model MC 100). Co-cultivation of Tobacco Seedlings with P. indica—14-Day-old tobacco seedlings were transferred to MMN1/10 medium and inoculated with P. indica. The fungal inoculum was placed 1 cm away from the roots. MMN1/10 medium was chosen because it contains low concentrations of phosphate and nitrate and no carbon source, conditions known to promote the interaction between plants and symbiotic fungi. The fungus grew slowly on the co-cultivation medium and produced only a few spores. A difference in root growth was not observed within the first 2 days of co-cultivation. After 5 days, a stimulatory effect of P. indica on root growth became visible. After 7 days, the inoculated seedlings were significantly larger and heavier when compared with control seedlings, and after 10 days the size of the tobacco seedlings was substantially larger (cf. Fig. 1A, a and b, cf. also B–D). We also inoculated plants with the ectomycobiont P. tinctorius because it was shown that hypaphorine, a major indolic compound from this fungus, has an impact on Arabidopsis root growth (28Reboutier D. Bianchi M. Brault M. Roux C. Dauphin A. Rona J.P. Legue V. Lapeyrie F. Bouteau F. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2002; 15: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, seedlings inoculated with P. tinctorius did not differ from the uninoculated controls (Fig. 1A, c–f). The stimulatory effect of P. indica on the growth of tobacco was still detectable 6 weeks after transfer of the seedlings to soil, and inoculated plants were much bigger compared with their controls (Fig. 1E). This is not surprising considering the extensive colonization of the outer cell layers of the roots by the fungal hyphae (Fig. 1, F and G). After the initial lateral growth (Fig. 1F), the fungus produced spores, which could be detected in almost all outer root cells (Fig. 1G). It can be concluded that under the given conditions, growth of tobacco seedlings is substantially stimulated by P. indica, similar to previous observations with A. thaliana seedlings 2Oelmüller, R., Peškan-Berghöfer, T., Shallohari, B., Trebicka, A., Sherameti, I., and Varma, A. (2005) Physiol. Plant. 124, 152–166. (6Peškan-Berghöfer T. Markert C. Varma A. Oelmüller R. Physiol. Plant. 2004; 122: 465-477Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 30Oelmüller R. Shahollari B.

Plant Physiol. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). P. indica Stimulates Nitrate Uptake and Nitrate Reductase Gene Expression—After 10 days of co-cultivation with P. indica the fresh weight of the aerial parts of the tobacco seedlings was enhanced by 42.2 ± 3.8%, the dry weight by 41.0 ± 4.0%, and the total protein content by 42.2 ± 3.1% (n = 480 seedlings). This was accompanied by substantial recruitment of nitrogen from the agar medium. Based on equal amounts of fresh weight, the nitrogen content in the aerial parts of the seedlings increased by 21.4 ± 4.4%. Thus, considering the larger size of the cotyledons, ∼60% more nitrogen must have been transferred from the medium to the aerial parts of the seedlings. This prompted us to investigate the effect of P. indica on nitrate assimilation in more detail. We focused on seedlings grown on agar because quantitative analyses were much easier when compared with adult plants grown on soil. Co-cultivation of tobacco seedlings with P. indica causes a 50.2 ± 4.2% increase in the plant-specific NADH-dependent NR activity in the roots. Western analysis with antibodies against plant NR confirmed that the higher NADH-dependent enzyme activity correlated with an increase in the amount of the root enzyme (Fig. 2). Equal loading of root protein extracts was confirmed with an antibody against the β-subunit of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (25Peškan T. Oelmüller R. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast to mycorrhizal symbioses, the endophytic fungus P. indica stimulates the assimilatory enzyme NR. The stimulatory effect of P. indica on NR is predominantly found in roots and to a much lesser extent in the shoots (12.2 ± 1.2%). Thus, the higher nitrogen level in the aerial parts of the seedlings after cocultivation with P. indica must be caused by more efficient nitrate assimilation in the roots. In principle, the same results were obtained for Arabidopsis seedlings except that the overall stimulation of NR activity in the roots was only 29.8 ± 3.1%. The Arabidopsis Nia2 5′-upstream region –1088/–1 (relative to the ATG codon, the transcription start site is located 88 nucleotides upstream of the ATG codon) fused to the β-glucuronidase gene (uidA) was introduced into Nicotiana. When co-cultivated with P. indica, a stimulatory effect can also be monitored at the level of transgene expression (Table I). Comparable with the results obtained for NR activity, P. indica stimulated uidA gene expression in tobacco roots by ∼50%. Again, a much lower stimulatory effect was observed in shoots (∼10–15%).Table IGUS activity in 24-day-old transgenic tobacco seedlings, grown in either the presence (+) or absence (-) of P. indicaGUS activity-1088/-1-470/-1-438/-1Mu-+-+-+-+nmol/g-1 min-1Shoot87.1 ± 4.1102.2 ± 4.189.2 ± 3.498.7 ± 4.189.5 ± 6.2107.3 ± 6.391.7 ± 3.9103.4 ± 5.1Root11.3 ± 0.221.3 ± 0.110.0 ± 0.220.1 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.28.9 ± 0.31.5 ± 0.18.3 ± 0.8 Open table in a new tab Deletions of the promoter from –1088 to –470 had no significant effect on uidA expression, whereas further deletion to –438 caused an ∼60% decrease in uidA expression in roots but not in shoots. Thus, the region –470/–439 appears to be important for the promoter activity in roots. Replacement of AG by GC in the ATGATAGATAAT sequence (–459/–448) within this region causes the same decrease in GUS activity as deletion from –470/–1 to –438/–1 (Table I). Furthermore, although the –111/–1 segment is active in roots and shoots, deletion to –89 completely abolishes the promoter activity. Thus, an additional crucial cis-element(s) for Nia2 expression appears to be located in the region between –111 and the transcription start site at position –88. Random site-directed mutagenesis in the latter region in the context of the –1088/–1 fragment followed by expression analysis in transgenic tobacco revealed that the two GT nucleotides directly upstream of the transcription start site and the CA nucleotides at position –97/–96 play a crucial role in the promoter activity in vivo because replacement of GT by AA and of CA by GC completely abolished gene expression. The close vicinity of the CA and GT motifs to the transcription start site makes it unlikely that this region functions as a TATA box element. Taken together, the –470/–439 and –97/–89 regions upstream of the ATG codon are essential for Nia2 promoter activity in transgenic tobacco. GUS staining revealed that the promoter was active in almost all of the living cells of the roots (Fig. 3). High GUS activity is found in the living cells of the vascular tissue. In the larger cells surrounding the vascular tissue, the stain is mainly detectable in the narrow cytoplasmic tubes attached to the plasma membrane. Most of the GUS staining was observed in the cytoplasm of the root hair (Fig. 3, upper panel, cf. also Ref. 15Sherameti I. Sopory S.K. Trebicka A. Pfannschmidt T. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46594-46600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Semiquantitative analysis revealed that the stimulatory effect of P. indica on uidA gene expression in the root hairs is at least 2-fold, i.e. significantly higher than the effect observed for the entire root (data not shown). When grown in the presence of P. indica, a significant stimulation of uidA expression in the roots was detected for all active fragments tested. However, the extent of the stimulatory effect in the roots declines dramatically when the promoter is deleted from –470 to –438 (Table I). Thus, in addition to its specific role for Nia2 promoter activity in roots, the –470/–439 region also functions as a P. indica-responsive element in the Nia2 promoter. A stimulatory effect in response to P. indica was still measurable for the –110/–1 promoter fragment (24 ± 2%), although to a lesser extent. Thus sequences within this segment in combination with or in addition to the P. indica-responsive element are involved in P. indica-mediated Nia2 expression. A fusion of the –470/–439-bp region to the –90-bp cauliflower mosaic virus minimal promoter did not respond to P. indica (data not shown). A double-stranded nucleotide from the –459/–448 segment ATGATAGATAAT shows a retarded band in gel mobility shift assays with nuclear extracts from Arabidopsis roots (Fig. 4). No retardation is detectable with the double-stranded mutant oligonucleotide ATGATGCATAAT. Furthermore, the binding can be competed with an excess of the original but not with mutant oligonucleotide (Fig. 4). These and other results (cf. below) indicate that root nuclei from Arabidopsis contain a protein(s), which binds to the P. indica-responsive element in the Nia2 promoter. The Nia2 Promoter Binds a Homeodomain Transcription Factor in Vitro, and the Message for the Transcription Factor Is Up-regulated in Response to P. indica—The Nia2 (and the mutant) double-stranded promoter segments were immobilized on nylon membranes. The membranes were then incubated with nuclear extract from Arabidopsis roots for ∼60 h at 6 °C under continuous shaking. The filters were washed five times with 90 mm NaCl (10 min each, first at 6 °C, then at 18 °C). Finally, DNA-bound proteins were solubilized by boiling the membranes in loading buffer, and the extracted proteins were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Two dominant protein bands of ∼75 and 160 kDa, which are not detectable in protein extracts from the control oligonucleotide (Fig. 5), can be eluted from the Nia2 oligonucleotide. The bands were extracted from the gel and analyzed by mass spectrometry after trypsin digestion. The lower band corresponds to the Arabidopsis fragments SLGEEDSVSGVGR and TSDETMMQPINADFSSNEK. Searches of the literature show that the upper band correspond to GSCGNDK and PVELGTAER. The four peptides are present in the homeodomain protein At2g35940. In the upper band, we could also identify peptides that correspond to other homeodomain transcription factors; however, the xcorr values were too low to allow conclusions. It appears that the upper band contains components of a larger, unresolved complex together with At2g35940 (cf. “Discussion”). Northern analyses uncovered that the message for At2g35940 is up-regulated in roots co-cultivated with P. indica (Fig. 6). Stimulation of the homeodomain protein mRNA level was observed before the Nia2 mRNA level increased. The Expression-relevant Upstream Region ATGATAGATAAT of the Nia2 Promoter Exhibits Sequence Similarities to a SEX1 Promoter Region for the Starch-degrading Enzyme Glucan-water Dikinase and to a Region in the 2-Nitropropane Dioxygenase (At5g64250) Promoter, and the Messages of All Three Genes Are Up-regu"
https://openalex.org/W2011081704,"Homeobox genes encode transcription factors notable for their ability to regulate embryogenesis. Here, we report the discovery of a cluster of 12 related homeobox genes on the X chromosome expressed in male and female reproductive tissues in adult mice. These reproductive homeobox on the X chromosome (Rhox) genes are expressed in a cell type-specific manner; several are hormonally regulated, and their expression pattern during postnatal testis development corresponds to their chromosomal position. Most of the Rhox genes are expressed in Sertoli cells, the nurse cells in direct contact with developing male germ cells, suggesting that they regulate the expression of somatic-cell gene products critical for germ cell development. In support of this, targeted disruption of Rhox5 increased male germ cell apoptosis and reduced sperm production, sperm motility, and fertility. Identification of this family of homeobox genes provides an opportunity to study colinear gene regulation and the transcriptional control of reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2045731233,"Several reversible inhibitors selective for human monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) that do not inhibit MAO A have been described in the literature. The following compounds: 8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine, 1,4-diphenyl-2-butene, and trans,trans-farnesol are shown to inhibit competitively human, horse, rat, and mouse MAO B with Ki values in the low micromolar range but are without effect on either bovine or sheep MAO B or human MAO A. In contrast, the reversible competitive inhibitor isatin binds to all known MAO B and MAO A with similar affinities. Sequence alignments and the crystal structures of human MAO B in complex with 1,4-diphenyl-2-butene or with trans,trans-farnesol provide molecular insights into these specificities. These inhibitors span the substrate and entrance cavities with the side chain of Ile-199 rotated out of its normal conformation suggesting that Ile-199 is gating the substrate cavity. Ile-199 is conserved in all known MAO B sequences except bovine MAO B, which has Phe in this position (the sequence of sheep MAO B is unknown). Phe is conserved in the analogous position in MAO A sequences. The human MAO B I199F mutant protein of MAO B binds to isatin (Ki = 3 μm) but not to the three inhibitors listed above. The crystal structure of this mutant demonstrates that the side chain of Phe-199 interferes with the binding of those compounds. This suggests that the Ile-199 “gate” is a determinant for the specificity of these MAO B inhibitors and provides a molecular basis for the development of MAO B-specific reversible inhibitors without interference with MAO A function in neurotransmitter metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2089784819,"Brassinosteroids are steroidal hormones essential for the growth and development of plants. Brassinolide, the most biologically active brassinosteroid, has a seven-membered lactone ring that is formed by a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of its immediate precursor castasterone. Despite its potential key role in controlling plant development, brassinolide synthase has not been identified. Previous work has shown that the formation of castasterone from 6-deoxocastasterone is catalyzed by members of the CYP85A family of cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases. A null mutation in the tomato Dwarf (CYP85A1) gene, extreme dwarf (dx), causes severe dwarfism due to brassinosteroid deficiency, but the dx mutant still produces fruits. Here, we show that dx fruits contain brassinolide at a higher level than wild-type fruits and that a new CYP85A gene, CYP85A3, is preferentially expressed in tomato fruits. Tomato CYP85A3 catalyzed the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation to produce brassinolide from castasterone in yeast, in addition to the conversion of 6-deoxocastasterone to castasterone. We also show that Arabidopsis CYP85A2, which was initially characterized as castasterone synthase, also has brassinolide synthase activity. Exogenous application of castasterone and brassinolide to the Arabidopsis cyp85a1/cyp85a2 double mutant suggests that castasterone can function as an active brassinosteroid but that its conversion into brassinolide is necessary for normal vegetative development in Arabidopsis. We postulate that castasterone is the major active brassinosteroid during vegetative growth in tomato, whereas brassinolide may play an organ-specific role in fruit development in this species.

Steroids act as hormones in various organisms. In animals, steroids are used as sex hormones, whereas ecdysteroids function as molting hormones in insects. Brassinosteroids (BRs) 1The abbreviations used are: BR, brassinosteroid; BL, brassinolide; P450, cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase; CS, castasterone; 6-deoxoCS, 6-deoxocastasterone; dx, extreme dwarf allele; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; WT, wild-type. are steroidal plant hormones that are critical for normal growth and development. Genetic evidence illustrates that BRs play a role in such diverse processes as stem elongation, leaf development, pollen tube growth, vascular differentiation, seed germination, photomorphogenesis, and stress tolerance (1Fujioka S. Yokota T. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 137-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 2Clouse S.D. Sasse J.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 427-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Among BRs, brassinolide (BL) (see Fig. 1A) is the most biologically active form. Following the discovery of BL as a growth-promoting steroid from rape pollen (3Grove M.D. Spencer G.F. Rohwedder W.K. Mandava N. Worley J.F. Warthen J.D. Steffens G.L. Anderson F.-J. Cook Jr., J.C. Nature. 1979; 281: 216-217Crossref Scopus (916) Google Scholar), more than 50 analogs, including BL precursors, have been identified from plants (4Bajgus A. Tretyn A. Phytochemistry. 2003; 62: 1027-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis pathway from campesterol to BL has been elucidated by feeding isotope-labeled intermediates to suspension cell cultures of Catharanthus roseus and identifying the metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (5Sakurai A. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 37: 351-361Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). BR-deficient and -insensitive dwarf mutants from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), pea (Pisum sativum), and rice (Oryza sativa) have been crucial for the identification of BR biosynthesis enzymes and perception components (1Fujioka S. Yokota T. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 137-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 6Clouse S.D. Mol.

Studies using such BR-related mutants have shown that cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases (P450s) are involved in oxidation reactions at C-2, C-3, C-6, C-22, C-23, and C-26 of BRs (see Fig. 1A) (1Fujioka S. Yokota T. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 137-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 2Clouse S.D. Sasse J.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 427-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). The C-6 oxidation is a likely rate-limiting step for the production of bioactive BRs because 6-deoxocastasterone (6-deoxo CS), an inactive precursor to be oxidized at C-6, commonly accumulates at relatively high levels in several plant species (8Nomura T. Sato T. Bishop G.J. Kamiya Y. Takatsuto S. Yokota T. Phytochemistry. 2001; 57: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The formation of castasterone (CS) from 6-deoxoCS via 6α-hydroxy intermediate is catalyzed by the CYP85A family of P450s (9Bishop G.J. Nomura T. Yokota T. Harrison K. Noguchi T. Fujioka S. Takatsuto S. Jones J.D.G. Kamiya Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1761-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 10Shimada Y. Fujioka S. Miyauchi N. Kushiro M. Takatsuto S. Nomura T. Yokota T. Kamiya Y. Bishop G.J. Yoshida S. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 770-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). CS is further converted to BL by a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation reaction at C-6, resulting in the formation of an unusual seven-membered lactone ring (see Fig. 1A) (11Yokota T. Ogino Y. Takahashi N. Saimoto H. Fujioka S. Sakurai A. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 1107-1108Crossref Google Scholar). Because this reaction increases the biological activity, BL synthase may play a critical role in the regulation of BR-mediated growth and development (12Yokota T. Hooykaas P.J.J. Hall M.A. Libbenga K.R. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Plant Hormones. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1999: 277-293Google Scholar). Recently, a cell-free extract from Phaseolus vulgaris cultured cells suggested an involvement of P450 in the conversion of CS to BL (13Kim T-W. Chang S.C. Lee J.S. Hwang B. Takatsuto S. Yokota T. Kim S.-K. Phytochemistry. 2004; 65: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the identity of this enzyme was unknown. The tomato Dwarf gene encodes CYP85A1 (14Bishop G.J. Harrison K. Jones J.D.G. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 959-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) that catalyzes the synthesis of CS from 6-deoxoCS (see Fig. 1A) (9Bishop G.J. Nomura T. Yokota T. Harrison K. Noguchi T. Fujioka S. Takatsuto S. Jones J.D.G. Kamiya Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1761-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Using a reporter gene fusion, Dwarf has been shown to be expressed both in vegetative tissues and in fruits (15Montoya T. Nomura T. Yokota T. Farrar K. Harrison K. Jones J.G.D. Kaneta T. Kamiya Y. Szekeres M. Bishop G.J. Plant J. 2005; (10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02376.x)PubMed Google Scholar). A null allele, extreme dwarf (dx), shows severely reduced stem length and altered leaf morphology and contains no detectable CS and BL in vegetative tissues (9Bishop G.J. Nomura T. Yokota T. Harrison K. Noguchi T. Fujioka S. Takatsuto S. Jones J.D.G. Kamiya Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1761-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Despite the severe BR-deficient phenotype during the vegetative growth, dx plants are able to produce fruits (see Fig. 1, B–D). To better understand the physiological role of BRs in tomato development, we assessed the effect of the dx mutation on endogenous BR levels in fruits. We show that dx fruits contain CS, indicating the presence of another enzyme catalyzing the C-6 oxidation of 6-deoxoCS. Surprisingly, both wild-type (WT) and dx fruits were found to contain BL, indicating that BL can be synthesized without CYP85A1 activity. We identified another CYP85A gene (CYP85A3) from tomato, which can catalyze the conversion of 6-deoxoCS into BL via CS in yeast. Furthermore, we show that Arabidopsis CYP85A2 has the same enzymatic activity as CYP85A3. The Baeyer-Villiger oxidation producing the steroidal lactone ring has therefore been identified as the last reaction in consecutive oxidative conversions that are catalyzed by multifunctional P450s. Possible roles of CS and BL in plant development are discussed based on their effects on the growth of loss-of-function Arabidopsis mutants of the CYP85A genes. Plant Materials—Near isogenic tomato (L. esculentum) lines of Ailsa Craig carrying either D (GCR 358) or the dx (GCR 567) allele were originally obtained from J. Maxon Smith (Practical Plant Genetics, Littlehampton, UK). Tomato plants were grown either in a glasshouse under natural photoperiod or in a growth chamber under a 16-h light (270 μmol m–2s–1 at 25 °C)/8-h-dark (at 18 °C) cycle. Arabidopsis plants were grown in a growth chamber (continuous light/36 μmol m–2s–1 at 22 °C). Endogenous BR Analysis—Immature fruits were harvested from WT and dx plants in a glasshouse (∼3 cm in diameter). Experimental pools are as follows: first experimental pools, WT, 104 g of fresh weight, and dx 88 g of fresh weight; second experimental pools, WT, 104 g of fresh weight, and dx, 110 g of fresh weight. Endogenous BRs were quantified by GC-selected ion monitoring using deuterated BR internal standards as described previously (8Nomura T. Sato T. Bishop G.J. Kamiya Y. Takatsuto S. Yokota T. Phytochemistry. 2001; 57: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Exogenous BR Application—Seedlings of the cyp85a1/cyp85a2 double mutant and the cpd mutant were grown on 0.5× MS medium containing 2% (w/v) sucrose and 0.8% (w/v) Phytagar (Invitrogen) for 10 days and then transplanted onto medium containing either BL (Fuji Chemical, Japan) or CS (CIDtech Research, Canada) and grown for 4 days. Cloning of New CYP85A Gene—Primer sequences used in this study are shown in Table S1 as supplemental data. Primers D-F1 and D-R1 were designed based on highly conserved nucleotide sequences of tomato CYP85A1 (Dwarf), Arabidopsis CYP85A1 and CYP85A2, and pea CYP85A1. 2T. Nomura and T. Yokota, unpublished data. PCR amplification was carried out on a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems) with the Expand high fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) using genomic DNA from dx plants. The resulting 2426-bp product was sequenced using ABI PRISM 3100 sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). Based on this sequence, gene-specific primers were designed to amplify the 5′- and 3′-end of tomato CYP85A3 gene. Primers D-R3, D-R7, and D-R5 were used sequentially for 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends reactions that finally produced a 571-bp product of the 5′-end. Primers D-F2 and D-F6 were used for 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends reactions that produced a 521-bp product of the 3′-end. Template DNA was from a single-strand cDNA library that was made from dx immature fruits (∼2 cm in diameter). The resulting products were sequenced, and these fragments were assembled to construct a 1404-bp open reading frame. Primers ToD2-F1 (BglII site at the initiation codon) and ToD2-R1 (KpnI site at the stop codon) were used to amplify the full-length cDNA, and eight clones were sequenced to check the PCR errors. Sequence analysis was performed using MacVector software (Oxford Molecular Group). The phylogenetic tree was constructed by using a ClustalW program in the DDBJ homepage (www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/Welcome-e.html). Semiquantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Organ-specific expression of the CYP85A1 and CYP85A3 gene was examined. RNA was isolated from aerial tissue and roots excised from pools of 12 individuals of 20-day-old seedlings of WT and dx grown in a growth chamber. RNA was made from pools of 3–5 immature fruits (∼0.5, 1, 2, and 3 cm in diameter) harvested from WT plants grown in a growth chamber and 3 immature fruits (∼2 cm in diameter) harvested from dx plants grown in a glasshouse. Total RNA was extracted by using an RNAqueous kit with Plant RNA Isolation Aid (Ambion). Single-strand cDNA was synthesized using 2.5 μg of total RNA, SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and oligo(dT) primer according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplification was performed for a total of 35 cycles using the following primers at the given concentrations: 0.3 μm D-F7 and D-R8 (to amplify tomato CYP85A3); 0.3 μm DW52 and DW53 (to amplify tomato CYP85A1); and 0.1 μm TACT1 and TACT2 (to amplify actin as a control) (16Montoya T. Nomura T. Farrar K. Kaneta T. Yokota T. Bishop G.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3163-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The products were sequenced to confirm the identify of the bands. Gels stained with ethidium bromide were photographed using a luminescent image analyzer LAS-3000 (Fujifilm). Yeast Functional Assay—The CYP85A1 and CYP85A2 cDNAs of Arabidopsis were amplified from a single-strand cDNA library made from young siliques (∼3 mm in length) of Arabidopsis using primer pairs: 85A1-F1 (BamHI site at the initiation codon) and 85A1-R1 (KpnI site at the stop codon) and 85A2-F1 (BamHI site at the initiation codon) and 85A2-R1 (KpnI site at the stop codon), respectively. These PCR products were cloned using TOPO TA Cloning (Invitrogen) and checked to ensure that no PCR errors were introduced. The plasmids containing tomato CYP85A3 (see above) and Arabidopsis CYP85As were cut with primer-specific restriction enzymes and then ligated to BamHI- and KpnI-cut plasmid YeDP60 (17Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tomato CYP85A3- and CYP85A1-pYeDP60 (pGB233A1) (9Bishop G.J. Nomura T. Yokota T. Harrison K.

Transformed colonies were inoculated into 10 ml of SGI medium (17Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were grown at 30 °C for 1 day in a shaking incubator (200 rpm). The SGI-cultured yeast medium (1 ml) was inoculated into 10 ml of SLI medium (pH 5.4) (17Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and grown at 28 °C for 1 day until the cell density reached 4 × 107 cells ml–1. Cells were pelleted by a 500 × g spin and resuspended in fresh SLI medium to obtain 8 × 106 cells ml–1. Diluted yeast culture (5 ml) was incubated with 1 μg (0.4 μm) of a BR substrate at 28 °C for 15 h until the cell density reached 6 × 107 cells ml–1. To prepare microsomal proteins, yeast cells collected from 500 ml of SLI culture (5 × 107 cells ml–1) were suspended in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) and passed through a French press (25 000 p.s.i.). The broken cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Microsomal fraction was suspended in 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6). 6-DeoxoCS (20 μm) was incubated with 75 μg (in a 50-μl volume) of microsomal protein containing NADPH (500 μm) at 25 °C for 10 min to 4 h. BRs were extracted with ethyl acetate and the extract was partitioned against 0.5 m dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (pH 9). The ethyl acetate phase was evaporated to dryness and partitioned between n-hexane and 80% methanol. The latter phase was evaporated to dryness and derivatized with pyridine containing methaneboronic acid (2 mg ml–1) prior to GC-MS analysis using an Automass (JEOL) plus 6890N (Agilent Technologies) instrument equipped with a DB-1 column (J & W Scientific; 0.25 mm × 15 m; 0.25-μm film thickness) under the same conditions as Ref. 8Nomura T.

Brassinolide Is Accumulated in Tomato Fruits—The dx mutant is severely dwarfed due to BR deficiency (Fig. 1B) (9Bishop G.J. Nomura T. Yokota T. Harrison K. Noguchi T. Fujioka S. Takatsuto S.

To examine the influence of the dx mutation on BR synthesis in fruits, endogenous BR levels were determined using GC-MS (Table I). Unexpectedly, BL was detected in both dx and WT fruits. In one of the experiments using dx fruits, a strikingly high level of BL was detected. CS was detectable in both fruits but was decreased in abundance in dx fruits relative to WT. In vegetative tissues, the level of 6-deoxoCS is increased in the dx mutant because its conversion into CS is blocked (9Bishop G.J. Nomura T. Yokota T. Harrison K. Noguchi T. Fujioka S. Takatsuto S. Jones J.D.G. Kamiya Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1761-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, the level of 6-deoxoCS in dx fruits was comparable with that in WT fruits. These results indicate that the dx mutation in fruits does not significantly block the C-6 oxidation of 6-deoxoCS. This finding, as well as the accumulation of BL in the dx fruits, implies the occurrence of a CYP85A1-independent synthesis pathway of BL.Table IEndogenous BR levels in tomato fruitsWTdx1st exp.2nd exp.1st exp.2nd exp.BL1436570287CS535141796-DeoxoCS19575123170729846-DeoxotyphasterolNDaND, not detected.60NDaND, not detected.863-Dehydro-6-deoxoteasterone73715366-DeoxoteasteroneNDaND, not detected.6210766-Deoxocathasterone426733627916a ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab Tomato CYP85A3 Gene—In dx fruits, BL is likely to be synthesized from 6-deoxoCS via CS, suggesting that the enzyme responsible is expected to be in the CYP85A family. To identify this new gene, we designed oligonucleotide primers based on the conserved nucleotide sequences among the CYP85A genes of tomato, Arabidopsis, and pea. A DNA fragment that is closely related to tomato CYP85A1 was amplified by PCR from dx genomic DNA. The corresponding fulllength cDNA was identified by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using dx immature fruits as the source of mRNA templates. Sequence analysis revealed that the cDNA encodes a protein consisting of 467 amino acids that show 75% identity and 85% similarity with tomato CYP85A1 (see supplemental data, Fig. S1). A new CYP number, CYP85A3, was given to this sequence based on the deduced P450 domain (L. esculentum CYP85A3, accession number AB190445). A phylogenetic tree among BR-related P450s was constructed using amino acid sequences of CYP85A, CYP90A (BR C-23 hydroxylation) (18Szekeres M. Nemeth K. Kalman Z.K. Mathur J. Kauschmann A. Altmann T.

Tomato CYP85A3 was placed on the same branch as the CYP85A family of tomato (9Bishop G.J. Nomura T. Yokota T. Harrison K. Noguchi T. Fujioka S. Takatsuto S. Jones J.D.G. Kamiya Y. Proc. Natl. Acad.

These observations suggest that the CYP85A genes duplicated independently in tomato and Arabidopsis. Tomato CYP85A3 Is Preferentially Expressed in Fruits— Transcript abundance of tomato CYP85A1 and CYP85A3 genes in WT shoots, roots, and fruits was investigated by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis (Fig. 3). The CYP85A1 transcript was detected in all WT samples examined, whereas the CYP85A3 mRNA accumulated in fruits, indicating that CYP85A3 was a strong candidate for C-6 oxidation in the synthesis of BL. The presence of CYP85A3 mRNA in fruits of the dx mutant corroborated this result. Tomato CYP85A3 Produces BL in Recombinant Yeast—To examine whether tomato CYP85A3 possesses BR C-6 oxidation activity, we carried out functional expression in yeast. Tomato CYP85A3 cDNA was cloned into plasmid YeDP60 that allows galactose-inducible expression of P450s in yeast (17Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a positive control, we used pGB233A1 (CYP85A1 cDNA in pYeDP60) (9Bishop G.J. Nomura T. Yokota T. Harrison K. Noguchi T. Fujioka S. Takatsuto S. Jones J.D.G. Kamiya Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1761-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) that produces tomato CYP85A1 in yeast in response to galactose. A yeast strain WAT11 was used as the host because it is engineered to co-produce Arabidopsis NADPH P450 reductase 1 and is able to donate the electrons required for plant P450 activity (17Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induced cultures of the transformants were incubated with predicted substrates, and the products were analyzed by GC-MS (Fig. 4). When [2H6]6-deoxoCS was incubated with the recombinant yeast producing tomato CYP85A3, a large fraction of the added substrate was metabolized to produce [2H6]CS, confirming that CYP85A3 has C-6 oxidation activity like previously characterized CYP85A members (9Bishop G.J. Nomura T. Yokota T. Harrison K. Noguchi T. Fujioka S. Takatsuto S. Jones J.D.G. Kamiya Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1761-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 10Shimada Y.

Plant J. 2002; 32: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, careful examination of the metabolites revealed that another product cooccurred with [2H6]CS (Fig. 4A). The second product was determined to be [2H6]BL by full-scan GC-MS, as detailed in Table II. [2H6]BL was produced in neither the control (pYeDP60) nor the recombinant yeast producing tomato CYP85A1. These results illustrate that CYP85A3, but not CYP85A1, catalyzes the conversion(s) of 6-deoxoCS into BL. When [2H6]CS was incubated with the CYP85A3 recombinant yeast, about half of the substrate was converted to [2H6]BL (Fig. 4B). However, [2H6]CS remained unmetabolized after incubation with the control or recombinant yeast producing tomato CYP85A1. Taken together, these results indicate that tomato CYP85A3 catalyzes the conversion of 6-deoxoCS into BL via the formation of CS, whereas tomato CYP85A1 produces CS as the predominant C-6 oxidation product from 6-deoxoCS (9Bishop G.J.

Nakamura A. Takatsuto S. Fujioka S. Yoshida S. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Because tomato CYP85A3 catalyzes the conversion of 6-deoxoCS and CS to BL (Fig. 4) and is closely related to other members of the CYP85A family (Fig. 2), we re-examined the enzyme activity of Arabidopsis CYP85A1 and CYP85A2 (see supplemental data, Fig. S2). Consistent with the previous report (10Shimada Y. Fujioka S. Miyauchi N. Kushiro M. Takatsuto S. Nomura T. Yokota T. Kamiya Y. Bishop G.J. Yoshida S. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 770-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), the recombinant yeast expressing Arabidopsis CYP85A1 catalyzed the formation of CS from 6-deoxoCS but did not produce BL. On the other hand, 6-deoxoCS was converted to both CS and BL in the recombinant yeast cells that contained Arabidopsis CYP85A2. These data indicate that Arabidopsis CYP85A1 is a C-6 oxidase involved in the production of CS from 6-deoxoCS, whereas Arabidopsis CYP85A2 contains an additional enzyme activity that converts CS into BL. In an attempt to examine the in vitro kinetics of the enzymes, microsomal proteins were prepared from the recombinant yeast cells and were incubated with 6-deoxoCS. C-6 oxidation activity of microsomes from tomato CYP85A3 and Arabidopsis CYP85A2 was not sufficient to readily determine the Km and Vmax of these enzymes (data not shown). This is possibly due to reduced stability of the enzyme in a microsomal preparation as discussed for another plant P450 (24Helliwell C.A. Poole A. Peacock W.J. Dennis E.S. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Loss-of-Function Mutations in the Arabidopsis CYP85A1 and CYP85A2 Genes—To assess the relative physiological roles of the two CYP85As in Arabidopsis, we examined the phenotype of T-DNA insertion lines. Two mutant alleles (cyp85a1–1 (SALK_068952) and cyp85a1–2 (SALK_101866)) containing T-DNA insertion in the coding region of the CYP85A1 gene grew similarly to WT plants throughout the life cycle (Fig. 5A). In contrast, three independent alleles (cyp85a2–1 (SALK_056270), cyp85a2–2 (SALK_129352), and cyp85a2–3 (SALK_068754)) having T-DNA insertions in the coding region of the CYP85A2 gene consistently exhibited a weak dwarf phenotype during early vegetative development (Fig. 5A) and a reduced fertility after bolting, although the final plant height appeared normal (data not shown). When the cyp85a1 and cyp85a2 mutants were crossed, the resulting digenic mutants grew as severe dwarfs that were reminiscent of the known strong BR-deficient mutan"
https://openalex.org/W2048663475,"p53 is a tumor suppressor gene whose regulation is crucial to maintaining genome stability and for the apoptotic elimination of abnormal, potentially cancer-predisposing cells. C. elegans contains a primordial p53 gene, cep-1, that acts as a transcription factor necessary for DNA damage-induced apoptosis. In a genetic screen for negative regulators of CEP-1, we identified a mutation in GLD-1, a translational repressor implicated in multiple C. elegans germ cell fate decisions and related to mammalian Quaking proteins. CEP-1-dependent transcription of proapoptotic genes is upregulated in the gld-1(op236) mutant and an elevation of p53-mediated germ cell apoptosis in response to DNA damage is observed. Further, we demonstrate that GLD-1 mediates its repressive effect by directly binding to the 3'UTR of cep-1/p53 mRNA and repressing its translation. This study reveals that the regulation of cep-1/p53 translation influences DNA damage-induced apoptosis and demonstrates the physiological importance of this mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2037770718,"Exposure to sources of UV radiation, such as sunlight, induces a number of cellular alterations that are highly dependent on its ability to affect gene expression. Among them, the rapid activation of genes coding for two subfamilies of proto-oncoproteins, Fos and Jun, which constitute the AP-1 transcription factor, plays a key role in the subsequent regulation of expression of genes involved in DNA repair, cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, death by apoptosis, and tissue and extracellular matrix remodeling proteases. Besides being regulated at the transcriptional level, Jun and Fos transcriptional activities are also regulated by phosphorylation as a result of the activation of intracellular signaling cascades. In this regard, the phosphorylation of c-Jun by UV-induced JNK has been readily documented, whereas a role for Fos proteins in UV-mediated responses and the identification of Fos-activating kinases has remained elusive. Here we identify p38 MAPKs as proteins that can associate with c-Fos and phosphorylate its transactivation domain both in vitro and in vivo. This phosphorylation is transduced into changes in its transcriptional ability as p38-activated c-Fos enhances AP1-driven gene expression. Our findings indicate that as a consequence of the activation of stress pathways induced by UV light, endogenous c-Fos becomes a substrate of p38 MAPKs and, for the first time, provide evidence that support a critical role for p38 MAPKs in mediating stress-induced c-Fos phosphorylation and gene transcription activation. Using a specific pharmacological inhibitor for p38α and -β, we found that most likely these two isoforms mediate UV-induced c-Fos phosphorylation in vivo. Thus, these newly described pathways act concomitantly with the activation of c-Jun by JNK/MAPKs, thereby contributing to the complexity of AP1-driven gene transcription regulation.

These kinases play an essential role in the transduction of environmental stimuli to the nucleus, as they are capable of regulating the expression of genes involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, programmed cell death, and neoplastic transformation (11Davis R.J.

MAPKs have been classified into at least six subfamilies, among which the Erk/MAPKs (Erk1 and -2), JNKs (JNK1, -2, and -3), and p38 kinases (α, β, γ, and δ) are the most extensively studied. Erk5 (also known as Big MAPK or BMPK) (14Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D.

A variety of mitogens acting on cell surface cellular receptors promote the sequential activation of small GTP-binding proteins of the Ras and Rho family and a cascade of protein kinases that ultimately phosphorylate and activate each MAPK. Indeed, each MAPK is specifically regulated by MAPK kinases (MAPKKs). Despite the knowledge accumulated on agonist-induced MAPK activation, the way stresses are sensed and where and how the signals are converted into SAPKs activation with the consequent triggering of nuclear responses are still open questions. Among the immediate early genes that are rapidly turned on by UV light are the members of the AP-1 transcription factor family (22Chen G. Hitomi M. Han J. Stacey D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38973-38980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), which play a key role in normal and abnormal epithelial cell growth and differentiation (23Karin M.

AP-1 proteins are often the final target of signal-transducing kinase cascades, and upon phosphorylation become transcriptionally active triggering the activity of AP-1-driven promoters and the expression of their corresponding regulated genes (41Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.X. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The best studied example is the phosphorylation of c-Jun by UV-activated JNK, which in turn acts on AP-1 sequences present on its own promoter. Recently, it has been shown that a parallel pathway involving platelet-derived growth factor-activated Erk2 also leads to the phosphorylation of c-Fos and consequent AP-1 activation (42Monje P. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7030-7043Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 43Murphy L.O. Smith S. Chen R.H. Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). In addition, the involvement of the three major MAPK pathways (ERK, JNK, and p38) in the induction of the c-fos promoter has been reported (44Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 45Kalra N. Kumar V. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2002; 283: C1530-C1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, the activation of c-Fos proteins by MAPKs in response to stress-activated signaling pathways has not been investigated extensively. In this study, we show that c-Fos is rapidly phosphorylated in response to UV light exposure and that this phosphorylation is mostly dependent on UV-induced p38 kinases rather than resulting from Erk1/2 or JNK activation. Moreover, we observed that the phosphorylation of c-Fos in its transactivation domain leads to c-Fos transcriptional activation and to c-Fos-mediated AP-1 activity. In addition, by using an array of point mutations, we examined the contribution of each putative p38 target residue within the c-Fos transactivation domain to its transcriptional response. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that involves c-Fos as a target of UV-triggered, p38-mediated signaling pathways that influences AP-1 activity and the subsequent regulation of genes involved in cellular responses to injury caused by DNA-damaging agents. Culture of Cell Lines—HEK 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (Invitrogen). NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum and the above antimicrobial mixture. Transient Transfections—NIH 3T3 and HEK 293 cells were plated in complete media and allowed to grow overnight to 70–80% confluence in 6-well plates or 6-cm plates. The cells were transfected using Lipofectamine Plus Reagent (Invitrogen), according to the protocol directed by the manufacturer, using up to 2 μg of DNA per transfection. DNA Constructs—Plasmids carrying the cDNA for the AU5-tagged forms of c-Fos FL and TAD (pCEFL AU5 c-Fos FL and TAD, respectively), pCEFL AU5 c-Fos mut FL, as well as pGal4 c-Fos TAD wt, and its mutants TAD mut, Thr-232, Thr-325, Thr-331, and Ser-374 have been described previously (42Monje P. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7030-7043Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The pCEFL GFP c-Fos plasmids (FL and TAD wt and mutants) were made by shifting the c-Fos fragments from the pCEFL AU5 forms into the pCEFL GFP-tagged vector. pGEX 4T3-c-Fos TAD mutants were constructed by transferring c-Fos cDNA inserts from the different pGal4 TAD constructs as BamHI-NotI fragments to the pGEX 4T3 vector. pAP1-Luc and pGal4-Luc have been described (47Marinissen M.J.

Bacterial Expression of GST Fusion Proteins—The BL 21 Lys strain of Escherichia coli was transformed with the vector pGEX-4T3 encoding the fusion proteins GST-ATF2 or GST-c-Fos TAD wt, and its mutants TAD mut, Thr-232, Thr-325, Thr-331, and Ser-374. Bacteria were grown in 500 ml of LB medium until the optical density was 0.5, at which time isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm final) was added for 3 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in 10 ml of PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF. The cell suspension was sonicated, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was mixed with 300 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was washed three times with PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF and then twice with PBS, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF. Finally, purified fusion proteins were eluted in 50 mm Tris, 10 mm glutathione, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF. Kinase Assays—HEK 293 cells were transfected with expression vectors for HA-tagged kinases, alone or in combination with the respective upstream-activating molecules. 24 hours after transfection, cells were starved with serum-free media for 2 h, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed at 4 °C in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). HA-tagged kinases were immunoprecipitated from the cleared lysates by incubation with the specific antibody against HA (MMS-101R, Covance) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were recovered with the aid of Gamma-Bind-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and washed three times with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 2 mm sodium vanadate, once with 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m LiCl, and once in kinase reaction buffer (12.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.5 mm sodium vanadate). The kinase activity present in the immunoprecipitates was determined by resuspension in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per reaction and 20 μm of unlabeled ATP, using 1 μg of substrate. After 30 min at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer (400 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 50% glycerol, 500 mm DTT, and 2 μ/ml bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. Denatured samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels, and autoradiographs were taken from the corresponding dried gels using X-Omat Kodak or AGFA CP-BU films. Parallel immunoprecipitates were processed for Western blot analysis using the same antiserum as described (38Coso O.A. Montaner S. Fromm C. Lacal J.C. Prywes R. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Western Blot Analysis—24 hours after transfection cells were washed with PBS twice and resuspended in Lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm PMSF, and 0.4 m NaCl). Cleared lysates were combined with SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Fractionated proteins were blotted to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% nonfat-dried milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate dilution of each of these primary antibodies as follows: anti-AU5 epitope from Covance (MMS-135R), anti-c-Fos from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-52X), and anti-GFP from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-9996). Membranes were washed with PBS-T prior to incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-goat secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL+Plus System, Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies targeted to the phosphorylated forms of JNK and p38 kinases were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells were seeded on 6-well dishes and transfected with different expression plasmids together with 0.1 μg of luciferase reporter vector and 0.01 μg of pRL-null (a plasmid expressing the enzyme Renilla luciferase from Renilla reniformis). The total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted with pcDNAIII β-galactosidase. Cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega) 24 h post-transfection. Cell lysates (50 μl/well) were transferred to a 96-well luminometer plate, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed using the Dual-luciferase Reporter System (Promega). Light emission was quantitated using the Monolight 2010 luminometer as specified by the manufacturer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). Indirect Immunofluorescence—HEK 293T cells were seeded on glass coverslips and transfected by Lipofectamine Plus Reagents (Invitrogen) as described above. 16–20-h serum-starved cells were washed twice with 1× PBS, fixed, and then permeabilized with 4% formaldehyde and 0.5% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS for 10 min. After washing with PBS, cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with anti-HA (Covance) as primary antibodies for 1 h. Following incubation, cells were washed three times with 1× PBS and then incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies (1:200) conjugated with tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Coverslips were washed three times, mounted in Vectashield mounting medium with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories), and viewed using a Zeiss Axiophot photomicroscope equipped with epifluorescence. To analyze the subcellular localization of GFP-c-Fos in the presence of dominant negative mediators of p38 signaling, we followed the same protocol, and the images were captured on an Olympus Fluoview FV300 laser-scanning confocal microscope. UV Stimulation—HEK 293 cells were transfected and starved overnight. 24 hours after transfection, the medium was removed, and the cells were irradiated in a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene) with 120 J/m2. Culture medium was then restored, and the cells were returned to the incubator for the indicated times before further analysis. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were obtained from HEK 293 cells plated in 10-cm plates and grown to 70% confluence, starved overnight, and then treated with UV light and pretreated with the SB 203580 compound as indicated. Cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF). After 15 min on ice, 25 μl of 10% of Nonidet P-40 was added and vigorously vortexed for 10 s. Homogenates were centrifuged for 30 s in a microcentrifuge. The nuclear pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold hypotonic buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.42 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF) and rocked at 4 °C for 15 min on a shaking platform. Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 min, and the supernatants (nuclear extracts) were aliquoted and stored at –70 °C. After determining protein concentrations using protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories), 2 μg of protein were incubated at room temperature with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 0.1 μg of salmon sperm DNA in 20 μl of binding buffer (12 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 60 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.12 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm DTT, 0.3 mm PMSF, 12% glycerol) for 15 min. Complementary synthetic oligonucleotides containing a canonical AP1 site was obtained from Promega and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). Labeled oligonucleotides were purified using G-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences) and used as probes (20,000 cpm/reaction) added to the reactions for an additional 15 min. Complexes were analyzed on nondenaturing (4.5%) polyacrylamide gels in TGE buffer (40 mm Tris, 270 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) run at 13 V/cm at 4 °C. For supershift assays, 1 μg of anti-c-Fos sc-52X antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the binding reaction prior to the addition of the radiolabeled probe for 15 min. Cell Fractionation and Nuclear Translocation Assay—Nuclear extracts were separated from its corresponding cytoplasmic fractions as already described above for the electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Homogenates from the nuclear extracts were obtained by incubation with hypotonic buffer as indicated above. SDS sample loading buffer was added to samples from both fractions before loading SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes as indicated. The protein bound to the membranes was detected by Western blot with the aid of the same anti-c-Fos antibody mentioned above. Two-hybrid Assays (Sos Rescue System)—To assay for protein-protein interaction in yeast, we employed the Sos rescue system, which takes advantage of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain carrying a Cdc25 allele that displays a temperature-sensitive phenotype. This cdc25-2 strain can be propagated at 28 °C but is unable to grow at 37 °C unless hybrid proteins expressed by transfected plasmids can bring a human version of SOS, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Ras, to the plasma membrane and therefore promote GTP loading on Ras and cell growth. A HeLa cells cDNA expression library fused to the Src myristoylation signal was utilized and challenged with plasmids that express fusion proteins between human SOS and p38 MAPKs. Protocols for growth of the yeast strains and transfection with plasmid DNAs have been described previously (50Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). p38γ Interacts with c-Fos in a SOS Two-hybrid Assay—In order to identify unknown p38-binding proteins that might take part in p38-mediated signaling pathways, we performed an SOS yeast two-hybrid screen (50Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) of a HeLa cells-cDNA library fused to an Src myristoylation signal using the human p38s as bait. In this system, the bait is attached to the coding sequence of the exchange factor for Ras, SOS. Thus, only proteins that bring SOS close to the plasma membrane result in GTP loading on Ras and therefore allow growth of the cdc25ts yeast strain at the restrictive temperature of 37 °C (Fig. 1A). By using the full-length p38γ cDNA as bait, we obtained several candidate clones. The sequence of one of them, clone E62-83, corresponded to amino acids 137–239 of the AP-1 member c-Fos. Fig. 1B shows that although yeast strains containing the DNA for clone E62-83 together with plasmids encoding either the bait or an empty vector grew well at 28 °C, growth at the restrictive temperature of 37 °C was only achieved when the bait was present (Fig. 1B, left panels). Positive controls using a full-length cDNA for c-Jun, a well known c-Fos-interacting protein, are depicted on the right panels. c-Fos Is Phosphorylated in Vitro by SAPKs—It is known that the reversible phosphorylation of the transcriptional activation domain (TAD) of transcription factors may result in the positive or negative regulation of its transactivating properties (23Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar). As described previously, the C-terminal portion of c-Fos encodes a motif exhibiting transactivating potential (51Sutherland J.A. Cook A. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1810-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This region displays at least four MAPK potential phosphorylation sites with the consensus sequence (S/T)P located at positions Thr-232, Thr-325, Thr-331, and Ser-375 (42Monje P. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7030-7043Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As the region of c-Fos involved in the interaction with p38γ comprises the first portion of its TAD, we decided to explore whether c-Fos was a target of"

In this study, seven populations of ginseng plants were censused every 3 weeks during the growing season over 5 years to monitor deer browse and harvest and to project population growth and viability. The minimum viable population size was ∼800 plants, a value greater than that of all populations currently being monitored. When simulated deer browsing rates were reduced 50% or more, population viability rose sharply. Without more effective deer population control, ginseng and many other valuable understory herbs are likely to become extinct in the coming century."

Because several genes that regulate cellular proliferation, carcinogenesis, metastasis, and survival are regulated by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), we postulated that evodiamine mediates its activity by modulating NF-κB activation. In the present study, we investigated the effect of evodiamine on NF-κB and NF-κB-regulated gene expression activated by various carcinogens. We demonstrate that evodiamine was a highly potent inhibitor of NF-κB activation, and it abrogated both inducible and constitutive NF-κB activation. The inhibition corresponded with the sequential suppression of IκBα kinase activity, IκBα phosphorylation, IκBα degradation, p65 phosphorylation, p65 nuclear translocation, and p65 acetylation. Evodiamine also inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced Akt activation and its association with IKK. Suppression of Akt activation was specific, because it had no effect on JNK or p38 MAPK activation. Evodiamine also inhibited the NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression activated by TNF, TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2, NIK, and IKK but not that activated by the p65 subunit of NF-κB. NF-κB-regulated gene products such as Cyclin D1, c-Myc, COX-2, MMP-9, ICAM-1, MDR1, Survivin, XIAP, IAP1, IAP2, FLIP, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bfl-1/A1 were all down-regulated by evodiamine. This down-regulation potentiated the apoptosis induced by cytokines and chemotherapeutic agents and suppressed TNF-induced invasive activity. Overall, our results indicated that evodiamine inhibits both constitutive and induced NF-κB activation and NF-κB-regulated gene expression and that this inhibition may provide a molecular basis for the ability of evodiamine to suppress proliferation, induce apoptosis, and inhibit metastasis. Evodiamine, an alkaloidal component extracted from the fruit of Evodiae fructus (Evodia rutaecarpa Benth., Rutaceae), exhibits antiproliferative, antimetastatic, and apoptotic activities through a poorly defined mechanism. Because several genes that regulate cellular proliferation, carcinogenesis, metastasis, and survival are regulated by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), we postulated that evodiamine mediates its activity by modulating NF-κB activation.

Given the widespread use of diverse complementary and alternative medicine approaches by cancer patients, the research to establish the safety and efficacy is lacking. This provides many opportunities for prevention and treatment of cancer and other diseases (1Richardson M.A. Straus S.E. Semin. Oncol. 2002; 29: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The discovery and subsequent development of novel chemical entities into anticancer drugs are the goals of cancer researchers. Compounds from traditional Chinese medicine have in recent decades been examined for their anticancer potential, and for those compounds that do exhibit such potential, the delineation of their mechanism of action may have an enormous influence on the development of new cancer therapies. The fruit of “Wu-Zhu-Yu” (Evodiae fructus; Evodia rutaecarpa Benth., Rutaceae) is used in traditional Chinese medicine as a cardiotonic (2Li S.C. Pen-Tsao Kang Mu. National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Taipei1976: 1064Google Scholar). The active constituents of this fruit are evodiamine and rutaecarpine, which are indole alkaloids found in large amounts in the Chinese medicine evodia and are the main compounds responsible for the antianoxic action (3Yamahara J.

Besides its antiproliferative and apoptotic effects, evodiamine suppresses the invasion and migration of human colon carcinoma cells and melanoma cells to the lung (9Ogasawara M. Suzuki H. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10Ogasawara M. Matsubara T. Suzuki H. Biol. Pharm.

How evodiamine regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration is incompletely understood. We postulated that this compound mediates its effects by modulating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), a transcription factor that plays a major role in tumorigenesis (13Aggarwal B.B. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 203-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). NF-κB regulates several genes that mediate proliferation (e.g. Cyclin D1 and c-Myc), antiapoptosis (e.g. Survivin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1), cellular Fas-associated death domain protein-like interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein (FLIP), inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein (IAP), X chromosome-linked IAP (XIAP), Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL), drug resistance (e.g. multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1)), immunomodulation (e.g. chemokines and interleukins), and metastasis (e.g. cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)) (14Yamamoto K.

NF-κB is activated by various carcinogens and inflammatory stimuli, including cigarette smoke, TNF, IL-1β, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and lipopolysaccharide. NF-κB consists of a p50/p65 heterodimer, which is retained in the cytoplasm by the masking of nuclear localization sequence by IκBα, the inhibitor of NF-κB. Upon activation of NF-κB, IκBα kinase (IKK) is activated, leading to IκBα phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation; therefore, release of p50/p65 the heterodimer, then translocates to the nucleus, binds to its consensus sequence, and induces gene transcription. We postulated that evodiamine interferes with this NF-κB activation pathway and suppresses gene transcription. Because the TNF-induced NF-κB activation pathway has been well characterized, we studied the effects of evodiamine on TNF-induced NF-κB activation. In our study, evodiamine suppressed the NF-κB activation induced by a wide variety of agents irrespective of cell type, suppressed expression of various antiapoptotic and proliferative gene products, and enhanced the apoptosis and suppressed the invasive activity induced by cytokines and chemotherapeutic agents. Reagents—Evodiamine isolated as previously described before (29Shoji N. Umeyama A. Takemoto T. Kajiwara A. Ohizumi Y. J. Pharm. Sci. 1986; 75: 612-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A solution (250 μm) of evodiamine was prepared with Me2SO, stored as small aliquots at –20 °C, and diluted as needed in cell culture medium. Bacteria-derived recombinant human TNF, purified to homogeneity with a specific activity of 5 × 107 units/mg, was kindly provided by Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Cigarette smoke condensate, prepared as previously described (30Anto R.J. Mukhopadhyay A. Shishodia S. Gairola C.G. Aggarwal B.B. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was kindly supplied by Dr. C. Gary Gairola (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). Penicillin, streptomycin, RPMI 1640 medium, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were obtained from Invitrogen. PMA, okadaic acid, H2O2, and anti-β-actin antibody were obtained from Aldrich-Sigma. Antibodies against p65, p50, IκBα, Akt, p38 MAPK, JNK1, Cyclin D1, c-Myc, MMP-9, ICAM-1, MDR1, IAP1, IAP2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bfl-1/A1, and PARP were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-COX-2 and anti-XIAP antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences. Phospho-specific anti-IκBα (Ser-32), phospho-specific anti-p65 (Ser-536), phospho-specific anti-Akt, phospho-specific anti-p38 MAPK, and anti-acetyllysine antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-IKK-α, anti-IKK-β, and anti-FLIP antibodies were kindly provided by Imgenex (San Diego, CA). Cell Lines—KBM-5 (human myeloid leukemia), H1299 (human lung adenocarcinoma), Jurkat (human T-cell lymphoma), A293 (human embryonic kidney), FaDu (human squamous cell carcinoma), and U266 (human multiple myeloma) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Bethesda, MD). KBM-5 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 15% FBS, H1299, Jurkat, and U266 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, A293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, and FaDu cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS, 100 μm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm pyruvate, 6 mml-glutamine, and 1× vitamins. All culture media were also supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. EMSA—To assess NF-κB activation, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described previously (31Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23390-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts prepared from TNF-treated cells were incubated with 32P-end-labeled 45-mer double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide (15 μg of protein with 16 fmol of DNA) from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat 5′-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′ (boldface indicates NF-κB binding sites) for 30 min at 37 °C, and the DNA-protein complex formed was separated from free oligonucleotide on 6.6% native polyacrylamide gels. A double-stranded mutated oligonucleotide, 5′-TTGTTACAACTCACTTTCCGCTGCTCACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′, was used to examine the specificity of binding of NF-κB to the DNA. The specificity of binding was also examined by competition with the unlabeled oligonucleotide. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts prepared from TNF-treated cells were incubated with antibodies against the p50 or p65 subunit of NF-κB for 15 min at 37 °C before the complex was analyzed by EMSA. Anti-Cyclin D1 antibody and preimmune serum were included as negative controls. The dried gels were visualized with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), and bands were quantitated using ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot Analysis—To determine the levels of protein expression in the cytoplasm or nucleus, we prepared extracts (32Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3278-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and fractionated them by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blotted with each antibody, and detected with enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The bands obtained were quantitated using NIH Image (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Kinase Assay—To determine the effect of evodiamine on TNF-induced IKK activation, we performed an immunocomplex kinase assay as described previously (33Takada Y. Mukhopadhyay A. Kundu G.C. Mahabeleshwar G.H. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24233-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Briefly, the IKK complex from whole cell extracts was precipitated with antibody against IKK-α followed by treatment with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Pierce). After 2 h of incubation, the beads were washed with lysis buffer and assayed in a kinase assay mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm unlabeled ATP, and 2 μg of substrate glutathione S-transferase (GST)-IκBα (amino acids 1–54). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by boiling with SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Finally, the protein was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, the gel was dried, and the radioactive bands were visualized with a PhosphorImager. To determine the total amounts of IKK-α and IKK-β in each sample, 50 μg of the whole cell protein was resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with anti-IKK-α or anti-IKK-β antibody. For JNK assay, whole cell extracts was precipitated with antibody against JNK1, and performed kinase assay using GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1–79). NF-κB-dependent Reporter Gene Expression Assay—The effect of evodiamine on TNF-, TNFR-, TRADD-, TRAF2-, NIK-, IKK-, and p65-induced NF-κB-dependent reporter gene transcription was analyzed by secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) assay as previously described. Briefly, A293 cells were plated in 12-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) and transiently transfected by FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). To examine TNF-induced reporter gene expression, we transfected the cells with 0.2 μg of the SEAP expression plasmid for 24 h. Thereafter we treated the cells for 24 h with 250 nm evodiamine and then stimulated them with 1 nm TNF for a further 24 h. To examine the expression of various gene-induced reporter genes, we transfected cells with 0.2 μg of reporter gene plasmid with each 0.5 μg of expressing plasmid for 24 h and then treated the cells with 250 nm evodiamine for 48 h. The cell culture medium was harvested and analyzed for SEAP activity according to the protocol essentially as described by the manufacturer (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using a Victor 3 microplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoprecipitation of p65 for p65 Acetylation—To determine the effect of evodiamine on TNF-induced acetylation of p65, cells (5 × 106) were treated, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin to prepare whole cell lysates. Whole cell extracts were incubated with anti-p65 antibody for 2 h and precipitated using protein A/G-Sepharose beads. After 1 h of incubation, immunocomplexes were washed with lysis buffer, boiled with SDS sample buffer for 5 min, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-acetyllysine antibody. Immunocytochemical Analysis of NF-κB p65 Localization—The effect of evodiamine on the nuclear translocation of p65 was examined by immunocytochemistry as previously described (34Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4750-4759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, treated cells were plated on a poly-l-lysine-coated glass slide by centrifugation using a Cytospin 4 (Thermoshendon, Pittsburg, PA), air dried, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde following permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100. After being washed in PBS, slides were blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-human p65 antibody at a 1:200 dilution. After incubation for 12 h at 4 °C, the slides were washed, incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G at a 1:200 dilution for 1 h, and counterstained for nuclei with 50 ng/ml Hoechst 33342 dye for 5 min. Stained slides were mounted with mounting medium purchased from Sigma and analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Labophot-2; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Pictures were captured using a Photometrics Coolsnap CF color camera (Nikon, Lewisville, TX) and MetaMorph version 4.6.5 software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). Live and Dead Assay—To assess apoptosis, we used the Live and Dead assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), which determines intracellular esterase activity and plasma membrane integrity. This assay employs the green fluorescing polyanionic dye calcein, which is retained within live cells, and the red fluorescing monomer dye ethidium, which enters cells through damaged membranes to bind nucleic acids and is excluded by the intact plasma membrane of live cells. Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were incubated with 250 nm evodiamine for 24 h and then treated with 1 nm TNF for 16 h at 37 °C. Cells were stained with the Live and Dead reagent (5 μm calcein AM and 5 μm ethidium homodimer) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were analyzed under a Labophot-2 fluorescence microscope. Cytotoxicity Assay—The effects of evodiamine on the cytotoxicity of TNF and chemotherapeutic agents were determined by the MTT uptake method as previously described (35Takada Y. Bhardwaj A. Potdar P. Aggarwal B.B. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 9247-9258Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 104 cells were incubated with evodiamine for 24 h in triplicate in a 96-well plate and then treated with 10 nm TNF, 10 μm taxol, or 10 μg/ml cisplatin for 24 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, an MTT solution was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for a further 2 h at 37 °C. Extraction buffer (20% SDS and 50% dimethylformamide) was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h at 37 °C. Optical density was measured at 570 nm using a 96-well multiscanner (MRX Revelation, Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). Annexin V Assay—An early indicator of apoptosis is the rapid translocation and accumulation of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine from the cytoplasmic interface to the extracellular surface. This loss of membrane asymmetry can be detected using the binding properties of annexin V. To detect apoptosis, we used anti-annexin V antibody, which conjugates with the fluorescent dye fluorescein isothiocyanate. Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were treated with 250 nm evodiamine for 24 h and then with 1 nm TNF for 16 h at 37 °C, and subjected to annexin V staining. Cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-annexin V antibody, and analyzed with a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). TUNEL Assay—We also assayed cytotoxicity by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method, which examines DNA strand breaks during apoptosis, using an in situ cell death detection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were treated with evodiamine for 24 h and then with 1 nm TNF for 16 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, cells were trypsinized, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate. After being washed, cells were incubated with reaction mixture for 60 min at 37 °C. Stained cells were analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Invasion Assay—The membrane invasion culture system was used to assess invasion by H1299 cells. Invasion through the extracellular matrix is a crucial step in tumor metastasis. Matrigel basement membrane matrix extracted from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse tumor can be used as a reconstituted basement membrane in vitro and provides a biologically active extracellular matrix for in vitro invasion assays (36Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar). We used the BD BioCoat tumor invasion system (BD Biosciences), the chamber of which has a light-tight polyethylene terephthalate membrane with 8-μm pores and is coated with reconstituted basement membrane gel. Subsequently, 2.5 × 104 cells were resuspended in serum-free media and seeded into the upper wells. After incubation for 12 h, cells were treated with 250 nm evodiamine for an additional 24 h and then stimulated with 1 nm TNF for a further 24 h in the presence of 1% FBS and the evodiamine. The cells that invaded through the Matrigel were labeled with 4 μg/ml calcein AM, incubated in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C, and subjected to scanning for fluorescence with a Victor 3 microplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of evodiamine on the NF-κB activation pathway induced by various carcinogens and inflammatory stimuli and on NF-κB-regulated gene expression. The structure of evodiamine is shown in Fig. 1A. Evodiamine Inhibits NF-κB Activation Induced by Various Carcinogens and Inflammatory Stimuli—TNF, IL-1β, PMA, okadaic acid, H2O2, and cigarette smoke condensate are all potent activators of NF-κB, but they differ in how they activate NF-κB (30Anto R.J.

https://openalex.org/W2140773448,"Environmental light information such as quality, intensity, and duration in red (approximately 660 nm) and far-red (approximately 730 nm) wavelengths is perceived by phytochrome photoreceptors in plants, critically influencing almost all developmental strategies from germination to flowering. Phytochromes interconvert between red light-absorbing Pr and biologically functional far-red light-absorbing Pfr forms. To ensure optimal photoresponses in plants, the flux of light signal from Pfr-phytochromes should be tightly controlled. Phytochromes are phosphorylated at specific serine residues. We found that a type 5 protein phosphatase (PAPP5) specifically dephosphorylates biologically active Pfr-phytochromes and enhances phytochrome-mediated photoresponses. Depending on the specific serine residues dephosphorylated by PAPP5, phytochrome stability and affinity for a downstream signal transducer, NDPK2, were enhanced. Thus, phytochrome photoreceptors have developed an elaborate biochemical tuning mechanism for modulating the flux of light signal, employing variable phosphorylation states controlled by phosphorylation and PAPP5-mediated dephosphorylation as a mean to control phytochrome stability and affinity for downstream transducers."
https://openalex.org/W2033029444,MCM2-7 proteins are replication factors required to initiate DNA synthesis and are currently the best candidates for replicative helicases. We show that the MCM2-7-related protein MCM8 is required to efficiently replicate chromosomal DNA in Xenopus egg extracts. MCM8 does not associate with the soluble MCM2-7 complex and binds chromatin upon initiation of DNA synthesis. MCM8 depletion does not affect replication licensing or MCM3 loading but slows down DNA synthesis and reduces chromatin recruitment of RPA34 and DNA polymerase-α. Recombinant MCM8 displays both DNA helicase and ATPase activities in vitro. Reconstitution experiments show that ATP binding in MCM8 is required to rescue DNA synthesis in MCM8-depleted extracts. MCM8 colocalizes with replication foci and RPA34 on chromatin. We suggest that MCM8 functions in the elongation step of DNA replication as a helicase that facilitates the recruitment of RPA34 and stimulates the processivity of DNA polymerases at replication foci.
https://openalex.org/W2140998787,"B-Raf is a key regulator of the ERK pathway and is mutationally activated in two-thirds of human melanomas. In this work, we have investigated the activation mechanism of B-Raf and characterized the roles of Ras and of B-Raf phosphorylation in this regulation. Raf-1 is regulated by an N-terminal autoinhibitory domain whose actions are blocked by interaction with Ras and subsequent phosphorylation of Ser338. We observed that B-Raf also contains an N-terminal autoinhibitory domain and that the interaction of this domain with the catalytic domain was inhibited by binding to active H-Ras. However, unlike Raf-1, the phosphorylation of B-Raf at Ser445 was constitutive and was only moderately increased by expression of constitutively active H-Ras or constitutively active PAK1. Ser445 phosphorylation is important to the B-Raf activation mechanism, however, because mutation of this site to alanine increased the affinity of the regulatory domain for the catalytic domain and increased autoinhibition. Similarly, expression of constitutively active PAK1 also decreased auto-inhibition. B-Raf autoinhibition was negatively regulated by acidic substitutions at phosphorylation sites within the activation loop of B-Raf and by the oncogenic substitution V599E. However, these substitutions did not affect the ability of the regulatory domain to co-immunoprecipitate with the catalytic domain. These data demonstrate that B-Raf activity is autoregulated, that constitutive phosphorylation of Ser445 primes B-Raf for activation, and that a key feature of phosphorylation within the activation loop or of oncogenic mutations within this region is to block autoinhibition.

They regulate ERK activation through the direct phosphorylation of MEK1 and MEK2, which then phosphorylate and activate ERK1 and ERK2. Once activated, ERKs phosphorylate a large number of cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates that enable Ras to control such diverse processes as cellular proliferation, transformation, and differentiation (5Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers G.T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3526) Google Scholar). The Raf family consists of three isoforms, A-Raf, B-Raf, and Raf-1 (C-Raf), which exhibit a high degree of homology within three conserved regions (CR) known as CR1, CR2, and CR3. CR1 contains a Ras-binding domain (RBD) as well as an adjacent cysteine-rich domain (CRD). CR2 comprises a small region with a conserved Akt phosphorylation site, and CR3 encompasses the catalytic domain. Outside of these regions, Raf proteins exhibit little identity to each other. Raf family members also display different abilities to phosphorylate and activate MEK1 and MEK2, with B-Raf being the most active, followed by Raf-1 and then A-Raf (6Pritchard C.A. Samuels M.L.

In fact, in many cell types, B-Raf appears to constitute the majority of detectable MEK kinase activity (8Jaiswal R.K. Moodie S.A. Wolfman A. Landreth G.E. Mol. Cell.

These findings, coupled with the normal ERK activation kinetics displayed in A-Raf or Raf-1 knockout mice, suggest that B-Raf may be the most important Raf family member in the ERK activation cascade (12Huser M.

Interestingly, >90% of the oncogenic mutations found in B-Raf are accounted for by a single amino acid change of glutamate for valine at residue 599, which renders the kinase constitutively active (17Brose M.S.

In the case of melanoma, such mutations appear to occur early in the development of cancer because the majority of benign nevi also contain activating mutations in the B-raf gene (19Pollock P.M.

These observations, coupled with the finding that mutationally activated ras and B-raf genes generally occur in the same types of cancer and are almost never identified in the same tumors concurrently, underscore the importance of ERK activation to the process of tumorigenesis in select tissues (16Rajagopalan H.

The discovery that a single point mutation can impart full catalytic activity to B-Raf suggests that the activation mechanism of B-Raf is relatively simple and distinct from that of Raf-1 and A-Raf, which cannot be activated in this manner. Wild-type B-Raf activation clearly requires binding to an active small G protein such as Ras or Rap1 (8Jaiswal R.K. Moodie S.A. Wolfman A. Landreth G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6944-6953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Moodie S.A. Paris M.J. Kolch W. Wolfman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7153-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Troppmair J.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5429-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 25Zhang B.H. Guan K.L. Exp. Lung Res. 2001; 27: 269-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These phosphorylation sites are contained within the activation loop of the catalytic domain and are believed to contribute directly to an increase in B-Raf catalytic activity (26Wan P.T. Garnett M.J. Roe S.M. Lee S. Niculescu-Duvaz D. Good V.M. Jones C.M. Marshall C.J. Springer C.J. Barford D. Marais R. Cell. 2004; 116: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2230) Google Scholar). In this respect, the activation requirements of B-Raf are similar to those of Raf-1 because Raf-1 must also bind to Ras and requires phosphorylation of sites within the activation loop of its catalytic domain (Thr491 and Ser494) (27Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, full activation of Raf-1 also requires phosphorylation of Ser338 and Tyr341, which lie outside the catalytic domain and contribute to the Raf-1 activation mechanism by blocking the actions of the autoinhibitory domain (28Tran N.H. Frost J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11221-11226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 29Chong H. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36269-36276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the residues in B-Raf corresponding to Tyr340 and Tyr341 in Raf-1 are substituted with aspartic acids, and Ser445, which corresponds to Ser338 in Raf-1, appears to be constitutively phosphorylated in COS and PC12 cells (30Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). These data suggest either that B-Raf does not contain a functional N-terminal autoinhibitory domain or that its interaction with the catalytic domain is regulated in a manner that is distinct from Raf-1. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism of B-Raf regulation by its N terminus and have characterized the roles of Ras and of phosphorylation of Ser445 in this regulation. We show that the phosphorylation of B-Raf at Ser445 is constitutive, but that expression of constitutively active H-Ras or constitutively active PAK1 can modestly increase the phosphorylation of this site. We have also found that B-Raf contains an N-terminal autoinhibitory domain and that the interaction of this domain with the B-Raf catalytic domain is negatively regulated by binding to active Ras. Autoinhibition is sensitive to the phosphorylation state of Ser445 because mutation of this site to alanine increased the affinity of the autoinhibitory domain for the catalytic domain and increased the level of auto-inhibition observed. On the other hand, the ability of the B-Raf autoinhibitory domain to block ERK2 activation was negatively regulated by acidic amino acid substitutions at the activating phosphorylation sites Thr598 and Ser601 as well as by the oncogenic substitution V599E. These data demonstrate that B-Raf is also regulated by an autoinhibitory mechanism and that the effectiveness of this autoinhibitory domain is blunted by prior phosphorylation of Ser445. This work also suggests that blocking B-Raf autoinhibition is a key mechanistic feature of oncogenic mutations that occur within the activation loop of B-Raf.

B-Raf-(1–435) R187L was produced by PCR using B-Raf-(1–435) as a template. The Myc-tagged B-Raf catalytic domain (B-RafCAT, amino acids 436–765) was amplified with Pfu polymerase and subcloned into pCMV5M. All cDNAs amplified by PCR were sequenced to confirm correct amplification. B-RafCAT S445A, B-RafCAT V599E, B-RafCAT T598A/S601A, and B-RafCAT T598E/S601D were produced by PCR and sequenced to determine correct amplification.

Immunoprecipitations and in Vitro Kinase Assays—HEK 293 cells were transfected with HA-ERK2 (2 μg) with or without the appropriate B-RafCAT (20 ng) or N-terminal expression constructs (varying amounts) by CaPO4 coprecipitation. The next day, the cell medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus penicillin/streptomycin without fetal bovine serum, and the cells were incubated for another 24 h. Cell were then lysed in Triton lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and insoluble material was precipitated by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were stored at –80 °C for later analysis. To measure HA-ERK2 activity, HA-ERK2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using 2 μg of mouse anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and 40 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Precipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of high salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 500 mm NaCl) and once with 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The pellets were separated into two parts, one of which was used to measure HA-ERK2 kinase activity and the other to monitor the amounts HA-ERK2 in the immunoprecipitates by Western blotting. Kinase assays were performed using 10 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP; Sigma) as an ERK2 substrate in a 40-μl reaction. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)). Proteins were then resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were dried, and phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Radioactive phosphate incorporated into MBP was determined by scintillation counting of the excised protein bands. For Western blotting to detect immunoprecipitated HA-ERK2, proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). HA-ERK2 was detected using rabbit anti-ERK2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Active HA-ERK2 was detected by Western blotting using mouse anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAPK antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies). Ras expression was monitored using mouse anti-pan Ras antibody (Oncogene Science Inc.). Raf Isoform Phosphorylation and Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis— To monitor the phosphorylation of endogenous A-Raf, B-Raf, and Raf-1 at the homologous PAK phosphorylation sites (Ser299, Ser445, and Ser338, respectively), HEK 293 cells were serum-starved and then stimulated with human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF; 50 ng/ml; Calbiochem) for different periods of time. Cells were lysed with Triton lysis buffer, and insoluble material was precipitated by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. A-Raf or B-Raf protein was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-A-Raf or rabbit anti-B-Raf antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), respectively, and protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed with three times with 1 ml of high salt buffer and once with 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Phosphorylation of Ser299 or Ser445 was detected by Western blotting using mouse anti-phospho-Ser338 Raf-1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Blots were then reprobed with rabbit anti-A-Raf antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or mouse anti-B-Raf antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) to determine the amount of immunoprecipitated Raf protein. To detect phosphorylation of Raf-1 at Ser338, EGF-stimulated cells were lysed in Triton lysis buffer, and 40 μg of soluble cell lysates in 1× Laemmli sample buffer were loaded onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for Western blot analysis. Total Raf-1 protein was detected using rabbit anti-Raf-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Binding of primary antibodies was detected by incubating blots with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.), and blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. For co-immunoprecipitation analysis, B-RafCAT (1 μg) with or without B-Raf N-terminal constructs (1 μg) was transfected into HEK 293 cells using Lipofectamine Plus. In select experiments, constitutively active PAK1 (100 ng) or constitutively active H-Ras (100 ng) was also included. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h prior to harvest. Cells were lysed in Triton lysis buffer, and insoluble materials were pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. B-RafCAT proteins were immunoprecipitated using mouse anti-Myc antibody and protein A-Sepharose, and immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of Triton wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100) and once with 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with mouse anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) or rabbit anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Regulation of Phosphorylation of A-Raf, B-Raf, and Raf-1 at Ser299, Ser445, and Ser338, Respectively—Raf-1 activation is regulated in part by phosphorylation of Ser338, and substitution of this site with alanine precludes Raf-1 activation by physiologic stimuli (34Diaz B.

Phosphorylation of this site contributes to Raf-1 activation by blocking the ability of the N-terminal autoinhibitory domain to negatively regulate Raf-1 catalytic activity (28Tran N.H. Frost J.A. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 36269-36276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because this residue is conserved among Raf family members (Fig. 1A), we examined whether the corresponding residues in A-Raf and B-Raf (Ser299 and Ser445, respectively) are also phosphorylated in a ligand-dependent manner. Previously, it was shown that transfected B-Raf is constitutively phosphorylated at Ser445 in COS cells and that endogenous B-Raf is highly phosphorylated in cycling PC12 cells (30Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). However, the phosphorylation status of endogenous B-Raf at Ser445 in other cell types has not been reported, nor has the phosphorylation of endogenous or transfected A-Raf at Ser299 been examined. Because treatment of COS cells with EGF stimulates the phosphorylation of Raf-1 at Ser338 (30Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), we first examined whether EGF stimulates the phosphorylation of endogenous A-Raf or B-Raf at the corresponding residues in HEK 293 cells. Cells were treated with EGF for different periods of time and lysed, and the endogenous A-Raf and B-Raf proteins were immunoprecipitated. After immunoprecipitation, the phosphorylation of A-Raf and B-Raf at Ser299 and Ser445 was examined by Western blotting. Phosphorylation of endogenous Raf-1 at Ser338 was monitored by Western blotting without prior immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 1B, addition of EGF stimulated a robust phosphorylation of Raf-1 at Ser338 as early as 1 min after stimulation and lasted past 15 min. This time course corresponds well with the reported activation kinetics of both endogenous and transfected Raf-1 following EGF stimulation and also with the phosphorylation kinetics of transfected Raf-1 at Ser388 in COS cells (40Roy S. McPherson R.A. Apolloni A. Yan J. Lane A. Clyde-Smith J. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 41Chiloeches A. Mason C.S. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2423-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that the phosphorylation of A-Raf at Ser299 was also stimulated by EGF, although the duration of phosphorylation of this site was much shorter than for Raf-1. Thus, by analogy with Raf-1, phosphorylation of this site may play an important role in the A-Raf activation mechanism. On the other hand, endogenous B-Raf was phosphorylated at Ser445 even in the absence of EGF, and the level of Ser445 phosphorylation was not stimulated addition of ligand. Similar results were obtained using a rat monoclonal antibody previously shown to recognize both B-Raf and Raf-1 phosphorylated at Ser445 and Ser338, respectively (data not shown) (30Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Thus, these data correlate well with previous findings demonstrating that transfected B-Raf is constitutively phosphorylated in COS cells (30Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). We then tested whether the phosphorylation of Ser445 could be increased by expression of constitutively active Ras or constitutively active PAK1 because Ras stimulates B-Raf activity and because PAK1 phosphorylates Raf-1 at the analogous site (Ser338) (28Tran N.H. Frost J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11221-11226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 36King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4395-4405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged wild-type B-Raf and increasing amounts of constitutively active Ras (V12H-Ras) or constitutively active PAK1. After serum starvation, B-Raf was immunoprecipitated and tested for phosphorylation of Ser445 by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1C (lane 2), transfected B-Raf exhibited a high degree of Ser445 phosphorylation, similar to endogenous B-Raf (Fig. 1B). However, expression of active Ras did stimulate a modest increase in this phosphorylation (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 3–5 with lane 2). On the other hand, constitutively active PAK1 was more effective at stimulating Ser445 phosphorylation (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 2 and 5). This indicates that the phosphorylation of B-Raf at Ser445 in serum-starved cells is not maximal, and indicates that Ras stimulates the phosphorylation of this site. It also suggests that PAK1 is a potential B-Raf kinase. The B-Raf N Terminus Contains an Autoinhibitory Domain— Raf-1 contains an autoinhibitory domain that minimally encompasses residues 1–147 and that includes the entire RBD and part of the CRD. We have shown previously that coexpression of this domain with the catalytic domain of Raf-1 blocks its ability to stimulate ERK2 activation (28Tran N.H. Frost J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11221-11226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether B-Raf also contains an autoinhibitory domain in its N terminus. We first examined whether expression of the B-Raf catalytic domain (B-RafCAT, amino acids 436–765) would stimulate ERK2"

Although uncoupling from heterotrimeric G-proteins, which transiently arrests signaling, is well described, little is known about the mechanisms that permanently arrest signaling. Here we reported on the mechanisms that terminate signaling by protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), which mediated the proinflammatory and nociceptive actions of proteases. Given its irreversible mechanism of proteolytic activation, PAR2 is a model to study the permanent arrest of GPCR signaling. By immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, we observed that activated PAR2 was mono-ubiquitinated. Immunofluorescence indicated that activated PAR2 translocated from the plasma membrane to early endosomes and lysosomes where it was degraded, as determined by immunoblotting. Mutant PAR2 lacking intracellular lysine residues (PAR2Δ14K/R) was expressed at the plasma membrane and signaled normally but was not ubiquitinated. Activated PAR2 Δ14K/R internalized but was retained in early endosomes and avoided lysosomal degradation. Activation of wild type PAR2 stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase c-Cbl and promoted its interaction with PAR2 at the plasma membrane and in endosomes in an Src-dependent manner. Dominant negative c-Cbl lacking the ring finger domain inhibited PAR2 ubiquitination and induced retention in early endosomes, thereby impeding lysosomal degradation. Although wild type PAR2 was degraded, and recovery of agonist responses required synthesis of new receptors, lysine mutation and dominant negative c-Cbl impeded receptor ubiquitination and degradation and allowed PAR2 to recycle and continue to signal. Thus, c-Cbl mediated ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of PAR2 to irrevocably terminate signaling by this and perhaps other GPCRs.

Covalent attachment of the polypeptide ubiquitin affects the location and function of many proteins (1Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Three classes of enzyme are required for this attachment. A ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 uses ATP to form ubiquitin C-terminal adenylate, a substrate for formation of a E1-ubiquitin thiol ester. Activated ubiquitin is passed to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes E2. The ubiquitin ligase E3 1The abbreviations used are: E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; PAR2, protease-activated receptor 2; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; RTKs, receptor tyrosine kinases; wt, wild type; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; PAF, platelet-activating factor; FRT, Flp recombination target; HEK, human embryonic kidney cells; β2AR, β2 adrenergic receptor; AP, activating peptide; RP, reverse peptide; ZPAD, Z-Phe-Ala-diazomethylketone. attaches the C terminus of ubiquitin to the ϵ-amino lysines of target proteins. There are many hundreds of E3 ligases that specifically interact with target proteins to provide selectivity. Attachment of single ubiquitin molecules to one or more lysines, known as mono-ubiquitination or multimono-ubiquitination, determines the trafficking and subcellular localization of proteins (1Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). In addition, ubiquitin itself can be ubiquitinated at one of its three lysines, allowing ubiquitin chains to be added to target proteins. These polyubiquitinated proteins are usually targeted for degradation in proteasomes (2Pickart C.M. Cell. 2004; 116: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) plays an important role in terminating signaling (3Dikic I. Giordano S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Several overlapping mechanisms arrest signaling of activated receptors either transiently or permanently. The transient mechanisms of signal arrest, which reversibly inhibit signaling, have been extensively investigated, and the molecular mechanisms are thoroughly characterized. These mechanisms include dephosphorylation of RTKs such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by protein-tyrosine phosphatases (4Haj F.G. Verveer P.J. Squire A. Neel B.G. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2002; 295: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of GPCRs such as the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) by G-protein receptor kinases followed by association with β-arrestins, which uncouples GPCRs from heterotrimeric G-proteins (5Benovic J.L. DeBlasi A. Stone W.C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1989; 246: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 6Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Far less is known about the permanent mechanisms of signal arrest that irreversibly terminate signaling. The E3 ligase c-Cbl mediates agonist-stimulated ubiquitination of several RTKs, which is required for receptor trafficking and lysosomal degradation (7Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S.

Cell. 2001; 8: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms that permanently arrest signaling by GPCRs are less well understood. Agonists induce ubiquitination of the GPCRs Ste2p and Ste3p in yeast and β2AR and chemokine receptor CXCR4 in mammalian cells, which is required for various steps of receptor trafficking and degradation (15Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 16Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J.

However, receptor ubiquitination is not required for lysosomal trafficking of all GPCRs (19Tanowitz M. Von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50219-50222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and some GPCRs, such as the platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor, are ubiquitinated in the absence of agonist (20Dupre D.J.

Moreover, the E3 ligases that mediate agonist-stimulated ubiquitination of GPCRs are unknown, with the exception of CXCR4, where AIP4 mediates ubiquitination (21Marchese A. Raiborg C. Santini F. Keen J.H. Stenmark H. Benovic J.L. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 709-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). We investigated the mechanism and function of ubiquitination of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), which mediates the biological actions of certain serine proteases derived from epithelial cells, inflammatory cells, and the circulation. Trypsin, mast cell tryptase, and coagulation factors VIIa and Xa cleave PAR2 within the extracellular N-terminal domain to expose a tethered ligand that binds to and activates the cleaved receptor (22Ossovskaya V.S. Bunnett N.W. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 579-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Compared with most GPCRs, which bind to agonists in a reversible manner, there are certain unusual aspects of the mechanism of PAR activation that present a unique challenge to the cell. Proteases activate PARs by irreversible cleavage, so that cleaved receptors cannot be reactivated by proteolysis, and thus would not be expected to recycle. However, once cleaved, the exposed tethered ligand is always available to interact with the cleaved receptor, which could result in sustained signaling unless there were efficient mechanisms of signal arrest. Transient mechanisms that arrest PAR2 signaling include receptor phosphorylation and association with β-arrestins (23Bohm S.K. Khitin L.M. Grady E.F. Aponte G. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol.

However, β-arrestins recruit extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) to PAR2 in endosomes, allowing the endocytosed receptor to continue to signal (25DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S.

KNRK-FLP cells (created with the Flp-In™ system according to the manufacturer's guidelines) and HEK293-FLP cells (Invitrogen) were maintained in medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml Zeocin. These are isogenic cell lines with an Flp recombination target (FRT) site. Stable cell lines were created by cotransfection with pcDNA5/FRT and pOG44, a vector that transiently expresses the Flp recombinase (Invitrogen). Cells were placed in medium containing 300 μg/ml (KNRK) or 50 μg/ml (HEK) hygromycin B for selection. After 7–10 days, PAR2 expression was assessed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence (23Bohm S.K. Khitin L.M. Grady E.F. Aponte G. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol.

KNRK cells expressing PAR2 were transfected with c-Cbl or ΔRFc-Cbl using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were placed in 800 μg/ml neomycin, and colonies were picked after 1–2 weeks, and expression of c-Cbl was examined by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Clonal cell lines were maintained in medium containing 400 μg/ml neomycin and 150 μg/ml hygromycin B. In control experiments, KNRK or HEK cells expressing vectors without inserts were studied. Activation of PAR2 and Drug Treatments—Cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin or 5% HIFBS. To activate PAR2 specifically, cells were challenged with PAR2-activating peptide (AP, SLIGRL-NH2, Sigma Genosys, The Woodlands, TX, or Bachem, Torrance, CA), a synthetic peptide corresponding to the tethered ligand domain of PAR2 (SLIGRL) that selectively activates the receptor in KNRK-PAR2 and HEK-PAR2 cells (23Bohm S.K.

Bovine pancreatic trypsin (Worthington) was used as a physiological agonist. Control experiments used the reverse sequence of AP (reverse peptide (RP), LRGILS-NH2, Sigma Genosys) or heat-inactivated trypsin (5 min, 100 °C). To inhibit lysosomal or proteasomal proteases, cells were preincubated with 100 μm ZPAD (Bachem, Torrance, CA) or 10 μm epoxomicin (Biomol International, Plymouth Meeting, PA), respectively, for 30 min prior to stimulation with AP, and inhibitors were included in the buffer throughout the experiments. Cells were preincubated with cycloheximide (70 μm) to inhibit new protein synthesis, brefeldin A (1 μm) to disrupt the Golgi apparatus, PP2 (1 μm) to inhibit Src kinase, or AG1478 tyrphostin (20 μm) to inhibit EGFR (all Calbiochem) for 30 min before AP. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, boiled, and cleared by centrifugation. Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE (9% acrylamide) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P or FL, Millipore, Billerica, MA), and membranes were blocked with 100 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0–2% bovine serum albumin, 0–5% nonfat milk powder, 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (FLAG M1, 1:2,000; HA11, 1:5,000; c-Cbl, 1:1,000; phosphotyrosine, 1:1,000; ubiquitin P4D1, 1:5,000; ubiquitin FK1, 1:5,000; and γ-tubulin, 1:5,000, overnight at 4 °C). Membranes were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000,1hat room temperature). Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate, Pierce; ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences). Alternatively, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to AlexaFluor 680 or IRDye 800 (1:20,000 1 h at room temperature). Blots were analyzed using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LiCor, Lincoln, NE). To remove N-linked oligosaccharides and O-linked sugars of PAR2, cell extracts were treated with the Enzymatic CarboRelease kit according to the manufacturer's directions (QABio, San Mateo, CA). Immunoprecipitation—For denaturing immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, boiled, mixed with 2 volumes of RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS), reboiled, and centrifuged. For nondenaturing immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in RIPA containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, 1 tablet in 50 ml) and centrifuged. Supernatants (1.5 ml) were rotated with immunoprecipitating antibodies (HA11, 250 ng; T7, 500 ng; c-Cbl, 1 μg) for 3–16 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G PLUS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added (30 μl), and samples were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were pelleted, washed with RIPA, boiled in Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. Densitometry—Blots were digitized using an Epson Perfection 3200 PHOTO scanner and analyzed by densitometry with NIH Image 1.63. Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (20 min at 4 °C), washed, and incubated with primary antibodies (SAM11, 1:100; HA11, 1:1,000; T7, 1:1,600; EEA1, 1:500; LAMP1, 1:1,200, overnight at 4 °C) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% saponin and 1–2% goat or donkey serum. Cells were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas Red (1:200, 2 h at room temperature). To examine PAR2 recycling, live cells were incubated with M2 antibody to the extracellular FLAG epitope (10 μg/ml, 2 h at 4 °C), followed by AP at 37 °C to induce PAR2 trafficking. At various times cells were fixed, and FLAG M2 was localized by immunofluorescence as described. Cells were observed using a Zeiss Axiovert microscope and a Bio-Rad MRC 1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope, with a Zeiss PlanApochromat ×100 oil immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.3) (23Bohm S.K.

Images were assembled, and the brightness and contrast of images were adjusted using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems). Single optical sections are shown. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—Cells were washed, incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing Ca2+ and Mg2+, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with 2.5 μm fura-2AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, 20 min at 37 °C), and washed, and fluorescence was measured at 340 and 380 nm excitation and 510 nm emission in a F-2500 spectrophotometer (Hitachi Instruments, Irvine, CA) (23Bohm S.K.

The ratio of the fluorescence at the two excitation wavelengths, which is proportional to [Ca2+]i, was calculated. Maximal increases in [Ca2+]i above basal were determined. Statistics—Results are mean ± S.E. of n ≥ 3 experiments and were compared by analysis of variance and Bonferroni t test (multiple comparisons) or Student's t test (two comparisons), with p < 0.05 (* or †), p < 0.01 (** or ††), or p < 0.001 (*** or †††) considered significant. PAR2 Agonists Induce Ubiquitination of the Receptor—To examine agonist-stimulated ubiquitination of PAR2, KNRK cells expressing human PAR2 (designated KNRK-PAR2 cells) were exposed to PAR2 AP, which selectively activates this receptor. PAR2 was immunoprecipitated under denaturing conditions using an antibody to the T7 epitope, and membranes were probed for ubiquitin with P4D1 antibody, which interacts with mono- and polyubiquitin (10Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), and for PAR2 with antibody to the FLAG epitope. In unstimulated cells, a low level of PAR2 ubiquitination was detected (Fig. 2a, 0 min). AP (100 μm) induced the appearance of ubiquitinated proteins with apparent molecular masses of ∼70–220 kDa within 15 min, and ubiquitination was sustained for at least 60 min (Fig. 2a). Reprobing membranes for PAR2 using the FLAG antibody confirmed similar levels of loading in all experiments (Fig. 2a). The FLAG antibody detected PAR2 with an apparent molecular mass of ∼55–110 kDa. There was some overlap with the mass of ubiquitinated receptor (∼70–220 kDa), indicating that a portion of PAR2 detected with the FLAG antibody is ubiquitinated. The natural PAR2 agonist trypsin (10 nm) also induced ubiquitination of the receptor in a similar manner to AP (not shown). RP and boiled trypsin, which do not activate PAR2, had no effect on receptor ubiquitination (not shown). There were no detectable signals for ubiquitin or PAR2 in KNRK cells expressing vector without insert, which confirms specificity of detection (Fig. 2a). To assess whether PAR2 was polyubiquitinated, we immunoprecipitated PAR2 and probed membranes using the FK1 ubiquitin antibody, which interacts only with polyubiquitin (10Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). AP-induced PAR2 ubiquitination was not detected by using FK1 ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 2b). However, both P4D1 and FK1 antibodies recognized multiple proteins in lysates of KNRK-PAR2 cells and are thus capable of interacting with ubiquitinated proteins in these cells (Fig. 2c). The FK1 antibody interacted with proteins of higher molecular weight than the P4D1 antibody, possibly because FK1 interacts only with polyubiquitinated proteins (10Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Together, our data show that agonists induce mono-ubiquitination of PAR2 either at one or, more likely, several sites. To determine whether PAR2 is ubiquitinated at the cell surface or in endosomes, we examined KNRK cells expressing PAR2ΔST363/6A, a mutant that signals but does not internalize (25DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). AP stimulated ubiquitination of PAR2ΔST363/6A (Fig. 2d), suggesting that PAR2 can be ubiquitinated even if it is retained at the plasma membrane. However, the ubiquitinated forms of PAR2ΔST363/6A appeared to be larger than for the native receptor. The reason for this difference is not known. Activated PAR2 Is Targeted to Lysosomes and Degraded— Because mono-ubiquitination can direct proteins to lysosomes (1Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), we examined agonist-induced degradation of PAR2. KNRK-PAR2 cells were incubated with AP (100 μm, 0–5 h) in the presence of cycloheximide to prevent new protein synthesis, and membranes were probed for PAR2 by using an antibody to the FLAG epitope or for γ-tubulin as a control for load"
https://openalex.org/W1963599691,"SifA is a Salmonella effector protein that is required for maintenance of the vacuolar membrane that surrounds replicating bacteria. It associates with the Salmonella-containing vacuole but how it interacts with the membrane is unknown. Here we show by immunofluorescence, S100 fractionation and Triton X-114 partitioning that the membrane association and targeting properties of SifA are influenced by a motif encoded within the C-terminal six amino acids. This sequence shares homology with both CAAX and Rab geranylgeranyl transferase prenylation motifs. We characterized the post-translational processing of SifA and showed that the cysteine residue within the CAAX motif is modified by isoprenoid addition through the action of protein geranylgeranyl transferase I. SifA was additionally modified by S-acylation of an adjacent cysteine residue. Similar modifications to host cell proteins regulate numerous functions including protein targeting, membrane association, protein-protein interaction, and signal transduction. This is the only known example of a bacterial effector protein that is modified both by mammalian cell S-acylation and prenylation machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1995946739,"Inhibitors of Complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, such as rotenone, promote Parkinson disease-like symptoms and signs of oxidative stress. Dopamine (DA) oxidation products may be implicated in such a process. We show here that the o-quinone dopaminochrome (DACHR), a relatively stable DA oxidation product, promotes concentration (0.1–0.2 μm)- and respiration-dependent generation of H2O2 at Complex I in brain mitochondria, with further stimulation by low concentrations of rotenone (5–30 nm). The rotenone effect required that contaminating Ca2+ (8–10 μm) was not removed. DACHR apparently extracts an electron from the constitutively autoxidizable site in Complex I, producing a semiquinone, which then transfers an electron to O2, generating O2−˙ and then H2O2. Mitochondrial removal of H2O2 monoamine, formed by either oxidase activity or DACHR, was performed largely by glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase, which were negatively regulated by low intramitochondrial Ca2+ levels. Thus, the H2O2 formed accumulated in the medium if contaminating Ca2+ was present; in the absence of Ca2+, H2O2 was completely removed if it originated from monoamine oxidase, but was less completely removed if it originated from DACHR. We propose that the primary action of rotenone is to promote extracellular O2−˙ release via activation of NADPH oxidase in the microglia. In turn, O2−˙ oxidizes DA to DACHR extracellularly. (The reaction is favored by the lack of GSH, which would otherwise preferably produce GSH adducts of dopaminoquinone.) Once formed, DACHR (which is resistant to GSH) enters neurons to activate the rotenone-stimulated redox cycle described.

Parkinson disease (PD) 1The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson disease; DA, dopamine; MPP+, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium; MPTP, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; MAO, monoamine oxidase; DAQ, dopaminoquinone; DACHR, dopaminochrome; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; TPEN, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine. is one of the major human neurodegenerative disorders and is clinically characterized by resting tremors, rigidity, slowness of voluntary movement, and postural instability. The neuropathological hallmark of PD is the progressive loss of the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA)-containing neurons, the cell bodies of which are in the substantia nigra pars compacta and nerve terminals in the striatum (1Forno L.S. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 2Hornykiewicz O. Neurology. 1998; 51: S2-S9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lewy bodies are characteristic aggregates that form in affected cells, and increasing evidence suggests that α-synuclein, ubiquitin, and iron constitute a major fraction of Lewy body aggregates (3Kaur D. Andersen J.K. Aging Cell. 2002; 1: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Defects in mitochondrial Complex I activity and DA deficiency have been detected in patients suffering from the disease (4Parker Jr., W.D. Boyson S.J. Parks J.K. Ann. Neurol. 1989; 26: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 5Fahan S. Przedborski S. Rowland L.P. Merritt's Neurology.

Mitochondrial Complex I inhibitors such as 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), a metabolic product of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), and rotenone have been shown to induce symptoms similar to those of PD in experimental animals and humans (7Schmidt N. Ferger B. J. Neural. Transm. 2001; 108: 1263-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 8Sherer T.B. Betarbet R. Stout A.K. Lund S. Baptista M. Panov A.V. Cookson M.R. Greenamyre J.T. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7006-7015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several in vitro studies using MPP+ and rotenone have shown that these compounds can induce oxidative stress, apoptosis, and other biochemical changes similar to those observed in patients afflicted with idiopathic PD (9Fiskum G. Starkov A. Polster B.M. Chinopoulos C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 991: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 10Hartley A. Stone J.M. Heron C. Cooper J.M. Schapira A.H. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1987-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The conversion of MPTP to MPP+ is a complex process that is required for toxicity and that is catalyzed by monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B, localized in non-DA glial cells, followed by spontaneous oxidation to MPP+ (11Chiba K. Peterson L.A. Castagnoli K.P. Trevor A.J. Castagnoli Jr., N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1985; 13: 342-347PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kitahama K. Denney R.M. Maeda T. Jouvet M. Neuroscience. 1991; 44: 185-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The latter is taken up by DA neurons via the DA transporter and is concentrated by an active process in mitochondria (13Vila M. Przedborski S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 1-11Crossref Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Rotenone needs no specific transport mechanism. It is the classical Complex I inhibitor that indiscriminately affects respiration in every cell type. However, its low specificity is accompanied by the striking specificity of the pathology following its slow infusion, which includes degeneration of the substantia nigra pars compacta neurons accompanied by the formation of inclusions similar to authentic Lewy bodies (14Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2958) Google Scholar). It therefore appears that some link must exist between the presence of the neurotransmitter DA and mitochondrial Complex I inhibitors for the development of toxicity. Oxidative stress appears to contribute to the neurodegeneration observed in PD (8Sherer T.B. Betarbet R. Stout A.K. Lund S. Baptista M. Panov A.V. Cookson M.R. Greenamyre J.T. J.

Brains of PD patients have decreased levels of GSH and exhibit oxidative damage to DNA, lipids, and protein (18Pearce R.K. Owen A. Daniel S. Jenner P. Marsden C.D. Neural Transm. 1997; 104: 661-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 19Floor E. Wetzel M.G. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species responsible for damage are supposed to be produced during DA metabolism or oxidative phosphorylation (20Lotharius J. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38581-38588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Normal O2-consuming metabolic processes (e.g. the mitochondrial electron transport chain and the oxidative deamination of DA by MAO) and nonenzymatic autoxidation of DA are believed to result in intraneuronal formation of O2−˙ and H2O2. (21Spencer J.P.E. Jenner P. Daniel S.E. Lees A.J. Marsden D.C. Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2112-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Like all catecholamines, DA is easily oxidizable. O2−˙ promptly accepts an electron from DA, which is transformed into the o-semiquinone radical; two such radicals disproportionate, generating the o-quinone dopaminoquinone (DAQ) plus DA. The unstable DAQ undergoes spontaneous 1,4-intramolecular cyclization and further oxidation, eventually forming the relatively stable dopaminochrome (DACHR) (see Scheme 1) (21Spencer J.P.E. Jenner P. Daniel S.E. Lees A.J. Marsden D.C. Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2112-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 22Bindoli A. Rigobello M.P. Deeble D.J. Free Radic. Biol.

The similar reaction sequence of the catecholamine adrenaline with O2−˙ is extremely fast, and the production of adrenochrome has been used as a method for measuring O2−˙ (24Misra H.P. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3170-3175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, DA forms DACHR upon interaction with peroxynitrite or other oxidants. Of note, DA oxidation to DAQ and then to DACHR can be performed by the peroxidase component of cyclooxygenase, with the electron acceptor being prostaglandin H2 or also H2O2 (25Hastings T.G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). When a thiol like GSH is present at the site of DAQ formation, a nucleophilic addition of the thiol at C-5 of DAQ takes place (see Scheme 1). This reaction prevails over the intramolecular cyclization (26Tse D.C.S. McCreery R.L. Adams R.N. J. Med. Chem. 1976; 19: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Neuromelanin, the dark pigment that accumulates with age in the substantia nigra, is the product of DA oxidation processes induced primarily by DAQ. Analysis of its composition indicates that it is formed in part from compounds originating from the interaction of DAQ with cellular GSH, leading to 5-S-thiol derivatives (mainly 5-S-cysteine, which is formed by degradation of the GSH adduct) (21Spencer J.P.E.

This is what is expected from the facile interaction of DAQ with GSH. However, ∼50% of neuromelanin derives from cyclization products (i.e. from DACHR-like species) (27Carstam R. Brinck C. Hindemith-Augustsson A. Rorsman H. Rosengren E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1097: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 28Odh G. Carstam R. Paulson J. Wittbjer A. Rosengren E.

As noted, such compounds have to originate from a cellular location where GSH is not present at sufficiently high concentrations. This observation is a strong indication that DACHR is formed in vivo. The mechanism by which DA metabolites may be involved in reactive oxygen species generation is, however, not fully elucidated, and the molecular basis for facilitation of reactive oxygen species production in DA-containing neurons is not established. In this study, we report that the interaction between DACHR and respiring brain mitochondria generates H2O2. We show that DACHR dose-dependently increases the production of H2O2 constitutively observed at Complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and that the presence of very low, marginally inhibitory concentrations of the Complex I inhibitor rotenone further increase peroxide production. We also report on Ca2+ control of H2O2 generation and removal. The relevance of these results in the pathogenesis of PD is discussed. Reagents—Amplex Red (10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine) was from Molecular Probes, Inc. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (grade I; EC 1.11.1.7) was from Roche Applied Science. Mushroom tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) and were pargyline from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Preparation of Rat Brain Mitochondria—Brain mitochondria were prepared as described (29Zoccarato F. Cavallini L. Alexandre A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4166-4174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Specifically, the cerebral cortices of two 6–7-week-old rats were rapidly removed into 20 ml of ice-cold isolation medium (320 mm sucrose, 5 mm MOPS, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.05 mm EGTA, pH 7.3) and homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged at 900 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 8500 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of isolation medium. This was layered on a discontinuous gradient consisting of 4 ml of 6% Ficoll, 1.5 ml of 9% Ficoll, and 4 ml of 12% Ficoll (all prepared in isolation medium) and centrifuged at 75,000 × g for 30 min. The myelin, synaptosomal, and free mitochondrial fractions formed above the 6% layer, as a doublet within the 9% layer, and as a pellet, respectively. The pellet was resuspended in 250 mm sucrose and 10 mm K-MOPS, pH 7.2, and centrifuged at 8500 × g for 15 min before being resuspended in this last medium to 10–20 mg of protein/ml by the Gornall protein assay. The mitochondria were well coupled as judged by the increase in the oxygen consumption rate upon addition of ADP (respiratory control ratio), which was between 3.5 and 6 with glutamate and malate as substrates. Oxygen Consumption—Oxygen consumption was monitored with a Clark-type oxygen electrode in a 1.6-ml closed chamber thermostatted at 30 °C with continuous stirring (30Estabrook R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 41-47Crossref Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). Standard Incubation Method—Mitochondria (0.4–0.7 mg/ml) were incubated at 30 °C in 125 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 500 μg/ml defatted bovine serum albumin, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2 (adjusted with KOH), and 40 μm pargyline (an MAO inhibitor). Further additions were as specified in the figure legends. DACHR Generation—DACHR was generated in the test cuvette by incubating variable amounts of DA with tyrosinase (44 units/ml) for 5 min prior to the addition of mitochondria (31Berman S.B. Hastings T.G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1127-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The reaction proceeded without the liberation of reactive oxygen species, leading to the quantitative generation of DACHR as determined by the consumption of 2.0 nanoatoms of oxygen/nmol of DA and the appearance of typical absorbance at 470 nm (molar extinction coefficient of 3.24 × 103) (Scheme 1) (28Odh G. Carstam R. Paulson J. Wittbjer A. Rosengren E. Rorsman H. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 2030-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 32Cooksey C.J. Garratt P.J. Land E.J. Pavel S. Ramsden C.A. Riley P.A. Smit N.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26226-26235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). It is shown that DA is oxidized by tyrosinase to DAQ, which readily undergoes irreversible spontaneous 1,4-intramolecular cyclization to give 5,6-dihydroxyindoline (leuco-DACHR), which in turn is oxidized to DACHR by one molecule of DAQ. Alternatively, the interaction of DA with tyrosinase was induced in the presence of 50 μm GSH. Under these conditions, the high reactivity of DAQ with the thiol led to the quantitative formation of the GSH adduct at C-5 (5-S-glutathionyldopamine) as evidenced by the consumption of only 1 atom of oxygen/molecule of DA and the absence of an absorbance increase at 470 nm (Scheme 1). In our experiments, the formation of DACHR was conducted in the presence of bovine serum albumin, which decreased the yield of DACHR by 20–25%, probably due to interaction of the thiols in bovine serum albumin with DAQ. The concentration of DACHR under each experimental condition was determined by the absorbance at 470 nm. Hydrogen Peroxide Measurements—5 μm Amplex Red and 15 μg/ml HRP (3.75 units) were included in the incubations. H2O2 was detected by the formation of the fluorescent Amplex Red oxidation product resorufin using excitation and emission wavelengths of 563 and 587 nm, respectively, on a Shimadzu RL-5000 spectrofluorometer in a stirred cuvette thermostatted at 30 °C (33Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). The H2O2 calibration scale is linear in the 0–6 μm range, and at the end of each assay, traces were calibrated by the addition of H2O2 (500 pmol). As shown in Fig. 1, H2O2 was generated by brain mitochondria respiring on the NAD-linked substrates glutamate and malate. The release rate was low and could be reliably detected only with the high sensitivity reagent Amplex Red. H2O2 production is to be ascribed to autoxidation of some redox component within Complex I (generating O2−˙, which is then transformed by superoxide dismutase into H2O2) located on the substrate side of the rotenone inhibition site as evidenced by stimulation of peroxide release induced by fully inhibitory rotenone concentrations (data not shown) (34Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 35Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 36Starkov A.A. Fiskum G. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). DACHR (3.6 μm) induced a strong long lasting potentiation of H2O2 generation. The DACHR effect was almost completely eliminated in the absence of substrates (and with some malonate to minimize the oxidation of endogenous substrates). With substrates and DACHR, an additional large increase in H2O2 production was induced by a very low concentration of rotenone (15 nm), which only marginally inhibited respiration (see below) and was almost without effect on H2O2 release in the absence of DACHR. The DACHR potentiation of H2O2 release was visible at concentrations as low as 0.1–0.2 μm and increased essentially linearly with DACHR (Fig. 2A). Concentrations in excess of 10 μm were not tested as they were likely of no physiological significance. 15 nm rotenone was stimulatory at all DACHR concentrations tested, and the potentiation of H2O2 output was also linear. The effect of increasing rotenone concentrations (up to 30 nm) at a fixed DACHR concentration is shown in Fig. 2B. In this concentration range, rotenone only very slightly increased H2O2 production in the absence of DACHR. The rotenone potentiation of H2O2 release was visible at <5 nm. Fig. 2C shows the dose-response inhibition by rotenone of mitochondrial respiration. The H2O2 production rate at a fixed DACHR concentration as a function of substrate concentration and the effect of rotenone (15 nm) are shown in Fig. 2D. Rotenone stimulation was slightly more evident at the lower substrate concentrations.Fig. 2Effect of increasing DACHR, rotenone, and substrate concentrations on H2O2 generation.

In C, data points from a single experiment are representative of at least four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the experiments described above, the Ca2+ contamination of the incubation mixture (8–10 μm) was not removed. When such contaminating Ca2+ was removed by EGTA, the constitutive H2O2 production and the stimulated release induced by DACHR were essentially unchanged. However, rotenone stimulation was less evident (Fig. 2B). The decreased rotenone effect in the presence of EGTA was not due to a variation of the inhibitory potency of rotenone on respiration (Fig. 2C) and appeared to depend solely on the removal of free Ca2+, which does not mimic the heavy metal chelator TPEN (15–30 μm) or the iron chelator deferoxamine (15 μm) (data not shown). Adding small amounts of Ca2+ to the incubation medium (with EGTA omitted) did not increase the rotenone effect further (data not shown). DACHR- and MAO-dependent Production of Peroxide and Its Removal by Mitochondria: Effect of Ca2+—The results presented above were obtained by monitoring H2O2 as soon as it formed with the high affinity trap Amplex Red/HRP. Such a situation does not exist in vivo, where mitochondrially produced H2O2 has access to cellular peroxidases, notably the mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase. Regeneration of GSH is via glutathione reductase, which utilizes NADPH produced by the energy-dependent transhydrogenase. We recently reported that this system is under the control of intramitochondrial Ca2+, which acts as an inhibitor of both glutathione reductase (maximal inhibition of 70%, EC50 = 0.9 μm Ca2+) and glutathione peroxidase (maximum inhibition of 40%, EC50 = 0.9 μm Ca2+) (29Zoccarato F. Cavallini L. Alexandre A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4166-4174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Such Ca2+-mediated control of H2O2 removal was evident when we analyzed the ability of mitochondria to dispose of H2O2 generated by MAO (which is located at the outer mitochondrial membrane) using DA as the substrate (Table I). First, H2O2 production was measured for 5 min in the continuous presence of the Amplex Red/HRP trap. It was unaffected by the presence of respiratory substrates or EGTA. The accumulation of H2O2 in the medium, which represents the balance between H2O2 production and removal, was then measured using the H2O2 detection system after a 5-min incubation. The highest levels of accumulated H2O2 were observed in the absence of respiratory substrates. With substrates, residual H2O2 greatly decreased. However, substantial H2O2 was still detected in the suspension medium if EGTA was omitted, whereas no residual H2O2 was measurable with EGTA, in line with the notion that Ca2+ negatively controls H2O2 removal.Table IMAO-dependent production of H2O2 and its Ca2+-controlled removal by glutathione reductase/glutathione peroxidaseH2O2TrappedAccumulatednmol released per 5 min/mgDA, malonate, ±EGTA6.85 ± 0.104.05 ± 0.10DA, glutamate/malate7.00 ± 0.152.19 ± 0.15DA, EGTA, glutamate/malate7.10 ± 0.10≤0.05 Open table in a new tab To address the relationship between production and removal of H2O2 when the latter originates from DACHR redox cycling, we performed a series of experiments with DACHR in which we monitored the intrinsic rate of H2O2 production using the Amplex Red/HRP trap and compared it with the accumulated H2O2 in the suspension medium as determined by adding the Amplex Red/HRP detection system at a fixed time (5 min) of the reaction (Table II). As described above (Fig. 2), trap measurements with glutamate/malate showed a strong stimulation of peroxide production by DACHR, which was further increased by rotenone in the absence of EGTA. Residual H2O2 accumulation in the suspension medium was relatively high in the absence of EGTA without and especially with rotenone, suggesting that the peroxidase activity was not sufficient to dispose of all the H2O2 produced. In the presence of EGTA, accumulated H2O2 was greatly reduced. However, a small measurable accumulation of residual H2O2 was consistently detectable, suggesting that the H2O2 removal was not as efficient as with MAO-derived H2O2 (Table I). In the presence of ADP, which decreases the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) (State 3), the DACHR-induced authentic peroxide production (measured with the trap) was generally lower. This was particularly evident when EGTA was present: under these conditions, H2O2 production was the lowest, and no H2O2 accumulation was detected. Without EGTA, H2O2 production rates in State 3 were closer to those measured with no ADP (State 4) in both the absence and presence of rotenone. Under these conditions, H2O2 accumulation was evident as expected; it was lower than without ADP.Table IIDACHR-dependent production of H2O2 and its Ca2+ -controlled removal by glutathione reductase/glutathione peroxidaseH2O2State 4State 3TrappedAccumulatedTrappedAccumulatednmol released per 5 min/mgEGTA−Glutamate/malate0.44 ± 0.10≤0.050.27 ± 0.05≤0.05−Glutamate/malate, DACHR2.25 ± 0.150.55 ± 0.101.95 ± 0.100.50 ± 0.05−Glutamate/malate, DACHR, rotenone3.90 ± 0.151.33 ± 0.103.10 ± 0.100.90 ± 0.05+Glutamate/malate0.41 ± 0.15ND0.17 ± 0.05ND+Glutamate/malate, DACHR2.40 ± 0.200.15 ± 0.050.80 ± 0.10≤0.05+Glutamate/malate, DACHR, rotenone2.65 ± 0.200.23 ± 0.050.95 ± 0.10≤0.05−Glutamate/malate, succinate0.70 ± 0.100.10 ± 0.050.50 ± 0.05≤0.05−Glutamate/malate, succinate, DACHR3.06 ± 0.150.90 ± 0.052.41 ± 0.100.50 ± 0.05−Glutamate/malate, succinate, DACHR, rotenone4.26 ± 0.101.70 ± 0.052.73 ± 0.100.70 ± 0.05+Glutamate/malate, succinate2.05 ± 0.05≤0.050.43 ± 0.05≤0.05+Glutamate/malate, succinate, DACHR6.96 ± 0.151.27 ± 0.100.79 ± 0.05≤0.05+Glutamate/malate, succinate, DACHR, rotenone7.22 ± 0.151.36 ± 0.051.22 ± 0.05≤0.05 Open table in a new tab Succinate is a powerful generator of O2−˙/H2O2 in mitochondria under some very specific metabolic conditions. H2O2 production with succinate, which depends on reverse electron transfer from Complex II (the electron carrier from succinate to coenzyme Q) back to Complex I, requires the Δψ to be high and is extremely sensitive to even small decreases in the potential (it is completely removed in State 3) (29Zoccarato F. Cavallini L. Alexandre A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4166-4174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Rotenone at a high concentration acts as an inhibitor, an indication that the autoxidizable carrier is located uphill of the rotenone inhibition site (29Zoccarato F. Cavallini L. Alexandre A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4166-4174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 35Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J.

Furthermore, H2O2 release is inhibited by modestly increasing intramitochondrial Ca2+ (i.e. in the presence of contaminating Ca2+) and is partially inhibited by the contemporary oxidation of NAD-linked substrates (29Zoccarato F. Cavallini L. Alexandre A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4166-4174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In vivo, succinate is never oxidized alone by the mitochondria, and its concentration is dictated by the concentration of other tricarboxylic acid cycle substrates, which are NAD-dependent. Some of the experiments in Table II were performed with succinate together with glutamate and malate to try to reproduce a possible in vivo situation. In the absence of DACHR, the constitutive H2O2 release in State 4 with the three substrates was quite high when contaminating Ca2+ was removed by EGTA (this allowed a large contribution from succinate to the overall H2O2 output). Without EGTA, constitutive H2O2 generation was greatly decreased because contaminating Ca2+ depresses the succinate component of the H2O2 release (29Zoccarato F. Cavallini L. Alexandre A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4166-4174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Despite the high production rate, no H2O2 accumulation in the medium was visible with EGTA because the glutathione reductase/glutathione peroxidase system was fully functional under these conditions. In the presence of ADP (State 3), the succinate-dependent contribution to the overall constitutive H2O2 production both without and with EGTA was eliminated because of the decreased membrane potential. When DACHR was included, H2O2 output was invariably increased. The highest values were obtained in State 4 and with EGTA (i.e. under conditions in which the succinate-dependent component of peroxide release was maximal); without EG"
https://openalex.org/W1978527995,"Sphingosine kinase-1 (SK1) has emerged as a key component of cytokine responses, including roles in apoptosis, yet the specific mechanisms by which cytokines regulate SK1 in the apoptotic responses have not been studied. In this study, we show that prolonged treatment of MCF-7 cells with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces a dose- and time-dependent decrease in SK1 protein. Inhibition of the upstream caspase 8 by IETD significantly rescued TNF effects on SK1, yet the caspase 7 inhibitor DEVD failed to have any effect, suggesting that the decline in SK1 occurs downstream of the initiator caspase but upstream of the effector caspase. In addition to caspase activation, TNF caused disruption of lysosomes with relocation of the cysteine protease cathepsin B into the cytosol. Down-regulation of cathepsin B using small interfering RNA significantly restored SK1 levels following exposure to TNF, suggesting that SK1 loss was dependent on cathepsin B activity. The regulation of SK1 by the protease was further supported by the colocalization of SK1 with the lysosome and cathepsin B in cells and the loss of the colocalization following exposure to TNF. The ability of cathepsin B to regulate SK1 was further corroborated by an in vitro approach where recombinant cathepsin B cleaved SK1 at multiple sites to produce several cleavage fragments. Therefore, these studies show that SK1 down-regulation by TNF is dependent on the lysosomal pathway of apoptosis and specifically on cathepsin B, which functions as an SK1 protease in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2066492413,"Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite capable of causing devastating infections in immunocompromised and immunologically immature individuals. In this report, we demonstrate the relative independence of T. gondii from its host cell for aminoglycerophospholipid synthesis. The parasite can acquire the lipid precursors serine, ethanolamine, and choline from its environment and use them for the synthesis of its major lipids, phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn), and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), respectively. Dimethylethanolamine (Etn(Me)2), a choline analog, dramatically interfered with the PtdCho metabolism of T. gondii and caused a marked inhibition of its growth within human foreskin fibroblasts. In tissue culture medium supplemented with 2 mm Etn(Me)2, the parasite-induced lysis of the host cells was dramatically attenuated, and the production of parasites was inhibited by more than 99%. The disruption of parasite growth was paralleled by structural abnormalities in its membranes. In contrast, no negative effect on host cell growth and morphology was observed. The data also reveal that the Etn(Me)2-supplemented parasite had a time-dependent decrease in its PtdCho content and an equivalent increase in phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine, whereas other major lipids, PtdSer, PtdEtn, and PtdIns, remained largely unchanged. Relative to host cells, the parasites incorporated more than 7 times as much Etn(Me)2 into their phospholipid. These findings reveal that Etn(Me)2 selectively alters parasite lipid metabolism and demonstrate how selective inhibition of PtdCho synthesis is a powerful approach to arresting parasite growth.

Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous, obligate intracellular protozoan parasite capable of infecting virtually all types of nucleated mammalian and avian cells (1Tenter A.M. Heckeroth A.R. Weiss L.M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 1217-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar). As an opportunistic human pathogen, T. gondii is an important cause of disease in immunocompromised individuals (2Luft B.J. Hafner R. Korzun A.H. Leport C. Antoniskis D. Bosler E.M. Bourland D.D.

Microbiol. 1997; 51: 415-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Successful replication of T. gondii within its PV requires a substantial increase in membrane biogenesis. Despite the apparent segregation of the PV from the host cell endocytic network, metabolites essential for the parasite are known to exchange with the intravacuolar space. Shortly after infection, the PV membrane quickly becomes physically associated with sites of host cell lipid biosynthesis, the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (5Sinai A.P. Joiner K.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 415-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 6Sinai A.P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Therefore, these organelles might function as the donors of essential lipids to the growing parasite. Another possibility is that like Plasmodium falciparum (7Vial H.J. Ancelin M.L. Philippot J.R. Thuet M.J. Blood Cells. 1990; 16: 531-561PubMed Google Scholar), a related apicomplexan parasite, T. gondii is independent of its host regarding its lipid requirement and harbors its own lipid biosynthetic machinery. Currently there is a paucity of information about the lipid metabolism of T. gondii. A study by Charron and Sibley (8Charron A.J. Sibley L.D. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3049-3059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using fluorescent lipids and radioactive precursors suggested that T. gondii is capable of both autonomous phospholipid synthesis and scavenging of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) from the host cell, but no quantitative measurements were made. In this study, we investigated the phospholipid metabolism of the free T. gondii to gauge its capacity for membrane biogenesis independent of the host cell. We focused on the quantitative analysis of the aminoglycerophospholipid synthetic pathways that produce phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn), and PtdCho. In many eukaryotes the metabolism of these three lipids is intimately interconnected with the decarboxylation of PtdSer producing PtdEtn and the methylation of PtdEtn producing PtdCho (9Vance J.E. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Eukaryotes also possess pathways for PtdEtn and PtdCho synthesis via the Kennedy pathways using phospho-Etn/Cho and CDP-Etn/Cho intermediates (9Vance J.E. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We also investigated whether the ability of the parasite to autonomously synthesize phospholipid rendered it uniquely susceptible to modifiers of phospholipid metabolism. We specifically focused upon Etn(Me)2, which is known to alter the phospholipid composition of eukaryotic cells (10Schroeder F. Perlmutter J.F. Glaser M. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5015-5026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Maziere C. Maziere J.C. Mora L. Auclair M. Salmon S. Polonovski J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 137: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Our findings reveal that the parasite has a high capacity for independent phospholipid synthesis and that its PtdCho metabolism is markedly altered by Etn(Me)2 leading to a dramatic arrest of replication. Chemicals—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and MEM amino acids and vitamins were purchased from Invitrogen. The [3H]serine and [3H]ethanolamine were from Amersham Biosciences. The [3H]choline, [3H]leucine, and H332PO4 were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. CDP-[3H]choline and CDP-[1,2-14C]ethanolamine were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. and l-[U-14C]serine was from ICN Radiochemicals. The N,N-dimethylethanolamine (Etn(Me)2) was purchased from Aldrich. All lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Silica gel 60 and H plates for thin layer chromatography were obtained from Merck and Analtech, respectively. Stock solutions of Etn(Me)2 were prepared at a concentration of 5 m in 5 m HCl and were freshly diluted to the concentrations required for each experiment. Cell and Parasite Culture—Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) obtained from American Type Culture Collection were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, MEM non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 10% CO2. Cultures were passaged by trypsinization at least once a week, and host cells were used up to the 10th passage. T. gondii tachyzoites of the RH strain were propagated in vitro by serial passage in HFF monolayers. The parasites were counted in a hemocytometer and used for a new cycle of host invasion at the multiplicity of infection stated in the individual figure legends. To purify the parasites, supernatants from freshly lysed monolayers were collected and centrifuged followed by three subsequent washings with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The parasites were routinely used immediately after isolation. In the early stages of these studies we compared the radiolabeling of parasites purified on Nycodenz gradients (12Coppens I. Sinai A.P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) with those prepared by simple centrifugation and washing. We observed no significant differences between the two methods and hence used the centrifugation and washing procedure for the experiments described in this report. Lipid Precursor Labeling of T. gondii Tachyzoites—The labeling of extracellular T. gondii was performed in loosely capped polypropylene tubes at 37 °C for 1–6 h with shaking. Typically 1 × 108 parasites were incubated with [3H]Ser, [3H]Etn, [3H]Cho (10 μCi, 25 μm) or H332PO4 (30 μCi) in 1 ml of medium. The intracellular type medium contained 20 mm HEPES, 140 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2,5mm glucose, 0.1 μm CaCl2, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, MEM vitamin solution lacking choline, MEM amino acids, and serine-free non-essential amino acids, pH 7.4. The extracellular type medium contained 20 mm HEPES, Earl's basic salt solution without NaHCO3, 32.5 mm NaCl in place of NaHCO3, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, MEM vitamin mixture lacking choline, MEM amino acids, and serine-free non-essential amino acids, pH 7.4. The serine-free non-essential amino acid solution contained 10 μg/ml each of Ala, Asp, Glu, Gly, Pro, and Asn. ATP was freshly prepared and added to a final concentration of 1 mm along with 1 mm MgCl2 just prior to starting the reaction. The reaction was terminated by addition of 1.1 ml each of methanol and chloroform, vigorously mixed, and centrifuged. The lower chloroform phase of the resultant biphasic system was used for the recovery of phospholipid. Extraction and Analysis of Lipids—For chemical phosphorus determinations (13Rouser G. Siakatos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar), HFFs or unlabeled parasites were suspended in 5.8 ml of methanol:water (2:0.9, v/v) followed by the addition of 2 ml of chloroform, 1.8 ml of 0.2 m KCl, and 2 ml of chloroform, each accompanied with vigorous mixing. The aqueous upper phase was removed from the resultant biphasic system, and the lower chloroform phase was washed twice with methanol:KCl (0.2 m):chloroform (1:0.9:0.1, v/v). Lipids obtained from the labeled parasites were backwashed three times with 2.1 ml of methanol:PBS:chloroform (1:0.9:0.15, v/v). The lower phase (chloroform) containing lipids was recovered, dried under N2, and resuspended in 50–100 μl of chloroform:methanol (9:1, v/v). Lipids were separated and analyzed by one-dimensional TLC on silica gel H plates developed in chloroform:methanol:2-propanol:KCl (0.25%):triethylamine (90:28:75:18:54, v/v). Lipids were also separated by two-dimensional TLC on silica gel 60 plates developed in chloroform: methanol:NH4OH (65:35:5, v/v) and in chloroform:acetic acid:methanol: water (75:25:5:2.2, v/v). Phospholipids were visualized by staining with iodine vapor and/or spraying with 0.2% (w/v) anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid and exposure to ultraviolet light. All lipids were identified based on their co-migration with authentic standards. Preparation of Parasite Homogenates—A suspension containing 2 × 108T. gondii tachyzoites/ml in buffer (described below for different enzyme assays) was probe sonicated at 0 °C using five 30-s bursts at 50 watts with 30-s cooling intervals between bursts. The homogenates were kept on ice prior to initiating enzyme reactions. The enzyme reactions were routinely performed by premixing all assay components at 0 °C and then shifting to 37 °C. All assays were performed in 16 × 100-mm tubes at 37 °C for 45 min to 1 h. Heat-inactivated (95 °C for 30 min) enzyme extract was included as a negative control in each assay. Unless stated otherwise, the reactions were terminated with 1.5 ml of CH3OH:CHCl3 (2:1, v/v) followed by addition of 0.5 ml of CHCl3 and 0.7 ml of PBS. The resultant chloroform phase was backwashed three times with 1.8 ml of CH3OH:KCl (0.2 m):CHCl3 (10:9:1, v/v/v). The final chloroform phase was dried overnight in scintillation vials, and the radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Phosphatidylserine Decarboxylase Assay—Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase activity was measured by trapping 14CO2 released from Ptd-l-[U-14C]Ser on filter paper impregnated with 2 m KOH (14Dowhan W. Wickner W.T. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3079-3084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dioleoyl Ptd[U-14C]Ser was synthesized from l-[U-14C]serine and dioleoyl CDP-diacylglycerol by the action of PtdSer synthase. The PtdSer synthase was purified from Escherichia coli strain JA-200 harboring the plasmid pPS3155, which caused 100-fold overproduction of the enzyme (15Ohta A. Waggoner K. Louie K. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2219-2225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were performed in 16 × 100-mm borosilicate glass tubes sealed with an air-tight rubber septum to which was attached a well holding the base-saturated filter paper. The parasite extract was prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 0.25 m sucrose, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 3 mm EDTA. The 0.8-ml assay mixture contained 60 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.17 m sucrose, 0.35 mm PMSF, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm dioleoylphosphatidyl-l-[U-14C]serine (0.1 μCi/μmol), 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 0.2 ml of parasite extract. The reaction was terminated after 45 min by the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.25 m H2SO4 introduced through the rubber septum using a hypodermic needle. The radioactive CO2 evolved was trapped over a period of 30 min prior to recovering the filter paper for liquid scintillation spectrometry. Choline Phosphotransferase Assay—Choline phosphotransferase activity was measured by following the incorporation of radioactivity from CDP-[3H]choline into PtdCho in the presence of 1,2-dioleoylglycerol (16Hjelmstad R.H. Bell R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The cell extract was prepared in 0.25 m sucrose, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8). The 0.2-ml reactions contained 75 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 125 mm sucrose, 0.25 mm PMSF, 1.8 mm 1,2-dioleoylglycerol, 0.16% (w/v) Tween 20, 0.95 mm dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, 0.125 mm CDP-[3H]choline (2 nCi/nmol), and 0.1 ml of parasite extract. The reaction was terminated by lipid extraction. Ethanolamine Phosphotransferase Assay—Ethanolamine phosphotransferase activity was measured by following the incorporation of radioactivity from CDP-[1,2-14C]ethanolamine into PtdEtn in the presence of 1,2-dioleoylglycerol (16Hjelmstad R.H. Bell R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The cell extract was prepared as described above for the choline phosphotransferase assay. The 0.2-ml reactions contained 75 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 125 mm sucrose, 0.25 mm PMSF, 0.65 mm 1,2-dioleoylglycerol, 0.65 mm dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, 0.42% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.2 mm CDP-[1,2-14C]ethanolamine (2.5 nCi/nmol), and 0.1 ml of parasite extract. The reaction was terminated by lipid extraction, and the chloroform phase was washed three times with 1.8 ml of CH3OH:PBS:CHCl3 (10:9:1.2, v/v/v). CDP-diacylglycerol-dependent Phosphatidylserine Synthase Assay— CDP-diacylglycerol-dependent phosphatidylserine synthase activity was measured by following PtdSer synthesis from l-[3H]serine in the presence of CDP-diacylglycerol (17Carman G. Bae-Lee M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The enzyme extract was prepared in 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8), 0.25 m sucrose, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The 0.21 ml assay contained 40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 0.6 mm MnCl2, 0.19 mm CDP-diacylglycerol, 0.25% (w/v) Triton X-100, 120 mm sucrose, 0.24 mm PMSF, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.95 mm [3H]serine (10 nCi/nmol), and 0.1 ml of cell extract. The reaction was terminated by lipid extraction. Base Exchange-dependent Phosphatidylserine Synthase Assay—Base exchange-dependent phosphatidylserine synthase activity was measured by following PtdSer synthesis in the presence of l-[3H]serine, PtdEtn, and calcium. The cell extract was prepared in 10 mm Na-HEPES (pH 8), 0.25 m sucrose, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The 0.2-ml assay contained 25 mm Na-HEPES (pH 8), 10 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm dioleoyl PtdEtn, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 125 mm sucrose, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.25 mm PMSF, 1 mm [3H]serine (100 nCi/nmol), and 0.1 ml of the cell extract. Where indicated CaCl2 was omitted and replaced with 5 mm EDTA. The reaction was terminated by lipid extraction followed by four backwashes with 1.8 ml of CH3OH: PBS:CHCl3 (10:9:1.2, v/v/v). The lipid was dried, resuspended in 50 μl of CHCl3, and analyzed on a silica gel H plate in chloroform:methanol: 2-propanol:aqueous KCl (0.25%):triethylamine (90:28:75:18:54, v/v). The PtdSer and its decarboxylated product, PtdEtn, were identified by co-migration with standards, recovered from the plate, and subjected to liquid scintillation spectrometry. [3H]Uracil Labeling of Parasites—The parasite RNA metabolism was examined by measuring the incorporation of [3H]uracil into nucleic acids. The HFF cells were grown in 24-well plates until reaching confluence and then infected with parasites at a multiplicity of 2. The cells were treated with 2 mm Etn(Me)2 at the time of infection as described in the figure legends. After 6 h of incubation the noninvading parasites were removed by washing the monolayer twice with PBS. The cultures were shifted to complete medium supplemented with 5 μCi/well [3H]uracil. After 16 h in the presence of radioisotope the wells were washed with cold PBS and then treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 15 min on ice to precipitate macromolecules. Subsequently the precipitate was washed with cold PBS and neutralized with 200 μl of 0.2 m NaOH. The solubilized macromolecules were recovered after shaking for 15 min at 37 °C. The radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Electron Microscopy of Toxoplasma—Infected human foreskin fibroblasts were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature and then processed for thin section transmission electron microscopy as described previously (18Coppens I. Joiner K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3804-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) before examination with a Philips CM120 electron microscope (Eindhoven, The Netherlands) under 80 kV. Toxoplasma Can Metabolize Free Serine into PtdSer and PtdEtn—T. gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite with only a brief extracellular phase when propagated in vitro. The viability of the parasite declines with a t½ of 10 h outside the host cell (19Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). We examined phospholipid synthesis in extracellular parasites to assess the capacity of the organism for autonomous membrane biogenesis. The aminoglycerophospholipids PtdCho, PtdEtn, and PtdSer constitute the bulk of membrane polar lipids in most animal eukaryotes. Initially we examined the metabolism of [3H]Ser and found that this precursor was readily incorporated into the parasite lipid pool (Fig. 1A). The lipid synthesis was nearly linear for the first 2 h and then slowed progressively over the ensuing 4 h of incubation. The two major lipids synthesized from [3H]Ser were PtdSer and PtdEtn as determined by thin layer chromatography shown in Fig. 2. Two minor lipids co-migrated with PtdCho and PtdIns regions of thin layer plates. However, unlike PtdCho and PtdIns, these lipids were stable against alkaline deacylation suggesting they are sphingolipids that are expected to also be labeled with [3H]Ser. Further identification of these minor lipids was not undertaken in this study.Fig. 2T. gondii can metabolize serine to synthesize PtdSer and PtdEtn. Purified T. gondii tachyzoites of the RH strain (108) were incubated with [3H]Ser (10 μCi, 25 μm) at 37 °C in extracellular type medium followed by lipid extraction. The lipids were separated on a silica gel H plate using chloroform:methanol:2-propanol:KCl (0.25% in water):triethylamine (90:28:75:18:54, v/v). The phospholipid bands were visualized under UV light after spraying with 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid (0.2%, w/v). The bands were scraped, and the radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Values are means ± S.E. for three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Initially [3H]Ser was metabolized to PtdSer that was rapidly decarboxylated to PtdEtn (Fig. 2). We failed to detect any evidence of significant methylation of nascent PtdEtn to form PtdCho (see also [3H]Etn labeling studies described below). We also considered that the parasite might require exogenous S-adenosylmethionine, the methyl group donor for PtdEtn methylation in eukaryotes. We performed the same experiment with [3H]Ser labeling in the presence of 1 mm S-adenosylmethionine but failed to detect any significant PtdCho synthesis or any qualitative or quantitative change in the overall lipid biosynthesis (data not shown). We also carried out this experiment in intracellular type (high K+/Na+) as well as extracellular type (high Na+/K+) medium but found no differences in Ser metabolism. From these experiments we conclude that the parasite has active PtdSer synthase and PtdSer decarboxylase but negligible PtdEtn methyltransferase. Toxoplasma Can Metabolize Etn into PtdEtn but Does Not Methylate the Lipid—We next examined the metabolism of [3H]Etn by the free parasite. As shown in Fig. 1A, T. gondii could also acquire Etn from its environment and readily incorporate it into polar lipids. Like Ser, the metabolism of Etn also showed a time-dependent increase in lipid synthesis that progressively slowed over a 6-h period. The major lipid produced was PtdEtn (Fig. 3). Other minor lipids co-migrating with PtdSer, PtdCho, and PtdIns were also observed, but their identities are not known. Similar to experiments with [3H]Ser, we did not find evidence for any significant conversion of PtdEtn to PtdCho. In addition, supplementation of cultures with 1 mmS-adenosylmethionine also failed to produce any PtdCho from [3H]Etn. From these studies we conclude that T. gondii can readily synthesize PtdEtn from Etn and that the resultant pool of phospholipid is not converted to PtdCho. Toxoplasma Can Metabolize Choline into PtdCho—The incorporation of [3H]Cho into the polar lipids of T. gondii was also examined. The extracellular T. gondii could readily acquire Cho from the medium (Fig. 1B) and metabolized it into PtdCho (Fig. 4). The Cho metabolism was linear for 6 h in extracellular type medium (high Na+/K+), although it showed a very high interexperimental variation for unknown reasons. The major lipid synthesized was PtdCho, and no other lipid classes were significantly labeled under our experimental conditions. When labeling experiments were conducted in intracellular type medium (high K+/Na+), we typically observed a doubling of the amount of PtdCho synthesized as compared with extracellular type medium. Quantification of the phospholipid profile of the free parasite by chemical measurement of phosphorus demonstrated that PtdCho was the most prevalent lipid and accounted for about 75% of the total phospholipid. The next most abundant lipids were PtdEtn (10%), PtdIns (7.5%), PtdSer (6%), and PtdOH (1%). The parasite phospholipid class distribution was significantly different from that of the host cell, described later in Fig. 9. Comparing the uptake of all lipid precursors tested in this study, Etn showed the fastest rate of metabolism under the extracellular ionic conditions followed by Cho and Ser. In the intracellular type medium, the metabolism of Ser and Etn was largely unaffected but that of Cho was increased about 2-fold (see Fig. 1B), suggesting that Cho metabolism may be upregulated in response to parasitic invasion of host cells. The lipid precursors described in the preceding experiments were used at concentrations within the range of tissue culture media. We conducted additional experiments using precursor concentrations that gave maximal rates of incorporation into lipid. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 5. The maximum rates of PtdSer, PtdEtn, and PtdCho synthesis were 4.2, 12.4, and 8.2 nmol/8 h, respectively, for aliquots of 108 cells. These rates of phospholipid synthesis were sufficient for a cell doubling for PtdEtn, 50% of that required for PtdSer, and ∼9% of that required for a cell doubling for PtdCho. These estimates were based upon a phospholipid content of T. gondii of 130 nmol/108 cells as determined by measurement of lipid phosphorus.Fig. 5Aminoglycerophospholipid synthesis increases with water-soluble precursor concentration. Purified T. gondii tachyzoites (108) were incubated with [3H]Ser, [3H]Etn, and [3H]Cho in the intracellular type medium for 4 h at 37 °C, and the incorporation of the precursors into lipid was quantified by lipid extraction and liquid scintillation spectrometry. Values are means ± S.E. for three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Lipid Enzymology Identifies the Major Pathways for Aminoglycerophospholipid Synthesis—In conjunction with the in vivo labeling of T. gondii, we also measured the activities of key enzymes in phospholipid biosynthesis in extracts prepared from isolated parasites (Table I). As anticipated from the [3H]Etn and [3H]Cho incorporation data, the terminal enzymes of the Kennedy pathways for PtdEtn and PtdCho synthesis (20Vance D.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes, 4th Ed. Elsevier, Amsterdam2002: 205-232Google Scholar) were measurable in homogenates prepared from the parasites. Both Cho phosphotransferase and Etn phosphotransferase activities increased 2-fold in the presence of exogenous 1,2-dioleoylglycerol. The Cho phosphotransferase activity was more than twice the rate of Etn phosphotransferase activity as shown in Table I. PtdSer synthase was measured using methods for the base exchange activity and the CDP-diacylglycerol-dependent activity. The base exchange activity was Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent. Chelation of Ca2+ with EDTA eliminated catalytic activity. The inclusion of PtdEtn in the reaction, as a donor of the phosphatidyl moiety, increased the catalytic activity 6–8-fold. Low activity for PtdSer synthesis was observed using conditions for the CDP-diacylglycerol-dependent reaction. We were unable to demonstrate any dependence of PtdSer synthesis upon the addition of CDP-diacylglycerol. The PtdSer decarboxylase activity (214 nmol/h/mg of protein) was 200-fold higher than that of the other lipid synthetic enzymes mea"
https://openalex.org/W2008120659,"We characterize changes in isomeric states of the retinylidene chromophore during light-dark adaptation and photochemical reactions of Anabaena (Nostoc) sp. PCC7120 sensory rhodopsin (ASR). The results show that ASR represents a new type of microbial rhodopsin with a number of unusual characteristics. The three most striking are: (i) a primarily all-trans configuration of retinal in the dark-adapted state and (ii) a primarily 13-cis light-adapted state with a blue-shifted and lower extinction absorption spectrum, opposite of the case of bacteriorhodopsin; and (iii) efficient reversible light-induced interconversion between the 13-cis and all-trans unphotolyzed states of the pigment. The relative amount of ASR with cis and trans chromophore forms depends on the wavelength of illumination, providing a mechanism for single-pigment color sensing analogous to that of phytochrome pigments. In addition ASR exhibits unusually slow formation of L-like and M-like intermediates, with a dominant accumulation of M during the photocycle. Co-expression of ASR with its putative cytoplasmic transducer protein shifts the absorption maximum and strongly decreases the rate of dark adaptation of ASR, confirming interaction between the two proteins. Thus ASR, the first non-haloarchaeal sensory rhodopsin character-ized, demonstrates the diversity of photochemistry of microbial rhodopsins. Its photochromic properties and the position of its two ground state absorption maxima suggest it as a candidate for controlling differential photosynthetic light-harvesting pigment synthesis (chromatic adaptation) or other color-sensitive physiological responses in Anabaena cells.

Over the past 5 years microbial genomics has revealed a large family of photoactive, seven-transmembrane helix, retinylidene proteins called microbial (or type 1) rhodopsins (1Spudich J.L. Yang C.S.

Hegemann P. News Physiol. Sci. 2004; 19: 133-137PubMed Google Scholar), studies of non-haloarchaeal pigments are needed. Anabaena sensory rhodopsin (ASR) is well suited for exploration (5Jung K.H. Trivedi V.D. Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It is the first known prokaryotic sensory representative outside of haloarchaea, and its function appears to involve activation of a cytoplasmic transducer, unlike SRI and SRII, which transmit signals to other integral membrane proteins (methyl-accepting taxis transducers) in a molecular complex. Recently, an atomic structure of ASR and color sensitivity of its retinylidene chromophore isomeric structure were reported (9Vogeley L. Sineshchekov O.A. Trivedi V.D. Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. Luecke H. Science. 2004; 306: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In this study we present analysis of light-dark adaptation in ASR, which shows that the pigment undergoes inverse (as compared with BR) changes in isomeric configuration of its retinal chromophore. Our measurements also confirm and extend characterization of photochemical reactions of the pigment and its interaction with a proposed water-soluble transducer (5Jung K.H. Trivedi V.D. Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The results reveal fundamental differences from the haloarchaeal rhodopsins in these basic properties and illustrate the intriguing diversity in photochemistry of the rapidly expanding type l family. ASR Expression and Purification—Echerichia coli transformants were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium in the presence of ampicillin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C. Constructs used to express the ASR with and without the co-transcribed 14-kDa soluble proteins were the same as described earlier in E. coli strain UT5600 and/or BL21 (5Jung K.H. Trivedi V.D. Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). For purification of ASR, a truncated form containing residues 1–239 with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag was used. Cells containing the plasmid were cultivated on a gyratory shaker at 180 rpm and induced at A600 = 0.4 by addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 5 μm all-trans-retinal. Cells were harvested 4 h post-induction and used for membrane preparation as described (5Jung K.H. Trivedi V.D. Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). For optical measurements cells were washed and transferred to buffer containing 10 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm CaSO4, 3 mm Tris, or 1 mm HEPES, adjusted to the desired pH. Membrane preparations from cells expressing ASR apoprotein without retinal were used for pigment reconstitution using all-trans-retinal as described (10Spudich E.N. Sundberg S.A. Manor D. Spudich J.L. Proteins. 1986; 1: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Reconstituted membranes were used for retinal extraction. For protein purification, membranes were solubilized in 1% octyl glucoside or 1% dodecyl maltoside with 300 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm imidazole, and 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8 (or 8.0) containing 1 mm PMSF. Detergent-extracted protein was bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads, which were then washed with 20 and 50 mm imidazole in the same buffer and the protein was eluted with 200 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was concentrated and dialyzed to remove excess detergent and imidazole. Purified protein, membranes, and intact cells of E. coli with expressed ASR after at least 1 h under white fluorescent room light at room temperature were considered as light-adapted. For full dark adaptation the samples were incubated in darkness overnight at room temperature. To facilitate light adaptation in some experiments (e.g. extraction of retinal) the samples were illuminated from a 150-watt halogen bulb illuminator using white or >520 nm heat-filtered light for 2 min. Absorption and Flash Photolysis Measurements—Absorption spectra in the UV-visible range were measured on a Cary 4000 spectrophotometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA). For membranes and intact cell samples an integrated sphere attachment was used. The rate of light-dark adaptation was determined as the dependence of the amplitude of the differential (Amax-Amin) spectra on time fitted with an exponential function. For determination of the dependence of the ratio of two forms on the wavelength of pre-illuminating light the value of the absorption at the maximum of the differential spectrum (560 nm for purified protein) was used. Flash-induced absorption changes were acquired on a laboratory-constructed cross-beam flash photolysis system as described (11Wang W.W. Sineshchekov O.A. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33985-33991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The actinic flash was from a Nd-YAG pulse laser (Continuum, Surelight I; 532 nm, 6 ns, 40 mJ). Signals from the photomultiplier were amplified by a low noise current amplifier Keithley 428 (Keithley Instruments Inc., Cleveland, OH), digitized by a DIGIDATA 1320A at 4 μs/point and stored in a PC using the Clampex 8.0 program (both from Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). 20–100 transients obtained with a 5-s flash interval were averaged. To minimize excitation artifacts equal amounts of signals with the measuring beam blocked (scattered light) were averaged and subtracted from the measuring beam-monitored signals. The Clampfit 9.0 program (Axon Instruments) was used for data analysis. Retinal Isomers Determination—Purple membranes consisting of BR and lipid and reconstituted ASR membranes were used for retinal extractions using the method of (12Scherrer P. Mathew M.K. Sperling W. Stoeckenius W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) with modification. 200-μl membrane samples were mixed with 600 μl of ice-cold ethanol followed by 400 μl of hexane with vortexing. Phases were separated by centrifugation for 2 min at 1350 rpm and extracted retinal isomers in the top layer (hexane phase) were carefully withdrawn. The extracted retinal was dried with argon gas stream and dissolved in EtOH before subjecting to HPLC or in some cases for storage at –80 °C. The extraction procedure was conducted in the dark. The extracted retinal samples were analyzed on a Partisil-5 (Whatman Inc.) analytical column on a Waters Delta600 HPLC equipped with PDA detector and EMPOWER software. The solvent used for HPLC run was 97.5% hexane, 1.5% EtOH, and 1% ethyl acetate at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and the progress of each chromatogram was monitored at 360 nm. The relative amounts of isomers were calculated as areas under the peaks and corrected for their extinction coefficients. All data presented here were analyzed, fitted, and plotted using the Origin 7.0 program (OriginLab Corp., Northhampton, MA). Light-Dark Adaptation in ASR Is Opposite to That of BR— The absorption maximum of purified ASR protein in 0.1% dodecyl maltoside adapted to white day light for 1 h is ∼541 nm. Upon dark adaptation the absorption maximum shifts to 547 nm, and its maximum extinction increases (Fig. 1A). Similar dark adaptation of ASR takes place in isolated E. coli membranes, although the absorption maxima of the light- and dark-adapted forms are shifted to longer wavelengths by 2–5 nm (Fig. 1B). These changes are opposite to those which occur in dark-adaptation of BR (13Ohno K. Takeuchi Y. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 462: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Pettei M.J. Yudd A.P. Nakanishi K. Henselman R. Stoeckenius W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1955-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Light-adapted minus dark-adapted differential spectra in ASR and BR are mirror symmetrical including the fine structured β-bands between 350 and 450 nm characteristic of the trans/cis isomerization of retinal, indicating the inversed as compared with BR (15Balashov S.P. Govindjee R. Imasheva E.S. Misra S. Ebrey T.G. Feng Y. Crouch R.K. Menick D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8820-8834Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) direction of changes in isomeric configuration during dark adaptation in ASR (Fig. 1C). Light adaptation in BR is known to transform its retinylidene chromophore from a partially 13-cis to essentially completely all-trans form (12Scherrer P. Mathew M.K. Sperling W. Stoeckenius W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14Pettei M.J. Yudd A.P. Nakanishi K. Henselman R. Stoeckenius W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1955-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The mirror symmetric spectral changes in ASR indicate that in contrast to BR, light converts ASR to a predominantly cis form. Due to the longer wavelength absorption of ASR in the E. coli membrane than in the purified protein, the positions of the minima and maxima in the differential spectra in membranes are shifted to longer wavelengths (from 470 and 560 nm to up to 494 and 568 nm, respectively). Similar differential spectra were obtained in whole cells (see below). Dark adaptation follows mono-exponential dependence with time constant ∼1.5 h in purified protein and more than 2 h in membranes at neutral pH (Fig. 1D). Identity in the kinetics of spectral changes in the main and short wavelength absorption bands indicate that both bands result from the same transition, and therefore the absence of long living intermediates participating in the observed spectral changes during dark adaptation. The inversed directions of dark adaptation in ASR and BR is also confirmed by mirror symmetrical Fourier transform infrared spectra of their light-adapted minus dark-adapted forms in ASR and BR. 2V. Bergo, personal communication. According to Fourier transform infrared and the recent structural data (9Vogeley L. Sineshchekov O.A. Trivedi V.D. Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. Luecke H. Science. 2004; 306: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), 13-cis and all-trans isomers are in 15-syn and 15-anti conformations, respectively. Extraction of retinal from dark-adapted purified protein and membranes of E. coli in the dark-adapted state produced 67% of ASR in the all-trans and 33% in the cis configuration (Fig. 2A). In the light-adapted state, in contrast to BR, in which illumination converts the pigment ∼100% to the trans form (Fig. 2B), 80% of ARS is present in the 13-cis form. The ratio of 13-cis to all-trans forms is increased by light adaptation of ASR by nearly an order of magnitude, whereas in BR it drops close to zero (Fig. 2C). Based on these data the individual absorption spectra for all-trans and 13-cis forms of ASR were calculated (Fig. 1A). The absorption maxima of these forms in purified protein are at 550 and 537 nm, respectively, and the maximum extinction of the 13-cis form is ∼20% lower than that of the all-trans form. Photochromicity of ASR—The relative amounts of retinal isomers in light- and dark-adapted forms can be monitored by the absorption at the maximum of the differential spectra (560 nm for purified protein). Illumination of ASR with long wave-length light (580 nm), preferentially absorbed by the dark-adapted (trans) form, converts it to the blue-shifted light-adapted (cis) form (Fig. 3A). Symmetrically, illumination with short wavelength light, which is better absorbed by the cis form, converts it partially back to the trans form. Changes in the absorption at 560 nm between orange and blue light pre-illuminated ASR are 15–20% of that during full dark adaptation. The normalized differential absorption spectrum between ASR adapted to different wavelengths is identical to the differential absorption spectrum of dark adaptation, which excludes that the observed absorption changes are due to accumulation of long-lived intermediates of the ASR photochemical reaction cycle (Fig. 3B). We measured the ratio of cis and trans forms of purified ASR by the difference in absorption at 560 nm after illumination with light of various wavelengths. The ratio was calculated from the absorbance at 560 nm after the illumination and was plotted as a function of the wavelength of illumination (points in Fig. 3C). Light fluences above the saturating levels for this effect were used. In the same figure, the ratio of the absorption values of the spectra of the light- and dark-adapted sample is shown. The near-perfect fit of the two dependencies in purified ASR (i.e. the amplitudes of the light-induced changes (points) and the ratio of the spectra (line)) shows that the transition between the cis and trans forms depends only on their relative absorption at particular wavelengths, providing a basis for an efficient color sensing mechanism, similar to that in the phytochrome system (16Wagner G. Hader D.P. Lebert M. Comprehensive Series in Photosciences. 1. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam2001: 421-448Google Scholar, 17Wang H. Deng X.W. Somerville C.R. Meyerowitz E.M. The Arabidopsis Book. American Society of Plant Biologists, Rockville, MD2002: 1-28Google Scholar, 18Gyula P. Schafer E. Nagy F. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The maximum amount of cis form is accumulated at 580 nm and the minimum amount at 470 nm in purified protein. In membranes the absorption spectra of light- and dark-adapted forms are shifted to longer wavelengths (Fig. 1B). Consequently, the color sensitivity of ASR in its native state, presumed to be more similar to ASR in E. coli membranes than in a purified state, is expected to be shifted to 600 and 480 nm, as shown by the dashed line (Fig. 3C). The photochromicity of ASR with an action spectrum corresponding to the ratio of the absorbancies of cis and trans forms (Fig. 3C) indicates that the efficiency of cis-to-trans and trans-to-cis photoconversions are of the same order of magnitude. Averaged extinction of the cis form of ASR through the visible region is 1.17-fold lower than that of the trans form. However, its photostationary concentration is 3.9-fold higher under the white illumination (Fig. 2). This means that the quantum yield of photoconversion from the ASR form with trans-retinal to the form with cis-retinal is ∼3.3-fold higher than the quantum yield of the opposite photoconversion. This is an essential difference from BR, in which light-induced conversion of the light-adapted (trans form) to 13-cis form (“dark adaptation by light”) can be observed only in partially dehydrated films (19Korenstein R. Hess B. FEBS Lett. 1977; 82: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20Kouyama T. Bogomolni R.A. Stoeckenius W. Biophys. J. 1985; 48: 201-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), water glycerol suspensions of wild type and in some mutants (21Balashov S.P. Litvin F.F. Sineshchekov V.A. Skulachev V.P. Physicochemical Biology Reviews. 8. Harwood Academic Publishers, UK1988: 1-61Google Scholar, 22Govindjee R. Misra S. Balashov S.P. Ebrey T.G. Crouch R.K. Menick D.R. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1011-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), or in purple membrane and monomeric BR in detergent under very high intensity red light inducing a two-quantum process (23Casadio R. Gutowitz H. Mowery P. Taylor M. Stoeckenius W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 590: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions continuous illumination (light adaptation) of BR rapidly accumulates nearly 100% all-trans chromophore. The Photochemical Reaction Cycle of ASR—According to the retinal extraction data in white light-adapted ASR the amount of the cis form is ∼4-fold higher than that of the trans form (Fig. 2), and the rate of dark adaptation is in the range of hours (Fig. 1D). The ratio of trans to cis form extinctions at 532 nm is only 10% lower than that averaged through the visible spectrum (Fig. 1A). Therefore repetitive flash excitation with 532 nm from a Nd-YAG-laser with 5-s intervals might be expected to accumulate mostly the 13-cis species, and the weak measuring light used during flash photolysis would not be expected to significantly change the ratio. Nevertheless, both 13-cis and all-trans photocycles can contribute to the laser-induced absorption changes, and we cannot distinguish their respective contributions in these measurements. Kinetic flash-induced absorption difference spectra indicate the existence of at least four photointermediates in the photocycle, named according to the BR photointermediates: K with absorption ≤600 nm, L (∼470 nm), M (with unprotonated Schiff base, ∼400 nm), and O (with reprotonated Schiff base, ∼620 nm) (Fig. 4A). The kinetics of flash-induced absorption changes at wavelengths corresponding predominantly to the unphotolyzed state and K, L, M, and O intermediates are presented in Fig. 4B. In the red region the maximum in the difference spectrum at 30 μs is at 600 nm, later shifting to longer wavelength (620 nm) indicating the appearance of the more red-shifted O intermediate. A fast decaying component in absorption at 600 nm correlates with an increase in absorption at 450 nm (∼70 μs). In analogy to BR photocycle, this kinetics can be interpreted as a transition from a K to L intermediate, which is dramatically slower than in BR. The decay in absorption at 450 and its rise at 400 nm are very similar, indicating transition from an L to M intermediate. Formation of the M state monitored at 400 nm is bi-phasic and unusually slow. In purified protein the rise-time components are ∼1 and ∼5 ms (with higher contribution of the slower component). In membranes and intact cells the rate of the slow component is further decreased (τMs ∼12–15 ms), and its contribution rises to 85%. The decay times of M are similar in cells, membranes, and purified protein (50–60 ms). The M and O intermediates decay in parallel with only slightly longer τ of the O intermediate (∼80 versus ∼60 ms). The ratio of absorption changes at 650 nm and 400 nm in the time window after the maximum of the M intermediate accumulation is almost constant, indicating equilibrium between M and O. The equilibrium is greatly shifted toward M. One can estimate the “effective concentration” of the M and O intermediates by multiplying their mean relative concentrations by their mean time of existence (integrating absorption changes in time). The ratio of such integrals for 400 and 620 nm is ∼7. Assuming roughly equal extinction of M and O intermediates and negligible contributions of fast components to the integrals, the effective concentration of the M intermediate comprises ∼87% of photolyzed ASR. M formation and decay rates are strongly pH-dependent (Fig. 5A). The titration of the rate of M rise indicates a proton acceptor with pKa ∼8.1 (Fig. 5B), nevertheless approximately half of M formation can still be observed in intact cells of E. coli at strongly acidic conditions (down to pH ∼3) (Fig. 5A). Thus, two proton acceptors may be involved in deprotonation of the Schiff base. Alternatively, the proton acceptor in ASR has a very low pK, and the ∼15-fold increase in the rate of M formation with pKa ∼8.1 may be due to the strong influence of other groups on its proton affinity, as has been found for BR (15Balashov S.P. Govindjee R. Imasheva E.S. Misra S. Ebrey T.G. Feng Y. Crouch R.K. Menick D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8820-8834Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24Balashov S.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 75-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The rate of M decay titrates at more acidic pH than the rise (Fig. 5B). It is not clear to what extend the complex fine structure in flash-induced differential spectra (Fig. 4A), multicomponential kinetics of absorbance changes (Fig. 4B), and possible existence of two proton acceptors (Fig. 5) are attributable to the presence of two isomeric form of ASR in the light-adapted sample. The Effect of the Putative ASR Transducer on ASR Spectral Properties and Dark Adaptation—A 14-kDa soluble protein encoded in the ASR operon in the Anabaena chromosome has been shown to accelerate M decay of ASR and is a likely transducer for ASR signals (5Jung K.H. Trivedi V.D. Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The putative soluble transducer decreases the rate of dark adaptation of ASR in cells of E. coli ∼1.7-fold (Fig. 6). In highly scattering cell suspensions the exact positions of the absorption maxima of ASR and ASR co-expressed with 14-kDa protein are difficult to compare. Nevertheless, a long wavelength shift in the differential light-adapted minus dark-adapted sample is evident in the presence of the 14 kDa protein (Fig. 6, inset). The position of the maximum changes in absorption upon dark adaptation of ASR in E. coli cells is close to that in membranes (∼567 nm, see Fig. 1B). Co-expression with 14-kDa protein shifts it to 572 nm, indicating an absorption spectrum shift upon interaction of the two proteins. The data above show that ASR represents a new type of microbial rhodopsin with a number of unique characteristics. The two most striking are: (i) light adaptation converts most of the pigment to a 13-cis form, opposite to the case of BR; and (ii) efficient reversible light-induced conversion takes place between cis and trans unphotolyzed states of the pigment, providing color-sensitive ground states analogous to those in phytochrome pigments. The existence of an unprotonated Schiff base species (M) and unidentified red-shifted intermediates in the photochemical cycle of ASR has been shown earlier (5Jung K.H. Trivedi V.D. Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In the present study with high time resolution flash photolysis we detected and kinetically characterized K, L, M, and O intermediates. The most remarkable feature of the ASR photocycle is the unusually slow formation of the L and M intermediates, which takes at least an order of magnitude longer time than in BR. A dominant accumulation of M during the photocycle was observed. The existence of two populations of ASR in the light-adapted state with cis- and trans-retinal does not allow assigning the observed spectral changes to each of them in this study. ASR, the first non-haloarchaeal sensory rhodopsin characterized, therefore demonstrates the diversity of the photochemistry of the microbial rhodopsins. The physiological function of ASR is not yet known, but in cyanobacteria several physiological processes depend on light in the region of ASR absorption (5Jung K.H. Trivedi V.D. Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). For example, cyanobacteria adjust the pigment composition of their photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes based on the color of available light, a phenomenon called chromatic adaptation (25Grossman A.R. Bhaya D. He Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11449-11452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Action spectra for chromatic adaptation show that orange-red light stimulates synthesis of phycocyanin, whereas shorter wave-length green light activates synthesis of phycoerythrin. This color-sensitive pigment synthesis is generally assumed to be based on participation of two competitive receptor pigments with orange-red versus green absorption maxima. However, the properties of photochromic ASR show that it is possible that such color sensing could be achieved by a single photoreceptor, namely ASR in its two photointerconvertible ground states. The ratio of cis and trans forms of ASR could in principle serve as a signal for the chromatic adaptation response, their relative amounts being controlled by the color of illumination. The signaling mechanism could make use of either the ratio of the two unphotolyzed forms or photochemical reaction of one of the forms, since in both cases the photointerconversion between the cis and the trans forms of the pigment depend on the light quality. The former mechanism would have an advantage of eliminating the “light intensity noise,” detecting only the spectral composition of illumination but not the fluctuation of its intensity (e.g. during the day cycle). In Anabaena the ASR gene is encoded in an operon containing a second gene, which encodes a water-soluble 14-kDa protein. The 14-kDa protein has been shown to bind to ASR in E. coli cells as well as in vitro and has been suggested to be a cytoplasmic transducer for ASR signals (5Jung K.H. Trivedi V.D. Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Our measurements here confirm the interaction by revealing effects of the 14-kDa protein on ASR properties. Co-expression of ASR with the 14-kDa protein significantly decreases the rate of dark adaptation (Fig. 6), and the differential spectrum of light-dark adaptation in intact cells of E. coli with co-expressed ASR and 14-kDa protein is shifted ∼5 nm to longer wavelengths from that for ASR expressed alone (Fig. 6, inset). Also we confirm an effect of the putative transducer on the photocycle rate as reported by Jung et al. (5Jung K.H. Trivedi V.D. Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) (data not shown). A functional role for light-dark adaptation and photochromicity of ASR has not been demonstrated, but color discrimination in the region of the spectrum to which ASR responds would be useful for chromatic adaptation in the photosynthetic light-harvesting system as well as for correlated physiological responses. Detailed action spectroscopy and genetic analysis of physiological responses are necessary for testing this hypothesis. We thank Elena Spudich for advice on experimental procedures and Kwang-Hwan Jung and Elena Govorunova for a preparation used in the initial phase of measurements."

Control of cell fate is essential for the progress of stem cell research. A fundamental question that remains unresolved is when differentiated cells switch fates, do they go developmentally “backwards” or do they take a novel pathway? Though adult stem cells may soon play a powerful role in regenerative medicine, the developmental potential of adult stem cells is still ambiguous (e.g., Priller et al., 2001Priller J. Persons D.A. Klett F.F. Kempermann G. Kreutzberg G.W. Dirnagl U. Neogenesis of cerebellar Purkinje neurons from gene-marked bone marrow cells in vivo.J.

Defining the developmental potential of hematopoietic stem cells is problematic partly because bone marrow is a heterogeneous tissue, and stem cells cannot be positively identified in vivo. Therefore, if adult stem cells are developmentally plastic, it is not yet known when, where, how, and how many cells switch their determined states. By contrast, the old phenomenon of transdetermination (TD) in flies is a well-characterized example of cell plasticity. Late in larval development, imaginal disc cells are rigidly determined to form specific fly structures. At this time, some cells in the disc already express tissue-specific genes such as neuralized (neur) and thus are already differentiated, though not yet terminally differentiated (Hadorn, 1978Hadorn E.

Leg disc cells that are determined to form specific anterior leg structures will activate the selector gene engrailed (en) and regenerate an entire posterior leg compartment. Moreover, if any disc is injured in a specific region, known as the “weak point,” a few of the regenerating cells will switch fate and transdetermine (Gehring, 1966Gehring W.

Thus, regenerating leg discs can form wing structures, a switch that is regulated by vestigial (vg), and regenerating antennal discs can form leg structures, a switch regulated by Antennapedia (Antp). TD, therefore, alters the expression of the homeotic selector genes (Gehring, 1972Gehring W. The stability of the determined state in cultures of imaginal disks in Drosophila.in: Ursprung H.

It is only a defined subset of disc cells, however, that are capable of changing selector gene expression, making the imaginal disc a good model system to investigate the control of developmental plasticity. Previous work correlates cell proliferation with TD and indicates that cell division is necessary for TD. More injury of discs elicits more growth, a greater frequency, and a larger area of TD (Wildermuth, 1968Wildermuth H.

Cell specific determination and the relationship between proliferation and transdetermination in leg and wing primordia in Drosophila melanogaster.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1966; 16: 609-633PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, when disc fragments are cultured under conditions where cell division is impaired, TD is not observed (Schubiger, 1973Schubiger G. Regeneration of Drosophila melanogaster male leg disc fragments in sugar fed female hosts.Experientia. 1973; 29: 631-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To explain these observations, it has been proposed that additional cell divisions are a prerequisite for TD (Hadorn, 1978Hadorn E. Transdetermination.in: Ashburner M. Wright T.R.F. The Genetics and Biology of Drosophila. Academic Press, New York1978: 555-617Google Scholar). Similar observations are reported in mammalian stem cell systems. An increase in developmental potential is observed when adult stem cells are stimulated to divide under regenerative pressure and are exposed to growth factors (Fuchs et al., 2004Fuchs E. Tumbar T. Guasch G. Socializing with the neighbors: Stem cells and their niche.Cell. 2004; 116: 769-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). However, it is not known—for any system—whether changes in cell cycle dynamics cause or are a consequence of the increased potency. Nevertheless, while the patterning processes of regeneration have been studied extensively in many systems, we are not aware of any study that has performed a comprehensive cell cycle analysis of regenerating cells. Because younger cells are more developmentally plastic, it is widely assumed, without rigorous testing, that regeneration reprograms the cells to a younger state. In newt limb and eye retinal regeneration, for example, blastema cells have been described as undergoing dedifferentiation and “rejuvenation” (Tanaka, 2003Tanaka E.M. Cell differentiation and cell fate during urodele tail and limb regeneration.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the imaginal disc, previous studies have questioned this interpretation. Regenerating disc cells, like regenerating vertebrate cells, spend more time in S phase than their neighboring cells (Kiehle and Schubiger, 1985Kiehle C.P. Schubiger G. Cell proliferation changes during pattern regulation in imaginal leg discs of Drosophila melanogaster.Dev. Biol. 1985; 109: 336-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, Johnston and Schubiger, 1996Johnston L.A. Schubiger G. Ectopic expression of wingless in imaginal discs interferes with decapentaplegic expression and alters cell determination.Development. 1996; 122: 3519-3529PubMed Google Scholar). But this in itself does not define the developmental age of a cell. In fact, several observations argue against rejuvenation. First, in the fly embryo, the selector gene vg is activated and is both necessary and sufficient for the initiation of wing development. However, when wing is formed as a consequence of leg to wing TD, an enhancer that is specific to later development (the second and third larval instars) activates vg (Williams et al., 1994Williams J.A. Paddock S.W. Vorwerk K. Carroll S.B. Organization of wing formation and induction of a wing-patterning gene at the dorsal/ventral compartment boundary.Nature. 1994; 368: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, Maves and Schubiger, 1998Maves L. Schubiger G. A molecular basis for transdetermination in Drosophila imaginal dsics: interactions between wingless and decapentaplegic signaling.Development. 1998; 125: 115-124PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the question of rejuvenation has been addressed using fly mutants for a variegating phenotype (yellow [y]). The phenotype (y versus wild-type) of a cell is fixed at random in the late embryo and then clonally propagated. When TD is induced after the variegated phenotype has been established, disc cells retain their y or wild-type phenotype, indicating that TD does not rejuvenate cells back to the late embryo (Hadorn et al., 1970Hadorn E. Gsell R. Schultz J. Stability of a position-effect variegation in normal and transdetermined larval blastemas from Drosophila melanogaster.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1970; 65: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Such findings suggest that multipotency occurs in the genetic context of an “older” developmental stage. Today, we have experimental tools to revisit TD and answer fundamental questions about how cells switch fates. We monitor TD by genetically marking TD cells with a GFP reporter. With this technique, we can define exactly when and where determined leg cells switch to wing determination and follow them all the way through differentiation. In imaginal discs, the cell cycle profile, size, and doubling time are well characterized, and we can establish a cell’s age with an accuracy of about 8 hr (Graves and Schubiger, 1982Graves B.J. Schubiger G. Cell cycle changes during growth and differentiation of imaginal leg discs in Drosophila melanogaster.Dev. Biol. 1982; 93: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, Neufeld et al., 1998Neufeld T.P. de la Cruz A.F. Johnston L.A. Edgar B.A. Coordination of growth and cell division in the Drosophila wing.Cell. 1998; 93: 1183-1193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). We have taken advantage of these metrics to test whether an increased developmental potential requires a recapitulation of a “young” cellular state by analyzing the cell cycle changes that accompany regeneration and TD. Here, we provide evidence that when cells regenerate or transdetermine they do not convert to a younger cell cycle. However, cells that transdetermine acquire a novel cell cycle profile that exhibits some characteristics of younger cells and other characteristics of older cells. As in other model systems, when Drosophila imaginal discs regenerate only a few cells near the wound proliferate and reform the missing structures (Kiehle and Schubiger, 1985Kiehle C.P. Schubiger G. Cell proliferation changes during pattern regulation in imaginal leg discs of Drosophila melanogaster.Dev. Biol. 1985; 109: 336-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, Tanaka, 2003Tanaka E.M. Cell differentiation and cell fate during urodele tail and limb regeneration.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These cells are known as the regeneration blastema. Through clonal analysis, it is estimated that about three to five founder cells form the blastema and the regenerated structure (Gehring, 1967Gehring W. Clonal analysis of determination dynamics in cultures of imaginal disks in Drosophila melanogaster.Dev. Biol. 1967; 16: 438-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, Girton and Russell, 1980Girton J.R. Russell M.A. A clonal analysis of pattern duplication in a temperature-sensitive cell-lethal mutant of Drosophila melanogaster.Dev. Biol. 1980; 77: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Do blastema cells become younger? Because cell cycle profiles and doubling times change over development, we can compare these parameters in the regeneration blastema with control discs of different larval ages, and determine if blastema cells indeed “rejuvenate.” We used a fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) to measure the proportion of cells in G1, S phase, and G2 and characterized the age of disc cells. With this technique, we confirmed that control leg disc cells exit S phase and accumulate in G2 as the larva approaches metamorphosis (Figure 1A ; Graves and Schubiger, 1982Graves B.J. Schubiger G.

Biol. 1982; 93: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, Neufeld et al., 1998Neufeld T.P. de la Cruz A.F. Johnston L.A. Edgar B.A. Coordination of growth and cell division in the Drosophila wing.Cell. 1998; 93: 1183-1193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) and that younger leg disc cells are larger than older ones (data not shown; Neufeld et al., 1998Neufeld T.P. de la Cruz A.F. Johnston L.A. Edgar B.A. Coordination of growth and cell division in the Drosophila wing.Cell. 1998; 93: 1183-1193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Finally, we calculated cell doubling times of clones in control leg discs. We confirmed previous estimates that at 25°C, leg disc cells have a 6 hr doubling time during the first half of the third instar, a 9 hr doubling time during the mid-third instar, and a 12 hr doubling time during the late third instar (Graves and Schubiger, 1982Graves B.J. Schubiger G. Cell cycle changes during growth and differentiation of imaginal leg discs in Drosophila melanogaster.Dev. Biol. 1982; 93: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on these controls, we defined the age of cells in the regeneration blastema. To induce regeneration, we fragmented leg discs from late wandering larvae, about 5 hr before puparium formation (−5 hr after puparium formation [APF]) and cultured the fragments in vivo. When a leg disc was cut into a 3/4 lateral piece (3/4L), only cells near the horizontal cut proliferated to form the regeneration blastema (Figure 1B). Other cells, including the entire posterior compartment, did not regenerate and thus were considered to be nonblastema. After culturing the fragments, we separated the nonblastema from the blastema and compared their cell cycles and sizes by FACS. In nonblastema cells, the proportion of cells in S phase was low (Figure 1B). Nonblastema cells did not arrest in G2, however, as seen in normal development. Instead, our observations indicated that the cell cycle arrested in both G1 and G2. Blastema cells, on the other hand, maintained a cell cycle profile that was similar to that of control leg discs at −5 hr APF. In addition, blastema cells were significantly larger than nonblastema cells (Figure 1B). Doubling time analysis of GFP-marked cell clones indicated that cells in the regeneration blastema never reverted to a fast 6 hr doubling time (140 clones analyzed in 12 blastemas; doubling times range from 10.7 hr to 36 hr). These results demonstrate that blastema cells, in terms of their cell cycle profile, do not become younger, but rather maintain the age corresponding to the time of fragmentation. It was possible to test this “status quo” hypothesis of blastema cells, since we know that the cell cycle program changes predictably over larval development and regeneration can be induced anytime during embryonic, larval, or prepupal stages (Schubiger, 1968Schubiger G. Anlageplan, Determinationszustand und Transdeterminationsleistungen der männlichen Vorderbeinscheibe von Drosophila melanogaster. Wilhelm Roux’s Arch. EntwMech.Org. 1968; 160: 9-40Google Scholar). We induced regeneration in leg discs of larvae at 84 hr after egg deposition (AED; “young” discs) and at 0 hr APF (“old” discs) by surgically cutting the discs and cultured the fragments for either 2, 3, or 6 days. After the culture period, we separated the blastema from the nonblastema cells. Blastema cells all exhibited the same cell cycle profile, independent of the developmental age when the disc was cut. The cell cycle profile was also independent of the length of time in culture. Blastemas from old discs did not maintain the distinctive high G2 value (Figure 1C), and likewise, blastemas from young discs did not maintain the low G2 value (Figure 1D). We conclude that no matter when during development regeneration is induced, blastema cells proliferate with a common cell cycle, and the increase in developmental potential is achieved without reverting to a “younger” cell cycle. Clonal analysis has shown that when a disc is fragmented, blastema cells first regenerate missing structures, and only then can some regenerating cells proceed to transdetermine; therefore, the increase in developmental potential of blastema cells is a sequential process (Gehring, 1967Gehring W. Clonal analysis of determination dynamics in cultures of imaginal disks in Drosophila melanogaster.Dev. Biol. 1967; 16: 438-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, Wildermuth, 1968Wildermuth H. Autoradiographische Untersuchungen zum Vermehrungsmuster der Zellen in proliferierenden Rüsselprimordien von Drosophila melanogaster.Dev. Biol. 1968; 18: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Though TD occurs in all imaginal discs, in this study we focus specifically on leg to wing TD for several reasons. First, detailed fate maps have been generated for both leg and wing discs. These fate maps allow us to define the precise disc cells that transdetermine from leg to wing (Schubiger, 1971Schubiger G. Regeneration, duplication and transdetermination in fragments of the leg disc of Drosophila melanogaster.Dev. Biol. 1971; 26: 277-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, Bryant, 1975Bryant P.J. Pattern formation in the imaginal wing disc of Drosophila melanogaster: fate map, regeneration and duplication.J. Exp. Zool. 1975; 193: 49-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar); proximal-dorsal leg cells transdetermine into pleura, a ventral wing structure. Second, leg to wing TD is well characterized at the molecular level. Misexpression of wingless (wg) induces a specific subset of TD events that are observed in fragmentation experiments (Maves and Schubiger, 1995Maves L. Schubiger G. Wingless induces transdetermination in developing Drosophila imaginal discs.Development. 1995; 121: 1263-1272PubMed Google Scholar, Johnston and Schubiger, 1996Johnston L.A. Schubiger G. Ectopic expression of wingless in imaginal discs interferes with decapentaplegic expression and alters cell determination.Development. 1996; 122: 3519-3529PubMed Google Scholar). For example, in ventral discs of the larva, such as leg, ectopic wg activates the wing selector gene vg via a defined regulatory element, the vg boundary enhancer (vgBE), in a small group of cells in the dorsal leg disc that have high levels of endogenous decapentaplegic (dpp) expression (Maves and Schubiger, 1998Maves L. Schubiger G. A molecular basis for transdetermination in Drosophila imaginal dsics: interactions between wingless and decapentaplegic signaling.Development. 1998; 125: 115-124PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, upon ubiquitous wg expression, vgBE is activated only in dpp-expressing cells, in the dorsal-proximal aspect of the leg disc (the weak point). The activation of vgBE is both necessary and sufficient to induce leg to wing TD; animals with an allelic deletion of vgBE still form some wing structures, but have a very low frequency (2%) of leg to wing TD (Kim et al., 1996Kim J. Sebring A. Esch J.J. Kraus M.E. Vorwerk K. Magee J. Carroll S.B. Integration of positional signals and regulation of wing formation and identity by Drosophila vestigial gene.Nature. 1996; 382: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, Maves and Schubiger, 1998Maves L. Schubiger G. A molecular basis for transdetermination in Drosophila imaginal dsics: interactions between wingless and decapentaplegic signaling.Development. 1998; 125: 115-124PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we can monitor disc cells that transdetermine from leg to wing by using the vgBE-Gal4 UAS-GFP reporter, referred to here as the vgBE GFP reporter. We induced leg to wing TD in two different ways, either by fragmenting leg discs (Figure 2A ) or by ubiquitously overexpressing wg in early third instar larvae (Figure 2D). In both experiments, we saw that the vgBE GFP reporter was activated in leg discs, in the weak point, with high frequencies (Figures 2B and 2E). To verify that the GFP expression reflected real TD, we transplanted samples of vgBE GFP-expressing leg discs into host larvae to allow the discs to differentiate adult structures (Figures 2C and 2F). Selecting leg discs that expressed vgBE GFP increased the frequencies of cuticle TD compared to frequencies we reported previously (Schubiger, 1971Schubiger G. Regeneration, duplication and transdetermination in fragments of the leg disc of Drosophila melanogaster.Dev. Biol. 1971; 26: 277-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, Maves and Schubiger, 1998Maves L. Schubiger G. A molecular basis for transdetermination in Drosophila imaginal dsics: interactions between wingless and decapentaplegic signaling.Development. 1998; 125: 115-124PubMed Google Scholar). However, the frequency of TD in the adult cuticle was still lower than the frequency of vgBE GFP observed in leg discs, possibly because wing-specific cuticular structures were more difficult to find than GFP. Nevertheless, the vgBE GFP reporter reliably reported changes of selector gene expression in leg disc cells that transdetermined to wing and terminally differentiated wing structures. We conclude that whether TD is induced physically or genetically, it is a predictable event with respect to site and frequency. wg overexpression induces outgrowth of cells that transdetermine (Johnston and Schubiger, 1996Johnston L.A. Schubiger G. Ectopic expression of wingless in imaginal discs interferes with decapentaplegic expression and alters cell determination.Development. 1996; 122: 3519-3529PubMed Google Scholar). Does wg signaling first affect cell cycle or cell fate, and is one dependent on the other? Because leg to wing TD occurred with a high frequency and always at dorsal sites of the leg disc, we defined the sequence of events using the vgBE GFP reporter and monitored the cell cycle over a three day time period. We dissected leg discs immediately after the induction of wg and 1 day, 1.5 days, 2 days, and 3 days later (Figures 3A–3E ). During normal leg disc development, cells divide asynchronously throughout the disc (Kiehle and Schubiger, 1985Kiehle C.P. Schubiger G. Cell proliferation changes during pattern regulation in imaginal leg discs of Drosophila melanogaster.Dev. Biol. 1985; 109: 336-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After wg was ubiquitously overexpressed, we observed that this pattern of cell division continued for 1 day (Figures 3A and 3B). However, 1.5 to 2 days later, proliferation was maintained only in dorsal regions of the leg disc (Figures 3C and 3D). Strikingly, we observed some discs in which S phases were localized exclusively to cells in a small area, the weak point. This was observed in leg discs before the vgBE GFP reporter was expressed (Figure 3C). Over time, as the vgBE GFP reporter was activated and the area of vgBE GFP expression increased, the area of cells in S phase and mitosis spread beyond the vgBE GFP region (Figures 3D and 3E). By day 3, the frequency of vgBE GFP expression plateaued, and S phase and mitoses were observed throughout the dorsal and anterior aspects of the disc (Figure 3E). These results demonstrate that the cell cycle shift occurs before the vgBE GFP reporter is induced and indicate that the cell cycle change precedes TD (Figures 3F and 3G). To determine if cell cycle profiles correlated with the initial phase of TD, we performed FACS analysis to compare the profiles of TD and non-TD cells at two times: 2 days and 3 days after wg induction. After 2 days, TD cells had many more in S phase and fewer in G1 compared to non-TD cells. TD cells were also larger than non-TD cells (Figure 3H). After 3 days, however, no cell cycle differences between TD and non-TD cells were observed, and the change in cell size was reversed (Figure 3I). Thus, in the early phase, when the frequency of TD was still increasing, we observed that TD cells had a cell cycle profile that was never observed in normal development. Later, when the frequency of TD plateaued, the TD cells lost their unique cell cycle profile, again indicating a transient shift in cell cycle and size in TD cells. It is interesting to note that wg overexpression did not induce a cell cycle or size change in the cells that express vg in the wing discs (data not shown). Thus, the transient cell cycle was only observed in leg discs that transdetermined and was not simply a result of wg overexpression. This indicates that TD has two distinct phases: initiation and maintenance. During the initial phase, we observed the activation of vgBE GFP and a distinct cell cycle and cell size profile in the weak point (Figure 3C). Later, the TD cells continued to divide, expanding the GFP area and propagating the TD wing state with a cell cycle and size profile that was not different from their neighboring leg cells. These data verify that a small number of founder cells participate in the initial TD event and that upon TD, the newly achieved state of determination is propagated (Gehring, 1967Gehring W. Clonal analysis of determination dynamics in cultures of imaginal disks in Drosophila melanogaster.Dev. Biol. 1967; 16: 438-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To exclude an artifact of wg overexpression, we performed FACS on leg discs in which TD was induced by fragmentation. After a short culture period (2 days), TD cells were larger than non-TD cells and again had a novel cell cycle profile with fewer cells in G1 and more in S phase. After a longer culture period (4 days), the TD and non-TD populations shared the same cell cycle and cell size profiles (data not shown). Thus, both protocols produced a transient cell cycle profile. In the stem cell literature, observations of ectopic gene expression have been used as proof of fate changes. However, in many of the reported cases of hematopoietic stem cell plasticity, for example, the putatively transdifferentiated cells have not been shown to produce a functional new, terminally differentiated cell type (Raff, 2003Raff M. Adult stem cell plasticity: fact or artifact?.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, Wagers and Weissman, 2004Wagers A.J. Weissman I.L. Plasticity of adult stem cells.Cell. 2004; 116: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Imaginal discs allow us to test the differentiation of cells that switch determination. Previously our lab has shown that leg discs that ubiquitously overexpress wg not only transdetermine to wing, but also duplicate leg structures, forming a new posterior compartment. For simplicity, we call leg duplication a form of regeneration (Johnston and Schubiger, 1996Johnston L.A. Schubiger G. Ectopic expression of wingless in imaginal discs interferes with decapentaplegic expression and alters cell determination.Development. 1996; 122: 3519-3529PubMed Google Scholar). We reported here that when discs transdetermine, cells proliferated throughout the entire dorsal half of the disc, both inside and outside of the vgBE GFP expression domain (Figures 3D and 3E). Based on this reproducible vgBE GFP expression and cell proliferation pattern, we predicted that we could use dorsal-ventral disc morphology to distinguish the three disc regions that vary in their degree of developmental potency: TD cells (multipotent), R (regenerating) cells, and NR (nonregenerating) cells (unipotent).

The collecting duct portion of the mammalian renal tubule regulates water and solute transport via the action of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP). 1The abbreviations used are: AVP, arginine vasopressin; AQP, aquaporin; CaM, calmodulin; IMCD, inner medullary collecting duct; TFP, trifluoperazine; RT, reverse transcription; AC, adenylyl cyclase; TG, transglutaminase; MDC, monodansylcadaverine; CTX, cholera toxin; dDAVP, [deamino-Cys-1,d -Arg-8]vasopressin. 1The abbreviations used are: AVP, arginine vasopressin; AQP, aquaporin; CaM, calmodulin; IMCD, inner medullary collecting duct; TFP, trifluoperazine; RT, reverse transcription; AC, adenylyl cyclase; TG, transglutaminase; MDC, monodansylcadaverine; CTX, cholera toxin; dDAVP, [deamino-Cys-1,d -Arg-8]vasopressin. AVP is released from the posterior pituitary in response to elevated plasma osmolality and binds to V2 receptors on the basolateral surface of the collecting duct epithelium, triggering a G-protein-linked signaling cascade, which leads to an elevation of cAMP and water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) vesicle insertion into the apical plasma membrane (1.Knepper M.A. Nielsen S.

Desai R.A. Hoffert J.D. de Lanerolle L.P. Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49026-49035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this paper, we sought to identify a role for CaM in regulating more proximal events in the collecting duct response to vasopressin, which could have an effect on other collecting duct functions including urea and Na+ transport. Given that CaM is known to regulate a wide range of cellular processes, it is reasonable to assume that this protein could act at multiple levels in the vasopressin-signaling pathway. One of the major secondary messengers that is increased in response to AVP is cAMP. Elevation of cAMP is required for AQP2 vesicle exocytosis (4.Katsura T. Verbavatz J.M. Farinas J. Ma T. Ausiello D.A. Verkman A.S. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7212-7216Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) as well as the corresponding increase in collecting duct water permeability (5.Grantham J.J. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1966; 211: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Other collecting duct proteins regulated by cAMP include urea transporter UT-A1 (6.Zhang C. Sands J.M. Klein J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F85-F90Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and the epithelial sodium channel (7.Morris R.G. Schafer J.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Measuring cAMP in enriched IMCD fractions, we found that elevation of cAMP in response to AVP requires CaM. Further analysis suggested that CaM is acting at the level of adenylyl cyclase. This is the first demonstration of CaM-dependent cAMP accumulation in response to AVP in intact IMCD tubules, which supports prior conclusions from studies in cultured LLC-PK1 cells (8.Ausiello D.A. Hall D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9796-9798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse outer medulla (9.Takaichi K. Kurokawa K. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F834-F840PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we present evidence showing that CaM is required for AVP-mediated urea permeability in isolated perfused IMCD, another process that is cAMP-dependent (10.Star R.A. Nonoguchi H. Balaban R. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 81: 1879-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), suggesting that CaM may play a broader regulatory role in the collecting duct than initially thought. We utilized RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry to look for the presence of a CaM-sensitive adenylyl cyclase (AC) isoform in IMCD cells. Of the nine mammalian AC isoforms identified, three have been shown to be calmodulin-sensitive: AC1, -3, and -8 (11.Defer N. Best-Belpomme M. Hanoune J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F400-F416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AC1 and -8 are expressed mainly in tissues of the central nervous system, whereas AC3 has a broader profile, having been found in olfactory neuroepithelium (12.Xia Z. Choi E.J. Wang F. Storm D.R. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 144: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), testes (13.Defer N. Marinx O. Poyard M. Lienard M.O. Jegou B. Hanoune J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), brown adipose tissue (14.Chaudhry A. Muffler L.A. Yao R. Granneman J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: R755-R760PubMed Google Scholar), and uterus (15.Mhaouty-Kodja S. Bouet-Alard R. Limon-Boulez I. Maltier J.P. Legrand C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31100-31106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrated the presence of a single CaM-sensitive adenylyl cyclase isoform in IMCD, namely AC3. In the collecting duct, AC3 may act as the target cyclase for Ca2+/CaM-dependent cAMP accumulation in response to vasopressin. Animals—Pathogen-free male Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farm Inc., Germantown, NY) were maintained on an autoclaved pelleted rodent chow (413110-75-56, Zeigler Bros., Gardners, PA) and ad libitum drinking water. All experiments were conducted in accordance with an animal protocol approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the NHLBI, National Institutes of Health (ACUC protocol number 2-KE-3). Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) knock-out mice and wild-type mixed background mice, a kind gift of Dr. Gerry Melino (University of Roma, Italy) (16.Vincenzo de L. Melino G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), were maintained on the same autoclaved pelleted rodent chow and ad libitum drinking water. Immunoblotting as well as PCR amplification of tail genomic DNA was used to distinguish knock-out from wild-type mice. All mouse experiments were conducted in accordance with animal protocol H-0047 approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the NHLBI. Materials—Monodansylcadaverine (MDC), TFP, forskolin, and cholera toxin (CTX) were from Sigma. W-7 was from Calbiochem. Cyclic AMP enzyme immunoassay kit was from Cayman Chemical. Adenylyl cyclase antibodies, AC3 (C-20, sc-588) and AC5/6 (C-17, sc-590), were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and were used at the manufacturer's recommended dilutions. Both affinity-purified aquaporin-1 (L266) (17.Terris J. Ecelbarger C.A. Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F414-F422PubMed Google Scholar) and aquaporin-2 (L127) (18.Nielsen S. DiGiovanni S.R. Christensen E.I. Knepper M.A. Harris H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11663-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) antibodies have been described previously. IMCD Suspensions—IMCD suspensions were prepared from inner medulla of rat kidney using the method of Stokes et al. (19.Stokes J.B. Grupp C. Kinne R.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F251-F262PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications (20.Chou C.L. DiGiovanni S.R. Luther A. Lolait S.J. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F78-F85PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were killed by decapitation, and whole inner medullas were removed and finely minced with a razor blade. Minced tissue was incubated for 90 min at 37 °C with gentle agitation in a collagenase/hyaluronidase solution to dissociate individual tubule segments. After incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 80 × g for 30 s to enrich for heavier IMCD structures followed by centrifugation of the supernatant at 1500 × g for 5 min to pellet the lighter non-IMCD fragments. Pellets were resuspended in either bicarbonate buffer (118 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 4 mm Na2HPO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose) for measurement of cAMP or Laemmli buffer for immunoblotting. Measurement of cAMP—Fifty-microliter aliquots of IMCD suspensions were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min with 0.5 mm isobutyl methylxanthine in the presence or absence of various CaM inhibitors followed by incubation with 0.1 nm AVP for 5 min. Samples were pelleted at 1000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant was discarded. Tissue pellets were lysed by adding 0.2 n HCl and incubating for 20 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation at >10,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were saved for measuring cAMP, and pellets were used to measure protein content (BCA assay, Pierce). cAMP content was measured using a non-radioactive enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) based on competitive binding between endogenous cAMP and an exogenous cAMP-tagged acetylcholinesterase tracer. Samples were run in 96-well microtiter plate format and measured at λ = 414 nm on a plate reader (Labsystems Multiskan MCC/340). Absorbance data were analyzed using a spreadsheet program provided by Cayman Chemical, which calculated cAMP content in pmol/ml. This value was then normalized to total protein, which had been measured previously using the BCA assay. The final value was expressed as fmol of cAMP/μg of protein. Isolated Perfused IMCD Tubules—IMCD segments were microdissected from the mid-region of the inner medulla (40–70% of the distance from the inner-outer medullary junction to the papillary tip of the rat kidney). The tubules were transferred to a perfusion chamber, mounted on an inverted microscope, cannulated by concentric pipettes, and perfused in vitro. The perfusate and the peritubular bath solutions were identical to the dissection solution, except that in the bath solution, 5 mm creatinine was replaced by 5 mm urea. The urea permeability was determined by measuring the urea flux resulting from the transepithelial urea gradient. The urea concentrations in the perfusate, bath, and collected fluid were measured fluorometrically using a continuous flow ultramicrofluorometer and an enzymatic assay (Infinity urea nitrogen reagent, catalogue number TR12321, ThermoTrace). RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from rat IMCD and brain using the guanidinium thiocyanate/cesium-trifluoroacetic acid method. Potential contaminating genomic DNA was removed from the RNA preparations by a 30-min incubation with DNase I (DNA-free, Ambion). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) and Superscript II RT (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. RT-negative controls were performed to assess the presence of possible genomic DNA contamination of RNA samples. PCR primers were designed against the corresponding cDNAs of rat adenylyl cyclases 1–9 to generate products of ∼200–500 bp in size. All primers were designed to span at least one intronic region to distinguish possible amplification of genomic DNA. All amplified products were confirmed by sequencing. dDAVP Infusion—Under methoxyflurane anesthesia (Metofane, Pitman-Moore, Mundelein, IL), osmotic minipumps (model 2002, Alzet, Palo Alto, CA) were implanted subcutaneously in Brattleboro rats to deliver 20 ng/h dDAVP (Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Collegeville, PA), a V2 vasopressin receptor-selective agonist. Brattleboro rats used as controls were implanted with minipumps containing vehicle (saline) alone. After 7 days of dDAVP or vehicle infusion, during which time rats received water and pelleted chow ad libitum, all rats were killed by decapitation. Immunoblotting and Immunohistochemistry—Tissue samples were homogenized in isolation solution (10 mm triethanolamine, 250 mm sucrose, pH adjusted to 7.6, Roche protease inhibitor tablet) using a mechanical tissue grinder (Omni International), and total protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Samples were then solubilized in Laemmli buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1.5% SDS, 6% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 40 mm dithiothreitol). 15–50 μg of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE (21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205516) Google Scholar) and immunoblotting as described previously (22.Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13550-13559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat kidneys were perfusion fixed, paraffin-embedded, and processed for immunostaining via horseradish peroxidase as described previously (23.Hoffert J.D. van Balkom B.W. Chou C.L. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F170-F179Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Statistics—Quantitation of changes in cAMP as well as densitometric analysis of protein immunoblots are expressed as the mean ± S.E. (n ≥ 3) for each group. Unpaired t tests or analysis of variance were performed as appropriate for the given data set. Effect of CaM Inhibition on AVP-stimulated cAMP Accumulation in Rat IMCD—To address the role of CaM in regulating cAMP production in response to vasopressin, we incubated rat IMCD cell suspensions with three different CaM inhibitors: MDC (24.Cornwell M.M. Juliano R.L. Davies P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 762: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), W-7 (25.Nishikawa M. Tanaka T. Hidaka H. Nature. 1980; 287: 863-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and TFP (26.Sugden M.C. Christie M.R. Ashcroft S.J. FEBS Lett. 1979; 105: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Following a 10-min preincubation period with these compounds in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutyl methylxanthine (0.5 mm), 0.1 nm AVP or vehicle (bicarbonate buffer) was added to the tubules for 5 min. cAMP content was subsequently measured by a non-radioactive enzyme immunoassay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” cAMP levels were significantly increased 4–5-fold in IMCD suspensions incubated with AVP alone (Fig. 1). Preincubation of tubules with MDC (200 μm) completely abolished AVP-stimulated cAMP accumulation in IMCD cells (61.2 ± 17.5 versus 529.3 ± 52.7 (AVP alone) fmol cAMP/μg of protein) (Fig. 1A). Preincubation of tubules with two other CaM inhibitors, W-7 (25 μm) (165.4 ± 33.1 versus 378.5 ± 19.2 (AVP alone) fmol/μg) and TFP (30 μm) (174.5 ± 37.4 versus 378.5 ± 19.2 (AVP alone) fmol/μg), also significantly reduced the increase in cAMP because of AVP treatment. Increasing the concentration of these drugs to 100 μm gave an even greater inhibition (Fig. 1B), demonstrating the dose dependence of this phenomenon. CaM Inhibitors Act at the Level of Adenylyl Cyclase—Although our results indicated that CaM was required for elevation of cAMP by vasopressin, it was unclear at what level CaM was affecting the signaling pathway (e.g. V2 receptor, Gs, or adenylyl cyclase). Incubation of IMCD suspensions with 1 μg/ml CTX, a potent ADP-ribosyltransferase that causes persistent activation of Gsα, produced a 4.6-fold increase in cAMP that was blocked by either W-7 (25 μm) or TFP (30 μm) (Fig. 2A). The fact that CaM inhibitors block CTX-mediated cAMP elevation rules out the V2 receptor as the site of action of Ca2+/CaM, and suggests that CaM is probably acting either at the level of Gsα or of the adenylyl cyclase responsible for cAMP production in the IMCD. Forskolin is a direct activator of nearly all known adenylyl cyclase isoforms (11.Defer N. Best-Belpomme M. Hanoune J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F400-F416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of IMCD cells with forskolin (1 μm) resulted in a nearly 10-fold increase in cAMP, which was significantly decreased by preincubation with MDC (638.3 ± 45.3 versus 2076 ± 390.4 (forskolin alone) fmol/μg) (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained when tubules were preincubated with W-7 or TFP prior to stimulation with forskolin (data not shown). These results indicate that CaM is acting beyond the level of Gsα, viz. on the adenylyl cyclase responsible for most cellular cAMP production itself. Effect of MDC on cAMP Accumulation in Wild-type and TG2 Knock-out Mice—Previous studies have shown that both MDC and W-7 can inhibit transglutaminase in addition to calmodulin (24.Cornwell M.M. Juliano R.L. Davies P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 762: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27.Sundan A. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Both MDC and W-7 possess a high degree of structural similarity (Fig. 3) and can act as primary amine substrates for cross-linking by transglutaminase. To determine whether these inhibitors are acting through transglutaminase, we obtained TG2 knock-out mice (Dr. Gerry Melino (16.Vincenzo de L. Melino G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar)), which lack both transcript and protein for the major isoform expressed in IMCD. 2J. D. Hoffert, C.-L. Chou, R. A. Fenton, and M. A. Knepper, unpublished observations. IMCD from wild-type mixed background and TG2(–/–) mice produced similarly elevated levels of cAMP in response to AVP (Fig. 4). Preincubation with MDC blocked AVP-induced cAMP responses in both wild-type and TG2(–/–) mice to a similar extent, suggesting that these inhibitors are not acting through promiscuous inhibition of transglutaminase and that transglutaminase activity is not required for elevation of cAMP by vasopressin.Fig. 4Effect of MDC on cAMP accumulation in wild-type (WT) and transglutaminase 2 knock-out mice. MDC inhibits AVP-stimulated cAMP accumulation in both wild-type and TG2 (–/–) mice.

Our previous studies have demonstrated a clear role of calmodulin in regulation of water permeability at the level of aquaporin trafficking (2.Chou C.L. Yip K.P. Michea L. Kador K. Ferraris J.D. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36839-36846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 3.Chou C.L. Christensen B.M. Frische S. Vorum H. Desai R.A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 49026-49035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); however, no clear role for calmodulin had been identified for AVP-stimulated urea permeability. To address this, we isolated rat IMCD segments by microdissection and utilized the perfused tubule method described under “Experimental Procedures” to measure changes in collecting duct urea permeability in response to AVP. The transepithelial urea permeability of isolated tubules was increased following the addition of 0.1 nm AVP to the bath solution (45.7 ± 0.9 (basal) versus 116.7 ± 19.2 (AVP) × 10–5 cm/s) (Fig. 5). The subsequent addition of W-7 (25 μm) dramatically reduced urea permeability to basal levels (AVP + W-7 = 26.3 ± 11.3 × 10–5 cm/s). The addition of W-7 prior to stimulation with AVP also reduced urea permeability (14.7 ± 3.8 (W-7) versus 21.7 ± 5.8 (W-7 + AVP) × 10–5 cm/s). More importantly, urea permeability increased upon washout of W-7 with fresh AVP solution (AVP washout = 92.0 ± 7.8), demonstrating the reversibility of this process. Identification of Adenylyl Cyclase Isoforms in Rat IMCD by RT-PCR—To determine which isoforms of adenylyl cyclase are present in rat IMCD, specific primer sets were generated for each AC isoform (1–9) using sequences obtained from the full-length cDNA of the corresponding gene. Total RNA was extracted from tissue and used for reverse transcription reactions in the presence or absence of reverse transcriptase (Fig. 6, RT+ and RT–, respectively) followed by amplification by PCR. Rat brain was utilized as a positive control for all primer sets, and bands of the appropriate size were present for each AC isoform (Fig. 6, top panel). In all reactions without RT, the band is absent. This eliminates the possibility that bands in RT+ reactions represent amplified contaminating genomic DNA. Analysis of rat IMCD revealed the presence of the majority of AC isoforms except AC1 and -8 (Fig. 6, bottom panel). Most importantly, the only CaM-stimulated isoform of adenylyl cyclase detectable by RT-PCR was AC3. AC3 Is Enriched in IMCD Cells—Rat inner medullas were processed as described under “Experimental Procedures” to generate two fractions: IMCD cells and non-IMCD cells. The former is enriched in collecting duct fragments, and the latter possesses mainly thin limb segments and vasa recta. To assess the level of enrichment, protein lysates from each fraction were analyzed by immunoblotting for AQP1, a water channel present in thin descending limbs and vasculature but absent from IMCD. As expected, AQP1 was much more abundant in the non-IMCD fraction. The immunoblot band densities for AQP1 were increased 5.4-fold in non-IMCD fractions compared with IMCD fractions (p < 0.001; n = 3) (Fig. 7A), suggesting that the IMCD pellet is devoid of a large amount of contaminating non-IMCD material. An affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal AC3 antibody recognized two distinct bands between 160 and 250 kDa that were enriched 2.2-fold in IMCD fractions compared with non-IMCD (p < 0.05; n = 3) (Fig. 7B). This antibody was raised against the highly divergent COOH terminus of rat AC3 (PAAFPNGSSVTLPHQVVDNP, sequence confirmed by mass spectrometry) and does not cross-react with AC1, -2, -4, -5, -6, or -9 (13.Defer N. Marinx O. Poyard M. Lienard M.O. Jegou B. Hanoune J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Both the number and size of bands are consistent with immunoblot results of AC3 expression in myenteric ganglia (28.Liu C.Y. Jamaleddin A.J. Zhang H. Christofi F.L. Brain Res. 1999; 826: 253-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, these two bands, along with a smaller band under 160 kDa, were present in a sample of whole brain homogenate (Fig. 7B). All bands were absent with preadsorption of the AC3-blocking peptide (data not shown). The presence of AC3 protein on immunoblot supports the data generated by RT-PCR analysis and also demonstrates that this isoform is enriched in the collecting duct fraction of the inner medulla. To further address the presence of AC3 in IMCD, we performed immunohistochemistry on rat inner medullary sections. AC3 was found in all IMCD cells, with a lower level of staining present in thin limb cells (Fig. 8A). This staining was largely ablated by preadsorption of the AC3 antibody with its corresponding blocking peptide (Fig. 8B). As expected, AC6, the major isoform identified previously by RT-PCR in more proximal portions of the collecting duct (29.Chabardes D. Firsov D. Aarab L. Clabecq A. Bellanger A.C. Siaume-Perez S. Elalouf J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19264-19271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), was also found in IMCD (Fig. 8C). We have demonstrated previously that AC6 protein is present in the IMCD by immunocytochemistry (30.van Balkom B.W. Hoffert J.D. Chou C.L. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F216-F224Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both AC3 and -6 appear to have similar distributions. Collecting duct staining was confirmed using an antibody to the collecting duct-specific marker protein AQP2 (Fig. 8D). The presence of AC3 in IMCD directly demonstrates the presence of aCa2+/CaM-stimulated isoform in the IMCD and supports our conclusion that Ca2+/CaM may act directly on adenylyl cyclase to enhance AVP-stimulated cAMP production. Effect of Long-term dDAVP Administration on AC3 Expression—A prior study has shown that AC6 expression in the collecting duct is reduced during long-term dDAVP treatment, thought to be the result of a conditioned “negative feedback” response (30.van Balkom B.W. Hoffert J.D. Chou C.L. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F216-F224Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To address whether AC3 is similarly affected by dDAVP, Brattleboro rats were given dDAVP (20 ng/h) or saline (control) via osmotic minipumps for 7 days followed by isolation of inner medulla and immunoblotting. AQP2 was used as a positive control for the effect of dDAVP in collecting duct. AQP2 protein abundance was significantly increased 2.5-fold with dDAVP treatment (100 ± 2.7 control versus 247.7 ± 8.6 dDAVP; p < 1 × 10–5) (Fig. 9, bottom panel). AC3 protein abundance decreased 2.9-fold (100 ± 12.3 control versus 34.5 ± 8.6 dDAVP; p < 0.01) during long-term dDAVP treatment (Fig. 9, top panel). AC6 expression was reduced 5-fold (100 ± 11.7 control versus 19.8 ± 2.9 dDAVP; p < 0.0002) (Fig. 9, middle panel). This result suggests that AC3 and -6 expression may be subject to similar long-term regulatory influences in IMCD cells. Vasopressin acts via the V2 receptor to increase water and urea permeability in the inner medullary collecting duct of the kidney. Water and urea are transported via different channels (31.Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F204-F213PubMed Google Scholar). Water transport occurs via AQP2 in the apical plasma membrane and aquaporins 3 and 4 in the basolateral plasma membrane (32.Nielsen S. Frokiaer J. Marples D. Kwon T.H. Agre P. Knepper M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 205-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Regulation of water transport occurs via vasopressin-mediated AQP2 trafficki"

The underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be understood, and we propose here a specific role for the Tyr-992 residue of EGFR and examine its regulation by the phosphatase, SHP2. The -fold increase in phosphorylation of Tyr-992 in response to IR is twice that seen with ligand (EGF) binding. Mutation of Tyr-992 blocked completely IR-induced EGFR phosphorylation and reduced activation of the downstream signaling molecule, phospholipase Cγ. IR has previously been demonstrated to inhibit activity of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Following protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibition by sodium vanadate both EGFR expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and A431 exhibited up to an 8-fold increase in the basal level of Tyr-992 phosphorylation, significantly higher than that seen with Tyr-1173, Tyr-1068, and total EGFR Tyr. CHO cells expressing a SHP2 mutant also demonstrated up to an 8-fold increase in the basal level of Tyr-992 phosphorylation. In this study we show the unique association of SHP2 with EGFR in response to IR, with up to a 2.5-fold increase in the direct association of endogenous SHP2 with EGFR-wt in response to 2 gray of IR in both CHO and A431 cells. Mutation of Tyr-992 abolished this response. In conclusion we have identified several differentially activated Tyr residues, one of which is not only more sensitive to activation by IR, translating into differential activation of downstream signaling, but uniquely modulated by the phosphatase SHP2.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; IR, ionizing radiation; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PLCγ, phospholipase Cγ; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RNS, reactive nitrogen species; Gy, gray; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary.1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; IR, ionizing radiation; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PLCγ, phospholipase Cγ; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RNS, reactive nitrogen species; Gy, gray; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. is overexpressed in a variety of human tumors where it has been linked to radiation resistance and poor prognosis (reviewed by Ref. 1Schmidt-Ullrich R.K. Contessa J.N. Lammering G. Amorino G. Lin P.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5855-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We, and others have shown EGFR to be activated by ionizing radiation (IR) resulting in cytoprotective downstream signaling primarily through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, thus enhancing sensitivities of cancer cells to the toxic effects of IR (2Schmidt-Ullrich R.K. Mikkelsen R.B. Dent P. Todd D.G. Valerie K. Kavanagh B.D. Contessa J.N. Rorrer W.K. Chen P.B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a dominant-negative EGFR mutant, EGFR-CD533, disrupts the cytoprotective response by preventing radiation-induced activation of the receptor and its downstream effectors, conferring radiosensitization of tumor cells (3Contessa J.N. Reardon D.B. Todd D. Dent P. Mikkelsen R.B. Valerie K. Bowers G.D. Schmidt-Ullrich R.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 405-411PubMed Google Scholar). Although EGFR has been established as an important molecular target and prognostic marker in cancer therapy, the initial molecular events involved in EGFR activation by radiation are not well understood.The general phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr residues by radiation is a well established phenomenon (2Schmidt-Ullrich R.K. Mikkelsen R.B. Dent P. Todd D.G. Valerie K. Kavanagh B.D. Contessa J.N. Rorrer W.K. Chen P.B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 3Contessa J.N. Reardon D.B. Todd D. Dent P. Mikkelsen R.B. Valerie K. Bowers G.D. Schmidt-Ullrich R.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 405-411PubMed Google Scholar), but there are currently no reports showing the effects of radiation on any specific EGFR Tyr phosphorylation sites. Because the individual Tyr sites demonstrate differing affinities for the many adaptor molecules involved in downstream signaling from EGFR we are particularly interested in which of these sites respond specifically to IR rather than the ligand EGF. Thus, we have addressed the molecular mechanisms of EGFR activation by examining IR- and EGF-induced phosphorylation of specific EGFR Tyr residues in A431 squamous carcinoma cells and EGFR expressing CHO cells.The EGFR autophosphorylation sites Tyr-992 and Tyr-1173 have been shown to play a critical role in the activation of the MAPK cascade following EGF stimulation. Tyr-992 is a high-affinity binding site for phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), and is required for PLCγ activation by EGF (4Rotin D. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Daly R.J. Daum G. Li N. Fischer E.H. Burgess W.H.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5224-5230PubMed Google Scholar). PLCγ activates the Ras/MAPK cascade through inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate production and oscillations in cytosolic (Ca2+) (1Schmidt-Ullrich R.K.

Tyr-1173 serves as a major binding site for Shc, an adaptor protein involved in signaling between EGFR and Ras (9Okabayashi Y. Kido Y. Okutani T. Sugimoto Y. Sakaguchi K. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18674-18678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Batzer A.G. Rotin D. Urena J.M. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Tyr-992 and Tyr-1173 are minor binding sites for Shc and PLCγ, respectively (10Batzer A.G. Rotin D. Urena J.M. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hagg M. Liljegren A. Carlsson J. Ronnstrand L. Lennartsson J. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 10: 655-659PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these two Tyr residues are potentially involved in MAPK activation. In this study we have tested the role of the EGFR in radiation-induced PLCγ and Shc phosphorylation using the specific EGFR kinase inhibitor, AG1478. We also evaluated the role of Tyr-992 and Tyr-1173 in these responses, using EGFR constructs specifically mutated (Tyr-Phe) in these residues.Tyr-992 and Tyr-1173 have also been demonstrated to be binding sites for phosphatases (12Agazie Y.

Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7875-7886Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), which play an important role in Tyr dephosphorylation and hence modulation of EGFR activity. In studies on the radiation-induced radicals on phosphatases, we previously measured radiation-induced reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) at the single cell level by fluorescence microscopy (14Leach J.K. Van Tuyle G. Lin P.S. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Mikkelsen R.B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3894-3901PubMed Google Scholar, 15Leach J.K. Black S.M. Schmidt-Ullrich R.K. Mikkelsen R.B. J. Biol.

ROS/RNS generation occurred within seconds of radiation exposure (1–10 Gy) and persisted for 2–5 min after irradiation. ROS species, such as H2O2, have been shown to induce phosphorylation of the EGFR (4Rotin D. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Daly R.J. Daum G. Li N. Fischer E.H. Burgess W.H. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that ROS/RNS-induced EGFR activation may, in part, be because of PTP inhibition (16Mikkelsen R.B. Wardman P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5734-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 17Kamata H. Shibukawa Y. Shin-Ichi O. Hirata H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1933-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that IR may also activate the EGFR by a similar mechanism of secondary ROS/RNS generation. Preliminary evidence for this includes the demonstration that radiation S-nitrosylates the active site Cys in the PTPs, SHP-1, and SHP-2 (16Mikkelsen R.B. Wardman P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5734-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Sequence specificity in recognition of the EGFR has been shown for PTP1B and SHP2 at Tyr-992 (13Agazie Y. Hayman M.J. Mol.

The modulation of EGFR phosphorylation by both of these phosphatases, however, has only been demonstrated in response to ligand binding. In this study we examined the modulation of EGFR by phosphatases, including the Tyr-992-specific phosphatase, SHP2. We also studied the interaction of SHP2 and EGFR in response to IR in both A431 and CHO cells expressing either wild type EGFR or its Tyr-992 mutation.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—Unless specified otherwise, all reagents were obtained from Sigma.

A431 cells were plated at 4.25 × 105 cells in 6-cm dishes, incubated for 2 days at 37 °C, and serum-starved for 16–18 h (0.5% fetal bovine serum). Cells were then treated at 70–80% confluence with 2 Gy (60Co gamma rays) or 10 ng/ml EGF, as previously described (2Schmidt-Ullrich R.K. Mikkelsen R.B. Dent P. Todd D.G. Valerie K. Kavanagh B.D. Contessa J.N. Rorrer W.K. Chen P.B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. They were plated at 6 × 105 cells/6-cm dish and transfected with the appropriate DNA described below. Following a 24-h recovery period, cells were starved for 16–18 h prior to IR or EGF treatment.Transfection—CHO cells were plated at 6 × 105 cells/6-cm dish, and transfected 24 h later with 1 μg/6-cm dish of DNA (EGFR-wt, -Y992F, or -Y1173F mutants) using Lipofectamine PLUS (according to manufacturer instructions). For SHP2 experiments cells were transfected (as described previously) with 0.5 μg of EGFR or Y992F mutant EGFR plus either carrier DNA, wt-SHP2 or c/s SHP2. Cells were lysed 24 and 48 h following transfection for Western blot analyses.Adenoviral Infection—A431 cells were plated at 4.25 × 105 cells/6-cm dish and cultured at 37 °C for 2 days. Cells were exposed for 3 h to adenovirus containing lacZ, wild type SHP2, or a dominant negative c/s SHP2. The three viruses were tested at multiplicity of infections of 5, 10, and 50. Cells were lysed for Western blot analyses 24 and 48 h following infection.Cell Lysis and Western Blotting—Cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and snap-frozen on dry ice at the appropriate times after treatment. Cells were scraped into a lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1% Triton-X) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 g/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and passed 5 times through a 20-gauge needle and syringe. Samples were centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatant protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay. For whole cell lysates, 5× loading buffer (50 mm NaPO4, 5% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 12.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) was added to lysates to achieve 1× concentration; samples were then boiled for 5 min prior to Western blotting. Equal amounts of protein were fractionated on SDS, 6% polyacrylamide gels and protein was transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. Blots were analyzed by chemiluminescence detection and densitometry. With the exception of Total Tyr(P) (1:2000) and SHP2 (1:2500), all antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1000 in 5% milk, Tris-buffered saline-Tween. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody was diluted 1:2000 and the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was diluted 1:7500, also in 5% milk, Tris-buffered saline-Tween. Blots were stripped with a 62.5 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2% SDS, 0.7% 2-mercaptoethanol solution at 55 °C for 30 min, and reprobed as described.Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed on ice immediately following treatment. 4 μg of anti-EGFR (Ab-15), ERBB2 (Ab-11), or 2 μg of anti-SHP2 antibody was added to 400 μg of lysate in a total volume of 500 μl. After mixing for 2 h at 4 °C, 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads were added to each lysate and mixed for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were rinsed three times with lysis buffer (plus inhibitors). 30 μlof2× loading buffer was added to each sample before boiling for 10 min.RESULTSIonizing Radiation and EGF Differentially Phosphorylate Specific Tyr Residues within EGFR—We have previously shown that radiation activates the EGFR by general phosphorylation of certain Tyr residues, and that inhibition of EGFR phospho-Tyr results in radiosensitization (2Schmidt-Ullrich R.K. Mikkelsen R.B. Dent P. Todd D.G. Valerie K. Kavanagh B.D. Contessa J.N. Rorrer W.K. Chen P.B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 3Contessa J.N. Reardon D.B.

The purpose of this study was to examine specific EGFR Tyr residues with reported links to MAPK cascade activation, and their potential roles in radiation-induced EGFR activation and downstream signaling. To focus on individual phosphorylation sites, phospho-specific antibodies were used against various Tyr residues within the cytoplasmic domain of the EGFR known to be in involved the binding of adapter proteins involved in downstream signaling.Examination of the phosphorylation pattern of individual Tyr residues identified three distinct categories. The first consisted of residues unaffected by either IR or EGF. These residues, e.g. Tyr-1068 and Tyr-1086, exhibited a relatively high basal level of phosphorylation that remained unchanged after exposure to 2 Gy of IR or 10 ng/ml EGF (Fig. 1A; Table I).Table IEGFR tyrosine phosphorylation at specific sites: -fold changes above controlPhosphorylation siteTreatment-Fold change (mean ± S.E.)aMean of n = 4 independent experiments.Mean ratio ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab The second category consisted of Tyr residues more highly phosphorylated by EGF than IR, paralleling the Tyr phosphorylation response of the EGFR as a whole. This included Tyr-845, Tyr-1045, and Tyr-1173. Tyr-845 demonstrated a 11.6-fold increase in phosphorylation compared with the untreated control in response to EGF but only a 6.3-fold increase in response to IR. This results in a 2 Gy/EGF (10 ng/ml) ratio of 0.7 ± 0.1 (Table I). Similarly, phosphorylation of Tyr-1045 was increased 10.7-fold by EGF but only 5.2-fold by IR (Fig. 1B), resulting in a 2 Gy/EGF ratio of 0.5 ± 0.2. Tyr-1173 exhibited a higher basal level of phosphorylation relative to the other Tyr residues, and this was increased 5.7-fold by EGF and 2.7-fold by IR, resulting in a 2 Gy/EGF ratio of 0.6 ± 0.09 (see Table I).Finally we identified one residue, Tyr-992, which was more highly phosphorylated by IR than EGF. IR induced a 10.9-fold increase in Tyr-992 phosphorylation, whereas EGF only induced a 5.8-fold increase. The consequent 2 Gy/EGF ratio was 2.1 ± 0.3 (Fig. 1C and Table I).In time course experiments total EGFR Tyr phosphorylation (Tyr(P)) was increased by up to 3-fold over that of an untreated control by 2 Gy IR in A431 human carcinoma cells (Fig. 2). The peak in phosphorylation occurred at 2 min following irradiation and decreased over the subsequent 8 min. IR induced an almost 6-fold increase in Tyr-992 phosphorylation over that seen in the untreated control and similar to total Tyr(P) of EGFR, phosphorylation peaked at 2 min following IR exposure and decreased over the next 8 min. Exposure to concentrations of EGF (10 ng/ml) that provide comparable changes in EGFR phosphorylation increased total Tyr(P) by up to 6-fold peaking at 5 min, but Tyr(P)-992 was only increased 3-fold (Fig. 2). The kinetics of ligand-induced phosphorylation of Tyr-992 were similar to total Tyr(P), peaking at 5 min and decreasing over the next 8 min. Treatment times for subsequent experiments were chosen to reflect the times of maximal receptor phosphorylation of 2 min for IR and 5 min for EGF (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Kinetics of IR- and EGF-induced Tyr phosphorylation. Kinetics of EGFR phosphorylation (total Tyr(P) or Tyr-992). A431 cells were exposed to 2 Gy IR or EGF (10 ng/ml) and snap-frozen at the times indicated.

The functional importance of these two residues was examined in CHO cells, which do not express EGFR-wt, and are also easily transfected. CHO cells expressing EGFR-wt were compared with cells expressing either EGFR-Y992F or -Y1173F mutants. The pattern of total phosphorylation induced in cells expressing EGFR-wt was similar to that observed in A431 cells. Total Tyr phosphorylation was increased 3.1-fold in response to IR and 6.1-fold in response to EGF (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Mutation of Tyr-992 or Tyr-1173 abolishes radiation-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. CHO cells were transfected with plasmids expressing either wild-type EGFR or a mutant EGFR lacking the Tyr-992 or Tyr-1173 residues. 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with radiation (IR) or EGF as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against (A) total phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr), Tyr-992 (B), or Tyr-1173 (C); all bands shown are 170 kDa. Western blots were stripped and reprobed for EGFR to verify equal protein loading (D). Untransfected CHO cells showed no bands at 170 kDa, regardless of treatment (not shown). Mean–fold changes are shown ±S.E. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of either mutant abolished the radiation-induced increase in total Tyr phosphorylation, whereas the EGF-induced increase was only reduced by 50% (Fig. 3A). As expected, no significant signal relative to control levels was observed when the antibody against Tyr-992 (Fig. 3B) or Tyr-1173 (Fig. 3C) was used in combination with cells expressing the corresponding mutants, verifying the specificity of both mutant and antibody. Although CHO cells expressing EGFR-wt showed both radiation- and EGF-induced increases in Tyr-992 phosphorylation, the effect of radiation on Tyr-992 relative to Tyr-1173 was not as pronounced in CHO cells as in A431 cells.EGFR Dependence of Radiation-induced PLCγ and Shc Phosphorylation in A431 Cells—Because PLCγ and Shc have been shown to bind to Tyr-992 and Tyr-1173 with subsequent activation of the MAPK cascade (4Rotin D.

Biol. 1995; 15: 593-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); thus, the phosphorylation of these particular sites was examined.Using the same time and dose strategies as before, a mean 6.2-fold induction of PLCγ phosphorylation was observed following radiation treatment (Fig. 4). Increases in phosphorylation of Shc family members were observed following irradiation; the mean -fold changes (n = 3) were 2.3, 3.0, and 3.5 for the 66-, 52-, and 46-kDa isoforms, respectively. For both PLCγ and Shc, EGF at 10 ng/ml induced a significantly greater increase in phosphorylation than IR (p < 0.05). Pretreatment of cells with 500 nm AG1478, a specific inhibitor of EGFR Tyr phosphorylation (29Osherov N. Levitzki A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 255: 1047-1053Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar), abolished the radiation- and EGF-induced activation of both PLCγ and Shc in A431 cells. Levels of total PLCγ and Shc were not significantly altered by AG1478. Phosphorylation of Src at Tyr-416, a measure of Src activation, was not modulated by radiation, EGF, or AG1478. Thus, EGFR activation is essential for phosphorylation of PLCγ and Shc, but not Src, in response to both IR and EGF in A431 cells.Fig. 4EGFR dependence of radiation-induced PLCγ and Shc phosphorylation.A, cells were pretreated with 500 μm AG1478 for 1 h prior to IR or EGF treatment. Whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analyses using phospho-specific antibodies against PLCγ1 (Tyr-783), Shc (Tyr-317), or Src (Tyr-416). Blots were then stripped and reprobed for total PLCγ1, Shc, or Src. A representative of three independent experiments is shown. B, CHO cells transfected with EGFR-wt, EGFR-Y992F, or EGFR-Y1173F were exposed to 10 ng/ml EGF for 5 min or 2 Gy IR and harvested 2 min later. Cell lysates were subjected to"

In breast cancer, such alteration of cyclin E is a very strong predictor of poor patient outcome. Here we show that alteration in binding properties of these LMW isoforms to CDK2 and the CDK inhibitors (CKIs), p21 and p27, results in their functional hyperactivity. The LMW forms of cyclin E are severalfold more effective at binding to CDK2. Additionally, compared with the full-length cyclin E-CDK2 complexes, the LMW cyclin E-CDK2 complexes are significantly more resistant to inhibition by p21 and p27, despite equal binding of the CKIs to the LMW complexes. When both the full-length and the LMW cyclin E are co-expressed, p27 preferentially binds to the LMW forms yet is unable to inhibit the CDK2 activity. Thus, the LMW forms of cyclin E may contribute to tumorigenesis through their resistance to the inhibitory activities of p21 and p27 while sequestering these CKIs from the full-length cyclin E.

Normal cell division is precisely regulated by checkpoints at distinct junctures in the cell cycle (1Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). The G1/S checkpoint is invariably deregulated in human tumors (2Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (5003) Google Scholar) and is therefore relevant to the process of carcinogenesis. Cells in G1 are normally responsive to extracellular mitogenic stimulation driving them into quiescence or into another round of proliferation (3Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). In cancer cells, this dependence on exogenous signals is uncoupled through a potential myriad of mutations, preventing the cells from exiting the cell cycle (2Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (5003) Google Scholar). Central to the passage of cells through G1 into S phase is the Rb pathway (4Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). This pathway is positively regulated through sequential phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LMW, low molecular weight; MOI, multiplicity of infection; IP, immunoprecipitation; HA, hemagglutinin; CKI, CDK inhibitor; HH1, histone H1. and their associated cyclins. The cyclin D-CDK4 and cyclin D-CDK6 complexes are important in early G1 for phosphorylation of Rb (5Baldin V. Likas J. Marcote M.J. Pagano M. Barteck J. Draetta G.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). The resultant uncoupling of E2F from Rb allows E2F to initiate the transcription of cyclin E and additionally the transcription of S phase genes (10Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 11Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cyclin E in association with CDK2 continues the phosphorylation of Rb, with its levels peaking around the restriction point late in G1 (4Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar, 13Koff A. Cross F. Fisher A. Schumacher J. Leguellec K. Philippe M. Roberts J.M.

This progression through the cell cycle is also negatively regulated by inhibitors of the CDKs (CKIs) such as those of the INK4 family (p16, p15, p18, and p19) that inhibit CDK4 and CDK6 and the Cip/Kip family (p21 and p27) that inhibit CDK2 (reviewed in Ref. 15Sherr C. Roberts J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5178) Google Scholar). Mutations in the cyclins, CDKs, and CDK inhibitors that regulate the RB pathway as well as mutations of Rb itself have been described in most human cancers (2Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (5003) Google Scholar). The tight regulation of cyclin E both at the transcriptional level and by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis indicates that it has a major role for the control of G1/S transition. The recent identification of key substrates for cyclin E-CDK2 complex has increased our appreciation on how cyclin E overexpression seen in many human cancers can lead to genomic instability, a feature common to most solid malignancies. We and others have previously reported that the cyclin E gene is amplified in some breast cancer cell lines (16Keyomarsi K. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1112-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 17Buckley M.F. Sweeney K.J.E. Hamilton J.A. Sini R.L. Manning D.L. Nicholson R.I. deFazio A. Watts C.K.W. Musgrove E.A. Sutherland R.L. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2127-2133PubMed Google Scholar). This amplification can result in as much as 64-fold overexpression of cyclin E mRNA and the protein product, which is constitutively expressed across all phases of the cell cycle (18Sgambato A. Doki Y. Schieren I. Weinstein I.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 393-405PubMed Google Scholar, 19Keyomarsi K. Conte D. Toyofuku W. Fox M.P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 941-950PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to overexpression of the full-length cyclin E 50-kDa protein (found in both normal and tumor cells), we have discovered that some breast cancer cell lines and human breast cancers also express up to five lower molecular weight isoforms of cyclin E (ranging in size from 34 to 49 kDa) (16Keyomarsi K. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1112-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 20Keyomarsi K. O'Leary N. Molnar G. Lees E. Fingert H.J. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 380-385PubMed Google Scholar, 21Keyomarsi K. Herliczek T. Meijer L. Guidet S. Philippe M. Progress in Cell Cycle Research. 3. Plenum Press, New York1997: 171-191Google Scholar, 22Nielsen N.H. Arnerlov C. Emdin S.O. Landberg G. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 74: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We have recently identified the mechanism that is responsible for generating the low molecular weight forms of cyclin E as elastase-mediated cleavage of the N terminus of the full-length cyclin E protein (23Porter D. Zhang N. Danes C. McGrehan M. Harwell R. Farouk S. Keyomarsi K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6254-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We designate the full-length, 50-kDa form of cyclin E as EL. EL2 and EL3 are formed by elastase cleavage between amino acids 40 and 45 of the cyclin E protein followed by further post-translational modification, probably phosphorylation of EL3 to yield EL2. Together, EL2 and EL3 are collectively termed T1. Likewise, EL5 and EL6 are also formed by proteolytic cleavage by elastase at A69 with EL5 containing further post-translational modification, and these two forms are collectively termed T2. In contrast, EL4 is generated from an alternate start site at M46. Of note, EL2,3 (i.e. T1) and EL5,6 (i.e. T2) but not EL4 are expressed only in breast cancer cells with the highest levels of expression found in estrogen receptor-negative tumors. The low molecular weight forms of cyclin E are hyperactive compared with the full-length form both biochemically and biologically. Both T1 and T2 can more efficiently phosphorylate substrates such as histone HH1 or GST-Rb compared with the EL, full-length form, of cyclin E. This hyperactivity associated with the low molecular weight (LMW) forms of cyclin E facilitates the deregulation of the G1 to S transit compared with the full-length form of the protein (23Porter D. Zhang N. Danes C. McGrehan M. Harwell R. Farouk S. Keyomarsi K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6254-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), thus providing a growth advantage to tumor cells. Cytogenetic analysis of MCF-7 cells overexpressing the LMW forms (T1 and T2) of cyclin E shows an increase in polyploidy and tetraploid cells in which the chromosomes contain significantly more structural aberrations (including breaks, fragments, and fusions) along with increased endoreduplication compared with MCF-7 cells overexpressing the full-length (EL) form of cyclin E. Additionally, the cells overexpressing the LMW forms of cyclin E became resistant to anti-estrogen (ICI 182,780) treatment, whereas those expressing the full-length cyclin E remain sensitive (24Akli S. Zheng P.J. Multani A.S. Wingate H.F. Pathak S. Zhang N. Tucker S.L. Chang S. Keyomarsi K. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The LMW forms of cyclin E are also a significant predictor of poor outcome in breast cancer (25Keyomarsi K. Tucker S.L. Buchholz T.A. Callister M. Ding Y. Bedrosian I. Hortobagyi G.N. Knickerbucker C. Toyofuku W. Lowe M. Herliczek T.W. Bacus S.S. N. England J. Med. 2002; 347: 1566-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Cyclin E levels in tumor tissue from 395 patients across all stages of disease were measured using Western blot assay and scored for expression of full-length and LMW isoforms. These levels were then correlated with other established prognostic factors and with disease-specific and overall survival. Cyclin E levels proved to be the most powerful independent predictors for survival in stage I to III breast cancer (25Keyomarsi K. Tucker S.L. Buchholz T.A. Callister M. Ding Y. Bedrosian I. Hortobagyi G.N. Knickerbucker C. Toyofuku W. Lowe M. Herliczek T.W. Bacus S.S. N. England J. Med. 2002; 347: 1566-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The identification of LMW forms of cyclin E generated specifically in tumors due to elastase mediated amino-terminal proteolytic processing poses new questions about the mechanism that underlies their biochemical properties compared with the full-length cyclin E. In this report, we delineate the biochemical differences in activity of the full-length cyclin E compared with its LMW forms with respect to their binding partners, CDK2, p21, and p27, using a baculovirus insect expression system and in tumor tissues from breast cancer patients. Our results show that the LMW cyclin E-CDK2 complexes are significantly more resistant to inhibition by p21 and p27 both in vitro using purified CKIs and in vivo when the CKIs were co-infected with cyclin E and CDK2. Furthermore, we show that under conditions where both the full-length and the LMW forms of cyclin E are present, p21 preferentially binds to the LMW forms of cyclin E and is therefore incapable of inhibiting the full-length cyclin E. Last, we show that breast cancer cell lines and tumors from breast cancer patients overexpressing LMW cyclin E, despite high expression and adequate binding of p21 and p27, do not get inhibited by the CKIs. These results suggest that one of the mechanisms by which the LMW forms of cyclin E mediate their oncogenic potential is through resistance to inhibition by p21 and p27. Culture Conditions for Sf9 Cells—Insect Sf9 cells were cultured in Grace's TNM-FH medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a 27 °C incubator in spinner cultures. For infections, 2 × 107 cells were plated in each 150-mm tissue culture plate and allowed to attach, and medium was changed before infection. Plasmids, Virus Stocks, and Infections—Plasmids pVLCDK2, pV-Lhp27, pVLp21, pVLcycE-EL, pVLcycE-T1, and pVLcycE-T2 were constructed by subcloning the full-length cDNA fragments for CDK2, human p27, p21, the EL forms of cyclin E, and its truncated forms (i.e. T1 and T2), separately, into the multiple cloning sites downstream of the polyhedrin promoter of BaculoGold virus transfer vector pVL1392 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) to generate the expression vectors. Recombinant viruses were produced by co-transfection of these purified plasmids, separately, with linearized BaculoGold virus DNA (PharMingen) into Sf9 insect cells. For the resultant recombinant viruses (CDK2, El, T1, T2, and p27), titers were determined by end point dilution assays. Viruses were amplified by infecting the Sf9 insect cells at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) (0.7) to obtain a high percentage (99%) of the recombinant virus products in the large stock. To obtain protein extracts, cells were scraped off of plates 60 h postinfection, and the supernatants of cell medium containing the amplified viruses were harvested after centrifugation (1100 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) and then stored in 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 250 μl of 1× ppi (250 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride made in Me2SO, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate) and lysed by sonication. High speed supernatants of the lysates were then subjected to Western blotting, immunoprecipitation (IP), histone HH1, and GST-RB kinase analysis, as described below. For in vitro studies, co-infection of the recombinant BaculoGold viruses (CDK2 + cycE-EL, CDK2 + cycE-T1, and CDK2 + cycE-T2) were carried out to obtain the purified protein complexes of CDK2-EL, CDK2-T1, and CDK2-T2. The two desired viruses were mixed together at the same titer and used to co-infect the Sf9 cells at an MOI of 0.7 each. For controls, Sf9 were infected with the CDK2 virus alone. The viral load of the cells was kept constant by the addition of an empty, control vector. For the dose escalation studies, cells were infected with 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 MOI. For in vivo studies, Sf9 cells were infected with three different viruses simultaneously (i.e. CDK2, cyclin E-T1 (or cyclin E-T2), and p27 (or p21)) in order to generate the following protein complexes: CDK2-CycEL-p27 (or p21), CDK2-T1-p27 (or p21), or CDK2-T2-p27 (or p21). The recombinant viruses of CDK2 and the three forms of cyclin E, respectively, were mixed at the same MOI, whereas p27 (or p21) was added in a series of different titers from 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and up to 4 MOI compared with the titer of CDK2. For sequestration study, Sf9 cells were infected with four different viruses simultaneously (i.e. CDK2, cyclin E-EL, cyclin E-T1 (or cyclin E-T2), and p27). The same titer of CDK2, cyclin E-EL, and cyclin E-T1 (or cyclin E-T2) was mixed and added onto Sf9 cells. Two different titers of recombinant viruses p27 (i.e. 1 and 2 MOI of CDK2) were added to investigate the competition. Co-infection of recombinant viruses of CDK2 and cyclin E full-length or its LMW forms (i.e. in the absence of p27 virus) as well as tri-infection of recombinant viruses of CDK2, cyclin E full-length (or its LMW forms), and p27 were also carried out on the same batch of Sf9 cells under the same incubation conditions to serve as controls. For all studies, infections were set up at least three times, and the lysates were consequently subjected to the appropriate experiments described below. Because the results were consistently similar, the figures in this paper are representative of the replicate experiments performed. Western Blot, Immunoprecipitation, and H1 Kinase Analysis—Western blot analysis were performed as previously described (23Porter D. Zhang N. Danes C. McGrehan M. Harwell R. Farouk S. Keyomarsi K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6254-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of protein extracts from each infection condition was electrophoresed on a 10% (FLAG or actin) or 13% (CDK2, p27, p21, and actin) of SDS-poly-acrylamide gels, transferred onto Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked overnight at 4 °C with Blotto (5% nonfat dry milk in 20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 0.25% Tween 20, pH 7.6), washed with TBST (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.6), and then incubated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at 0.75 μg/ml, monoclonal antibodies to CDK2, p27 (PharMingen, San Diego) at 1 μg/ml, monoclonal antibody to p21 (Onco-gene Research Products/Calbiochem) at 1 μg/ml, and monoclonal antibody to actin (Roche Applied Science) at 0.2 μg/ml, all diluted in Blotto. Blots were developed with the Renaissance chemiluminescence system as instructed by the manufacturer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoprecipitation (IP) assays were performed as previously described (23Porter D. Zhang N. Danes C. McGrehan M. Harwell R. Farouk S. Keyomarsi K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6254-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, 300 μg of protein extracts from each condition was immunoprecipitated with anti-CDK2 polyclonal antibody, coupled to Sepharose-protein A beads, washed four times (6000 rpm, 3 min, 4 °C) with 1× lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1× ppi), followed by four washes with 1× H1 wash buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl). The immunoprecipitates were then electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and incubated with anti-CDK2 or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody at 1 μg/ml in Blotto and developed as described above. For in vitro binding assays, purified HA-p27 or HA-p21 (26Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Keyomarsi K. Dynlacht B. Tsai L-H. Zhang P. Dobrowolski S. Bai C. Connell-Crowley L. Swindell E. Fox M.P. Wei N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar) was added, in a series of nine different concentrations from 0 up to 500 μm, to 300 μg of total cell lysate and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min followed by IP with anti-CDK2 antibody and coupling to protein A-Sepharose beads. The HA-p21 and HA-p27 complexes were then subjected to Western blot analysis with either anti-CDK2, anti-p27, or anti-p21 monoclonal antibodies, diluted at 1 μg/ml in Blotto. For the sequestration experiments, 300 μg of protein extracts were first immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-p27 antibody (sc-528; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then incubated with Sepharose-protein A beads and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG or anti-p27 monoclonal antibodies, diluted at 1 μg/ml in Blotto. Kinase assays were performed as previously described (23Porter D. Zhang N. Danes C. McGrehan M. Harwell R. Farouk S. Keyomarsi K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6254-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, 300 μg of protein extract from each condition was used, and following IP with CDK2, p21, or p27, the immunoprecipitates were incubated with 30 μl of kinase assay reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 70 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) that contained 60 μm cold ATP, 5 μCi of [32P]ATP, and 5 μg of histone H1 (Roche Applied Science) or 1.5 μg of GST-Rb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction products were then analyzed on 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (for histone H1) or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (for GST-Rb), stained, destained, dried, and finally exposed to x-ray films. For quantitation purposes, the protein bands corresponding to histone H1 or GST-Rb were then excised and measured for their radioactivity by Cerenkov counting. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection of Human Breast Cancer Cells—T47-D human breast cancer cells were cultured as described elsewhere (27Gray-Bablin J. Zalvide J. Fox M.P. Knickerbocker C.J. DeCaprio J.A. Keyomarsi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15215-15220Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Empty vector pcDNA 4.0 (Invitrogen), cyclin EL1-FLAG, and cyclin E-FLAG constructs Trunk1 (T1) and Trunk2 (T2), described elsewhere (24Akli S. Zheng P.J. Multani A.S. Wingate H.F. Pathak S. Zhang N. Tucker S.L. Chang S. Keyomarsi K. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), were transfected into T47-D cells by using Fugene (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours following transfection, the cells were harvested and subjected to Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and kinase analysis as described above. Breast Tumor Tissue Homogenate Preparation—Approximately 0.1–0.5 mg of the specimen was added to 1 volume of sonication buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, as described (28Harwell R.M. Porter D.C. Danes C. Keyomarsi K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 481-489PubMed Google Scholar). The specimen was then homogenized in a tissue press (Micro-Mincer; Bio-Spec Products, Bartlesville, OK), followed by sonication at 4 °C using a cup-horn adapter. Homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were assayed for protein content, ali-quoted, and stored at -70 °C. 25 μg of lysate were subjected to Western blot analysis using the monoclonal antibodies to cyclin E (HE12) at a concentration of 0.1 μg/ml (29Lees E. Faha B. Dulic V. Reed S.I. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1874-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), p27 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and actin (Roche Applied Science) at final concentrations of 1 μg/ml in Blotto. Immunoprecipitations were also performed using 150 μg of lysate and polyclonal p27 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by Western blots using the cyclin E and p27 antibodies. Histone H1 kinase assays were performed using 300 μg of lysate and polyclonal cyclin E antibody. The reaction products were then analyzed on 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (for histone H1) stained, destained, dried, and finally exposed to x-ray films. The LMW Forms of Cyclin E Are Hyperactive and Have Increased Affinity for CDK2—Using a eukaryotic expression system, we examined the biochemical attributes of LMW cyclin E that could contribute to their enhanced function. For this purpose, we overexpressed full-length cyclin E, its LMW forms, and CDK2 in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system (Fig. 1). Three different cyclin E baculoviruses expressing each of the three FLAG-tagged cyclin E constructs termed EL, T1, or T2 were generated in insect cells. The EL construct codes for the full-length 50-kDa form of cyclin E, the T1 construct codes for the 45- and 44-kDa forms, (termed EL2 and EL3), and the T2 construct codes for the 35- and 33-kDa forms (termed EL5 and EL6). Hence, the forms generated by the T1 and T2 constructs correspond to the endogenous LMW forms that we termed EL2,3 and EL5,6, respectively, in breast cancer cell lines (23Porter D. Zhang N. Danes C. McGrehan M. Harwell R. Farouk S. Keyomarsi K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6254-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Insect cells were co-infected with a constant titer (0.7 MOI) of recombinant baculovirus containing CDK2 and increasing MOI (0.125–2) of either FLAG-tagged cyclin E full-length (cycE EL), cyclin E-T1 (cycE T1), or cyclin E-T2 (cycE T2) cDNAs (Fig. 1). Sixty hours post-infection, cells were harvested and subjected to Western blot (Fig. 1A), histone H1 kinase (Fig. 1B), and immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1C) analyses. Western blot analysis with FLAG and cyclin E confirmed an increasing level of expression of cyclin E-FLAG (EL, T1, or T2), corresponding to increasing MOI (i.e. 0.125–2). Insect cells infected with CDK2 alone (i.e. no co-infection with cyclin E) only express CDK2, as depicted on Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A, CDK2 alone lane). Expression of CDK2 shows a slight increase in the CDK2 levels in cyclin E T1-infected cells. However, immunoprecipitation with CDK2, followed by CDK2 Western blot analysis, clearly shows that equal amounts of CDK2 were immunoprecipitated from each sample independent of the level of expression of cyclin E (Fig. 1C). Kinase assays using histone H1 as substrate showed that at each of the viral titers examined, the truncated forms of cyclin E have greater kinase activity than the EL form (Fig. 1C). After qualitative evaluation of the kinase blots, raw Cerenkov counts were obtained by scintillation counting to quantitatively confirm that the LMW forms of cyclin E have greater kinase activity than the full-length form (Fig. 1B). For example, in the 1 MOI infected cells (Fig. 1B, compare lane 4 in the three panels) the CDK2 activities associated with cycE-T1 and cycE-T2 were 7- and 10-fold higher, respectively, compared with the activity associated with 1 MOI cycE-EL. Overall, in the range of viral titers examined, cycE-T1 and cycE-T2 phosphorylated histone H1 between 2- and 12-fold more effectively than the full-length cyclin E. CDK2 immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that the hyperactivity of the LMW forms of cyclin E was due to their enhanced ability to bind to CDK2 compared with the EL cyclin E. This binding of LMW cyclin E to CDK2 was seen across all titer levels (Fig. 1C). The CDK2 immunoprecipitates that were probed with FLAG are shown after two exposures (the lane with an asterisk denotes a longer exposure time). This was necessary to differentiate the weak binding of the full-length cyclin E from the interference of the IgG band. These experiments suggest that one reason that the LMW forms are hyperactive in their function is through more effective binding to CDK2 compared with the full-length protein. The LMW Forms of Cyclin E Are Resistant to Inhibition by p21 and p27—Next, we characterized the binding of the LMW cyclin E isoforms to the CKIs p21 and p27 (Fig. 2). For these experiments insect cells were co-infected with recombinant baculovirus containing equal amounts of CDK2 and either cyclin E full-length (CycE-EL), T1 (CycE-T1), or T2 (CycE-T2) cDNAs, all at 0.7 MOI. The co-infected insect cells were then homogenized and incubated with increasing concentrations (0–500 nm) of purified HA-p27 (Fig. 2) or HA-p21 (data not shown) for 30 min. The CDK2 complexes were then affinity-purified and subjected to Western blot analyses and kinase assays using either histone H1 or GST-Rb as substrates. All analyses were performed with both HA-p21 and HA-p27. Since very similar results were obtained with both CKIs, we are only showing the detailed analysis of HA-p27. These analyses show that the kinase activity associated with the full-length cyclin E-CDK2 complexes could be readily inhibited by purified HA-p27 using either histone H1 or GST-Rb as substrates (Fig. 2, A–C). Since equal amounts of the LMW isoforms have increased kinase activity compared with equal amount of full-length cyclin E, the kinase activity at each dose of p21 or p27 against the uninhibited cyclin E-CDK2 complex activity was normalized to account for their intrinsic differences in activity (Fig. 2C). This analysis revealed that the IC50 of p21 and p27 for full-length cyclin E-CDK2 against GST-Rb was 25 nm (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the concentrations of p21 and p27 required to inhibit the kinase activity of the LMW cyclin E-CDK2 by 50% were 3–5-fold higher. The trend was similar when HH1 was used as a substrate (EL required less of each CKI to inhibit its activity by 50% compared with T1 and T2), but as would be expected, the differences between the isoforms was not as stratified due to the decreased specificity of the substrate. Furthermore, whether the raw CDK2-associated GST-Rb kinase activity (Fig. 2B) was used to determine the IC50 values or the normalized kinase results (Fig. 2C), the IC50 values were identical, suggesting that the resistance of the LMW forms of cyclin E to CKIs is not due to higher basal activity of these forms as compared with the full-length. Western blot analysis suggests that there was no significant difference in the binding of the p27 to the full-length versus the LMW cyclin E-CDK2 complexes (i.e.Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6). These results suggest that the LMW cyclin E is much more resistant to inhibition by p27 than the full-length cyclin E. Furthermore, the differences in sensitivity to inhibition by CKIs between the full-length and LMW cyclin E is not merely due to the differences in the basal levels or activity of the LMW isoforms of cyclin E; nor is it due to differential binding properties of these proteins. We next examined whether the resistance of the LMW forms of cyclin E to CKIs is evident in intact insect cells (Fig. 3). For these in vivo experiments, insect cells wer"

The recombinant protein is inactive if the purification is done without added phospholipids. The neutral phospholipid, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, preserves Na+,K+-ATPase activity of protein prepared in a Na+-containing medium, but activity is lost in a K+-containing medium. By contrast, the acid phospholipid, dioleoylphosphatidylserine, preserves activity in either Na+- or K+-containing media. In optimal conditions activity is preserved for about 2 weeks at 0 °C. Both recombinant Na+,K+-ATPase and native pig kidney Na+,K+-ATPase, dissolved in n-dodecyl-β-maltoside, appear to be mainly stable monomers (α/β) as judged by size exclusion chromatography and sedimentation velocity. Na+,K+-ATPase activities at 37 °C of the size exclusion chromatography-purified recombinant and renal Na+,K+-ATPase are comparable but are lower than that of membrane-bound renal Na+,K+-ATPase. The β subunit is expressed in Pichia Pastoris as two lightly glycosylated polypeptides and is quantitatively deglycosylated by endoglycosidase-H at 0 °C, to a single polypeptide. Deglycosylation inactivates Na+,K+-ATPase prepared with dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, whereas dioleoylphosphatidylserine protects after deglycosylation, and Na+,K+-ATPase activity is preserved. This work demonstrates an essential role of phospholipid interactions with Na+,K+-ATPase, including a direct interaction of dioleoylphosphatidylserine, and possibly another interaction of either the neutral or acid phospholipid. Additional lipid effects are likely. A role for the β subunit in stabilizing conformations of Na+,K+-ATPase (or H+,K+-ATPase) with occluded K+ ions can also be inferred.

Purified recombinant Na+,K+-ATPase could become an important experimental tool for various purposes, including, hopefully, structural work. The Na+,K+-ATPase is a member of the P-type ATPase family of active cation pumps. Na+,K+-ATPase utilizes the free energy of hydrolysis of ATP to actively transport three intracellular Na+ ions and two extracellular K+ ions in opposite directions across animal cell membranes. Years of investigation have defined the kinetic mechanisms of Na+,K+-ATPase and other P-type ATPases and shown that active transport involves specific cation-catalyzed phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions and E1/E2 conformational changes coupled to the cation movements (1Glynn I.M. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Revs. Biochem. 1990; 59: 171-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Recently available molecular structures of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase provide crucial insights into the mechanism of active transport of all P-type ATPase. The Ca2+-ATPase structure has now been described in five states, corresponding to E1Ca, E1ATP, E1-P, E2-P, and E2, respectively (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 3Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 4Sorensen T.L. Moller J.V.

Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). These demonstrate complex movements of the cytoplasmic domains and trans-membrane segments as one conformation is converted to the next conformation in the catalytic cycle. Homology models based on the Ca2+-ATPase facilitate design of structure-based site-directed mutations and interpretation of experiments in other P-type pumps (7Jorgensen P.L. Hakansson K.O. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Revs. Physiol. 2003; 65: 817-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 8Ogawa H. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15977-15982Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, Ca2+-ATPase structures and homology models are incapable of explaining unique features of other P-type pumps. These include the different cation selectivity of the different P-type cation pumps, the roles of the β subunit in the case of the Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase (9Geering K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and regulatory FXYD proteins (10Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), or binding of specific inhibitors such as cardiac glycosides on Na+,K+-ATPase. Structures of the isolated expressed N domain of Na+,K+-ATPase, have been described recently (11Hakansson K.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 1175-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Hilge M.

Also, native renal or duck salt gland Na+,K+-ATPase preparations have been used for two-dimensional crystallization and cryoelectron microscopy (13Rice W.J. Young H.S. Martin D.W. Sachs J.R.

However, the native proteins are unlikely to be useful for three-dimensional crystallization, due to heterogeneity of glycosylated β subunits and two splice variants of the γ subunit in the renal enzyme (15Kuster B.

Some years ago we initiated expression of Na+,K+-ATPase (porcine α1β1) in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia Pastoris, which can grow to high cell densities and produce high levels of recombinant proteins, including membrane proteins (16Cereghino J.L. Cregg J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 1: 45-66Crossref Google Scholar, 17Beaudet L. Urbatsch I.L. Gros P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Previously, the Na+,K+-ATPase has been expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (18Scheiner-Bobis G. Farley R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1193: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Jorgensen P.L. J. Biol.

Our recent publication describes expression of Na+,K+-ATPase in a protease-deficient strain of P. pastoris and studies of Fe2+-catalyzed oxidative cleavage (20Strugatsky D. Gottschalk K.E. Goldshleger R. Bibi E. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46064-46073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One aim of the project was to express and purify Na+,K+-ATPase in P. pastoris in amounts allowing biophysical or more detailed biochemical work than is possible with other expression systems. In this context, it is of interest that the level of expression in P. pastoris was not strikingly different from that in other expression systems (19Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Jorgensen P.L. J.

However, the high yield of membrane protein, about 1 g from a standard 3-liter culture of P. pastoris, with ouabain binding capacity of about 30 pmol/mg of protein, is a great advantage over the other expression systems. The availability of sufficient material has allowed exploration of optimal experimental procedures to obtain a purified, stable, and functional preparation. This report describes purification of the recombinant Na+,K+-ATPase and provides evidence for specific phospholipid-protein interactions, the oligomeric state of the protein, and role of the β subunit. Materials—P. pastoris protease-deficient strain SMD1165 (his4, prb1) was used for transformation. BMG and BMM media were prepared from YNB medium (Difco) as described in Ref. 20Strugatsky D.

Standard large scale 3l cultures are grown in Bellco Spinner Flasks™ with magnetic stirring and temperature maintained at 25 °C. Membrane Preparations—Cells were broken with glass beads, and membranes were prepared as described previously (20Strugatsky D. Gottschalk K.E. Goldshleger R. Bibi E. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46064-46073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), except that the membranes were incubated for 25 min on ice with 2 m urea and 100 mm KCl prior to the final high speed centrifugation. This urea wash removes about 50% of the membrane-associated protein without affecting the Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Membranes were stored at –80 °C in MOPS-Tris, 10 mm, pH 7.2, EDTA, 1 mm, glycerol, 25% with protease inhibitors. Roughly 1 g of membrane protein is obtained per 3 liters of culture. Renal Na+,K+-ATPase was prepared as described in Ref 23Jørgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar. Purification of Recombinant Na+,K+-ATPase—Urea-treated membranes were homogenized well with n-dodecyl-β-maltoside (DDM, 2:1 w/w) in a medium containing NaCl, 250 mm; Tris·HCl, 20 mm, pH 7.4; imidazole, 5 mm; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm; and glycerol, 10%. The unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation. The soluble material was incubated for 2–12 h at 4 °C with Ni2+-NTA beads, at a ratio of 1 ml of beads per supernatant from 100 mg of membrane protein. For standard preparations, 1 ml of beads was washed with 10 ml of buffers containing NaCl, 250 mm; Tris·HCl, 20 mm, pH 7.4; DDM, 0.2 mg/ml; DOPS (or other combinations of lipid), 0.05 mg/ml; glycerol, 10%; and imidazole, 30 mm (first wash) or imidazole, 60 mm (second wash). The Na+,K+-ATPase was eluted by mixing the beads for 30 min on ice with 1 ml of a solution containing imidazole, 250 mm; NaCl, 100 mm; Tris·HCl, 20 mm, pH 7.4; DDM, 0.2 mg/ml; DOPS (or other combinations of lipid), 0.05 mg/ml; glycerol, 40%. The eluted protein was stored at 0 °C. In some cases KCl replaced NaCl in the elution buffer. Protein was determined either by the Bradford assay or by scanning gels for the α subunit content of the recombinant with known amounts of pig kidney Na+,K+-ATPase. Deglycosylation—The recombinant protein (60 μg) in the elution buffer was incubated with Endo-H (2500 units) overnight on ice. Samples were then applied to gels or size exclusion HPLC. Size-exclusion HPLC for Apparent Mr Determination—DDM-solubilized renal Na+,K+-ATPase or Ni2+-NTA bead purified recombinant Na+,K+-ATPase (∼100 μg of protein) were injected onto a Superdex 200 size-exclusion HPLC column (300 × 10 mm, Amersham Biosciences) using an Ettan LC chromatography system. The protein was eluted at 0.5 ml/min, in a medium containing NaCl, 150 mm; Na-HEPES, 50 mm pH 7.4; DDM, 0.2 mg/ml; and DOPS, 0.02 mg/ml. Fractions were collected in a fraction collector and analyzed for ATPase activity or applied to gels. Apparent Mr values of the eluted Na+,K+-ATPase were calculated from the equation: Elution volume = A*log Mr + B, where A = –4.681 ± 0.315 and B = 22.77 ± 0.723, obtained by linear regression of data on elution of standard soluble proteins. Size-exclusion Chromatography for Stokes Radius Determination and Sedimentation Velocity Experiments—Analytical SEC-HPLC was performed with System Gold from Beckman instruments. A 0.78- × 30-cm TosoHaas TSK-gel G3000SWXL column was equilibrated with 2–3 volumes of buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.2 mg/ml DDM, 0.003 mg/ml DOPS (20 °C)). 100 μl of NaCl 70 mm, 15 mm Tes-Tris (pH 7.4), 7% glycerol containing 8 mg of DDM was added to 4 mg of protein from pig kidney membranes in 500 μl of 250 mm sucrose. After 15 min at 0 °C, the sample was centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 5 min, 4 °C, in a TL-100 rotor, and 500 μl was applied to the column at 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected along the elution profile and stored at 0 °C before sedimentation velocity experiments. Protein standards with Stokes radii (RS) known to be unchanged in the presence of DDM (24le Maire M. Champeil P. Møller J.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 86-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) were used to calibrate the column in the same buffer as above: ferritin (6.3 nm), bovine γ globulin (5.2 nm), chicken ovalbumin (2.8 nm), and equine myoglobin (1.9 nm). Partition coefficients (KD) were determined with KD = (Ve – Vo)/(Vt – Vo), where Ve is the elution volume of the proteins. Thyroglobulin and vitamin B-12 were used as markers of void volume (Vo) and total volume (Vt), respectively. The calibration standard curve RSversus KD was used to interpolate the RS of Na+,K+-ATPase·DDM complex. Sedimentation Velocity Experiments—These were made on two subsequent fractions at 1.04 and 0.87 mg/ml of the main peak of the chromatography or directly after its solubilization followed by 5-min centrifugation at 40,000 rpm from the membranes. The sedimentation profiles were obtained every 5 min at 42,000 rpm and 10 °C for a minimum of 3 h, using absorbance at 278 nm and interference optics. The data were analyzed using the c(s) analysis of the software SEDFIT (25Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3024) Google Scholar) available at www.analyticalultracentrifugation.com (input values: partial specific volume of 0.76 ml/g, viscosity of 1.35 cp, density of 1.007 ml/g, and frictional ratio of 1.25; the confidence level for the regularization procedure was 0.7), and the interpretation of the s values was carried out as described recently (26Winstone T.L. Jidenko M. le Maire M. Ebel C. Duncalf K.A. Turner R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 32: 437-445Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The ratio J/A of the signal in the fringe of interference and absorbance was analyzed considering E0.1% = 0.962, from the protein sequence, and the values for the refractive index (Δn/dc) of 0.186, 0.143, and 0.132 ml/g for protein, detergent and lipid, and sugar, respectively. (Δn/dc) = Jλ/cl, where λ is the laser wavelength (675 nm), c the particle concentration, and l the path length. Binding of [14C]DDM—[14C]DDM was added to about 100 μg of the HPLC peak 2 of the pig kidney Na+,K+-ATPase, or to elution buffer without protein, and concentrated by centrifugation on a Centricon 100 ultrafiltration filter. The [14C]DDM in the retentate without protein was subtracted from that with protein, and the excess of bound DDM was calculated per milligram of protein. DDM micelles have a molecular mass of 60–70 kDa and the majority of unbound DDM (∼85%) is not retained. Kidney Lipids—The kidney lipids were extracted from pig renal cortex membranes with chloroform/methanol, and the extract was dried and redissolved in chloroform (see Ref. 29Kates M.

SDS-PAGE and Western Blots—12–25 μg of yeast membranes was mixed with 5-fold concentrated sample buffer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and separated on 10% Tricine SDS-PAGE (27Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10460) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie, scanned with an imaging densitometer (GS-690, Bio-Rad), and analyzed using the Multi-analyst software (Bio-Rad). Immunoblots were blotted with anti-KETYY antibodies, which recognize the C terminus of the α subunit, or with anti-β antibodies raised against the extracellular domain of the β subunit (28Capasso J.M.

Na+,K+-ATPase activities were assayed at 0 °C using [γ-32P]ATP, routinely at 2 μm final concentration (see Refs. 19Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Jorgensen P.L. J. Biol.

Usually 1 μl of recombinant enzyme (≈0.2–0.4 μg of protein) was added to 100 μl of the reaction medium. Initially, DDM and lipid, at concentrations equal to that in the elution buffer, were added to the reaction media, but later it was found that they can be omitted. For measurement of the Km for ATP at 37 °C the concentrations were varied from 5 to 500 μm and data were fitted to a hyperbolic function using Enzfitter. Mass Spectrometry—The β subunits bands identified on un-fixed gels after staining with Gelcode, were electroeluted with 0.05% SDS, and the SDS was replaced with 1% deoxycholate prior to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis (described in detail in Ref. 30Montigny C.

The clones α/his-β, his-α/β, and his-α/his-β were transfected into the strain P. pastoris and His+ and mutS clones were selected, cells were grown, membranes were prepared, and expression of the α subunit was examined by immunoblots (see Ref. 20Strugatsky D.

The α subunit was not expressed in the his-α/β or his-α/his-β clones, but was expressed well in α/his-β clones. Different α/his-β clones showed wide variations in α subunit levels (20Strugatsky D.

The clone expressing the highest level of α subunit was selected and grown up in large spinner bottles. Table I presents ouabain binding capacity, Na+,K+-ATPase activity, and calculated turn-over numbers for representative membrane preparations expressing α/β (without a His tag) or α/his-β subunits. The values are quite similar, and the turnover numbers are close to expected values for renal Na+,K+-ATPase (23Jørgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Thus, the His tag did not significantly affect expression levels or activity.Table INa+,K+-ATPase activity, ouabain binding, and turnover numbers of membrane-bound recombinant porcine Na+,K+-ATPase (α1/β1 or α1/his10β1)Ouabain bindingNa+,K+-ATPaseTurnover numberpmol/mg proteinμmol/min/mg proteinmin-1α1/β130.250.2287536α1/his10-β123.40.177272 Open table in a new tab Of three non-ionic detergents, C12E10, Fos-choline-12, and DDM, compared for efficiency of solubilization of the yeast membranes and preservation of Na+,K+-ATPase activity, DDM was found to be the optimal detergent. In a medium containing 250 mm NaCl, 2 mg/ml DDM, and 1 mg/ml membrane protein, ∼70% of the Na+,K+-ATPase was dissolved and activity was preserved. At DDM:protein ratios higher than 2:1 w/w, Na+,K+-ATPase was progressively inactivated, although the activity could be preserved by adding soya bean phospholipid (e.g. 0.5 mg/ml lipid with 5 mg/ml DDM). The latter finding provided the first indication for a lipid requirement, but solubilization was done routinely at 2 mg/ml DDM without added lipid, which was found to interfere with binding of the protein to Ni2+-NTA beads. Fig. 1 presents the results of a single-step purification of the DDM-solubilized recombinant Na+,K+-ATPase using Ni2+-NTA chromatography. The detergent-soluble Na+,K+-ATPase was mixed with Ni2+-NTA beads overnight at 4 °C, and the beads were then washed with increasing concentrations of imidazole. The Coomassie-stained gel shows representative fractions of proteins eluted with 5, 30, and then 60 mm imidazole, and at 250 mm imidazole the Na+,K+-ATPase was eluted (α and β subunits are marked). Elution of α together with the His-tagged β subunit indicates the presence of an intact α/his-β complex. As we reported previously (20Strugatsky D. Gottschalk K.E. Goldshleger R. Bibi E. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46064-46073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the β subunit is expressed as two quite sharp bands by comparison with the typical broad band in the native pig kidney Na+,K+-ATPase marked PKE. The α and β subunits were also easily identified in Western blots (right lane). Judging by scans of gels like that in Fig. 1 the purity of the eluted Na+,K+-ATPase is in the range 30–50%. In elution buffers containing DDM without added phospholipids, the α/his-β complex has no Na+,K+-ATPase activity. The finding that added soya bean phospholipid preserves ATPase activity of membranes dissolved at a higher DDM concentration suggested that lipid may be required. It has also been reported that addition of phosphatidylserine maintains activity of C12E8-solubilized Na+,K+-ATPase (31Hayashi Y. Mimura K. Matsui H. Takagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 983: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To test the effects of phospholipids, synthetic DOPC, a neutral phospholipid, or synthetic DOPS, an acid phospholipid, or mixtures of DOPC and DOPS, were added to the washing and elution buffers, and their ability to preserve Na+,K+-ATPase during storage at 0 °C was compared (Fig. 2). Previously we have observed instability and cleavage of the α subunit in yeast membranes prepared in K+-containing media. 2D. Strugatsky and S. J. D. Karlish, unpublished data. Also solubilization of the membranes with DDM in 250 mm KCl rather than NaCl does not preserve the activity well (not shown). Thus, the effects of the added phospholipids were also compared for media containing either 100 mm NaCl or 100 mm KCl, conditions that should stabilize either E1Na or E2(K) conformations, respectively (1Glynn I.M. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Revs. Biochem. 1990; 59: 171-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 9Geering K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The result in Fig. 2 was both surprising and highly informative. Protein eluted with DOPC in a Na+-containing medium shows Na+,K+-ATPase activity at 0 °C, and activity is maintained constant for about 2 weeks. When eluted with DOPC in the K+-containing medium the initial activity was lower, and it was lost within 2 days. By contrast when the protein was eluted with DOPS or mixtures of DOPC/DOPS the initial Na+,K+-ATPase activity was higher, and there was no significant difference between the Na+-containing and K+-containing media. During storage over 2 weeks the mixture DOPC/DOPS preserved activity somewhat better than DOPS alone. However, the more remarkable observation is that, although either DOPC or DOPS maintained activity in the sodium-containing medium, only the DOPS stabilized the protein against inactivation in the K+-containing medium. The protein in the experiment of Fig. 2 was eluted in the presence of 1 mg/ml DDM plus 0.5 mg/ml lipid, but it was found subsequently that 0.2 mg/ml DDM plus 0.05 mg/ml phospholipids sufficed. The results in Fig. 2 provide one indication for a direct interaction of the recombinant protein with DOPS (see “Discussion”). As an initial indicator of the functional state of the eluted recombinant enzyme, its Na+,K+-ATPase activity was compared with activities of membrane-bound or DDM-solubilized pig kidney Na+,K+-ATPase at 0 °C. The specific Na+,K+-ATPase activity of the recombinant protein at 0 °C, in the range 25–40 nmol/mg/min, was distinctly higher than that of either the membrane-bound (9 nmol/mg/min) or DDM-solubilized pig kidney Na+,K+-ATPase (12 nmol/mg/min), of comparable purity (≈50%). The apparent paradox of a more active recombinant protein has been resolved by a finding that the difference was due to non-native lipids. When lipids extracted from pig kidney were used for the washing and elution of the recombinant protein, a much lower activity was observed, 11–13 nmol/mg/min, which is in the same range as the membrane-bound or detergent-so"

These mice develop dermal and pulmonary fibrosis. In the present study we explore activation of TGFβ signaling pathways in this strain and examine the profibrotic properties of explanted transgenic fibroblasts including myofibroblast differentiation and abnormal metalloproteinase production. Gene expression profiles of littermate wild type or transgenic fibroblasts were compared using high-density gene arrays and validated by Taqman reverse transcriptase-PCR, Northern and Western blotting. Using a specific inhibitor (SD-208) we demonstrate that the abnormal phenotype of these cells is dependent upon TβRI kinase (ALK5) activity, and that transgenic fibroblasts show enhanced expression and activation of TGFβ together with increased levels of wild type TβRII. Moreover, we confirm that transgene expression is itself regulated by TGFβ and that expression at low levels facilitates signaling, whereas high level expression is inhibitory. For a subset of TGFβ responsive genes basal up-regulation is normalized or suppressed by exogenous recombinant TGFβ1 at time points coincident with increased transgene expression. These findings explain the profound refractoriness of TβRIIΔk-fib fibroblasts to exogenous TGFβ1, despite their activated phenotype. Thus, transgenic fibroblasts recapitulate many hallmark biochemical properties of fibrotic cells, including high level CTGF (CCN2) expression and type I collagen overproduction, altered MMP production, and myofibroblast differentiation. These cells also show an enhanced ability to contract collagen gel matrices.

In addition, several recent studies suggest altered expression of TGFβ pathway signaling intermediates in SSc including Smad3 and Smad7 (14Dong C. Zhu S. Wang T. Yoon W. Li Z.

Gene profiling or PCR-based differential display experiments comparing SSc with healthy control dermal fibroblasts point toward a gene expression pattern for SSc similar to that of TGFβ-activated normal fibroblasts (16Whitfield M.L.

Finally, myofibroblasts are more frequent in SSc skin and lung samples and the myofibroblast phenotype is maintained in explanted cultures from SSc skin or lung biopsies (19Shi-Wen X. Chen Y. Denton C.P. Eastwood M. Renzoni E.A. Bou-Gharios G. Pearson J.D. Dashwood M. du Bois R.M. Black C.M. Leask A. Abraham D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2707-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We have sought to directly test in vivo the hypothesis that sustained alteration in TGFβ signaling or responsiveness in fibroblasts may recapitulate the SSc phenotype. Transgenic mice have been generated for these experiments using a potent fibroblast-specific promoter subcloned from the pro-α2(I) collagen gene (20Denton C.P. Abraham D.J. Autoimmunity Rev. 2004; 3: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) to drive expression of TGFβ receptors. Surprisingly, we achieved our goal of sustained activation of TGFβ signaling by expressing a kinase-deficient type II TGFβ receptor (TβRIIΔk) in fibroblasts. Initial characterization of a novel transgenic mouse strain in which TβRIIΔk is expressed selectively on fibroblasts by linking it a lineage-specific promoter demonstrated development of skin and lung fibrosis (21Denton C.P. Zheng B. Evans L.A. Shi-wen X. Ong V.H. Fisher I. Lazaridis K. Abraham D.J. Black C.M. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25109-25119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our findings were unexpected because kinase-deficient TGFβ receptors have previously been shown to be dominant negative inhibitors of signaling in several experimental systems, albeit at high expression levels compared with wild type receptors (22Bottinger E.P. Jakubczak J.L. Roberts I.S. Mumy M. Hemmati P. Bagnall K. Merlino G. Wakefield L.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2621-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In the present study the fibrotic phenotype of explanted dermal fibroblasts from TβRIIΔk-fib mice is delineated. We determine that expression of the mutant receptor leads to multilevel activation of the TGFβ ligand-receptor axis and that activation is dependent upon endogenous TβRI receptor kinase activity. Two cardinal features of this mouse strain are identified: altered metalloproteinase expression and function, and myofibroblast differentiation. In addition, we confirm that the fibroblast-specific expression cassette is itself regulated by TGFβ and that low level expression of the kinase-deficient TβRII activates TGFβ signaling, whereas higher expression levels are inhibitory. We hypothesize that the profound refractoriness of explanted transgenic dermal fibroblasts to recombinant TGFβ1 is because of transgene up-regulation in ligand-activated cells. It is possible that analogous signaling perturbations may lead to balanced up-regulation of profibrotic pathways and sustain abnormal fibroblast properties in fibrotic disease. If so, then consequences of blocking TGFβ ligand or receptor activity are unpredictable, and animal models such as the TβRIIΔk-fib strain are likely to be valuable tools in the development and evaluation of targeted antifibrotic therapies. Transgenic Mice—The generation and initial characterization of the transgenic mice strains used in this work has been previously described. In brief, a fibroblast-specific expression cassette was subcloned from the upstream region of the pro-α2(I) collagen gene (Col1a2). This incorporates a fragment between –19.5 and –13.5 kb upstream of the transcription start site that, when linked to an endogenous minimal promoter drives gene expression at high levels in fibroblasts, but not in other type I collagen producing cells. Reporter genes linked to this promoter-enhancer show high level fibroblast-specific expression in embryonic development from 8-day post-conception and postnatally, as previously described. The mouse strain TβRIIΔk-fib was generated by subcloning the cDNA encoding the extracellular and transmembrane portion of the human type II TGFβ receptor into the SalI site of the pCD3 expression vector. A bacterial β-galactosidase gene (LacZ) is coexpressed from a dicistronic transgene mRNA product via an encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site sequence. Full details of this construction are provided in Ref. 21Denton C.P. Zheng B. Evans L.A. Shi-wen X. Ong V.H. Fisher I. Lazaridis K. Abraham D.J. Black C.M. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25109-25119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar. Fibroblasts cultured from 6-kb LacZ transgenic mice, in which a bacterial β-galactosidase reporter gene is regulated by the same fibroblast-specific reporter transgene as the TβRIIΔk-fib strain were used in control experiments (23Denton C.P. Zheng B. Shiwen X. Zhang Z. Bou-Gharios G. Eberspaecher H. Black C.M. de Crombrugghe B. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 712-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fibroblast Culture—Fibroblast cultures were derived from skin biopsies from the lower back of neonatal transgenic or control littermate mice. Cells were cultured in the presence of antibiotics and passaged at confluence. Fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Fibroblasts were subcultured at confluence and used between passages 2 and 5. Fibroblast monolayer cultures were incubated for 16–24 h in serum-free culture medium prior to experiments examining agonist effects. Transgene expression levels were routinely measured by the Galactolight™ biochemical assay of β-galactosidase activity (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA), with normalization of assay data for cell number by assessing DNA concentration in cell or tissue lysates (23Denton C.P.

Transfection of Neonatal Fibroblasts—To assess TGFβ1 signaling pathway activity or responsiveness a series of TGFβ-regulated promoter-reporter constructs were introduced into transgenic or wild type cells by transient transfection, and the effect of recombinant TGFβ1 on reporter gene expression determined. Constructs used for these experiments have been previously described, including PAI-1 (24Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), Col1a2 (23Denton C.P. Zheng B. Shiwen X. Zhang Z. Bou-Gharios G. Eberspaecher H. Black C.M. de Crombrugghe B.

All were linked to a firefly luciferase reporter and plasmids were transfected into neonatal fibroblasts using Lipofectamine Plus™ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Assessment of luciferase activity was by the Dual Light™ reporter gene system (Tropix Inc.) with a 1:100 pSV40-LacZ control plasmid. For experiments 70% confluent fibroblast monolayers were used in 24-well tissue culture plates. To determine the effect of TβRIIΔk co-expression on activity, the cDNA encoding TβRIIΔk was subcloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) and cotransfected at concentrations between 10 and 200 ng/tissue culture well with each of these TGFβ-regulated promoter-reporter constructs. Later, to investigate the responsiveness of the fibroblast-specific promoter-enhancer cassette driving TβRIIΔk a series of experiments were performed in which a pCMV-Smad7 was transfected into transgenic fibroblasts from the 6-kb LacZ mouse strain or wild type fibroblasts cotransfected with a plasmid in which the minimal endogenous promoter was replaced by a non-TGFβ responsive herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter as described previously (23Denton C.P.

Western Blot Analysis of Fibroblast Protein Expression—To examine biochemical or functional differences between transgenic or wild type fibroblast cultures and compare responsiveness to recombinant TGFβ1 ligand Western blot analysis was performed. Cell layer lysates and tissue culture supernatants were examined from independent strains derived from transgenic or non-transgenic littermates (n = 5). Supernatants were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation to selectively enrich samples for secreted matrix proteins. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were electroblotted onto nylon membranes and probed with specific antibodies. These were localized by chemiluminescence using a specific secondary antibody. For supernatants, specific antibodies to collagen type I (Southern Biotechnology Inc., Birmingham, AL) were used. Other studies examined CTGF (R&D Systems) and MMP13, TβRI, TβRII, and phosphorylated Smad2/3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) using specific primary antibodies. Mouse-specific primary antibodies were used to ensure that endogenous TβRII rather that truncated TβRIIΔk was detected. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from fibroblasts using the isothiocyanate/cesium chloride method (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) or by TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Levels of specific transcripts were determined by Northern blotting, following separation of RNA on 1% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and capillary transfer to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were hybridized and probed with cDNA fragments specific for pro-α2(I) collagen and CTGF mRNAs as previously described (12Shi-wen X. Pennington D. Holmes A. Leask A. Bradham D. Beauchamp J.R. Fonseca C. du Bois R.M. Martin G.R. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). 18 S rRNA band intensity was used to confirm equal gel loading. Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP to a specific activity of 109 dpm/mg, using the Megaprime™ random priming method (Amersham Biosciences). Levels of transcripts were determined from signal intensity measured by autoradiography. Pharmacological Inhibitor Studies—Pharmacological inhibitors and anti-TGFβ antibodies were used to explore the role of key components of the ligand-receptor axis in determining the abnormal properties of transgenic fibroblasts. A novel, highly specific, inhibitor of the TβRI kinase (SD-208, Scios Inc., Fremont CA) was used to ask whether blocking endogenous TGFβ signaling would abrogate the increase in TGFβ-dependent gene and protein expression in transgenic cells. SD-208 has an IC50 of 49 nmol/liter based on direct enzymatic assay of TGFβRI kinase (ALK5) activity with a specificity of >100-fold against TGFβRII and at least 17-fold over members of a panel of related protein kinases including p38a, p38b, p38d, JNK1, EGFR, MAPKAPK2, MKK6, ERK2, PKC, PKA, PKD, CDC2, and CaMKII. Preliminary experiments defined the effective concentration producing specific ALK5 inhibition. For these experiments fibroblasts were cultured to confluence, incubated in a low serum medium overnight, and then stimulated with recombinant TGFβ1 (4 ng/ml) for between 30 min and 24 h, in the presence or absence of the novel inhibitor. For studies examining regulation of the fibroblast-specific expression cassette by TGFβ1, mithramycin was used to inhibit Sp1 (27Holmes A. Abraham D.J. Chen Y. Denton C.P. Shi-wen X. Black C.M. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41728-41733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and curcumin was used as an inhibitor of AP-1 (28Greenwel P. Inagaki Y. Hu W. Walsh M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 72: 19738-19745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In some experiments the broad spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 was used to block protease activity in monolayer or gel lattice culture (29Karsdal M.A. Larsen L. Engsig M.T. Lou H. Ferreras M. Lochter A. Delaisse J.M. Foged N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44061-44067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of neutralizing antibody against TGFβ (1D11) on transgene expression in TβRIIΔk-fib mice, neonatal animals were injected with 1D11 or the isotype-matched control monoclonal 13C4 (2.5 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and β-galactosidase activity assayed in tail biopsy lysate 48 h later. Quantitative RT-PCR Methods—Fluorescent real-time PCR (Taqman) was used to confirm basal and TGFβ1-induced differences in gene expression. Total RNA was extracted and treated with RNase-free DNaseI, (Roche, Lewes, UK) for 10 min at 37 °C and heat inactivation at 70 °C for 15 min. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using 2 μg of random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences) and 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR were done on the ABI Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) according to previously described methods, with each reaction containing 5 ng of reverse transcribed RNA in 25 μl. 18 S rRNA (primers and probes from Applied Biosystems) were used as an endogenous control to account for differences in the extraction and reverse transcription of total RNA. Affymetrix Genechip Experiments—Total RNA was harvested from confluent fibroblast monolayers (TRIzol, Invitrogen) and quantified, and integrity was verified by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Equal amounts of identically treated RNA were pooled and reverse transcribed (Invitrogen) into cDNA that was then in vitro transcribed into biotinylated cRNA. The target cRNA was then fragmented and hybridized to the mouse U74Av2 array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), covering 12,000 mouse genes, as described by the manufacturer. Hybridization of cRNA, signal amplification, and data collection were performed using a fluidics station and chip reader following the Affymetrix™ protocol. Arrays were scaled to an average intensity of 100 per gene and analyzed using the Affymetrix Microarray Analysis Suite version 5.0. Briefly, transcripts were defined as up-regulated or down-regulated only when identified as “present” and as significantly different (p < 0.001) in two independently probed genechip pairs. The -fold change between treated and untreated samples had to be at least 2.5-fold to designate a transcript as being differentially expressed. Contraction of Free-floating or Fixed Fibroblast Populated Collagen Lattices—To study collagen gel contraction, fibroblasts were cultured within three-dimensional collagen lattices (fibroblast populated collagen lattices; FPCL). These were prepared as previously described (30Shi-Wen X. Denton C.P. McWhirter A. Bou-Gharios G. Abraham D.J. du Bois R.M. Black C.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In brief, 24-well tissue culture plates (Costar) were pre-coated with sterile 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (2 ml/well) by incubation at 37 °C overnight, and were then washed three times with sterile PBS. For FPCL, neutral collagen solution (containing one part of 0.2 m HEPES, pH 8.0; four parts collagen (Vitrogen-100, 3 mg/ml, Celltrix, Santa Clara, CA) and five parts of MCDB 104 medium (Sigma, 2 times concentrate) was prepared and mixed with fibroblasts that were resuspended in 2 times MCDB 104 medium, to bring the final concentration to 80,000 cells and 1.2 mg of collagen/ml. The collagen-cell suspension (1 ml) was added to each well, and allowed to solidify for 1 h. After polymerization, 1 ml of MCDB medium was added to each well, causing detachment of the lattice from the tissue culture plastic, yielding free-floating FPCLs. Measurement of tension across a three-dimensional, free-floating fibroblast-populated collagen lattice was performed as described previously (31Eastwood M. McGrouther D.A. Brown R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 32Tomasek J.J. Gabbiani G. Hinz B. Chaponnier C. Brown R.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar). Briefly, with 1 × 106 cells/ml collagen gel, we measured the force generated across the collagen lattice, by using a tensioning culture force monitor that is capable of measuring the minute forces exerted by cells within a collagen lattice over 24 h as fibroblasts attach, spread, and migrate. The rectangular fibroblast-seeded collagen gel was cast and floated in medium, tethered to two flotation bars on either end of the short edges, in turn attached to an anchor point at one end and a force transducer at the other. Cell-generated tensional forces in the collagen gel were detected by the force transducer and logged into a personal computer. Graphical readings are produced every 10 min, averaged from 600 readings (1 per second), providing a continuous output of force (Dynes) generated (31Eastwood M. McGrouther D.A. Brown R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Immunostaining of Cells and Tissues—Cells were seeded at 4 × 103 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% normal calf serum into chamber slides (Labtek, Nunc; Fisher Scientific UK, Loughborough, UK), grown to subconfluence, made quiescent in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight, and exposed to control media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) or recombinant TGFβ1 (4 ng/ml) for between 3 and 24 h. Parallel experiments were performed with SD-208 to block TβRI kinase (ALK5) activity. The cell monolayer was washed three times with PBS, and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 5 min. Cells were washed three times in PBS before permeabilization and after each later step. Permeabilization was performed using 0.1% Triton in 50 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 90 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 75 mm KCl for 30 s, at room temperature. Chamber slides were incubated with primary antibody specific for phosphorylated Smad2/3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) to examine receptor-regulated Smad activity and localization. Other studies used anti-SMA specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubation with primary antibody or irrelevant control, serum slides were treated with a fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), each for 60 min at room temperature. Nuclei were stained for 1 min in 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After extensive washing with PBS, a single drop of CitiFluor AF1 (Chem Lab, Canterbury, UK) was added and cells were then visualized and photographed using an Axioskop Z fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For immunolocalization of TGFβ in neonatal mouse, skin samples from TβRIIΔk transgenic or wild type littermates were skin snap frozen. Serial frozen sections (5 μm) were cut on a cryostat at –30 °C and air-dried for 1 h. Sections were fixed in ice-cold acetone and covered with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min in the dark to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Slides were then blocked with 20% normal horse serum, and incubated with monoclonal antibody against TGFβ (1D11) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibody was localized using a biotin/streptavidin-based amplifying system. After washing with PBS, sections were incubated with biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG diluted in PBS (7.5 g/ml, BA-9500; Vector Laboratories) for 30 min, rinsed, and finally incubated with Vectastain Elite STR-ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min. Immunolocalization was visualized using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole chromogen and H2O2 as substrate (SK-4200; Vector Laboratories). Sections were then washed in tap water, counterstained with Carrazzis hematoxylin, and mounted with Gelmount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). Specificity of staining was confirmed in control sections incubated with an isotype-matched irrelevant control antibody (13C4) in place of 1D11. TGF-β Bioassay Using Mink Lung Epithelial Cells—To examine TGFβ bioactivity in fibroblast culture supernatants we used a validated bioassay incorporating mink lung epithelial cells stably transfected with a PAI-1 luciferase reporter construct. The assay was performed as described previously (24Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). For each supernatant, aliquot basal activity (active TGFβ) and activity after heating the supernatant at 80 °C for 10 min (total TGFβ) was compared. Samples were analyzed in triplicate. Briefly, 1.6 × 104 per well were plated in 96-well tissue culture dishes. After attachment for 3 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, medium was replaced by test sample and after 14 h at 37 °C luciferase activity was determined. Recombinant TGFβ1 and neutralizing anti-TGFβ antibody (1D11) or isotype matched irrelevant antibody (13C4) were used to verify specificity of the assay. Equal numbers of transgenic or wild type cells were seeded at baseline and luciferase expression data were expressed per unit supernatant volume. Equivalent transgenic or wild type cell number at the time of harvesting the supernatant was confirmed by direct counting. Statistical Analysis—For quantitative variables, mean (±S.E.) in replicate samples or combined independent experiments, where interexperiment variation allowed reliable combination of raw data, were compared. Means were compared by Student's paired or unpaired t test as"

Our latest studies of RLF and LGR8 have revealed that the N-terminal region of the A chain is not required for receptor binding but is indispensable for cyclic AMP generation. RLF derivatives with six residues deleted from the N terminus of the A chain are active, whereas further truncation, up to the first A chain cysteine (A-10), yields tightly binding ligands devoid of signaling activity. These derivatives are specific competitive inhibitors (RLFi) of RLF. Although receptor binding is dependent upon B chain residues, the N-terminal region of the A chain is a generic trigger of the trans-membrane signaling activity.

Insl3–/– male mice retain the testes in the body cavity and are infertile (2Zimmermann S. Steding G. Emmen J.M.A. Brinkmann A.O. Nayernia K. Holstein A.F. Engel W. Adham I.M. Mol.

Thus, an experimental system is now available that invites detailed investigation of the ligand/receptor interaction. RLF, isolated from bovine testes, consists of an A chain comprising 26 residues and a B chain of 40 or 45 residues. The chains are linked by three relaxin-like disulfide bonds (9Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This native RLF confirms the structure that has been implied for all synthetic molecules. RLF binds its receptor in part through the B chain residue Trp(B-27) (10Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and via additional, yet unidentified, residues that would account for the high receptor binding affinity. However, the molecule can be pared down without loss of binding avidity. Full binding intensity, for example, is observed with RLF ending in Trp(B-27)-amide (11Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8021-8028Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that the N-terminal region of the A chain initiates the trans-membrane signal. Sequential shortening of the N-terminal end of the A chain reduces cAMP production, which becomes undetectable when 7 or more residues are removed. A chain truncations did not reduce binding avidity so that Ades-(1–7) RLF is a specific competitive inhibitor of RLF function. In this paper we report that the receptor-binding region of RLF is physically separate from the trans-membrane signal initiation site in the N-terminal region of the A chain. Materials—Fmoc amino acid derivatives were purchased from either Advanced ChemTech (Louisville, KY) or Novabiochem. Reagents and solvents for peptide synthesis were obtained from Advanced ChemTech. The LGR8 cloned into the pcDNA3.1.zeo plasmid was a gift from Dr. Hsueh, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University School of Medicine. The human embryo kidney cell line 293T/17 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-11286) and used for LGR8 expression. Peptide Synthesis—All RLF chains were synthesized by Fmoc chemistry, using an automated peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, model 433A). The C-terminal amino acids were linked to Wang resin. Side chain-protecting groups of all trifunctional amino acids were trifluoroacetic acid-labile, except for methionine (sulfoxide) in position B-5, acetamidomethyl protected cysteines in positions A-11 and B-11, and tertiary butyl protected cysteine in position A-24. O-Benzotriazol-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium-tetrafluoroborate (HBTU) (12Knorr R. Trzeciak A. Bannwarth W. Gillessen D. Tetrahedron Lett. 1989; 30: 1927-1930Crossref Scopus (932) Google Scholar) was used for carboxyl activation. Each polypeptide chain was deprotected and removed from the solid support by treatment with a freshly prepared mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/water/ethanedithiol/thioanisole/phenol (100/5/2.5/5/7.5) (v/v/v/v/w) for 2 h at room temperature (13King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 36: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). The resin was filtered off, the peptide was precipitated with ice-cold diethylether, the pellet was collected by centrifugation, washed two times with diethylether, air-dried, resuspended in water, and lyophilized. Each RLF chain was purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a Rainin C18-column (41.4 mm × 250 mm) using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 83% acetonitrile (solvent B) at a flow rate of 40 ml/min. The peptide was eluted using a 30-min linear gradient and detected by UV light absorbance of the effluent. Fractions of 10 ml were collected, and 10 μl of each fraction analyzed for homogeneity by HPLC on a Bakerbond column (see below). Fractions containing the pure peptides were pooled and lyophilized. The distribution of the cysteine-protecting groups allowed for the stepwise synthesis of the three disulfide bonds. In the A chain, cysteines A-10 and A-15, liberated during the trifluoroacetic acid treatment, were oxidized by titration with iodine in 50% acetic acid (peptide concentration = 10 mg/ml). Excess iodine was immediately reduced with 1 m ascorbic acid in water. The reaction mixture was diluted with water to <20% (in acetic acid) and purified by preparative HPLC. The fractions containing the pure peptide were pooled and lyophilized. To convert cysteine (tert-butyl) (A-24) to the 2-pyridylsulfenyl derivative the protected A chain (17 μmol) and 2,2′-dipyridyl disulfide (Aldrich) (240 μmol) were dissolved in 900 μl of trifluoroacetic acid and chilled on ice. Thioanisole (100 μl) and 1 ml trifluoromethanesulfonic acid in trifluoroacetic acid (1:4 v/v) were added, and the reaction continued for 30 min at 0 °C (10Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Maruyama K. Nagata K. Tanaka M. Nagasawa H. Isogai A. Ishizaki H. Suzuki A. J. Protein Chem. 1992; 11: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The A chain was precipitated with chilled diethylether, and the pellet was collected by centrifugation, washed 3× with 10 ml of diethylether, and air-dried. The RLF A chain derivative was dissolved in 1 m acetic acid and desalted on Sephadex G25 sf in 1 m acetic acid and lyophilized. To produce the first interchain disulfide bond, equimolar amounts (4 μmol) of the thiol-activated A chain and the monothiol B chain were reacted in 3 ml of 8 m guanidinium chloride, 0.1 m acetic acid (adjusted to pH 4.5 with NaOH) for 24 h at 37 °C. The product was isolated by size separation on Sephadex G50 sf (2.5 cm × 55 cm) in 1 m acetic acid followed by separation on HPLC on a Jupiter C18-column (10 mm × 250 mm, Phenomenex). The last disulfide bond was formed by oxidative removal of the acetamidomethyl groups in positions A-11/B-11 using iodine in 95% acetic acid as solvent (10Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Maruyama K. Nagata K. Tanaka M. Nagasawa H. Isogai A. Ishizaki H. Suzuki A. J. Protein Chem. 1992; 11: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). After 60 min at room temperature in the dark the reaction mixture was slowly added to a vigorously stirring solution of 0.1 m ascorbic acid. The peptide was isolated by size separation on Sephadex G25 sf in 1 m acetic acid and lyophilized. Lastly, the methionine sulfoxide (B-5) (1.25 μmol) was reduced with 800 μl of 50 mm ammonium iodide in 90% trifluoroacetic acid for 15 min on ice. The reaction was quenched by addition of 10 mm ascorbic acid in water (5 ml), and the peptide was isolated by gel filtration on Sephadex G25 sf in 1 m acetic acid, followed by HPLC purification on a Jupiter C18-column. The solvents were removed by lyophilization.

Open table in a new tab High Performance Liquid Chromatography—Peptides were analyzed in two HPLC systems. For both systems solvent A consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile/water 4/1 v/v. In system 1, ∼10–20 μg of peptide was loaded onto a Bakerbond wide-pore C18-column (4.1 mm × 250 mm). The peptide was eluted with a 30-min linear gradient from 20 to 60% B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The UV light absorbance of the effluent was recorded at 220 nm. In system 2 an Aquapore 300 column (C8, 2.1 mm × 30 mm) was used in combination with an ABI HPLC model 130A. Approximately 1 μg of peptide was loaded and eluted with a 60-min linear gradient from 20 to 45% B at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. The UV light absorbance of the effluent was recorded at 230 nm. RLF analogs (10 μg) were dissolved in 20 μl of water and reduced with dithiothreitol (20 μl, 50 mm) in 0.2 m Tris/HCl (pH 8.6) containing 6 m guanidinium chloride for 30 min at 37 °C. Glacial acetic acid (5 μl) was added, and the chains were separated by analytical HPLC in system 2. RLF analogs (5 μg) were dissolved in 10 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and digested with Staphylococcal protease V8 (enzyme to substrate ratio (w/w), 1:10) for 16 h at 25 °C (15Drapeau G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) followed by trypsin (enzyme to substrate ratio (w/w), 1:20) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 50 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and was subjected to analytical HPLC on Aquapore 300 using a 40-min linear gradient from 0 to 40% B. Amino Acid Composition—Peptides were hydrolyzed in vapor phase 6 m HCl containing 1% phenol. Amino acids were modified with phenylisothiocyanate and separated by HPLC, using the Waters Pico.Tag system. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry was performed at the mass spectrometry facility at the Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston. The RLF analog (1 μg), dissolved in 1 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid or 1 μl of the enzymatic digest, was mixed with 3 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (50 mm in acetonitrile/water 4/1 v/v), and 1 μl was spotted on a sample plate. Mass spectra were acquired on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) Voyager DR-STE instrument in the linear mode. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—RLF derivatives (∼0.5 mg/ml) were dissolved in water, and the protein content was determined accurately by UV spectroscopy, using calculated absorbance coefficients. An aliquot of 25 μg of RLF analog was diluted to 300 μl with a Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5, 25 mm final concentration) for spectroscopic analysis. A Jasco J710 spectropolarimeter was used to acquire far-ultraviolet CD spectra at a resolution of 0.2 nm and a bandwidth of 2 nm. A cell of 0.1-cm path length was used, and 10 spectra were averaged. Molar ellipticity was calculated according to the literature (16Adler A.J. Greenfield N.J. Fasman G.D. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 675-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Cells (293T/17) were stably transfected with LGR8-pcDNA3.1.zeo, using TransFast transfection reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The selected clone expressed 8700 receptors/cell and was used between passage 20 and 45. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, catalog number 11995-065) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA), 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 400 μg/ml zeocin (Invivogen, San Diego, CA) in a water-saturated atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen), and 107 cells used to seed a 75-cm2 culture flask. Receptor-binding Assay—Transfected 293T/17 cells were grown to 80% confluence and then dislodged with 0.5 m EDTA (pH 7.5, 1 ml/10 ml of conditioned medium) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min, suspended two times in 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg/ml lysine, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.01% NaN3), and recentrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 2000 × g. The pellet was reconstituted to 25 × 106 cells/ml of binding buffer. For binding assays 0.025 pmol of A 125I-labeled Tyr-9 hRLF (17Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22354-22358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in 20 μl of binding buffer was placed into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf vial together with 40 μl of binding buffer with or without human RLF or human RLF derivative and 40 μl (106 cells) of the cell suspension and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. Thereafter the cells were diluted with 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer and collected by centrifugation (10 min at 2000 × g at 4 °C); the pellet was washed with 1 ml of the same buffer and centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 × g at 4 °C. The tips of the vials containing the pellets were placed in counting tubes and transferred to a γ counter for analysis. The total binding was determined in the absence and nonspecific binding in the presence of 32 pmol of unlabeled RLF. In a regular assay, total binding was ∼30,000 cpm, and nonspecific binding amounted to less than 5% of the total binding. Data points were collected in duplicates, and the data of at least 3 independent binding assays were pooled and presented as the mean (± S.E.). Cyclic AMP Assay—Stably transfected LGR8–293T/17 cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates at a density of 250,000 cells/well and grown in 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%) and antibiotics. Twenty-four hours later the conditioned medium was replaced by 100 μl of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (5 mm) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in 5% CO2 before 100 μl of hormone dilution, prepared in the same buffer, was added. The cultures were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air for 16 h. Thereafter the plates were moved into a –80 °C freezer and kept for 6 h at least. Prior to the assay, 20 μl of 0.5 m EDTA was added to each well, the plate was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and the content was transferred into 1.5-ml bullet tubes and heated to >90 °C for 10 min in a water bath. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (100 μl) was reacted with acetic anhydride, and the 2′-O-acyl-cAMP concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay using [125I]succinyl-cAMP-tyrosyl methyl ester (18Steiner A.L. Jaffe B.M. Behrman H.R. Methods of Hormone Radioimmunoassay. Academic Press, New York1979: 3-17Google Scholar) (20,000 cpm = 5 fmol) and anti-cAMP antiserum (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). The total response was determined in the presence of 80 pmol (2.5 μg/ml) of human RLF, and the nonspecific response was determined in the absence of RLF. Assays of hRLF derivatives were compared with human RLF standards run in parallel. Assays were performed in duplicate, and 2–4 independent assays were averaged (± S.E.). In the search for additional receptor-binding residues of human RLF (Fig. 1) we have synthesized RLF derivatives with truncations at the N termini. The yields of the corresponding derivatives and the MALDI-MS data are presented in Table I. All derivatives were homogeneous in two different HPLC systems. Upon reduction, two polypeptides were generated, and the HPLC elution profiles were compared with a human RLF standard treated in parallel. As expected, altered retention times were observed only for the chain carrying the modification. Enzymatic digests and peptide mapping confirmed the parallel arrangement of the peptide chains. Treatment with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, followed by trypsin, liberated the N-terminal A-(9–19)-B-(9–16) and the C-terminal A-(20–26)-B-(21–26) disulfide peptides for all derivatives except for Ades-(1–9), which yielded the N-terminal A-(10–19)-B-(9–16) and AR8A hRLF, which yielded the N-terminal A-(1–19)-B-(9–16) disulfide peptide. Peptides were identified by MALDI-MS and HPLC. The fragmentation pattern is in agreement with the parallel arrangement of the two chains (see supplemental material) as observed in natural and synthetic bovine RLF (9Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Truncation at the N terminus of the A chain up to the first cysteine in position A-10 resulted in derivatives with full receptor binding properties (Fig. 2A). CD spectra (Fig. 2B) showed signal intensities similar to full-length RLF at the absolute minimum but showed a slight reduction at 222 nm. In addition, a small blue-shift of the absolute minimum and the crossover point were observed amounting to ∼0.5 nm for the Ades-(1–6) and Ades-(1–7) RLF derivatives and ∼1 nm for Ades-(1–8) and Ades-(1–9) RLF derivatives. Measurements of the cAMP-response yielded a complete dose-response curve for Ades-(1–6) RLF albeit with a reduced activity of ∼10% relative to the full-length RLF. In contrast, the activity of derivatives truncated by 7, 8, and 9 residues from the N terminus of the A chain showed significantly reduced cAMP production; none of them reached full response even at the highest concentration. This effect is more pronounced for Ades-(1–8) and Ades-(1–9) RLF than for Ades-(1–7) RLF (Fig. 2C). RLF shortened at the N terminus of the B chain by 5 residues retains full receptor binding affinity (Fig. 3A). Its CD spectrum indicates a slight increase of signal intensity and a very small red-shift (>0.5 nm) when compared with the CD spectrum of the full-length RLF (Fig. 3B). Bdes-(1–5) RLF retains the wild-type trans-membrane signal activity (Fig. 3C). The additional deletion of 6 residues from the N terminus of the A chain still does not affect receptor binding (Fig. 3A), or the secondary structure, as evidenced by the CD spectrum (Fig. 3B). However, the dose-dependent cAMP production is reduced to 10% of the RLF response (Fig. 3C). Derivatives in which either arginine in position A-8 or tyrosine in position A-9 are replaced by alanine have 100% binding avidity, an intact secondary structure, and 100% cAMP response (Fig. 4). Ades-(1–9) RLF supplemented with the missing A chain nonapeptide in equimolar amounts could not restore adenylate cyclase activity (data not shown). To evaluate the inhibitory effect we measured the RLF-dependent cAMP response in the presence of a constant concentration (2 ng/ml) of Ades-(1–8) RLF. In parallel, the inverse experiment was conducted by increasing the dose of the inhibitor Ades-(1–8) in the presence of a uniform concentration (2 ng/ml) of hRLF. The two dose-response curves crossed at a concentration of 1.5 ng/ml, indicating that Ades-(1–8) behaves as a competitive antagonist. Inhibitory efficacy is a function of the direct cAMP attenuation and binding avidity. For the Ades-(1–8) RLF derivative the ED50 is attained at a 1:1 ratio of RLF to inhibitor. Results of previous studies suggest that tryptophan B-27 (10Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and arginine B-16 2E. E. Büllesbach and C. Schwabe, unpublished results. contribute to the binding energy of RLF/receptor interaction. However, the reduction in affinity upon replacement of either amino acid by alanine is only ∼50-fold, suggesting that additional binding sites exist that contribute to the relatively high energy of the RLF/LGR8 interaction (19Sudu S. Kumagai J. Nishi S. Layfields S. Ferraro T. Bathgate R.A.D. Hsueh A.J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7855-7862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). While searching for these binding regions by measuring both receptor-binding and cAMP production, we discovered a signal initiation region of RLF apart from the receptor-binding contacts. The first target of our investigation was the N-terminal region of the A chain. The data suggest that binding to the LGR8 receptor expressed in 293T cells is not significantly perturbed by the removal of up to 9 residues from the N-terminal end of the RLF A chain. Small changes of the CD spectra imply changes in secondary structure, in particular, the blue-shift and the reduction of the 222-nm minimum suggest presence of the less stable 310-helix (20Biron Z. Khare S. Samson A.O. Hayek Y. Naider F. Anglister J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12687-12696Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) next to the α-helix (16Adler A.J. Greenfield N.J. Fasman G.D. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 675-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Increased changes are observed for derivatives truncated up to 8 residues. It is unclear how many of these changes can be contributed to the secondary structure of the removed N-terminal peptide. Residue 9 is tyrosine, which may make a structure-independent contribution to the spectrum. RLF B chain truncation experiments further enhance the impression that the molecule can be pared down substantially without affecting the core of the binding region. Extensive deletion of amino acids from both ends of the B chain does not interfere with receptor binding. Even in combination with N-terminal shortening of the A chain by 6 residues, the B chain N-terminal deletion of residues 1–5 and elimination of C-terminal residues beyond residue 27 from the B chain does not attenuate receptor binding. It appears that RLF can be shortened to 42 residues without significant reduction in receptor affinity (Fig. 3A) and without disturbance of the CD spectra. Note that removal of the N-terminal pentapeptide from the B chain compensates for the differences in the CD spectrum observed after truncation of the A chain alone (Fig. 3B). This would speak against the idea that water exclusion from the hydrophobic core is important for either binding or signaling activity. The B chain truncation would admit water to the same region that is uncovered if the A chain N-terminal tail is removed so that one can assume that removal of both the N- and C-terminal fragments would certainly admit water to the core region. Although deleting the N-terminal end of the A chain has no effect on receptor binding, it reduces cAMP production by RLF as a function of chain length. Shortening the B chain N terminus by 5 residues and converting the new C-terminal tryptophan B-27 to an amide have no effect on cAMP production. However, in combination with deletion of 6 amino acids from the A chain N terminus, the B chain deletions caused suppression of cAMP production similar to the effect of the A chain hexapeptide deletion alone. The cAMP production begins to decrease notably when 6 residues are removed from the N terminus of the A chain and goes to very low levels with the deletion of residues 7, 8, and 9. It appears that at least 5 amino acids have to precede cysteine (A-10) in the A chain to elicit the full cAMP response. The sequences of RLF from various species show His/Arg or Arg/His in positions 8 and 9, respectively, with human Arg/Tyr providing the only known exception (Ref. 21Truong A. Bogatcheva N.V. Schelling C. Dolf G. Agoulnik A.I. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 1658-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar and references therein). To investigate the specificity requirements of the signaling initiation effect we synthesized RLF with alanine in position 8 and a second one with alanine in position 9; both derivatives were fully active. The fact that alanine is sufficient to restore signal initiation activity leaves one with the novel idea that, in this case, primary structure per se may be sufficient to illicit the most important communication function in an organism. The role of the A chain tail is merely to provide bulk to maintain a certain conformation of the receptor activation complex. Furthermore, it seems that RLF truncated beyond position A-6, while retaining some background activity, cannot stimulate full activity by a large excess of the ligand. This observation suggests that the A chain-truncated molecule is a specific competitive RLF inhibitor. A potent inhibitor of RLF activity in vivo would provide an important research tool for investigating the ramifications and mechanisms of cryptorchidism. The idea was tested by measuring suppression of cAMP production by a uniform amount of truncated RLF added to each point of a human RLF dose-response curve as well as by adding a uniform amount of active RLF to a RLF inhibitor curve. The result, depicted in Fig. 5, confirms that the truncated molecule is a competitive inhibitor of cAMP production by RLF and that approximately equimolar concentrations of the inhibitor are needed to suppress the cAMP production by 50%. These experiments have led to the most surprising observation that a segment of a primary structure (as opposed to specific amino acids) is responsible for signal initiation of RLF as it binds to the LGR8 receptor. It invites the suggestion that receptor side chains must be in place to make and break contact, in the mode of a vintage telegraph.

https://openalex.org/W2136521999,"Human porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS) can exist in two dramatically different quaternary structure isoforms, which have been proposed to be in dynamic equilibrium (Breinig, S., Kervinen, J., Stith, L., Wasson, A. S., Fairman, R., Wlodawer, A., Zdanov, A., and Jaffe, E. K. (2003) Nat. Struct. Biol. 10, 757–763). The quaternary structure isoforms of PBGS result from two alternative conformations of the monomer; one monomer structure assembles into a high activity octamer, whereas the other monomer structure assembles into a low activity hexamer. The kinetic behavior of these oligomers led to the hypothesis that turnover facilitates the interconversion of the oligomeric structures. The current work demonstrates that the interactions of ligands at the enzyme active site promote the structural interconversion between human PBGS quaternary structure isoforms, favoring formation of the octamer. This observation illustrates that the assembly and disassembly of oligomeric proteins can be facilitated by the protein motions that accompany enzymatic catalysis. Human porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS) can exist in two dramatically different quaternary structure isoforms, which have been proposed to be in dynamic equilibrium (Breinig, S., Kervinen, J., Stith, L., Wasson, A. S., Fairman, R., Wlodawer, A., Zdanov, A., and Jaffe, E. K. (2003) Nat. Struct. Biol. 10, 757–763).

The current work demonstrates that the interactions of ligands at the enzyme active site promote the structural interconversion between human PBGS quaternary structure isoforms, favoring formation of the octamer. This observation illustrates that the assembly and disassembly of oligomeric proteins can be facilitated by the protein motions that accompany enzymatic catalysis. A recent description of a rare human allele of porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS) 1The abbreviations used are: PBGS, porphobilinogen synthase; 4,7-DOSA, 4,7-dioxosebacic acid; ALA, 5-aminolevulinic acid; BTP-HCl (bis-tris), 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane hydrochloride; WT, wild type. revealed that the enzyme can exist as two alternate quaternary structures wherein the oligomeric state is dictated by distinctly different structures for their component crystallographic asymmetric unit (1Breinig S. Kervinen J. Stith L. Wasson A.S. Fairman R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Jaffe E.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The monomer is an αβ-barrel protein with a 23-residue N-terminal arm. The octameric form is comprised of four “hugging dimers” (Fig. 1a), whereas the hexameric form is comprised of three “detached dimers” (Fig. 1b). In both oligomeric assemblies there are invariant barrel-to-barrel subunit interactions within the dimers and quasiequivalent arm-to-bottom-of-barrel subunit interactions between adjacent dimers (Fig. 1). However, the octamer has a unique “hugging” arm-to-barrel interaction that is not seen in the hexamer. Preparations of heterologously expressed wild type human PBGS predominantly contain octamer, but there is a small propensity to adopt the hexameric structure (1Breinig S. Kervinen J. Stith L. Wasson A.S. Fairman R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Jaffe E.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast, heterologous expression of the rare human variant, F12L, yields protein that purifies as the hexamer and does not readily take on the octameric structure. The homo-octameric wild type and homohexameric F12L forms of human PBGS exhibit dramatic differences in pH activity profile and in the kinetic Km values (Table I) (1Breinig S. Kervinen J. Stith L. Wasson A.S. Fairman R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Jaffe E.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) despite the fact that amino acid residue 12 does not interact directly with active site residues in either quaternary structure isoform (Fig. 1). However, the arm-to-barrel interface found in the hugging dimer provides substantial stabilization for the solvent-accessible face of the αβ-barrel wherein lies the active site. This region of the protein, which is disordered in the hexamer, includes an ∼11-amino acid stretch that normally serves to gate the active site from solvent, also called the active site lid. With the active site more solvent-accessible in the hexamer, a high external pH is required to drive the Schiff base formation that is necessary for catalysis (2Jaffe E.K. Bioorg. Chem. 2004; 32: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); this contributes to the high pH required for F12L activity. The decreased affinity of F12L for substrate is attributed to the loss of interactions between the destabilized active site lid and the carboxyl moiety of the outermost substrate (3Kervinen J.

Open table in a new tab Coexpression of wild type and F12L (WT+F12L) yielded a mixture of hetero-octamers and heterohexamers, each of which contained some Phe12 and some Leu12 (1Breinig S. Kervinen J. Stith L. Wasson A.S. Fairman R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Jaffe E.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The characterization of these heterohexamers and hetero-octamers of WT+F12L demonstrated that the quaternary structure, and not the specific amino acid mutation, was responsible for the differences in Km values and pH activity profiles (1Breinig S. Kervinen J. Stith L. Wasson A.S. Fairman R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Jaffe E.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 2Jaffe E.K. Bioorg. Chem. 2004; 32: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The coexpressed hetero-oligomers of WT+F12L could be separated by ion exchange chromatography and/or by native gel electrophoresis. The mobilities of wild type and F12L are used, respectively, as standards for octameric and hexameric hetero-oligomers. According to these analytical tools, the hetero-oligomers are stable structures that repeatedly chromatograph/electrophorese true. However, determination of Km and Vmax values for the hetero-oligomers fit best to a model (Equation 1) wherein catalysis is by an equilibrium of the octameric (low Km or Km1) and hexameric (high Km or Km2) forms of the hetero-oligomers (Table I). In fact, studies with wild type human PBGS at non-physiologic conditions (pH 9) also fit best to catalysis by a dynamic equilibrium of low Km (octameric) and high Km (hexameric) forms. velocity=Vmax1[S]Km1+[S]+Vmax2[S]Km2+[S]Equation 1 Although the thermodynamic foundation for the preference of wild type human PBGS and F12L to assemble into octamer and hexamer, respectively, remains unclear, the current study capitalizes on this differential preference to evaluate factors that effect the interconversion of quaternary structure isoforms of WT+F12L. The current work substantiates the hypothesis that the hetero-oligomers of human PBGS can interconvert, as shown in Fig. 2, upon addition of substrate. This is the first time such a dynamic structural rearrangement has been demonstrated. The current work exploits the different kinetic, chromatographic, and electrophoretic properties of the hexamers and octamers and utilizes dynamic light scattering to determine the factors that catalyze the interconversion of PBGS quaternary structure isoforms. PBGS from any organism has not been observed in a form smaller than the dimer. Thus heteromeric WT+F12L proteins are believed to be made up of stable dimers of three compositions (which are at position 12): Phe+Phe, Phe+Leu, and Leu+Leu. As some heterologously expressed human PBGS partitions to inclusion bodies, one cannot assume that the ratio of these dimers is 1:2:1 in the soluble isolated protein. However, because the homomeric Phe12-containing protein folds and assembles preferentially as the octamer and the homomeric Leu12-containing protein folds and assembles exclusively as the hexamer, one can propose that Phe+Phe dimers will preferentially assemble to the octamer and that Leu+Leu dimers will preferentially assemble to the hexamer. This is qualitatively consistent with the observed Phe:Leu ratio of the hetero-oligomers reported previously (1Breinig S. Kervinen J. Stith L. Wasson A.S. Fairman R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Jaffe E.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and confirmed herein. Following this rationale, one can also propose that a dynamic reequilibration of heteromeric oligomers (Fig. 2) would result in a disproportionation reaction that favors accumulation of Phe12 in the octamer and Leu12 in the hexamer. The reported results substantiate this hypothesis. Genes and Constructs—The human PBGS N59/C162A is used as WT in this study (4Jaffe E.K. Martins J. Li J. Kervinen J. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The F12L variant was constructed as previously reported (1Breinig S. Kervinen J. Stith L. Wasson A.S. Fairman R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Jaffe E.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The plasmid (pET17bWTF12L) containing one promoter has been reported previously (1Breinig S. Kervinen J. Stith L. Wasson A.S. Fairman R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Jaffe E.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The plasmid with two promoters (pET17b*WTF12L) was constructed as follows. The pET17b* vector was modified from pET17b. A point mutation at position 3249 (T → G) introduced a BclI restriction site. The plasmids pET3aWT and pET17b* were digested with BamHI and NdeI. The resulting fragments were ligated and transformed into Epicurian Coli® SCS110 cells to prepare pET17b*WT. Plasmid DNA containing the F12L gene (pET3aF12L) was digested with BglII and SspI. The gene for F12L and the linearized pET17b*WT (using BclI and SspI) were ligated such that F12L is downstream from WT, and each WT and F12L gene has its own T7 promoter and terminator. The resulting plasmid, pET17b*WTF12L, was transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue cells, and plasmid DNA was prepared. Protein Expression and Purification—The plasmid pET17b*WTF12L was transformed into E. coli BLR(DE3) for protein expression. The protein was purified from the soluble fraction of the lysed cells using 20–45% ammonium sulfate fractionation, hydrophobic chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose, anion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-BioGel or Q-Sepharose, and gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 as described previously (1Breinig S. Kervinen J. Stith L. Wasson A.S. Fairman R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Jaffe E.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 4Jaffe E.K. Martins J. Li J. Kervinen J. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Samples of heteromeric WT+F12L were derived from several different purifications from either the one-promoter or the two-promoter construct and consequently varied in their Phe12:Leu12 ratios. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. PBGS Activity Determination—The enzyme activity assay was based on the measurement of the porphobilinogen formed from 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) by PBGS. Assay buffer was 0.1 m 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane hydrochloride (bis-tris) (BTP-HCl) at desired pH values, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm ZnCl2. The reported pH values reflect the assay pH after the addition of ALA-HCl to a final concentration of 10 mm. Enzyme was preincubated in assay buffer at 37 °C for 10 min before the addition of ALA-HCl. In fixed time assays, the total volume of the assay mixture was 1 ml; the reaction proceeded for a fixed time before the addition of 0.5 ml of STOP reagent (20% trichloroacetic acid, 0.1 m HgCl2) to terminate the reaction. In the time course activity assay at t = 0, ALA-HCl was added to a bulk assay volume (30 ml), and 1 ml of assay mixture was withdrawn at desired time points into a tube containing 0.5 ml of STOP reagent. The stopped assay solutions were vortexed vigorously and then centrifuged for 3 min to remove the precipitated protein and 2-mercaptoethanol. A pink-colored complex was formed by mixing 0.8 ml of assay solution with 0.8 ml of Ehrlich's reagent. The color was allowed to fully develop for 8 min before the determination of absorbance at 555 nm (ϵ555 = 60,200 m–1 cm–1) (5Jordan P.M. Gibbs P.N. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Equilibrium Dialysis Experiments—The dialysis buffer was 0.1 m BTP-HCl at desired pH values, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 μm ZnCl2. The reported pH values reflect the dialysis buffer pH after the addition of ALA (where included). Protein solutions (∼200 μl at 3–7 mg/ml) were dialyzed in the presence or absence of ALA against 300 ml of buffer at 37 °C for 24 h or longer under gentle agitation (50–60 rpm) in an air shaker. Samples of the buffer were periodically withdrawn for determination of porphobilinogen concentration using Ehrlich's reagent (see above). Samples were also taken from the dialysis cassette at desired time points for native gel electrophoresis. Gels were then scanned, and the fractional intensity of the protein bands at each time point was analyzed using SigmaGel™ gel analysis software (Jandel Corp.). Native Gel Electrophoresis—Native gel electrophoresis was done on a PhastGel system (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were prepared by mixing the protein solution with native gel running buffer (0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, 20% glycerol, 0.0025% bromphenol blue) to reach a final protein concentration of ∼1 mg/ml. Four microliters of each sample solution was loaded on a homogeneous 12.5% polyacrylamide gel (Amersham Biosciences, 12.5% total acrylamide in separation zone; buffer, 0.112 m acetate, 0.112 m Tris, pH 6.5). The gels were run with PhastGel native buffer strips (Amersham Biosciences, 0.88 m l-alanine, 0.25 m Tris, pH 8.8, made of 3% Agarose IEF). After separation, gels were developed on the PhastGel system using Coomassie staining. Light-scattering Measurements—The molecular weight change during substrate-induced dynamic interconversion was monitored using a temperature-controlled DynoPro dynamic light-scattering instrument (Protein Solutions Inc.) at 37 °C. Protein (∼1 mg/ml) was preincubated in assay buffer at 37 °C for 10 min. Immediately after the addition of ALA to a final concentration of 10 mm, the solution mixture was filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane into a 37 °C prewarmed light-scattering cuvette. The cuvette was kept at 37 °C in an incubator during the experiment except the times at which the light-scattering measurements were taken. The average molecular weight calculated was based on the measurement of KC/R90 (6van Holde K.E. Johnson C. Ho P.S. Principles of Physical Biochemistry. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1998: 312-340Google Scholar). The calculated molecular weights are lower than that expected for octamer and hexamer presumably due to the presence of a small concentration of the dimers. Mass Spectral Analysis of the Disproportionation of Heteromeric Oligomers—WT+F12L Pool I and Pool II protein solutions underwent 24 h of equilibrium dialysis in the presence of 10 mm ALA. The hexameric and octameric forms of the protein were separated after the dialysis using a 1-ml Mono-Q column. The Mono-Q buffer was 30 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μl ZnCl2. The hexameric and octameric forms were separated using a 0.02–1.0 m KCl gradient in 27 column volumes. Fractions containing hexameric and octameric forms were pooled and concentrated to a final concentration of ∼1 mg/ml. The concentrated pools were dialyzed against 300 ml of 2 mm BTP-HCl buffer at pH 7.0 for 3 h to remove the phosphate from the Mono-Q buffer. Samples were subject to overnight trypsin (Promega, sequencing grade modified) digestion using a 1:20 (w/w) trypsin:protein ratio. The tryptic peptide mixtures were spotted on a gold plate with cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix on top of that. The mass spectral data were collected using Reflex IV matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Inc.). Quaternary Structure Equilibration in the Presence of Irreversible Inhibitors—Enzyme (∼3 mg/ml) was preincubated at 37 °C in normal assay buffer for 10 min prior to the addition of inhibitors, succinylacetone or 4,7-dioxosebacic acid (4,7-DOSA) and levulinic acid to final concentrations of 1, 0.1, and 10 mm, respectively. The reactions proceeded at 37 °C. Protein samples were taken at desired time points for native gel electrophoresis analysis. Preparation of Heteromeric Oligomers of WT+F12L—Wild type human PBGS and the F12L variant were coexpressed from the same plasmid with a T7 promoter upstream of each gene. The coexpressed protein WT+F12L separates into two distinct pools of PBGS activity on either DEAE or Q-Sepharose anion-exchange columns. The pools were further purified on an S-300 column (1Breinig S. Kervinen J. Stith L. Wasson A.S. Fairman R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Jaffe E.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The Q-Sepharose (or DEAE) pool that elutes at lower ionic strength is called Pool I and is comprised of heterohexamers. In the current preparation heterohexamers were made up of 31% Phe12 and 69% Leu12. The pool that elutes at higher ionic strength is called Pool II and is comprised of hetero-octamers. In the current preparation hetero-octamers were made up of 67% Phe12 and 33% Leu12. Earlier preparations in which wild type human PBGS and F12L were coexpressed under one promoter just upstream of the wild type gene showed that Pool I contained 49% Phe12 and 51% Leu12, whereas Pool II contained 71% Phe12 and 29% Leu12 (1Breinig S. Kervinen J. Stith L. Wasson A.S. Fairman R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Jaffe E.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The dependence of the distribution of Phe12 and Leu12 on the structure of the expression plasmid is unclear because the current work shows that disproportionation between quaternary isoforms will occur during expression and accumulation as long as substrate is present in the cell. Interconversion and Reequilibration of WT+F12L Heteromeric Oligomers as Monitored by Equilibrium Dialysis—Using heteromeric Pool I and Pool II, equilibrium dialysis was used to provide a physical demonstration that substrate can promote the reequilibration between octamer and hexamer according to the reaction illustrated in Fig. 2. The proteins comprised of Pool I and Pool II were separately dialyzed at 37 °C in the presence and absence of the substrate, ALA, and the quaternary structure was probed by native gel electrophoresis as a function of dialysis time. Product formation was monitored in the dialysate and indicated that catalysis was ongoing throughout the dialysis procedure (Fig. 3a). The electrophoretic results (Fig. 3b) show that the oligomeric structures are stable for at least 46 h when dialysis is carried out in the absence of substrate. However, the presence of the substrate causes a dramatic reequilibration of quaternary structure isoforms, favoring accumulation of the octamer in all cases (Pool I and Pool II at pH 7.0 and pH 9.0). These pH values correspond to the optimal pH for the activity of the octamer and the hexamer, respectively (1Breinig S. Kervinen J. Stith L. Wasson A.S. Fairman R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Jaffe E.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Densitometry was used to estimate the rate and extent of the reequilibration reaction for Pool I at pH 7 and pH 9 and for Pool II at pH 9 (Fig. 3c) where the data were fitted to an exponential function and fit to rate constants of 0.54 h-1 (Pool I, pH 7), 0.4 h–1 (Pool I, pH 9), and 1.8 h–1 (Pool II, pH 7), respectively. The rate and extent of conversion of Pool I to octamer was greater at pH 7 than at pH 9, suggesting that there is a pH dependence to the equilibrium between the PBGS quaternary structure isoforms. This is consistent with data on wild type human PBGS (octamer) where kinetic evidence indicates catalysis by both octamer and hexamer at pH 9 but catalysis only by octamer at pH 7 (1Breinig S. Kervinen J. Stith L. Wasson A.S. Fairman R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Jaffe E.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Analysis of Pool I and Pool II Oligomers following the Substrate-induced Interconversion of Quaternary Isoforms—Using freshly prepared hetero-oligomers of WT+F12L, the Pool I and Pool II proteins were separated chromatographically and then dialyzed for 24 h at pH 7 in the presence of 10 mm ALA. Following dialysis, the reequilibrated hetero-oligomers were again separated into their hexameric and octameric components by chromatography on a Mono-Q column. The separated proteins were characterized for their specific activity and for their Phe12 and Leu12 content. The specific activities of hexamer and octamer are dramatically different with hexamer showing optimal activity at pH 9, and the activity of octamer is maximal at pH 7 (Table II) (1Breinig S. Kervinen J. Stith L. Wasson A.S. Fairman R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Jaffe E.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A native gel of these proteins shows the relative distribution of octamer and hexamer in samples before dialysis and after Mono-Q chromatography (Fig. 4a). Following chromatographic separation, the proteins were called Pool I hexamer, Pool I octamer, Pool II hexamer, and Pool II octamer and are described below. The peak to elute first on the Mono-Q column runs comparably to the F12L mutant, which is the hexamer. The hexameric structure is substantiated by native gel electrophoresis and by specific activity at pH 7 and pH 9 (Fig. 4a and Table II). The second peak to elute runs comparably to the WT human PBGS, which is the octamer. The octameric structure is substantiated by native gel electrophoresis and specific activity at pH 7 and pH 9 (Fig. 4a and Table II). Consistent with the documented characteristics of human PBGS hexamers and octamers (1Breinig S. Kervinen J. Stith L. Wasson A.S. Fairman R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Jaffe E.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), Pool I hexamer and Pool II hexamer have very low activity at pH 7 and considerable activity at pH 9. Pool I octamer and Pool II octamer both show substantially higher activity at pH 7 than at pH 9.Table IISpecific activities (μmol h-1 mg-1) of hexameric and octameric forms of human PBGS before and after substrate-induced disproportionationF12LWTWT+F12L Pool IWT+F12L Pool IIPool I hexamerPool I octomerPool II hexamerPool II octamerpH 70.356.97.921.80.511.50.217.6pH 914.513.16.65.45.86.81.65.7 Open table in a new tab To address the hypothesis that hetero-oligomeric WT+F12L pools will disproportionate, resulting in accumulation of Phe12 in the octamer and Leu12 in the hexamer, the Phe12 and Leu12 content of the heteromeric PBGS oligomers was determined before dialysis and after Mono-Q chromatography. The proteins were subjected to tryptic digestion, and the N-terminal peptide was analyzed by laser desorption mass spectroscopy. Prior work had established that this technique gives quantitative results that are comparable to those obtained by quantitative N-terminal sequencing for these two very similar peptides (1Breinig S. Kervinen J. Stith L. Wasson A.S. Fairman R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Jaffe E.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The masses of the N-terminal tryptic peptides are 2010.2 Da for the Phe12-containing peptide and 1976.2 Da for the Leu12-containing peptide (Fig. 4b). The data confirm that both Pool I and Pool II contain heteromeric species. The Pool I protein, initially a heterohexamer at a Phe:Leu ratio of 32:68, when dialyzed against ALA, yields the Pool I hexamer and a Pool I octamer of respective ratios 13:86 and 51:49. This demonstrates a dramatic disproportionation of the Leu-containing species to the hexamer and the Phe-containing species to the octamer. The dramatic change in the Phe:Leu ratio was also observed when the Pool II protein, initially at 67:32, was dialyzed against ALA. On a native gel, Pool II shows a major octamer band and a light hexamer band (Fig. 4a). After 24 h of dialysis in the presence of ALA, the Pool II octamer was enriched in Phe (Phe:Leu ratio of 81:19), and the small amount of remaining hexamer was enriched in Leu (Phe:Leu ratio of 14:86). The mass spectral data unequivocally establishes the disproportionation of heteromeric PBGS isoforms under turnover conditions. The mass spectral data also confirm that human PBGS with phenylalanine at position 12 prefers the octamer, which assembles from the hugging dimer, and protein with leucine at position 12 prefers the hexamer, which assembles from the detached dimer. It remains unclear whether the dynamic structural interconversion illustrated in Fig. 2 is further complicated by the dissociation of dimers into their component monomers. Such a reequilibration of dimers could result in the disproportionation of a population of Phe+Leu dimers into Phe+Phe and Leu+Leu dimers. Dynamic Interconversion of WT+F12L Hetero-oligomeric PBGS Quaternary Structure Isoforms Is Accompanied by an Increase in Activity at pH 7—Prior kinetic studies of PBGS showed that the dependence of activity on substrate concentration does not follow a simple hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten relationship (Table I). The kinetic data are best fit using a double hyperbolic equation (Equation 1), which is applicable to a model in which two enzymes of different kinetic parameters are catalyzing the same reaction (7Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics—Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 64-71Google Scholar). The substrate-induced structural interconversion (Figs. 3 and 4) and the resulting specific activity changes (Table II) suggest that the heteromeric WT+F12L pools undergo structural rearrangement under assay conditions. Since substrate-induced interconversion favors the octamer, which has increased activity at pH 7 relative to the hexamer, then the time course of product formation should show an increase in rate with time. This change is proposed to be most dramatic for Pool I (the heterologously expressed heterohexamer of WT+F12L) at pH 7 where the difference between the activities of octamer and hexamer is the greatest. As predicted, the specific activity of WT+F12L Pool I protein increases with time (Fig. 5a). The rate constant (1.05 h–1) is based on fitting the data to an exponential rate equation and is about twice as fast as that determined from the equilibrium dialysis experiment (0.54 h–1), qualitatively consistent with an expected delay caused by the time required for substrate and product to cross the dialysis membrane. Similar behavior was observed for WT+F12L Pool II where the rate constant is 7.9 h–1 (Fig. 5b). Structural Interconversion Monitored by Light-scattering Measurements—Structural interconversion between hexamer and octamer not only has an effect on the activity of the protein; it also alters the average molecular weight of protein. Using dynamic light scattering, the molecular weight change during the structural rearrangement of Pools I and II in the presence of substrate was monitored (Fig. 5). The light-scattering data yield rate constants that are comparable to the rate constants from the time course activity assay (1.0 h–1 for Pool I at pH 7 and 5.0 h–1 for Pool II), thus supporting the conclusion that the increase in activity is due to the interconversion of hexamer to octamer in the presence of substrate. Turnover Is Not Required for the Structural Interconversion of PBGS Quaternary Structure Isoforms—The studies presented above demonstrate that turnover promotes the formation of octameric PBGS fro"

The N-linked oligosaccharide is processed by ER glycosidases, resulting in high mannose-type intermediates that participate in folding of the glycoprotein (1Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar, 2Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8623-8626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Subsequent export to the Golgi apparatus allows additional modifications, forming complex-type structures, that can participate in the function of the glycoprotein. The congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are inherited disorders in which the synthesis of LLO (Type I) or the processing of the N-linked oligosaccharide (Type II) is defective. Twelve Type I subtypes (Ia–Il) are known (3Frank C.G. Grubenmann C.E. Eyaid W. Berger E.G. Aebi M. Hennet T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 75: 146-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In all cases of CDG-I, serum glycoproteins of hepatic origin (transferrin is typically used for clinical evaluation) are underglycosylated. Depending upon the CDG-I subtype, this hypoglycosylation can be due to either inadequate production of mature LLO (limiting the amount of donor substrate for the oligosaccharyltransferase (OT), which transfers oligosaccharide to protein) or production of structurally immature LLOs that are poor donor substrates for OT (4Marquardt T. Freeze H. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 5Jaeken J. Matthijs G. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2001; 2: 129-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and can be caused by defects in mannose metabolism or the LLO assembly pathway. CDG-Ia patients typically show symptoms by six months of age, including developmental and neurological abnormalities. The root cause of CDG-Ia (which accounts for most Type I cases) is a genetic deficiency of phosphomannomutase (PMM), encoded by the PMM2 gene, resulting in a diminished capacity to convert mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) to mannose 1-phosphate (M1P) (4Marquardt T. Freeze H. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 5Jaeken J. Matthijs G. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2001; 2: 129-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). PMM deficiency would thus be expected to hinder formation of M1P and its metabolite, GDP-mannose (GDP-M), as reported (6Körner C. Lehle L. von Figura K. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7Rush J.S. Panneerselvam K. Waechter C.J. Freeze H.H. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Reduced concentrations of GDP-M, which contributes mannosyl residues (directly or via dolichol-P-mannose) to LLOs, would be predicted to inhibit maturation of the oligosaccharide.

Deficient conversion of dehydrodolichol (polyprenol) to dolichol has also been reported in CDG-Ia fibroblasts and may contribute to LLO biosynthetic defects (12Ohkura T. Fukushima K. Kurisaki A.

Thus, the CDG-Ia phenotype has been explained by an inadequate supply of mature LLO coupled with over-abundance of immature LLOs that are poor OT substrates. The second CDG-I subtype reported, Ib, is caused by a genetic deficiency of phosphomannose isomerase (PMI), with hindered formation of M6P from fructose 6-phosphate (F6P). Differing from CDG-Ia, CDG-Ib cells have mainly mature LLOs, although apparently in limited amounts (7Rush J.S. Panneerselvam K. Waechter C.J. Freeze H.H. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Niehues R. Hasilik M. Alton G. Körner C. Schiebe-Sukumar M. Koch H.G. Zimmer K.P. Wu R. Harms E. Reiter K. von Figura K.

The third form of CDG-I identified, Type Ic, is due to a defect in the specific glycosyltransferase that adds glucose to M9Gn2-P-P-Dol. In CDG-Ic, hypoglycosylation presumably occurs because the accumulated M9Gn2-P-P-Dol is a poor substrate for OT (14Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R.

Supporting the idea that PMM2 defects in CDG-Ia cause defective LLO synthesis, analyses of total [3H]mannose-labeled glycoprotein pools from cultured CDG-Ia fibroblasts have indicated hypoglycosylation (6Körner C.

We noticed that reports of LLO abnormalities and hypoglycosylation in CDG-Ia fibroblasts were always associated with [3H]mannose pulse labeling of LLOs and glycoproteins (6Körner C.

These studies were done with culture media containing low glucose concentrations, typically 0–0.5 mm, below the physiological minimum of 4–5 mm. Such media are frequently used to increase labeling of cellular glycoconjugates with sugar precursors such as [3H]mannose and [3H]glucosamine and have long been considered suitable for labeling LLOs, since they can be used to detect synthesis of mature LLOs in normal human fibroblasts and cell lines such as CHO-K1. Analyses of CDG-Ia LLOs in physiological glucose have not been reported, because the efficiency of [3H]mannose labeling is so low. In contrast, experiments that reported normal glycosylation of specific glycoproteins used antibody-based methods and CDG-Ia fibroblasts cultured in media with physiological glucose (16Marquardt T. Ullrich K. Zimmer P. Hasilik A. Deufel T. Harms E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 268-273PubMed Google Scholar, 17Marquardt T. Ullrich K. Niehues R. Koch H-G. Harms E. J.

Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 1277-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This discrepancy might be explained if LLO synthesis in CDG-Ia fibroblasts was not seriously defective in physiological glucose. If so, the basis for the glycosylation deficiency in patients would require reevaluation. To address these points, we used a nonradioactive method, fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE), to quantitatively analyze steady-state CDG-Ia LLO pools with media containing subphysiological and physiological concentrations of glucose (19Gao N. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Gao N. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 1G-3GCrossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our FACE results demonstrated abundant Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol, without hypoglycosylation, in CDG-Ia fibroblasts grown with physiological glucose and led us to identify a novel effect of M6P in vitro that might explain hypoglycosylation of proteins synthesized by CDG-Ia patients' hepatocytes. Cell Cultures and Media—All cells were grown in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. When needed, low glucose media were prepared either by mixing complete and glucose-free formulations (see Fig. 2 and Table III) or by adding glucose to glucose-free media (Fig. 4). Normal and CDG-I dermal fibroblasts were obtained from the sources listed in Table I and were grown with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) in either RPMI 1640 medium (11 mm glucose) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (5 mm glucose) (Invitrogen) as described (21Shang J. Körner C. Freeze H. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells and related mutant lines were grown in Ham's F-12 medium with 2% fetal bovine serum and 8% calf serum. Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes (kindly provided by Dr. Guoxun Chen, Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Texas-Southwestern) were cultured in medium 199 with 10% fetal bovine serum on collagen-coated plates.Table IIIG3M9Gn2-P-P-Dol and M5Gn2-P-P-Dol contents as functions of glucose concentrationCell type2.5 mm glucose10 mm glucosenM5Gn2G3M9Gn2M5Gn2/G3M9Gn2M5Gn2G3M9Gn2M5Gn2/G3M9Gn2nmol/mg cellular proteinnmol/mg cellular proteinNormal3.0 ± 0.12.8 ± 0.31.11.1 ± 0.26.9 ± 0.60.168CDG-Ia2.2 ± 0.30.7 ± 0.13.11.5 ± 0.27.3 ± 0.50.216 Open table in a new tab Fig. 4Assessment of selectivity for mature LLO by oligosaccharyltransferases in intact normal and CDG-Ia fibroblasts.

In some cases, 10, 30, 100, 300, or 1000 μm unlabeled mannose were added. [3H]LLO glycans released from LLOs with mild acid, and 3H-labeled N-glycans released from protein with N-glycosidase F (Calbiochem), were analyzed by HPLC (22Shang J. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol.

Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The buffer was removed, and cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then harvested into methanol. The suspension was transferred to a 10-ml glass tube and dried under N2(g). LLO [3H]glycans were recovered, detected by HPLC (23Anand M. Rush J.S. Ray S. Doucey M.A. Weik J. Ware F.E. Hofsteenge J.

After removal of reaction buffer, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and harvested into methanol. After drying under N2(g), sequential extractions were performed with chloroform/methanol (2:1) (discarded), with water (free glycans), and with chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3) (LLOs). Free glycans were deionized with AG50-X8 and AG1-X8 resins. LLOs were cleaved with weak acid, and LLO glycans were recovered (19Gao N.

The water extract was deionized with AG50-X8 and AG1-X8 to remove residual salt and GDP-[3H]mannose. Molecules with exposed reducing termini were modified with ANTS (19Gao N. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and removed with a second AG1-X8 treatment. After drying, the glycopeptides were dissolved with 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 0.1 units of endoglycosidase H and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Deionization with AG50-X8 and AG1-X8 was repeated. Endoglycosidase H-released glycans were modified with ANDS and analyzed in one of three ways: (i) a portion was counted directly to assess total [3H]glycan transferred from LLO to glycopeptide; (ii) a portion was treated with AG1-X8, and the bound (ANDS-modified) and unbound materials were counted to measure endoglycosidase H-sensitive and -resistant glycopeptide, respectively; or (iii) a portion was mixed with standards (endoglycosidase H-digested liver LLO glycans labeled with ANDS) and resolved by FACE (19Gao N. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), in which case bands containing individual glycans were cut from the gel, eluted with 1 ml of water, and counted. [3H]LLO glycans in the chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3) fraction were analyzed with FACE gels in the manner described above for glycopeptides. CDG-Ia Fibroblasts in Conventional Media Synthesize G3M9Gn2-P-P-Dol Efficiently—LLOs in four normal, five CDG-Ia, a CDG-Ib, and a CDG-Ic culture (Table I) were analyzed quantitatively by FACE after growth in conventional media. In Fig. 1, cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11 mm glucose and 10% undialyzed FBS. CDG-Ic cells accumulate M9Gn2-P-P-Dol by the [3H]mannose labeling technique (25Körner C. Knauer R. Holzbach U. Hanefeld F. Lehle L. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13200-13205Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). They gave a similar result with FACE (Fig. 1A) with mainly M9Gn2-P-P-Dol and smaller quantities of G3M9Gn2-P-P-Dol due to leakiness of the mutation. Also, as expected from [3H]mannose labeling, CDG-Ib (PMI-deficient) fibroblast LLOs were mainly G3M9Gn2-P-P-Dol (Fig. 1A). Prior studies suggested that CDG-Ib fibroblasts contain abnormally low amounts of G3M9Gn2-P-P-Dol (7Rush J.S. Panneerselvam K. Waechter C.J. Freeze H.H. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Niehues R. Hasilik M. Alton G. Körner C. Schiebe-Sukumar M. Koch H.G. Zimmer K.P. Wu R. Harms E. Reiter K. von Figura K.

By FACE, the amounts of G3M9Gn2-P-P-Dol detected in CDG-Ib fibroblasts were highly variable, from 100% (in Fig. 1A) to 20% of normal (data not shown). The basis for this variability was not determined, although the PMI activity was also quite variable (Supplemental Fig. 1). Thus, it was anticipated that CDG-Ia (PMM-deficient) LLO glycans analyzed by FACE would be mainly immature structures such as M2–5Gn2. However, with multiple independent cultures, LLO glycans from CDG-Ia fibroblast cultures grown with conventional RPMI 1640 were mainly G3M9Gn2 and were indistinguishable from normal (Fig. 1, A and B). This was verified by quantitative FACE analysis for duplicate cultures of three normal and four CDG-Ia fibroblasts (Table II). Due to this unanticipated result, we verified that our CDG-Ia fibroblasts were authentic, having expected decreases of PMM activity (26Grünewald S. Schollen E. Van Schaftingen E. Jaeken J.

The contact site formed during this recognition process has been termed the supramolecular activation complex or the immunological synapse (IS) (1Grakoui A. Bromley S.K. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Science. 1999; 285: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar). This engagement initiates a series of intracellular biochemical events that result in biological responses, such as T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation. One of the earliest events after T cell ligation is the activation of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs), including members of the Src (Lck and Fyn) and Syk (ZAP-70 and Syk) families. Once activated, these PTKs can phosphorylate many downstream substrates on tyrosine and induce the formation of multisubunit signaling complexes and signaling cascades that ultimately lead to the activation of transcription factors and cytokine production. This de novo gene expression mediates differentiation of the cells into effector cells capable of mediating adaptive immune responses (2Glimcher L.H. Singh H. Cell. 1999; 96: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 3Lin J. Weiss A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 243-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One critical mediator of TCR signaling is the Vav family of guanine exchange factors for the Rho family of small GTPases. Vav proteins represent a key link between antigen receptor-coupled PTKs and signaling pathways controlled by these small GTPases (4Altman A. Deckert M. Adv.

Immunol. Rev. 2003; 192: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Following the discovery and characterization of the first member, Vav1 (7Katzav S. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), two other mammalian members, Vav2 and Vav3, were identified (8Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Nielsen D.A. Song B.J. Barbacid M. Goldman D. Lee I.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 363-371PubMed Google Scholar, 9Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Whereas Vav1 is expressed primarily in cells of the hematopoietic lineage, Vav2 and Vav3 display a much broader expression profile (10Turner M. Billadeau D.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). One major characteristic of Vav proteins is their rapid tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by PTKs of the Src and/or Syk families upon engagement of several receptors, including the B cell receptor and TCR (11Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). This process liberates the catalytic Dbl homology domain and causes Vav to promote GDP-GTP exchange on its small GTPase targets (12Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Another specific structural feature of mammalian Vav proteins is the presence of adapter domains, SH3-SH2-SH3, in their C-terminal region. In T cells, these domains allow Vav proteins to associate with PTKs of the Syk family (13Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A.

The SH2 domain of Vav2 also seems to be essential for its membrane targeting following epidermal growth factor receptor stimulation in COS7 cells (22Tamas P. Solti Z. Buday L. Cell.

In T cells, Vav proteins transcriptionally regulate IL-2 promoter activity by acting on several transcription factors, including nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) (13Deckert M.

Interestingly, Vav1 synergizes with SLP-76 to increase both TCR-induced NFAT and IL-2 promoter activation (14Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A.

Med. 1996; 184: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, a physical Vav1/SLP-76 interaction seems to be dispensable, since SLP-76 mutants incapable of binding Vav1 can still synergize with the latter (28Fang N. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16206-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Despite the high degree of homology among the three mammalian Vav family members, their effects on NFAT or NF-κB can differ according to the cell type. For example, Vav2 activates NFAT in B cells but not in T cells (29Doody G.M. Billadeau D.D. Clayton E. Hutchings A. Berland R. McAdam S. Leibson P.J. Turner M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6173-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, in T cells, only Vav1 activates NFAT, whereas both Vav1 and Vav3, but not Vav2, can enhance NF-κB-dependent transcription (30Moores S.L. Selfors L.M. Fredericks J. Breit T. Fujikawa K. Alt F.W. Brugge J.S. Swat W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The role of Vav3 in T cells has recently been highlighted by analysis of gene knock-out mice lacking one, two, or all three Vav genes. Vav1-/-vav2-/-vav3-/- triple knock-out mice show a profound block in thymocyte development and deficiency in functionally mature T and B cells, calcium mobilization, and TCR-induced or B cell receptor-induced signaling. On the other hand, vav2-/-vav3-/- double knock-out thymocytes and mature T lymphocytes exhibited normal development and activation, implicating Vav2 and Vav3 as Vav1-auxiliary proteins (31Fujikawa K. Miletic A.V. Alt F.W. Faccio R. Brown T. Hoog J. Fredericks J. Nishi S. Mildiner S. Moores S.L. Brugge J. Rosen F.S. Swat W. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1595-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Additional studies in Jurkat T cells using a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) interference gene silencing approach suggested that Vav3 participates in TCR signaling by promoting serum response element-mediated gene transcription but is not required for NFAT, NF-κB, activator protein-1, and IL-2 promoter activation (16Zakaria S. Gomez T.S. Savoy D.N. McAdam S. Turner M. Abraham R.T. Billadeau D.D. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Finally, in B cells, Vav3 recruitment into membrane lipid rafts depends on the adapters BLNK and Grb2 (32Johmura S. Oh-hora M. Inabe K. Nishikawa Y. Hayashi K. Vigorito E. Kitamura D. Turner M. Shingu K. Hikida M. Kurosaki T. Immunity. 2003; 18: 777-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and Vav3 regulates phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation upon B cell receptor stimulation (33Inabe K. Ishiai M. Scharenberg A.M. Freshney N. Downward J. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that Vav3 translocates to the plasma membrane and is recruited into the IS upon TCR triggering independently of its phosphorylation on Tyr173. However, Vav3 membrane translocation and IS targeting depend on its TCR-inducible association with SLP-76. Consistently, Vav3 mutants with a disabled SH2 domain (R697L) or lacking their three SH domains were incapable of interacting with SLP-76 and, thus, could not undergo membrane and IS translocation or mediate NFAT activation. Moreover, the Vav3-SLP-76 complex was disrupted in Jurkat T cell lines deficient in either Lck, ZAP-70, LAT, or SLP-76, where the membrane recruitment of Vav3 was abrogated. Finally, shRNA-mediated knock-down of Vav3 expression further inhibited the residual TCR/CD28-induced NFAT activation in Vav1-deficient T cells. Together, our results strongly support a dependence of Vav3 on SLP-76 for its membrane and IS recruitment and ability to mediate gene transcription upon T cell activation. Cell Culture and Transfection—Wild-type (clone JE6.1) and Lck-deficient (JCam1.6) Jurkat T cells were obtained from the ATCC and were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm minimal essential medium nonessential amino acid solution (Invitrogen), and 100 units/ml each penicillin G and streptomycin.

Welsh J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and subcloned in frame with the c-Myc tag in the pEF4 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using the restriction sites EcoRI and NotI. The Y173F and R697L mutants of Vav3 were obtained by point mutagenesis using a mutagenesis kit from Invitrogen. Generation of the single mutation was verified by sequencing. The c-Myc-tagged Vav1 and the NFAT-luciferase reporter gene have been previously described (37Villalba M. Coudronniere N. Deckert M. Teixeiro E. Mas P. Altman A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 151-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The Vav3-specific short hairpin RNA interference (shVav3) and the mutated version (shVav3mt) have been previously described (16Zakaria S. Gomez T.S. Savoy D.N. McAdam S. Turner M. Abraham R.T. Billadeau D.D. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation of Jurkat T cells was performed as described (38Villalba M. Bi K. Hu J. Altman Y. Bushway P. Reits E. Neefjes J. Baier G. Abraham R.T. Altman A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, T cells were resuspended in ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cells were transferred to a 1-ml syringe and sheared by passing them five times through a 27-gauge needle. The lysates were centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and cell debris. The supernatant was transferred to ultracentrifuge Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytosol) was collected, and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 5 mm NaPiP, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), 20 mm NaPO4, pH 7.6, 3 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin), vortexed for 20 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged again at 45,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant representing the membrane fraction was saved, and the detergent-insoluble fraction (cytoskeleton) was resuspended in 1% SDS in water. Protein concentrations in the cytosolic and the membrane fraction were measured by the Bradford method, and each fraction was then diluted with Laemmli buffer to yield equal protein concentrations. Identical amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Murine primary T cells were isolated from pooled spleen and lymph nodes of wild-type mice by standard procedures and enriched to >85% purity using a mouse T cell enrichment column (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Primary T cells were activated for 48 h in plates coated with anti-CD3 mAb (10 μg/ml) plus soluble anti-CD28 mAb (5 μg/ml). The activated T cells were then cultured for 36 h without anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs but with recombinant human IL-2 (20 units/ml), washed, and restimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs (20 μg/ml) for the indicated times. The cells were then incubated in hypotonic buffer as described above, and 2 drops of polystyrene beads were added. Subcellular fractionation was performed as described above. IS Formation and Confocal Microscopy—For conjugation of Jurkat T cells, Raji B cells were used as APCs and stained with CMTMR (4 μm) in serum-free medium for 30 min at 37 °C, washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution, and incubated with or without SEE (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. After washings, these APCs were mixed with transfected Jurkat cells at a 1:1 ratio in Hanks' balanced salt solution for 10 min at 37 °C. T-APC conjugates were then plated on poly-l-lysine slides (Lab-scientific, Inc.) for 20 min at room temperature, fixed with PBS plus 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized with PBS plus 0.2% Triton X-100 for 4 min, blocked with PBS plus 1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min, stained with anti-c-Myc mAb for 30 min, washed several times in PBS, and incubated with an Alexafluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. After washing five times with PBS, the cells were mounted on glass slides using a drop of mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). The immunofluorescence images were recorded by a Marianas digital fluorescence microscopy system (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). The imaging system included a Zeiss Axiocam MRm charge-coupled device camera (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc., Thornwood, NY), a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging), a Zeiss Plan-Apo 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture objective, and excitation and emission filter wheels (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) with narrow band optical filters (Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT). Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations) controlled all of these components and was used for image capture and analysis. Immunoprecipitation—Jurkat T cells suspended in serum-free medium were incubated for 30 min on ice with anti-CD3 mAb in the presence or the absence of anti-CD28 (20 μg/ml each) mAb and cross-linked with goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) for 1 min at 37 °C with gentle shaking. The cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed as described above, and the lysates were collected after centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Immunoprecipitation was performed by adding the indicated antibodies plus 30 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubating the lysates overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Samples were washed three times with lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitates (IPs) were dissolved in 1× Laemmli buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Reporter Gene Assays—Jurkat T cells were transfected with an NFAT-luciferase reporter plasmid and a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid as described (37Villalba M. Coudronniere N. Deckert M. Teixeiro E. Mas P. Altman A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 151-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were stimulated for the last 6 h of culture, washed with PBS, and lysed, and luciferase or β-galactosidase activities were determined as described (37Villalba M. Coudronniere N. Deckert M. Teixeiro E. Mas P. Altman A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 151-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The results are expressed in arbitrary luciferase units normalized to β-galactosidase activity in the same cells. All experiments were performed at least three times with similar results. Vav3 Membrane Translocation Is Dependent on CD3 Stimulation—Vav1 and Vav3 are highly homologous proteins, but their respective roles during T cell activation have not been fully examined. We initially compared the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern of both proteins in T cells. The phosphorylation of Vav3 on Tyr173 and Vav1 on Tyr174 was maximal after 1 min of anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation and gradually decreased at later time points (Fig. 1, A and B). However, basal phosphorylation of Tyr174 in Vav1 was clearly detectable (Fig. 1B). The overall tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav3 and Vav1 followed a similar pattern, with a substantial basal phosphorylation and, therefore, less pronounced inducible phosphorylation of Vav1. We also analyzed the subcellular distribution of both proteins in wild-type Jurkat T cells (JE6.1). To this end, we stimulated JE6.1 cells with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 mAbs or, as a control, with PMA and analyzed Vav expression in purified cytosolic (c in Fig. 1), membrane (m), and detergent-insoluble (i) fractions. We observed a transient anti-CD3/CD28-induced translocation of Vav3, which peaked after 1 min of stimulation (Fig. 1C). However, a substantial fraction of Vav1 was constitutively present in the membrane of unstimulated cells, and this level remained unchanged following anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation (Fig. 1C). PMA stimulation did not increase the membrane translocation of either Vav3 or Vav1. Indicative of proper activation, stimulation with either anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs or PMA induced strong membrane translocation of PKCθ. p38 was present only in the cytoplasm, whereas LAT was present in both membrane and insoluble fractions (Fig. 1C, lower panels), demonstrating a proper purification of the different fractions. Next, we stimulated Jurkat T cells with anti-CD3 and/or CD28 antibodies and observed that membrane translocation of Vav3 was induced by anti-CD3 stimulation but not by anti-CD28 ligation (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, anti-CD28 stimulation did not increase the membrane translocation of Vav3 induced by the anti-CD3 mAb. In contrast, and as reported earlier (39Bi K. Tanaka Y. Coudronniere N. Sugie K. Hong S. van Stipdonk M.J. Altman A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), combined anti-CD3/CD28 costimulation enhanced the membrane translocation of PKCθ relative to the translocation induced by anti-CD3 alone. As before (Fig. 1C), the membrane localization of Vav1 remained unchanged in unstimulated versus stimulated cells (Fig. 1D). We also analyzed the subcellular distribution of Vav proteins in primary murine T cells and found that they displayed a similar behavior to that of Jurkat T cells. Thus, anti-CD3/CD28 costimulation induced membrane translocation of Vav3, which peaked 5 min post-stimulation and was still observed after 10 min (Fig. 1E). Costimulation of the same cells also induced a strong membrane translocation of PKCθ, but not of Vav1. Similar to Jurkat cells, PMA stimulation did not induce detectable membrane translocation of Vav3 or Vav1 (data not shown). To examine the membrane translocation of Vav proteins in the context of the IS, we stimulated Vav1- or Vav3-transfected Jurkat-TAg cells with Raji B lymphoma cells, which were either pulsed or not with a superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin E (SEE), and determined the localization of Vav proteins at the contact area (IS) formed between the T and B cells. Both Vav3 and Vav1 were concentrated in the IS in a stimulation-dependent manner (Fig. 1F). Taken together, our results suggest that Vav3 translocates to the plasma membrane and localizes to the IS upon T cell activation. Defective Vav3 Membrane Translocation in Jurkat Cells Lacking Lck, ZAP-70, SLP-76, or LAT—PTKs of the Src and Syk families regulate the localization and function of Vav proteins by inducing their tyrosine phosphorylation and association with other signaling enzymes and/or adapter proteins (13Deckert M.

Initially, we examined the effect of a specific Src family kinase inhibitor, protein phosphatase 2, on the membrane translocation of Vav3. Protein phosphatase 2 pretreatment completely reversed the anti-CD3/CD28-induced membrane translocation of Vav3 and, as a positive control (39Bi K. Tanaka Y. Coudronniere N. Sugie K. Hong S. van Stipdonk M.J. Altman A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), also that of PKCθ (Fig. 2A). As a control, treatment with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors, LY 294002 or wortmannin, had no effect on Vav3 membrane translocation (data not shown), indicating that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway was not involved in this process. Next, we took advantage of an Lck-deficient Jurkat cell line (JCam1.6) and confirmed that in the absence of Lck, anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation failed to induce membrane translocation of Vav3 translocation (Fig. 2B). As shown previously (39Bi K. Tanaka Y. Coudronniere N. Sugie K. Hong S. van Stipdonk M.J. Altman A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), PKCθ also failed to undergo membrane translocation in JCam1.6 cells. We then examined the membrane translocation of Vav3 in a ZAP-70-deficient cell line (P116) an"
https://openalex.org/W2038672689,"Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a 34-kDa resident of lipoproteins that plays a key role in cholesterol homeostasis in plasma and in brain. It is composed of an N-terminal (NT) domain (residues 1–191) and a C-terminal (CT) domain (residues 201–299). Of the three major isoforms (apoE2, -E3, and -E4), apoE4 is considered a risk factor for both cardiovascular and Alzheimer disease. Compared with apoE3, domain interaction between NT and CT domains is believed to direct the lipoprotein distribution preference of apoE4 for very low density lipoprotein-sized particles. We examined the relative disposition of apoE4 NT and CT domains in lipid-free and lipid-bound forms by monitoring pyrene excimer fluorescence emission as a direct indicator of spatial proximity. Site-specific labeling of apoE4 by N-(1-pyrene)maleimide was accomplished after substitution of Cys residues for Arg-61 in NT domain and Glu-255 in CT domain. Pyrene labeling did not alter the lipoprotein distribution pattern of apoE4 in plasma. Pyrene excimer fluorescence was noted in lipid-free pyrene-R61C/E255C/apoE4 in mixtures containing excess wild-type apoE4, which was attributed to intramolecular spatial proximity between these specified sites. Upon disruption of tertiary interaction, a large decrease in excimer fluorescence emission was noted in pyrene-R61C/E255C/apoE4. In dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine/pyrene-R61C/E255C/apoE4 discoidal complexes, pyrene excimer fluorescence emission was retained. Taken together with fluorescence quenching and cross-linking analysis, a looped-back model of apoE4 is proposed in lipid-bound state, including spherical lipoprotein particles, wherein residues Arg-61 and Glu-255 are proximal to one another."
https://openalex.org/W2095292889,"Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of death related to cancer in Western society. 2-Methoxyestradiol (2-ME), an endogenous metabolite of estradiol-17β, inhibits tumor angiogenesis while also exerting potent cytotoxic effects on various cancer cells. 2-ME has been shown to activate the p38 MAPK and JNK pathways and to induce apoptosis in cells, although the underlying molecular mechanisms for this are unknown. Here we report that the expression of Smad7, an adaptor molecule required to activate p38 MAPK in the transforming growth factor β signaling pathway, is also required for 2-ME-induced p38 activation and apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells (PC-3U). PC-3U/AS-S7 cells stably transfected with an antisense Smad7 construct, or PC-3U cells transiently transfected with short interfering RNA for Smad7, were protected against 2-ME-induced apoptosis. 2-ME-induced apoptosis was found to involve p38 MAPK and JNK, because simultaneous treatments with 2-ME and a specific p38 inhibitor (SB203580) or an inhibitor of JNK (L-JNK1) prevented 2-ME-induced apoptosis. Most interestingly, Smad7 was shown by both antisense and short interfering RNA techniques to affect levels of β-catenin, which has been implicated previously in the regulation of apoptosis. Moreover, Smad7 was found to be important for the basal expression of Bim, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, and for 2-ME-induced expression of Bim.

Moreover, Smad7 was found to be important for the basal expression of Bim, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, and for 2-ME-induced expression of Bim. These results suggest that expression of Smad7 is crucial for 2-ME-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells. The incidence of prostate cancer continues to increase, particularly in Western society, where the disease is now the second most common cancer-related cause of death (1Crawford E.D. Urology. 2003; 62: 3-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 2Gronberg H. Lancet. 2003; 361: 859-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Furthermore, advanced prostate cancer cannot be successfully treated, and the available therapeutic arsenal, including radiation and cytotoxic drugs, is often associated with severe side effects (3Kent E.C. Hussain M.H. Urology. 2003; 62: 134-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A key goal for cancer researchers is therefore to identify the novel therapeutic agents that can be used to treat cancer patients with fewer side effects. Over the past 10–20 years, our understanding of the mechanisms of tumor development and progression has increased enormously, and it has become clear that tumor progression is dependent on angiogenesis, because tumors will not grow to more than 1–2 mm3 in size if they lack a functional blood supply (4Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1971; 285: 1182-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 5Folkman J.

(2001) 285, 1259–1266Google Scholar). A point to be noted is that 2-ME does not cause apoptosis in normal mammary cells (7Bu S. Blaukat A. Fu X. Heldin N.E. Landström M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Pribluda V.S. Gubish Jr., E.R. Lavallee T.M. Treston A. Swartz G.M. Green S.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2000; 19: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). A pronounced reduction of tumor burden has been reported for breast, lung, and androgen-independent prostate cancers in vivo (7Bu S. Blaukat A. Fu X. Heldin N.E. Landström M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Schumacher G. Neuhaus P. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 7: 405-410Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The effect of 2-ME, or metabolites of it, has been investigated in vivo, and the adverse side effects of systemic administration of 2-ME appear to be small (4Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1971; 285: 1182-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 5Folkman J. APMIS. 2003; 112: 496-507Crossref Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 7Bu S. Blaukat A. Fu X. Heldin N.E. Landström M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The potent cytotoxic effects of 2-ME on both tumor cells and endothelial cells, together with its low toxicity to the whole organism, make 2-ME an interesting and suitable drug for the treatment of various cancers. 2-ME or the metabolites of 2-ME are currently being evaluated in phase I and phase II clinical trials for the treatment of cancer patients. The molecular mechanism for growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis by 2-ME is not completely understood, although the effect of 2-ME on cellular fate has been intensively investigated in recent years (9Pribluda V.S. Gubish Jr., E.R. Lavallee T.M. Treston A. Swartz G.M. Green S.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2000; 19: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 10Schumacher G. Neuhaus P. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 7: 405-410Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It was reported by Fotsis et al. (11Fotsis T. Zhang Y. Pepper M.S. Adlercreutz H. Montesano R. Nawroth P.P. Schweigerer L. Nature. 1994; 368: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) that 2-ME results in increased stability of the microtubule system, which probably contributes to its growth-inhibitory properties. 2-ME has also been reported to cause activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), which are important transducers of signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus. Stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK are regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and environmental stresses such as UV light, γ-irradiation, heat shock, osmotic shock, shear stress, and growth factor withdrawal. Activation of JNK promotes an apoptotic response, because of its regulatory effects on the activation protein (AP-1) down-stream of JNK and c-Jun, as well as on p53 (12Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3641) Google Scholar, 13Wilkinson M.G. Millar J.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Shimada K. Nakamura M. Ishida E. Kishi M. Konishi N. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 6: 1067-1075Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As different forms of extracellular stress are known to activate the p38 and JNK pathways, and because 2-ME treatment also promotes activation of p38 and JNK, it appears that 2-ME treatment leads to the activation of a pathway that resembles the situation of unspecific extracellular stress, as the 2-ME effects have been demonstrated to occur independently of the described estrogen receptors (α and β; see Ref. 15LaVallee T.M. Zhan X.H. Herbstritt C.J. Kough E.C. Green S.J. Pribluda V.S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3691-3697PubMed Google Scholar). 2-ME seems to specifically cause growth inhibition and apoptosis of rapidly growing transformed cells, while sparing normal cells, because of its inhibitory effects on the transcription of superoxide dismutase enzymes (16Huang P. Feng L. Oldham E.A. Keating M.J. Plunkett W. Nature. 2000; 407: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutase protects cells from damage caused by superoxide (O2˙¯), a toxic free radical that is a product of aerobic metabolism. As tumors cells are more dependent on the activity of superoxide dismutase, this effect could be one possible mechanism explaining why tumor cells are more prone than normal cells to undergo apoptosis when treated with 2-ME. Smad7 is an adaptor protein belonging to the Smad family. Smad proteins are divided into three groups as follows: receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads), common mediator Smads (Co-Smads), and inhibitory Smads (I-Smads: Smad6 and Smad7). The Smads act as transducers (R-Smads) or modulators (Co-Smads and I-Smads) of the TGF-β signal from the activated TGF-β receptor complex at the cell membrane to the nucleus, where they regulate the transcription of genes. Smad7 was initially identified as an inhibitory Smad, because it can compete with R-Smads for binding to the receptor, thereby preventing the activation of the R-Smads (17Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar, 18Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.H. J.

The expression of Smad7 is regulated not only by TGF-β or bone morphogenic protein but also by tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ (20Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4283) Google Scholar). Smad7 has been shown to be required for TGF-β-induced activation of p38 MAPK and subsequent apoptosis of prostate cancer cells (21Landström M. Heldin N.E. Bu S. Hermansson A. Itoh S. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 535-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22Edlund S. Bu S. Schuster N. Aspenström P. Heldin N.E. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Landström M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Moreover, ectopic expression of Smad7 has been demonstrated to cause JNK activation and apoptosis of cancer cells, such as mink lung carcinoma cells and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (23Mazars A. Lallemand F. Prunier C. Marais J. Ferrand N. Pessah M. Cherqui G. Atfi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36797-36803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the present study we used antisense and siRNA techniques to investigate whether the expression of Smad7 facilitates 2-ME-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, as well as to study the specific molecular mechanisms related to Smad7. Our results suggest that Smad7 plays an important role in the activation of p38 MAPK and the stabilization of β-catenin. Most interestingly, Smad7 also appears to be crucial for regulation of the pro-apoptotic molecule Bim. Materials—2-ME was obtained from Sigma. SB203580 was obtained from Calbiochem and L-JNK1 from Alexis. Cell Culture and Reagents—The human prostate cancer cell line PC-3U, originating from PC-3 cells (21Landström M. Heldin N.E. Bu S. Hermansson A. Itoh S. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 535-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and antisense Smad7 PC-3U cells (PC-3U/AS-S7) were routinely grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, l -glutamine, and penicillin (Invitrogen). PC-3U/AS-S7 cells were grown in the presence of gentamycin to maintain selection pressure, as described previously (21Landström M. Heldin N.E. Bu S. Hermansson A. Itoh S. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 535-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In all assays, 2-ME treatment was given at 10 ng/ml in medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum, unless otherwise indicated. The specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Calbiochem) and the JNK inhibitor L-JNK1 (Alexis) were used at concentrations of 10 μm. The inhibitor was added to media 1 h before stimulation of cells with 2-ME. Western Blot Analysis—Cells grown in 10-cm dishes were treated with 10 μm of 2-ME for different times, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation, supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis in 10–12% polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were probed with antibodies against the following proteins: phosphorylated and total SAPK/JNK, phosphorylated and total p38 (Cell Signaling, Biolab, Beverly, MA), c-Myc, Smad7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), β-catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories), and Bim (Affinity BioReagents). Signals were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescent system. Detection of Apoptotic Nuclei by DAPI and M30 Stainings—PC-3U and PC-3U/AS-S7 cells were treated or not with L-JNK1 or with SB203580, either alone or together with 2-ME. The inhibitor was added to the media 1 h before 2-ME was administered to the cells for 12 h. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution for 10 min for DAPI stainings. Thereafter, the slides were stained as described previously (24Davoodpour P. Bergstrom M. Landström M. Nucl. Med. Biol. 2004; 7: 867-874Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The number of nuclei showing morphological characteristics of apoptosis, such as pyknosis and fragmentation, was counted as positive in a Zeiss immunofluorescence microscope at ×40 magnification. Three samples from each treatment group were evaluated. For each sample, at least 1000 nuclei were counted. In order to further validate the apoptotic effect of 2-ME, the fixation of cells was performed in ice-cold methanol for M30 stainings. M30 is an antibody that specifically recognizes caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18. The cells were stained with M30 according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The number of positive cells was counted in a Zeiss immunofluorescence microscope at ×40 magnification. At least 1000 nuclei/sample were counted. RNA Preparation—Twenty one-base pair siRNA duplexes for Smad7 were synthesized by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). The targeted sequence for the Smad7 siRNA duplex (5′-AA GCU CAA UUC GGA CAA CAA G-3′), or a nonspecific duplex oligonucleotide used as a negative control, was transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) at a ratio of 1 μg of RNA to 3 μl of Lipofectamine. 2-ME was added 24 h after transfection, and the immunofluorescence experiments were carried out after an additional 12 h. Smad7 Facilitates 2-ME-induced Apoptosis in Prostate Cancer Cells—To investigate the possible role of Smad7 in 2-ME-induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells, we applied an anti-sense approach. PC-3U cells and PC-3U/AS-S7 cells, stably transfected with an antisense Smad7 construct, were treated with 10 μm 2-ME for 12 h in the presence or absence of the p38 inhibitor SB203580 or L-JNK1. The inhibitors were added 1 h before the treatment was initiated. The cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol and thereafter permeabilized and stained with M30 antibodies. The nuclei were stained with DAPI. Apoptotic cells were identified by morphological criteria such as nuclear fragmentation or pyknosis. To validate the proapoptotic effect of 2-ME identified by DAPI staining, the number of cells stained with M30, which specifically recognizes caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18 in cells, was counted, as described previously (22Edlund S. Bu S. Schuster N. Aspenström P. Heldin N.E. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Landström M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 24Davoodpour P. Bergstrom M. Landström M. Nucl. Med. Biol. 2004; 7: 867-874Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). 2-ME potently induced apoptosis in PC-3U cells, but not in PC-3U/ASS7 cells which had a reduced level of Smad7 (21Landström M. Heldin N.E. Bu S. Hermansson A. Itoh S. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 535-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22Edlund S. Bu S. Schuster N. Aspenström P. Heldin N.E. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Landström M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Treatment with 1 μm staurosporine for 8 h served as a control. 2-ME-induced apoptosis was partly prevented when cells were treated simultaneously with either SB203580 or L-JNK1 (see Fig. 1, A–D). To verify the specificity of the inhibitors used, L-JNK1 and SB203580, cell lysates from PC-3U cells treated or not either with 2-ME alone, with each inhibitor alone, or in combination with 2-ME were investigated with immunoblotting for phosphorylated ATF-2. We observed a robust phosphorylation of ATF-2 after 1 h of treatment with 2-ME, which was repressed by simultaneous treatment with SB203580 or L-JNK1, demonstrating that in the presence of the inhibitors, p38 and JNK could not phosphorylate their substrate ATF-2 (data not shown). From these results we conclude that expression of Smad7 facilitates 2-ME-induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. In addition, 2-ME treatment leads to activation of the p38 MAPK and JNK pathways in line with previous reports. Activation of p38 or JNK causes subsequent apoptosis, because simultaneous treatment with either SB203580 or L-JNK1 reduced the apoptotic response in PC-3U cells. Expression of Smad7 Is Required for 2-ME-induced Activation of p38 MAPK—Next we investigated by Western blot the effects of 2-ME treatment on the activation of JNK and p38 MAPK in PC-3U and PC-3U/AS-S7 cells at different time periods after the 2-ME treatment (Fig. 2, A and B). JNK phosphorylation was difficult to detect in PC-3U cells, although p38 MAPK was activated after 60 min. In contrast, treatment of PC-3U/AS-S7 cells with 2-ME did not cause activation of either JNK or p38 (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas osmotic shock caused a robust activation of both kinases to the same extent in both cell lines. The expression of Smad7 was investigated on the same filter as was used in the experiment in Fig. 2B. 2-ME treatment caused an increase of the Smad7 protein at 60 and 120 min (Fig. 2C). Its expression was significantly lower in the PC-3U/AS-S7 cells. Lysates from cells stably transfected with pMEP4/FLAG-Smad7 (clone I cells) were used as a positive control for the Smad7 antibody. From these results we conclude that the expression of Smad7 is required for 2-ME-induced activation of p38 MAPK. Expression of Smad7 Is Required for 2-ME-induced Stabilization of β-Catenin and c-Myc—We subsequently investigated whether Smad7 expression and 2-ME affected β-catenin and c-Myc proteins, as they have been implicated previously in the regulation of apoptosis (25Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2773) Google Scholar, 26Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar, 27Olmeda D. Castel S. Vilaro S. Cano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 7: 2844-2860Crossref Google Scholar, 28Edlund S. Lee S.Y. Grimsby S. Zhang S. Aspenström P. Heldin C.H. Landström M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 4: 1475-1488Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Treatment with 2-ME caused increased stability of β-catenin, an effect that was more pronounced in PC-3U cells than in PC-3U/AS-S7 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The same filters were stripped, blocked, and reprobed with an anti-actin antibody, which served as an internal control for loading of equal amounts of protein in each lane. c-Myc is a proto-oncogene product implicated in apoptosis, in particular when cells lack survival signals (25Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2773) Google Scholar, 26Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar). It should be observed that c-myc is transcriptionally regulated by β-catenin in the Wnt signaling pathway (29Barker N. Clevers H. BioEssays. 2000; 11: 961-965Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It is therefore of potential general interest to note that 2-ME treatment causes a slightly increased level of expression of c-Myc in PC-3U cells but not in PC-3U/AS-S7 cells (Fig. 3C). Expression of Smad7 Is Required for 2-ME-induced Expression of Bim—Bim is a pro-apoptotic BH3 molecule belonging to the Bcl-2 family. The expression of Bim is regulated at the transcriptional level by c-Myc, JNK, and p53 (30Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 5: 505-512Crossref Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 31Lei K. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2432-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 32Burns T.F. El-Deiry W.S. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 4: 431-443Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, Smad3 has been shown recently to regulate the expression of Bim in a hematopoietic cell line (33Wildey G.M. Patil S. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18069-18077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We therefore wanted to investigate the possibility of 2-ME treatment and Smad7 expression regulating the expression of Bim. It should be noted that the basal level of Bim was significantly reduced in PC-3U/AS-S7 cells, compared with PC-3U cells. Moreover, 2-ME treatment caused an increase in the expression of Bim only in PC-3U cells and not in PC-3U/AS-S7 cells (Fig. 4). Our results thus demonstrate that Smad7 is an important regulator of Bim expression in prostate cancer cells. Smad7 appears to regulate expression of Bim together with p38 MAPK, leading to subsequent apoptosis induced by 2-ME treatment. Importance of Smad7 for 2-ME-induced Apoptosis and Regulation of p38 MAPK, β-Catenin, c-Myc, and Bim as Investigated by siRNA—In order to further investigate the significance of our previous data, which had shown that the expression of Smad7 was required for 2-ME-induced apoptosis and regulation of p38 MAPK, β-catenin, and Bim, we next used siRNA for Smad7 to suppress endogenous levels of the protein in PC-3U cells. PC-3U cells transiently transfected with either control or specific siRNA for Smad7 were treated or not with 2-ME for 12 h, after which the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and DAPI stainings were performed. The number of apoptotic cells present in the control group was higher than in cells transiently transfected with specific siRNA for Smad7, as shown in Fig. 5A. Lysates from cells transfected with control or specific siRNA for Smad7, treated or not with 2-ME for the time points indicated, were used for immunoblotting to analyze the levels of Smad7 and phosphorylated p38 (Fig. 5B). The filters were reprobed with antibodies against actin or total p38, respectively, and thus served as controls for loading of proteins (Fig. 5B). The same lysates were used to investigate the effects of Smad7 expression on the amounts of β-catenin, c-Myc, and Bim, as shown in Fig. 5C. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, A–C, we observed that in PC-3U cells, where endogenous levels of Smad7 were repressed by specific siRNA for Smad7, the 2-ME-induced apoptotic response was reduced, as were the increases in phosphorylated p38, β-catenin, c-Myc, and Bim, indicating that Smad7 is required for the proper regulation of these proteins and for subsequent apoptosis. We report a previously undescribed 2-ME-initiated apoptotic pathway in which Smad7 plays an important role in the activation of p38, the stabilization of β-catenin, and the expression of the pro-apoptotic molecule Bim. 2-ME and its derivatives are promising antitumor agents because of their potent growth-inhibitory and apoptotic effects on both endothelial and tumor cells. Fotsis et al. (11Fotsis T. Zhang Y. Pepper M.S. Adlercreutz H. Montesano R. Nawroth P.P. Schweigerer L. Nature. 1994; 368: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) originally described the potent inhibitory effects of 2-ME on angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo. Treatment with 2-ME was found to lead to a stabilization of the microtubule system, which explained its growth-inhibitory effects. The cytotoxic effect exerted by 2-ME on tumor cells appears to involve activation of p38 and JNK, although the precise molecular mechanism has not yet been described (7Bu S. Blaukat A. Fu X. Heldin N.E. Landström M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Shimada K. Nakamura M. Ishida E. Kishi M. Konishi N. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 6: 1067-1075Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Smad7 belongs to the Smad family, whose members act as transducers (receptor-activated Smads: Smad2 and Smad3), mediators (Smad4), or modulators (Smad6 and Smad7) down-stream of the activated TGF-β receptor complex (17Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar, 19Shi Y. Massagué J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4818) Google Scholar). Smad7 has been shown to be necessary for the TGF-β-induced activation of p38 and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells and in immortalized keratinocytes, as reported previously by us (22Edlund S. Bu S. Schuster N. Aspenström P. Heldin N.E. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Landström M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We also found that Smad7 acts as an adaptor molecule bringing MKK-3 and p38 MAPK molecules together (22Edlund S. Bu S. Schuster N. Aspenström P. Heldin N.E. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Landström M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Smad7 leads to activation of JNK, which is associated with apoptosis, as observed in mink lung cancer cells (23Mazars A. Lallemand F. Prunier C. Marais J. Ferrand N. Pessah M. Cherqui G. Atfi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36797-36803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These reports thus suggest that Smad7 might play an important role not only in the TGF-β signaling pathway but also in activation of the p38 and JNK pathways. In the current study we observe that Smad7 expression is required for 2-ME-induced activation of p38 and subsequent apoptosis, suggesting that Smad7 could be implicated in the activation of p38 in 2-ME-treated cells. We observe that 2-ME treatment leads to stabilization of Smad7. The stability of the Smad7 protein is regulated by acetylation or ubiquitination of the protein by acetyltransferases like p300 (34Grönroos E. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 3: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (289) Google Scholar) or ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases such as Smurf1 and -2 (35Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T.

Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1365-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, UV irradiation leads to increased stability of Smad7 (37Quan T. He T. Voorhees J.J. Fisher G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26349-26356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Increased activity of the Smad7 promoter via induction of the transcription factor AP-1, induced by UV irradiation, has been reported recently, indicating that UV irradiation might lead to increased transcription of the Smad7 gene (38Quan T. He T. Voorhees J.J. Fisher G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8079-8085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As the effects of 2-ME treatment lead to activation of the transcription factor AP-1, in future experiments it would be exciting to study whether the 2-ME-induced increase in Smad7 is on its promoter level or not. Epithelial cells are dependent on their adhesion to the sub-stratum and their neighbors for survival, and in the absence of such survival signals they are destined to undergo programmed cell death or apoptosis. This kind of apoptosis is called anoikis, and the BH3-only proteins Bmf and Bim are reported to be activated by this process (39Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 5: 701-706Crossref Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 40Reed J.C. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1999; 1: 68-75Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 41Puthalakath H. Villunger A. O'Reilly L.A.

Among the target genes for the active β-catenin-LEF1/TCF complex are c-myc and cyclin D1 (29Barker N. Clevers H. BioEssays. 2000; 11: 961-965Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). c-myc is a proto-oncogene that in the absence of growth factors causes apoptosis of cells (26Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar). Having recently observed that Smad7 plays an important role in the stabilization of β-catenin, the subsequent increase of c-Myc, and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells exposed to TGF-β (28Edlund S. Lee S.Y. Grimsby S. Zhang S. Aspenström P. Heldin C.H. Landström M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 4: 1475-1488Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we postulated that Smad7 might regulate levels of β-catenin in cells exposed to other types of extracellular stress, such as 2-ME treatment. We observed that 2-ME treatment led to a stabilization of β-catenin and c-Myc that was dependent on the expression of Smad7, as it was not observed in cells where Smad7 expression was repressed by antisense or siRNA techniques. It is possible that the stress response induced by 2-ME in PC-3U cells leads to activation of p38, which in turn causes an increase in levels of β-catenin, in a manner similar to that reported previously by us (28Edlund S. Lee S.Y. Grimsby S. Zhang S. Aspenström P. Heldin C.H. Landström M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 4: 1475-1488Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar) for PC-3U cells treated with TGF-β. The dual function of β-catenin in the maintenance of cell adhesion or, when accumulated, in gene transcription of c-myc could be a way for the organism to eliminate cells that have lost their social control, as Raff (42Raff M.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 297-300Crossref Scopus (2495) Google Scholar) has suggested. Further studies are needed to examine precisely how 2-ME treatment leads to an accumulation of β-catenin. The association between β-catenin and E-cadherin is likely to be under the control of growth factors, as treatment of cells with hepatocyte growth factor or activation of oncogenic RON receptor tyrosine kinase causes a tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin that will lead to its dissociation from E-cadherin (43Danilkovitch-Miagkova A. Miagkov A. Skeel A. Nakaigawa N. Zbar B. Leonard E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 17: 5857-5868Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In this way, growth factors may regulate the amount of free β-catenin in the cytoplasm. Bim is a member of the Bcl-2 family with pro-apoptotic effects, because it possesses only a BH3 domain. In resting cells, Bim is kept inactive by its association with dynein, a motor protein complex on the microtubule system. In cells with active JNK, Bim becomes phosphorylated, is released from dynein, and is thus able to associate with other members of the Bcl-2 family and prevent their anti-apoptotic functions (31Lei K. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2432-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). In the presence of large amounts of Bim, cytochrome c can be released from the mitochondria, leading to apoptosis of the cell (30Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 5: 505-512Crossref Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, Bim is also regulated on the transcriptional level by JNK, p53, and c-Myc (32Burns T.F. El-Deiry W.S. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 4: 431-443Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 44Harris C.A. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Biol.

Neuron. 2001; 3: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (505) Google Scholar). We observed that Smad7 plays an important role in regulating the expression of Bim, as levels of Bim were significantly lower in cells where Smad7 expression was reduced by antisense or siRNA techniques. Moreover, 2-ME treatment increased the amount of Bim in a Smad7-dependent manner. As we also observed that 2-ME treatment leads to activation of p38 and increased c-Myc levels, our data suggest that p38 might also contribute to the regulation of Bim. In conclusion, 2-ME-induced apoptosis is linked to activation of the p38 and JNK pathways, as reported previously. Our current data suggest that the expression of Smad7 in prostate cancer cells plays an important role in the 2-ME-induced activation of the stress-related response of p38, which in turn appears to be closely connected to the regulation of β-catenin, c-Myc, and also the pro-apoptotic molecule Bim. Further investigations of the correlation between Smad7 expression and prognosis in human prostate cancer cells are warranted to provide a better understanding of the biological role of Smad7 in vivo, as our results predict that the expression of Smad7 might be correlated to the response of different treatment modalities in patients with prostate cancer.

Gene duplication of a common SUMF ancestor gene obviously has occurred at the level of a single exon gene after the evolution of insects and before that of deuterostomia. The function of the SUMF2-encoded paralog of FGE (pFGE) is unknown. Cotransfection of SUMF2 with sulfatase cDNAs such as those of arylsulfatase A, C, or E enhanced moderately, but consistently, the catalytic activity of the sulfatases, suggesting that pFGE has some FGly-generating activity (13Cosma M.P.

So far, no mutations in the SUMF2 gene have been found in multiple sulfatase deficiency patients. In the present study, we have analyzed the expression of SUMF2 and the structural and functional properties of recombinant and endogenous pFGE and examined the interaction with and modifying activity of pFGE on sulfatases. Cloning of Human pFGE Encoding cDNA (SUMF2)—Total RNA, prepared from human fibroblasts using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), was reverse-transcribed using the Omniscript reverse transcriptase kit (Qiagen), and either an oligo(dT) primer or the SUMF2-specific primer 1072nc (5′-GGAAGGGGAAGTTCTTTCC-3′). The first strand cDNA was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 1c (5′-ATGCGCAGCGGGGCCGTGG-3′) and, as reverse primer, either 1072nc or 1049nc (5′-GCTGAAGCTCTCGAGCTTGG-3′). The PCR products were cloned directly into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). By sequencing multiples of the cloned PCR products, which had been obtained from various individuals and from independent reverse transcriptase and PCR reactions, the cDNA sequence coding for pFGE (906 bp from start to stop codon) was established. The sequence corresponds to GenBank™ entry NM_015411 but deviates in one position (87C>T). This change is a silent mutation in the third position of the serine 29 codon and may reflect a polymorphism. Construction of Expression Plasmids—The pFGE encoding cDNA was equipped with a 5′ BamHI site and a 3′ RGS-His6 tag sequence followed by a stop codon and a XbaI site, by add-on PCR using Pfu Ultra polymerase (Stratagene) and primers 5′-CGGGATCCACCATGGCCCGGCATGGGTTAC-3′ (BamHI) and 5′-GCTCTAGATTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCGATCCTCTCAGCTCCCCTGGCGGC-3′ (RGS-His6-XbaI). The resulting PCR product was cloned as a BamHI/XbaI fragment downstream of the cytomegalovirus promotor of the expression vector pSB4.7pA, which was provided by Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. (Cambridge, MA). For coexpression of FGE or pFGE with steroid sulfatase, the pBI vector (BD Biosciences) was used, which allows expression of two cDNAs from a bidirectional tet-responsive promotor. The FGE-(14) and pFGE-encoding cDNAs were equipped with a 5′ EcoRV site and a 3′ HA tag sequence followed by a stop codon and a NotI site, by add-on PCR using Pfu Ultra polymerase (Stratagene) and the following primers: 5′-GGATATCGGGACAACATGGCTGCG-3′ (EcoRV-FGE); 5′-GGATATCACCATGGCCCGGCATGGGTTAC-3′ (EcoRV-pFGE); 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCTTATGCGTAGTCAGGCACATCATACGGATAGTCCATGGTGGGCAGGC-3′ (FGE-HA-NotI); 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCTTATGCGTAGTCAGGCACATCATACGGATACAGCTCCCCTGGCGGC-3′ (pFGE-HA-NotI). The EcoRV/NotI-digested PCR products were inserted into the multiple cloning site II of the pBI vector that had been opened by PstI, blunted with T4-polymerase/dNTPs, and cut with NotI. It should be noted that after ligation, the initial EcoRV and PstI sites were destroyed. Into the multiple cloning site I of the obtained constructs and of the empty pBI vector, the steroid sulfatase cDNA was cloned as an NheI/EcoRV fragment. This fragment was generated from a PCR product that was obtained using pBEH-STS (17Stein C. Hille A. Seidel J. Rijnbout S. Waheed A. Schmidt B. Geuze H. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13865-13872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as template, Pfu Ultra polymerase, and add-on primers 5′-CTAGCTAGCCACCATGCCTTTAAGGAAGATGAAG-3′ (NheI) and 5′-GGATATCAGCGGCTCAGTCTCTTATCC-3′ (EcoRV). Northern Blot Analysis—A human multitissue Northern blot (BD Biosciences) was hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes covering the entire coding regions of FGE or pFGE, respectively, and a β-actin cDNA probe as a control for RNA loading. Basically the same result, as shown below (see Fig. 1), was obtained when using probes hybridizing in the 3′-untranslated regions of SUMF1 or SUMF2 mRNA, in which the two sequences show no similarity (not shown). It was verified before each hybridization round that no radioactivity had remained from the previous hybridization. For technical details, see Ref. 18Lübke T. Marquart T. Etzioni A.

Cell Culture and Transfections—HT-1080 cells and human skin fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfection was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 following the protocol recommended by Invitrogen. Typically, 4 μg of plasmid DNA were used per 6-cm dish. For coexpression experiments, the cells were transfected with a mix of 2 μg of pBI vector containing pFGE-(or FGE-) and steroid sulfatase-encoding cDNAs plus 2 μg of rtTA plasmid (reverse tetracycline controlled transactivator, BD Biosciences). For triple expression experiments, the cells were transfected with a mixture of three plasmids: 1 μg of pBI vector containing only pFGE cDNA, 1 μg of pBI vector containing FGE, and steroid sulfatase cDNAs and 2 μg of rtTA vector. After 6 h, the medium was replaced with medium containing 1 μg/ml doxycyline (BD Biosciences), and 30 h later, the cells were harvested for further analysis. For stable transfection, HT-1080 cells were transfected with pSB-pFGE-His (see above). Clones were selected and screened according to Ref. 19Preusser-Kunze A. Mariappan M. Schmidt B. Gande S.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4617-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) (1:10 ratio). Transfectants were selected in normal growth medium containing puromycin (Invitrogen) with an increasing concentration from 0.2 to 0.8 μg/ml and screened by Western blotting. Purification of Recombinant pFGE-His—HT-1080 cells stably overexpressing pFGE-His were grown to near confluence in normal growth medium. Then medium was collected every 48 h, cleared by spinning, and subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation as described (19Preusser-Kunze A. Mariappan M. Schmidt B. Gande S.L. Mutenda K.

The precipitate was reconstituted in and dialyzed against lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The dialyzed material was cleared (142,000 × g, Ti45 rotor, 30 min, 4 °C) and subjected to Ni-NTA affinity chromatography under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Peak fractions, analyzed by Western blotting, were pooled and dialyzed overnight against Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol). The dialyzed pFGE-His was applied to a MonoQ HR10/10 anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A. The pFGE-His protein was recovered in the flow-through and concentrated in an Ultra Thimble UH 100/25 (Schleicher & Schuell). Indirect Immunofluorescence and Immunoelectron Microscopy—To detect endogenous expression of pFGE, human skin fibroblasts were grown on coverslips for 2 days. For recombinant expression of pFGE, the HT-1080 cells were grown on coverslips and cotransfected with pBI-pFGE-HA and rtTA plasmids, as described above. After 36 h of transfection, the cells were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence as described (19Preusser-Kunze A. Mariappan M. Schmidt B. Gande S.L. Mutenda K. Wenzel D. von Figura K. Dierks T. J.

For colocalization studies, rabbit pFGE-His antiserum or monoclonal antibodies against the HA tag (Covance Inc., Princeton, NJ) were used as primary antibodies. The endoplasmic reticulum marker protein, protein disulfide isomerase, was detected with a monoclonal antibody of IgG2A subtype (StressGen Biotechnologies). The primary antibodies were detected with isotype-specific goat secondary antibodies coupled to Cy2 or Cy3 (Molecular Probes), respectively. Confocal images were taken on a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS laser scan microscope. For immunoelectron microscopy, ultrathin cryosections were prepared as described (19Preusser-Kunze A. Mariappan M. Schmidt B.

For immunolabeling, sections were incubated with a polyclonal antibody against pFGE (1:25) for 30 min followed by a 20-min incubation with protein A-gold (10 nm). After washing steps, sections were fixed for 5 min with 1% glutaraldehyde. Sections were then quenched with glycine and blocked with bovine serum albumin before they were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against protein disulfide isomerase (1:30, StressGen Biotechnologies) or LAMP I (1:25, Hybridoma Bank) followed by a bridge antibody for 30 min (rabbit anti-mouse) and protein A-gold (5 nm) for 20 min. Sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate/methyl-cellulose for 10 min on ice, embedded in the same solution, and examined with a Philips CM120 electron microscope. Endoglucosaminidase H/PNGase Treatment and Immunoprecipitation—HT-1080 cells stably expressing pFGE-His were grown to confluence. After 48 h in fresh medium, cells and medium were collected for partial purification of pFGE-His by Ni-NTA chromatography and endoglucosaminidase H or PNGase treatment as described (19Preusser-Kunze A.

Limited Proteolysis and Protein Sequence Analysis—pFGE-His purified from the secretion of HT-1080 cells was treated with thermolysin or elastase in phosphate-buffered saline at a protein/protease ratio of 25:1 (w/w) for up to 24 h at ambient temperature. For further analysis of the digests by SDS-PAGE and N-terminal sequencing of the proteolytic fragments, see Ref. 19Preusser-Kunze A. Mariappan M. Schmidt B. Gande S.L. Mutenda K.

Reductive Carbamidomethylation and Tryptic Digestion, MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry, and Edman Sequencing—Reductive carbamidomethylation and tryptic digestion of purified pFGE-His were done, as described (19Preusser-Kunze A.

To keep disulfide bridges intact, reduction with dithiothreitol has been omitted in one experiment. Also MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing have been described (19Preusser-Kunze A.

Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Normal human skin fibroblasts were grown to near confluence in 3-cm dishes, starved in 2 ml of methionine and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h, and pulsed for 6 h with 2 ml of medium containing 50 μCi of 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Cells were harvested either directly or after washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline and culturing in 2 ml of chase medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum) for another 16 h (chase). Medium was collected, and cells were harvested by scraping. Immunoprecipitation of pFGE from cells and medium was performed with a pFGE anti-serum according to a protocol described earlier (21Gieselmann V. Schmidt B. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13262-13266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pellets were finally solubilized and subjected to SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging (BAS1000, Raytest). Densitometric quantification of pFGE was done using the MacBAS software (Fuji). Activity Assays for Sulfatases and FGE—Activity assays of FGE, steroid sulfatase, and galactose 6-sulfatase were performed as described earlier (14Dierks T. Schmidt B. Borissenko L.V. Peng J.

For Western blot analysis, steroid sulfatase antiserum, galactose 6-sulfatase monoclonal antibodies (provided by Transkaryotic Therapies Inc., Cambridge, MA), and HA tag monoclonal antibodies (see above) were used as primary antibodies, which were detected with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies. The Western blot signals were quantified by using the AIDA 2.1 software package (Raytest). Photocross-linking—For photoaffinity labeling, a benzophenone-labeled peptide was synthesized corresponding to arylsulfatase A (residues 60–80) with an additional ϵ-biotinylated lysine residue at the N terminus, an additional serine amide at the C terminus, and a p-benzoyl phenylalanine replacing leucine 77. The reaction mixture, containing 50 μm benzophenone-labeled peptide, 1 μm pFGE-His, bovine serum albumin, or FGE-His was photocross-linked and analyzed by Western blotting as described (19Preusser-Kunze A.

Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—The human pFGE cDNA (encoding residues 26–301) was inserted into the pGBKT7 bait vector (BD Biosciences) in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain-encoding sequence. The human FGE cDNA (encoding amino acids 87–374) or ASA cDNA (encoding residues 19–114) was cloned into the pGADT7 prey vector (BD Biosciences) containing the GAL4 DNA-activating domain. Cotransformation of yeast cells (AH109), selection of cotransformants, and analysis for expression of HIS3, ADE2, and MEL1 reporters was performed, as described (19Preusser-Kunze A. Mariappan M.

Expression of SUMF2—A single SUMF2 transcript of 2.0–2.1 kb is detectable by Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas (Fig. 1A) and of total RNA from skin fibroblasts (not shown). The expression pattern compares well with that of SUMF1 (Fig. 1B), the relative ratio of SUMF2 over SUMF1 varying between 0.5 in heart and 1.4 in brain and pancreas. Relative to β-actin RNA (not shown), the abundance of SUMF2 RNA varies by one order of magnitude, being highest in pancreas and kidney and lowest in brain. Characterization of Recombinant pFGE—pFGE with a C-terminal HA tag was transiently expressed in the human HT-1080 sarcoma cell line. pFGE colocalized with protein disulfide isomerase, a lumenal protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 2, A–C). In some cells, such as those shown in Fig. 2, A–C, a fraction of pFGE was associated with perinuclear structures devoid of protein disulfide isomerase. This structure is enriched in the Golgi marker protein GM130 (not shown). This indicates that recombinant pFGE is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, but in some cells, can also accumulate in detectable amounts in the Golgi apparatus. Immunoelectronmicroscopy confirmed the localization of pFGE in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it colocalizes with protein disulfide isomerase (Fig. 3A) and in the Golgi stack (Fig. 3B). A sparse labeling for pFGE was observed in structures enriched in the endosomal/lysosomal marker LAMP I (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Localization of pFGE-His in HT-1080 cells by immunoelectron microscopy. After fixation and cryosectioning, pFGE was detected with a rabbit antiserum against pFGE and protein A-gold (10 nm). A shows double labeling with the endoplasmic reticulum marker protein disulfide isomerase (5 nm gold), and B shows double labeling with the endosome/lysosome marker LAMP I (5 nm gold). ER, GApp, and MVB designate endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and multivesicular bodies, respectively. The scale bar corresponds to 100 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Overexpressed pFGE-His is only transiently retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. In HT-1080 cells, most of the pFGE-His that was synthesized over a period of 2 days (93% of total) was secreted. During that period, the cellular pFGE was kept at a rather constant level (Fig. 4). pFGE contains a single potential N-glycosylation site at Asn-191. The intracellular 32-kDa pFGE-His was sensitive to endoglucosaminidase H and PNGaseF. Both endoglycosidases decreased the apparent molecular size of the intracellular pFGE by 2.5 kDa (Fig. 5), indicating that intracellular pFGE contains a high mannose (or hybrid) type oligosaccharide. The secreted pFGE is represented by a 31.5- and 32.5-kDa form. Both are converted into a 29.5-kDa polypeptide by PNGaseF, indicating that the two forms arise from heterogeneous N-glycosylation. The 31.5-kDa form is sensitive to endoglucosaminidase H, whereas the 32.5-kDa form is resistant (Fig. 5). This indicates that the 31.5-kDa form contains a high mannose type oligosaccharide, whereas the 32.5-kDa form contains a complex type oligosaccharide. MALDI-TOF analysis of the N-glycosylated tryptic peptide 179–192 of secreted pFGE-His confirmed its heterogeneous glycosylation at Asn-191. The oligosaccharide mixture was composed of 11 different species. They all belonged to the hybrid or complex type with up to five N-acetyl-hexosamine, six hexose, one sialic acid, and one fucose residue/oligosaccharide and masses ranging from 1768 to 2424 Da (not shown). pFGE-His purified from the secretions of HT-1080 cells was incubated with elastase or thermolysin at a pFGE/protease ratio of 25:1. Both proteases generated two families of fragments of about 10–12 and 22–24 kDa (Fig. 6). The fragments generated by thermolysin were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The 10–12-kDa fragments represent the amino terminus of mature pFGE starting with residue 27, whereas the 22–24-kDa fragments start with threonine 109 or with valine 115. Phylogenetic sequence conservation analysis has revealed three subdomains in pFGE (Fig. 6, bottom) (Ref. 16Landgrebe J. Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 316: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The proteolytic cleavage sites are located in the linker region between subdomain I and II, which extends from serine 93 to leucine 116. To examine for a possible disulfide bonding of the two cysteine residues in pFGE (at positions 156 and 290), pFGE-His purified from the secretions was first reacted with N-ethylmaleimide, to modify free cysteine residues, and then subjected to reductive carbamidomethylation in the presence of urea to modify disulfide-bonded cysteines. After digestion with trypsin, the peptides were separated by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 matrix and characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The two cysteine-containing tryptic peptides (154–159 and 290–303) were exclusively recovered as carbamidomethylated derivatives, indicating that cysteine 156 and cysteine 290 are disulfide-bonded in pFGE. In fact, when pFGE was subjected to carbamidomethylation in the presence of urea without prior reduction and then digested with trypsin, the two tryptic peptides 154–159 and 290–303 were found to be connected by a disulfide bond. Since non-reduced pFGE migrates in SDS-PAGE as a monomer (not shown), cysteine 156 and 290 form an intramolecular rather than an intermolecular disulfide bond. Localization and Secretion of Endogenous pFGE—Antisera against pFGE-His, purified from the secretions of HT-1080 cells, were generated in rabbits. These antisera were suitable for indirect immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and Western blots. When fibroblasts, fixed with paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with saponin, were reacted with anti-pFGE serum, pFGE was detectable in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it colocalized with protein disulfide isomerase (Fig. 2, D–F). Association with the Golgi, as observed for overexpressed pFGE (Fig. 2, B and C), was not detectable for endogenous pFGE. To follow biosynthesis and secretion of endogenous pFGE, human skin fibroblasts were metabolically labeled for 6 h with [35S]methionine. After labeling, the cells were either harvested or subjected to a 16-h chase in [35S]methionine"

Although iso-CoA was first reported in 1959 (Moffatt, J. G., and Khorana, H. G. (1959) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 81, 1265–1265) to be a by-product of the chemical synthesis of CoA, relatively little attention has been focused on iso-CoA or on acyl-iso-CoA compounds in the literature. We now report structural characterizations of iso-CoA, acetyl-iso-CoA, acetoacetyl-iso-CoA, and β-hydroxybutyryl-iso-CoA using mass spectrometry (MS), tandem MS, and homonuclear and heteronuclear NMR analyses. Although the 2′-phosphate isomer of malonyl-CoA was recently identified in commercial samples, previous characterizations of iso-CoA itself have been based on chromatographic analyses, which ultimately rest on comparisons with the degradation products of CoA and NADPH or have been based on assumptions regarding enzyme specificity. We describe a high performance liquid chromatography methodology for separating the isomers of several CoA-containing compounds. We also report here the first examples of iso-CoA-containing compounds acting as substrates in enzymatic acyl transfer reactions. Finally, we describe a simple synthesis of iso-CoA from CoA, which utilizes β-cyclodextrin to produce iso-CoA with high regioselectivity, and we demonstrate a plausible mechanism that accounts for the existence of iso-CoA isomers in commercial preparations of CoA-containing compounds.

Iso-coenzyme A is an isomer of coenzyme A in which the monophosphate is attached to the 2′-carbon of the ribose ring. Iso-CoA was first reported in 1959 by Moffatt and Khorana (1Moffatt J.G.

Soc. 1961; 83: 663-675Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar) to be a by-product of the chemical synthesis of CoA. The final step of this synthesis entailed acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of cyclic coenzyme A (Scheme 1) to produce a 50:50 mixture of two products that were separated using epicholorohydrin triethanolamine (ECTEOLA) cellulose ion exchange chromatography (1Moffatt J.G.

Direct structural analysis was not readily available in 1959; consequently, the authors deduced the structure of iso-CoA by establishing that, in contrast to CoA, iso-CoA was not a substrate for the enzyme phosphotransacetylase (1Moffatt J.G. Khorana H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1959; 81: 1265Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 2Moffatt J.G. Khorana H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1961; 83: 663-675Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Moffatt and Khorana also used paper chromatography of phosphodiesterase hydrolysates to show that enzymatic hydrolysis of iso-CoA produces adenosine-2′,5′-diphosphate, exclusively (1Moffatt J.G. Khorana H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1959; 81: 1265Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 2Moffatt J.G. Khorana H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1961; 83: 663-675Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Since the original work of Moffatt and Khorana was done, four additional chemical syntheses of CoA have been reported (3Michelson A.M. Biochim. Biophys.

In related work, Retey and co-workers have synthesized several dethia-CoA analogs (10Michenfelder M. Retey J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

Can. J. Chem. 1994; 72: 164-169Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), in which the sulfur of CoA is replaced by a methylene, as mixtures of the 2′- and 3′-phosphate isomers; two of these analogs were purified to homogeneity and characterized by one-dimensional 1H-NMR, 31P-NMR, and, in one case, fast atom bombardment MS (13Brendelberger V.G. Retey J. Isr. J. Chem. 1989; 29: 195-200Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 14Wagner A.P. Retey J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Dethia-CoA analogs were also synthesized and characterized by Stewart and co-workers (16Stewart C.J. Wieland T. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1978; 1: 57-65Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17Ciardelli T.L. Stewart C.J. Seeliger A. Wieland T. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1981; 5: 828-841Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Thorpe C. Ciardelli T.L. Stewart C.J. Wieland T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 118: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); unfortunately, they were unable to separate the 2′- and 3′-phosphate isomers, and the NMR data could only be obtained on isomeric mixtures (17Ciardelli T.L. Stewart C.J. Seeliger A. Wieland T. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1981; 5: 828-841Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, to the best of our knowledge no full structural characterization has ever been reported in the literature for iso-CoA, acetyl-iso-CoA, acetoacetyl-iso-CoA, or β-hydroxybutyryl-iso-CoA. The issue of whether or not enzymes that act upon CoA-containing substrates discriminate between the 2′- and 3′-phosphate isomers is of obvious relevance to the design of new classes of inhibitors and pseudosubstrates. As mentioned above, in the early work of Moffatt and Khorana the enzyme phosphotransacetylase was reported to be unreactive toward iso-CoA (1Moffatt J.G. Khorana H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1959; 81: 1265Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 2Moffatt J.G. Khorana H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1961; 83: 663-675Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Similarly, Retey and co-workers have reported that FAD-dependent isobutanoyl-CoA dehydrogenase is reactive with isobutanoyl-dethia-CoA but not with the iso-CoA analog (13Brendelberger V.G. Retey J. Isr. J. Chem. 1989; 29: 195-200Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and that methylmalonyl-CoA pyruvate carboxylase also distinguishes between the isomers, reacting exclusively with propionyl-dethia-CoA (10Michenfelder M. Retey J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1986; 25: 366-367Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In contrast, Thorpe et al. (18Thorpe C. Ciardelli T.L. Stewart C.J. Wieland T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 118: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) reported that substrate mixtures containing both dethia-iso-CoA and dethia-CoA derivatives are capable of reducing enzyme-bound FAD. Likewise, Rossier (19Rossier J. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) reported that choline acetyltransferase is inhibited by both seleno-CoA and seleno-iso-CoA, and Wagner et al. (14Wagner A.P. Retey J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have reported that N-myristoyltransferase is competitively inhibited by both carbadethia-CoA and carbadethia-iso-CoA, although in both cases the iso-CoA analogs are less potent. In the cases of citrate synthase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (17Ciardelli T.L. Stewart C.J. Seeliger A. Wieland T. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1981; 5: 828-841Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), it is difficult to draw a clear conclusion from the data because the experiments were performed with mixtures containing both the 2′- and 3′-isomers. Clearly this issue needs to be reexamined for many CoA-utilizing enzymes using purified and characterized iso-CoA substrate analogs. Herein we report structural characterizations of iso-CoA, acetyl-iso-CoA, acetoacetyl-iso-CoA, and β-hydroxybutyryl-iso-CoA. Historically, characterizations of the structure of iso-CoA have been based on chromatographic analyses (1Moffatt J.G. Khorana H.G. J. Am. Chem.

We describe HPLC methodology to separate the isomers of several CoA-containing compounds and the characterization of iso-CoA structures using MS, MS/MS, and NMR analyses. We also report here the first examples of iso-CoA-containing compounds acting as substrates in enzymatic acyl transfer reactions. Finally, we describe a simple synthesis of iso-CoA from CoA that utilizes β-cyclodextrin to produce iso-CoA with high regioselectivity, and we demonstrate a plausible mechanism that accounts for the existence of iso-CoA isomers in commercial preparations of CoA-containing compounds. Materials—The lithium salts of CoA (93% purity) purified from yeast, acetyl-CoA (93% purity), β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA (99% purity), the sodium salt of acetoacetyl-CoA (90% purity), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and β-cyclodextrin were purchased from Sigma. Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) was from Molecular Probes. All HPLC or Optima Grade solvents and all other compounds were obtained from Fisher Scientific. HPLC Mass Spectrometry—Commercial CoA and acetyl-CoA standards were analyzed with a Micromass Quattro LC triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI source connected to an Hewlett-Packard series 1100 HPLC system. Resolution of the isomers was achieved with an Agilent Hypersil AA-ODS 2.3 × 200-mm column attached to a Phenomenex SecurityGuard™ (C18, 4-mm length × 3-mm inner diameter), using an isocratic mobile phase of 96% 200 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.0) and 4% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. ESI mass spectra were obtained in the positive ion mode with nitrogen used as the nebulizer and desolvation gas at flow rates of ∼80 and 580 liter/h, respectively. The cone voltage was set to 50 V and the capillary voltage to 3.5 kV. MS/MS using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was performed on the (M + H)+ ions of the isomers of CoA (m/z 768), acetyl-CoA (m/z 810), acetoacetyl-CoA (m/z 852), and β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA (m/z 854) using argon as the collision gas at a collision energy of 20 eV for the collision-induced dissociation of the precursor ion. The commercial standards were monitored at the following transitions: CoA, m/z 768→159, m/z 768→261, and m/z 768→428; acetyl-CoA, m/z 810→303 and m/z 810→428; acetoacetyl-CoA, m/z 852→136, m/z 852→243, m/z 852→261, m/z 852→345, and m/z 852→428; and β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, m/z 854→136, m/z 854→245, m/z 854→347, and m/z 854→428. High Resolution ESI MS of HPLC-purified Samples—Exact mass and MS/MS analyses were performed using HPLC-purified samples of CoA and the isomer on an Applied Biosystems QSTAR XL hybrid quadrupole-time-of-flight LC/MS/MS mass spectrometer. The QSTAR XL was operated in the positive ion mode using a needle voltage of 5500 V. MS analysis was performed over a mass range of m/z 310–1500, and MS/MS spectra of the m/z 768 precursor ion were obtained over the mass range of m/z 50–800. NMR Analyses—NMR spectra of iso-CoA were obtained in D2O in a 5-mm sample tube on a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer at 500.13 mHz for 1H and 202.46 mHz for 31P using an inverse triple resonance probe maintained at 298 K. The COSY experiment was performed using the standard Bruker program cosyprqf with presaturation during the 2-s relaxation delay on the HOD signal, 2048 data points in the F2 dimension, and 128 increments in F1. The data matrix was processed to give a matrix of 1024 × 1024 points, and a sine bell apodization function was applied before Fourier transformation. The parameters for the two-dimensional heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (1H-31P HMQC) experiment were the hmqcqf standard Bruker program, 1.5-s recycle delay, 1024 data points in F2, 128 increments in F1, an 8-Hz coupling constant, GARP (globally optimized alternating phase rectangular pulse) 31P decoupling during acquisition, and shifted sine-squared apodization before Fourier transform. The chemical shift assignments for the HPLC-purified CoA and iso-CoA are labeled above their respective peaks in the proton spectra. The few unlabeled peaks were either due to the iso-CoA disulfide formed during purification and analysis in the absence of reducing agents or to an unknown impurity. Coupling constants were obtained through successive decoupling experiments, and the unresolved coupling constants were then obtained by simulating the spectra using the gNMR (23Rosenfeld S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 8395Crossref Google Scholar) and MestRe-C (24Cobas J.C. Sardina F.J. Concept. Magn. Reson. 2003; 19: 80-96Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar) software packages. HPLC—HPLC analyses of CoA, acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, and the isomers were performed on a Waters LC Module I Plus HPLC system with auto-injection of samples using the Millennium chromatography manager software (Waters, Milford, MA). A Waters NovaPak C18 reverse phase column of 4-μm particle size and 150 × 3.9-mm inner diameter was used with a Phenomenex SecurityGuard™ containing a C18 guard cartridge (4-mm length × 3-mm inner diameter). Isocratic analyses were performed at a wavelength of 261 nm with a mobile phase containing 96% 200 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.0) and 4% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Semi-Prep HPLC purification was performed on an Allsphere ODS-2 semi-prep column, 250 × 10-mm inner diameter, with a Phenomenex SecurityGuard™ containing a C18 guard cartridge (4-mm length × 3-mm inner diameter) using isocratic elution with a mobile phase of 97.5% 200 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.0) and 2.5% acetonitrile at 7 ml/min. Two peaks for each CoA-containing sample were observed with four different reversed phase HPLC columns and three different HPLC systems using both UV-visible and MS detection. HPLC-purified samples of CoA were stable in neutral solution, and iso-CoA was not generated in deionized water at pH 3 or at pH 11 (data not shown). Enzymatic Analyses of Iso-CoA and Acyl-iso-CoA Compounds—The enzymes β-ketothiolase (E.C. 2.3.1.16), acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (E.C. 1.1.1.36), and poly-(β)-hydroxybutyric acid (PHB) synthase (currently not classified), all of which utilize CoA-containing substrates, were examined for the ability to react with the respective iso-CoA-containing analogs. Enzymatic reactions were carried out in a solution of 16 μm acetyl-CoA isomers, 1 mm NADPH, and 5 mm TCEP in 150 mm 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-propanesulfonic acid with a final pH of 7.8 at 37 °C. The first reaction was initiated by addition of β-ketothiolase and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase, and the second reaction was initiated with PHB synthase. Enzyme reactions were quenched with 0.27 m ice-cold perchloric acid followed by centrifugation prior to HPLC analysis as described above. CoA Disulfide (CoASSCoA)—Ten milligrams (13 mm) of HPLC-purified CoA (II) were dissolved in 1 ml of 20 mm ammonium carbonate pH 8.5, reacted overnight at 37 °C, and then lyophilized to produce CoA disulfide with 100% yield by HPLC. The reaction progress was monitored via HPLC using the HPLC procedure described above, except that the mobile phase contained 6% acetonitrile. Cyclic CoA Disulfide—The CoA disulfide lyophile was dissolved in 1 ml of 20 mm MES (pH 6.0), 10 mg (52 mm) of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) was added, and the pH was readjusted. Reaction progress was monitored by HPLC after rapidly reducing an aliquot of the disulfide to the free thiol with TCEP at pH 8.0 for 2 min. When the reaction was complete, the entire mixture was lyophilized. The lyophile was dissolved in 200 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.0) buffer, and the entire solution was applied to a 500-mg Supelco C8 solid phase extraction cartridge that was pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. Residual EDC and the urea by-product were eluted from the cartridge with the equilibration buffer, and the cyclic CoA disulfide was eluted in ∼5 ml of 90% 200 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.0) and 10% acetonitrile. The cyclic CoA-containing fractions were pooled and lyophilized. Regioselective Synthesis of Iso-CoA (III)—The cyclic CoA disulfide lyophile was dissolved in 160 ml of 0.05 mm bicarbonate buffer (I = 0.01), pH 9.5, containing 3 m KCl and 15 mm β-cyclodextrin, and the pH was readjusted. The solution was stirred at 30 °C with the pH maintained at 9.5 for ∼5 days or until the reaction was deemed complete by HPLC, at which point the pH was adjusted to 3.0 to quench the reaction. This provided a final solution of iso-CoA with 83% regioselectivity by HPLC. Acetone precipitation and filtration served to remove some of the KCl and β-cyclodextrin from the iso-CoA-containing solution and permitted rotary evaporation followed by vacuum evaporation to dryness. The final solid was then dissolved in 200 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.0), the pH was readjusted, and the solution was desalted by passing through a 10-g Supelco C8 solid phase extraction cartridge. The desalted isomeric mixture of 83% iso-CoA and 17% CoA was eluted as described previously, and the desalted mixture was lyophilized. Final purification of iso-CoA was performed by dissolving the desalted lyophile in a minimal quantity of 5 mm TCEP in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-propanesulfonic acid (pH 8.0) to reduce the CoA disulfide to the free thiol, passing the mixture through a 10-g solid phase extraction cartridge and eluting with 200 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.0), followed by a final purification using semi-prep HPLC, as described previously. Acid Catalyzed Synthesis of Iso-CoA (III)—HPLC-purified CoA (II) (1.6 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.5 m HCl, and the reaction was monitored by HPLC at room temperature until equilibrium was reached, generating a mixture of 60% CoA and 40% iso-CoA. The identity of iso-CoA produced in this manner was confirmed by NMR analysis after HPLC purification and lyophilization as described previously. Mass Spectrometric Structural Characterization of CoA and Acetyl-CoA Samples—The HPLC-MS and HPLC-MS/MS chromatograms obtained for commercial CoA samples are shown in panel A of Fig. 1. The left portion of panel A in Fig. 1 shows an HPLC-MS chromatogram of a commercial CoA sample that exhibits two peaks with identical (M + H)+ ions at m/z 768, suggesting that commercial CoA samples contain two compounds with identical masses. Therefore, HPLC-MS/MS experiments using MRM were carried out to garner further structural information. It is evident from the right portion of panel A in Fig. 1 that the CoA samples exhibit two peaks for the MRM transitions m/z 768→159, m/z 768→261, and m/z 768→428. Thus, these HPLC-MS and HPLC-MS/MS results suggest the presence of isomeric compounds with identical fragmentation patterns. To confirm these analyses, each peak in the commercial CoA sample was purified by preparative HPLC, and high resolution exact mass and MS/MS analyses were performed individually on each isomer. As shown in the Fig. 1Binsets, the two HPLC-purified samples exhibited identical exact masses (M + H)+ of 768.1264 with an error of 5.09 ppm with respect to the calculated molecular mass. Additionally, the MS/MS (precursor ion m/z 768) spectra for the two HPLC-purified samples depict nearly identical fragmentation patterns that exhibit only minor variations in the relative populations of ions at m/z 136, m/z 159, and m/z 330. These results unequivocally confirm the presence of isomeric forms of CoA in the commercial material, and the MS/MS results showing that these isomers exhibit virtually identical fragmentation patterns indicate that these isomers have extremely similar structures. HPLC-MS and HPLC-MS/MS experiments were also carried out with commercial acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, and β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA (see supplemental material in the on-line version of this article); these experiments also revealed the presence of two isomeric compounds with identical (M + H)+ ions that exhibited identical fragments by HPLC-MS/MS using MRM at the observed transitions. Structural Characterization of Iso-CoA by NMR—One-dimensional 1H-NMR spectra for the two HPLC-purified isomers of CoA are shown in panels A and B of Fig. 2. The spectrum in Fig. 2A for the earlier eluting isomer is very similar to several previously published CoA spectra (25Mieyal J.J. Webster Jr., L.T. Siddiqui U.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 23: 169-181Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast, the spectrum shown in Fig. 2B for the later eluting isomer is very different in the 4–5 ppm region. Therefore, two-dimensional 1H-1H COSY experiments (Fig. 3) were obtained for this isomer in order to assign the chemical shifts. The chemical shift assignments and coupling constants are listed in Table I. It is evident that for the later eluting isomer the 2′-proton is shifted downfield by ∼0.20 ppm, whereas the 3′- and 4′-protons are shifted up field by 0.15 and 0.20 ppm, respectively, and the two 5′-protons have significantly different coupling patterns. Because it seemed likely that the position of the phosphate on the ribose ring gives rise to these differences, 1H-31P HMQC experiments were carried out to explicitly assign the position of each phosphate. As shown in Fig. 4, the 1H-31P HMQC spectra for the later eluting compound unequivocally establishes that the monophosphate is attached at the 2′-carbon, thus designating this compound as iso-CoA. The HPLC experiments presented in Fig. 5 established that commercial samples of CoA, acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, and β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, designated as 93, 93, 90, and 99% pure, respectively, contain ∼10, 15, 18, and 3% of the 2′-monophosphate isomers, respectively.Fig. 31H-1H COSY of Iso-CoA. The 1H-1H COSY of HPLC-purified iso-CoA unequivocally assigns the proton chemical shifts of the ribose ring. The inserted marker lines illustrate how the indicative chemical shift of the anomeric proton, labeled at 6.18 ppm, was used to determine the position of each proton in the ribose ring.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIso-CoA 1H- and 31P-NMR chemical shift assignments and coupling constants1H chemical shiftProton positionIntegrationMultiplicityJ (MHz)8.4181s8.1821s6.181′1dJ1′-2′ (5.15)4.982′1mJ2′-3′ (5.09)J2′-P2′ (8.69)4.563′1tJ3′-4′ (4.56)4.324′1mJ4′-5′a (3.92)J4′-5′b (2.83)J4′-P5′ (2.00)4.185′b1mJ5′b-P5′ (4.58)4.135′a1mJ5′a-P5′ (5.08)J5′a-5′b (11.63)3.923″1s3.731″1ddJ1″-1″ (9.90)J1″-P1″ (5.09)3.481″1ddJ1″-P1″ (4.83)3.385″2tJ5″-6″ (6.53)3.248″2tJ8″-J9″ (6.59)2.549″2t2.376″2t0.8910″3s0.6711″3s31P chemical shiftPhosphate positionIntegrationMultiplicity-0.902′1s-9.631″1d-10.215′1d Open table in a new tab Fig. 41H-31P HMQC of Iso-CoA.

Such adaptation is well exemplified in mammalian cells exposed to nitrogen starvation that are triggered to form and transport autophagosomes to lysosomes, thus constituting an inducible intracellular trafficking pathway. Here we investigated the relationship between the general secretory machinery and the autophagic pathway in Chinese hamster ovary cells grown in the absence of amino acid. Utilizing VSVG-YFP (vesicular stomatitis virus G protein fused to yellow fluorescent protein) and norepinephrine as markers for constitutive and regulated exocytosis, respectively, we found that secretion is attenuated in cells grown in media lacking amino acid. Such decrease in exocytosis stems from partial inhibition of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor ATPase activity, which in turn causes an accumulation of SNARE complexes at both the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane of the starved cells. These findings expose a novel cellular strategy to attenuate secretion of proteins under conditions of limited amino acid supply.

Specific recognition between an intracellular vesicle carrying cargo molecules and its appropriate target membrane involves the interaction between v-SNAREs, 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptor; SNAP, soluble NSF attachment protein; v-SNARE, vesicle-associated SNARE; t-SNARE, target membrane SNARE; VSVG, vesicular stomatitis virus G protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; GATE-16, Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer, 16 kDa; PM, plasma membrane; NE, norepinephrine; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; FCS, fetal calf serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; α-MEM, minimum essential medium; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. integral membrane proteins located on the vesicle, and t-SNAREs, located at the target membrane (1Bonifacino J.S. Glick B.S. Cell. 2004; 116: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). These interactions form a SNARE “core complex,” which consists of four entwined α-helix bundles of typically three Q-SNARE helices and one R-SNARE helix, a classification based on conserved glutamine or arginine residues at the center of their SNARE-binding domain. The SNARE core complex is stabilized mainly by hydrophobic interactions between the four helices and by a central ionic layer consisting of one arginine and three glutamine residues contributed by each of the four α-helices (2Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). Formation of transcomplexes of SNAREs from opposing membranes yields a close, stable proximity between the two membranes, which facilitates overcoming the energy barrier required for membrane fusion (3Weber T.

Furthermore, using three sets of functionally identified yeast t-SNAREs to mediate the fusion of ER-derived transport vesicles with the Golgi, the homotypic fusion of vacuoles, and the fusion with the plasma membrane (PM), it was demonstrated that isolated SNARE proteins encode compartmental specificity and mediate the actual fusion event (6McNew J.A.

Additional proteins are required for targeting and tethering of these transport vesicles with their specific targets (9Waters M.G. Hughson F.M. Traffic. 2000; 1: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The hexameric ATPase N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) utilizes ATP hydrolysis to dissociate cis-SNARE complexes after membrane fusion, allowing the individual SNARE proteins to be recycled for subsequent rounds of fusion (10Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 11Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). Whereas specific v- and t-SNAREs are associated with each intercompartmental transport step, NSF is a general cytosolic factor that can disassemble SNARE complexes from most intracellular transport steps. The ATPase activity of NSF is enhanced by α-SNAP (soluble NSF attachment protein), which mediates NSF binding to different SNARE complexes (12Whiteheart S.W. Schraw T. Matveeva E.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 207: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and possibly by other factors such as GATE-16 (13Muller J.M. Shorter J. Newman R. Deinhardt K. Sagiv Y. Elazar Z. Warren G.

Notably, evidence for direct negative regulation of NSF activity in vivo has been suggested by Matsushita et al. (16Matsushita K. Morrell C.N. Cambien B. Yang S.X. Yamakuchi M. Bao C. Hara M.R. Quick R.A. Cao W. O'Rourke B. Lowenstein J.M. Pevsner J. Wagner D.D. Lowenstein C.J. Cell. 2003; 115: 139-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), whereby S-nitrosylation of specific cysteine residues on NSF leads to attenuation of triggered exocytosis of endothelial granules. However, it is not known yet whether NSF S-nitrosylation controls other cellular membrane fusion processes such as constitutive exocytosis or vesicular transport along the secretory pathway. Direct regulation of vesicular trafficking is crucial not only for the spatially and temporally controlled secretion of bioactive molecules but also for controlling the levels of various molecules (e.g. receptors, transporters) on the PM (17Grusovin J. Macaulay S.L. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: 620-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A variety of regulatory events that operate at different steps of vesicular transport control the trafficking along specific cellular pathways in response to different signals. Developmental, environmental, and cell cycle-related signals have differential effects on different vesicular transport pathways. For example, transport along the secretory pathway in Xenopus oocytes is blocked between the trans-Golgi and the PM during meiotic maturation (18Leaf D.S. Roberts S.J. Gerhart J.C. Moore H.P. Dev. Biol. 1990; 141: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). On the other hand, transport of special vesicles to lysosomes is enhanced upon amino acid deprivation in a process known as autophagy (19Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Autophagy is a bulk protein degradation process in which newly formed double membrane vesicles, termed autophagosomes, deliver cytoplasmic contents and organelles for lysosomal degradation (19Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). There are at least three types of autophagy: macroautophagy (referred to as autophagy hereafter), microautophagy (20Kunz J.B. Schwarz H. Mayer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9987-9996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and chaperon-mediated autophagy (21Cuervo A.M. Gomes A.V. Barnes J.A. Dice J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33329-33335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Autophagy, a relatively understudied membrane-trafficking process, may be regarded as a unique vesicular transport pathway that is triggered in response to stress conditions such as nitrogen starvation (19Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar).

In the present study we have investigated whether deprivation of amino acid also affects other vesicular transport pathways such as constitutive and regulated secretion. By comparing exocytosis in starved versus non-starved control cells, we conclude that the Golgi to PM transport is significantly attenuated under amino acid starvation conditions. Structural and functional assays suggest that this attenuation is directly caused by inhibition of NSF ATPase activity during starvation. Our data provide, for the first time, a molecular explanation for the attenuation of exocytosis under these physiological stress conditions. Cell Culture and Induction of Amino Acid Starvation—CHO cells were grown in α-MEM containing 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, either on plates or in suspension. PC12 cells were grown in DMEM containing 6% FCS, 6% horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. To induce autophagy by amino acid deprivation, cells were washed three times with Earl's balanced salt solution (EBSS) and then incubated in EBSS (supplemented with vitamins and pyruvate to the same concentrations present in the rich media) for the indicated time periods at 37 °C. As a control, washed cells were incubated with α-MEM or DMEM in the absence of FCS for the indicated starvation periods. Degradation and Secretion Assays—Measurement of long-lived protein degradation in CHO cells was based on an assay previously described by Ogier et al. (27Ogier-Denis E. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO cells plated on 6-well plates were prelabeled with [14C]valine (Amersham Biosciences) for 24 h. Cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then preincubated for 1 h in either α-MEM or EBSS, both containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm cold valine. After 1 h of incubation, the culture media were replaced with identical fresh media, and the cells were incubated for an additional 2 or 4 h. The media were collected and centrifuged for 3 min at 2200 rpm, and the supernatant was precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid. Total cells radioactivity was measured after lysing the cells in 0.1 m NaOH. Degradation and secretion of prelabeled proteins were measured as the ratio between the radioactivity found in the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction (free [14C]valine released to the medium) or in the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction (incorporated [14C]valine released to the medium) and the total cells radioactivity, respectively. VSVG Trafficking—CHO cells cultured in Lab-Tek chambered coverglass system (Nunc) were transfected at 40 °C with VSVG tsO45-YFP (45Nichols B.J. Kenworthy A.K. Polishchuk R.S. Lodge R. Roberts T.H. Hirschberg K. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) by Lipofectamine according to manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h of incubation, cells were washed three times with prewarmed EBSS and further incubated at 40 °C for 3 h in control or starvation media. Cells were then shifted to 32 °C to trigger transport at t = 0. A series of fluorescent microscopy images was made at the time points indicated. To analyze the progression of VSVG along the secretory pathway under favorable versus starvation conditions, cells were scored as showing Golgi localization of VSVG when the Golgi staining intensity was at least strong as that of the ER. Cells were scored as showing PM localization of VSVG in this analysis when PM staining was clearly visualized. Representatives for each case are shown in Fig. 2. Norepinephrine Release Assay—PC12 cells were grown in poly-l-lysine-coated 6-well plate for 2–3 days until they reached 50–70% confluence. Cells were loaded at 37 °C for 16 h in DMEM containing 6% FCS, 6% horse serum and 1.5 μCi of [3H]NE (ARC Inc.)/well, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then chased in control or starvation medium for additional 3.5 h. To prevent spontaneous leakage of [3H]norepinephrine (NE) from starved cells resulting from decreased ATP cellular level, extra glucose was added to the EBSS medium to the same level found in DMEM. PC12 cells were then incubated in low K+ medium (10 mm Hepes, 5 mm KCl, 145 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) for 10 min at 37 °C prior to the induction of secretion with high K+ medium (10 mm Hepes, 55 mm KCl, 95 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4). [3H]NE release was assessed in time course experiments in which the medium was collected and replaced every 2 min. Media samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min, and supernatant radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. At the end of the experiment, the cells were solubilized in 1 ml of 0.25 n NaOH, and the lysates were carefully collected. [3H]NE release was calculated as the ratio between the medium radioactivity and the total cells radioactivity (sum of all media counts and the radioactivity remaining in the cells at the end of the experiment). Preparation of Cytosol and Membrane Extracts—Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then twice in a homogenization buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 50 mm KCl. The cells were then homogenized in the same buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μm pepstatin A using a Balch homogenizer (for cells grown in suspension) or Dounce homogenizer (for cells grown on plates). The homogenates were centrifuged for 5 min at 2500 rpm, and the supernatant was further centrifuged for 30 min at 200,000 × g. The supernatant containing the cytosol was collected. The pellet, containing total membranes, was resuspended in extraction buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 20 mm KCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100. To obtain cytosol and membrane extracts in the presence of ATP, CHO cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, then twice in a homogenization buffer containing 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 m KCl, and homogenized and fractionated as described above. SNARE Complex Disassembly Assays—To compare SNARE complex levels in control versus starved cells, membrane extracts from CHO or PC12 cells were incubated in SDS-sample buffer at either 30 °C or 100 °C for 5 min and then subjected to immunoblotting. To examine the capacity of cytosolic fractions to dissociate SNARE complexes, rat brain membranes containing SNARE complexes were pretreated on ice with 1 mmN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) for 10 min followed by treatment with 2 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min. NEM-treated membranes were incubated with 50 μg of cytosol obtained from control or starved CHO cells in a reaction buffer containing 0.5 μg of α-SNAP, 0.5 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, and ATP regeneration buffer at 30 °C for 30 min. In the indicated reactions, 1.2 μg of recombinant NSF was added to the disassembly assay. The membranes were then isolated by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C), resuspended in SDS-sample buffer, and processed for immunoblotting without prior boiling unless mentioned. Proteolytic Digestion—Recombinant NSF proteins and cytosolic fractions obtained from starved or non-starved CHO cells were incubated at 30 °C with trypsin (ratio of 1:20 and 1:200 trypsin/protein (w/w), respectively). Progress of the proteolysis was assessed by removing aliquots at the indicated time points and quenching the digestion with a 5:1 (w/w) excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor over trypsin. The aliquots were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using a mixture of 2E5, 2C8, and 6E6 anti-NSF monoclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitation—Monoclonal antibodies (anti-NSF) and polyclonal antibodies (anti-Gos-28 or anti-syntaxin-5) were covalently coupled by dimethyl pimelimidate (Sigma) to protein G- and protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. The coupled antibodies were then incubated with either recombinant His-NSF-Myc protein (0.5 μg) or cytosolic (200 μg) and membrane extract fractions (200 μg) obtained from control or starved cells for at least 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times in phosphate-buffered saline, the bound material was eluted by 2% SDS at 95 °C, and the eluates were subjected to Western blot analysis. In some experiments, recombinant His-NSF-Myc fractions (0.5 μg) were preincubated with cytosolic fractions (50 μg) obtained from control or starved CHO cells at 30 °C for 30 min prior to the immunoprecipitation. ATPase Activity Assay—Prior to the ATPase activity assay, NSF (6 μg) was preincubated with cytosolic fractions (40 μg) obtained from control or starved CHO cells at 30 °C for 20 min in a total volume of 100 μlof25mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm ATP. The assay was initiated by adding residual amounts of [γ-32P]ATP (0.25 μCi/sample), carried out for 30 min at 30 °C, and stopped by adding 100 μl of ice-cold perchloric acid to a final concentration of 10%. Nucleotides were bound to 500 μl of ice-cold charcoal, and samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants containing released 32Pi were quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Background activities of control and starved cytosol alone were subtracted (0.08 and 0.079 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/h for cytosolic fractions obtained from control or starved cells, respectively). Secretion Is Inhibited in Response to Amino Acid Deprivation—Autophagy triggered by starvation may be regarded as a special case of membrane-trafficking process that shares some of the components utilized by other intracellular membrane-trafficking pathways. In an attempt to study the relationship between the autophagic and the secretory pathways, we utilized [14C]valine-prelabeled tissue culture cells to examine the effects of amino acid starvation on intracellular protein degradation and simultaneously on protein secretion. In this system the autophagic activity was determined by monitoring the bulk protein degradation of long-lived proteins (27Ogier-Denis E. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), whereas exocytosis was determined by monitoring the release of secreted proteins from the cells. For this purpose, prelabeled CHO cells were incubated for different time periods in either α-MEM (without FCS) or EBSS (starvation medium), and the levels of secreted labeled proteins and amino acid into the media were determined. As depicted in Fig. 1A, bulk degradation of long-lived proteins, measured by the release of trichloroacetic acidsoluble [14C]valine from the cells, was about 50% higher in cells incubated in medium lacking amino acid compared with control medium, indicating significant enhancement of autophagy in starved cells. Concomitantly, the radioactivity measured in the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble pellet was significantly reduced (∼30%) in cells deprived of amino acid (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained when CHO cells were prelabeled with [35S]methionine, as well as in different cell lines such as COS-7 and PC12 cells that were treated similarly (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that during amino acid starvation protein degradation is stimulated, whereas the constitutive secretion of newly synthesized proteins is largely inhibited. Vesicular Transport to the Plasma Membrane Is Inhibited during Starvation—To identify the step along the secretory pathway that is most affected by amino acid starvation, we utilized the well studied vesicular stomatitis virus ts045 G protein fused to yellow fluorescent protein (VSVG-YFP) to monitor trafficking through the various compartments of the secretory pathway in living cells. We took advantage of the fact that at 40 °C the ts045 VSVG mutant protein is retained within the ER, whereas upon a shift to 32 °C it moves as a synchronous population to the Golgi complex before being transported to the PM (28Presley J.F. Smith C. Hirschberg K. Miller C. Cole N.B. Zaal K.J.M. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Hence, CHO cells were transfected with VSVG-YFP, incubated in normal or starvation medium for 3 h at 40 °C, and then shifted to 32 °C to trigger transport. The transport of the VSVG-YFP ts045 protein was monitored by confocal microscopy. At each of several selected time points, the percentage of cells in which the VSVG-YFP protein was localized to the ER, Golgi, or the PM was calculated. As shown in Fig. 2, the VSVG protein accumulated in the Golgi apparatus in about 60% of the control cells within a 5-min incubation period at 32 °C and in 100% of these cells within 20 min. During this period, no significant difference in the rate of transport of VSVG protein from the ER to the Golgi was detected in the starved cells. However, within 60 min the VSVG protein was detected in the PM of more than 60% of the control cells, whereas only 25% of the starved cells exhibited PM labeling. From this analysis we conclude that although ER-to-Golgi transport is only marginally affected by amino acid starvation, the transport from the Golgi apparatus to the PM is significantly attenuated in starved cells. The effect of amino acid deprivation on exocytosis was studied further in PC12 cells, a rat adrenal phaeochromocytoma cell line, which expresses several well defined neuronal properties in culture, including the regulated secretion of neurotransmitters. To examine the effects of amino acid starvation on exocytosis in this cell line, release of [3H]norepinephrine from prelabeled cells was measured in control versus starved cells. Hence, prelabeled cells were incubated for 3.5 h in either DMEM or EBSS supplemented with glucose (starvation media) and then subjected to time course secretion analysis. As depicted in Fig. 3, the basal rates of NE release were low and similar for both control and starved cells. However, when NE secretion was stimulated by directly depolarizing the PC12 cells with elevated extracellular K+ ions (55 mm KCl), 14% of the [3H]NE content was secreted within the first 2 min and cumulatively up to 31% within 12 min. Under these conditions, however, secretion of NE from the starved cells was inhibited by about 32%, indicating that triggered exocytosis too is sensitive to amino acid starvation. Disassembly of SNARE Complexes Is Inhibited during Amino Acid Starvation—A normal vesicular transport cycle requires rapid and regulated disassembly of SNARE complexes, mediated by the ATPase activity of NSF and its co-factor α-SNAP (reviewed in Ref. 29May A.P. Whiteheart S.W. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21991-21994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Exocytosis in PC12 cells, for example, requires the formation and subsequent dissociation of a specific SNARE complex, including the vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) and the PM proteins syntaxin and SNAP-25. To examine whether lack of amino acid affected the dissociation of these complexes, we relied on the fact that SNARE complexes are SDS-resistant at 37 °C and thus can be detected as high molecular weight complexes by immunoblotting (30Hayashi T. Yamasaki S. Nauenburg S. Binz T. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, the level of SNARE complexes found in the starved cells was much higher than in the control cells, indicating that disassembly of SNARE complexes involved in exocytosis is inhibited under amino acid starvation conditions. To further examine the effect of amino acid deprivation on the oligomeric state of SNARE molecules, we isolated membrane extracts from control and starved CHO cells and analyzed the oligomeric states of GOS-28, a v-SNARE participating in intra-Golgi transport, and its cognate t-SNARE, syntaxin-5. Consistent with the results obtained with the PC12 cells (Fig. 4A), we observed significantly more GOS-28/syntaxin-5 SDS-resistant complexes in the starved cells (Fig. 4B), indicating that the disassembly of SNARE complexes containing GOS-28 and syntaxin-5 was impaired under these conditions. The effect of starvation on the interaction between GOS-28 and syntaxin-5 was further analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. For this purpose, agarose-protein A beads coupled to anti-syntaxin-5 or anti-GOS-28 antibodies, as indicated, were mixed with membrane extracts obtained from control or starved CHO cells, and the eluted material was subjected to Western blot analysis. The results presented in Fig. 4C demonstrate that the interaction between GOS-28 and syntaxin-5 in a complex containing NSF is increased during starvation. NSF Activity Is Inhibited in Starved Cells—The accumulation of different SNARE complexes in the starved cells may best be explained by a reduction in NSF activity. To test this hypothesis, we determined the ability of cytosolic fractions obtained from control or starved cells to dissociate endogenous SNARE complexes. Rat brain membranes were first treated with NEM to abolish intrinsic NSF activity. Next, the treated membranes were incubated with cytosol obtained from starved or control CHO cells, and the level of SNARE complexes was analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5, incubation of NEM-treated membranes with cytosol obtained from control cells resulted in a significant dissociation of high molecular weight SNARE complexes detected in this system. In contrast, no substantial dissociation of SNARE complexes was observed upon incubation with cytosol obtained from starved cells, suggesting that NSF activity was inhibited in this fraction. Moreover, the addition of recombinant NSF to the starved cytosol recovered most of the SNARE complex disassembly activity of this fraction, indicating that the inhibition of NSF in starved cells led to the accumulation of SNARE complexes in these cells. Notably, the recovery of the disassembly activity was not complete as compared with the disassembly activity found in the control cytosol, suggesting partial inactivation of the recombinant NSF proteins by the starved cytosolic fraction (see below). NSF Undergoes a Conformational Change in Response to Starvation—NSF is a homohexamer in which each of the protomers consists of three domains: an N-terminal domain, NSF-N, which is responsible for the interaction with the α-SNAP-SNARE complex, and two homologous ATP-binding domains, NSF-D1 and NSF-D2 (31Nagiec E.E.

Although their kinetics and cell surface expression are regulated by auxiliary subunits, little is known about the proteins that may interact with Kv4 during development. A yeast two-hybrid screening of a cDNA library made from the sensory epithelium of embryonic chick cochlea revealed a novel association of Kv4.2 with a protein containing a pentraxin domain (PPTX). Sequence analysis shows that PPTX is a member of the long pentraxin family, is 53% identical to mouse PTX3, and has a signal peptide at the N terminus. Studies with chick cochlear tissues reveal that Kv4.2 coprecipitates PPTX and that both proteins are colocalized to the sensory and ganglion cells. A yeast two-hybrid assay demonstrated that the last 22 amino acids of the PPTX C terminus interact with the N terminus of Kv4.2. Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with recombinant PPTX reveal secretory products in both non-truncated and truncated forms. Among the secreted variants are several blocked by Brefeldin A, suggesting export via a classical pathway. PPTX is soluble in the presence of sodium carbonate, suggesting localization to the cytosolic side of the plasmalemma. Immunohistochemical studies show that Kv4.2 and PPTX colocalize in the region of the plasmalemma of Chinese hamster ovary cells; however, both are locked in the endoplasmic reticulum of COS-7 cells, suggesting that PPTX does not act as a shuttle protein.

Ion channels define the excitatory characteristics of sensory and neuronal cells. The A-type transient K+ channel has a role in this regulation by governing the frequency and amplitude of action potentials (1Connor J.A. Stevens C.F. J.

Several genes contribute to the diversity of this α-subunit, including members of the Shaker and Shal subfamilies (4Salkoff L. Baker K. Butler A. Covarrubias M. Pak M.D. Wei A. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 161-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Additionally, auxiliary subunits increase diversity by dramatically changing the function and expression of the α-subunits. For example, Kvβ accessory proteins can confer properties of inactivation to Shaker α-subunits that are non-inactivating (5Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O.

Other accessory subunits such as KChIP, frequenin, DPPX, MiRP, and MinK can alter the biophysical properties of Shal-subfamily members, Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 (8Kuryshev Y.A. Gudz T.I. Brown A.M.

Thus, the association of these subunits is significant to both channel expression and the generation of normal electrical signals. The pentraxins belong to a superfamily of proteins that include laminin-G and thrombospondins (14Beckmann G. Hanke J. Bork P. Reich J.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, they are secretory proteins that can be divided into the classical “short” pentraxins and the more recently discovered “long” pentraxins (for review see Ref. 15Goodman A.R. Cardozo T. Abagyan R. Altmeyer A. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The short pentraxins (∼25 kDa) were described first in the 1930s, resulting in a large body of literature that includes C-reactive protein and serum amyloid P. The genes that encode these proteins are turned on in response to trauma and infection and are regulated by interleukin-1 and -6, tumor necrosis factor, and glucocorticoids. Recently, members of the short pentraxins were found in Limulus, suggesting that both members were present in common ancestors of arthropods and chordates (16Shrive A.K. Metcalfe A.M. Cartwright J.R. Greenhough T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 997-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The long pentraxins (∼50 kDa) include members such as the neuronal pentraxins (NP1, NP2, NPR), apexin (a protein associated with sperm-egg fusion), and tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-14. An additional member is PTX3, which differs from tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-14 by one amino acid (aa) 1The abbreviations used are: aa, amino acid; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HA, hemagglutinin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid. and which was cloned from human vascular endothelial cells (15Goodman A.R.

Potassium channels in the auditory and vestibular system play a central role in processing stimuli at the level of the receptor or hair cell. Their acquisition during development regulates the onset of hearing sensitivity, as was demonstrated with the calcium-activated K+ channel (17Fuchs P.A. Sokolowski B.H. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Kros C.J. Ruppersberg J.P. Rüsch A. Nature. 1998; 394: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, channel expression can vary depending on hair cell type and location on the sensory epithelium. Recently, we identified an arachidonic acid-sensitive, A-type channel in the cochlea of chicken (19Sokolowski B.H.A. Sakai Y. Harvey M.C. Duzhyy D.E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6265-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that belongs to the Shal subfamily. This Kv4.2 channel is localized to hair cells that are innervated exclusively by large calyceal efferents (20Fischer F.P. Hear. Res. 1992; 61: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which hyperpolarize the receptor cell (21Fuchs P.A. Murrow B.W. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 800-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This negative change in membrane potential recruits a greater number of A-type channels, which can thus shape the excitatory response to a depolarizing stimulus (19Sokolowski B.H.A. Sakai Y. Harvey M.C. Duzhyy D.E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6265-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The acquisition of this channel occurs early in development, but little is know about the mechanisms that regulate its expression. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screening of an embryonic cDNA library, to begin defining proteins that interact with the A-type channel during development. Here, we localize and describe the characteristics of one such polypeptide, a pentraxin-like protein that interacts with Kv4.2 and has secretory characteristics. Plasmid Construction and Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—A plasmid (pBD-N) containing the sequence for the N terminus (aa 2–179) of chick Kv4.2 (accession number AF075160) in fusion with the GAL4 binding domain (BD), was constructed by inserting a PCR-amplified DNA fragment into the vector pBD-GAL4 Cam (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), using the primers 5′-CTAGAATTCGCAGCGGGCGTACCAGCTTGGTTA-3′ and 3′-CTAGTCGACTTTAGTGTGGGTTTTCAAAGGCCCGCCACAT-5′. Using the pBD-N construct as “bait,” protein-protein interactions with Kv4.2 were determined by using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a cDNA library made from cochlear sensory epithelium of embryonic day 14–19 Gallus gallus. The library was constructed by cloning cDNA fragments into ZAPII by EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites (Stratagene). Yeast AH109 cells (Clontech) were transformed sequentially with the bait construct and the cDNA library using the lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier DNA/polyethylene glycol method (22Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2077) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on SD-His-Leu-Ade-Trp (SD-HLAT) medium (BIO 101 Systems, Qbiogene, Irvine CA), and positive colonies were selected and analyzed. Once cDNA fragments coding for PPTX were obtained, the 5′-end was determined by PCR, using the pAD-plasmid library as a template and the primers 5′-CGCGTTTGGAATCACTACAGGGA-3′ and 3′-TCGTCGCCTTCATCCAGCACGGAA-5′, which have annealing sites within the vector and the partially known PPTX cDNA sequence. To determine the importance of the N terminus in the PPTX-Kv4.2 interaction, deletion variants of the N terminus of PPTX (pAD-N1, pAD-N2, and pAD-N3) were used in a yeast two-hybrid assay, using the N and C termini of Kv4.2 as bait. The three PPTX variants of the N terminus were obtained from screenings of the cDNA library and contained fragments that had deletions of aa 1–14, 1–139, and 131–154 of PPTX, respectively. To verify the importance of the PPTX C terminus, deletions of this end (pAD-C1, pAD-C2, and pAD-C3) were obtained by using pAD-N1 and deleting aa 214–433, 321–433, and 412–433 using restriction endonucleases BglII, BamHI-XbaI, and SmaI-XbaI, respectively. Expression constructs for full-length PPTX and mutated recombinants were made by inserting the PPTX coding region into the vector pCMS-EGFP (Clontech). These constructs were used to characterize PPTX in CHO and COS-7 cells. To make insertions possible and to increase protein expression, PPTX cDNA was amplified with a forward primer coding for the XhoI site and a consensus Kozak sequence upstream of an ATG start codon and a reverse primer containing an XbaI site. The pAD-plasmid library or plasmid pAD-N1 served as a template. PCR was accomplished using high-fidelity Tgo DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). DNA fragments were gel-purified, digested with a mixture of XhoI and XbaI, and ligated with the vector. PCR was performed on a PTC-200 thermocycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA) under the following conditions: 94 °C for 2 min, 35–38 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min, and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 7 min. The plasmid pCMS-PPTX, which expressed full-length PPTX, was constructed using PCR with the pAD-plasmid library as a template and the primers 5′-ACTACTCGAGCCACCATGCTGCCTGGAGTGCTTT-3′ and 3′-ACTATCTAGATTAAGAAACATACTGAGCTCCTCCATA-5′. The plasmid pCMS-PPTXmut1-NF, containing the coding sequence for PPTX with a mutation of aa 6–20 that consisted of a deletion of aa 6–9 and a substitution (AQYVSDYKDDDDK), which included a FLAG tag (Sigma). The plasmid was constructed by first generating a PCR fragment using pADP-N1 as a template with primers 5′-CTACAAGGACGATGACGACAAGTCCGTGCTGGATGAAGGCGACGA-3′ and 3′-ACTATCTAGATTAAGAAACATACTGAGCTCCTCCATA-5′. The fragment was gel-purified and amplified again with primers 5′-ACTACTCGAGCCACCATGCTGCCTGGAGTGCTTT-3′ and 3′-ACTATCTAGATTAAGAAACATACTGAGCTCCTCCATA-5′. A PCR-generated fragment with two copies of hemagglutinin (HA) on the C terminus of Kv4.2 was inserted into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) by exchanging a fragment, coding for EcoRI-XhoI on the C terminus. The fragment was generated with cKv4.2 as a template and primers 5′-CTACTCGAGCAACTTCAGCCGTATCTACCACCAG-3′ and 3′-ACTACTCGAGTTAGGCATAATCCGGTACATCATAAGGGTAGGCATAATCCGGTACATCATAAGGGTATAAAGCGGATACTCTGACAATGTT-5′. Transfections, Coimmunoprecipitations, and Western Blotting—CHO cell cultures were transfected with plasmid DNA (6 μg) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). For cotransfections, plasmids were used in a 1:1 ratio. After 5 h of incubation, transfection medium was replaced with fresh medium, and cells were incubated for 30–34 h. In experiments examining the mode of secretory transport, Brefeldin A, an inhibitor of a classical secretory pathway, was added to cell cultures at a concentration of 5–10 μg/ml. Cells were lysed by pipetting and then sonicating on ice in Tris buffer with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% SDS containing protease inhibitors. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended for fractionation studies in either 100 mm Na2CO3, pH 10, or STE buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) with protease inhibitors. Homogenates were triturated, spun at 1000 × g for 5 min, and pellets (P1 fractions) were resuspended in STE buffer. The supernatants (S1 fractions) were spun at 20,800 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (S2 fractions) were collected, and pellets (P2 fractions) were resuspended in STE buffer. All fractions were solubilized in equal volumes of Laemmli sample buffer with 5% β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. Lysates were cleared for coimmunoprecipitation by centrifugation at 20,800 × g for 30 min and incubated at 4 °C for 6 h with antibody-bound rec-protein G-Sepharose 4B beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) (7.5 μg of anti-FLAG M2 mAb, Sigma, or 2 μg of anti-HA pAb, Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Beads were washed with lysis buffer, then MOPS buffer plus 0.2% Triton X-100. Samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE under denaturing, reducing conditions. Conditioned medium was spun for 20 min at 3000 × g and used for immunoprecipitation of secreted FLAG-tagged PPTX variants. Supernatant (1 ml) was combined with protease inhibitors, and beads that were preincubated with 5 μg of anti-FLAG antibody. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C and then prepared for SDS-PAGE analysis. All samples were run in 10% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) under denaturing conditions. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and blocked in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Western blots were probed with anti-FLAG M2 mAb (1:1000), anti-HA pAb (1:4000), or anti-HA mAb (1:5000) (Sigma). Blots were developed using ECL and photographed using Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry analysis was done using Spot Denso software on a ChemiImager 5500 (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Coimmunoprecipitation of PPTX and Kv4.2 using lysates of cochlear tissue were carried out as described previously (23Sokolowski B.H.A. Harvey M.C. Venkataramu C. Duzhyy D.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—Sensory and ganglion cells of the chick cochlea were prepared for immunostaining as described previously when using either immunofluorescence or horseradish peroxidase (19Sokolowski B.H.A. Sakai Y. Harvey M.C. Duzhyy D.E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6265-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The antibody used for these experiments consisted of an anti-PTX3 polyclonal (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) raised against the entire length of human PTX3 (24Battazii B. Vouret-Craviari V. Bastone A. De Gioia L. Matteucci C. Peri G. Spreafico F. Pausa M. D'Ettorre C. Gianazza E. Tagliabue A. Salmona M. Tedesco F. Introna M. Mantovani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32817-32823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Comparisons of chick N- and C-terminal ends with human PTX3 reveals an identity of 41 and 67%, respectively. Western blot analysis showed that this antibody identified a polypeptide of similar weight to FLAG-tagged PPTX in CHO cells transfected with recombinant PPTX (data not shown). The anti-Kv4.2 monoclonal antibody was raised against aa residues 209–225 of rat Kv4.2 (AAB19939). Comparison of the chick sequence (AAL56633) with that of rat shows that chick Kv4.2 has two additional amino acids between aa 458 and 459 of rat and a substitution of glutamine for proline at aa 464 of rat. Immunohistochemical preparation of CHO and COS-7 cells transfected with recombinants was carried out as follows. Cells were cultured on coverslips in 10-cm2 culture dishes. CHO cells were transfected with pCMS-PPTXmut1-FL and pcDNA3.1(+):Kv4.2HA using Lipofectamine and incubated as above. COS cells were transfected with 1 μg each of pCMS-PPTXmut1-FL and pcDNA3.1(+):Kv4.2HA with 6 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), incubated for 12 h in 2 ml of medium, and cultured in fresh medium for 24–36 h. Cells were washed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked in 10% fetal bovine serum, and incubated with primary Ab. Protein expression was detected with anti-FLAG M2 mAb (1:250) and/or anti-HA pAb (1:500), using goat anti-mouse Texas Red-X (1:150) or goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1:300, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). RT-PCR—Cochlear ducts, blood vessels, brain, heart, aorta, and eye were excised from an adult chicken and homogenized in Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) to obtain total RNA. Cells were processed for RT-PCR as described previously (19Sokolowski B.H.A. Sakai Y. Harvey M.C. Duzhyy D.E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6265-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Primers used to generate PPTX products were 5′-ACTACTCGAGCCACCATGCTGCCTGGAGGAGTGCTTT-3′ and 3′-CTAGAATTCGAGGTACAGCTGGATCTCATAGG-5′. Chick β-actin served as a positive control with primers 5′-TGGATGATGATATTGCTGCG-3′ and 3′-CTCCATATCATCCCAGTGG-5′. Reactions performed without reverse transcriptase served as a negative control. Total RNA in a quantity equivalent to one cochlea was used in a 20-μl reverse transcriptase reaction at 58 °C for 1 h. Reactions were performed for one cycle at 94 °C for 2 min, 28–40 cycles at 94 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 7 min. Putative Structure—Yeast two-hybrid screening of ∼1.5 × 106 pAD-library clones resulted in positive clones selected on SD-HLAT medium. The pAD-library plasmids were isolated from selected clones, amplified in Escherichia coli strain XL1, and retransformed back to yeast cells containing the vector, pBD-GAL4 Cam, or the plasmid pBD-N, that expressed the N-terminal end of Kv4.2 in fusion with a GAL4 binding domain. Plasmids supporting the growth of yeast cells on an SD-HLAT medium in the presence of the pBD-N plasmid, but not in the presence of the pBD-GAL4 Cam vector, were used as templates for cDNA sequencing. Sequences obtained from the 5′-end of these isolates revealed a protein with a pentraxin domain (PPTX). PCR was used to amplify the longest part of the PPTX cDNA region located next to the pAD-vector sequence, because there was a possibility that the N-terminal sequence was incomplete in these isolated clones. One of the primers in this PCR had an annealing site within the pAD-vector sequence, whereas another primer had an annealing site within a previously determined part of the PPTX cDNA. The sequence of the longest isolated PCR fragment revealed an additional 5′-end coding sequence for PPTX. Of 40 clones isolated, 38 were matched 100% to the PPTX sequence (Fig. 1), whereas two coded for a PPTX isoform with a deletion of aa 130–155. Sequences obtained from RT-PCR products of cochlea, eye, brain, heart, and blood vessels of an adult chicken confirmed the expression of the longer RNA isoform in all tissues (Fig. 2). Primers were designed for RT-PCR by comparing the alignment data between PPTX and PTX3 (accession number AAH22176) and the intron-exon structure of PTX3, so that the amplified region would include parts of the potential first and third exons. This design would identify different splice variants of PPTX RNA; however, no such variants were determined by RT-PCR, which confirms the longer isoform as the major isoform. Computer analysis (Top Pred2) predicted two transmembrane regions in the primary structure of PPTX. One region, located at the very N-terminal end, is recognized as a signal peptide (SignalP 3.0), whereas the other divides PPTX into two unequal parts. The N terminus (residues 1–245) contains a coiled coil structure that has a 39% sequence identity to the mouse homolog of PTX3. Sequence identity between PPTX and PTX3 is distributed unevenly in the N terminus. Two blocks of the PPTX aa sequence (31–40 and 61–74) are preserved in PTX3, whereas the first 82 aa are 58% identical. The C terminus (residues 265–433) of PPTX contains a pentraxin domain that is 69% identical to mouse PTX3. In contrast, residues 83–265 of PPTX are only 42% identical to mouse PTX3. The uneven distribution of the homology score between three regions of PPTX has a similar pattern to the exon organization of PTX3. This result suggests that PPTX is a chicken PTX3 isoform with a sequence that deviated during evolution in the second exon. The PPTX sequence contains two putative N-glycosylation sites that may be responsible for the observed higher molecular mass (∼55 kDa) than theoretically calculated (∼47 kDa). Also, PPTX has nine Cys residues in its sequence of which some are probably responsible for PPTX multimer formation. Colocalization of PPTX and Kv4.2 in the Cochlea—The Kv4.2-PPTX association in vitro led to an examination of expression in cochlear tissues. The results show that Kv4.2 and PPTX are colocalized to specific hair cells of the sensory epithelium as well as to the ganglion cells that innervate these receptor cells (Fig. 3, A–G). A cross-section of the sensory epithelium in Fig. 3A shows a gradation in hair cell length from tall, to intermediate, to short. PPTX (Fig. 3, A–D) colocalizes with Kv4.2 (Fig. 3, F and G) to the basal-lateral regions of intermediate and short hair cells but not tall hair cells. Previously, we showed that Kv4.2 is limited to the soma of the cochlear ganglion cells and the dendritic endings that innervate tall hair cells (19Sokolowski B.H.A. Sakai Y. Harvey M.C. Duzhyy D.E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6265-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similarly, PPTX is found in the soma of cochlear ganglion cells (Fig. 3E). The interaction of PPTX and Kv4.2 was verified in the cochlea by coimmunoprecipitation. The products of coimmunoprecipitation reactions carried out with an anti-Kv4.2 antibody were analyzed for coprecipitation of PPTX. Fig. 3H shows that PPTX coprecipitates with Kv4.2 when using tissue lysates from the chick cochlea. Verification of Interaction with Kv4.2 in Vitro—PPTX deletion variants were used in a yeast two-hybrid analysis to localize the region of PPTX that interacts with Kv4.2. This analysis revealed that deletions at the N terminus of PPTX did not impair yeast cell growth, whereas deletions of the C terminus prevented growth, including the last 22 aa residues (Fig. 4). To additionally test and characterize the Kv4.2-PPTX association, total lysates of CHO cells that expressed both recombinant PPTXmut1-NF and Kv4.2HA were used in coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 5). The justification for using PPTX-mut1 was based on experiments showing that PPTX undergoes truncation during expression in CHO cells (see below). Truncated variants accumulate intracellularly and are likely candidates for interaction with the N-terminal end of Kv4.2. Consequently, FLAG tags placed at the N terminus were cleaved from the protein together with the signal peptide. In comparison, FLAG tags at the C-terminal end produced no coprecipitates, suggesting that the tag interfered with PPTX-Kv4.2 interactions (data not shown). By introducing a mutation at the cleavage site, we were able to stabilize the protein and preserve the N-terminal FLAG tag necessary for antibody recognition. Moreover, this construct maintained the primary structure of wild type PPTX downstream from the cleavage site, including the C terminus, which was needed for the interaction with Kv4.2. Using this variant, anti-FLAG antibody bound to recprotein G-Sepharose beads coprecipitated Kv4.2HA when expressed with PPTXmut1-NF, but not when Kv4.2HA was expressed alone (Fig. 5A, right and middle lanes, respectively). The reciprocal experiments showed that anti-HA pAb coprecipitated PPTXmut1-NF when expressed with Kv4.2HA, but not when expressed alone (Fig. 5B, right and middle lanes, respectively).Fig. 5Coprecipitation using lysates from CHO cells transfected with FLAG-tagged PPTXmut1 and HA-tagged Kv4.2 recombinants.A, anti-FLAG mAb brings down Kv4.2 when coexpressed with PPTXmut1 (right lane), but not when Kv4.2 is expressed alone (middle lane). B, anti-HA pAb brings down PPTXmut1 when coexpressed with Kv4.2 (right lane), but not when PPTX-mut1 is expressed alone (middle lane). Left lanes in A and B are lysate controls. The antibody with which each blot was probed appears at the bottom of each figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PPTX and Kv4.2 colocalization in vitro was demonstrated by transfecting two different mammalian heterologous expression systems and using fluorescent immunostaining to visualize the expression in different regions of the cell. CHO cells expressing PPTX and Kv4.2 were used initially, as these revealed transient currents when using the whole-cell tight seal recording technique (data not shown). These cells showed PPTXmut1-NF as fluorescent red-colored clusters at the membrane (Fig. 6A), whereas expression of Kv4.2HA resulted in fluorescent green-colored clusters (Fig. 6B) when viewed with rhodamine and fluorescein isothiocyanate filters, respectively. Overlapping the two images demonstrated colocalization of the two proteins as visualized by yellow immunofluorescence (Fig. 6C). However, CHO cells showed a clustering of Kv4.2 in the absence of PPTX (data not shown). Because of the large surface area of COS cells, immunohistochemical colocalization was repeated in these cells to visualize the ability of PPTX to act as a shuttle protein. Previous studies suggested that Kv4.2 is locked in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of COS cells in the absence of a shuttle protein such as KChIP (25Shibata R. Misonou H. Campomanes C.R. Anderson A.E. Schrader L.A. Doliveira L.C. Carroll K.I. Sweatt J.D. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36445-36454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Our results show that Kv4.2 was colocalized with PPTX in the region of the ER (Fig. 6, D–F), whereas both proteins were absent at the membrane. Similar outcomes were obtained when cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing Kv4.2HA and full-length, non-tagged, wild type PPTX, where the latter was detected with PTX3 pAb (data not shown). PPTX Is a Secretory Protein—Most of the known long pentraxins, including NP1, Narp, and PTX3 are secreted proteins, whereas others, such as NPR, are membrane-bound receptors. Computer analysis predicted a signal peptide with a cleavage site between aa 20 and 21 of the N terminus. To determine how this signal peptide affects the intracellular and extracellular distribution of PPTX, we transfected CHO cells with either PPTXmut1-NF, which contained aa substitutions that included a FLAG sequence at the cleavage site (Fig. 7A), or with full-length PPTX, which contained a FLAG-tagged C terminus (PPTX-CF).

The relationships between these processes are not well understood. We employed membrane-impermeable lipid marker FM1–43 to explore membrane trafficking upon mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in Jurkat T cells. We established that liberation of intracellular Ca2+ with T cell receptor agonist phytohemagglutinin P or with Ca2+-mobilizing agents ionomycin or thapsigargin induced accumulation of FM1–43 within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), nuclear envelope (NE), and Golgi. FM1–43 loading into ER-NE and Golgi was not mediated via the cytosol because other organelles such as mitochondria and multivesicular bodies located in close proximity to the FM1–43-containing ER were free of dye. Intralumenal FM1–43 accumulation was observed even when Ca2+ signaling in the cytosol was abolished by the removal of extracellular Ca2+. Our findings strongly suggest that release of intracellular Ca2+ may create continuity between the extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane and the lumenal membrane leaflet of the ER by a mechanism that does not require global cytosolic Ca2+ elevation.

Membrane trafficking plays an important role in shaping T cell responses. For example, it is well established that engagement of TCR 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; Iono, ionomycin; MVB, multivesicular bodies; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; NE, nuclear envelope; PCRP, photoconversion reaction product; PHA, phytohemagglutinin P; PM, plasma membrane; Tg, thapsigargin; EM, electron microscopy. 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; Iono, ionomycin; MVB, multivesicular bodies; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; NE, nuclear envelope; PCRP, photoconversion reaction product; PHA, phytohemagglutinin P; PM, plasma membrane; Tg, thapsigargin; EM, electron microscopy. with an antigen triggers fast trafficking of the receptor between the PM and endocytic organelles, resulting in serial TCR engagements and an amplification of intracellular signaling (1Geisler C. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 24: 67-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TCR stimulation is followed by a fast liberation of Ca2+ from Ca2+-storing organelles, such as ER and Golgi (2Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 497-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 3Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Alteration of Ca2+ homeostasis induces a variety of cellular responses ranging from changes in cell shape and motility to activation of transcription factors (2Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 497-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether changes in intracellular Ca2+ dynamics affect membrane trafficking in T lymphocytes. Styryl dye FM1–43 is a fluorescent membrane marker that reversibly partitions into but does not penetrate biological membranes (4Cochilla A.J. Angleson J.K. Betz W.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that FM1–43 was readily internalized from the PM into the endocytic compartments of human T cells by constitutive endocytosis (5Fomina A.F. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Cahalan M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 291: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (Iono) or thapsigargin (Tg), a sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pumps blocker, facilitated FM1–43 internalization (5Fomina A.F. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Cahalan M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 291: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) might accelerate the rate of endocytosis in T cells. However, an EM study performed previously in the Xenopus larvae hair cells revealed the presence of FM1–43 within non-endocytic organelles such as ER, NE, and mitochondria (6Nishikawa S. Sasaki F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These results led to a suggestion that FM1–43 can penetrate the PM and diffuse through the cytosol. To further investigate the nature of enhanced FM1–43 internalization following liberation of intracellular Ca2+ in T cells, we studied subcellular distribution of FM1–43 using correlative fluorescence and electron microscopy. We found that stimulation of Jurkat T cells with TCR agonist, phytohemagglutinin P (PHA), or with the Ca2+-mobilizing agents, Tg or Iono, produced FM1–43 translocation from the PM into the lumen of peripheral ER followed by the dye spreading into NE and Golgi. This effect did not require global elevation in [Ca2+]i since it was observed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. The presence of FM1–43 in the lumen of the ER, NE, and Golgi appeared not to be mediated via the cytosol as other organelles (mitochondria and multivesicular bodies (MVB)) remained free of dye. Our findings suggest that intracellular Ca2+ release may generate continuity between the ER and the PM, resulting in direct membrane exchange between those organelles. Cell Culture and Chemicals—Human T-cell line, Jurkat E6-1 (ATCC, Manassas, VA), was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific Inc., Tarzana, CA). Cells were maintained in suspension in 5% CO2 at 37 °C and passaged every 2 days. Unless indicated, all chemicals were from Sigma. Ionomycin and thapsigagin were from Calbiochem. FM1–43 and Fura-2/AM were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Modified Tyrode's solution contained (in mm): 130 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 d-glucose; pH 7.3. In Ca2+-free solution, Ca2+ was omitted, and 5 mm EGTA was added. FM1–43 Fluorescence—Cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated 35-mm glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and incubated with 5 μm FM1–43 as specified under “Results.” Cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml PHA, 1 μm Tg, or 1 μm Iono. All experiments were done at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were washed five times with Tyrode's solution and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 21 °C. After washing, cells were placed onto the stage of an Axiovert 100 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany), and fluorescence images were acquired with LSM 510 laser scanning confocal imaging system (Carl Zeiss) using a ×63/1.4 or ×100/1.4 oil immersion Zeiss objectives. For FM1–43 fluorescence, 488 nm excitation and 505–550 nm emission filters were used. A pinhole was opened to collect fluorescence from 2-μm optical slice. MetaMorph v6.1 software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA) was used to determine the pixel densities of FM1–43 fluorescence as shown below (see Fig. 1). Photoconversion and EM Imaging—Photoconversion experiments were performed as described previously (5Fomina A.F. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Cahalan M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 291: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with FM1–43 for different times and conditions. Cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and then placed into oxygenated sodium cacodylate buffer (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) containing 1 mg/ml diaminobenzidine on the stage of Axiovert 100 microscope (Carl Zeiss). Cells were illuminated by a 100-watt mercury lamp through a Zeiss ×40/1.3 objective for 10–15 min. Samples were processed for EM, and thin sections were examined with a Phillips 400 electron microscope. The total number of cells and number of cells containing the photoconversion reaction product were counted within 6–8 randomly selected sections. Each experiment was repeated 1–3 times. Cytosolic Ca2+Measurements—Changes in [Ca2+]i were recorded as described earlier (7Fomina A.F. Fanger C.M. Kozak J.A. Cahalan M.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1435-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) using Fura-2 acetoxymethylester (Fura-2/AM). Briefly, cells were loaded with 1 μm Fura-2 acetoxymethylester (Fura-2/AM) for 5 min in Tyrode's solution, washed, and incubated for an additional 30 min. Fluorescence images were acquired from adherent cells with SenSys CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) using a ×40/1.15 water immersion Olympus objective. Lambda DG-4 filter changer (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA) was used for switching between 340 and 380 nm excitation filters. Experiments were done at room temperature. Solution exchange was performed via a gravity-driven perfusion system. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using MetaFluor v6.1 software (Universal Imaging). Cytosolic concentrations of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) were estimated from Fura-2 calibration as described previously (8Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Data analysis and statistics were performed with Microcal Origin 7.0 software (Microcal Software, Inc.). All statistical data are presented as mean ± S.E. FM1–43 Stains the Nuclear Membrane after Mobilization of Intracellular Ca2+—Incubation of Jurkat T cells with FM1–43 resulted in spontaneous dye accumulation within the cytosol (Fig. 1, A–C) similarly to what was described previously for human T lymphocytes (5Fomina A.F. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Cahalan M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 291: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Stimulation of TCR with PHA enhanced FM1–43 accumulation (Fig. 1, D–F) in parallel with elevation in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1G). High resolution imaging revealed the existence of a bright ring of FM1–43 fluorescence originating from the perinuclear area in PHA-treated cells (Fig. 1, E and F). Direct stimulation of intracellular Ca2+ release with Iono or Tg (not shown) produced similar results. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ significantly reduced [Ca2+]i, elevation in response to Ca2+-mobilizing agents (Fig. 1G) but had little effect on the enhancement of perinuclear fluorescence (Fig. 1H). Overall, stimulation of Ca2+ release in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+ resulted in an ∼2-fold increase in average amplitude of perinuclear FM1–43 fluorescence. These data suggested that stimulation of Ca2+ release triggered FM1–43 accumulation at the perinuclear area by a mechanism that did not require global [Ca2+]i elevation. Staining of the intracellular organelles including NE with FM1–43 may occur as a result of the “flip-flop” of FM1–43 through the PM and partitioning into the cytosolic leaflet of organelle membranes. To determine an origin of the intracellular FM1–43 fluorescence, we subjected FM1–43-loaded cells to a photoconversion procedure that has been shown to result in a formation of an electron-dense photoconversion reaction product (PCRP) in place of a fluorophore, such as FM1–43 (9Deerinck T.J. Martone M.E. Lev-Ram V. Green D.P. Tsien R.Y. Spector D.L. Huang S. Ellisman M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 10Henkel A.W. Lubke J. Betz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1918-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This allowed EM investigation of the subcellular FM1–43 distribution. Precipitation of PCRP within the ER, NE, and Golgi Lumen after Ca2+Liberation—EM study of non-stimulated Jurkat T cells incubated with FM1–43 (Control) revealed the presence of PCRP within endocytic organelles (early and late endosomes and MVB, Fig. 2A), which closely resembled endocytic compartments in activated human T lymphocytes (5Fomina A.F. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Cahalan M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 291: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The ER (Fig. 2Ai) and Golgi (Fig. 2Aii) remained free of dye, indicating that they were not directly connected with the constitutive endocytic pathway. These results demonstrated that FM1–43 did not penetrate the PM of unstimulated Jurkat T cells but spread within the lumen of the endocytic organelles due to constitutive endocytosis. Consistent with the appearance of FM1–43 fluorescence at the perinuclear area (Fig. 1E), EM study revealed an accumulation of PCRP within the ER, NE, and Golgi of PHA-stimulated cells in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 2, B and C). Similar effects were observed after stimulation with Tg (Fig. 3A) or Iono (Fig. 3B). The percentage of cells displaying strong PCRP precipitation within the ER lumen increased from <5% at unstimulated conditions to ∼15–30% after stimulation of Ca2+ release in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3C). Thus, EM study suggested that stimulation of Ca2+ release triggered translocation of FM1–43 from the PM into the lumen of the ER, NE, and Golgi. Accumulation of FM1–43 within the ER, NE, and Golgi Is Not Mediated via the Cytosol—In unstimulated cells, the PCRP was frequently observed within the mitochondria (Fig. 2A). Previously, we reported that in human T cells, some mitochondria precipitated PCRP even in the absence of FM1–43 (5Fomina A.F. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Cahalan M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 291: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The high oxidative potential of the mitochondria might account for the nonspecific PCRP precipitation. Although at unstimulated conditions, PCRP was not found within the ER, NE, and Golgi, a nonspecific PCRP precipitation could be induced by changes in the intralumenal environment within those organelles upon Ca2+ mobilization. To eliminate this possibility, we performed prolonged photoconversion (20–40 min) after cells were incubated with Iono in the absence of FM1–43. This resulted in an enhanced precipitation of PCRP within mitochondria and at the PM but not at the ER, NE, and Golgi (Fig. 4A). Only a small fraction of cells (Fig. 3C) displayed nonspecific precipitation of PCRP within the ER. Thus, changes in intralumenal environment after Ca2+ liberation could not account for the appearance of PCRP within the ER, NE, and Golgi. We concluded that the presence of PCRP indicated the presence of FM1–43 within the lumen of the ER, NE, and Golgi. The remaining question was how FM1–43 appeared within non-endocytic organelles. We demonstrated that mitochondria precipitate PCRP in the absence of FM1–43. Consistent with functional heterogeneity of the mitochondria within a cell (11Collins T.J. Bootman M.D. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1993-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), typical photoconversion produced PCRP precipitation in only some mitochondria (Figs. 2 and 3) or did not produce it at all (Fig. 4B). In those cells, regions of the ER and Golgi containing PCRP were frequently located at close proximity to PCRP-free mitochondria (Fig. 4Bi). In addition, Jurkat T cells usually contained large MVB that did not accumulate FM1–43. Those organelles were often located in close proximity to the PCRP-containing ER and Golgi (Fig. 4C). These observations were difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that FM1–43 “flipflopped” through the PM and spread via the cytosol as in that case, PCRP should be present at the cytosolic leaflet of the membranes of all organelles. We concluded that upon Ca2+ liberation FM1–43 was translocated from the PM directly into the lumen ER-NE and Golgi bypassing the cytosol. FM1–43 Spreads from the Peripheral ER toward NE and Golgi—The ER is connected with the NE lumenally (12Mattaj I.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and with Golgi by vesicular trafficking (13Lee M.C. Miller E.A. Goldberg J. Orci L. Schekman R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 87-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Therefore, FM1–43 should spread within the lumen of ER, NE, and Golgi even if only one of those organelles establishes continuity with the PM. To determine the direction of the FM1–43 spreading within intracellular organelles, we investigated cells with partial staining of the intracellular compartments (Fig. 5). In those cells, PCRP was always located within the peripheral ER (Fig. 5Ai) and neighboring NE, whereas regions of the ER, Golgi (Fig. 5Aii), and NE (Fig. 5Aiii) located in the middle of the cell remained free of dye. Because a number of cells displayed FM1–43 loading into the peripheral ER but not into the Golgi and all cells with stained Golgi displayed PCRP within the ER, we concluded that FM1–43 spread from the peripheral ER toward the NE and Golgi. Our EM study revealed the existence of tubular membrane compartments adjacent to the PM (Fig. 5B). The presence of bound ribosomes at some regions of those compartments indicated that they were parts of the ER. Smooth areas of the same compartment were docked to the PM. At membrane contact sites, the distances between ER and PM were ∼10 nm, implying that interactions at the molecular level could take place. Docking of the ER-like compartments to the PM remained unaffected after stimulation of Ca2+ release (Fig. 5C), implying that FM1–43 transfer may be mediated via ER-PM contact sites. Our study demonstrated that in Jurkat T lymphocytes, activation of intracellular Ca2+ release by stimulation of membrane receptors or by Ca2+-mobilizing agents produced a fast loading of membrane-bound lipid marker FM1–43 from the extracellular leaflet of the PM into the lumen of intracellular organelles: ER, NE, and Golgi. The presence of FM1–43 within those compartments was detected with fluorescence microscopy as the FM1–43 fluorescence from the NE and with EM as the PCRP precipitation within the lumen of ER, NE, and Golgi. These observations are consistent with previously observed FM1–43 loading into the ER lumen of Xenopus larvae hair cells (6Nishikawa S. Sasaki F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our EM study demonstrated that cells with FM1–43 loading into ER, NE, and Golgi lumen did not display any ultrastructural changes such as chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, cell shrinkage, mitochondrial swelling, or inflammation of the ER and NE that were found to be associated with different stages of T cell apoptosis or necrosis (14Chen S.C. Huang C.C. Chien C.L. Jeng C.J. Su H.T. Chiang E. Liu M.R. Wu C.H. Chang C.N. Lin R.H. Blood. 2004; 104: 3233-3242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Cornelissen M. Philippe J. De Sitter S. De Ridder L. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Weller M. Malipiero U. Groscurth P. Fontana A. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggest that the ability to accumulate FM1–43 within ER lumen upon stimulation is the property of normal viable cells. In an earlier study, Nishikawa and Sasaki (6Nishikawa S. Sasaki F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) found PCRP in both the ER and the mitochondria. That was interpreted as a non-selective staining of intercellular organelles and led the authors to the conclusion that FM1–43 penetrated the PM and spread through the cytosol. Two lines of evidence indicated that FM1–43 loading into ER, NE, and Golgi in Jurkat T cells was not mediated via the cytosol. First, our previous results (5Fomina A.F. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Cahalan M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 291: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and the present study (Fig. 3A) demonstrated PCRP precipitation by mitochondria in the absence of FM1–43, challenging the assumption that an existence of PCRP within the mitochondria validates the presence of FM1–43 within those organelles. Second, FM1–43-filled ER regions were located in close apposition to other organelles that did not contain FM1–43 (Fig. 4, B and C), indicating that FM1–43 was selectively targeted into the ER, NE, and Golgi lumen. These data strongly suggest that upon Ca2+ liberation, continuity may be established between the extracellular leaflet of the PM and the luminal membrane leaflet of the ER, allowing a direct flow of the membrane-bound marker from the PM into the lumen of interconnected intracellular organelles. Our data demonstrated that FM1–43 first appeared at the peripheral ER and then spread toward the NE and Golgi. ER and PM membrane contact sites were present in unstimulated cells (Fig. 5B) and remained intact after stimulation of Ca2+ release and FM1–43 loading into ER lumen (Fig. 5C). These observations suggest that FM1–43 transfer into the ER lumen could occur via ER-PM contact sites. Smooth ER was found in close apposition to the PM in several cell types. There is increasing evidence that non-vesicular transport of small lipids between the cytosolic membrane leaflets of the ER and other organelles is concentrated at the membrane contact sites and is mediated by carrier proteins (17Levine T. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 483-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This transport mechanism, however, appears to be different from the FM1–43 transport mechanism into the ER since the latter does not involve the cytosolic membrane surfaces. Recently, fusion of the ER with the PM and an exchange of proteins was described in macrophages during phagocytosis (18Gagnon E. Duclos S. Rondeau C. Chevet E. Cameron P.H. Steele-Mortimer O. Paiement J. Bergeron J.J. Desjardins M. Cell. 2002; 110: 119-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). It was established that stimulation of macrophage lipopolysaccharide receptors activated phospholipase C, which in turn resulted in the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and intracellular Ca2+ liberation (19Chow C.W. Grinstein S. Rotstein O.D. New Horiz. 1995; 3: 342-351PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesize that in T lymphocytes, intracellular Ca2+ release could trigger fusion of ER with the PM, and FM1–43 might laterally diffuse from the PM into the ER lumen. Although the exact mechanism underlying molecular exchange between the PM and ER lumen requires further investigation, the structural organization of the ER (20Bootman M.D. Petersen O.H. Verkhratsky A. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) implies that it may serve as a vehicle for spreading molecular signals from the extracellular space to intracellular organelles. Quantification of the photoconversion experiments revealed that 15–30% of cells precipitated PCRP within the ER. Although this was a dramatic increase when compared with the control cell population (<5%), it appeared that only a fraction of cells may have established the continuity between the ER and PM upon stimulation. It should be noted, however, that the photoconversion procedure may not reveal all cells that accumulated FM1–43 within the ER since PCRP precipitation may be affected by the concentration of fluorophore and environmental factors. It is conceivable that only a fraction of cells at the certain physiological state may establish strong ER-PM links and may accumulate a sufficient amount of the FM1–43 within the ER lumen to produce PCRP precipitation, whereas cells with low FM1–43 concentration may fail to precipitate PCRP. Therefore, the exact incidence of the FM1–43 loading into ER lumen in total cell population and the specific characteristics of the cells that display strong dye accumulation upon stimulation remain to be determined. Weak dependence of FM1–43 loading into ER-NE-Golgi lumen from [Ca2+]i implied that Ca2+ concentration within ER may be a key factor that triggered ER-PM interactions. Our data suggest that ER-PM fusion could take place upon store depletion; therefore, it is conceivable that soluble molecules can follow the same pathway as a membrane-bound dye. Because ER, NE, and Golgi are major constituents of the intracellular Ca2+ store (2Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 497-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 3Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 21Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the ER-PM fusion sites may allow Ca2+ entry from the extracellular space directly into the store lumen. Although the store can be effectively replenished from the cytosol via Ca2+-ATPase (22Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar), a recent study demonstrated that in Jurkat T cells, the store can be refilled in the absence of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump activity (23Narayanan B. Islam M.N. Bartelt D. Ochs R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44188-44196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Direct Ca2+ flow from the extracellular space into the ER might complement the Ca2+-ATPase refilling pathway and might be important for both Ca2+ signaling and protein handling within intracellular organelles.
