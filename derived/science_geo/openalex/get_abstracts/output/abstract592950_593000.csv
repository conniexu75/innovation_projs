https://openalex.org/W2744268790,"Hundreds of circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly abundant in the mammalian brain, often with conserved expression. Here we show that the circRNA Cdr1as is massively bound by the microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-7 and miR-671 in human and mouse brains. When the Cdr1as locus was removed from the mouse genome, knockout animals displayed impaired sensorimotor gating-a deficit in the ability to filter out unnecessary information-which is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Electrophysiological recordings revealed dysfunctional synaptic transmission. Expression of miR-7 and miR-671 was specifically and posttranscriptionally misregulated in all brain regions analyzed. Expression of immediate early genes such as Fos, a direct miR-7 target, was enhanced in Cdr1as-deficient brains, providing a possible molecular link to the behavioral phenotype. Our data indicate an in vivo loss-of-function circRNA phenotype and suggest that interactions between Cdr1as and miRNAs are important for normal brain function."
https://openalex.org/W2743073899,"Perturbation of the gut-associated microbial community may underlie many human illnesses, but the mechanisms that maintain homeostasis are poorly understood. We found that the depletion of butyrate-producing microbes by antibiotic treatment reduced epithelial signaling through the intracellular butyrate sensor peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ). Nitrate levels increased in the colonic lumen because epithelial expression of Nos2, the gene encoding inducible nitric oxide synthase, was elevated in the absence of PPAR-γ signaling. Microbiota-induced PPAR-γ signaling also limits the luminal bioavailability of oxygen by driving the energy metabolism of colonic epithelial cells (colonocytes) toward β-oxidation. Therefore, microbiota-activated PPAR-γ signaling is a homeostatic pathway that prevents a dysbiotic expansion of potentially pathogenic Escherichia and Salmonella by reducing the bioavailability of respiratory electron acceptors to Enterobacteriaceae in the lumen of the colon."
https://openalex.org/W2744367050,"A warming climate is expected to have an impact on the magnitude and timing of river floods; however, no consistent large-scale climate change signal in observed flood magnitudes has been identified so far. We analyzed the timing of river floods in Europe over the past five decades, using a pan-European database from 4262 observational hydrometric stations, and found clear patterns of change in flood timing. Warmer temperatures have led to earlier spring snowmelt floods throughout northeastern Europe; delayed winter storms associated with polar warming have led to later winter floods around the North Sea and some sectors of the Mediterranean coast; and earlier soil moisture maxima have led to earlier winter floods in western Europe. Our results highlight the existence of a clear climate signal in flood observations at the continental scale."
https://openalex.org/W2742842976,"Xenotransplantation is a promising strategy to alleviate the shortage of organs for human transplantation. In addition to the concerns about pig-to-human immunological compatibility, the risk of cross-species transmission of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) has impeded the clinical application of this approach. We previously demonstrated the feasibility of inactivating PERV activity in an immortalized pig cell line. We now confirm that PERVs infect human cells, and we observe the horizontal transfer of PERVs among human cells. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we inactivated all of the PERVs in a porcine primary cell line and generated PERV-inactivated pigs via somatic cell nuclear transfer. Our study highlights the value of PERV inactivation to prevent cross-species viral transmission and demonstrates the successful production of PERV-inactivated animals to address the safety concern in clinical xenotransplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2743713902,"Vicinal diamines are a common structural motif in bioactive natural products, therapeutic agents, and molecular catalysts, motivating the continuing development of efficient, selective, and sustainable technologies for their preparation. We report an operationally simple and environmentally friendly protocol that converts alkenes and sodium azide—both readily available feedstocks—to 1,2-diazides. Powered by electricity and catalyzed by Earth-abundant manganese, this transformation proceeds under mild conditions and exhibits exceptional substrate generality and functional group compatibility. Using standard protocols, the resultant 1,2-diazides can be smoothly reduced to vicinal diamines in a single step, with high chemoselectivity. Mechanistic studies are consistent with metal-mediated azidyl radical transfer as the predominant pathway, enabling dual carbon-nitrogen bond formation."
https://openalex.org/W2744535290,"Some people hear voices that others do not, but only some of those people seek treatment. Using a Pavlovian learning task, we induced conditioned hallucinations in four groups of people who differed orthogonally in their voice-hearing and treatment-seeking statuses. People who hear voices were significantly more susceptible to the effect. Using functional neuroimaging and computational modeling of perception, we identified processes that differentiated voice-hearers from non–voice-hearers and treatment-seekers from non–treatment-seekers and characterized a brain circuit that mediated the conditioned hallucinations. These data demonstrate the profound and sometimes pathological impact of top-down cognitive processes on perception and may represent an objective means to discern people with a need for treatment from those without."
https://openalex.org/W2744040456,"The mammalian brain contains diverse neuronal types, yet we lack single-cell epigenomic assays that are able to identify and characterize them. DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark that distinguishes cell types and marks regulatory elements. We generated >6000 methylomes from single neuronal nuclei and used them to identify 16 mouse and 21 human neuronal subpopulations in the frontal cortex. CG and non-CG methylation exhibited cell type-specific distributions, and we identified regulatory elements with differential methylation across neuron types. Methylation signatures identified a layer 6 excitatory neuron subtype and a unique human parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neuron subtype. We observed stronger cross-species conservation of regulatory elements in inhibitory neurons than in excitatory neurons. Single-nucleus methylomes expand the atlas of brain cell types and identify regulatory elements that drive conserved brain cell diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2744291776,"All-cis-multifluorinated cycloalkanes exhibit intriguing electronic properties. In particular, they display extremely high dipole moments perpendicular to the aliphatic ring, making them highly desired motifs in material science. Very few such motifs have been prepared, as their syntheses require multistep sequences from diastereoselectively prefunctionalized precursors. Herein we report a synthetic strategy to access these valuable materials via the rhodium-cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC)-catalyzed hydrogenation of readily available fluorinated arenes in hexane. This route enables the scalable single-step preparation of an abundance of multisubstituted and multifluorinated cycloalkanes, including all-cis-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorocyclohexane as well as cis-configured fluorinated aliphatic heterocycles."
https://openalex.org/W2743628650,"The extent to which scientific advances support marketplace inventions is largely unknown. We study 4.8 million U.S. patents and 32 million research articles to determine the minimum citation distance between patented inventions and prior scientific advances. We find that most cited research articles (80%) link forward to a future patent. Similarly, most patents (61%) link backward to a prior research article. Linked papers and patents typically stand 2 to 4 degrees distant from the other domain. Yet, advances directly along the patent-paper boundary are notably more impactful within their own domains. The distance metric further provides a typology of the fields, institutions, and individuals involved in science-to-technology linkages. Overall, the findings are consistent with theories that emphasize substantial and fruitful connections between patenting and prior scientific inquiry."
https://openalex.org/W2743709860,"Small basic proteins present in most Archaea share a common ancestor with the eukaryotic core histones. We report the crystal structure of an archaeal histone-DNA complex. DNA wraps around an extended polymer, formed by archaeal histone homodimers, in a quasi-continuous superhelix with the same geometry as DNA in the eukaryotic nucleosome. Substitutions of a conserved glycine at the interface of adjacent protein layers destabilize archaeal chromatin, reduce growth rate, and impair transcription regulation, confirming the biological importance of the polymeric structure. Our data establish that the histone-based mechanism of DNA compaction predates the nucleosome, illuminating the origin of the nucleosome."
https://openalex.org/W2745057783,"Location, location, location The distribution of RNA in cells is important for efficient translation into proteins. Asymmetric RNA localization is known in several cell types but is poorly understood in gut epithelial cells. Moor et al. found that transcripts in intestinal enterocytes tend to distribute to the cells' apical or basal cell sides (see the Perspective by Gáspár and Ephrussi). mRNA localization does not generally overlap protein localization; instead, ribosomes are apically biased, which allows more efficient translation. On refeeding of fasted mice, gut cell mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins exhibit a basal-to-apical shift in localization and a boost in translation. Thus, dynamic polarization of mRNA and polarized translation modulate translational efficiency in the intestinal epithelium. Science , this issue p. 1299 ; see also p. 1235"
https://openalex.org/W2750486618,"Familiarity alters face recognition: Familiar faces are recognized more accurately than unfamiliar ones and under difficult viewing conditions when unfamiliar face recognition fails. The neural basis for this fundamental difference remains unknown. Using whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that personally familiar faces engage the macaque face-processing network more than unfamiliar faces. Familiar faces also recruited two hitherto unknown face areas at anatomically conserved locations within the perirhinal cortex and the temporal pole. These two areas, but not the core face-processing network, responded to familiar faces emerging from a blur with a characteristic nonlinear surge, akin to the abruptness of familiar face recognition. In contrast, responses to unfamiliar faces and objects remained linear. Thus, two temporal lobe areas extend the core face-processing network into a familiar face-recognition system."
https://openalex.org/W2742677019,"The emergence of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing has given new urgency to calls from social scientists, bench scientists, and scientific associations for broad public dialogue about human genome editing and its applications. Most recently, these calls were formalized in a consensus report on the science, ethics, and governance of human genome editing released by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) that argued for public engagement to be incorporated into the policy-making process for human genome editing (1). So, where does the public stand on the issue of human genome editing? And how do those attitudes translate into the desire for more public input on human genome editing as new applications emerge in the policy arena?"
https://openalex.org/W2743122838,"Metabolic programming of tissue APCs Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are scattered throughout the body in lymphoid organs and at the portals of pathogen entry, where they act as sentinels of the immune system. Sinclair et al. demonstrate that APCs at different sites have distinctive metabolic signatures and that the development and function of these cells are determined not only by their transcriptional program, but also by their metabolic state (see the Perspective by Wiesner and Klein). The authors identified a central role for mTOR in mediating the metabolic adaptation of such tissue-resident APCs by influencing the immunological character of allergic inflammation. Thus, tissues endow resident APCs with distinctive metabolic characteristics that control APC development and function. Science , this issue p. 1014 ; see also p. 973"
https://openalex.org/W2745078986,"3D printing has the potential to deliver personalized implants and devices for obstetric and gynecologic applications. The aim of this study is to engineer customizable and biodegradable 3D printed implant materials that can elute estrogen and/or progesterone. All 3D constructs were printed using polycaprolactone (PCL) biodegradable polymer laden with estrogen or progesterone and were subjected to hormone-release profile studies using ELISA kits. Material thermal properties were tested using thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. The 3D printed constructs showed extended hormonal release over a one week period. Cytocompatibility and bioactivity were assessed using a luciferase assay. The hormone-laden 3D printed constructs demonstrated an increase in luciferase activity and without any deleterious effects. Thermal properties of the PCL and hormones showed degradation temperatures above that of the temperature used in the additive manufacturing process–suggesting that 3D printing can be achieved below the degradation temperatures of the hormones. Sample constructs in the shape of surgical meshes, subdermal rods, intrauterine devices and pessaries were designed and printed. 3D printing of estrogen and progesterone-eluting constructs was feasible in this proof of concept study. These custom designs have the potential to act as a form of personalized medicine for drug delivery and optimized fit based on patient-specific anatomy."
https://openalex.org/W2744426654,"Background Cost-effectiveness rankings of health interventions are useful inputs for national healthcare planning and budgeting. Previous comprehensive rankings for low- and middle- income countries were undertaken in 2005 and 2006, accompanying the development of strategies for the Millennium Development Goals. We update the rankings using studies published since 2000, as strategies are being considered for the Sustainable Development Goals. Methods Expert systematic searches of the literature were undertaken for a broad range of health interventions. Cost-effectiveness results using Disability Adjusted Life-Years (DALYs) as the health outcome were standardized to 2012 US dollars. Results 149 individual studies of 93 interventions qualified for inclusion. Interventions for Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health accounted for 37% of interventions, and major infectious diseases (AIDS, TB, malaria and neglected tropical diseases) for 24%, consistent with the priorities of the Millennium Development Goals. More than half of the interventions considered cost less than $200 per DALY and hence can be considered for inclusion in Universal Health Care packages even in low-income countries. Discussion Important changes have occurred in rankings since 2006. Priorities have changed as a result of new technologies, new methods for changing behavior, and significant price changes for some vaccines and drugs. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals will require LMICs to study a broader range of health interventions, particularly in adult health. Some interventions are no longer studied, in some cases because they have become usual care, in other cases because they are no longer relevant. Updating cost-effectiveness rankings on a regular basis is potentially a valuable exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2745309325,"Salivary gland inflammation is a hallmark of Sjogren's syndrome (SS), a common autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary gland and loss of saliva secretion, predominantly in women. The P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) is an ATP-gated nonselective cation channel that induces inflammatory responses in cells and tissues, including salivary gland epithelium. In immune cells, P2X7R activation induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β and IL-18, by inducing the oligomerization of the multiprotein complex NLRP3-type inflammasome. Here, our results show that in primary mouse submandibular gland (SMG) epithelial cells, P2X7R activation also induces the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the maturation and release of IL-1β, a response that is absent in SMG cells isolated from mice deficient in P2X7Rs (P2X7R−/−). P2X7R-mediated IL-1β release in SMG epithelial cells is dependent on transmembrane Na+ and/or K+ flux and the activation of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a protein required for the activation and stabilization of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Also, using the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers N-acetyl cysteine and Mito-TEMPO, we determined that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species are required for P2X7R-mediated IL-1β release. Lastly, in vivo administration of the P2X7R antagonist A438079 in the CD28−/−, IFNγ−/−, NOD.H-2h4 mouse model of salivary gland exocrinopathy ameliorated salivary gland inflammation and enhanced carbachol-induced saliva secretion. These findings demonstrate that P2X7R antagonism in vivo represents a promising therapeutic strategy to limit salivary gland inflammation and improve secretory function."
https://openalex.org/W2744621523,"A parabolic relationship between lens radius and refractive index allows spherical lenses to avoid spherical aberration. We show that in squid, patchy colloidal physics resulted from an evolutionary radiation of globular S-crystallin proteins. Small-angle x-ray scattering experiments on lens tissue show colloidal gels of S-crystallins at all radial positions. Sparse lens materials form via low-valence linkages between disordered loops protruding from the protein surface. The loops are polydisperse and bind via a set of hydrogen bonds between disordered side chains. Peripheral lens regions with low particle valence form stable, volume-spanning gels at low density, whereas central regions with higher average valence gel at higher densities. The proteins demonstrate an evolved set of linkers for self-assembly of nanoparticles into volumetric materials."
https://openalex.org/W2744752043,"Thick, rigid continents move over the weaker underlying mantle, although geophysical and geochemical constraints on the exact thickness and defining mechanism of the continental plates are widely discrepant. Xenoliths suggest a chemical continental lithosphere ~175 kilometers thick, whereas seismic tomography supports a much thicker root (>250 kilometers) and a gradual lithosphere-asthenosphere transition, consistent with a thermal definition. We modeled SS precursor waveforms from continental interiors and found a 7 to 9% velocity drop at depths of 130 to 190 kilometers. The discontinuity depth is well correlated with the origin depths of diamond-bearing xenoliths and corresponds to the transition from coarse to deformed xenoliths. At this depth, the xenolith-derived geotherm also intersects the carbonate-silicate solidus, suggesting that partial melt defines the plate boundaries beneath the continental interior."
https://openalex.org/W2743261761,"Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), which catalyzes purine catabolism, has two interconvertible forms, xanthine dehydrogenase and xanthine oxidase, the latter of which produces superoxide during uric acid (UA) synthesis. An association between plasma XOR activity and cardiovascular and renal outcomes has been previously suggested. We investigated the potential association between cardiac parameters and plasma XOR activity among cardiology patients.Plasma XOR activity was measured by [13C2,15N2]xanthine coupled with liquid chromatography/triplequadrupole mass spectrometry. Among 270 patients who were not taking UA-lowering drugs, XOR activity was associated with body mass index (BMI), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), HbA1c and renal function. Although XOR activity was not associated with serum UA overall, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), those with higher XOR activity had higher serum UA among patients without CKD. Compared with patients with the lowest XOR activity quartile, those with higher three XOR activity quartiles more frequently had left ventricular hypertrophy. In addition, plasma XOR activity showed a U-shaped association with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and increased plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, and these associations were independent of age, gender, BMI, ALT, HbA1C, serum UA, and CKD stages.Among cardiac patients, left ventricular hypertrophy, low LVEF, and increased BNP were significantly associated with plasma XOR activity independent of various confounding factors. Whether pharmaceutical modification of plasma XOR activity might inhibit cardiac remodeling and improve cardiovascular outcome should be investigated in future studies."

https://openalex.org/W2743086886,"The mechanisms underlying endothelial cell injury and defective vascular repair in systemic sclerosis (SSc) remain unclear. Since the recently discovered angiogenic T cells (Tang) may have an important role in the repair of damaged endothelium, this study aimed to analyze the Tang population in relation to disease-related peripheral vascular features in SSc patients. Tang (CD3+CD31+CXCR4+) were quantified by flow cytometry in peripheral blood samples from 39 SSc patients and 18 healthy controls (HC). Circulating levels of the CXCR4 ligand stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α and proangiogenic factors were assessed in paired serum samples by immunoassay. Serial skin sections from SSc patients and HC were subjected to CD3/CD31 and CD3/CXCR4 double immunofluorescence. Circulating Tang were significantly increased in SSc patients with digital ulcers (DU) compared either with SSc patients without DU or with HC. Tang levels were significantly higher in SSc patients with late nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) pattern than in those with early/active NVC patterns and in HC. No difference in circulating Tang was found when comparing either SSc patients without DU or patients with early/active NVC patterns and HC. In SSc peripheral blood, Tang percentage was inversely correlated to levels of SDF-1α and CD34+CD133+VEGFR-2+ endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), and positively correlated to levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-9. Tang were frequently detected in SSc dermal perivascular inflammatory infiltrates. In summary, our findings demonstrate for the first time that Tang cells are selectively expanded in the circulation of SSc patients displaying severe peripheral vascular complications like DU. In SSc, Tang may represent a potentially useful biomarker reflecting peripheral vascular damage severity. Tang expansion may be an ineffective attempt to compensate the need for increased angiogenesis and EPC function. Further studies are required to clarify the function of Tang cells and investigate the mechanisms responsible for their change in SSc."
https://openalex.org/W2743863009,"The functional recruitment of classic brown adipose tissue (BAT) and inducible brown-like or beige fat is, to a large extent, dependent on intact sympathetic neural input. Whereas the central neural circuits directed specifically to BAT or white adipose tissue (WAT) are well established, there is only a developing insight into the nature of neural inputs common to both fat types. Moreover, there is no clear view of the specific central and peripheral innervation of the browned component of WAT: beige fat. The objective of the present study is to examine the neural input to both BAT and WAT in the same animal and, by exposing different cohorts of rats to either thermoneutral or cold conditions, define changes in central neural organization that will ensure that beige fat is appropriately recruited and modulated after browning of inguinal WAT (iWAT). At thermoneutrality, injection of the neurotropic (pseudorabies) viruses into BAT and WAT demonstrates that there are dedicated axonal projections, as well as collateral axonal branches of command neurons projecting to both types of fat. After cold exposure, central neural circuits directed to iWAT showed evidence of reorganization with a greater representation of command neurons projecting to both brown and beiged WAT in hypothalamic (paraventricular nucleus and lateral hypothalamus) and brainstem (raphe pallidus and locus coeruleus) sites. This shift was driven by a greater number of supraspinal neurons projecting to iWAT under cold conditions. These data provide evidence for a reorganization of the nervous system at the level of neural connectivity following browning of WAT.—Wiedmann, N. M., Stefanidis, A., Oldfield, B. J.

https://openalex.org/W2742784414,"Objectives To investigate at what age preterm infants develop a salivary cortisol circadian rhythm and identify whether it is dependent on gestational age and/or postnatal age. To evaluate whether salivary cortisol circadian rhythm development is related to behavioral regularity. To elucidate salivary cortisol levels in preterm infants during the first year of life. Methods This prospective, longitudinal study included 51 preterm infants. 130 healthy full-term infants served as controls. Monthly salivary cortisol levels were obtained in the morning (07:30–09:30), at noon (10:00–12:00), and in the evening (19:30–21:30), beginning at gestational age week 28–32 and continuing until twelve months corrected age. Behavioral regularity was studied using the Baby Behavior Questionnaire. Results A salivary cortisol circadian rhythm was established by one month corrected age and persisted throughout the first year. The preterm infants showed a cortisol pattern increasingly more alike the full-term infants as the first year progressed. The preterm infants increase in behavioral regularity with age but no correlation was found between the development of salivary cortisol circadian rhythm and the development of behavior regularity. The time to establish salivary cortisol circadian rhythm differed between preterm and full-term infants according to postnatal age (p = 0.001) and was dependent on gestational age. Monthly salivary cortisol levels for preterm infants from birth until twelve months are presented. Additional findings were that topical corticosteroid medication was associated with higher concentrations of salivary cortisol (p = 0.02) and establishment of salivary cortisol circadian rhythm occurred later in infants treated with topical corticosteroid medication (p = 0.02). Conclusions Salivary cortisol circadian rhythm is established by one month corrected age in preterm infants. Establishment of salivary cortisol circadian rhythm is related to gestational age rather than to postnatal age. Salivary cortisol circadian rhythm development is not related to behavioral regularity."
https://openalex.org/W2743399307,"The transmembrane emp24 domain/p24 (TMED) family are essential components of the vesicular transport machinery. Members of the TMED family serve as cargo receptors implicated in selection and packaging of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal proteins into coatomer (COP) II coated vesicles for anterograde transport to the Golgi. Deletion or mutations of Tmed genes in yeast and Drosophila results in ER-stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR leads to expression of genes and proteins important for expanding the folding capacity of the ER, degrading misfolded proteins, and reducing the load of new proteins entering the ER. The UPR is activated in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in human and mouse and may contribute to the development and the progression of NAFLD. Tmed2, the sole member of the vertebrate Tmed β subfamily, exhibits tissue and temporal specific patterns of expression in embryos and developing placenta but is ubiquitously expressed in all adult organs. We previously identified a single point mutation, the 99J mutation, in the signal sequence of Tmed2 in an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen. Histological and molecular analysis of livers from heterozygous mice carrying the 99J mutation, Tmed299J/+, revealed a requirement for TMED2 in liver health. We show that Tmed299J/+ mice had decreased levels of TMED2 and TMED10, dilated endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and increased phosphorylation of eIF2α, indicating ER-stress and activation of the UPR. Increased expression of Srebp1a and 2 at the newborn stage and increased incidence of NAFLD were also found in Tmed299J/+ mice. Our data establishes Tmed299J/+ mice as a novel mouse model for NAFLD and supports a role for TMED2 in liver health."
https://openalex.org/W2745106831,"A saturated analog of the cytochrome P450-mediated ω-3-17,18-epoxide of ω-3-eicosapentaenoic acid (C20E) activated apoptosis in human triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. This study evaluated the apoptotic mechanism of C20E. Increased cytosolic cytochrome c expression and altered expression of pro- and antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 proteins indicated activation of the mitochondrial pathway. Caspase-3 activation by C20E was prevented by pharmacological inhibition and silencing of the JNK and p38 MAP kinases (MAPK), upstream MAPK kinases MKK4 and MKK7, and the upstream MAPK kinase kinase apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). Silencing of the death receptor TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), but not Fas, DR4, or DR5, and the adapters TRADD and TNF receptor-associated factor 2, but not Fas-associated death domain, prevented C20E-mediated apoptosis. B-cell lymphoma-2 homology 3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid) cleavage by JNK/p38 MAPK linked the extrinsic and mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis. In further studies, an antibody against the extracellular domain of TNFR1 prevented apoptosis by TNF-α but not C20E. These findings suggest that C20E acts intracellularly at TNFR1 to activate ASK1-MKK4/7-JNK/p38 MAPK signaling and to promote Bid-dependent mitochondrial disruption and apoptosis. In in vivo studies, tumors isolated from C20E-treated nu/nu mice carrying MDA-MB-231 xenografts showed increased TUNEL staining and decreased Ki67 staining, reflecting increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation, respectively. ω-3-Epoxy fatty acids like C20E could be incorporated into treatments for triple-negative breast cancers.-Dyari, H.

https://openalex.org/W2744884288,"Human amniotic membrane extracts contain numerous growth factors and bioactive substances. However, osteogenic effects of amnion and chorion membrane extracts (AME and CME, respectively) on osteoblasts are unclear. In this study, we explored the ability of AME and CME to promote the osteogenic differentiation of osteoblast-like MG-63 cells. MG-63 cells were cultured in osteogenic induction medium (OIM) with or without exogenous AME and CME. CME enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of MG-63 cells compared with AME, as indicated by increased mineralization; alkaline phosphatase activity; and mRNA expression of osteogenic marker genes encoding integrin-binding sialoprotein (IBSP), RUNX2, OSTERIX, and osteocalcin (OCN). Interestingly, AME and CME contained different combinations of osteogenesis-related growth factors, including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFβ-1), and epidermal growth factor (EGF), which differentially regulated the osteogenic differentiation of MG-63 cells. bFGF and TGFβ-1 present in CME positively regulated the osteogenic differentiation of MG-63 cells, whereas EGF present in AME negatively regulated the differentiation of MG-63 cells. Moreover, exogenous treatment of EGF antagonized CME-induced mineralization of extracellular matrix on MG-63 cells. We compared the osteogenic efficacy of CME with that of BMP2, bFGF, and TGFβ-1 alone or their combinations. We observed that CME greatly enhanced osteogenesis by providing a conductive environment for the differentiation of MG-63 cells. Together, our results indicated that human AME and CME exerted differential effects on osteogenesis because of the presence of different compositions of growth factors. In addition, our results highlighted a new possible strategy of using CME as a biocompatible therapeutic material for bone regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2742751062,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive and currently incurable neurological disorder characterised by the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and the accumulation of aggregated alpha-synuclein (a-syn). Oligomeric a-syn is proposed to play a central role in spreading protein aggregation in the brain with associated cellular toxicity contributing to a progressive neurological decline. For this reason, a-syn oligomers have attracted interest as therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative conditions such as PD and other alpha-synucleinopathies. In addition to strategies using small molecules, neutralisation of the toxic oligomers by antibodies represents an attractive and highly specific strategy for reducing disease progression. Emerging active immunisation approaches using vaccines are already being trialled to induce such antibodies. Here we propose a novel vaccine based on the RNA bacteriophage (Qbeta) virus-like particle conjugated with short peptides of human a-syn. High titres of antibodies were successfully and safely generated in wild-type and human a-syn over-expressing (SNCA-OVX) transgenic mice following vaccination. Antibodies from vaccine candidates targeting the C-terminal regions of a-syn were able to recognise Lewy bodies, the hallmark aggregates in human PD brains. Furthermore, antibodies specifically targeted oligomeric and aggregated a-syn as they exhibited 100 times greater affinity for oligomeric species over monomer a-syn proteins in solution. In the SNCA-OVX transgenic mice used, vaccination was, however, unable to confer significant changes to oligomeric a-syn bioburden. Similarly, there was no discernible effect of vaccine treatment on behavioural phenotype as compared to control groups. Thus, antibodies specific for oligomeric a-syn induced by vaccination were unable to treat symptoms of PD in this particular mouse model."
https://openalex.org/W2743340486,"Bone's microporosity plays important roles in bone biology and bone mechanical quality. In this study, we explored the accuracy and reproducibility of nondestructive desktop μCT for 3D visualization and subsequent morphometric analysis of mouse cortical bone microporosity including the vascular canal network and osteocyte lacunae. The accuracy of measurements was evaluated in five murine fibula using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in conjunction with Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) staining as the reference method. The reproducibility of μCT-derived cortical bone microstructural indices was examined in 10 fibulae of C57Bl/6J male mice at a nominal resolution of 700 nanometer. Three repeated measurements were made on different days. An excellent correlation between μCT and CLSM was observed for both mean lacuna volume (r = 0.98, p = 0.002) and for mean lacuna orientation (r = 0.93, p = 0.02). Whereas the two techniques showed no significant differences for these parameters, the mean lacuna sphericity acquired from μCT was significantly higher than CLSM (p = 0.01). Reproducibility was high, with precision errors (PE) of 1.57-4.69% for lacuna parameters, and of 1.01-9.45% for vascular canal parameters. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) showed a high reliability of the measurements, ranging from 0.998-1.000 for cortical parameters, 0.973-0.999 for vascular canal parameters and 0.755-0.991 for lacuna parameters. In conclusion, desktop μCT is a valuable tool to quantify the 3D characteristics of bone vascular canals as well as lacunae which can be applied to intact murine bones with high accuracy and reproducibility. Thus, μCT might be an important tool to improve our understanding of the physiological and biomechanical significance of these cannular and lacunar structure in cortical bone."

This study was intended to evaluate the field accuracy of POC-CCA as a rapid test kit for schistosomiasis mapping in The Gambia.This prospective study was conducted in 4 regions in the country. Ten schools were randomly selected from each region, and a total of 2018 participants whose ages range from 7 to 14 years were enrolled in the study. Stool and urine samples were collected from each participant from May to June 2015, and tested for S. haematobium and S. mansoni infections in field and laboratory settings. The tests conducted included POC-CCA, double Kato-Katz slides, urine filtration and dipstick for hematuria.Of the 1954 participants that had complete data, the mean age of participants was 9.9 years. The prevalence of children infected with S. haematobium, using urine filtration technique was 10.1% (95% CI: 8.87-11.55). Central River Region had the highest level of urinary schistosomiasis with a prevalence of 28.0% (24.13-32.12).The lowest urinary schistosomiasis prevalence of 0.6% (0.12-1.86) was found in Lower River Region and North Bank Region had no cases of schistosomiasis detected. Only 5 participants were infected with S. mansoni. Using urine filtration as reference standard for the detection of S. haematobium, the sensitivity and specificity of POC-CCA was 47.7% and 75.8%. Whilst sensitivity and specificity of POC-CCA for detecting S. mansoni were 60.0% and 71.2% using double Kato-Katz as reference standard.This study showed lower sensitivity of POC-CCA in detecting S. haematobium. Therefore POC-CCA is less useful for rapid diagnosis of urinary schistosomiasis."
https://openalex.org/W2742862090,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common inherited muscular dystrophy. Patients experience DMD in their 20s from cardiac or respiratory failure related to progressive muscle wasting. Currently, the only treatments for the symptoms of DMD are available. Muscle fibrosis, a DMD feature, leads to reduced muscle function and muscle mass, and hampers pharmaceutical therapeutic efficacy. Although antifibrotic agents may be useful, none is currently approved. Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitors have exhibited antifibrotic effects in human and animal models. In this study, we showed beneficial effects of the PDE4 inhibitor piclamilast in the DMD mdx mouse. Piclamilast reduced the mRNA level of profibrotic genes, including collagen 1A1, in the gastrocnemius and diaphragm, in the mdx mouse, and significantly reduced the Sirius red staining area. The PDE5 inhibitors sildenafil and tadalafil ameliorated functional muscle ischemia in boys with DMD, and sildenafil reversed cardiac dysfunction in the mdx mouse. Single-treatment piclamilast or sildenafil showed similar antifibrotic effects on the gastrocnemius; combination therapy showed a potent antifibrotic effect, and piclamilast and combination therapy increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α mRNA in mouse gastrocnemius. In summary, we confirmed that piclamilast has significant antifibrotic effects in mdx mouse muscle and is a potential treatment for muscle fibrosis in DMD.-Nio, Y., Tanaka, M., Hirozane, Y., Muraki, Y., Okawara, M., Hazama, M., Matsuo, T.

https://openalex.org/W2743773387,"Nerve growth factor-β (NGF) is essential for the correct development of the nervous system. NGF exists in both a mature form and a pro-form (proNGF). The two forms have opposing effects on neurons: NGF induces proliferation, whereas proNGF induces apoptosis via binding to a receptor complex of the common neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) and sortilin. The overexpression of both proNGF and sortilin has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. Insights into the conformational differences between proNGF and NGF are central to a better understanding of the opposing mechanisms of action of NGF and proNGF on neurons. However, whereas the structure of NGF has been determined by X-ray crystallography, the structural details for proNGF remain elusive. Here, using a sensitive MS-based analytical method to measure the hydrogen/deuterium exchange of proteins in solution, we analyzed the conformational properties of proNGF and NGF. We detected the presence of a localized higher-order structure motif in the pro-part of proNGF. Furthermore, by comparing the hydrogen/deuterium exchange in the mature part of NGF and proNGF, we found that the presence of the pro-part in proNGF causes a structural stabilization of three loop regions in the mature part, possibly through a direct molecular interaction. Moreover, using tandem MS analyses, we identified two N-linked and two O-linked glycosylations in the pro-part of proNGF.

To be able to rationalize the diverse biological effect of proNGF and NGF and develop drugs targeting the proNGF-sortilin interaction, it is crucial to characterize the proteins involved at the molecular level.

It is a dimer under native conditions, and its structure is dominated by three anti-parallel β-strands and three intersecting disulfide bonds forming a so-called cysteine knot that tightly binds the protein together (Fig. 1) (18Kliemannel M.

These studies have described proNGF mainly at the global level, wherein the mature part of proNGF has been described as highly identical to NGF and the pro-part as highly flexible and dynamic, possibly with minor elements of structure. Finally, the pro-part of proNGF is known to be N-linked glycosylated, but the exact glycosylation sites and pattern have never been investigated thoroughly (4Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Pareek S.

The exchange rate can vary by 7 orders of magnitude for an amide hydrogen in disordered proteins (non-hydrogen-bonded) compared with an amide hydrogen in a structured protein (hydrogen-bonded). The usefulness of HDX-MS in investigating highly-disordered parts of proteins, such as the pro-part of proNGF, has been indicated by the mapping of structured and disordered regions of intrinsically disordered proteins (30Keppel T.R.

Furthermore, HDX-MS can be used to investigate subtle changes in the protein dynamics caused by protein-protein interactions and might thereby be used to detect any conformational impact of the molecular interactions between the pro-part and the mature part of proNGF (25Wales T.E.

Biol. 2011; 18: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this work, we used HDX-MS to study the conformation of proNGF and NGF. We show that the pro-part contains several O- and N-linked glycosylations and that the pro-part exhibits protection from HDX near the O-linked glycosites, identifying the presence of a transient and localized secondary/tertiary structure motif (e.g. a higher-order structure in which backbone amide hydrogens participate in hydrogen bonds). In conjunction, we show that the HDX of the mature part of the protein is directly impacted by the pro-part, in that several loops of NGF show reduced HDX when the pro-part remains attached to NGF. Based on these new findings, we have proposed a model for the conformational interplay between the ordered and disordered parts of the proNGF dimer regarding how the pro-part reduces the binding affinity of proNGF toward both TrkA and p75NTR compared with NGF. Full-length, glycosylated proNGF is inherently difficult to express and purify in eukaryotic host cells due to the presence of three protease (e.g. furin) cleavage sites in the pro-part (9Feng D.

To circumvent this challenge, most studies of proNGF thus far have been performed on nonglycosylated protein refolded following expression in Escherichia coli (5Paoletti F. Malerba F. Kelly G.

However, by the introduction of double mutations in the three protease cleavage sites, mouse proNGF has been expressed successfully in high and homogenous yield in insect cells (9Feng D. Kim T.

In the present study, we used this triple mutant approach and expressed human proNGF in Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells. To our knowledge this is the first time that full-length, glycosylated, human proNGF has been successfully expressed in a mammalian host organism and purified in yields suitable for detailed structural characterization. To investigate the glycosylation status of proNGF, an intact mass analysis of nontreated and PNGase F- and sialidase-treated proNGF was performed by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (Fig. 2, A and B). The observed mass shift in the mass spectrum of proNGF after treatment with PNGase F and sialidase corresponds to the removal of two biantennary complex glycans, clearly showing that proNGF contains two N-linked glycans. The most abundant form of the N-linked glycans is core-fucosylated and end-capped with a single sialic acid moity at each antenna (Fig. 2, A and B). Of the four peaks in the PNGase F- and sialidase-treated mass spectrum (Fig. 2B), only the peak with the lowest mass (peak 1: 25,762.7 Da) corresponds to the theoretical mass of proNGF including two Asn-to-Asp modifications (34Maley F. Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. Plummer T.H. Characterization of glycoproteins and their associated oligosaccharides through the use of endoglycosidases.Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Thus, proNGF exists as four different species even after enzymatic removal of the two N-linked glycans. Interestingly, the mass difference between these species of proNGF correlated with sugar moieties, indicating the presence of further glycosylations not cleavable by PNGase F and sialidase. The heterogeneity of proNGF disappeared after further O-glycosidase treatment, confirming the presence of O-linked glycans (Fig. 2, B and C) (35Iwase H. Hotta K. Release of O-linked glycoprotein glycans by endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase.Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 14: 151-159PubMed Google Scholar). From the intact mass analysis of proNGF, it can be estimated that 12% of proNGF is not O-linked glycosylated, whereas the rest of the protein population (88%) contains from one up to three O-linked glycosylations (Fig. 2B). The O-linked glycans most likely consist of one N-acetylgalactosamine, one galactose, and either one or two sialic acid entities (supplemental Fig. S1), as the biosynthesis of O-glycans containing multiple sugar moieties is most commonly initiated by the attachment of an α-linked N-acetylgalactosamine followed by the attachment of a galactose entity (36Gill D.J.

Furthermore, the identified types of O-glycosylations are similar to the ones reported previously for CHO cells (38North S.J. Huang H.H. Sundaram S. Jang-Lee J. Etienne A.T. Trollope A. Chalabi S.

To map the N-glycosylation sites on proNGF, a tryptic digestion of untreated and PNGase F-treated proNGF was performed, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by reverse-phase ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) ESI tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). A conventional peptide search algorithm (not able to identify glycopeptides) was used to identify tryptic peptides. The resulting sequence coverage map from the nontreated sample contained two regions without sequence coverage in the pro-part of proNGF: Val−59–Arg−47 and Val−35–Arg−4 (supplemental Fig. S2). These two regions, containing an N-linked consensus motif at Asn−53 and Asn−8, were covered by peptides in the PNGase F-treated sample (taking into account a single Asn–Asp conversion in each peptide) indicating the presence of an N-linked glycan at both Asn−53 and Asn−8 (34Maley F.

However, the roles of GNB2L1 in chemoresistance of gastric cancer has never been determined. In the present study, we found that GNB2L1 was downregulated in chemoresistant patients of gastric cancer, and observed the decrease of GNB2L1 in protein levels instead of mRNA levels in different chemoresistant gastric cancer cell lines. Further we proved that this downregulation of GNB2L1 was resulted from its elevated O-GlcNAcylation catalyzed by OGT in both cell lines and patients. Next, we investigate the function of GNB2L1 and its O-GlcNAcylation on gastric cancer metastasis during chemoresistance, and confirmed Ser124 as the major O-GlcNAcylation site on GNB2L1 that regulated its function on metastasis. Furthermore, our data demonstrated that GNB2L1 modulated EMT via regulating the translation of EMT-related proteins in the process of chemoresistance. In summary, this study indicated that GNB2L1 and its O-GlcNAcylation regulated metastasis via modulating the translation of EMT-related proteins in the chemoresistance of gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2742774039,"The ploidy of eukaryote gametes must be halved to avoid doubling of numbers of chromosomes with each generation and this is carried out by meiosis, a specialized cell division in which a single chromosomal replication phase is followed by two successive nuclear divisions. With some exceptions, programmed recombination ensures the proper pairing and distribution of homologous pairs of chromosomes in meiosis and recombination defects thus lead to sterility. Two highly related recombinases are required to catalyse the key strand-invasion step of meiotic recombination and it is the meiosis-specific DMC1 which is generally believed to catalyse the essential non-sister chromatid crossing-over, with RAD51 catalysing sister-chromatid and non-cross-over events. Recent work in yeast and plants has however shown that in the absence of RAD51 strand-exchange activity, DMC1 is able to repair all meiotic DNA breaks and surprisingly, that this does not appear to affect numbers of meiotic cross-overs. In this work we confirm and extend this conclusion. Given that more than 95% of meiotic homologous recombination in Arabidopsis does not result in inter-homologue crossovers, Arabidopsis is a particularly sensitive model for testing the relative importance of the two proteins—even minor effects on the non-crossover event population should produce detectable effects on crossing-over. Although the presence of RAD51 protein provides essential support for the action of DMC1, our results show no significant effect of the absence of RAD51 strand-exchange activity on meiotic crossing-over rates or patterns in different chromosomal regions or across the whole genome of Arabidopsis, strongly supporting the argument that DMC1 catalyses repair of all meiotic DNA breaks, not only non-sister cross-overs."
https://openalex.org/W2744775542,"Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is the leading sexually transmitted bacterial infection. The continued global burden of CT infection strongly predicates the need for a vaccine to supplement current chlamydial control programs. The correlates of protection against CT are currently unknown, but they must be carefully defined to guide vaccine design. The localized nature of chlamydial infection in columnar epithelial cells of the genital tract necessitates investigation of immunity at the site of infection. The purpose of this study was to develop a sensitive whole bacterial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to quantify and compare CT-specific IgG and IgA in sera and genital secretions from CT-infected women. To achieve this, elementary bodies (EBs) from two of the most common genital serovars (D and E) were attached to poly-L-lysine-coated microtiter plates with glutaraldehyde. EB attachment and integrity were verified by the presence of outer membrane antigens and the absence of bacterial cytoplasmic antigens. EB-specific IgG and IgA standards were developed by pooling sera with high titers of CT-specific antibodies from infected women. Serum, endocervical and vaginal secretions, and endocervical cytobrush specimens from CT-infected women were used to quantify CT-specific IgG and IgA which were then normalized to total IgG and IgA, respectively. Analyses of paired serum and genital samples revealed significantly higher proportions of EB-specific antibodies in genital secretions compared to sera. Cervical and vaginal secretions and cytobrush specimens had similar proportions of EB-specific antibodies, suggesting any one of these genital sampling techniques could be used to quantify CT-specific antibodies when appropriate normalization methodologies are implemented. Overall, these results illustrate the need to investigate genital tract CT antibody responses, and our assay provides a useful quantitative tool to assess natural immunity in defined clinical groups and CT vaccine trials."

Combination of site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiology is a powerful tool to pinpoint the key amino-acid residues in the receptor ligand-binding site, but for α7 and α9 nAChRs it is complicated by their poor expression and fast desensitization. Here, we probed the ligand-binding properties of α7/α9 nAChR mutants by a proposed simple and fast calcium imaging method. The method is based on transient co-expression of α7/α9 nAChR mutants in neuroblastoma cells together with Ric-3 or NACHO chaperones and Case12 fluorescent calcium ion sensor followed by analysis of their pharmacology using a fluorescence microscope or a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR) with a GFP filter set. The results obtained were confirmed by electrophysiology and by calcium imaging with the conventional calcium indicator Fluo-4. The affinities for acetylcholine and epibatidine were determined for human and rat α7 nAChRs, and for their mutants with homologous residues of α9 nAChR incorporated at positions 117-119, 184, 185, 187, and 189, which are anticipated to be involved in ligand binding. The strongest decrease in the affinity was observed for mutations at positions 187 and 119. The L119D mutation of α7 nAChR, showing a larger effect for epibatidine than for acetylcholine, may implicate this position in pharmacological differences between α7 and α9 nAChRs."
https://openalex.org/W2742328940,"Neointimal hyperplasia is the main cause of restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs). Both IFN-γ and macrophages play nonredundant roles in the pathogenesis of vascular intimal hyperplasia; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive and must be further investigated. In mouse peritoneal macrophages, IFN-γ significantly accelerated degradation and up-regulated polyubiquitination of liver X receptor (LXR)-α. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) inhibitor, fludarabine, and PIAS1 knockdown reduced ubiquitination and increased the expression of LXR-α in IFN-γ-treated macrophages. IFN-γ also increased the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related proteins, including p-PERK, p-eIIF2α, and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), as well as apoptosis of macrophages. Treatment with ER stress inhibitor, 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), and LXR agonist, T0901317 (T0), alleviated IFN-γ-induced apoptosis in macrophages. Neointimal hyperplasia was significant after carotid ligation for 4 wk in ApoE-/- mice. IFN-γ mAb, T0, and 4-PBA treatment not only significantly attenuated neointimal hyperplasia but also decreased CD68+TUNEL+ double-positive macrophages in the hyperplastic neointima. Moreover, after 4-PBA or T0 administration, the number of CD68+p-eIIF2α+ and CD68+CHOP+ double-positive cells in neointimal was also apparently decreased. Taken together, these results defined an unexpected role of IFN-γ and LXR-α in the development of neointimal hyperplasia. The PIAS1/STAT1-dependent LXR-α degradation induced by IFN-γ promoted ER stress and apoptosis in macrophages, which leads to aggravated neointimal hyperplasia. LXR agonist efficiently improved neointimal hyperplasia, which may be a promising new strategy to ameliorate restenosis and vascular remodeling after PCI.-Zhao, Q., Zhou, D., You, H., Lou, B., Zhang, Y., Tian, Y., Guo, N., Chen, X., Liu, Y., Wu, Y., Yuan, Z., Zhou, J.

Finding a sustainable strategy in wood protection has become of great interest among researchers. The objective of these in vitro studies was to demonstrate the effect of T-720-enriched organic charcoal (biochar) against five wood decay basidiomycetes isolated from strongly damaged poles. For this purpose, the antagonistic potential of Trichoderma harzianum (strain T-720) was confirmed among other four Trichoderma spp. against five brown-rot basidiomycetes in dual culture tests. T-720 was genetically transformed and tagged with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in order to study its antagonistic mechanism against wood decay basidiomycetes. It was also demonstrated that T-720 inhibits the oxalic acid production by basidiomycetes, a well-known mechanism used by brown-rot fungi to detoxify Cu from impregnated wood. Additionally, this study evaluated the effect of biochar, alone or in combination with T-720, on Cu leaching by different preservatives, pH stabilization and prevention of wood decay caused by five basidiomycetes. Addition of biochar resulted in a significant Cu binding released from impregnated wood specimens. T-720-enriched biochar showed a significant reduction of wood decay caused by four basidiomycetes. The addition of T-720-enriched biochar to the soil into which utility poles are placed may improve the efficiency of Cr-free wood preservatives."
https://openalex.org/W2742507153,"Objective Place of birth is a known determinant of health care outcomes, interventions and costs. Many studies have examined the maternal and perinatal outcomes when women plan to give birth in hospitals compared with births in birth centres or at home. However, these studies vary substantially in rigour; assessing their quality is challenging. Existing research appraisal tools do not always capture important elements of study design that are critical when comparing outcomes by planned place of birth. To address this deficiency, we aimed to develop a reliable instrument to rate the quality of primary research on maternal and newborn outcomes by place of birth. Study design The instrument development process involved five phases: 1) generation of items and a weighted scoring system; 2) content validation via a quantitative survey and a modified Delphi process with an international, multi-disciplinary panel of experts; 3) inter-rater consistency; 4) alignment with established research appraisal tools; and 5) pilot-testing of instrument usability. Results A Birth Place Research Quality Index (ResQu Index) was developed comprising 27 scored items that are summed to generate a weighted composite score out of 100 for studies comparing planned place of birth. Scale content validation indices were .89 for clarity, .94 for relevance and .90 for importance. The Index demonstrated substantial inter-rater consistency; pilot-testing confirmed feasibility and user-friendliness. Conclusion The ResQu Index is a reliable instrument to evaluate the quality of design, methods and interpretation of reported outcomes from research about place of birth. Higher-scoring studies have greater potential to inform evidence-based selection of birth place by clinicians, policy makers, and women and their families. The Index can also guide the design of future research on place of birth."
https://openalex.org/W2743775961,"Background To evaluate the clinical characteristics, treatment-related toxicities and survival in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with or without oropharyngealcandidiasis (OPC) during radiotherapy. Methods The current study was conducted with NPC patients undergoing radiotherapy at Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center between June 2011 and May 2012. A clinical diagnosis of candidiasis was determined on the basis of a positive potassium hydroxide (KOH) test and the presence of pseudomembranous (white) form of candidal overgrowth. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to test the association of OPC and related survival rates. Results Compared with the non-OPC group, the OPC group had significantly increased occurrence rates of grade 3–4 mucositis (14.5% vs. 7.4%, P = 0.049), anaemia (11.3% vs. 4.4%, P = 0.020), hepatotoxicity (4.8% vs. 1.1%, P = 0.021) and critical weight loss (85.5% vs. 56.6%, P<0.001) during radiotherapy. The OPC group had a significantly lower disease-free survival (DFS) (70.9% vs. 82.6%, P = 0.012), mainly as a result of a reduction in locoregional relapse-free survival (LRFS) (87.0%vs. 94.9%, P = 0.025). After stratification by T stage, the 5-year DFS in T3-4 patients were 82.0% and 68.8% in non-OPC and OPC groups, respectively (P = 0.022). Multivariate analyses indicated that OPC was a prognostic factor for LRFS and DFS. Conclusions OPC during radiotherapy may worsen the nutritional status of NPC patients according to weight loss and anaemia, leading to a negative impact on 5-year locoregional relapse-free survival and disease-specific survival. Further investigations are needed to explore whether prevention and treatment of OPC during radiotherapy will be useful."

With a single drop of blood taken from a finger prick, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can diagnose malaria accurately and almost instantly, and the test is so easy to use that volunteers from local communities in remote villages across Africa and Asia now commonly deploy it. Until RDTs became widespread, almost all fevers were treated as if they were malaria, leading to the overuse of the new generation of wonder drugs, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), which were in danger of being lost to drug resistance. Now, with accurate diagnosis, ACTs can be targeted to those who need them, and the hope has been that patients who don’t have malaria would be treated for the true cause of their fever. But now a huge new study suggests that, along its enormous benefits, the rollout of RDTs has had some unintended—and undesirable—consequences: overprescription of antibiotics, which can exacerbate the rapid rise in antibiotic-resistant infections. What’s more, some patients who did not have malaria were given ACTs anyway, and more troubling, some with malaria were not, leaving them at risk of severe disease or death."
