https://openalex.org/W2010014302,"A glassy fulgurite, formed recently on a morainal ridge in southeastern Michigan, contains micrometer- to centimeter-sized metallic globules rich in native silicon, which unmixed from a silica-rich liquid. The unusual character of these globules and their potential for elucidating conditions of fulgurite formation prompted further study. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that temperatures in excess of 2000 K and reducing conditions approaching those of the SiO(2)-Si buffer were needed to form the coexisting metallic and silicate liquids. The phases produced are among the most highly reduced naturally occurring materials known. Some occurrences of other highly reduced minerals may also be due to lightning strike reduction. Extreme reduction and volatilization may also occur during high-temperature events such as lightning strikes in presolar nebulae and impacts of extraterrestrial bodies. As a result of scavenging of platinum-group elements by highly reduced metallic liquids, geochemical anomalies associated with the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary may have a significant terrestrial component even if produced through bolide impact."
https://openalex.org/W1981677106,"An orbiting spacecraft and ground observatories have been used to obtain interferometric observations of cosmic radio sources. The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) was used as the orbiting observatory in conjunction with two 64- meter radio telescopes at ground observatories, one in Australia and one in Japan. The quasars 1730-130 (NRAO 530), 1510-089, and 1741-038 were observed at a frequency of 2.3 gigahertz, and a maximum projected baseline of 1.4 earth diameters was achieved. All quasar observations for which valid data were acquired resulted in detected fringes. Many of the techniques proposed for a dedicated very long baseline interferometry observatory in space were used successfully in this experiment."
https://openalex.org/W1981692394,"Traditionally, economics has been considered a nonexperimental science. In the last quarter century experimental methods have become a growing part of the economist's effort to more fully understand how individual motivation, individual information, and exchange rules relate to market outcomes in different institutions. Empirical support has been found in a wide variety of different experiments for the theoretical proposition that markets serve to aggregate the dispersed information of individuals to produce wealth-creating outcomes for society. A number of different experiments are presented to illustrate the type of questions addressed, including some in which the process is governed by political institutions such as majority rule."
https://openalex.org/W2044631200,"Fossil fishes from the Miocene La Venta fauna of the Magdalena River Valley, Colombia, are identified as Colossoma macropomum (Characidae), a living species from the Orinoco and Amazon basins. The fossils document a long and conservative history for a species that is highly specialized for feeding on streamside plants. The phylogenetically advanced position of Colossoma in the subfamily Serrasalminae implies that six related genera and other higher characid taxa originated well before 15 million years ago. This discovery also corroborates neontological evidence for a vicariance event that contributed species from Miocene Orinoco-Amazon faunas to the original Magdalena region fauna. The fossils suggest a formerly diverse Magdalena fauna that has suffered local extinction, perhaps associated with late Cenozoic tectonism. This new evidence may help explain the depauperate nature of the modern Magdalena River."
https://openalex.org/W2025444036,"The self-mobile maize transposable element Ac (Activator) displays two trans-acting genetic functions: it induces transposition of the element Ds (Dissociation) but, as its dosage is increased, it also inhibits transposition. Previous work has shown that the 4563 base pair (bp)-long Ac element contains three open reading frames (ORF's) and that a deletion in ORF 1 in wx-m9(Ds), a Ds derivative from Ac isolated at the wx (waxy) locus, results in loss of transposition. The Ds element in the bronze allele bz-m2(DI) is shown to have arisen from Ac by a 1312-bp deletion that is located almost entirely within ORF 2 and does not affect ORF 1. The Ds elements in wx-m9(Ds) and bzm2(DI), defective in ORF 1 and ORF 2, respectively, do not complement genetically to restore the transposition function of Ac; therefore, this function must be specified jointly by ORF's 1 and 2. Furthermore, since bz-m2(DI) does not contribute to Ac's inhibitory dosage effect, both Ac properties result from the expression of the same genetic functional unit."

https://openalex.org/W2000181050,"In the quarter century since the first optical identification of a ""radio star"" (3C 48), astronomers have come to general agreement that the underlying quasar energy source is accretion onto a massive black hole. There is much less agreement on the detailed physics of the processes by which this energy is converted to the forms observed, but this has not prevented the objects from serving as valuable probes of the universe at distant times and places."
