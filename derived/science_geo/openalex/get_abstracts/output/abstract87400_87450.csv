https://openalex.org/W1967582134,"Escherichia coli K-12 acquired the ability to produce a high titer of Shiga-like toxin after lysogenization by either of two different bacteriophages isolated from a highly toxinogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain that causes hemorrhagic colitis. One of these phages and another Shiga-like toxin-converting phage from an Escherichia coli O26 isolate associated with infantile diarrhea were closely related in terms of morphology, virion polypeptides, DNA restriction fragments, lysogenic immunity, and heat stability, although a difference in host range was noted. These phages are currently the best-characterized representatives from a broader family of Shiga-like toxin-converting phages."
https://openalex.org/W2030456541,"By recombinant DNA techniques, a disulfide bond was introduced at a specific site in T4 lysozyme, a disulfide-free enzyme. This derivative retained full enzymatic activity and was more stable toward thermal inactivation than the wild-type protein. The derivative, T4 lysozyme (Ile3 → Cys), was prepared by substituting a Cys codon for an Ile codon at position 3 in the cloned lysozyme gene by means of oligonucleotide-dependent, site-directed mutagenesis. The new gene was expressed in Escherichia coli under control of the (trp-lac) hybrid tac promoter, and the protein was purified. Mild oxidation generated a disulfide bond between the new Cys3 and Cys97, one of the two unpaired cysteines of the native molecule. Oxidized T4 lysozyme (Ile3 → Cys) exhibited specific activity identical to that of the wild-type enzyme when measured at 20°C in a cell-clearing assay. The cross-linked protein was more stable than the wild type during incubation at elevated temperatures as determined by recovered enzymatic activity at 20°C."
https://openalex.org/W1568982528,"The biochemical events underlying the ability of thrombin to enhance the metabolism of inositol phospholipids in human platelets have been investigated using platelets prelabeled with [3H]inositol. Thrombin treatment caused rapid formation of radioactive inositol monophosphate (IP), inositol bisphosphate (IP2), and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) with less marked and more variable changes in the levels of radioactive inositol phospholipids. Formation of IP2 and IP3 could be detected 5 s after exposure to thrombin and before IP levels increased. Low doses of thrombin which produced only shape change in human platelets also caused significant formation of IP2 and IP3 but not IP. These results suggest that thrombin-induced platelet activation may be mediated through hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides. The majority of IP formed presumably arises from the hydrolysis of IP2. Prostacyclin inhibited thrombin-induced formation of all three inositol phosphates."

https://openalex.org/W1563608944,"It has been documented that streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats is associated with diminished effects of insulin despite increased insulin binding to its receptor. This paradox led us to examine whether any alterations of insulin receptor-kinase activities occur in this type of insulin resistance. Insulin binding capacity/mg of protein of solubilized, wheat germ agglutinin-purified preparations from livers was increased by 1.8-fold in the streptozotocin (65 mg/kg) diabetic rats. This increase was associated with a parallel increase in receptor protein as measured by an immunoblotting method using anti-insulin receptor antibody. Moreover, no apparent change was observed in the stoichiometry of alpha and beta subunits of the insulin receptor between diabetic and control rats. Insulin-stimulated (10(-7) M) phosphorylation of the beta subunit of the insulin receptor was decreased by 40% in diabetic rats when equal quantities of insulin binding capacity were compared. Phosphorylation of an exogenously added synthetic peptide (similar in sequence to the tyrosine phosphorylation site in pp60src) by the insulin receptor-kinase was also decreased by 25% in diabetic rats. These abnormalities were partially restored by in vivo insulin treatment. These data suggest that diminished insulin receptor autophosphorylation and kinase activity could provide a possible mechanism for the post-binding insulin resistance in diabetic rats."
https://openalex.org/W2051140578,"Clonidine, an α-2-adrenergic agonist, significantly reduces opiate withdrawal. Fifteen heavy smokers abstained from cigarettes on three separate occasions and received instead clonidine, placebo, or the benzodiazepine alprazolam. Clonidine and alprazolam diminished withdrawal symptoms. The two drugs suppressed anxiety, tension, irritability, and restlessness equally but clonidine had a greater effect than alprazolam on cigarette craving. These observations suggest that noradrenergic activity is a common feature in the pathophysiology of withdrawal and that a special relationship exists between central noradrenergic activity and craving."
https://openalex.org/W1580692821,"Light induction of light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (LHCP) mRNA accumulation was studied in light-dark synchronized cultures of Chlamydomonas reinhardi. LHCP mRNA accumulation was prevented by the chlorophyll-synthesis inhibitor alpha,alpha-dipyridyl which blocks late steps in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway and leads to the accumulation of the porphyrin intermediate magnesium protoporphyrin methyl ester. LHCP mRNA accumulated normally, however, when chlorophyll synthesis was blocked by inhibitors such as hemin and levulinic acid which interfere with early steps in the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway prior to the formation of magnesium protoporphyrin methyl ester. Similar effects were observed in the light induction of LHCP mRNA levels in protoporphyrin IX-accumulating mutants, brc-1 and brs-1. These mutants have low levels of LHCP mRNA when grown under heterotrophic conditions in the dark where they accumulate protoporphyrin IX. However, LHCP mRNA is light-induced in brc-1 which synthesizes chlorophyll in the light and presumably consumes porphyrin intermediates in doing so. These results suggest that the chlorophyll-synthesis intermediates, magnesium protoporphyrin methyl ester and its immediate precursors, inhibit by a feedback mechanism the light induction of LHCP mRNA accumulation. Low magnesium protoporphyrin methyl ester levels permit the light-induced accumulation of LHCP mRNA, whereas high magnesium protoporphyrin methyl ester levels destabilize LHCP mRNA regardless of the illumination conditions. Preliminary experiments show that LHCP mRNA accumulation in C. reinhardi is stimulated by blue light, and not by red light which stimulates LHCP mRNA accumulation in higher plants."

https://openalex.org/W1502584715,"Recent studies of chloroplast architecture have emphasized the segregation of photosystem I and photosystem II in different regions of the lamellar membrane. The apparent localization of photosystem II reaction centers in regions of membrane appression and of photosystem I reaction centers in regions exposed to the chloroplast stroma has focused attention on the intervening electron carriers, carriers which must be present to catalyze electron transfer between such spatially separated reaction sites. Information regarding the stoichiometries of these intermediate carriers is essential to an understanding of the processes that work together to establish the mechanism and to determine the rate of the overall process. We have reinvestigated the numbers of photosystem I and photosystem II reaction centers, the numbers of intervening cytochrome b6/f complexes, and the numbers of molecules of the relatively mobile electron carriers plastoquinone and plastocyanin that are actively involved in electron transfer. Our investigations were based on a new experimental technique made possible by the use of a modified indophenol dye, methyl purple, the reduction of which provides a particularly sensitive and accurate measure of electron transfer. Using this dye, which accepts electrons exclusively from photosystem I, it was possible to drain electrons from each of the carriers. Thus, by manipulation of the redox condition of the various carriers and through the use of specific inhibitors we could measure the electron storage capacity of each carrier in turn. We conclude that the ratio of photosystem I reaction centers to cytochrome b6/f complexes to photosystem II reaction centers is very nearly 1:1:1. The pool of rapid donors of electrons to P700 includes not only the 2 reducing equivalents stored in the cytochrome b6/f complex but also those stored in slightly more than 2 molecules of plastocyanin per P700. More slowly available are the electrons from about 6 plastoquinol molecules per P700."
https://openalex.org/W1519389642,"The interdependence of the activities of point enzymes which compete for a common substrate can yield ultrasensitivity or subsensitivity to control, even if the competing enzymes follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The nature of this branch point for a particular system depends on the kinetic parameters of the competing enzymes, the rate of substrate production leading into the point and the type of regulatory mechanism involved. With physiologically reasonable parameter values, the point effect can give ultrasensitivity equivalent to an allosteric enzyme with a Hill coefficient of 8 or higher. An experimental example of this ultrasensitivity was provided by the point between isocitrate lyase (of the glyoxylate bypass) and isocitrate dehydrogenase in Escherichia coli. The glyoxylate bypass is very active during growth on acetate but its flux decreases by a factor of approximately 150 upon addition of glucose. This inhibition is brought about by two relatively modest events: a 4-fold increase in the maximum velocity of isocitrate dehydrogenase and a factor of 5.5 decrease in the rate of isocitrate production. The mechanism which underlies this sensitivity amplification is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1484955319,"The effect of vanadium oxides on living systems may involve the in vivo conversion of vanadate and vanadyl ions. The addition of 5 mM orthovanadate (VO4(3-), V(V)), a known inhibitor of the (Na,K)-ATPase, to yeast cells stopped growth. In contrast, the addition of 5 mM vanadyl (VO2+, V(IV) stimulated growth. Orthovanadate addition to whole cells is known to stimulate various cellular processes. In yeast, both ions inhibited the plasma membrane Mg2+ ATPase and were transported into the cell as demonstrated with [48V]VO4(3-) and VO2+. ESR spectroscopy has been used to measure the cell-associated paramagnetic vandyl ion, while 51V NMR has detected cell-associated diamagnetic vanadium (e.g. V(V)). Cells were exposed to both toxic (5 mM) and nontoxic (1 mM) concentrations of vanadate in the culture medium. ESR showed that under both conditions, vanadate became cell associated and was converted to vanadyl which then accumulated in the cell culture medium. 51V NMR studies showed the accumulation of new cell-associated vanadium resonances identified as dimeric vanadate and decavanadate in cells exposed to toxic amounts of medium vanadate (5 mM). These vanadate compounds did not accumulate in cells exposed to 1 mM vanadate. These studies confirm that the inhibitory form of vanadium usually observed in in vitro experiments is vanadate, in one or more of its hydrated forms. These data also support the hypothesis that the stimulatory form of vanadium usually observed in whole cell experiments is the vanadyl ion or one or more of its liganded derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W1589784623,"Monoclonal antibodies were used to study the structure and the biosynthesis of the rabbit progesterone receptor. Proteins in nonfractionated uterine cytosol were submitted to gel electrophoresis in denaturing conditions, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and reacted with monoclonal antireceptor antibodies and 125I-protein A. A single 110,000-dalton protein was observed when precautions were taken during homogenization of the uteri and protease inhibitors used. Smaller forms of receptor (essentially of 79,000 daltons but also of 72,000 and in some experiments of 64,000 daltons) were present when these precautions were not observed and thus probably arose from artifactual proteolysis of receptor. When poly(A)+ RNA from rabbit uterus was translated in a reticulocyte lysate and the radioactive proteins precipitated by the antireceptor monoclonal antibodies, a radioactive protein of 110,000 daltons was also observed. Further evidence that this protein was the product of the translation of progesterone receptor mRNA was obtained by precipitation and immunoaffinity purification with several antireceptor monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, inhibition of immunoprecipitation by purified receptor and its absence in a receptor-poor tissue (liver). Estrogen treatment is known to increase the concentration of progesterone receptor. RNA translation experiments showed that this effect is due to an increase in the concentration of receptor mRNA. The size of this messenger RNA was studied by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, followed by mRNA translation, and specific immunoprecipitation: progesterone receptor mRNA was found by this method to sediment at 20 S."
https://openalex.org/W1582754984,"Dual enzyme activities for the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan of the cell wall are located in major higher molecular weight penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) of Escherichia coli. Each of these proteins catalyzes the two successive final reactions in the synthesis of cross-linked peptidoglycan from the precursor N-acetylglucosaminyl-N-acetylmuramyl peptide linked to undecaprenol diphosphate; namely, the transglycosylation that extends the glycan chain and the penicillin-sensitive DD-transpeptidation that cross-links the glycan chains through two peptide side chains. Both transglycosylation and transpeptidation catalyzed by PBP-1Bs represent de novo synthesis of cross-linked peptidoglycan. Under appropriate conditions, about 25% cross-linkage was observed during the reaction, the main reaction product supposedly being a regularly cross-linked network of peptidoglycan. The two domains for the transglycosylase and transpeptidase activities were found to be located on a 50-kDa portion of the PBP-1Bs, which are about 90 kDa. Gene recombination experiments indicated that the transglycosylase domain is located upstream, i.e. on the N-terminal side of the transpeptidase domain, suggesting that the gene for these bifunctional peptides may have been formed by fusion of the genes for transglycosylase and transpeptidase that were previously located separately on the chromosome in this order."
https://openalex.org/W2052139085,"The plasma desorption mass spectrometry method is used to determine the molecular weights of larger molecules than before, to determine the molecular weights of proteins and peptides in mixtures, and to monitor protein modification reactions. Proteins up to molecular weight 25,000 can now be studied with a mass spectrometric technique. Protein-peptide mixtures that could not be resolved with conventional techniques were successfully analyzed by this technique. The precision of the method is good enough to permit one to follow the different steps in the conversion of porcine insulin to human insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1584906806,"The amino acid sequence has been determined for the insecticyanin from the hemolymph of the fifth instar larvae of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. The apoprotein is a single polypeptide chain of 189 amino acids, molecular weight 21,378, containing two disulfide bridges, 9-119 and 42-176. The sequence analysis was performed by automated Edman degradation of reduced and carboxymethylated insecticyanin and fragments generated therefrom by cyanogen bromide, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and Staphylococcus aureus proteinase. Most of the peptides were purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. A purification procedure for the isolation of insecticyanin in high yields and a simple method of determining disulfide linkages are also reported."

https://openalex.org/W1558755669,"The mechanism of insulin action on glucose transport in rat hearts was studied. The glucose transport activity was determined after reconstitution into egg lecithin liposomes. Isolated rat hearts were perfused in the presence or absence of insulin and homogenized. The homogenate was fractionated by differential and sucrose density gradient centrifugations. Two subcellular fractions, designated as Fractions P-5 and P-6, contained glucose transport activity. Both fractions were enriched with 5'-nucleotidase (commonly known as a plasma membrane marker) and UDP-Gal:N-acetylglucosamine galactosyltransferase (known as a Golgi marker). However, only Fraction P-5 was concentrated with the insulin receptor and ouabain-sensitive p-nitrophenylphosphatase (both plasma membrane markers). The sedimentation properties of the glucose transport activity in Fraction P-6 were considerably different from those of galactosyltransferase. Insulin added to the heart before homogenization increased the glucose transport activity in Fraction P-5 approximately 1.6-fold while decreasing the activity in Fraction P-6 to approximately 62% of the control. These results are interpreted as follows. Both Fractions P-5 and P-6 are heterogeneous; nevertheless, Fraction P-5, but not Fraction P-6, may be enriched with the plasma membrane, which is assumed to be associated with glucose transport activity. Fraction P-6 may be concentrated with the Golgi apparatus; however, the latter may not be the structure (or vesicles) to which (intracellular) glucose transport activity is associated. Insulin appears to increase the glucose transport activity in rat hearts, at least in part, by inducing translocation of the glucose transport mechanism from the unidentified vesicles (in Fraction P-6) to the plasma membrane (in Fraction P-5)."
https://openalex.org/W1520440413,"Iron, particularly in the ferrous state plays a role in regulating the biosynthesis of the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in Escherichia coli B. Addition of iron has a repressive effect on the synthesis of MnSOD under normal or inducing conditions (i.e. in the presence of paraquat). Addition of manganese to cultures already depressed for MnSOD biosynthesis causes a further increase in the amount of active enzyme, however, this effect is also abolished by the addition of iron. Removal of metals from the growth medium by Chelex 100 also derepresses the synthesis of MnSOD but repletion of the medium with iron abolishes this effect. Chelators specific for Fe2+, 2,2'-dipyridyl, and 1,10-phenanthroline, cause a 5-7-fold increase in MnSOD. Removal of iron also increases the synthesis of MnSOD in the absence of oxygen. A model is presented to account for the observed effects of oxygen, superoxide anion, and chelators on the increased synthesis of MnSOD. In this model, the regulatory repressor for MnSOD biosynthesis is envisioned as being an iron-containing protein."
https://openalex.org/W1550123379,"The release of Zn2+ from aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase; c6r6) upon challenge by p-hydroxymercuriphenylsulfonate (PMPS) has been studied using the sensitive, high-affinity metallochromic indicator 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol at pH 7.0. When the–SH group of each catalytic (c) chain is protected, 1 Zn2+ is released for every 4 eq of PMPS added to ATCase during titration of the 24–SH groups of regulatory (r) chains. Moreover, the release of Zn2+ is a linear function of PMPS added, indicating that the rate-limiting step in Zn2+ release is mercurial attack on the 1st of the 4 r–SH groups bonded tetrahedrally to Zn2+ in an r chain near c:r contacts. Dissociation of ATCase is linked to Zn2+ release and mercaptide formation; e.g. upon addition of 4 eq of PMPS to ATCase in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (Hepes) buffer, 1/6th of ATCase is dissociated to c3 and r2 subunits at approximately 83% of the rate of Zn2+ release, with no accumulation of the c6r4 intermediate as is observed in KPO4 buffer. Adding less than or equal to 4 PMPS/ATCase, the release of Zn2+ is first-order in [PMPS] and is virtually independent of [ATCase] with an activation energy of 18 kcal/mol. With large excesses of PMPS, stopped-flow traces show a lag period followed by pseudo first-order release of Zn2+ from ATCase and the reaction order in [PMPS] = approximately 1.3. Under these conditions, PMPS has a chaotropic effect on ATCase; the activation energy for Zn2+ release is much lower than that obtained with limiting PMPS and is increased by the presence of phosphate or active-site ligand from 6.6 to approximately 12 kcal/mol. A reasonable explanation of the observed kinetic data is that the organomercurial reagent binds reversibly to nitrogenous side chain groups in an ATCase molecule prior to the rate-limiting reaction with a sulfhydryl group."
https://openalex.org/W1552469573,"By in vitro recombination we have constructed hybrid plasmids which can suppress the increased methylmethane sulfonate sensitivity caused by the alkA1 mutation in Escherichia coli. Since the cloned DNA fragment was mapped at 44 to 45 min of the E. coli K12 genetic map, an area where the alkA gene is located, we conclude that the cloned DNA fragment contains the alkA gene itself but not other gene(s) that suppresses the alkA mutation. Specific labeling of plasmid-encoded proteins by the maxicell method revealed that the alkA codes for a polypeptide whose molecular weight is about 30,000. When cells harboring the alkA+ plasmids were grown in the presence of low doses of a simple alkylating agent (adapted condition), the activity of 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II was increased. The enzyme activity was copurified with the Mr 30,000 polypeptide. These results indicate that the alkA gene codes for 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II. Taking advantage of overproduction of the alkA protein in adapted cells that harbor multicopy plasmids carrying the alkA+ gene, 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II has been purified to apparent physical homogeneity."

The enzyme cleaves the synthetic substrates Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu-4-nitroanilide, Cbz-Ala-Ala-Leu-4-nitroanilide, and Suc-Phe-Leu-Phe-4-nitroanilide (Cbz and Suc are defined as benzyloxycarbonyl and succinyl, respectively) at the 4-nitroanilide bond and exhibits a slight activity against [3H]methylcasein. Optimum pH for cleavage of the chromogenic substrates is found to be in the range of 8.2 to 8.6. The purified enzyme has an apparent Stokes radius of Rs = 75.2 A as judged by gel chromatography and is composed of subunits. Mercurials were found to be strong inhibitors of the enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1533556186,"Abstract Enkephalinase, a membrane-bound peptidase hydrolyzing the Gly3-Phe4 amide bond of enkephalins, initially characterized in brain, was purified from a rat kidney microsomal fraction. After differential solubilization with Triton X-100, the use of DEAE-Sephadex, concanavalin A, and hydroxylapatite chromatography led to a 2000-fold purification, close to homogeneity. Renal enkephalinase appears to be a glycoprotein Mr = 92,000-95,000 with catalytic properties and sensitivity to chelating agents and inhibitors (Thiorphan, phosphoramidon) very similar to those of the cerebral enzyme. The enzyme co-purified until the final step with renal brush-border neutral proteinase (EC 3.4.24.11) activity assayed with 125I-insulin B chain as substrate and displaying similar sensitivity to inhibitors. The specificity of the purified enkephalinase has been studied using either peptides derived from the enkephalins or model peptides of general formula (Ala)m-Tyr-(Ala)n as substrates. In all cases the bond cleaved was that involving the amino group of an aromatic residue, specificity being also defined by the nature of the neighboring residue on the COOH-terminal side. A free carboxyl in the latter residue was essential in the two series of substrates, indicating that enkephalinase more efficiently functions as a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase than as an endopeptidase."
https://openalex.org/W1578441577,"Abstract Receptor down-regulation is the result of various cellular processes including receptor internalization, new synthesis, and recycling. Monensin, a monocarboxylic acid ionophore, has been used to characterize the role of recycling in the metabolism of insulin receptors on two cultured human cell lines, U-937 and IM-9, which have different rates of internalization. The U-937 monocyte-like cell internalizes insulin receptors readily. Incubation with monensin at low doses (10(-6) to 10(-7) M) for 2 h did not affect subsequent surface insulin binding. However, the drug markedly enhanced insulin-induced down-regulation. Monensin had little effect on ligand internalization in this cell line as demonstrated by quantitative morphometric analysis. The IM-9 lymphocyte, a slow internalizer, was less sensitive to monensin exposure. Prolonged exposure (12 h) to this compound of either cell line resulted in apparent inhibition of insertion into the surface membrane of both newly synthesized and recycled receptors. When solubilization was used to quantitate total cell receptors, there was essentially no difference in intact cell binding (i.e. surface receptors) and total cell binding in IM-9 cells when insulin-induced down regulation alone was compared to insulin and monensin. By contrast for the U-937 cells there was only a small further decrease in binding when monensin was added to insulin in the solubilized cells compared to the marked augmentation of down-regulation when monensin was added to insulin in intact cells. These data demonstrate that cells with a rapid internalization rate have an associated active recycling process. By contrast cells with a slow internalization rate have a similarly slow recycling rate. This is consistent with relatively equal rates of receptor biosynthesis and plasma membrane insertion in both cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1566398478,"To elucidate the role of individual amino acid residues in stabilizing the conformation of a protein, the stabilities of wild-type tryptophan synthase alpha-subunit from Escherichia coli and seven mutant proteins substituted by single amino acid residues at position 49, which is buried in the interior of the protein, were compared. The mutant proteins have Gln, Met, Val, Tyr, Leu, Ser, or Lys in place of Glu in the wild-type protein. The dissociation constant, pK, of the Glu residue at position 49 for the wild-type protein was determined to be 7.5 from a titration curve obtained by comparison of two-dimensional isoelectric focusing electrophoresis of the wild-type and mutant proteins. Our results indicate that 1) the conformational stabilities of the proteins studied increase linearly with hydrophobicity of the substituting residues (except Tyr), with the coefficient of this linear dependence being 2.0, 3.4, or 1.3 at pH 5.5, 7.0, or 9.0, respectively; and 2) Lys or Glu at position 49 serve as a destabilizing factor when ionized."

However, the function of histone acetylation remains unknown. We have approached this question by purifying histone acetyltransferase 15,000-fold from yeast and characterizing it enzymatically. Biochemical properties, including the pH and temperature optima and the Michaelis-Menten constants for both acetyl coenzyme A and histones, are similar to those reported for histone acetyltransferases from higher eukaryotes. Yeast histone acetyltransferase has a native molecular weight of 110,000 as determined by gel filtration and is tightly bound to chromatin. It displays high-substrate specificity for histones. It acetylates all four core histones in the order: H4 greater than H2B greater than H2A. 10-fold higher histone acetyltransferase activity is observed for free histones when compared to yeast polynucleosomes as a substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1548847439,"H1t is a testis-specific H1 variant found in spermatocytes and spermatids of mammals. The complete amino acid sequence has been determined for H1t isolated from boar testes. The protein is composed of 211 amino acids with the composition 3 aspartic acids, 6 asparagines, 13 threonines, 21 serines, 7 glutamic acids, 7 glutamines, 15 prolines, 14 glycines, 37 alanines, 11 valines, 1 methionine, 3 isoleucines, 14 leucines, 1 tyrosine, 1 phenylalanine, 42 lysines, 15 arginines and a calculated molecular weight of 22,059 disregarding the post-translational acetylation of the amino-terminal alanine. The protein shows typical H1 domains with basic amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions separated by a conserved, presumably globular, core sequence. The core region is very homologous to the highly conserved core sequence found in somatic mammalian H1 histones but does differ from this sequence in 15 places. Accordingly, it may be appropriate to consider H1t as new variant category. The carboxyl-terminal half of H1t is distinguished from the standard somatic family by being somewhat shorter and by the presence of 10 arginine residues. In contrast to many H1 proteins, the carboxyl-terminal region of H1t does not show an obvious pattern of peptide repeats."
https://openalex.org/W2121639810,"The effects of insulin, glucagon, pyruvate, and lactate on the rate of sterol synthesis and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase activity were determined in hepatocytes obtained at different times of the day from rats maintained on a controlled lighting and feeding schedule. In hepatocytes from animals killed immediately before the start of the feeding period (D0 hepatocytes), the initially low activity of HMG-CoA reductase increased during incubation while that in hepatocytes prepared 6 h later (D6 hepatocytes) remained constantly high. The rates of sterol synthesis followed similar patterns of change. In both D0 and D6 cells, insulin stimulated HMG-CoA reductase but had little or no effect on the rates of sterol synthesis. In both types of cell preparation glucagon maximally suppressed HMG-CoA reductase activity at a concentration of 10(-7) M, but there was relatively little change in the rates of sterol synthesis. Both pyruvate and lactate mitigated the glucagon-mediated inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. Each of these lipogenic precursors alone suppressed the rate of sterol synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. These changes were more apparent in the simultaneous presence of insulin and were greater in the D0 compared to the D6 hepatocytes. In the presence of lactate or pyruvate, the activity of HMG-CoA reductase was elevated, and the increase was greater when insulin was simultaneously present. In general, changes in the rate of fatty acid synthesis were positively correlated with changes in the activity of HMG-CoA reductase. These observations suggest that the latter changes are required to compensate for variations in the availability of simple precursors for sterol synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1526360847,"A limited reduction of the disulfide bonds of bovine enterokinase (enteropeptidase, EC 3.4.21.9) was accomplished with 50 mM dithioerythritol, at pH 9.0, and at 4 degrees C. The conditions separated the heavy and light subunits quantitatively with improved reliability when compared to the conditions used previously (Savithri, H. S., and Light, A. (1980) Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun, 94, 360-365). Pancreatic trypsin inhibitor was added to the reaction to ensure that the yield of the heavy subunit was equal to that of the catalytic subunit (light subunit). Otherwise the heavy subunit was subject to extensive degradation. The subunits were alkylated with iodoacetate and then resolved on Sephadex G-150. Amino acid analyses and the incorporation of [14C]carboxymethyl groups showed that 3.1 carboxymethylcysteine residues were in the catalytic subunit and 8.9 in the heavy subunit. The catalytic subunit had normal catalytic activity toward N-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester, enhanced activity toward N-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester and N-tosyl-L-lysine methyl ester, and lower activity toward N-benzoyl-DL-arginine p-nitroanilide. The catalytic subunit retained the restricted specificity of intact enterokinase, but the rate of activation of trypsinogen was much slower. It is likely that the limited reduction of the disulfide bonds of the catalytic subunit altered the interaction of protein substrates with the specificity site."
https://openalex.org/W1524623067,"A convenient and efficient procedure for the purification of cytidine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.5) from Escherichia coli is reported. The key step involves adsorption of the enzyme from a crude ammonium sulfate fraction onto a cytidine-containing affinity resin, followed by elution with 0.5 M borate buffer. Subsequent chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose results in an overall 1690-fold purification, yielding enzyme with a specific activity of 118 units/mg. Cytidine deaminase has an apparent molecular weight of 54,000 as determined by gel filtration, whereas sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows a band at molecular weight 35,000. Cytidine deaminase is inhibited by 5-(chloromercuri)cytidine with kinetic behavior typical of active-site-directed inactivation, with KD = 0.09 mM and kinact = 1.25 min-1. The enzyme is protected against inactivation in the presence of substrate, and the inhibition is reversed with high concentrations of mercaptoethanol. This suggests that inactivation is the result of a mercaptide formation between the mercury and an active-site thiol."

Compound 1 was designed as a transition-state analog, and is a potent, slow-binding inhibitor of cytidine deaminase (Ashley, G. W., and Bartlett, P. A. (1982) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 108, 1467-1474). We present evidence that the binding of 1 is reversible, with no covalent linkage between the enzyme and 1. At pH 6, the rate of recovery of enzyme activity from dissociation of the E X I complex is strongly dependent on the concentration of E X I, indicating that the inhibitor dissociates reversibly. UV difference spectroscopy reveals that the chromophore of 1 is unaltered on binding to the enzyme, thus eliminating the possibility of reversible, covalent modification of the enzyme. For the binding of the active beta-anomers of 1 to cytidine deaminase, the following kinetic parameters were determined at pH 6: kon = 8300 M-1 S-1, koff = 7.8 X 10(-6) S-1, Ki = 0.9 nM. We were also able to observe and characterize time-dependent inhibition of E. coli cytidine deaminase by tetrahydrouridine, 3. This interaction involves involves initial formation of a loose complex (KD = 1.2 microM), followed by isomerization in a slow step to give a more tightly bound complex (Ki = 0.24 microM) with forward and reverse rate constants kf = 3.81 min-1 and kr = 0.95 min-1, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1597119329,"The sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (glycerol-P) acyltransferase of Escherichia coli cytoplasmic membrane was purified in Triton X-100 (Green, P. R., Merrill, A. H., Jr., and Bell, R. M. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11151-11159) and incorporated into mixed micelles containing Triton X-100, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, and beta-octyl glucoside. Enzyme activity was quantitatively reconstituted from the mixed micelle into single-walled phospholipid vesicles by chromatography over Sephadex G-50. Activity coeluted with vesicles of 90-nm average diameter on columns of Sepharose CL-4B and Sephacryl S-1000. These vesicles contained less than 2 Triton X-100 and 5 beta-octyl glucoside molecules/100 phospholipid molecules. Calculations suggested that up to eight 91,260-dalton glycerol-P acyltransferase polypeptides were incorporated per 90-nm vesicle. The pH dependence and apparent Km values for glycerol-P and palmitoyl-CoA of the glycerol-P acyltransferase reconstituted into vesicles were similar to those observed upon reconstitution by mixing of the enzyme in Triton X-100 with a 20-fold molar excess of sonicated phosphatidylethanolamine:phosphatidylglycerol:cardiolipin, 6:1:1. The integrity of vesicles containing glycerol-P acyltransferase was established by trapping 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Chymotrypsin inactivated greater than 95% of the glycerol-P acyltransferase in intact vesicles and cleaved the 91,260-dalton polypeptide into several vesicle-bound and several released peptides, indicating that critical domains of the enzyme are accessible in intact vesicles. Trinitrobenzene sulfonate and 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic acid stilbene caused greater than 90% loss of glycerol-P acyltransferase in vesicles. Disruption of vesicles with Triton X-100 did not reveal significant latent activity. These data strongly suggest that the glycerol-P acyltransferase was reconstituted asymmetrically into the vesicles with its active site facing outward."
https://openalex.org/W1557596339,"Abstract GTP:mRNA guanylyltransferase, an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of the GMP moiety from GTP to the 5' end of the RNA to form a cap structure (G(5')pppN-), has been purified to an apparent homogeneity from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The mRNA 5'-triphosphatase activity hydrolyzing the gamma-phosphoryl group from pppN-RNA was co-purified with mRNA guanylyltransferase activity through column chromatographies on CM-Sephadex and poly(U)-Sepharose, and centrifugation through glycerol gradients, suggesting that these two activities are physically associated. An 820,w value of 7.3, and Mr = 140,000 were estimated from the sedimentation behavior in glycerol gradients. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, two major polypeptides, Mr = 45,000 (alpha) and 39,000 (beta), were detected with the purified enzyme preparation. Their molar ratios were close to unity when estimated by the relative density of silver staining. These results suggest that the yeast mRNA-capping enzyme is an oligomeric protein which may consist of two alpha and two beta chains (alpha 2 beta 2)."
https://openalex.org/W1496807944,"Absorption, CD, and magnetic circular dichroism spectra are reported for the alpha fragment of rat liver Cd,Zn-metallothionein (MT) 2. The CD and magnetic circular dichroism spectra of the Cd4 cluster unit are particularly well-resolved and are remarkably similar to data of the complete Cd,Zn-MT. It is suggested that the high signal intensity in the 225 nm CD band may be attributed to an interaction between a terminal amino acid residue and the Cd4 cluster. Titration experiments with CdCl2 and [Cu(CH3CN)4]+ show that while no additional Cd2+ can be bound in the presence of excess Cd2+, Cu+ does replace the bound Cd2+ in a complex reaction to form at least two species. One of these species requires the presence of both Cu+ and Cd2+, with a stoichiometry of Cu 3.0, Cd 2.5. Further, Cu+ displaces all the remaining Cd2+, and the spectra recorded now closely resemble Cu-MT formed by titration of Cd,Zn-MT with greater than 8 mol eq of Cu+."

In cells carrying plasmids with a functional copy of metJ, the methionine regulon appears to be repressed even under conditions of methionine limitation. Maxicell labeling experiments show that the plasmids code for a small peptide (12 kilodaltons) only when they carry a functional copy of metJ. The lesions in five independently isolated metJ mutants are located in, or slightly upstream from, a coding sequence proposed to be metJ by Saint-Girons, I., Duchange, N., Cohen, G. N., and Zakin, M.

https://openalex.org/W1512342812,"After infection of Escherichia coli with bacteriophage T4, the host RNA polymerase acquires several small phage-induced polypeptides (Stevens, A. (1974) Biochemistry 13, 493-503) and its alpha subunits get ADP-ribosylated by a virus-specific enzyme (Zillig, W., Mailhammer, R., Skorko, R., and Rohrer, H. (1977) Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 12, 263-271). The modified polymerase displays changed enzymatic properties including sensitivity to increased salt concentration and a higher transition temperature of open promoter complex formation (promoter melting temperature). In order to assess the role of individual modifications in the changed enzyme properties, we isolated RNA polymerase from cells infected with T4 mutant defective in the ADP-ribosylating enzyme. We also purified one of the associated polypeptides, the 15,000-dalton protein which is invariably present in stoichiometric amounts in different RNA polymerase preparations. In an in vitro transcription system using T4 DNA as template, we demonstrate that the 15-kDa protein is the cause of the elevated promoter melting temperature and can induce this property when added to host RNA polymerase. We also show that the increased salt sensitivity of T4-modified polymerase is primarily the result of ADP-ribosylation of its alpha subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1564624048,"Postpolysomal extracts from wild-type (wt A364A) and temperature-sensitive (ts 7'-14) yeast cells were preincubated for short periods of time at the nonpermissive temperature (37-41 degrees C) prior to incubations for protein synthesis at 20 degrees C. Whereas wt A364A extracts were relatively unaffected by preincubation at the elevated temperature, mutant extracts lost their ability to translate exogenous natural mRNA and poly(U). Phe-tRNA synthetase and ribosomes from ts 7'-14 cells were not inactivated by preincubation at 37-41 degrees C, but a cytosolic component required for chain elongation, as measured by poly(U) translation, was extensively inactivated. The three elongation factors (EF-1, EF-2, and EF-3) required for chain elongation in yeast were resolved chromatographically. Only one factor, EF-3, was able to restore the poly(U)-translational activity of mutant extracts inactivated at the elevated temperature. Heat-inactivated yeast cytosols, which did not support protein synthesis with yeast ribosomes, were perfectly able to translate poly(U) with rat liver ribosomes, which require only EF-1 and EF-2. These and other experiments indicated that the genetically altered component in 7'-14 mutant cells is EF-3."
https://openalex.org/W1524053457,"The interaction of elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and elongation factor Ts (EF-Ts) from Escherichia coli has been investigated by kinetic methods. It was found that EF-Ts purified on an EF-Tu affinity column contained a transphosphorylase activity which could transfer the gamma-phosphate of GTP to [3H]GDP. However, this activity showed different sensitivities to heat and N-ethylmaleimide compared to the EF-Ts activity. Using the chromophoric GDP analogue, 2-amino-6-mercaptopurine riboside 5'-diphosphate (thioGDP), spectrophotometric titrations and stopped-flow experiments enabled the interaction of EF-Tu X thioGDP with EF-Ts and of EF-Tu X EF-Ts with thioGDP to be investigated. The results were analyzed according to the scheme of Chau et al. (Chau, V., Romero, G., and Biltonen, R.L. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 5591-5596). (Formula: see text) Values for the rate constants obtained were k1 greater than or equal to 2 X 10(8) M-1 s-1, k-1 greater than or equal to 2600 s-1, k2 = 500 s-1, and k-2 = 4 X 10(5) M-1 s-1. The most notable feature of these results is that EF-Ts binds to EF-Tu X thioGDP at a rate approaching that expected for a diffusion-controlled reaction whereas thioGDP binds to EF-Tu X EF-Ts several orders of magnitude more slowly than this. The relevance of these results to the interactions involving GDP is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1678933099,"D-Glucose and D-galactose influx and efflux rates in human erythrocytes were studied using infinite-cis and zero-trans assay methods. It was found that insulin decreased the infinite-cis Km for both D-glucose and D-galactose influx by 44 and 56%, respectively, while the Vmax was unchanged. The Km for D-glucose efflux in the presence of insulin decreased by 47% when compared to controls, and the change in Vmax was statistically insignificant. If insulin receptors were first down regulated, and then influx and efflux assays were performed, decreases in the infinite-cis and zero-trans Km values were also observed in the absence of exogenous insulin. These affinity changes were not due to persistent surface insulin receptor occupation by the insulin which was used to induce down-regulation. These affinity changes were comparable to those observed in non-down-regulated cells in the presence of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1513408858,"Incubation of primary cultures of rat hepatocytes with tunicamycin (1 microgram/ml) for 16 h inhibits de novo glycosylation by more than 90%, yet 50% of initial 125I-insulin binding is still present. The remaining insulin-binding activity is to glycosylated receptors, since they are adsorbed and specifically desorbed from wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose. Furthermore, there is no difference in the molecular weight size of the alpha-subunit of the insulin receptors either in normal or tunicamycin-treated hepatocytes as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 125I-insulin receptor cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate. This gives us an opportunity to study the function of these glycosylated insulin receptors in cells where de novo glycosylation is inhibited. Inhibition of de novo glycosylation decreases receptor-mediated 125I-insulin internalization and degradation. The tunicamycin-treated cells are totally resistant to insulin with regard to [14C]aminoisobutyric acid uptake. In contrast, there is normal stimulation of [14C] acetate and [14C]glucose incorporation into lipids and glycogen by a maximal concentration of insulin. The interpretation of these data is, however, complicated by the fact that tunicamycin markedly inhibits basal lipid synthesis without altering basal glycogen synthesis or [14C]aminoisobutyric uptake. These results demonstrate the heterogeneity of the postinsulin binding system in the liver. Besides glycosylation of the insulin receptor, which is needed for insulin binding, other cellular glycoproteins are important for insulin processing as well as mediation of some, but not all, of the biological actions of insulin. The nature of these liver glycoproteins and their relationship to the insulin receptor have not yet been defined."
https://openalex.org/W1924905712,"Hybrids were constructed of the genes for two homologous enzymes, 6-aminohexanoic acid-oligomer hydrolase (EII, one of the nylon oligomer degradation enzymes), and its probable evolutionary antecedent (EII'). The structural genes of EII (nylB) and EII' (nylB') have 88% similarity in their nucleotide sequences, an open frame encoding a peptide of 392 amino acids, conserved restriction sites, and in vitro recombination between these genes at the corresponding restriction sites generated genes directing various hybrid enzymes. In a comparison of the EII, EII', and the hybrid enzymes, we concluded that one or more of the four amino acid alterations that occurred in the intramolecular region (between amino acids 162-257) of EII' is essential to the adaptation of the enzyme to nylon oligomer degradation, and that its effect is enhanced 20-fold by one or more further alterations in the 258-380 region. Our results also suggest that this technique is useful for improving enzyme characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W1491808891,"We have previously reported that the precursor of rat liver mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, synthesized in vitro, is about 1,500 to 2,000 Mr larger than the mature enzyme and can be processed to the mature size by isolated mitochondria from Chinese hamster ovary cells (Chien, S.-M. and Freeman, K. B. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3337-3342). Furthermore, binding, but not processing, was observed in the presence of an uncoupler. Binding was insensitive to temperature and was completed within 2.5 min at 0 degrees C. The role of binding in the overall process of import of the precursor is now further characterized. The precursor form, bound either in the presence of an uncoupler or at 0 degrees C, was sensitive to trypsin suggesting that binding occurs on the mitochondrial outer membrane. Saturation of binding was observed with a limited amount of mitochondria and an excess of in vitro translated rat liver proteins indicating that there is a finite number of binding sites. Furthermore, when the precursor was prebound to mitochondria at 0 degrees C for 5 min, the precursor was processed to the mature size and the rate of processing was independent of the volume of reaction mixture. In contrast, the rate of processing of unbound precursor was dependent on reaction volume. These results strongly suggest that binding of the precursor of malate dehydrogenase to the mitochondrial outer membrane is an intermediate step in its import."
https://openalex.org/W2000670545,"A protein (27,000 molecular weight) was previously found in rat Leydig cells after treatment with estradiol (E2) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in vitro. The effect of hCG occurred through increased E2 production. This hormone-regulated rat testicular protein was compared to an estrogen-regulated protein of similar physical characteristics isolated from a human mammary cancer cell line (MCF-7) and present in normal human estrogen target organs. The Leydig cells from rat and human tissue showed specific immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase staining in the cytoplasm upon incubation with a monoclonal antibody (C11) to the estrogen-regulated protein from MCF-7 cells. Leydig cells after exposure to E2 or hCG showed the highest fluorescence intensity; this intensity was reduced by treatment with Tamoxifen. No reaction was associated with other testicular cells. The estrogen-regulated protein from human cell lines is therefore immunologically similar to that from the rat Leydig cell. The monoclonal antibody should be useful for further characterization of the Leydig cell protein."
https://openalex.org/W1520988838,"The catalytic subunit of aspartate transcarbamoylase from Escherichia coli reacts readily with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonate, resulting in the loss of enzymatic activity. Substrates and substrate analogs protect the enzyme in a competitive manner, indicating that the loss of activity is due to modification of active-site residues. This conclusion was confirmed by fractionating tryptic digests of the modified protein followed by the identification of active-site lysines 83 and 84 as the modified residues. When three trinitrophenyl groups are incorporated per catalytic trimer, 70% of the activity is lost. The modified protein retains the sedimentation velocity and electrophoretic properties of the native catalytic subunit and can associate with regulatory subunit to form a holoenzyme-like molecule. The trinitrophenylated catalytic trimers have two strong absorption bands at 345 and 420 nm which serve as sensitive spectral probes in difference-spectroscopy experiments. Results from such experiments show that 1) the modified trimeric enzyme binds active-site ligands; 2) dissociation of the trimer into compact, highly structured monomers gives a spectral response distinguishable from that observed when the chains are completely unfolded; and 3) even though dissociation of the trimers to folded monomers causes the complete loss of enzyme activity, the resulting monomers still retain the ability to bind the bisubstrate analog N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate. These results indicate that the active site must be at least partially formed in the absence of any quaternary structure."
https://openalex.org/W1547988900,"A family of guanosine 3',5'-phosphorylated nucleotides have been postulated to have pleiotypic regulatory properties in prokaryotes during the stringent response. To study proteins which may interact with nucleotides of this homologous series, a photoactive analog of guanosine 3',5'-diphosphate has been synthesized. The analog, 8-azidoguanosine 3'-phosphate 5'-[5'-32P]phosphate, proved to be an effective photoaffinity probe for two nucleotide-binding proteins of Escherichia coli sonicates. It predominately photolabels two proteins with approximate molecular weights of 86,000 and 65,000 (p86 and p65, respectively). The Kd for p65 was approximately 10 microM; that for p86 was not determined. The nucleotide-binding sites were characterized by photolabeling in the presence of various nucleotides. The nucleotides guanosine 3',5'-dipyrophosphate, guanosine 3'-monophosphate 5'-diphosphate, and GTP were most effective at decreasing photoincorporation into p86; guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-monophosphate was least effective, with guanosine 3',5'-diphosphate and GMP having an intermediate effect. ATP increased photolabeling of p86. However, ATP was one of the best of the nucleotides studied at decreasing photolabeling of p65, although guanosine 3'-monophosphate 5'-diphosphate, guanosine 3',5'-diphosphate, and GMP appeared only slightly less effective. The relative lack of effectiveness of guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-monophosphate inhibiting photolabeling of either protein supports observations that this nucleotide does not have a regulatory role in E. coli. The results presented indicate that the 8-azidoguanosine analogs of this homologous series will prove to be effective probes for studying the protein-nucleotide interactions involved in the stringent response."
