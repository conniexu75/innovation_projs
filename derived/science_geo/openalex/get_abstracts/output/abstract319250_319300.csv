These compounds, unlike anisylacetone, heretofore the best lure, attract even newly emerged flies. The most potent analog is 4-(p-acetoxyphenyl)-2-butanone (II), which also strongly attracts Dacus ochrosiae males."

https://openalex.org/W2084338718,"The far-northern climate has warmed 2 degrees Celsium since the 1880s, much more than the rest of the world. A warmer climate might be expected to speed tree growth and drive the northern edge of the forest farther into the Arctic. However a 4 year study of growth rings in trees growing near the timberline in northern and central Alaska indicated differently. Two researchers, Jacoby and D`Arrigo of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, report that as the high latitudes warmed over the past 100 years, tree growth accelerated at first, but recently the growth rate has flattened while the climate continues to warm. This article discusses how the research was done and the possible implications and explanations, including the possibility that warmer temperatures may encourage outbreaks of insect pests."

https://openalex.org/W2092473998,Abstract Serious losses have occurred each year during June and early July from chickens having eaten the rose chafers (Macrodactylus subspinosus). These losses have often been ascribed to various causes but close observations have shown that the chickens are very fond of eating the in sects and post mortem examinations have revealed the presence of many undigested rose chafers in their crops. The crops are usually so full as to give the impression that death had been due to a “crop-bound” condition of the chickens. Some have also supposed that these deaths were due to a mechanical injury of the crop by the spines on the legs of the insects having punctured the lining of this part of the digestive system while others have accounted for the death of these chickens by the rose chafers having bitten the crops. A number of cases some of which resulted in the loss of …
