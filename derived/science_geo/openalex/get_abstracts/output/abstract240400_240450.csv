The FoxO subfamily of forkhead transcription factors has been shown to mediate some of the effects of Sirtuins. Here we have shown that Sirtuin activation or hydrogen peroxide treatment overrides the phosphorylation-dependent nuclear exclusion of FoxO1 caused by growth factors and causes nuclear translocation of FoxO1 in hepatocytes. Kinetic measurements of nuclear fluorescence recovery after photobleaching show that FoxO1 is readily diffusible within the nucleus under normal conditions but becomes restricted within a nuclear subdomain following treatment with the prototypical Sirtuin agonist resveratrol or oxidative stress. Expression of FoxO1 target genes is accordingly increased, leading to activation of gluconeogenesis and increased glucose release from hepatocytes. Selective modulation of the FoxO/Sirtuin interaction represents a promising therapeutic modality for metabolic disorders.

Selective modulation of the FoxO/Sirtuin interaction represents a promising therapeutic modality for metabolic disorders. The long-standing observation that caloric restriction is associated with longevity has led to a widely held theory that metabolism and life span share common cellular pathways (1Wood J.G. Rogina B.

Genetic epistasis in Caenorhabditis elegans and metabolic studies in mice indicate that FoxO genes regulate cell differentiation, transformation, and metabolism (6Accili D. Arden K.C.

In C. elegans, mutations of the FoxO ortholog Daf16 rescue the dauer state caused by mutations of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor receptor ortholog Daf2 (7Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S.

Moreover, extra copies of the gene encoding the NAD-dependent deacetylase Silent Information Regulator (Sir) 2.1 prolong life span in a Daf16-dependent fashion (9Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Nature. 2001; 410: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar), suggesting that FoxO activity is regulated via deacetylation. These twin observations provide the underpinning for investigations of the role of FoxO proteins in mammalian metabolism and life span. FoxO activity is subject to complex regulation by growth factors and cellular stress. The former inhibit FoxO via serine-threonine phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion (10Kops G.J. Burgering B.M. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The latter causes FoxO acetylation, thus promoting the interaction between FoxO and Sirt1, the mammalian ortholog of Sir2.1 (4van der Horst A. Tertoolen L.G. de Vries-Smits L.M. Frye R.A. Medema R.H.

However, the effect of Sirt1-dependent deacetylation on FoxO function remains somewhat controversial, with most (4van der Horst A. Tertoolen L.G. de Vries-Smits L.M. Frye R.A. Medema R.H.

In this study, we sought to uncover the mechanism by which stress-induced deacetylation affects FoxO activity. To this end, we studied FoxO translocation using live cell imaging, coupled to measurements of protein kinetics with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) 1The abbreviations used are: FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; FLIP, fluorescence loss in photobleaching; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NAM, nicotinamide; HDAC, histone deacetylase; TsA, trichostatin A. 1The abbreviations used are: FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; FLIP, fluorescence loss in photobleaching; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NAM, nicotinamide; HDAC, histone deacetylase; TsA, trichostatin A. and fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) experiments (13Lippincott-Schwartz J. Altan-Bonnet N. Patterson G.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; : S7-S14PubMed Google Scholar). We also measured expression of FoxO1 target genes and glucose production in hepatocyte cultures. Our findings are consistent with a model in which deacetylation promotes FoxO nuclear retention and increases FoxO-dependent glucose production, thus providing evidence for a mechanism to regulate FoxO activity via subnuclear targeting. DNA Constructs and Cell Transfection—We cloned a mouse FoxO1 cDNA into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech Laboratories) to generate FoxO1-GFP. We used FuGENE 6 (2.5 μg/ml DNA) (Roche Applied Science) to obtain transiently transfected cells expressing FoxO1-GFP. We have described the adenoviral vector expressing HA-tagged wild type FoxO1 in previous publications (14Nakae J. Kitamura T. Silver D.L. Accili D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). We transduced cells with adenoviral vectors 24 h before the experiment. Cell Culture—We cultured Sv40 hepatocytes or H4IIE rat hepatoma cells in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 4% fetal calf serum, 1% Pen-Strep, and 200 nm dexamethasone at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. We lysed cells in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Na deoxycholate, 5 mm Na orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm nicotinamide, and 2 μm trichostatin A (TsA). Immunoprecipitation was carried out using anti-HA (12CA5; Roche Applied Science) and anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies (A-11120; Molecular Probes). We processed a 50-μg aliquot of immunoprecipitated proteins for electrophoresis and Western blotting using antisera against FoxO1 (H-128; Santa Cruz), Sirt1 (Upstate Biotechnology), phospho-Ser253 FoxO1, Akt, phospho-Ser473-Akt, or acetyl lysine (Cell Signaling). We employed the following concentrations of reagents: H2O2 0.5 mm, insulin 100 nm, resveratrol 10 μm, nicotinamide 10 mm, and Trichostatin A 2 μm. All were from Sigma. We used Leptomycin B (LC Laboratories) at 20 nm. We cultured HEK 293 cells in minimal essential medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 1% Pen-Strep and transduced them with an adenoviral vector containing HA-tagged wild type FoxO1 24 h before the experiment (14Nakae J. Kitamura T. Silver D.L. Accili D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Image Acquisition and Analysis—We plated and observed cells in LabTek chambers (Nalgene). We captured confocal microscope images on a LSM 510 META microscope (Zeiss) using 488 nm laser excitation for GFP and 568 for rhodamine. Images were captured with a ×63 1.2 water objective and an open pinhole to collect fluorescence from the entire depth of the cell. We analyzed images with the Image J software (NIH). We measured fluorescence separately within the nucleus and the cytoplasm. To calculate relative nuclear fluorescence, we divided nuclear fluorescence by the total amount of cellular fluorescence. Time lapse sequences of images of FoxO1-GFP nuclear translocation were captured with a ×63 1.2 water objective at 10-s intervals (15Lippincott-Schwartz J. Patterson G.H. Science. 2003; 300: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). All quantitative values represent averages from at least 20 cells from five independent experiments. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—We prepared cells for immunofluorescence microscopy by transfecting FoxO1-GFP by FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and staining for Sirt1 in LabTek chambered slides (Nalgene). We fixed cells in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, washed using PBS, and treated them with 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.1, for 10 min. Thereafter, we permeabilized cell membranes with PBS and 0.2% Triton X-100, washed in PBS, and incubated in blocking buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 10 min. Subsequently, we incubated cells with Sirt1 antiserum (Cell Signaling) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, washed in PBS, and incubated with a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were mounted using Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech). FRAP Analysis—We plated, transfected, and observed cells in LabTek II chambers (Nalgene). We performed selective photobleaching of the nucleus on a LSM 510 META microscope (Zeiss) using 488 nm laser excitation for GFP and a ×63 1.2 water objective. We photobleached a defined region (outlined in the figures) at full laser power (100% power for 15 s). Thereafter, we monitored fluorescence recovery by scanning the whole cell at low laser power (4% power every 7.5 s). We observed no photobleaching during recovery. For FLIP experiments, we repeatedly imaged and bleached cells at 20-s intervals. Bleaching and imaging settings were identical to the ones used in FRAP. We generated FRAP recovery curves from background-subtracted images. We determined the total cell fluorescence for each image using Image J software (NIH) and compared the percentage of nuclear fluorescence to the initial value to account for the amount lost during the bleach pulse (15Lippincott-Schwartz J. Patterson G.H. Science. 2003; 300: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). All quantitative values represent averages from at least 10 cells from five independent experiments. Gene Expression Studies—We isolated RNA using RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen), followed by DNase (Qiagen) digestion to remove contaminating DNA. We carried out first strand synthesis with the Superscript system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We carried out real-time quantitative PCR using a DNA Engine Opticon 2 System instrument (MJ Research) and DyNAmo SYBR Green quantitative PCR kit (Finnzymes). Reactions were carried out in triplicate, using β-actin or Hprt to normalize mRNA content (16Kitamura T. Nakae J. Kitamura Y. Kido Y. Biggs III, W.H. Wright C.V. White M.F. Arden K.C. Accili D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Primer sequences are available upon request. We employed standard PCR conditions. Measurement of Glucose Release from H4IIE Hepatoma Cells—To measure glucose production, we removed the growth medium, washed cells with PBS three times, and incubated with glucose- and serum-free α-minimal essential medium for 1 h. We then washed with PBS and incubated cells in glucose- and serum-free α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 200 nm dexamethasone, 20 μm forskolin, 2 mm glutamine, 16 mm lactate, and 4 mm pyruvate (Sigma) (17Rother K.I.

We measured glucose concentration in triplicate using the Amplex red glucose assay (Invitrogen). Results are the mean of two independent experiments performed in triplicate. Hydrogen Peroxide Treatment Affects FoxO Shuttling—We first determined the cellular distribution of FoxO1 using a FoxO1-GFP fusion protein in hepatocytes. FoxO1-GFP localized primarily to the cytoplasm (70% cytoplasmic and 30% nuclear) in the presence of serum, whereas in the absence of serum the cellular distribution is reversed (70% nuclear and 30% cytoplasmic) (Fig. 1, A and B). These data show that the GFP tag does not affect FoxO distribution. Treatment of cells with H2O2 to cause oxidative stress caused up to 70% of FoxO1-GFP to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, regardless of the presence of serum (Fig. 1, A and B). Time course analysis indicated that FoxO1-GFP began to localize to the nucleus after ∼45 min in H2O2-treated cells and achieved steady-state levels (nuclear percentage levels above 70%) at 120 min, with a t½ = 80 min (Fig. 1C). We obtained identical results in Cos7 cells (Fig. 1D). The changes in FoxO1 distribution could not be accounted for by perturbations to the fluorophor, as the localization of GFP expressed in the same cells was unaffected by oxidative stress (Fig. 1E). The delayed nuclear translocation of FoxO1-GFP during peroxide treatment may be caused by a transient increase in Akt activity (data not shown). This may account for the apparent discrepancy between reports of FoxO phosphorylation (18Nemoto S. Finkel T. Science. 2002; 295: 2450-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) and nuclear translocation (5Brunet A. Sweeney L.B. Sturgill J.F. Chua K.F. Greer P.L. Lin Y. Tran H. Ross S.E. Mostoslavsky R. Cohen H.Y. Hu L.S. Cheng H.L. Jedrychowski M.P. Gygi S.P. Sinclair D.A. Alt F.W. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2004; 303: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar) in response to H2O2. To further clarify this point, we measured whether insulin treatment could override the effect of H2O2. Addition of insulin promoted FoxO1-GFP localization to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, A and B) with a rapid time course (t½ = 13 min, data not shown) but was unable to do so in the presence of H2O2 (Fig. 1, A and B). Consistent with these results, we observed that insulin-induced FoxO phosphorylation was abolished in H2O2-treated cells (Fig. 1F). FoxO Acetylation and Nuclear Shuttling—To determine the mechanism by which FoxO1 translocates to the nucleus during oxidative stress, we tested the effect of agents that affect FoxO1 acetylation. The small molecule activator of NAD-dependent deacetylases (Sirtuins) (19Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar), resveratrol (20Howitz K.T. Bitterman K.J. Cohen H.Y. Lamming D.W. Lavu S. Wood J.G. Zipkin R.E. Chung P. Kisielewski A. Zhang L.L. Scherer B. Sinclair D.A. Nature. 2003; 425: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (3088) Google Scholar), caused FoxO1-GFP translocation to the nucleus (Fig. 2, A and B) with a t½ = 15 min (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction of FoxO1 with Sirt1 contributes to its nuclear distribution. Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that Sirt1 could be detected in FoxO1 immunopellets following H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2C, middle lane). Conversely, treatment with the Sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM) and the class I/II histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor TsA prevented Sirt1 binding to FoxO1 (Fig. 2C, right lane). Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies showed that FoxO1-GFP colocalized with Sirt1 in the nucleus during H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2D). Combined treatment with resveratrol and H2O2 also caused nuclear translocation (Fig. 2, A and B). To determine whether the effect of oxidative stress on FoxO1 is mediated solely through Sirtuins or also through class I/II HDACs, we compared the effects of NAM and TsA on FoxO1-GFP translocation. Treatment with either TsA or NAM failed to affect FoxO1-GFP localization. TsA had no effect on H2O2-dependent nuclear accumulation of FoxO1, whereas NAM completely reversed the effect of H2O2 (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, prior NAM treatment prevented FoxO1-GFP nuclear translocation in response to H2O2 (data not shown). Moreover, NAM was able to prevent resveratrol-induced nuclear localization of FoxO1-GFP, whereas TsA treatment did not affect the response to resveratrol (Fig. 2, A and B). As Sirtuins have been shown to deacetylate FoxO (4van der Horst A. Tertoolen L.G. de Vries-Smits L.M. Frye R.A. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 2004; 116: 551-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar), we sought to determine the acetylation status of FoxO1 under different conditions. Treatment with NAM alone for 2 h increased FoxO1 acetylation, whereas incubation with insulin, H2O2, or resveratrol had no effect (Fig. 2E). Unlike previous data showing promiscuous FoxO deacetylation by Sirtuins and HDACs (4van der Horst A. Tertoolen L.G. de Vries-Smits L.M. Frye R.A. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 2004; 116: 551-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar), these findings are consistent with the possibility that Sirtuins are the specific FoxO deacetylases in hepatocytes. Sirtuin-mediated Deacetylation Perturbs FoxO1 Nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling—We measured the shuttling properties of FoxO1 using FRAP. In these experiments, an area of the cell is photobleached with a high intensity laser pulse and the movement of unbleached molecules from neighboring areas into the bleached area is recorded by time lapse microscopy (13Lippincott-Schwartz J. Altan-Bonnet N. Patterson G.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; : S7-S14PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence recovery depends on the amount of time required for total cell fluorescence to achieve steady-state distribution between different cellular compartments following the photobleach. We selectively photobleached the nuclear FoxO1-GFP pool and monitored the recovery from the cytoplasmic pool. In the presence of serum, nuclear FoxO1-GFP fluorescence recovered its prebleaching levels within 200 s (Fig. 3, A and B, squares). Importantly, after selective bleaching of the nuclear pool, cytoplasmic FoxO1-GFP fluorescence decreased as nuclear fluorescence increased. We then performed FRAP experiments in serum-deprived cells. Within 350 s of selectively photobleaching the nuclear FoxO1-GFP pool, the nucleus completely recovered the prebleaching fluorescence levels (Fig. 3, A and B, triangles), whereas the cytoplasmic pool of FoxO1-GFP fluorescence decreased. These data show that FoxO1-GFP is mobile between the two compartments and shuttles constitutively between the nucleus and the cytoplasm independently of serum. The main difference between the two conditions is that the rate of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is slower in serum-deprived cells (t½ = 350 versus 200 s), probably reflecting reduced phosphorylation-dependent nuclear export. Next, we measured the mobility of FoxO1-GFP in resveratrol-treated cells. In the presence of resveratrol, the nucleus regained only 40% of total cellular FoxO1-GFP fluorescence observed prior to photobleaching (Fig. 3, A and B, diamonds), whereas 60% of FoxO1-GFP was found in the nucleus. Similarly, FRAP experiments in H2O2-treated cells indicated that the nucleus regained only 35% of total prebleaching fluorescence after 350 s (Fig. 3, A and B, circles). Although this 35% continued to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, 65% of FoxO1-GFP appeared to be sequestered in the nucleus. The decrease in the mobile fraction of FoxO1-GFP in resveratrol- and H2O2-treated cells suggests that FoxO1-GFP is actively retained within the nucleus. Because NAM prevented nuclear accumulation of FoxO1-GFP in H2O2-treated cells, we tested whether it could restore FoxO1 shuttling in the presence of H2O2 or resveratrol. FRAP analysis of cells treated with H2O2 or resveratrol showed that NAM, but not TsA (Fig. 4A), was able to restore nuclear fluorescence to prebleaching levels. This indicated that FoxO1-GFP is mobile between the nucleus and cytoplasm when Sirtuins, but not when class I/II HDACs, are inhibited. As a control to rule out interference from the fluorophor during oxidative stress on FoxO1-GFP kinetics, we performed FRAP experiments in cells transfected with GFP and treated with H2O2. Within 80 s of selectively photobleaching the nuclear pool of GFP, the nucleus recovered the prebleaching fluorescence levels (data not shown). These data indicate that GFP is freely mobile between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and that H2O2 does not obstruct GFP kinetics. Measurements of FoxO Kinetics using FLIP—Because only a small percentage of FoxO1-GFP fluorescence could be detected in the nucleus after FRAP experiments in H2O2- and resveratrol-treated cells, we conducted FLIP experiments (13Lippincott-Schwartz J. Altan-Bonnet N. Patterson G.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; : S7-S14PubMed Google Scholar) to test whether FoxO1-GFP is bound to the nuclear compartment. By repeatedly photobleaching fluorescence in a selected area of the cell and monitoring the fluorescence in the non-photobleached regions, the mobility of a fluorescently tagged protein can be readily observed and the continuity of cellular environments determined (21Patterson G.H. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Science. 2002; 297: 1873-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). The rate of fluorescence loss is dependent on the mobility of the protein. As such, proteins that do not move between compartments show no loss (13Lippincott-Schwartz J. Altan-Bonnet N. Patterson G.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; : S7-S14PubMed Google Scholar). We repeatedly photobleached a portion of the cytoplasm in H2O2-treated cells and captured images between pulses. After 500 s, all cytoplasmic FoxO1-GFP fluorescence was lost (Fig. 4B). The repeated bleach pulses did not affect the majority of nuclear FoxO1-GFP fluorescence, suggesting that a large percentage of FoxO1-GFP is bound to the nuclear compartment and does not shuttle during oxidative stress. An identical FLIP experiment was conducted in cells treated with resveratrol. Similar to H2O2, a majority of nuclear FoxO1-GFP fluorescence was retained after the cytoplasmic signal was lost (Fig. 4B). We conclude that Sirtuin-deacetylated FoxO1 does not shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm but remains bound to the nuclear compartment. It appears that acetylation is a prerequisite for FoxO1 mobility between the two compartments. FoxO Is Immobile in Peroxide- or Resveratrol-treated Cells— The restriction of FoxO1 to the nuclear compartment during oxidative stress prompted us to look at FoxO1 kinetics within the nucleus using nuclear FRAP experiments. In serum-deprived cells, selectively photobleaching a strip within the nucleus resulted in prompt recovery of prebleaching fluorescence (t = <50 s) (Fig. 5). These data indicate that FoxO1-GFP is mobile within the nucleus in serum-deprived cells. In contrast, when we performed selective intranuclear photobleaching in H2O2-treated cells, fluorescence within the FRAP box failed to recover after >240 s as it did in resveratrol-treated cells (Fig. 5). Nuclear mobility of a protein can be retarded or hindered by its incorporation into a larger complex or by interactions with nuclear components that are relatively more immobile, such as chromatin (22Misteli T. Science. 2001; 291: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). To distinguish the kinetics of a protein-protein complex from a protein simply confined to the nucleus, we performed FRAP analysis in cells treated with Leptomycin-B, an inhibitor of nuclear export that has been shown to cause FoxO1 nuclear accumulation (23Biggs W.H. Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7421-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). FRAP analysis in Leptomycin-B-treated cells showed an immediate recovery of fluorescence within the photobleached region (Fig. 5). These data show that FoxO1-GFP is immobile within the nucleus during oxidative stress and resveratrol treatment. Sirtuin Activation and Hepatic Glucose Metabolism—Regulation of hepatic glucose production is an important physiologic function of FoxO1 (14Nakae J. Kitamura T. Silver D.L. Accili D. J. Clin.

Nature. 2003; 423: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). To correlate the changes in FoxO1 distribution with its biologic effects, we measured glucose production in H4IIE rat hepatoma cells following resveratrol or insulin treatment. Incubation of cells transduced with wild type FoxO1 adenovirus in glucose-free medium supplemented with the glucogenetic precursors lactate and pyruvate resulted in a time-dependent increase in the amount of glucose released in the culture medium. Insulin suppressed glucose production by ∼50%, whereas resveratrol increased it by ∼30% (Fig. 6A). To determine whether the effect of resveratrol was mediated by FoxO1, we transduced cells with constitutively nuclear (ADA) and dominant negative (Δ256) FoxO1 adenoviruses (14Nakae J. Kitamura T. Silver D.L. Accili D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Expression of ADA-FoxO1 completely blunted the effect of insulin without changing the response to resveratrol (Fig. 6B). In contrast, Δ256-FoxO1 decreased glucose release under all conditions tested (Fig. 6C). We next measured mRNA levels of the glucogenetic FoxO1 target genes glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1), as well as insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (Igfbp1). Resveratrol increased G6pc expression in cells expressing wild type and ADA-FoxO1, but not in cells expressing Δ256-FoxO1 (Fig. 6D). Unlike G6pc, Pck1 levels did not increase in response to resveratrol treatment in cells expressing wild type FoxO1 but did so in cells expressing ADA-FoxO1. The dominant negative Δ256-FoxO1 suppressed both basal and resveratrol-induced Pck1 expression (Fig. 6E). Igfbp1 expression patterns in response to the various treatments mirrored those of G6pc (Fig. 6F). These data are consistent with a model in which resveratrol increases glucose production by increasing FoxO1-dependent transcription of glucogenetic genes. It is noteworthy that resveratrol increased gene expression in cells expressing a constitutively nuclear FoxO1. These findings indicate that nuclear expression per se does not increase FoxO1-dependent transcription. Rather, there appears to be an additional resveratrol-dependent step required for FoxO1 activation, consistent with a role for deacetylation to increase FoxO1-mediated transcription. The present studies provide evidence for a deacetylation-based mechanism by which FoxO1 becomes tightly associated with a nuclear subdomain. This association with the nuclear compartment increases FoxO1-dependent transcription and is reflected in increased glucose release from cultured hepatoma cells. The main finding of this work is that Sirtuin activation by resveratrol or oxidative stress renders FoxO1 immobile within the nuclear compartment and promotes FoxO1-dependent transcription of genes important for hepatic glucose production. As Sirtuins have been shown to deacetylate FoxO proteins (4van der Horst A. Tertoolen L.G. de Vries-Smits L.M. Frye R.A. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. J. Biol.

The ability of oxidative stress, as well as resveratrol, to increase transcription mediated by a constitutively nuclear, phosphorylation-defective FoxO1 mutant (ADA) should be emphasized. These findings provide evidence that nuclear localization per se is necessary, but not sufficient, for full transcriptional activation by FoxO1 and are consistent with the nuclear FRAP experiments, indicating that FoxO1 is freely mobile within the nucleus under basal conditions but becomes restricted in resveratrol- or H2O2-treated cells.

We therefore propose that the definition of “constitutively nuclear” be adopted for this mutant. The effect of resveratrol could be mimicked in our experimental system by H2O2 treatment, a reagent that is commonly employed to induce oxidative stress by increasing intracellular concentrations of reactive oxygen species. It should be emphasized that the effects of H2O2 in cultured cells are complex. At early time points, H2O2 is known to have insulin-mimetic effects (31Heffetz D. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10126-10132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which include increased Akt activity and FoxO1 nuclear exclusion (18Nemoto S. Finkel T. Science. 2002; 295: 2450-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). With prolonged incubation, there is down-regulation of insulin signaling and FoxO1 localization becomes predominantly nuclear (5Brunet A. Sweeney L.B. Sturgill J.F. Chua K.F. Greer P.L. Lin Y.

Cell. 2004; 116: 551-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar), authors have found that deacetylation promotes FoxO-dependent transcription. However, these studies focused primarily on the effects of FoxO proteins on the cell cycle. The present data lend further support to the idea that deacetylation is a positive modulator of FoxO1 function by providing evidence that FoxO1-dependent regulation of hepatic glucose production is also affected by resveratrol, a small molecule activator of Sirtuins. Our findings are at odds with those of Motta et al. (11Motta M.C. Divecha N. Lemieux M. Kamel C. Chen D. Gu W. Bultsma Y. McBurney M. Guarente L. Cell. 2004; 116: 551-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar), who found increased G6pc and Pck1 expression in mice lacking Sirt1. However, it is unclear whether their data were obtained in fasted or fed mice. Moreover, as the Sirt1–/– mice were hyperglycemic, it is possible that the increase in Pck1 and G6pc is secondary to hyperglycemia rather than Sirt1 ablation. Further work will be required to establish a consensus on this point. Moreover, it should be noted that Sirt1 has also been shown to promote Pgc1α-dependent gluconeogenesis, a conclusion that is fully consistent with our findings (33Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Spiegelman B.M. Puigserver P. Nature. 2005; 434: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar). This is a key question if therapies based on Sirtuin modulation are to be pursued for the treatment of metabolic disorders. For example, if Sirtuin activation increases hepatic glucose production in vivo as it does in cultured cells, then hepatic Sirtuins should be inhibited to treat diabetes. On the other hand, in other tissues such as pancreatic β cells Sirtuin activation may indeed prove beneficial. Deacetylation of transcription factors is generally associated with reduced activity. For example, Sirt1-mediated deacetylation dampens p53-dependent transcription (34Vaziri H. Dessain S.K. Ng Eaton E. Imai S.I. Frye R.A. Pandita T.K. Guarente L. Weinberg R.A.

Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), but currently there is no information on its effect on p53 subnuclear kinetics. Conversely, it is unclear whether deacetylation affects FoxO-dependent transcription by altering its stability. The finding that deacetylation increases the nuclear residence time of FoxO seemingly supports the idea that deacetylation increases FoxO-dependent transcription, but it should be emphasized that the net outcome of this modification is likely to be rather complex as FoxO can be both an activator (27Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E.

However, the effects of exogenous ubiquinones can be difficult to interpret because they can also be pro-oxidants or electron carriers that facilitate respiration. Recently we developed a mitochondria-targeted ubiquinone (MitoQ10) that accumulates within mitochondria. MitoQ10 has been used to prevent mitochondrial oxidative damage and to infer the involvement of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in signaling pathways. However, uncertainties remain about the mitochondrial reduction of MitoQ10, its oxidation by the respiratory chain, and its pro-oxidant potential. Therefore, we compared MitoQ analogs of varying alkyl chain lengths (MitoQn, n = 3–15) with untargeted exogenous ubiquinones. We found that MitoQ10 could not restore respiration in ubiquinone-deficient mitochondria because oxidation of MitoQ analogs by complex III was minimal. Complex II and glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase reduced MitoQ analogs, and the rate depended on chain length. Because of its rapid reduction and negligible oxidation, MitoQ10 is a more effective antioxidant against lipid peroxidation, peroxynitrite and superoxide. Paradoxically, exogenous ubiquinols also autoxidize to generate superoxide, but this requires their deprotonation in the aqueous phase. Consequently, in the presence of phospholipid bilayers, the rate of autoxidation is proportional to ubiquinol hydrophilicity. Superoxide production by MitoQ10 was insufficient to damage aconitase but did lead to hydrogen peroxide production and nitric oxide consumption, both of which may affect cell signaling pathways. Our results comprehensively describe the interaction of exogenous ubiquinones with mitochondria and have implications for their rational design and use as therapies and as research tools to probe mitochondrial function.

When ROS production exceeds the capacity of detoxification and repair pathways, oxidative damage to protein, DNA, and phospholipid occurs, disrupting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and leading to cell damage and death. This contributes to a number of human pathologies including Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, Friedreich ataxia, ischemia-reperfusion injury, diabetes, and aging (2Duchen M.R. Mol. Aspects Med. 2004; 25: 365-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 3McKenzie M. Liolitsa D. Hanna M.G. Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29: 589-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition to this pathological role, ROS can also act as redox signaling molecules (4Droge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7532) Google Scholar, 5Finkel T. Curr. Opin.

Hence, mitochondrial ROS production and oxidative damage are attractive targets for pharmacological intervention for both therapeutic and investigative purposes (6Murphy M.P. Smith R.A. Adv.

Antioxidants have the potential to block oxidative damage and redox signaling, and exogenous ubiquinones have been widely used for this purpose in mitochondrial studies. These molecules are based on the predominant human form of endogenous ubiquinone, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10; Fig. 1A), which is synthesized in the mitochondrial inner membrane and comprises a ubiquinone head group attached to a tail of 10 five-carbon isoprenoid units (11Turunen M. Olsson J. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1660: 171-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). The ubiquinone moiety is redoxactive, accepting two electrons and two protons in its reduction to a ubiquinol, while the extremely hydrophobic tail ensures that within the cell it is almost exclusively associated with phospholipid bilayers (Fig. 1B). The redox activity of the ubiquinone moiety enables it to act as a mobile electron carrier in the mitochondrial inner membrane where it is reduced to a ubiquinol by several membrane bound dehydrogenases and oxidized back to a ubiquinone by complex III. Furthermore, the reduced ubiquinol form of CoQ10 has an important protective function as a chain breaking antioxidant, terminating lipid peroxidation in phospholipid bilayers (12Frei B. Kim M.C. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4879-4883Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 13James A.M. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Therefore, ubiquinone supplementation is an attractive therapeutic strategy in human pathology, as it could both stimulate oxidative phosphorylation by complementing any defects in respiration (14Marriage B.J. Clandinin M.T. Macdonald I.M. Glerum D.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 81: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and protect against oxidative damage (15Quiles J.L. Ochoa J.J. Huertas J.R. Mataix J. Exp. Gerontol. 2004; 39: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, this duality complicates experimental interpretation, as any effects of CoQ10 can result from its interaction with oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative damage, or redox signaling pathways. While positive therapeutic effects have been observed with CoQ10 supplementation in humans (16Abe K. Matsuo Y. Kadekawa J. Inoue S. Yanagihara T. J. Neurol.

Consequently, only a small fraction of orally administered CoQ10 reaches the circulatory system, and augmentation of mitochondrial CoQ10 content is lower still (20Zhang Y. Turunen M. Appelkvist E.L.

The negligible water solubility of CoQ10 and its poor diffusion to mitochondria in cultured cells also hinder its usefulness as a tool to study mitochondrial oxidative damage and redox signaling in vitro. As a result there is considerable interest in developing artificial ubiquinones with better bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties. Idebenone is one such compound and it comprises a ubiquinone head group attached to a ten carbon alkyl tail with a terminal hydroxyl (Fig. 1A) (25Suno M. Nagaoka A. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1984; 35: 196-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Clinical trials with idebenone have shown it can ameliorate cardiomyopathy in Friedreich ataxia patients (26Rustin P. Rotig A.

Neurology. 2003; 60: 1676-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Although decreasing hydrophobicity improves overall bioavailability, it would also be of benefit to target ubiquinones specifically to mitochondria, as they are the main site of ubiquinone utilization but represent only a small fraction of the cell volume. Lipophilic cations, such as methyltriphenylphosphonium (TPMP; Fig. 1A), are accumulated several hundred-fold by the large membrane potential (negative inside) generated by mitochondria during oxidative phosphorylation (6Murphy M.P.

The interaction of amphipathic alkyltriphenylphosphonium cations with phospholipid bilayers occurs as follows: the TPP lipophilic cation is bound as a monolayer in a potential well at about the level of the phospholipid fatty acid carbonyls, while the hydrophobic alkyl chain is inserted into the hydrophobic core of the membrane (31Smith R.A.

Although the large ionic radius and hydrophobicity of the TPP cation allows molecules such as MitoQ10 to permeate phospholipid bilayers readily, their steady-state concentration within the hydrophobic core of the membrane is low. Furthermore, within energized mitochondria the membrane potential causes most MitoQ10 to be adsorbed to the matrix surface of the inner membrane. MitoQ10 is a particularly effective antioxidant against lipid peroxidation (29Kelso G.F. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Hughes G. Porteous W.K. Ledgerwood E.C. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. J. Biol.

However, the details of the mitochondrial processes affected by MitoQ10 remain unclear because it could act as an antioxidant (thereby blocking oxidative damage and redox signaling) or as an electron carrier in the respiratory chain (thereby stimulating oxidative phosphorylation). A further consideration is that, while ubiquinols are potent antioxidants, there are also partially reduced and/or partially protonated intermediate forms that can act as pro-oxidants through interacting with oxygen to form superoxide ((O2−)) (13James A.M. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 43Rich P.R. Bendall D.S.

The implications of autoxidation are unclear as stress response pathways that boost antioxidant defenses are often switched on by mild oxidative stress (a process termed hormesis). As a result autoxidation could paradoxically contribute to conditioning and protection against subsequent oxidative stress (4Droge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7532) Google Scholar, 45Kaiser J. Science. 2003; 302: 376-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 46Calabrese E.J. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: S37-S40Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In summary, ubiquinone augmentation is an attractive therapy for degenerative diseases as it has the potential to both stimulate oxidative phosphorylation and protect against lipid peroxidation. However this combination of effects makes interpretation difficult, limiting the design of rational therapies. Furthermore, while MitoQ10 has been widely used to infer the existence of mitochondrial ROS-dependent signaling pathways, aspects of its mechanism of action remain uncertain. To clarify these issues, we set out to determine how MitoQ10 and a number of related short-chain exogenous ubiquinones interact with both the mitochondrial respiratory chain and ROS. For this we used a range of MitoQ analogs that differ in the number of carbons linking the ubiquinone to the TPP moiety (MitoQn; n = 3, 5, 10, or 15 CH2 groups) (29Kelso G.F. Porteous C.M.

This work has led to a better understanding of how MitoQ and other exogenous ubiquinones interact with the respiratory chain and ROS and has considerable implications for their rational design and use as therapies and as tools to probe mitochondrial oxidative damage and redox signaling. Yeast Incubations—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used were WT (CEN.PK2–1C MATa his3 leu2 trp1 ura3) and ΔCOQ2 (CEN.PK2–1C coq2::HIS3), kindly supplied by Prof. Catherine Clarke, UCLA (47Hsu A.Y. Do T.Q. Lee P.T. Clarke C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Coq2 codes for the enzyme para-hydroxybenzoate:hexaprenyl transferase, which catalyzes the transfer of the polyisoprenoid chain to 4-hydroxybenzoic acid in CoQ biosynthesis. ΔCOQ2 is auxotrophic for CoQ and fails to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources, such as glycerol. Yeast were cultured in 10 ml of YPG (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 3% (v/v) glycerol). The initial cell density was adjusted to A600 ∼0.1. To achieve a reproducible transition to a respiratory phenotype, the medium was supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) glucose. This allowed fermentative growth of ΔCOQ2 up to A600 ∼0.4 after which growth rapidly ceased unless ubiquinone supplementation restored oxidative phosphorylation. Yeast were incubated in the dark at 30 °C with mechanical shaking at 250 rpm. Growth was monitored spectrophotometrically by measuring A600 over 120 h. For all yeast experiments, ubiquinones and other hydrophobic compounds were added in Me2SO to 1% (v/v) of the total culture volume, which did not affect the growth of the WT and ΔCOQ2 strains on glucose (data not shown). ΔCOQ2 yeast cultures for mitochondrial isolation were grown aerobically at 30 °C to mid-logarithmic phase (A600 ∼1) in lactate medium (2% (v/v) dl-lactic acid, 0.3% yeast extract, 0.2% glucose, 0.05% CaCl2·2H2O, 0.05% NaCl, 0.06% MgCl2·6H2O, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.1% NH4Cl (all w/v) (pH 5.5, NaOH). ΔCOQ2 yeast can use d-lactate as a respiratory substrate because it donates electrons to oxidative phosphorylation at complex IV via the reduction of cytochrome c (cyt c). For WT yeast, the level of glucose was kept at 0.05% (w/v). Mitochondria were isolated according to published protocols (48Diekert K. de Kroon A.I. Kispal G. Lill R.

The protein concentration was measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay using BSA as a standard (50Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the mitochondrial preparation were mixed with 10 mg·ml–1 fatty acid-free BSA as a cryoprotectant, snap-frozen on dry ice, and stored at –80 °C. Upon thawing the mitochondria retained a membrane potential that was indistinguishable from that of freshly isolated yeast mitochondria as confirmed by the uncoupler-sensitive uptake of [3H]TPMP (data not shown) (29Kelso G.F. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Hughes G. Porteous W.K. Ledgerwood E.C. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4588-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption was measured with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Rank Brothers, Bottisham, Cambridge, UK) in a 1-ml stirred chamber at 30 °C. Aliquots of frozen ΔCOQ2 yeast mitochondria were thawed rapidly, washed, and resuspended in mannitol buffer (0.6 m mannitol, 10 mm Tris maleate, 5 mm KPi, 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 6.8, KOH)) at 0.2 mg protein·ml–1. The mitochondria were energized with 5 mm glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) and uncoupled with 1 μm carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). Ubiquinones (1–20 μm in Me2SO) were titrated in successively, followed by 1 μm myxothiazol to determine non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption. For some experiments mitochondria were sonicated (3 × 5 s, setting 4; Misonix XL-2020 with microtip) in an ice bath prior to the measurement of respiration and addition of ubiquinone. Uptake of MitoQ analogs by yeast mitochondria was measured using an electrode selective for TPP cations (30Asin-Cayuela J. Manas A.-R.B. James A.M. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). For these experiments WT yeast mitochondria (0.4 mg protein·ml–1) were incubated in 2.5 ml of mannitol buffer in the presence of 2 μm MitoQ analog at 30 °C, and the uptake of MitoQ in response to energization with 5 mm ethanol was measured. Mammalian Mitochondrial Preparations—Bovine heart mitochondrial membranes (BHM) were prepared from isolated bovine heart mitochondria as described previously (51Smith A.L.

Protein concentration was determined using the biuret assay with BSA as a standard (54Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol.

Ubiquinone Reduction and Oxidation by Respiratory Complexes— Assays were based on previously described methods for measuring respiratory complex activity (55James A.M. Wei Y.H. Pang C.Y. Murphy M.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, for all assays except complex III the spectrophotometric decrease in A275 (at this wavelength ubiquinone absorbs more strongly than ubiquinol) was monitored instead. Assays were performed in KPi buffer (50 mm KPi-KOH, 100 μm EDTA, 100 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (pH 7.8) unless stated otherwise) at 37 °C. For complex I, the buffer was supplemented with 100 μg protein·ml–1 BHM, 100 μm NADH, and 2 mm KCN, and the reaction was started by addition of 50 μm ubiquinone. For complex II, the buffer was supplemented with 100 μg protein·ml–1 BHM, 5 mm succinate, 8 μg·ml–1 rotenone, and 2 mm KCN, and the reaction was started by addition of 50 μm ubiquinone. For glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH), EDTA and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) were omitted as Ca2+ may be required for activity (56Garrib A. McMurray W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8042-8048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the buffer was supplemented with 200 μg protein·ml–1 BHM, 2 mm KCN, and 50 μm ubiquinone. The reaction was started with the addition of 10 mm G3P. Rotenone (8 μg·ml–1) and malonate (20 mm) did not affect the rate of ubiquinone reduction in the presence of G3P. For complex III, the buffer was supplemented with 50 μg protein·ml–1 BHM, 50 μm bovine cyt c, 8 μg·ml–1 rotenone, and 2 mm KCN, plus or minus 400 nm myxothiazol. The reaction was started with the addition of 50 μm ubiquinol, and cyt c reduction was measured by an increase at A550 (55James A.M. Wei Y.H. Pang C.Y. Murphy M.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The myxothiazol-insensitive rate was measured in parallel and subtracted as there is a significant non-enzymatic rate of cyt c reduction by ubiquinols (43Rich P.R. Bendall D.S. FEBS Lett. 1979; 105: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Measurement of the Ubiquinone Redox State—Spectrophotometric measurements were made at 275 nm. The ubiquinone redox state was measured at 37 °C in KPi buffer supplemented with 100 μg protein·ml–1 BHM, 8 μg·ml–1 rotenone, and 10 μm ubiquinone. BHM were also supplemented with 5 μm bovine cyt c, as this can be lost during membrane isolation. For succinate (5 mm) oxidation, fumarase (5 units·ml–1) was also added as fumarate absorbs at A275 (local maximum at 240 nm). Furthermore, a background trace in the absence of ubiquinone was subtracted as fumarase does not completely abolish fumarate accumulation. For NADH oxidation, NADH absorption interfered with ubiquinone redox changes at A275, therefore an NADH regeneration system (5"
https://openalex.org/W2056801328,"The inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein survivin is highly expressed in cancers, but not in normal differentiated tissues. TCF/β-catenin signaling has been reported to participate in the regulation of survivin transcription in colon cancer. We have recently characterized ICG-001, a small molecule specific inhibitor of the β-catenin/Creb-binding protein (CBP) interaction. Inhibition of the β-catenin/CBP interaction represses a subset of TCF/β-catenin-mediated transcription. ICG-001 potently inhibits survivin gene transcription and expression. ICG-001-mediated downregulation of survivin expression enhanced caspase-3 activity and apoptosis, which was rescued by overexpression of wild type but not mutant (C84A) survivin. Small interfering RNA and genetic reduction of CBP also decreased survivin expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that CBP is the crucial coactivator for TCF/β-catenin-mediated survivin transcription. Furthermore, ICG-001-induced recruitment of p300 to the survivin promoter led to concomitant recruitment of SUMO-1, HDAC6 and PML proteins, which have been associated with transcriptional repression. These findings demonstrate that CBP and p300 play very distinct roles in survivin gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2027922843,"Multidrug resistance is a potent barrier to effective, long term therapy in cancer patients. It is frequently attributed to enhanced expression of multidrug transporters or to the action of receptor kinases, such as ErbB2, and downstream anti-apoptotic signaling pathways, such as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway. However, very few connections have been made between receptor kinases or anti-apoptotic pathways and multidrug transporter expression or function. Data presented herein show that constitutive interaction of the pericellular polysaccharide, hyaluronan, with its receptor, CD44, regulates assembly and activation of an ErbB2-containing signaling complex, which in turn stimulates phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity in multidrug-resistant MCF-7/Adr human breast carcinoma cells. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase activates Akt and downstream anti-apoptotic events, which contribute to drug resistance. However, hyaluronan and phosphoinositide 3-kinase stimulate expression of the multidrug transporter, MDR1 (P-glycoprotein), in an interdependent, but Akt-independent, manner. Furthermore, constitutively active phosphoinositide 3-kinase, but not Akt, stimulates hyaluronan production. These Akt-independent effects are dominant over the effects of Akt on doxorubicin resistance in MCF-7/Adr cells. Thus hyaluronan, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and ErbB2 form a positive feedback loop that strongly amplifies MDR1 expression and regulates drug resistance in these cells.

Hyaluronan, a very large polysaccharide composed of repeating disaccharides of glucuronate and N-acetylglucosamine, is a ubiquitous component of extracellular matrices. In many adult tissues the major function of hyaluronan is structural, but in developing and remodeling tissues hyaluronan plays a crucial, instructive, signal-transducing role (8Turley E.A.

Hyaluronan is also a major component of the pericellular matrices within tumors and it influences the activity of tumor cell signaling pathways that are important in development of malignant cellular properties (11Toole B.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). However, these relationships are complex, since very high hyaluronan concentrations may inhibit rather than promote tumor progression (12Itano N. Sawai T. Atsumi F. Miyaishi O. Taniguchi S.

Furthermore, increased hyaluronan production stimulates drug resistance in human breast carcinoma cells, whereas inhibition of constitutive hyaluronan-tumor cell interactions sensitizes multidrug-resistant cells to several chemotherapeutic drugs (20Misra S.

In this study we have investigated possible interrelationships between hyaluronan, PI3K, ErbB2, and expression of MDR1 (P-glycoprotein) in MCF-7 and multidrug-resistant MCF-7/Adr human breast carcinoma cells. We have found that hyaluronan acts upstream and downstream of PI3K and that both hyaluronan and PI3K stimulate MDR1 expression and induce drug resistance in an interdependent, but Akt-independent, manner. We have also found that hyaluronan regulates activation of ErbB2, which in turn stimulates PI3K activity in these cells. This positive feedback loop is most likely critical in the regulation of multidrug resistance and other malignant characteristics of breast cancer cells.

Unless specified, all other reagents were the highest grade from Sigma. Cell Lines and Transfectants—MCF-7/Adr human mammary carcinoma cells were obtained from Dr. K. Cowan, University of Nebraska. Transient transfections were carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturer's instructors (Invitrogen). Stable transfectants were prepared using linearized plasmids with Lipofectamine 2000 and selected using G418 (23Yu Q. Toole B.P. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1985-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cell lines were routinely maintained in complete medium, i.e. RPMI plus Glutamax I medium (Invitrogen), containing 4.5 g/ml glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, and an additional 1 mm glutamine (Invitrogen). The cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and passaged every 3–4 days. Recombinant Adenoviruses—Recombinant adenoviruses, driving expression of β-galactosidase, Has2, soluble CD44, or the link module of brevican were prepared as described previously (24Li R. Huang L.

Walsh, Boston University (27Fujio Y. Guo K. Mano T. Mitsuuchi Y. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5073-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 6-well plates and allowed to grow under routine conditions until ∼70% confluent. The growth medium was then replaced with serum-free medium. The cells were infected with the adenovirus constructs at 200–300 multiplicity of infection per cell by incubation for 90 min with intermittent gentle rocking. The virus-containing medium was removed and replaced with 3 ml per well of complete serum-containing medium. The cultures were then incubated at 37 °C overnight and transferred to 150-mm dishes before use. RNA Silencing—siRNA for human CD44 was designed as described previously (18Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8875-8883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The nonspecific control IX RNA was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Cells were transfected with the siRNA in 2 ml of complete medium in 6-well plates with cells at 70–90% confluence. Transfections were performed with 200 pmol of siRNA, using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer's instructions. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h and replated in 150-mm dishes before use. Assays for Cell Survival/Doxorubicin Sensitivity, Inhibition of ErbB2 Activity, PI3K Activity, and Hyaluronan Concentration—For analysis of sensitivity to doxorubicin treatment, cells were plated in 24-well plates (Corning) in complete serum-containing medium. After overnight incubation, various concentrations of doxorubicin (10 nm to 100 μm) plus other reagents as specified were added to the cultures, followed by further incubation for 72 h. The cultures were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline to remove dead cells, harvested by trypsinization, and cell numbers measured in a Coulter Counter. For inhibition of ErbB2, cells were preincubated in serum-free complete medium for 24 h, then in 10 mm NaN3 and 10 mm deoxyglucose in glucose-free RPMI medium for 30 min to slow metabolism, after which they were treated with 0.0–2.0 μm AG825, lysed, and immunoblotted. PI3K activity was measured in cell lysates as described previously (19Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38013-38020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan was measured in cell medium, collected after incubation for 24 h, by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like procedure described previously (28Gordon L.B. Harten I.A. Calabro A. Sugumaran G. Csoka A.B. Brown W.T. Hascall V. Toole B.P. Hum. Genet. 2003; 113: 178-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—Cell lysates were prepared and processed for immunoprecipitation with antibodies against ErbB2 or the p85 subunit of PI3K as described previously (18Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8875-8883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Western blots were carried out with cell lysates or immunoprecipitates as described previously (18Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8875-8883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were quantified by densitometry. Hyaluronan Regulates Drug Resistance—In a previous study we demonstrated that small hyaluronan oligosaccharides (oligomers) sensitize drug-resistant breast carcinoma cells to several different chemotherapeutic drugs (20Misra S. Ghatak S. Zoltan-Jones A. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25285-25288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Our interpretation of these results was that the oligomers antagonize constitutive hyaluronan polymer-CD44 interaction by competitively replacing a multivalent, signal-transducing interaction with a monovalent, non-signaling interaction (11Toole B.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). However, other interpretations are possible, e.g. the oligomers might signal directly through another receptor (8Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 29Noble P.W. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Thus, to confirm that perturbation of constitutive hyaluronan interactions inhibits drug resistance, we used two other antagonists of hyaluronan-CD44 interactions, i.e. soluble CD44 and the hyaluronan-binding link module of brevican, both of which act as competitive decoys for binding endogenous hyaluronan (11Toole B.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar, 25Ward J.A. Huang L. Guo H. Ghatak S. Toole B.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1403-1409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We found that both reagents sensitize multidrug-resistant MCF-7/Adr breast carcinoma cells to doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 1A). To demonstrate that hyaluronan-CD44 interaction is specifically involved, we used an siRNA that blocks CD44 expression by 70–90% (18Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8875-8883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This reagent was also found to sensitize MCF-7/Adr cells to doxorubicin to a similar degree to the hyaluronan oligomers (Fig. 1B). In addition to using hyaluronan antagonists, we determined the effect of increased hyaluronan synthesis. We stimulated hyaluronan synthesis rather than adding exogenous hyaluronan, since the latter does not necessarily mimic the cellular localization and interactions available to endogenously produced hyaluronan (11Toole B.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar, 30Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), and since, in a previous study, we showed that up-regulation of hyaluronan synthesis stimulates ErbB2 phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells, whereas addition of exogenous hyaluronan does not (18Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8875-8883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus, we infected the parental, drug-sensitive MCF-7 cells with a recombinant Has2 adenovirus that induces ∼5-fold increase in hyaluronan production (26Zoltan-Jones A. Huang L. Ghatak S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45801-45810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and showed that this treatment causes increased resistance to doxorubicin in the MCF-7 cells. This effect was reversed by concomitant treatment with hyaluronan oligomers (Fig. 1C). Thus we conclude that hyaluronan-CD44 interaction regulates doxorubicin resistance in these cells. Hyaluronan and PI3K Cooperatively Regulate Drug Resistance in an Akt-independent Manner—Numerous studies have shown that PI3K activity increases drug resistance, and it has been widely assumed that this is due to the downstream anti-apoptotic effects of the PI3K/Akt cell survival pathway (3West K.A. Castillo S.S. Dennis P.A. Drug Resist. Updat. 2002; 5: 234-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). We have shown that hyaluronan constitutively regulates the PI3K/Akt pathway (19Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38013-38020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 20Misra S. Ghatak S. Zoltan-Jones A. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25285-25288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 26Zoltan-Jones A. Huang L. Ghatak S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45801-45810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and so we sought evidence for the postulate that hyaluronan regulates drug resistance via its effects on the PI3K/Akt pathway. To do this we prepared MCF-7/Adr cells that express dominant-negative and constitutively active forms of PI3K and Akt. We manipulated PI3K activity levels by stable or transient transfection with the relevant constructs. We manipulated Akt activity by transient transfection or by infection with adenoviruses expressing the constructs. We showed that each of the dominant-negative constructs of PI3K or Akt inhibits Akt phosphorylation and that the constitutively active constructs of PI3K and Akt stimulate Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2, A and B). We also showed that the PI3K transfections had the expected effects on PI3K activity (Fig. 2C). Since the different methods of delivering the dominant-negative and constitutively active constructs gave similar results, we used stable transfection with the PI3K constructs and recombinant adenoviral delivery of the Akt constructs for most of the subsequent experiments. We then examined the effects of these manipulations on doxorubicin sensitivity. We found that dominant-negative PI3K sensitizes the cells by at least 2 orders of magnitude, whereas the constitutively active PI3K increases resistance in these already resistant cells by another order of magnitude (Fig. 2D). However, the Akt constructs showed much smaller effects (Fig. 2E); we used both transient transfection and adenoviral delivery in several experiments, but the effects obtained were always less than 10-fold. Thus, even though the PI3K constructs and the Akt constructs have very similar effects on Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2, A and B), only the PI3K constructs elicit strong effects on drug resistance. Consequently, we conclude that a large part of the effect of PI3K on drug resistance is Akt-independent. We then analyzed the effects of manipulating hyaluronan interactions on doxorubicin sensitivity in the PI3K and Akt transfectants. We found that the highly resistant, constitutively active PI3K transfectant was no longer susceptible to the usual dose of hyaluronan oligomers, i.e. 100 μg/ml (Fig. 3A). However, treatment with soluble CD44 or with CD44 siRNA still sensitized the cells to doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 3A). Since hyaluronan oligomers interact with CD44 with low affinity (31Underhill C.B. Chi-Rosso G. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8086-8091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lesley J. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. Hyman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26967-26975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we used higher doses of oligomers and found that these doses sensitize the cells to doxorubicin (Fig. 3B). Thus, we conclude that the increased doxorubicin resistance caused by constitutively active PI3K is dependent on endogenous hyaluronan-CD44 interaction. We also found that experimentally increasing hyaluronan production in the dominant-negative PI3K transfectant partially reverses its increased sensitivity to doxorubicin (Fig. 3C) and that hyaluronan oligomers sensitize both the constitutively active and dominant-negative Akt transfectants in similar fashion to non-transfected cells (Fig. 3D). Constitutively Active PI3K, but Not Akt, Stimulates Hyaluronan Production—As shown in the previous section, larger amounts of hyaluronan oligomers are required to inhibit doxorubicin resistance in the constitutively active PI3K-MCF-7/Adr transfectant than in non-transfected or vector-transfected MCF-7/Adr cells. Thus we considered the possibility that PI3K stimulates hyaluronan production, in which case higher levels of oligomer would be required to compete for interaction with endogenous CD44. We found that constitutively active PI3K greatly stimulates hyaluronan production, whereas constitutively active Akt does not; the dominant-negative PI3K and Akt both exhibit modest inhibitory effects (Fig. 4). As stated above, we have previously shown that hyaluronan stimulates PI3K activity (20Misra S. Ghatak S. Zoltan-Jones A. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25285-25288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 26Zoltan-Jones A. Huang L. Ghatak S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45801-45810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The results obtained here show that PI3K stimulates hyaluronan production, thus establishing a positive feedback loop that would augment the action of these agents. Hyaluronan and PI3K, but Not Akt, Regulate Expression of MDR1 (P-glycoprotein)—Since Akt activity appears to play a minor role in doxorubicin resistance in the MCF-7/Adr cells, we explored the possibility that PI3K and hyaluronan, but not Akt, affect levels of multidrug transporter expression in these cells. First we confirmed that MCF-7/Adr cells express higher levels of MDR1 than the parental MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5 lane 1 in A versus lane 1 in B). We then showed that treatment with hyaluronan oligomers reduces constitutive MDR1 expression in the MCF-7/Adr cells (Fig. 5A, lane 2) and that increased hyaluronan production increases MDR1 expression in the MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5B, lane 2); the latter effect is reversed by co-treatment with hyaluronan oligomers (Fig. 5B, lane 3). Similar effects on expression of another multidrug transporter, MRP2, were also observed, i.e. increased hyaluronan induced expression of MRP2 in MCF-7 cells, and treatment with hyaluronan oligomers suppressed expression of MRP2 in MCF-7/Adr cells (data not shown). We also found that constitutively active PI3K increases MDR1 expression (Fig. 5A, lane 3) and that soluble CD44 and CD44 siRNA reverse this increase (Fig. 5A, lanes 5 and 6). The usual dose of hyaluronan oligomers, i.e. 100 μg/ml, was only partially effective (Fig. 5A, lane 4, and Fig. 5C, lane 2), but higher doses strongly reverse the effect of constitutively active PI3K (Fig. 5C, lanes 4 and 5). Dominant-negative PI3K inhibits MDR1 expression in the MCF-7/Adr cells (Fig. 5, lane 4 in B versus lane 1 in A), but this inhibition is reversed by increased hyaluronan production (Fig. 5B, lane 5). Although manipulation of PI3K and hyaluronan-CD44 interaction has these large effects on MDR1 expression, manipulation of Akt activity has little effect (Fig. 5D). The results described here closely match the effects of hyaluronan, PI3K, and Akt on sensitivity to doxorubicin (Fig. 2, D and E, and Fig. 3). Thus we conclude that the Akt-independent effects of PI3K on doxorubicin sensitivity are most likely due to its effects on multidrug transporter expression and that hyaluronan-CD44 interaction is required for the effects of PI3K. Hyaluronan Constitutively Activates ErbB2 in MCF-7/Adr Cells—ErbB2 has been implicated in induction of drug resistance in several tumor types, at least in part through activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway (5Chen J.S. Lan K. Hung M.C. Drug Resist. Updat. 2003; 6: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan activates ErbB2 (14Bourguignon L.Y. Zhu H. Zhou B. Diedrich F. Singleton P.A. Hung M.C. J.

Hamaguchi M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) in various transformed and carcinoma cells. Since, as found herein, hyaluronan and PI3K cooperatively regulate drug resistance in MCF-7/Adr cells, and since MCF-7/Adr cells express high levels of activated ErbB2, we determined the extent to which ErbB2 is responsible for PI3K activity in these cells. We did this by measuring Akt phosphorylation at various concentrations of the ErbB2 inhibitor, AG825, and found that at >95% inhibition of ErbB2 activity, ∼50% phosphorylation of Akt was inhibited (Fig. 6). Thus we conclude that ∼50% of PI3K activity in the MCF-7/Adr cells is due to ErbB2 activation. We then determined whether hyaluronan regulates constitutive ErbB2 activity in the MCF-7/Adr cells by treating the cells with and without hyaluronan oligomers, soluble CD44, or CD44 siRNA. We immunoprecipitated ErbB2 or the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K from lysates of these cells and immunoblotted for activated (phosphorylated) ErbB2 and total (phosphorylated plus non-phosphorylated) ErbB2. We used antibodies against p85 as well as ErbB2 for immunoprecipitation since p85 forms a complex with ErbB2 (18Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8875-8883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 7A, the hyaluronan antagonists inhibit phosphorylation of ErbB2 by 55–90%. We have recently found that hyaluronan constitutively regulates assembly of a lipid raft-associated complex, containing activated ErbB2, CD44, PI3K, ezrin, and the chaperones, Hsp90 and cdc37, in HCT116 human colon and TA3/St murine mammary carcinoma cells (18Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8875-8883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus we determined whether endogenous hyaluronan induces this complex in MCF-7/Adr cells by measuring the effects of hyaluronan antagonists on its assembly. We found that such a complex could be immunoprecipitated from MCF-7/Adr cell lysates with antibody against ErbB2 or the p85 subunit of PI3K and that hyaluronan antagonists inhibit its assembly (Fig. 7B). We conclude from these results that regulation of PI3K activity by hyaluronan in MCF-7/Adr cells is at least in part mediated by constitutive, hyaluronan-induced activation of ErbB2. Conclusions—The major findings of this and our previous studies of breast epithelial and carcinoma cells (18Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8875-8883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 19Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 45801-45810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) are: (a) that hyaluronan acts both upstream and downstream of PI3K, (b) that hyaluronan and PI3K stimulate expression of MDR1 in an interdependent, but Akt-independent, manner, and (c) that hyaluronan regulates activation of ErbB2, which in turn stimulates PI3K activity. These results indicate that a positive feedback loop, involving hyaluronan, PI3K and ErbB2, augments the action of these agents and is most likely critical in the regulation of multidrug resistance and other malignant characteristics in breast carcinoma cells. This loop is diagrammed in Fig. 8. Thus we propose that, through interaction with CD44, hyaluronan constitutively induces assembly of an ErbB2-containing signaling complex that stimulates the PI3K/Akt and other pathways. It is possible that a similar phenomenon occurs with other receptor kinases, such as c-MET (34Kamikura D.M. Khoury H. Maroun C. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3482-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and TGF-β receptor 1 (35Bourguignon L.Y. Singleton P.A. Zhu H. Zhou B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39703-39712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Downstream anti-apoptotic events in the PI3K/Akt pathway clearly play a role in drug resistance (3West K.A. Castillo S.S. Dennis P.A. Drug Resist. Updat. 2002; 5: 234-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), but our data indicate that, at least in MCF-7/Adr cells, a more important effect of PI3K may be Akt-independent stimulation of multidrug transporter expression. In the case of MCF-7/Adr cells, both MDR1 and MRP2 are induced by PI3K. A recent study showed that PI3K was also responsible for stimulation of MRP1 expression in prostate carcinoma cells, but this study did not address whether this effect was Akt-dependent or -independent (7Lee Jr., J.T. Steelman L.S. McCubrey J.A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8397-8404Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). At this time it is not clear whether PI3K stimulates multidrug transporter expression directly. We observed that constitutively active PI3K requires endogenous hyaluronan for its effect on transporter expression. This dependence may be due to the positive feedback amplification of PI3K activity by hyaluronan, but this would only be the case if this amplification outweighed the contribution of the constitutively active PI3K introduced into the cells. Thus it seems more likely that hyaluronan stimulates transporter expression via another pathway and that PI3K contributes by amplifying hyaluronan expression. Recent studies suggest that hyaluronan may interact directly with drug transporters as well as influence their expression (36Ouskova G. Spellerberg B. Prehm P. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 37Prehm P. Schumacher U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our current studies are directed toward determining the pathways whereby hyaluronan and PI3K collaborate in the induction of multidrug resistance and other malignant properties. These results highlight the potential importance of hyaluronan as a therapeutic target in multidrug-resistant carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2010082441,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel human coronavirus. Viral maturation requires a main protease (3CL(pro)) to cleave the virus-encoded polyproteins. We report here that the 3CL(pro) containing additional N- and/or C-terminal segments of the polyprotein sequences undergoes autoprocessing and yields the mature protease in vitro. The dimeric three-dimensional structure of the C145A mutant protease shows that the active site of one protomer binds with the C-terminal six amino acids of the protomer from another asymmetric unit, mimicking the product-bound form and suggesting a possible mechanism for maturation. The P1 pocket of the active site binds the Gln side chain specifically, and the P2 and P4 sites are clustered together to accommodate large hydrophobic side chains. The tagged C145A mutant protein served as a substrate for the wild-type protease, and the N terminus was first digested (55-fold faster) at the Gln(-1)-Ser1 site followed by the C-terminal cleavage at the Gln306-Gly307 site. Analytical ultracentrifuge of the quaternary structures of the tagged and mature proteases reveals the remarkably tighter dimer formation for the mature enzyme (K(d) = 0.35 nm) than for the mutant (C145A) containing 10 extra N-terminal (K(d) = 17.2 nM) or C-terminal amino acids (K(d) = 5.6 nM). The data indicate that immature 3CL(pro) can form dimer enabling it to undergo autoprocessing to yield the mature enzyme, which further serves as a seed for facilitated maturation. Taken together, this study provides insights into the maturation process of the SARS 3CL(pro) from the polyprotein and design of new structure-based inhibitors."

In vitro, a soluble form of Nectin-4 is produced in the supernatant of breast tumor cell lines (S. Fabre-Lafay, C. Ginestier, S. Garrido-Urbani, C. Berruyer, R. Sauvan, N. Reymond, J. Adélaide, J. Geneix, P. Dubreuil, J. Jacquemier, D. Birnbaum, and M. Lopez, manuscript in preparation). We have investigated the mechanisms that regulate the production of this soluble form. It was found that the soluble form of Nectin-4 detected in the sera of patients and the supernatant of breast tumor cell lines share similar biochemical and immunological features. The soluble Nectin-4 form (43 kDa) is formed by the entire Nectin-4 ectodomain. Nectin-4 shedding is constitutive, strongly enhanced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate activation, and reduced tumor necrosis factor-α protease inhibitor TAPI-1 or by the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3). TAPI-1 and TIMP-3 are inhibitors of the endoprotease tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE)/ADAM-17. Overexpression or small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of TACE enhanced or reduced Nectin-4 shedding, respectively. Nectin-4 is not shed when expressed in TACE-deficient fibroblasts. Interestingly, the active form of TACE is overexpressed in breast tumors and may indicate that TACE is responsible for Nectin-4 shedding not only in vitro but also in vivo.

It is a new valuable serum marker for breast carcinoma. 1S. Fabre-Lafay, C. Ginestier, S. Garrido-Urbani, C. Berruyer, R. Sauvan, N. Reymond, J. Adélaide, J. Geneix, P. Dubreuil, J. Jacquemier, D.

Indeed, a soluble form of Nectin-4 is produced in the supernatant of breast tumor cell lines, and a circulating form of Nectin-4 is detected in the sera of patients with metastatic breast carcinoma. Cancer serum markers result from cell surface shedding from the tumor from which they originate. Ectodomain shedding is a major process regulating various biological events such as cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, and survival. Various proteins such as growth factors, growth factor receptors, or cell adhesion molecules are substrates for sheddases. Among the Zn2+-dependent protease superfamily, matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) 2The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloprotease; TACE, tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PMA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; TAPI-1, tumor necrosis factor-α protease inhibitor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TM, transmembrane; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase. 2The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloprotease; TACE, tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PMA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; TAPI-1, tumor necrosis factor-α protease inhibitor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TM, transmembrane; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase. and ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) proteins, both members of the metzincin subgroup, are largely implicated in the degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (12Chang C.

In the present study we show that the soluble form of Nectin-4 found in the supernatant and in patient sera have similar immunological and biochemical characteristics suggesting that they result from a common mechanism. Using breast tumor cell lines expressing endogenous Nectin-4 and Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) cells transfected with Nectin-4, we demonstrate that this mechanism is an active proteolytic process involving the TACE/ADAM-17 metalloprotease. We show that the active form of TACE is overexpressed in breast tumor samples, suggesting that TACE could also be involved in the shedding of Nectin-4 in vivo. Cells and Culture Conditions—Chinese CHO and human ductal breast carcinoma cells T47D or MDAMB-231 were cultivated in 45% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 45% CHO medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum), 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Clonal fibroblast cell lines derived from a TACE-deficient mouse (TACE -/- EC2 cells, Amgen) was cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were cultivated in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at constant humidity. Cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Materials—12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (PMA) was purchased from Sigma, and GM6001 and tumor necrosis factor-α protease inhibitor (TAPI-1) inhibitors were purchased from Chemicon International and Peptide International respectively. Recombinant tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1, TIMP-2, and TIMP-3 were from R&D systems. Normal breast tissue lysates were purchased from ΨProSci and Abcam. DNA Transfection—CHO or MDAMB-231 cells grown to 50–80% confluency were transfected with the appropriate cDNA expression plasmids (FLAG-tagged Nectin-4 (p3XFLR4.C1) (31Fabre S. Reymond N. Cocchi F.

Nagata S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2074-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)) by using the Fu GENE™ 6 or the Polyfect™ reagent method. The cells were cultivated for 1 day, and the medium was replaced. When necessary, cells were selected in the presence of G418 to establish stable transfectants. The TACE -/- EC2 cell line was transfected with Nectin-4 cDNA and selected with 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin. Reverse Transcription PCR—Total RNA was extracted from T47D cells using the TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Quantification and estimation of purity were performed by measuring the absorbance of each RNA sample at UV wavelengths of 260 and 280 nm. Reverse transcription was performed using the SuperscriptII RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR Was Performed Using Specific Primers—MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP7, MMP9, MMP10, and MMP13 sense and anti-sense primers were synthesized as referred in literature (33Monvoisin A. Bisson C. Si-Tayeb K.

TACE primers used were: TACE-F, GCAC CAGG TAAT AGCA GTGA GT; TACE-R, CTCA GCAT TTCG ACGT TACT G. Construction, Production, and Purification of Soluble Forms of Nectin-4 —Human Nectin-4 ectodomains made up with either the V-C-C or the V Ig-like domains were fused to the Fc fragment of the human IgG1. Construction and production of these two soluble forms (named N4VCC-Fc and N4V-Fc, respectively) are already described (31Fabre S. Reymond N. Cocchi F. Menotti L. Dubreuil P. Campadelli-Fiume G. Lopez M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27006-27013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Antibodies—The M2 anti-FLAG mAb was purchased from Sigma. Rabbit anti-TACE pAb was purchased from Chemicon International. The anti-Nectin-4 mAbs were obtained after successive intraperitoneal injections of BALB/c mice with 20 μg of N4VCC-Fc (31Fabre S.

Two hundred clones were tested for differential reactivity to COS cells and COS cells transiently expressing the human Nectin-4. mAbs were then assayed for the ability to detect cell surface expression of Nectin-4 by fluorescence-activated cell sorter and to react with recombinant soluble N4VCC-Fc and N4V-Fc by ELISA. Two clones were obtained. The N4.61 clone reacts with both soluble Nectin-4 forms and is specific to the V domain. The N4.40 clone reacts only with the VCC form and is specific to one of the two C domains (31Fabre S. Reymond N. Cocchi F. Menotti L. Dubreuil P. Campadelli-Fiume G. Lopez M. J. Biol.

ELISA—A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect soluble Nectin-4 in cell culture supernatants and in patient sera. Ninety-six-well trays were coated with 10 μg/ml of either anti-Nectin-4 mAb N4.40 or a purified polyclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal sequence of Nectin-4 (TGNGIYINGRGHLV, N4-pAb) (5Reymond N.

After saturation of wells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 100 μl of supernatant or serum was incubated for 12h at 4 °C, then with 2.5 μg/ml biotinylated mAb N4.61 for 2h at 37 °C. Streptavidin-peroxidase in PBS-bovine serum albumin (2 μg/ml) was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. One hundred μl of peroxidase substrate was added (One Step ABTS, Pierce), and optical density was read at 405 nm. 3–5 Wash Steps Were Performed between Each Incubation with PBS Containing 0.5% Tween 20 —We analyzed duplicates and reported the medium value. Sensitivity of the test is 30 pm, and measurement is linear up to 10-9 m. Nectin-4 concentration was calculated using serial dilutions of N4VCC-Fc (concentrations ranging from 10-9 to 10-12 m). This ELISA does not detect soluble forms of Nectin-1, -2, -3 and PVR-Fc used at the same concentrations. Shedding Assay—CHO or T47D cells were grown on CHO-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% SVF. CHO or T47D cells were seeded on 24-well tissue culture plates and grown to 80–90% of confluence. At the time of treatment, cells were washed once in PBS and grown on serum-free CHO medium in the absence or in the presence of PMA (100 ng/ml) and GM6001 (10 or 25 μm). Supernatants was collected after 1, 3, or 8 h of incubation and filtered before analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Determination of the molecular weight of truncated Nectin-4 on supernatant was determined by immunoblot assay. Cells in 100-mm dishes were washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS and then resuspended for 30 min in 750 μlofice cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol. A protease inhibitor mixture was added as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics). Breast tumor sample lysis was performed for 30 min at +4 °C in a 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, lysis buffer I containing 0.3% SDS and 0.2 m dithiothreitol. Lysates were then treated for 15 min at +4 °C in a 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, lysis buffer II containing 50 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml DNase, and 0.25 mg/ml RNase. Solubilized material was clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. When mentioned, conditioned supernatant or cell lysate were incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml concentrations of the appropriate antibody and then for 1 h at 4 °C with 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immune complexes were washed 3 times with cold lysis buffer, heated in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 3% SDS, 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol), separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, semidry-transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Boston, MA), probed with the indicated antibody, and visualized with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Protein chip arrays (PS-20) from Ciphergen Biosystems (Fremont, CA) were coated with IgG1 irrelevant antibody or anti-Nectin-4 N4.61 antibody (1 μg/ml) as recommended by the manufacturer. Serum or supernatant was adsorbed three times on the chip. After binding and washing, 0.8 μl of a saturated matrix solution (sinapinic acid in 50% acetonitrile and 0.5% trifluoroacetic) was applied to each spot twice. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed using the surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight system PBS-IIc (Ciphergen Biosystems). Spectra were collected by the accumulation of 260 laser shots with a laser intensity of 205 and a detector sensitivity of 10. The protein masses were calibrated externally using purified protein standards. Cell Surface Biotinylation and Time-chase Experiments—For time-chase analysis of the release of Nectin-4 in parallel to cell expression, MDAMB-231 Nectin-4-transfected cells were washed extensively with pH 8 PBS solution and resuspended at 25 × 106/ml, and 500 μg of biotin (Pierce) were added. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, cells were washed with cold pH 8 PBS solution and plated in 60-mm dishes in fresh medium supplemented with PMA (100 ng/ml). Supernatant and cell lysates were prepared over 72 h. Supernatant and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with N4.61 antibody. Precipitates were run on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a streptavidin-coupled peroxidase to detect biotinylated Nectin-4. Supernatant and cell lysates were also analyzed by ELISA. RNA Interference Analysis—CHO-N4 cells were seeded on 24-well tissue culture plates and grown to 50–70% of confluence. Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of siRNA couples specific for TACE or Nectin-2 and Lano (used as an irrelevant control) using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Sequences of siRNA duplexes used were: TACE 1,r(GUUU GCUU GGCA CACC UUU)dTT; TACE 2, r(CAUA GAGC CACU UUGG AGA)dTT; Nectin-2, r(AGUG GAGC AUGA GAGC UUC)dTT; Lano, r(UACC ACCU UCGU CUGC ACA)dTT. Targeted gene silencing efficiency was estimated by Western blot analysis. Twenty μg of cell lysate prepared from a 3-day transfection culture was analyzed using an anti-TACE polyclonal antibody (Chemicon International). To induce cell surface cleavage of Nectin-4, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml PMA for 24 h 2 days after siRNA transfection. Culture supernatants were then harvested at day 3, and Nectin-4 activity was determined by ELISA as previously described (31Fabre S. Reymond N. Cocchi F. Menotti L. Dubreuil P. Campadelli-Fiume G. Lopez M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27006-27013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Soluble Forms of Nectin-4 Detected in Supernatants and in Patient Sera Present Similar Characteristics—Soluble Nectin-4 can be detected both in the supernatant of breast tumor cell lines and in 51% of the sera of patients with metastatic breast carcinoma. Soluble Nectin-4 is never detected in normal sera.1 Different mechanisms may account for Nectin-4 release in supernatant such as cell degradation, proteolytic process, or alternative splicing. Cell degradation seems unlikely as cellular viability was greater than 98% during the experiments for all the cell lines tested. Nectin-4 has three Ig-like domains of V, C, and C type in its extracellular region. We previously described two splice isoforms of Nectin-4 differing by the presence or the absence of a sequence of 25 amino acids at position Gln-411 in the cytoplasmic region (5Reymond N. Fabre S. Lecocq E. Adelaide J. Dubreuil P. Lopez M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43205-43215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We failed to detect other splice variant by reverse transcription-PCR or in the GenBank™ and EST databases, suggesting that a soluble Nectin-4 sequence resulting from alternative splicing probably does not exist. To analyze the mechanism that lead to the generation of soluble Nectin-4, we used in vitro models of cells expressing Nectin-4. To control that these models could faithfully reproduce in vivo processes, we tried to compare the soluble form of Nectin-4 found in the sera and in the supernatants. Two approaches were selected; one is based on their immunological characteristics, and the other is based on their biochemical properties. Epitope mapping of Nectin-4 was performed by ELISA (31Fabre S. Reymond N. Cocchi F. Menotti L. Dubreuil P. Campadelli-Fiume G. Lopez M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27006-27013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) using antibodies specific of the IgV (N4.61), the IgC (N4.40), or the cytoplasmic region of Nectin-4 (anti-Cter). Two different ELISA were developed; an anti-IgC/anti-IgV sandwich (expected to identify both soluble and transmembrane forms of Nectin-4 (EC+TM)) and an anti-Cter/anti-IgV sandwich (expected to detect specifically the transmembrane form of Nectin-4 (TM)). The CHO cell line transfected with the cDNA encoding a Nter tagged full-length transmembrane form of Nectin-4 (CHO-N4) was used as control. Both ELISA readily detected Nectin-4 from CHO-N4 lysates, pointing out that the form detected corresponds to the transmembrane form of Nectin-4 (Fig. 1). The slight difference between the levels of detection may suggest that anti-IgC/anti-IgV ELISA detected a Nectin-4 form undetected by the anti-Cter/anti-IgV ELISA or that the ELISA had a different sensitivity. The Nectin-4 soluble form in the supernatant was detected by the anti-IgC/anti-IgV ELISA and not by the anti-Cter/anti-IgV ELISA. The analysis of the circulating form of Nectin-4 in the sera of two patients with metastatic breast carcinoma indicates that this form is only detected by the anti-IgC/anti-IgV ELISA and not by the anti-Cter/anti-IgV ELISA (Fig. 1). Together these results show that the circulating form of Nectin-4 found in the sera of patients with metastatic breast carcinoma is similar to that detected in vitro in the supernatant. These results suggest that the soluble form produced in the supernatant of CHO-N4 cells may result from cell surface cleavage. Because anti-Nectin-4 mAbs failed to detect serum Nectin-4 by Western blot, serum Nectin-4 molecular mass was analyzed by mass spectrometry and compared with soluble Nectin-4 produced in culture. To this end the anti-Nectin-4 N4.61 mAb was covalently bound to a preactivated surface protein chip array (see “Experimental Procedures”). After incubating the protein chip with the different biological fluids, mass of retained proteins was determined via time of flight mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 2 (black arrow), we detected a protein at 38.5 kDa in the supernatant of CHO-N4. Peak height decreased when supernatant was partially depleted from soluble Nectin-4 before analysis (data not shown). This peak was absent in the control CHO medium. Interestingly, a peak at 35.1 kDa was reproducibly found in the serum of a patient with a breast tumor and not in normal serum (white arrow). This peak was not detected when the protein chip was coated with control IgG1. The difference in molecular mass can be attributable to the FLAG epitope (2.8 kDa) present at the N terminus of the soluble form of Nectin-4 produced in the supernatant. ELISA and mass spectrometry experiments do not demonstrate that the in vitro and in vivo soluble forms of Nectin-4 are strictly"
https://openalex.org/W1974999008,"Female mosquitoes are effective disease vectors, because they take blood from vertebrate hosts to obtain nutrients for egg development. Amino acid signaling via the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway has been identified as a key requirement for the activation of egg development after a blood meal. We report the characterization of the TOR kinase and one of its major downstream targets, S6 kinase, of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti during egg development in adult females. Both TOR and S6K mRNA are expressed at high levels in the ovaries and in lower levels in fat body and other tissues. After a blood meal, the subcellular localization of TOR shifts from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane of fat body cells. By detecting phosphothreonine 388 of mosquito S6 kinase, we show that TOR activity strongly increases in fat body and ovaries after a blood meal in vivo. Furthermore, phosphorylation of S6 kinase increases in in vitro cultured fat bodies after stimulation with amino acids. This increase is sensitive to the TOR inhibitor rapamycin in a concentration-dependent manner but not to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase inhibitor LY294002, the MAPK inhibitor PD98059, or the translational inhibitor cycloheximide. RNA interference-mediated reduction of S6 kinase strongly inhibits the amino acid-induced up-regulation of the major yolk protein vitellogenin in vitro and effectively disrupts egg development after a blood meal in vivo. Our data show that TOR-dependent activation of S6 kinase is a central step in the transduction of nutritional information during egg development in mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W1996226319,"Selenocysteine (Sec) and pyrrolysine (Pyl) are known as the 21st and 22nd amino acids in protein. Both are encoded by codons that normally function as stop signals. Sec specification by UGA codons requires the presence of a cis-acting selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element. Similarly, it is thought that Pyl is inserted by UAG codons with the help of a putative pyrrolysine insertion sequence (PYLIS) element. Herein, we analyzed the occurrence of Pyl-utilizing organisms, Pyl-associated genes, and Pyl-containing proteins. The Pyl trait is restricted to several microbes, and only one organism has both Pyl and Sec. We found that methanogenic archaea that utilize Pyl have few genes that contain in-frame UAG codons, and many of these are followed with nearby UAA or UGA codons. In addition, unambiguous UAG stop signals could not be identified. This bias was not observed in Sec-utilizing organisms and non-Pyl-utilizing archaea, as well as with other stop codons. These observations as well as analyses of the coding potential of UAG codons, overlapping genes, and release factor sequences suggest that UAG is not a typical stop signal in Pyl-utilizing archaea. On the other hand, searches for conserved Pyl-containing proteins revealed only four protein families, including methylamine methyltransferases and transposases. Only methylamine methyltransferases matched the Pyl trait and had conserved Pyl, suggesting that this amino acid is used primarily by these enzymes. These findings are best explained by a model wherein UAG codons may have ambiguous meaning and Pyl insertion can effectively compete with translation termination for UAG codons obviating the need for a specific PYLIS structure. Thus, Sec and Pyl follow dissimilar decoding and evolutionary strategies. Selenocysteine (Sec) and pyrrolysine (Pyl) are known as the 21st and 22nd amino acids in protein.

Methylamine methyltransferase genes from these organisms contain in-frame UAG codons, which do not halt translation, but encode Pyl. Following this discovery, additional Pyl-containing methyltransferases have been identified in Methanosarcina, and to date three classes of Pyl-containing methylamine methyltransferase genes are known: mtmB, dimethylamine methyltransferase (mtbB), and trimethylamine methyltransferase (mttB) (1Hao B. Gong W. Ferguson T.K. James C.M. Krzycki J.A. Chan M.K. Science. 2002; 296: 1462-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 2Srinivasan G. James C.M. Krzycki J.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Some Methanosarcina contain several paralogs of each methyltransferase family. Using this information, various genome sequences were scanned for genes encoding homologous Pyl-containing proteins. This search identified an mttB homolog in a Gram-positive bacterium Desulfitobacterium hafniense (2Srinivasan G. James C.M. Krzycki J.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). More recently, an Antarctic archaeon, Methanococcoides burtoni, has also been reported to utilize Pyl (4Goodchild A. Saunders N.F. Ertan H. Raftery M. Guilhaus M. Curmi P.M. Cavicchioli R. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast, no Pyl-containing methyltransferases have been reported in eukaryotes. It is also not known whether the utilization of Pyl is restricted to methyltransferases or other Pyl-containing proteins exist. Although the mechanism of Pyl biosynthesis and incorporation into protein is not fully understood, the presence of a Methanosarcina tRNApyl gene (pylT) with the CUA anticodon and of class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase gene (pylS) argued for cotranslational incorporation of Pyl (2Srinivasan G. James C.M. Krzycki J.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). A recent study suggested that pylT and pylS are the only foreign genes necessary for translating UAG as Pyl in Escherichia coli, when the cells are supplemented with exogenous Pyl (5Blight S.K. Larue R.C. Mahapatra A. Longstaff D.G. Chang E. Zhao G. Kang P.T. Green-Church K.B. Chan M.K. Krzycki J.A. Nature. 2004; 431: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition, it was reported that PylS could activate and ligate Pyl directly onto tRNApyl (5Blight S.K. Larue R.C. Mahapatra A. Longstaff D.G. Chang E. Zhao G. Kang P.T. Green-Church K.B. Chan M.K.

Sci. 2004; 101: 12450-12454Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and that tRNApyl is directly recognized by the standard elongation factor EF-Tu (7Théobald-Dietrich A. Frugier M. Giegé R. Rudinger-Thirion J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Analysis of the genomic context of pylT and pylS identified pylB, pylC, and pylD, which were suggested to participate in Pyl biosynthesis or insertion into protein (2Srinivasan G. James C.M. Krzycki J.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). pylT, -S, -B, -C, and -D genes constitute a Pyl gene cluster (or Pyl operon), and pylT and pylS genes are considered as the Pyl utilization signature. Because Pyl is inserted in response to a codon that in most organisms functions as a terminator, there are three distinct possibilities for how Pyl insertion can be achieved: (i) redefinition of a subset of UAG stop codons by a cis-acting mRNA signal to encode Pyl; (ii) reassignment of all UAG codons to encode Pyl; and (iii) ambiguous meaning of UAG codons, e.g. a competition between read-through and termination such that a fraction of ribosomes translating the UAG codon incorporate Pyl, whereas the rest support termination (8Atkins J.F. Gesteland R. Science. 2002; 296: 1409-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the attention of researchers has previously focused on the first possibility, because of the analogy between Pyl and selenocysteine (Sec) (9Namy O. Rousset J.P. Napthine S. Brierley I. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 157-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Both Pyl and Sec are encoded by “termination” codons and are the only known additions to the pool of 20 universal, directly encoded, amino acids. Therefore, Sec and Pyl are known as the 21st and 22nd amino acids. The mechanism of Sec insertion is known in much detail (10Böck A. Forchhammer K. Heider J. Leinfelder W. Sawers G. Veprek B.

Incorporation of Sec requires the presence of selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element, a hairpin structure residing in 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of selenoprotein mRNAs in eukaryota and archaea, or immediately downstream of Sec UGA codons in eubacteria (13Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3565-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 14Böck A. Forchhammer K. Heider J. Baron C. Trends Biochem.

SECIS is essential for Sec insertion, whereas in its absence UGA serves as terminator (16Fourmy D. Guittet E. Yoshizawa S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Several attempts have been made to search for analogous stem-loop structures in mRNAs encoding Pyl-containing proteins. A putative secondary structure was predicted 5–6 nucleotides downstream of the Pyl-encoding UAG codon in mtmB mRNAs and designated as pyrrolysine insertion sequence (PYLIS) element (9Namy O. Rousset J.P. Napthine S. Brierley I. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 157-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 17Ibba M. Söll D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This predicted structure has not been tested experimentally for functional relevance. Identification of genes encoding Sec- and Pyl-containing proteins in genomic sequences is challenging, because standard annotation tools interpret UGA and UAG as stop signals. For example, most methylamine methyltransferases in Methanosarcina are incorrectly annotated. At present, no tools are available for prediction of Pyl-containing proteins, and previous in silico approaches were limited to manual analyses and BLAST searches (2Srinivasan G. James C.M. Krzycki J.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In the case of Sec, tools have been developed and successfully used to identify selenoprotein genes by searching for SECIS elements (18Kryukov G.V. Kryukov V.M. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol.

In this study, we used bioinformatics approaches to analyze Pyl-utilizing organisms and Pyl-containing proteins, and to examine possible mechanisms of Pyl insertion. Our data suggest that indiscriminate Pyl insertion at UAG may be tolerated in Pyl-utilizing archaea and that Pyl decoding processes are different from those of Sec. Sequence Databases and Resources—260 completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes were downloaded from the NCBI ftp server (ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria). To analyze incompletely sequenced genomes, we used partial genomic sequences (contigs) from the NCBI data base of microbial genomes as well as a non-redundant nucleotide data base. Both web-based and local Blast programs (23Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar) were used for sequence analysis (available at ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast and www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Identification of Pyl Gene Cluster Homologs and Known Pyl-containing Proteins—pylT and pylS sequences from M. barkeri (accession number AY064401) were used as queries to search genomic databases for possible homologs with an e value below 0.01. Candidate tRNAPyl sequences were further analyzed to identify structural features associated with known tRNAPyl, such as a 6-bp acceptor stem and a base between the D and acceptor stems (2Srinivasan G. James C.M. Krzycki J.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Other genes in the Pyl gene cluster (pylB, -C, and -D) were similarly analyzed by comparative sequence analyses. We further examined whether these genes were organized in clusters. A tblastn program with default parameters was used to search for Pyl-containing methylamine methyltransferases in different organisms. Open reading frames (ORFs) and conservation of UAG-flanking regions were then examined manually. Multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees were generated with ClustalW (24Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar). Analysis of Candidate PYLIS Elements in Methylamine Methyltransferase Genes—Sequences either downstream of in-frame UAG codons or in the putative 3′-UTR of methylamine methyltransferase gene mRNAs were analyzed manually to search for possible conserved structures and sequence features within these structures. RNA secondary structures were predicted with RNAfold 1.4, which is a part of the Vienna RNA package (available at www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/(25Hofacker I.L. Fontana W. Stadler P.F. Bonhoeffer S.M. Schuster P. Monatsh. Chem. 1994; 125: 167-188Crossref Scopus (1760) Google Scholar)). Analyses of UAG Codon Function—To characterize functions of UAG codons, a homology-based approach was developed and used to analyze UAG-flanking regions in four Pyl-utilizing organisms, M. acetivorans, M. mazei, M. burtonii, and D. hafniense. This procedure was implemented using simple Perl scripts (available upon request). First, genes terminating with UAG were extracted from the original annotation files and extended until the next non-UAG stop signal (UAA/UGA). ORFs translated from the elongated genes were analyzed by tblastn against non-redundant and microbial genome databases. We also screened for conservation of UAG codons in nucleotide sequences and of UAG-flanking regions in protein sequences. This procedure assigned each UAG codon to one of three categories as follows: (i) A UAG was interpreted as a terminator if an elongated sequence was sufficiently long (>30 nucleotides), and all of its homologs had a true stop signal (either a non-UAG terminator in Pyl-utilizing organisms or any termination signal in other organisms) that corresponded to the UAG codon. (ii) A UAG was interpreted as a candidate Pyl codon if an elongation was >30 nt, and >50% homologs extended beyond the UAG and terminated near the termination site of the elongated sequence. All identified sequences were then analyzed for conservation of UAG in Pyl-utilizing organisms with blastn and blastp. (iii) A UAG was not assigned a function if the two situations discussed above could not be satisfied (for example, if we observed short elongations beyond UAG codons, lack of sequence similarity between homologs in regions flanking UAG, or a small number of homologs extending beyond the UAG). A non-Pyl-utilizing archaeon, Methanococcus jannaschii, was also analyzed using the same approach. It served as the control in searches involving Pyl-utilizing archaea. Analysis of Overlaps between Elongated UAG-containing Genes and Downstream Genes—Overlaps between genes are common in prokaryotic genomes (26Fukuda Y. Nakayama Y. Tomita M. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 323: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To examine how extensions of UAG-containing genes relate to the extent of the overlap, we analyzed overlapping genes before and after sequence elongation downstream of predicted stop codons in M. acetivorans and M. mazei. A simple Perl script was developed for this analysis (available upon request). We first identified overlapping genes in the original genome annotations, determined the number of overlaps in each genome, and measured overlap lengths. The longest overlap in a genome was defined as an overlap threshold. We then extended genes terminated at UAG until the next non-UAG stop signal using the approach described above and repeated the overlap analysis procedure. We reasoned that if no significant increase in the number of genes whose overlap was longer than the threshold would be observed, the situation would be consistent with the use of UAG as either a terminator or a Pyl codon. However, if the sequence extension procedure generated many genes with large overlaps with the downstream genes, the situation would be consistent with the use of UAG codon as terminator. In addition, the gene overlaps involving genes terminated at UAA and UGA codons were analyzed using the same strategy (e.g. before and after extension). These served as controls. Identification of Genes Associated with Pyl Utilization—All predicted ORFs in M. acetivorans and M. mazei genomes were searched for exclusive occurrence in genomes that utilize Pyl. The tblastn program was used to search these sequences against 260 completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes, non-redundant nucleotide data base and unfinished microbial contigs with an e value below 0.05. A simple script was developed to parse the tblastn output and examine presence/absence of homologs in analyzed genomes. A pairwise alignment tool, bl2seq, was then used with an e value cutoff set to 0.001 to cluster protein sequences into different families. The occurrence of these proteins in D. hafniense was then analyzed. Available completely and incompletely sequenced prokaryotic genomes were screened for tRNApyl (pylT) and pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (pylS) sequences, and their patterns of occurrence were compared with those of other Pyl genes (pylB, -C, and -D). We found that the products of pylB (biotin synthase homolog) and pylC (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase homolog) have close homologs in a wide variety of organisms. In contrast, pylS, pylT, and pylD (nucleoside-diphosphate sugar epimerase homolog) are specific for methanogenic archaea and D. hafniense (Fig. 1). In D. hafniense, pylSn and pylSc encode the N- and C-terminal parts of PylS (2Srinivasan G. James C.M. Krzycki J.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), and small overlaps occur between pylT and pylSc (4 nt) and between the pylB and pylC genes (52 nt). pylS, pylT, and pylD always cluster with pylB and pylC, and the overall Pyl gene cluster has identical mutual organization of these sequences, except that D. hafniense pylSn is located at the end of the cluster (Fig. 1). Thus, the five Pyl genes define the Pyl gene cluster, but only pylT and pylS (and perhaps pylD) sequences can be used as the signature for the Pyl trait. A search of completely and incompletely sequenced prokaryotic genomes for Pyl genes revealed only six organisms that could utilize Pyl, including four members of Methanosarcina genera, M. burtonii, and D. hafniense. Methanosarcina species and M. burtonii belong to Methanosarcinales, suggesting that Pyl is encoded by a UAG codon in a restricted group of phylogenetically related organisms that occupy a specific environmental niche. High conservation of the Pyl gene cluster and the small number of organisms that utilize Pyl suggest its relatively recent origin. In the 6 Pyl-utilizing organisms, a total of 29 Pyl-containing methylamine methyltransferase genes was identified (Table I). They are distributed in three enzyme families that do not share significant sequence similarity. Fig. 2 shows the occurrence of these genes in genomes and contigs. Only mtmB genes cluster with the Pyl operon genes (in three Methanosarcina organisms). In M. mazei, two distant duplicate mtmB genes are present. In M. barkeri, two duplicate mtmB1 genes cluster together and are on the opposite strands with the Pyl cluster.Table IDistribution of Pyl-containing methylamine methyltransferase genes in Pyl-utilizing organismsDomain of lifeOrganismMMA methyltransferase (mtmB)DMA methyltransferase (mtbB)TMA methyltransferase (mttB)ArchaeaM. acetivoransmtmB1, mtmB2mtbB1, mtbB2, mtbB3mttB1, mttB2M. barkerimtmB1 (2Srinivasan G.

On the other hand, multiple MttB homologs were detected, in which Pyl is not conserved and replaced with various amino acids (Fig. 3). This situation is in contrast to Sec, which is highly conserved. In addition, most selenoproteins have homologs, in which Sec is replaced with cysteine (Cys). In fact, the Sec/Cys pair in homologous sequences is a feature that is used for identification of selenoproteins in genomic databases (21Kryukov G.V. Gladyshev V.N. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 22Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Kryukov G.V. Lescure A. Blanco E. Krol A. Gladyshev V.N. Guigó R. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analyses of the three methylamine methyltransferase families as well as of the pylT and pylS genes typically placed D. hafniense genes as outliers (Fig. 4). In Pyl-utilizing archaea, all mtmB, mtbB, and mttB genes encode Pyl-containing proteins. Conversely, D. hafniense possessed mttB genes encoding proteins with and without Pyl. MttB homologs that did not have Pyl were broadly distributed in other bacteria. Although the use of Pyl appears to be prevalent in methanogenic archaea, from our data it could not be established with certainty whether the Pyl trait evolved in these organisms or in bacteria. Both Pyl operon sequences and mttB have optimal codon usage in organisms in which they are present (data not shown), arguing against a recent (traceable) lateral transfer of the Pyl trait between methanogenic archaea and D. hafniense. By analogy to SECIS, a stem-loop structure in selenoprotein mRNAs that reprograms a small fraction of UGA codons in a genome to serve in Sec insertion (11Low S.C. Berry M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 13Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3565-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), the occurrence of putative PYLIS structures was proposed (9Namy O. Rousset J.P. Napthine S. Brierley I. Mol.

However, we found that the RNA structures downstream of UAG codons in several mtbB and mttB mRNAs that were recently suggested as putative PYLIS elements (17Ibba M. Söll D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) are dissimilar and do not occur in mtmB. Manual analyses of sequences downstream of UAG codons, as well as sequences in UTRs revealed no obvious common structure shared by members of all three methylamine methyltransferase families. A possibility remains that structures downstream of UAG codons inhibit termination. Because UGA has a dual function in Sec-utilizing organisms (Sec insertion and translation termination), there is a possibility that UAG, in a similar fashion, also serves two functions (Pyl insertion and translation termination) in Pyl-utilizing organisms. If PYLIS is absent, what might be a mechanism for discriminating between the two functions of UAG codons? An alternative possibility would be a reassignment of all UAG codons from stop to Pyl. To address these possibilities, we analyzed the distribution of the three stop codons in Pyl-utilizing organisms (Table II). In D. hafniense, the percentage of the genes predicted to terminate at UAG is 22.5%, which is similar to the proportion of genes predicted to terminate at UGA (28.4%). The extensive utilization of UAG in this bacterium suggests that this codon likely has a dual role in protein synthesis.Table IIDistribution of annotated UAA, UAG, and UGA codons in the genomes of Pyl-utilizing organismsOrganismGenome size (nt)Annotated genesStop codonUAGUAAUGAArchaeaM. acetivorans5,751,4924,540224 (4.9%)2,217 (48.8%)2,099 (46.3%)M. mazei4,096,3453,371126 (3.7%)1,800 (53.4%)1,445 (42.9%)M. burtonii∼2.6 m (unfinished)2,782131 (4.7%)1,264 (45.4%)1,383 (49.9%)BacteriumD. hafniense∼6.1 m (unfinished)4,9991127 (22.5%)2,427 (48.5%)1,422 (28.4%) Open table in a new tab In contrast, the proportion of genes that are predicted to terminate at UAG in Pyl-containing archaea is <5.0%. For example, only 126 (including all incorrectly annotated methylamine methyltransferases) of 3,371 genes are predicted to use UAG terminator in M. mazei. This value is much lower than the proportion of UAA or UGA terminators, suggesting that UAG might be functionally distinct from UAA and UGA in these archaea. We further used a homology-based search strategy to examine the coding potential of UAG codons as an additional test to characterize the function of these codons in archaea. Our approach was to extend the reading frames of all genes predicted to contain UAG codons until the next non-UAG stop signal. For each elongated UAG-containing gene, the tblastn program was used to identify candidate homologs in other organisms and to examine the conservation of UAG-flanking regions within translated sequences. We reasoned that if a sequence is sufficiently extended (>30 nt) beyond the UAG, and all of its homologs in other organisms have true stop signals that corresponded to the UAG codon (that is, only the sequence upstream of UAG is conserved, whereas sequence similarity is absent downstream of UAG), the UAG should be a terminator (Fig. 5A). Using this strategy, we could reliably identify UGA stop signals in Sec-utilizing organisms and distinguish them from UGA codons for Sec (data not shown). Conversely, if the extension is long (>30 nt), and most candidate homologs extend beyond the UAG to end near (or after) the site corresponding to the non-UAG stop codon in the elongated sequence, the UAG codon in the sequence of interest is considered a Pyl codon candidate. In addition to testing UAG function, this strategy could also be used for identification, in Pyl-encoding organisms, of candidate Pyl-containing proteins. To avoid the possibility of dealing with a sequencing error or a pseudogene, we required the presence of sequences encoding a candidate Pyl-containing protein in two or more genomes of Pyl-utilizing organisms (Fig. 5B). In this case, methylamine methyltransferases served as true positives, because they can be extended beyond their Pyl UAG codons, share homology with other proteins in sequences downstream of their UAG codons, and occur in at least 4 Pyl-utilizing organisms as Pyl-containing forms (Fig. 3). In other situations (see Fig. 5C for specific examples), we could not distinguish between Pyl-encoding functions and stop signals. However, if the UAG was followed with a nearby stop codon, either Pyl insertion or translation termination could presumably be tolerated. Surprisingly"
https://openalex.org/W2093114816,"The Raf-MEK-ERK protein kinase cascade is a highly conserved signaling pathway that is pivotal in relaying environmental cues from the cell surface to the nucleus. Three Raf isoforms, which share great sequence and structure similarities, have been identified in mammalian cells. We have previously identified Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) as a negative regulator of the Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway by specifically binding to the Raf-1 isoform. We show here that RKIP also antagonizes kinase activity of the B-Raf isoform. Yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that RKIP specifically interacted with B-Raf. Ectopic expression of RKIP antagonized the kinase activity of B-Raf. We showed that the effects of RKIP on B-Raf functions were independent of its known inhibitory action on Raf-1. The expression levels of RKIP in melanoma cancer cell lines are low relative to primary melanocytes. Forced expression of RKIP partially reverted the oncogenic B-Raf kinase-transformed melanoma cancer cell line SK-Mel-28. The low expression of RKIP and its antagonistic action on B-Raf suggests that RKIP may play an important role in melanoma turmorgenesis."

By contrast, macrophage production of 1,25-(OH)2D is often dysregulated with potential hypercalcemic complications. We have postulated that this is due to abnormal catabolism of 1,25-(OH)2D by the feedback control enzyme, vitamin D-24-hydroxylase (CYP24). Using chick HD-11 and human THP-1 myelomonocytic cell lines, we have shown that macrophage-like cells express a splice variant of the CYP24 gene (CYP24-SV), which encodes a truncated protein. Compared with the holo-CYP24 gene product in chick and human cells (508 and 513 amino acids, respectively), the truncated CYP24-SV versions consisted of 351 and 372 amino acids. These CYP24-SV proteins retained intact substrate-binding domains but lacked mitochondrial targeting sequences and were therefore catalytically inactive. In common with CYP24, expression of the CYP24 variants was induced by 1,25-(OH)2D but without a concomitant rise in 24-hydroxylase activity. However, overexpression of CYP24-SV in HD-11 and THP-1 cells reduced synthesis of 1,25-(OH)2 D (40–50%), whereas antisense CYP24-SV expression increased 1,25-(OH)2D production by 2–7-fold. These data suggest that alternative splicing of CYP24 leads to the generation of a dominant negative-acting protein that is catalytically dysfunctional.

Thus, the 24-OHase plays an important role in attenuating the potentially detrimental hypercalcemic side effects of vitamin D by catalyzing the catabolism of active 1,25-(OH)2D to less active downstream metabolites and by competing with 1α-OHase for their common substrate, 25-OHD (8Reddy G.S.

At these sites, 1α-OHase has been postulated to act in an autocrine or paracrine fashion by increasing local concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D in a tissue-specific manner. Whereas kidney-synthesized 1,25-(OH)2D functions to systemically regulate serum calcium and phosphorous levels for bone homeostasis (2Zehnder D. Hewison M. Mol. Cell.

By contrast, the abundant extrarenal production of 1,25-(OH)2D by cells such as activated macrophages is characterized by 1) unresponsiveness to stimulation by parathyroid hormone (21Adams J.S.

Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2567-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); 2) lack of feedback inhibition of 1α-OHase by 1,25-(OH)2D itself (22Adams J.S. Gacad M.A. J. Exp.

Metab. 1997; 82: 2222-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The latter mechanism appears to be particularly important in macrophages, because CYP24 gene expression is readily stimulated by 1,25-(OH)2Din these cells without any apparent induction of catabolic 24-OHase enzyme activity (25Monkawa T. Yoshida T. Hayashi M. Saruta T. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 559-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To clarify this, we have characterized a novel mechanism for the regulation of 1,25-(OH)2D production in macrophages, which involves alternative splicing of the CYP24 gene and expression of a catalytically inactive, amino-terminally truncated 24-OHase protein. As such, regulated expression of the CYP24 splice variant (CYP24-SV) can rheostatitically control the production of 1,25-(OH)2D in macrophages.

After 24-h treatment, the cells were 80–90% adherent, and the medium containing TPA was replaced with normal culture medium for cell maintenance until experimental reagents were added. In addition to the HD-11 and THP-1 cells, other human cells were used for RT-PCR analysis of CYP24 expression. These included HKC-8 proximal tubules cells (26Bland R. Walker E.A. Hughes S.V.

Multiple sets of PCR primers were synthesized according to the published chick kidney 24-OHase cDNA sequence (CYP24; GenBank™ accession number AF019142), among which the following series of nested PCR primer pairs yielded a predominant PCR product of ∼1.4 kb: 1) forward primer 5′-GCCCTACCTAAAAGCATGTCTGAAGG (1104–1129) and reverse primer 5′-TCTGTCATGCACAGTCCTTCTGCTGC (1819–1794); 2) forward primer 5′-GGAAGGAAAGGACTGGCAGAGG (432–453) and reverse primer 5′-CTCTGCTAAGCGACGGCCAATGC (1389–1367). PCR was carried out using the Advantage cDNA PCR kit (Clontech) applying the following parameters: 94 °C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 12 s and annealing/extension at 68 °C for 3 min with a final extension of 3 min at 68 °C. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose (Invitrogen) gel with a 1-kb Plus DNA Ladder (Invitrogen) as a size marker and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The predicted size-matched bands on the gel were purified by a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and cloned into the PCR4-TOPO plasmid vector and TOP10 competent Escherichia coli cells using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen).

Because of the GC-rich region at the 5′-end of the template, Me2SO (5%; Sigma) was added in the PCR mixture for 5′-RACE reactions. The RACE products were sequenced as described above. PCR and GenomeWalker Analysis of CYP24 Genomic DNA Sequences—To acquire further sequence information for the chick CYP24 gene, genomic DNA was extracted from cultured HD-11 cells by QIAmp Blood Kit (Qiagen). PCR primers were derived from the cDNA sequences determined from RT-PCR and RACE results described above: forward primer, 5′-AGATGCCTCCCTGCACGTGTCGTA (CYP24-SV cDNA 125–148); reverse primer, 5′-CCACAGGTGTCACCATCATCATTCC (CYP24-SV cDNA 516–492). PCR was carried out using the Advantage-GC Genomic PCR Kit (Clontech) with a 1 m GC-Melt concentration and the same cycle parameters described for the RT-PCRs. The 5′-flanking genomic DNA sequence of the chick CYP24 gene was obtained from HD-11 cell genomic DNA using the Universal GenomeWalker Kit (Clontech) and the Advantage-GC Genomic PCR Kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The nested antisense primers arising from the 5′-end of CYP24-SV cDNA were reverse primer “A” 5′-CCAGTTTCACCACCTCCTTGGGTTTCATCAG (CYP24-SV cDNA 270–240) and reverse primer “B” 5′-CTCTGCCAGTCCTTTCCTTCCCTAGGCGTAA (214–184). The products of PCR and GenomeWalker were cloned and sequenced as described above. Cloning and Sequencing of a Human Form of CYP24-SV—Total RNA was extracted from TPA-differentiated THP-1 cells (dTHP-1) in the presence or absence of 200 nm 1,25-(OH)2D (BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA) for 24 h using the TRIzol Reagent (Total RNA Isolation Reagent; Invitrogen). Reverse transcription of mRNA was performed by PowerScript Reverse Transcriptase (Clontech) and tailed primer oligo(dT) (16Lou Y.R. Laaksi I. Syvala H. Blauer M. Tammela T.L. Ylikomi T. Tuohimaa P. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 332-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) to produce cDNA for PCR templates. Multiple sets of PCR primers were synthesized according to the published human 24-OHase cDNA (GenBank™ number L13268) and genomic DNA (GenBank™ number AL138805), among which the following series of bridged PCR primer pairs yielded a predominant PCR product of ∼1.4 kb: 1) forward primer (5′-GCTC TAAATGTATTCCTGCTTCTCTCAC) (AL138805 73837–73864, in intron II) and reverse primer (5′-GCTCTAAATGTATTCCTGCTTCTCTCAC) (L13268 1231–1256, in exons IV and IIV) for the first PCR reaction; 2) forward primer (5′-GGACACCTCAAAATCCCTGAACCCAA) (AL138805: 74092–74117, in intron II) and reverse primer (5′-GCTCTAAATGTATTCCTGCTTCTCTCAC) (L13268: 1231–1256, in exons IV and IIV) for the second PCR; and 3) forward primer (5′-GCTCTAAATGTATTCCTGCTTCTCTCAC) (AL138805 73837–73864, in intron II) and reverse primer (5′-ACTCAGTCCGCTTCCCTGAGTTGGA) (L13268 1994–1970, in exon XII) for the third PCR. PCR conditions and subsequent procedures for PCR products such as purification, cloning, subcloning, and sequencing were the same as those described for cloning of the chick CYP24-SV. RT-PCR Analysis of CYP24-SV mRNA Expression—Expression of mRNA for the alternatively spliced CYP24 gene was evaluated by RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses. Reverse transcription was performed by random primer and PowerScript reverse transcriptase (Clontech). Three pairs of PCR primers were designed according to the unique cDNA sequence of 1) chick CYP24-SV (forward primer, 5′-AGATGCCTCCCTGCACGTGTCGTA (cDNA 125–148); reverse primer, 5′-TGCTGCAGGAGACCAAACCTCTTTC (430–406), spanning 306 bp or with reverse primer 5′-CCTTCAGACATGCTTTTAGGTAGGGCA (891–866), spanning 766 bp); 2) chick kidney CYP24 (forward primer, 5′-ATGGGAGGCTGCAGCATCCTTCTC (cDNA 13–36); reverse primer, 5′-TGCTGCAGGAGACCAAACCTCTTTC (668–644), spanning 655 bp); and 3) chick β-actin (forward primer, 5′-ACCACAGCCGAGAGAGAAAT (cDNA 672–691); reverse primer, 5′-GACAGGGAGGCCAGGATAGA (1117–1098), spanning 445 bp). PCR was performed by Advantage-GC cDNA PCR Kit (Clontech) with a final GC-Melt concentration of 1 m and the same PCR parameters as above, with the β-actin primers as a control for each PCR. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel with a 1-kb Plus DNA Ladder. PCR primers for the human CYP24-SV were designed according to the unique cDNA sequence of 1) hCYP24 (forward primer, 5′-GAGACTGGTGACATCTACGGCGTACA (L13268 468–493, in exon I) and reverse primer 5′-CCATAAAATCGGCCAAGACCTCATTG (L13268 952–927, in exons III and IV), spanning 484 bp); 2) hCYP24-SV (forward primer, 5′-GGACACCTCAAAATCCCTGAACCCAA (AL138805 74092–74117, in intron II); reverse primer, 5′-CCATAAAATCGGCCAAGACCTCATTG (L13268 952–927, in exon III and IV), spanning 396 bp); and 3) human β-actin (forward primer, 5′-AGAGAGGCATCCTCACCCTG (GenBank™ number NM_001101 221–238); reverse primer, 5′-TCACCGGAGTCCATCACGAT (NM_001101 543–524), spanning 288 bp). PCR conditions and electrophoresis procedures were the same as those described for chick CYP24-SV. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from HD-11 cells using the same conditions and methods as described above under “RT-PCR Analysis of mRNA.” Aliquots (50 μg) of total RNA were loaded in each lane and separated by electrophoresis using a 1% agarose (Invitrogen), 2.2 m formaldehyde (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) gels containing ethidium bromide. The resolved RNA was transferred onto nylon membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) in 10× SSC buffer (0.3 m NaCl, 0.03 M sodium citrate, pH 7) for 16 h. The transferred filters were prehybridized with QuikHyb Hybridization Solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at 68 °C for 1 h and then hybridized in the same solution at 68 °C for 12 h to a random primed 32P-labeled 715-bp probe (wild type CYP24 cDNA 1104–1819) sharing the same cDNA sequences between the chick CYP24 and its splice variant. The filters were then washed in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 30 min and exposed to x-ray film at –70 °C overnight. Preparation of Polyclonal Antiserum against Chick CYP24 and CYP24-SV—A custom chick CYP24-SV peptide N′-GKRFGLLQQDVEEES (CYP24-SV amino acids 55–69) sharing the same sequence with that of CYP24 and the custom rabbit polyclonal antiserum against this peptide were prepared and tested with high pressure liquid chromatography and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay by Sigma-Genosys (Woodlands, TX). The antiserum titer determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the peptide-specific antibody was >1:500,000. Western Blot Analysis—HD-11 cells were preincubated with vehicle or 1,25-(OH)2D (200 nm) for 24 h before extracting whole cell or mitochondrial protein. The mitochondrial extraction procedure was the same as previously described (28Shany S. Ren S. Arbelle J.E. Clemens T.L. Adams J.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 82: 69-76Google Scholar). The extracted mitochondrial pellets and the whole cultured cells were washed with PBS at room temperature, and the protein extracts were then prepared by lysis of mitochondria and cells on ice with radioimmune precipitation buffer (PBS, 0.5% sodium deosycholate, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), passing through the 21-gauge needle to shear DNA and other cellular components, and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. A Micro-BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) was used to determine protein concentration. 30 μg of protein from each group was loaded for each lane on the 10% Tris-HCl Precast Gel and separated by the SDS-PAGE system following the protocol recommended by the supplier (Bio-Rad). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), probed with the rabbit polyclonal antiserum for the chick CYP24-SV (1:500 diluted), and visualized by Western Light detection system (Tropix, Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For protein loading and mitochondrial expression positive control, the goat polyclonal IgG against GRP75 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) (1:500 diluted) was also used to probe the Western blot following the same procedure described above. The blots with the same protein loading but probed by the anti-cCYP24-SV and anti-GRP75 were compared. Transfection of CYP24 and CYP24-SV Expression Constructs—Three cDNA expression constructs were prepared for transfection studies by RT-PCR using the primer pairs synthesized according to the sequences of chick CYP24 and its splice variant (CYP24-SV), each containing restriction enzyme excision sites. The sequences for these primer pairs were as follows (the underlines indicate the restriction enzyme excision sites): 1) antisense CYP24-SV construct (located at the 5′-end of CYP24-SV cDNA) (forward primer, 5′-TTTCTCTAGAGATGCTGCGGACT (CYP24-SV cDNA 42–52); reverse primer, 5′-AGGTCTCGAGGCGTAAATAAAAGCAG (189–174); 2) sense CYP24-SV construct (containing full-length open reading frame (ORF) of CYP24-SV) (forward primer, 5′-AGCTCGAGATGAAACCCAAGGAGGTGGTGACAAGGAGGTGGTGA (CYP24-SV cDNA 243–264); reverse primer, 5′-CCCTCTAGAGGCCGTCATTAGTCAAGCTGCA (1306–1285)); 3) antisense CYP24 construct (located at the 5′-end of CYP24 cDNA) (forward primer, 5′-GGTCTAGATATGGGAGGCTGCAGCATCCTTC (CYP24 cDNA 12–34); reverse primer, 5′-GTCTCGAGAGTCCCGATAGGCTTTCCA (400–382)). The resulting PCR products were digested with XbaI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites, run on agarose gels, appropriate bands were excised, and the resulting cDNAs were subcloned into a eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). After cloning and sequence analysis, expression constructs containing the sense and antisense cDNAs for CYP24 and CYP24-SV were transiently transfected into HD-11 cells by lipofection (LipoTAXI; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, HD-11 cells were seeded in wells on 12-well plates 24 h prior to transfection and grown to 80% confluence. 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA and 15 μl of LipoTAXI reagent were added in culture wells with DMEM alone. 5 h later, an equal volume of DMEM containing 20% FBS was added to each well, and another 16 h later the medium above was replaced by normal culture medium. After a 24-h incubation in the normal culture medium, the transfected cells were ready for vitamin D metabolism assessment (see below). For stable tranfection, 5 μg of plasmid DNA and 70 μl of LipoTAXI reagent were added to HD-11 cells in each 60-mm tissue culture dish following the same transfection procedure above. After a 24-h incubation with normal culture medium, tranfected cells were cultured and maintained in DMEM containing 600 μg/ml G418 (Omega, Tarzana, CA). The medium was changed every 3 days. Four weeks after, G418-resistant clones were picked and grown for further experiments. Similar experiments were also carried out using sense and antisense expression constructs for hCYP24-SV. These constructs were produced using the following sets of primers: 1) antisense hCYP24-SV construct (located at the 5′-end of the CYP24-SV cDNA) (forward primer, 5′-AACCTCTAGAGACTAGGAGGAAAGG (hCYP24-SV 61–75, in intron II of hCYP24); reverse primer, 5′-CAAACTCGAGGTGAGAGAAGCAGGA (hCYP24-SV 281–267, in intron II of hCYP24); 2) sense hCYP24-SV construct (containing full-length ORF of hCYP24-SV) (forward primer, 5′-CCCCTCGAGCTCTAAATGTATTCCTGC (hCYP24-SV 255–272); reverse primer, 5′-CCCTCTAGAGCGTATTATCGCTGG (hCYP24-SV 1384–1368). Purification and subcloning procedures were as outlined for chick CYP24-SV. However, for hCYP24-SV, the transfection protocol for THP-1 cells was as follows; THP-1 cells in suspension were centrifuged and briefly washed with DMEM (Gibco), seeded in wells on 12-well plates (5 × 106 cells/well) prior to transfection. Aliquots (2 μg) of plasmid DNA and 10 μl of LipoTAXI reagent were added in culture wells with DMEM alone. 6 h later, an equal volume of completed RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% FBS was added to each well, and another 18 h later, a double volume of completed RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and 240 nm TPA was added, reaching the final concentration of 10% FBS and 160 nm TPA. After a 24-h exposure of TPA, the transiently transfected THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophage-like dTHP-1 cells recognized because 90% of the cells were found to be adhesive, and were ready for vitamin D metabolism assessment (see below). Measurement of 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-(OH)2D) Production—Cultures of HD-11 or dTHP-1 cells were grown in 12-well plates. After washing with FBS-free medium three times, cells were incubated with 200 nm 25-OHD (Sigma), solubilized in absolute ethanol (0.1% final concentration) in 1% FBS culture medium (1 ml/well) for 3 h. Incubation of whole cell preparations with substrate was terminated by the addition of 1 volume of acetonitrile (J. T. Baker Inc.). The conditioned medium and cell monolayers were harvested, vortexed, and centrifuged. Supernatant was transferred into a half-volume of 400 mm KH2PO4 (pH 10.5) for chromatography and 1,25-(OH)2D assay by the 1,25-(OH)2D 125I RIA kit (DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN), following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were also collected without acetonitrile from a separate well for cell counting. Data were then reported as fmol of 1,25-(OH)2D produced/h/106 cells. Cloning and Sequence Analysis of a Splice Variant of the Vitamin D-24-hydroxylase (CYP24-SV) in the Chick Macrophage Cell Line HD-11—Using a series of primers based on the chicken 24-hydroxylase cDNA sequence, we cloned a novel 2.5-kb cDNA variant of CYP24 from chick macrophage HD-11 cells (GenBank™/EBI accession number AF428109). The variant cDNA was 200 bp shorter than the published sequence for chick CYP24; the last 2324 bp showed almost 100% sequence identity to the chick CYP24, whereas the first 193 bp showed less than 40% ident"
https://openalex.org/W1965987801,"The effects of 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME)-induced apoptosis was examined in human leukemia cells (U937 and Jurkat) in relation to mitochondrial injury, oxidative damage and perturbations in signaling pathways. 2ME induced apoptosis in these cells in a dose-dependent manner associated with release of mitochondrial proteins (cytochrome c, AIF), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), downregulation of Mcl-1 and XIAP and inactivation (dephosphorylation) of Akt accompanied by activation of JNK. In these cells, enforced activation of Akt by a constitutively active myristolated Akt construct prevented 2ME-mediated mitochondrial injury, XIAP and Mcl-1 downregulation, JNK activation and apoptosis, but not ROS generation. Conversely, 2ME lethality was potentiated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002. Furthermore, in U937 cells, the hydrogen peroxide scavenger catalase and a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic, TBAP, blocked these events, as well as Akt inactivation. Interruption of the JNK pathway by pharmacologic or genetic (e.g. siRNA) means attenuated 2ME-induced mitochondrial injury, XIAP and Mcl-1 downregulation and apoptosis. Collectively, these findings suggest a hierarchical model of 2ME-related apoptosis induction in human leukemia cells in which 2ME-induced oxidative injury represents a primary event resulting in Akt inactivation, leading, in turn, to JNK activation and culminating in XIAP and Mcl-1 downregulation, mitochondrial injury and apoptosis. They also suggest that in human leukemia cells, the Akt pathway plays a critical role in mediating the response to oxidative stress induced by 2ME."
https://openalex.org/W2009972187,"The tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) regulates the phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway and has been shown to correlate with poor prognosis in high-grade astrocytomas when mutational inactivation or loss of the PTEN gene occurs. PTEN mutation leads to constitutive activation of protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt with phosphorylation at the PKB/Akt sites Thr-308 and Ser-473. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) has been shown to regulate PKB/Akt activity with the loss of PTEN in prostate cancer. We now demonstrate that ILK activity regulates PKB/Akt activity in glioblastoma cells. The activity of ILK is constitutively elevated in a serum-independent manner in PTEN mutant cells, and transfection of wild-type PTEN under the control of an inducible promoter into mutant PTEN cells inhibits ILK activity. Transfection of ILK antisense (ILKAS) or exposure to a small-molecule ILK inhibitor suppresses the constitutive phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser-473 in PTEN-mutant glioblastoma cell lines. In addition, the delivery of ILKAS to PTEN-negative glioblastoma cells resulted in apoptosis. Rag-2M mice bearing established ( approximately 100 mg) human U87MG glioblastoma tumors, treated QD x 5 for 3 consecutive weeks with ILKAS (i.p. 5 mg/kg), exhibited stable disease with < or =7% increase in tumor volume over the 3-week course of treatment. In contrast, animals treated with an oligonucleotide control or saline exhibited a >100% increase in tumor volume over the same time period. Our initial results indicate that therapeutic strategies targeting ILK may be beneficial in the treatment of glioblastomas."
https://openalex.org/W1601996378,"αvβ3 integrin-overexpression in tumor associated vasculature is a marker of poor prognosis in breast cancer. A positive correlation between αvβ3 integrin and overexpression of Heregulin (HRG), a growth factor associated with breast cancer aggressiveness was recently demonstrated. Here, we addressed the role of αvβ3 in the proliferation and survival of HRG-overexpressing breast cancer models. Expression of the RGD-binding integrins αvβ3, αvβ5 and αvβ6 was assessed in the HRG-overexpressing breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231, Hs578T (231/WT and Hs578T/WT, respectively) and derived cells transfected with the antisense orientation of the HRG-β2 full-length cDNA (231/ASPOOL, 231/AS31 and Hs578T/AS15). Interestingly, only αvβ3 expression was noticeably decreased by blockade of HRG expression in the 231/ASPOOL, 231/AS31 and Hs578T/AS15 cells. Small RGD-based peptidomimetic αvβ3 antagonists significantly decreased cell viability and anchorage-dependent cell growth of HRG-overexpressing cells, while the low-HRG-expressing 231/AS31 cells did not show a significant response. Mechanistically, functional blockade of αvβ3 impaired HRG-promoted hyperactivation of ERK1/ERK2 MAPK without altering the activation of AKT. Flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle demonstrated that αvβ3 antagonists significantly decreased S- and G2/M-phase subpopulations of 231/WT and control 231/VEC cells. Comparable, this effect was linked to an increase in the levels and nuclear translocation of the CDKs inhibitor p27Kip1. Besides downregulating αvβ3 and its driven signaling, HRG blockade led to decreased levels of CYR61 in 231/ASPOOL and 231/AS31 cells. Considering that CYR61 is sufficient to upregulate the expression of αvβ3, we then assessed αvβ3 levels in MDA-MB-231 cell derivatives expressing the antisense orientation of the CYR61 cDNA (231/CYR61AS-5 and 231/CYR61AS-8). Remarkably, downregulation of CYR61 drastically decreased the levels of αvβ3 in the 231/CYR61-5 and 231/CYR61-8 cells, providing further evidence of a key role for CYR61 in HRG-dependent αvβ3 overexpression. Moreover, blockade of CYR61 expression impaired the HRG-induced hyperactivation of ERK1/ERK2 MAPK without altering the activation status of AKT in MDA-MB-231 cells, thus resembling the effects exerted by the downregulation of HRG expression as well as by functional blockade of αvβ3. These results indicate that HRG is regulating αvβ3 levels as well as αvβ3-triggered signaling through its downstream effector, CYR61, in highly invasive breast cancer cells. Altogether, the data presented here provide evidence of a CYR61-regulatory role on αvβ3 integrin expression in the modulation of uncontrolled growth of HRG-overexpressing breast carcinomas. This work supports additional studies concerning the use of integrin antagonists as dual therapeutic agents in breast cancer, targeting both, endothelial and tumor cells."

The M2 channel causes acidification of the interior of the virus particle, which results in viral protein-protein dissociation. The M2 protein is a homotetramer that contains in its aqueous pore a histidine residue (His-37) that acts as a selectivity filter and a tryptophan residue (Trp-41) that acts as a channel gate. Substitution of His-37 modifies M2 ion channel properties drastically. However, the results of such experiments are difficult to interpret because substitution of His-37 could cause gross structural changes to the channel pore. We described here experiments in which partial or, in some cases, full rescue of specific M2 ion channel properties of His-37 substitution mutants was achieved by addition of imidazole to the bathing medium. Chemical rescue was demonstrated for three histidine substitution mutant ion channels (M2-H37G, M2-H37S, and M2-H37T) and for two double mutants in which the Trp-41 channel gate was also mutated (H37G/W41Y and H37G/W41A). Currents of the M2-H37G mutant ion channel were inhibited by Cu(II), which has been shown to coordinate with His-37 in the wild-type channel. Chemical rescue was very specific for imidazole. Buffer molecules that were neutral when protonated (4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid and 3-morpholino-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid) did not rescue ion channel activity of the M2-H37G mutant ion channel, but 1-methylimidazole did provide partial rescue of function.

Second, M2 channel activity has also been recorded in artificial lipid bilayers from a reconstituted peptide corresponding to the TM domain of the M2 protein (15Duff K.C. Ashley R.H.

Thus, due to its structural simplicity, the M2 ion channel is a potentially useful model for studying ion channels in general. The ion selectivity of the M2 ion channel has been studied with voltage clamp (18Mould J.A. Drury J.E. Frings S.M. Kaupp U.B. Pekosz A. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. J. Biol.

The channel is inactive for extracellular pH values higher than pH 7.5 but becomes active when extracellular pH is lowered. This greater activity is due to two factors, greater abundance of protons and increased channel opening due to an interaction between protonated His-37 and the indole side chain of Trp-41, the putative “gate” of the ion channel (20Okada A. Miura T. Takeuchi H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6053-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 21Tang Y. Zaitseva F. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. J. Biol.

Experiments in which His-37 of the TM domain was replaced by site-directed mutagenesis with Gly, Ala, Glu, Lys, and Arg (22Wang C. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1363-1371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) indicate that His-37 is essential for the proton selectivity of the channel and its activation by low pH. However, it is possible that substitution of even a single residue in the closely packed pore of this protein might bring about large structural changes in the protein, making a comparison of the mutant and wild-type (wt) channels difficult. For some enzymes that transport protons as part of their catalytic cycle, substitution of histidine in the active site with alanine or glycine resulted in loss of enzymatic activity, e.g. carbonic anhydrase II (23Tu C.K.

However, one way to overcome the argument that the amino acid substitution caused gross structural changes in the protein was achieved by partial or complete chemical rescue of the mutant protein on introduction of imidazole or an imidazole analog into the buffer solution. This chemical rescue demonstrated that the loss of catalytic function resulted from the lack of the histidine residue and not from large scale structural changes. Chemical rescue experiments also provided insight into the function of the histidine residue in the wt enzyme, providing direct evidence that the imidazole side chain of histidine acts as an intermediate proton acceptor/donor, in which protons were accepted by the histidine molecule from one chemical moiety and subsequently donated to a second chemical moiety. Chemical rescue of mutant ion channels has been reported in only a few instances. However, an important property of the M2 ion channel suggested that histidine substitution mutants might be susceptible to chemical rescue by imidazole. This property is the ability of the channel to be inhibited by amantadine, a molecule of approximately the same size as imidazole. We reasoned that it was likely that the diameter of the channel pore might be large enough to accommodate the imidazole molecule, and we applied imidazole buffer to three histidine substitution mutants. It was found that partial rescue was possible for each mutant M2 ion channel and that the imidazole-enhanced currents were able to be inhibited by Cu(II). These results confirm the role of the imidazole side chain of histidine in proton transport across the M2 channel pore and support the hypothesis that the imidazole side chain of histidine acts as an intermediate proton acceptor/donor to relay protons through the aqueous pore of the M2 ion channel while obstructing the flow of larger cations. Mutant and mRNA Synthesis, Culture, and Microinjection of Oocytes—Mutations were introduced by PCR in a high expression vector that has a portion of the Xenopus 5′ globin untranslated region (32Swanson R.

Oocytes were removed from female Xenopus laevis (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI), defolliculated, microinjected with 50 nl of mRNA, and incubated in ND96 (pH 8.5) at 19 °C before use (18Mould J.A.

The amounts of mRNA injected were as follows: wt (∼100 ng), M2-H37G (∼44 ng), M2-H37S (∼22.5 ng), M2-H37T (∼39 ng), M2-H37G/W41A (∼180 ng), and M2-H37G/W41Y (∼308 ng). Oocytes expressing the histidine substitution mutant proteins were incubated in ND96 for at least 24 h before recording, whereas recordings from oocytes expressing the wt protein were made ∼65 h after injection. Recording Solutions—Occytes were bathed in either normal Barth's solution or modified Barth's solution during recording. Normal Barth's solution contained (in mm) 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 0.3 NaNO3, 0.71 CaCl2, 0.82 MgSO4, 15 HEPES (for pH 8.5) or 15 MES (for pH 5.5), osmolality ∼202 mosm/kg. For ion substitution experiments in Tables I and II, Na+ ions were substituted with equimolar concentrations of N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) or K+. Cl- ions were substituted with equimolar concentrations of methanesulfonic acid. Titration of 50 mm imidazole buffer used in chemical rescue and ion substitution experiments required the addition of significant amounts of HCl, resulting in a concomitant increase in osmolality. In this case, control solutions were made isoosmotic by addition of mannitol. In experiments with 50 mm buffer (either MES or imidazole), the solutions contained (in mm)88 Na+, 1 KCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 50 buffer (MES or imidazole or HEPES), 0.3 NaNO3, 0.71 CaCl2, and 0.82 MgSO4. The osmolality of solution with imidazole buffer was ∼260 mosm/kg. The osmolality of the control solutions buffered with MES and HEPES was adjusted with mannitol to ∼260 mosm/kg. The composition of solutions used in Na+ ion substitution experiments (Table III and Table IV) performed in the presence of 50 mm buffer (MES or imidazole) was (in mm) 8.33 Na+, 79.66 NMDG, 1 KCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 50 buffer (MES or imidazole or HEPES), 0.3 NaNO3, 0.71 CaCl2, and 0.82 MgSO4. In experiments to identify compounds capable of chemical rescue, the composition of the solutions was (in mm) 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 0.3 NaNO3, 0.71 CaCl2, 0.82 MgSO4, 15 HEPES (for pH 8.5) or 15 MES/MOPSO/imidazole/lutidine/1,2,4-triazole/1-methylimidazole (for pH 5.5), osmolality ∼202 mosm/kg. The order of presentation of test solutions, the time of recovery in normal solution, and the time during which oocytes were exposed to low pH solutions were important for obtaining recordings in which reversible changes in current flow and acidification occurred and are described in Supplemental Information 1.Table IReversal voltage of M2-H37G mutant ion channel measured at pH 7.5 with 15 mm HEPES buffer Vrev of the amantadine-sensitive component of current was measured.

Note that Vrev for the mutant ion channel is significantly decreased by lowering [Na+], but the difference is less at pH 5.5 than at pH 7.5 (see Table I). Reversal voltage for the wt channel can only be measured at low pH when the channel is open and is unaffected by [Na+]. Reversal voltage for the M2-W41A channel is not affected by [Na+]; the Vrev shown was for oocytes with an average current of approximately the same amplitude at pH 5.5 as for oocytes expressing the wt channel; Vrev for this very active channel quickly changes due to oocyte acidification.GenotypeVrev (88 mm Na+, 1 mm K+)Vrev (88 mm NMDG, 1 mm K+)Vrev (89 mm K+)mVmVmVWT56 ± 2.055 ± 2.151 ± 1.8ap < 0.05(n = 9)(n = 9)(n = 5)H37G8.6 ± 1.0-14 ± 1.2bp < 0.0001.

Oocyte holding potential was -20 mV unless stated otherwise. Recording of intracellular pH was done with silanized microelectrodes filled with protonophore as described previously (19Shimbo K. Brassard D.L. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1336-1346Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence of Living Oocytes—The relative expression levels of the mutant M2 proteins at the surface membrane of the oocytes were measured with respect to that of the wild-type protein. This was done by incubating the oocytes after recording with a solution containing a monoclonal antibody directed against the N-terminal ectodomain of the influenza A M2 protein (monoclonal antibody 14C2) (33Zebedee S.L. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2762-2772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Individual oocytes were washed with ND96 lacking pyruvate and gentamycin (4 °C, three times), incubated in ND96 containing 2% bovine serum albumin (4 °C, 1 h), incubated in primary antibody (1:500 in 2% bovine serum albumin, 4 °C, 1 h), washed with ND96 (4 °C, three times for 10 min), incubated in secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG1 (γ1) labeled with Alexa Fluor® 546 (catalog number A21123, Molecular Probes (Medford, OR), 10 or 20 μg/ml in 2% bovine serum albumin in ND96, 4 °C), and washed with ND96 (4 °C, five times for 10 min). Fluorescence was quantified using a PTI image master microfluorometer (London, Ontario, Canada) with a 20× 0.5 NA objective. Approximately 20% of the lower oocyte surface was imaged upon the photocathode of the CCD camera. The emission spectrum of the fluorescence was confirmed to peak at 546 nm, consistent with acceptably low autofluorescence of the oocyte. For quantification of the fluorescence of each oocyte, the excitation wavelength was 556 nm, and emission was measured for wavelengths longer than 574 nm. Calculation of Free [Cu2+]—The HYSS program (www.chem.leeds.ac.uk/People/Peter_Gans/HySS.htm) was used to calculate the amount of total Cu(II) salt needed to achieve the desired free concentration. This program uses dissociation constants from the NIST data base (version 46). When oocytes expressing the wt M2 protein are bathed in solutions of low pH, but not solutions of high pH, an inward proton current flows across their membrane, and the cytoplasm becomes acidified (Fig. 1A). Previous work had shown that oocytes expressing histidine substitution mutant proteins have membrane currents, but these currents flowed at both high pH and low pH (22Wang C. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1363-1371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We tested whether proton flow was included in the currents of oocytes expressing the histidine substitution mutant proteins by recording intracellular pH of the oocytes and found that acidification occurred when the oocytes were bathed in solutions of low pH (Fig. 1B), showing that protons can pass through the pore of the mutant ion channel in the absence of histidine (see Supplemental Information 2). However, results with mutant enzymes that normally contain histidine as part of a proton transport pathway indicated that proton transport rates are increased when imidazole buffer is used (23Tu C.K. Silverman D.N. Forsman C. Jonsson B.H. Lindskog S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7913-7918Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 24Tu C. Rowlett R.S. Tripp B.C. Ferry J.G. Silverman D.N.

Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We thus applied imidazole buffer to oocytes expressing histidine substitution mutant proteins, and we found that current amplitude and acidification were increased significantly (p < 0.05, n = 4) (Fig. 1B). Increases were not observed for oocytes expressing the wt protein (Fig. 1A). These observations suggested that the presence of imidazole buffer might cause the properties of the mutant ion channels to resemble more closely those of the wild-type ion channel (i.e.“rescue” the channel properties). We thus analyzed the key properties of the mutant ion channels with and without imidazole buffer. Our studies focused on the M2-H37G mutant ion channel because the currents of oocytes expressing this genotype were more reproducible from experiment-to-experiment than those of oocytes expressing the other mutant ion channels. The ion selectivity for the M2-H37G, M2-H37S, and M2-H37T mutant ion channels was studied by measuring their current-voltage relationships in media of various pH, buffer, and ionic composition (Fig. 2 and Tables I and II). These mutant ion channels displayed much less proton selectivity than the wt ion channel when studied at high pH (pH 7.5 or pH 8.5) and low pH (pH 5.5) in MES buffer. Measurements at High pH—Oocytes expressing these mutant ion channels had standing currents when bathed at pH 7.5 or pH 8.5 (Fig. 2A). The standing current for the M2-H37G mutant ion channel became outward when Na+ in the bathing medium was replaced with NMDG (holding voltage -20 mV). This suggested that the mutant ion channel conducted Na+, unlike the wt channel that does not conduct Na+ at all. To test if Na+ carried the inward current of the M2-H37G mutant ion channel at pH 7.5, reversal voltage (Vrev, Table I) was measured and found to be less negative in media containing Na+ (-7.6 ± 0.2 mV, n = 3 mean ± S.E.) than in media containing NMDG (-42 ± 1.7 mV, n = 3), consistent with the conclusion that Na+ is conducted through the mutant channel. Measurements at Low pH—Oocytes expressing the wt M2 ion channel and the M2-H37G mutant ion channel had steady inward currents at pH 5.5 (-20 mV holding voltage, Fig. 2A). The inward current amplitude of oocytes expressing the M2-H37G mutant ion channel decreased when Na+ in the medium was replaced by NMDG, suggesting that the mutant ion channel has Na+ conductance at low pH. However, the amplitude of the decrease achieved by this replacement was not as large when studied at pH 5.5 (0.55 ± 0.05 μA, n = 6) as it was at pH 7.5 (0.99 + 0.2 μA, n = 3; p < 0.05). Consistent with the interpretation that the channel has Na+ conductance at pH 5.5, Na+ replacement made the Vrev considerably more negative for oocytes expressing the M2-H37G mutant ion channel (Table II). In contrast, neither inward current amplitude nor the Vrev (Table II) of oocytes expressing the highly proton-selective wt channel was affected by replacement of Na+ in the bathing medium with NMDG (6Chizhmakov I.V.

J. 1996; 70: 1336-1346Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To test for the possibility that the mutant ion channels also conduct K+ at pH 5.5, [K+] in the bathing medium was increased to 88 mm by replacing Na+. The value of Vrev found under this condition was considerably more positive than for bathing medium containing NMDG and approximately equal to that for medium containing Na+. Moreover, the amplitude of the inward current was larger in the medium with 88 mm K+ than in medium with 88 mm Na+. The results of these alterations of Vrev with the composition of the bathing medium and the larger amplitude of inward current in high K+ medium indicate that the mutant channel also has significant conductance for K+ (Table II). To test for possible conduction of Cl- by the M2-H37G mutant ion channel, [Cl-]in the bathing medium was replaced with methane sulfonate, but the Vrev did not change significantly (data not shown). Thus, the M2-H37G mutant protein forms a poorly selective cation channel. To test the dependence of ion selectivity of the M2-H37G mutant ion channel on the concentration of imidazole buffer in the bathing medium, we measured the current-voltage relationship (Fig. 2B) and Vrev for oocytes that were bathed in solutions with each of several concentrations of imidazole buffer between 1.5 and 50 mm at pH 5.5 (Fig. 3). For these measurements we studied the amantadine-sensitive component of current. Neither the amplitude of the inward current (Fig. 2B) nor the Vrev of oocytes expressing the wt channel varied significantly with imidazole concentration (Fig. 3A), nor was Vrev affected by replacement of Na+ in the bathing medium with NMDG (6Chizhmakov I.V.

However, the Vrev of oocytes expressing the M2-H37G mutant ion channel became more positive with increased imidazole concentration (Fig. 2B and Fig. 3B), consistent with increased proton conductance resulting from higher imidazole concentration. The current-voltage relationship for the M2-H37G mutant ion channel was increased by replacing MES buffer with imidazole buffer (Fig. 2B); this increase in slope occurred for both inward and outward current. In contrast, the current-voltage relationship for the wt ion channel was changed very little by imidazole buffer (Fig. 2B). To test ion selectivity further, we measured the effect on Vrev of replacement of Na+ in the bathing medium with NMDG (50 mm buffer, pH 5.5; Table IV). This was done while the cells were bathed in"

Skp2 has been reported to be overexpressed in a variety of cancer types and to correlate with poor prognosis. We have identified a novel isoform of Skp2 we named Skp2B, which differs from Skp2 only in the C-terminal domain and unlike Skp2 localizes to the cytoplasm. Here, we describe the relative expression of both Skp2 and Skp2B in breast cancer cell lines and in primary breast cancers using quantitative real time RT–PCR. We show that Skp2B mRNA is expressed 10-fold less than Skp2 mRNA in the immortalized but non-transformed breast cell line, 184B5. However, Skp2B is overexpressed as frequently as Skp2, and to higher levels than Skp2 in breast cancer cell lines and primary cancers. Further, we show that cytoplasmic staining is frequent in primary breast cancers. In addition, we found that xenografts expressing Skp2B grow faster than xenografts expressing low levels of Skp2B, and that this effect is independent of p27 degradation. These findings therefore suggest that Skp2B overexpression is also observed in breast cancers and identify Skp2B as a putative oncogene."

Thirteen mammalian TLR 1The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TIR, Toll/interleukin receptor; IFN, interferon; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; FCS, fetal calf serum; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; MLB, mild lysis buffer; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; IRAK, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase. paralogues have now been identified (10 in human and 12 in mice), which recognize a wide variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns from bacteria, viruses, and fungi, as well as certain host-derived molecules (1Beutler B. Nature. 2004; 430: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). TLRs are type I transmembrane glycoproteins with an extracellular domain composed of numerous leucine-rich repeats and an intracellular region containing a TIR homology domain (2Ulevitch R.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 3Bell J.K. Mullen G.E. Leifer C.A. Mazzoni A. Davies D.R. Segal D.M. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 528-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The TIR domains interact with several TIR domain-containing adapter molecules (MyD88, TIRAP, TRIF, and TRAM), which activate a cascade of events resulting in transcription factor induction (4Fitzgerald K.A. Rowe D.C. Barnes B.J. Caffrey D.R. Visintin A. Latz E. Monks B. Pitha P.M. Golenbock D.T. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1043-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). The common signaling feature among all TLRs is the activation of the transcription factor NFκB, which has been implicated in the control of expression of inflammatory cytokines and maturation molecules. A subset of TLRs induces the production of type I interferons (IFNs) (5Srivastava S.K. Singh S.V. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 1701-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 6Takeda K. Akira S. Semin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar), which mediate antiviral, growth-inhibitory, and immunomodulatory responses. Recently, Rakoff-Nahoum et al. (7Rakoff-Nahoum S. Paglino J. Eslami-Varzaneh F. Edberg S. Medzhitov R. Cell. 2004; 118: 229-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3305) Google Scholar) discovered a novel non-immune role of TLRs. They showed that TLR signaling can maintain epithelial homeostasis through proliferation and repair tissue after direct epithelial injury. In general, fibroblasts play an essential role in the latter process by inducing epithelial growth and differentiation not only in the intestinal epithelium but also in the skin and lungs by secreting keratinocyte growth factor, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and transforming growth factor-β, factors required by epithelial cells in their differentiation process to repair tissue after injury (7Rakoff-Nahoum S. Paglino J. Eslami-Varzaneh F. Edberg S. Medzhitov R. Cell. 2004; 118: 229-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3305) Google Scholar). The discovery of the TLR-induced proliferation and the recent work describing a role in tissue repair prompted us to investigate the potential direct link between TLR signaling and cell cycle control. Cell cycle progression of mammalian cells is controlled by a series of cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) complexes which ensure that all the criteria for a faithful cell division have been met. Exposure of quiescent cells (G0 phase of the cell cycle) to mitogens gives rise to activation of cyclin-cdk complexes, with concomitant dissociation and/or degradation of cdk inhibitors p16INK4a, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1. Together with cyclin E-cdk2 complexes, cyclin D-cdk4 complexes phosphorylate proteins of the retinoblastoma family, which normally repress transcription of genes required for S-phase entry. After retinoblastoma phosphorylation, cells traverse S phase and following G2 phase undergo cell division. The tumor suppressor p27Kip1 (p27) plays a critical role in regulating progression through the G1-S phases of the cell cycle (8Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2699-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). The activity of p27 protein is modulated by changes in its abundance principally by degradation, sequestration, and distribution between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of p27 at Thr187 by cyclin-cdk complexes triggers its degradation mediated by SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase (9Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 10Sutterluty H. Chatelain E. Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Senften M. Muller U. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Increased levels of Skp2 or cyclin E result in increased degradation of p27 (11Gstaiger M. Jordan R. Lim M. Catzavelos C. Mestan J. Slingerland J. Krek W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Akt can phosphorylate p27 at Th157 located in its nuclear localization signal and prevents nuclear localization of p27 (12Liang J. Zubovitz J. Petrocelli T. Kotchetkov R. Connor M.K. Han K. Lee J.H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 28706-28713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) found that Akt can phosphorylate p27 at Ser10, Thr187, and Thr198 and that 14-3-3 binds to phosphorylated p27 in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of cyclin D3 or activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase that up-regulates cyclin D1 can result in sequestration of p27 and prevents its association with its targets (15Baldassarre G. Belletti B. Bruni P. Boccia A. Trapasso F. Pentimalli F. Barone M.V. Chiappetta G. Vento M.T. Spiezia S. Fusco A. Viglietto G. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The link between TLR signaling and cell cycle control has yet to be explored, and it is not clear whether certain (or all) TLR ligands can affect proliferation of cells independently of secreted factors. Using the immortalized Rat1 cell line as a model system (16Vlach J. Hennecke S. Alevizopoulos K. Conti D. Amati B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6595-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether TLR signaling was capable of regulating cell cycle progression in fibroblasts with or without a contribution of autologous cytokines and how the signal from activated TLRs is transmitted to key cell cycle regulators. We have found that flagellin, a TLR5 agonist, can induce cell cycle entry by overcoming p27-induced cell cycle arrest though a MyD88-dependent pathway involving Akt. Our findings also suggest that the differential capacity of TLR3 and TLR4 ligands to induce cell cycle progression is dependent on the ability of these ligands to produce IFN-β. Cell Culture—HEK293T and HEK293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, and Rat1 cells were obtained from the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (London, UK). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The p27-inducible Rat1 cell line (17Alevizopoulos K. Catarin B. Vlach J. Amati B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5987-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was cultured in the presence of 2 μg/ml tetracycline to repress p27 production. For proliferation studies, Rat1 cells were arrested by washing them three times with phosphate-buffered saline and replenishing them with serum-free medium. Cells were left for 24 h to ensure that complete arrest had been achieved before stimulation with TLR ligands or fetal bovine serum. TLR Ligands and Reagents—Peptidoglycan (Fluka) was used at 10 μg/ml, LPS (Sigma) was used at the indicated concentrations, R848 was synthesized by the Schering-Plough Chemistry Department (Kenilworth, NJ) and reconstituted in Me2SO to give a stock solution at 10 mm, and a 10 μm final concentration was used to stimulate the cells. Synthetic phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by MWG and used at 10 μg/ml (1018: TGACTGTGAACGTTCGAGATGA). Poly(I:C) (Invivogen) was used at the concentrations indicated. Flagellin from Salmonella munchen (Calbiochem) was used at indicated concentrations. Polymixin (10 μg/ml) was added, where indicated, to block the effects of potential endotoxin contaminants in the flagellin preparations. Rat IFN-β was purchased from PBL. Brefeldin A was supplied by Pharmingen, used at a 1:1000 dilution, and added at the same time as the ligand. Luciferase Assay—Rat1 Cells were transiently transfected in triplicate using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), with 500 ng of either NFκB or IFN-β luciferase reporters (18Hasan U.A. Dollet S. Vlach J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) in 6-well tissue culture plates with cells at 50% confluence. Six h after transfection, cells from each transfected 6-well plate were divided into 24 wells in 96-well plates. The following day, for each transfection, cells were stimulated in triplicate with TLR ligands for 6 h (making a total of 9 wells for each TLR ligand), harvested, and analyzed for luciferase activity using Promega Steady-Glo reporter assay reagents and the Fusion instrument from Packard. Each experiment, as described here, was repeated three times; results generally deviated by <10% of the mean value. Cell Cycle Analysis—For flow cytometric analysis, stimulated or nonstimulated cells were detached with trypsin and fixed in 70% ethanol. Nuclei were stained with propidium iodide at 10 μg/ml to analyze total DNA content. To determine newly synthesized DNA, cells were labeled with 33 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 30 min. Total DNA content and BrdUrd incorporation were determined as described previously (16Vlach J. Hennecke S. Alevizopoulos K. Conti D. Amati B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6595-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry was performed by using a FACSCalibur, and data were analyzed with CELLQUEST software. Small Interfering RNA Treatment of Cells—Small interfering RNA duplexes targeting the coding region of MyD88 (GGAAUGUGACUUCCAAGACCTT) were synthesized by Dharmacon. To determine the efficiency of gene silencing, reporter assay and Western blot analysis were performed. Briefly, cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes (50 nm) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Forty-eight hours after siRNA treatment, cells were lysed for Western blot analysis or transfected with NFκB reporter as outlined above and stimulated with TLR ligands. Cells were also starved for 24 h after siRNA treatment and then stimulated with flagellin (100 ng/ml) or FCS, and cyclin D1 expression was analyzed by Western blotting. For gene knock down proliferation studies, cells were treated with siRNA duplexes, arrested in a serum-free medium, stimulated with the respective ligand, labeled with BrdUrd, and harvested for fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis. Plasmid Constructs—MyD88, TIRAP (MAL), TRIF (TICAM-1), TRAM (TICAM-2), and IRAK were amplified from a human cDNA library and cloned into pCMV vectors. pCMVp27 and pBabePuro-p27 as well as pBabePuro-p27ck and V187 mutants were cloned as described previously (19Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5334-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The dominant active Thr308/Ser473 mutant of Akt (AcAkt) was obtained from Brian Hemmings (20Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar), and the kinase-dead version of Akt (dnAkt) was a kind gift of Boudewijn Burgering (21van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M.T. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. van Lint J. Burgering B.M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13150-13156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Transfection of HEK293T and HEK293 Cells—Cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), with 500 ng of the indicated plasmid together with 250 ng of pCMVGFP for normalization of expression levels. Twenty-four h after transfection, HEK293T cells were lysed for Western blot analysis. Cells transfected with TLRs were stimulated for 18 h with the respective TLR ligand and harvested for Western blot analysis. Biochemical Analysis—Biochemical analysis of harvested cells was performed as described previously (16Vlach J. Hennecke S. Alevizopoulos K. Conti D. Amati B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6595-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Briefly, harvested cells were lysed in mild lysis buffer (MLB) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiotheitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, 20 mm NaF, and 0.3 mm ortho-sodium vanadate. Total cellular protein (an amount between 10 and 40 μg, determined by Bradford assay; Bio-Rad) was used for SDS-NuPAGE and immunoblotting (Invitrogen). After incubation with primary antibodies, proteins were detected with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). For kinase assays, cells were lysed in MLB, and 40–60 μg of total protein was immunoprecipitated with 2 μl of the respective antibody for 2 h at 4 °C in the presence of protein A-Sepharose. Beads were washed four times in MLB and once in kinase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiotheitol). Beads were then resuspended in 40 μl of kinase reaction buffer supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μm ATP, 1 μg of histone H1, and 7 μCi of [32P]ATP and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 4× LDS loading buffer; radiolabeled histone H1 was resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed on PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Analysis—HEK293 cells were transfected with p27 expression plasmid; 6 h later cells were divided into a 6-well plate containing polylysine-coated 22 × 22-mm coverslips. The following day, cells were stimulated with flagellin (100 ng/ml) for 0 and 8 h. Coverslips were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and stained for p27. Briefly, p27 antibody was diluted 1:50 with 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline, added to cells, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed in 0.1% saponin/phosphate-buffered saline, and secondary antibody-Alexa 594 conjugate (1:500 dilution) was added and incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Cells were washed, and coverslips were mounted onto slides using a 1:10 dilution of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (nuclear stain; Invitrogen) in fluoromount (SouthernBiotech), and p27 protein was detected by direct fluorescence microscopy. Photographs were taken at ×40 magnification using Axioplan 2 imaging. Antibodies—The following antibodies were used: anti-p27 C19 (sc-528; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cdk2 M2 (sc-163; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cyclin A H-432 (sc751; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cyclin E M20 (sc-481; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cyclin D1 (2926; Cell Signaling), anti-pRb (9308; Cell Signaling), anti-cdk6 (3136; Cell Signaling), anti-pAKTSer473 (9271s; Cell Signaling), anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (9542s; Cell Signaling), anti-pGSK-3βSer9/21 (9331; Cell Signaling), anti-pGSK-3βTyr–216 (Transduction Laboratories), anti-type I IFN-αβ receptor (21385-1; PBL), anti-MyD88 (CSA-510C; Stressgen), anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-c-Myc 9E10 (Roche Applied Science), anti-IRAK (H273; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science), and goat anti-rabbit Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes). Poly(I:C), LPS, and Flagellin Activate NFκB in Rat1 Cells—To determine which TLRs are functional in Rat1 cells, we transiently transfected cells with a construct containing the luciferase reporter gene under the control of NFκB response element and stimulated cells with various TLR ligands. Stimulation of cells with poly(I:C), LPS, and flagellin (Fig. 1A) had a significant effect on the activity of the NFκB reporter in Rat1 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, the ability of the flagellin preparation from S. munchen to activate the NFκB reporter was not blocked by polymixin and was unlikely to be due to endotoxin contamination. We also tested whether activation of NFκB was mediated though MyD88 using siRNA technology. We found that NFκB responses to flagellin were completed blocked; in response to LPS there was a partially drop in luciferase activity, and in response to poly(I:C) the activity remained constant in the absence of MyD88 (data not shown). These results suggest that TLR3, TLR4, and TLR5 are functional receptors in Rat1 cells, and in further experiments the function of these TLRs in cell cycle regulation was explored. Control of Cell Cycle Entry and Exit by TLR Ligands—We next examined whether ligands for TLR3, TLR4, and TLR5 can induce cell cycle entry. Rat1 cells were starved in medium without serum for 24 h, and then varying amounts of poly(I:C), LPS, or flagellin were added to the culture medium for 20 h (Fig. 1B). Approximately 1% of control cells without any stimulation incorporated BrdUrd. Activation of TLR5 with flagellin (1 ng/ml) induced cell cycle entry in 10% of cells, and increasing the concentration of flagellin to 10 and 100 ng/ml resulted in enhanced incorporation of BrdUrd in 13% and 23% of cells, respectively. Stimulation of cells with poly(I:C) (5 μg/ml) or LPS (50 and 500 ng/ml) did not change BrdUrd incorporation, except for the highest concentration of poly(I:C) (50 μg/ml), which promoted cell proliferation. We also tested whether flagellin in the absence of serum can prevent cells from cell cycle exit and sustain proliferation of cells. Subconfluent growing Rat1 cells were washed in serum-free medium and replenished with fresh medium containing either 10 ng/ml flagellin or 10% FCS (Fig. 1C). Whereas virtually all the cells arrested in G1-G0 14 h following serum withdrawal, the presence of flagellin contributed to sustained proliferation, and 19% of cells incorporated BrdUrd, as compared with 31% of cells continuously growing in serum-containing medium. These experiments suggest that TLR5 signaling is capable of initiating mechanisms that lead to entry of the cells into the S phase of the cell cycle and that prevent cell cycle exit following growth factor deprivation. Interferon Blocks the Proliferative Effect of TLR3 and TLR4 Ligands—Because TLR3 and TLR4 exhibit a different pattern of signal transduction than TLR5, we sought to investigate why poly(I:C) (except for high concentrations) and LPS do not promote proliferation of serum-starved Rat1 cells. We analyzed the responses of several promoter constructs in Rat1 cells to TLR3, TLR4, and TLR5 ligands, and we found that poly(I:C) and LPS can efficiently up-regulate the IFN-β promoter in these cells, in line with reports using transfected HEK293T cells, whereas the response to flagellin was minimal (Fig. 2, A and B). To analyze whether production of IFN following poly(I:C) or LPS stimulation had a negative effect on proliferation of starved Rat1 cells, we treated serum-starved Rat1 cells with poly(I:C) or LPS in the absence or presence of a type I IFN receptor-neutralizing antibody (Fig. 2, C and D). Neutralization of type I IFN signaling unmasked the proliferative effect of poly(I:C) and LPS, whereas the antibody on its own did not promote cell cycle entry of serum-starved cells. Control antibody IgG2a did not have any effect (Fig. 2E). The IFN receptor-neutralizing antibody did not modify the activation of either NFκB or IFN-β promoters by TLR ligands (Fig. 2A), suggesting that IFN does not interfere with the TLR signaling pathway. We have also tested whether addition of rat IFN-β can reverse the proliferative effect of flagellin treatment. As shown in Fig. 2F, exogenous IFN prevents cell cycle entry induced by flagellin but not by FCS. Thus, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR5 promote cell cycle entry of G1-G0-arrested cells, but this effect is masked by the autocrine antiproliferative effect of type I IFN induced by TLR3 and TLR4. TLR5 Signaling Overcomes p27-induced Growth Arrest—We analyzed expression levels of various proteins involved in G1-S-phase transition upon TLR5 signaling (Fig. 3, A and B). Serum-starved Rat1 cells were incubated in the presence of either flagellin or FCS, and cells were harvested at different time points over a 24-h period. Flagellin (10 ng/ml) stimulation resulted in induction of cyclin D1 (4 h) and cyclin A (16 h), disappearance of the cdk inhibitor p27 (16 h), and the appearance of hyperphosphorylated retinoblastoma (16 h), suggesting that flagellin induced cell cycle entry accompanied by typical markers of proliferation, passage though the restriction point and entry into the S phase of the cell cycle. We also noticed that flagellin stimulation induces phosphorylation of Akt, GSK3β dephosphorylation on Tyr216 (22Bhat R.V. Shanley J. Correll M.P. Fieles W.E. Keith R.A. Scott C.W. Lee C.-M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11074-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation on Ser9/21, although with lower potency than FCS. None of the treatments induced apoptosis as judged from the absence of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage (Fig. 3A). We also measured cdk2-associated kinase activity in starved cells and cells stimulated with flagellin and FCS (Fig. 3C). FCS induced cdk2 activity with faster kinetics than flagellin; a 14-h stimulation of cells with FCS resulted in high cdk2-associated activity, whereas an 18-h stimulation with flagellin was needed to observe functional activation of cdk2. To assess whether TLR5 signaling can antagonize inhibitory activity of exogenous p27, we used Rat1 cells infected with a retrovirus expressing p27 under the control of tetracycline-regulatable promoter. Cells in the presence of tetracycline (p27 expression repressed) grew normally (Fig. 4B), whereas tetracycline removal induced high levels of p27 (Fig. 4D), and cells arrested in G0-G1 (Fig. 4A). In cells cultured in the absence of tetracycline, flagellin reduced the levels of p27 (Fig. 4D) and restored a normal growing profile (Fig. 4C). Thus, unlike growth factor stimulation that induced the cell cycle progression with faster kinetics, TLR5 signaling can antagonize the growth-arresting capacity of overexpressed p27. Flagellin-induced Proliferation Involves Intracellular Mechanisms—To analyze whether treatment of Rat1 cells with flagellin or FCS results in secretion of soluble factors that might contribute in an autocrine fashion to the growth-promoting activity of TLR signaling, cells were treated for 2 h with flagellin or FCS, washed, and replenished with fresh medium without serum. Neither serum-treated nor flagellin-treated cell supernatants contained factors that promote cell cycle entry of starved cells (data not shown). We attempted to analyze the composition of cyclin-cdk-p27 complexes following flagellin stimulation in the presence of cycloheximide or actinomycin D to explore whether protein or RNA synthesis was required for changes in the complex composition, but both agents had an effect on the steady-state levels of individual molecules that prevented a reliable analysis of events leading to activation of cyclin-cdk complexes during TLR stimulation. However, blocking protein secretion with brefeldin A had no effect on induction of cyclin D1 levels following flagellin or FCS treatments of serum-starved Rat1 cells (Fig. 4E), suggesting that the effect of TLR5 signaling on cell cycle progression does not occur though an autocrine mechanism. MyD88-dependent Pathway and NFκB Induction Are Required for the Proliferative Effect of Flagellin—To test whether the classical MyD88-dependent pathway is involved in the cell cycle effect observed in Rat1 cells treated with flagellin, we used a siRNA approach to knock down the levels of MyD88. Cells transfected with the indicated siRNAs were serum-starved and then induced with flagellin or FCS for 20 h and labeled with BrdUrd (Fig. 5A). Whereas treatment of cells with scrambled siRNA did not have any effect on cell cycle induction mediated by flagellin or FCS, siRNA specific for MyD88 prevented cell cycle entry induced by flagellin, but not by FCS. We controlled siRNA efficiency by performing a Western blot on MyD88 siRNA-treated Rat1 cells 48 h after transfection (Fig. 5B). In addition, treatment of starved cells with MyD88 siRNA abolished induction of cyclin D1 expression following flagellin treatment (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that the effect of flagellin on cell cycle regulation is mediated by the classical TLR signaling pathway involving the adapter MyD88. MyD88-induced Degradation of p27 Is Blocked by Dominant Negative Akt and Mutation of the p27Thr187 Site—To gain more insight into the mechanism of p27 regulation by TLR signaling, we transfected HEK293T cells with a p27 expression vector in combination with another vector expressing TLR3 or TLR5 (Fig. 6A). After overnight stimulation of cells with flagellin, the levels of p27 decreased significantly in cells transfected with TLR5, whereas poly(I:C) treatment did not have any effect. It is likely that the inability of TLR3 signaling to decrease p27 levels is due to the fact that HEK293T cells are capable of producing type I IFN in response to TLR3 signaling. Stimulation of HEK293 cells, which, in contrast to HEK293T cells, express endogenous TLR3 and TLR5, with flagellin in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor NG, NG′-di-CBZ-l-arginine restored the expression of p27 to the levels observed in cells without flagellin treatment (Fig. 6B), indicating that TLR5 signaling can modulate p27 levels through inducing its proteasome-mediated degradation. These results confirm that TLR5 expression is required for the observed effect of flagellin on the regulation of p27 levels and that flagellin treatment exerts its effect on cell cycle control by inducing degradation of p27. Following ligand stimulation, TLRs associate with different TIR adapters, and in the next experiment, we attempted to determine whether overexpression of TRIF, TIRAP, MyD88, or TRAM in HEK293T cells has any effect on expression of exogenous p27. We have found that among all the TIR adapters tested, only expression of MyD88 is capable of reducing the levels of p27 (Fig. 6C). Co-transfection of IRAK-1 also suppressed p27 expression (Fig. 6C). However, we did not detect p27 in complexes with IRAK or MyD88 (data not shown). The levels of p27 can be regulated by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (23Blain S.W. Scher H.I. Cordon-Cardo C.

https://openalex.org/W2100806743,"The red-most fluorescence emission of photosystem I (733 nm at 4 K) is associated with the Lhca4 subunit of the antenna complex. It has been proposed that this unique spectral feature originates from the low energy absorption band of an excitonic interaction involving chlorophyll A5 and a second chlorophyll a molecule, probably B5 (Morosinotto, T., Breton, J., Bassi, R., and Croce, R. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 49223–49229). Because of the short distances between chromophores in Lhc proteins, the possibility that other pigments are involved in the red-shifted spectral forms could not be ruled out. In this study, we have analyzed the pigment-pigment interactions between nearest neighboring chromophores in Lhca4. This was done by deleting individual chlorophyll binding sites by mutagenesis, and analyzing the changes in the spectroscopic properties of recombinant proteins refolded in vitro. The red-shifted (733 nm) fluorescence peak, the major target of this analysis, was lost upon mutations affecting sites A4, A5, and B5 and was modified by mutating site B6. In agreement with the shorter distance between chlorophylls A5 and B5 (7.9 Å) versus A4 and A5 (12.2 Å) in Lhca4 (Ben-Shem, A., Frolow, F., and Nelson, N. (2003) Nature 426, 630–635), we conclude that the low energy spectral form originates from an interaction involving pigments in sites A5 and B5. Mutation at site B6, although inducing a 15-nm blue-shift of the emission peak, maintains the red-shifted emission. This implies that chromophores responsible for the interaction are conserved and suggests a modification in the pigment organization. Besides the A5–B5 pair, evidence for additional pigment-pigment interactions between chlorophylls in sites B3–A3 and B6–A6 was obtained. However, these features do not affect the red-most spectral form responsible for the 733-nm fluorescence emission band. The red-most fluorescence emission of photosystem I (733 nm at 4 K) is associated with the Lhca4 subunit of the antenna complex. It has been proposed that this unique spectral feature originates from the low energy absorption band of an excitonic interaction involving chlorophyll A5 and a second chlorophyll a molecule, probably B5 (Morosinotto, T., Breton, J., Bassi, R., and Croce, R. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 49223–49229). Because of the short distances between chromophores in Lhc proteins, the possibility that other pigments are involved in the red-shifted spectral forms could not be ruled out. In this study, we have analyzed the pigment-pigment interactions between nearest neighboring chromophores in Lhca4. This was done by deleting individual chlorophyll binding sites by mutagenesis, and analyzing the changes in the spectroscopic properties of recombinant proteins refolded in vitro. The red-shifted (733 nm) fluorescence peak, the major target of this analysis, was lost upon mutations affecting sites A4, A5, and B5 and was modified by mutating site B6. In agreement with the shorter distance between chlorophylls A5 and B5 (7.9 Å) versus A4 and A5 (12.2 Å) in Lhca4 (Ben-Shem, A., Frolow, F., and Nelson, N. (2003) Nature 426, 630–635), we conclude that the low energy spectral form originates from an interaction involving pigments in sites A5 and B5. Mutation at site B6, although inducing a 15-nm blue-shift of the emission peak, maintains the red-shifted emission. This implies that chromophores responsible for the interaction are conserved and suggests a modification in the pigment organization. Besides the A5–B5 pair, evidence for additional pigment-pigment interactions between chlorophylls in sites B3–A3 and B6–A6 was obtained. However, these features do not affect the red-most spectral form responsible for the 733-nm fluorescence emission band. The low-temperature fluorescence emission spectrum of leaves shows two major components, peaking at 685 and 735 nm. Fractionation of the thylakoid membranes showed that the former emission is associated to photosystem II, located in the grana stacks and the latter to photosystem I, in stroma membrane domains. In each photosystem, light is absorbed by antenna Chls 1The abbreviations used are: Chl, chlorophyll; Lhc, light harvesting complex; LT, low temperature; PSI(II), photosystem I(II); WT, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: Chl, chlorophyll; Lhc, light harvesting complex; LT, low temperature; PSI(II), photosystem I(II); WT, wild type. and efficiently transferred to the reaction center, where charge separation takes place. In photosystem II, the reaction center absorbs around 680 nm and it is isoenergetic with its antenna (1Jennings R.C. Bassi R. Zucchelli G. Dainese P. Garlaschi F.M. Res. Photosynth. 1992; I: 291-294Google Scholar). In photosystem I, instead, a significant Chl pool, responsible for the 735-nm emission, absorbs at wavelengths longer than 700 nm, the absorption maximum of the primary donor. This causes most of the energy to be stored at energies lower than that of the reaction center, implying up-hill energy transfer prior to charge separation (2Croce R. Zucchelli G. Garlaschi F.M. Bassi R. Jennings R.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8572-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).The presence of Chls absorbing at energy lower than the primary donor is the fingerprinting of photosystem I in all organisms (3Gobets B. van Grondelle R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1057: 80-99Crossref Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In higher plants, however, photosystem I is enriched in low-energy forms, which extend the absorption into the far-red region of the spectrum, providing an advantage for light absorption of shaded leaves in dense canopies (4Rivadossi A. Zucchelli G. Garlaschi F.M. Jennings R.C. Photosynt. Res. 2003; 60: 209-215Crossref Google Scholar). These spectral forms are concentrated in the LHCI complex (5Haworth P. Watson J.L. Arntzen C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 724: 151-158Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar), which is composed of 4 subunits, organized in a half-moon shaped structure, located on one side of the PSI-core complex (6Ben Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N. Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The four Lhca complexes, namely Lhca 1 to 4, belong to the Lhc multigenic family, which contains also all the antenna proteins of photosystem II (7Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Lhca proteins have molecular masses between 21 and 24 kDa, they coordinate Chl a, Chl b, lutein, violaxanthin, and small amounts of β-carotene and they are found in dimeric form upon purification in mild conditions. From x-ray structural analysis, 13–14 Chl molecules have been found to be coordinated to each Lhca subunit (6Ben Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N. Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar); nevertheless, measurements on purified complexes showed that only 10–11 Chls are bound to the apoprotein upon purification or reconstitution (8Croce R. Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Bioenerg. 2002; 1556: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). All LHCI components have red-shifted emission forms, albeit at different energies: Lhca1 and Lhca2 emit at 701 nm, whereas Lhca3 emits at 725 nm, and Lhca4 at 733 nm, as revealed from the analysis of recombinant proteins (8Croce R.

It has been shown that an excitonic interaction between Chl a molecules is responsible for the large shift in the absorption (12Morosinotto T. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49223-49229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and that this is associated with the presence of an asparagine residue as a ligand for Chl A5 (12; Chl binding sites nomenclature from Ref. 13Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar), suggesting that this Chl is directly involved in the interaction.One of the major requirements for strong pigment-pigment coupling is a short distance between the interacting chromophores. In this work, we have used the recent structural data of the Lhca4 protein (6Ben Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N. Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) as guide for mutation analysis of residues coordinating chlorophylls in the Lhca4 complex. The analysis of these mutants provides information on the presence of pigment-pigment interactions within this PSI subunit, which hosts the red-most shifted spectral forms, and provides evidence for the Chl a molecule bound to site B5 being the interacting partner of Chl A5.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructions and Isolation of Overexpressed Lhca Apoproteins from Bacteria—cDNAs of Lhca4 from Arabidopsis thaliana (8Croce R.

Chlorophyll to carotenoid ratio and Chl a/b ratio were measured independently by fitting the spectrum of acetone extracts with the spectra of individual purified pigments (18Croce R. Canino G. Ros F. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7334-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).Spectroscopy—The absorption spectra at room temperature and 77 K (LT) were recorded using a SLM-Aminco DK2000 spectrophotometer, in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20% (w/v) glycerol (70% at LT), and 0.06% n-dodecyl-α(β)-d-maltoside. The wavelength sampling step was 0.4 nm, scan rate 100 nm/min, and optical path length 1 cm. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured using a Jasco FP-777 spectrofluorimeter and were corrected for instrumental response. The samples were excited at 440, 475, and 500 nm. The spectral bandwidth was 5 nm (excitation) and 3 nm (emission). Chlorophyll concentration was about 0.02 μg/ml in 60% glycerol and 0.03% n-dodecyl-α(β)-d-maltoside.The CD spectra were measured at 10 °C on a Jasco 600 spectropolarimeter. The wavelength sampling step at 0.5 nm, scan rate 100 nm/min, and spectra were recorded with eight accumulations. The OD of the samples was 1 at the maximum in the Qy transition for all complexes and the samples were in the same solution described for absorption measurements. All spectra were normalized to the polypeptide concentration based on the Chl binding stoichiometry.RESULTSMutation analysis was performed on Chl binding residues of the Lhca4 complex. The putative binding ligands of Chls A3, A4, A5, B3, B5, and B6 (nomenclature from Ref. 13Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar) were substituted with residues that could not coordinate the central magnesium of the Chls. All mutations are indicated in Table I, where the correspondence with Chl binding residue nomenclature in Ref. 6Ben Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N.

After expression in bacteria and in vitro refolding with purified pigments, the reconstituted complexes were purified by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and anionic exchange chromatography. All mutants yielded stable reconstituted monomeric complexes, as shown from their mobility in glycerol gradient (data not shown). The only exception was mutant A3: in this case, no stable pigment-protein complex was obtained. This mutation most probably affects the stability of carotenoid binding site L1, as was previously shown for the homologous protein Lhca1 (19Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R.

Recombinant WT Lhca4 bound Chl a and b in a ratio of 2.5 plus lutein and violaxanthin in a ratio of 5.0, in agreement with previous results (8Croce R. Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Bioenerg. 2002; 1556: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). On the basis of the differences in Chl a/b ratio, it may be suggested that mutants A4 and B3 lose preferentially Chl a as compared with the WT, whereas mutants A5, B5, and B6 lose preferentially Chl b.Mutant B3 showed an increased xanthophyll content with respect to Chl a+b, but the ratio between lutein and violaxanthin was unchanged as compared with the WT. In all other mutants the Chl/carotenoid ratio was very similar to the WT, but they all showed a higher lutein/violaxanthin ratio, indicating a partial loss of violaxanthin.Effect of Mutations on the Fluorescence Emission Spectrum— The effect of each mutation on the red forms of Lhca4 was assessed from the analysis of the fluorescence emission spectra of the complexes, measured at 77 K, which are shown in Fig. 1.The emission spectrum of the B3 mutant is identical to that of WT, implying that this chlorophyll is not involved in the red-most emission. On the contrary, complete depletion of the red forms was observed in mutants A5 and B5. Mutant A4 also loses the 733-nm emission, but retains emission around 700 nm, detectable from the asymmetric broadening of the low-energy side of the 685-nm peak. Finally, in mutant B6 red forms are still present, but the peak is blue-shifted by 15 nm as compared with WT.Absorption and Circular Dichroism Spectra—To get information on the spectral characteristics of the Chls affected by the mutations, the absorption spectra of WT and mutant complexes were measured at 77 K (Fig. 2). Three major features were visible in the WT spectrum: the peak at 645 nm because of Chl b, the bulk Chl a absorption with maximum at 674 nm, and the red tail at wavelengths >700 nm. Consistent with pigment analysis, the spectra of mutants A5, B5, and B6 showed a strong decrease of the absorption in the Chl b region as compared with WT (Fig. 2A). Mutants A4 and B3, instead, did not show significant differences in this region (Fig. 2B). The bulk Chl a peak was essentially conserved in the spectra of all mutants, with limited blue shifts (around 2 nm) in mutants A4, A5, and B5. On the contrary, the absorption component at >700 nm was affected in all samples but the B3 mutant, which was identical to the WT in this spectral region. Mutations at sites A5, A4, and B5, completely abolished this spectral feature. In the B6 mutant the absorption above 700 nm, although present, was clearly shifted to shorter wavelengths, consistent with the observed blue shift in fluorescence emission from 733 to 718 nm (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Absorption spectra (77 K) of WT and mutant Lhca4 complexes. The spectra were normalized to the same area in the 620–740-nm spectral region. A, A5 (dashed); B5 (dotted), B6 (dash-dotted), and WT (solid); B, A4 (dashed), B3 (dotted), and WT (solid).

The negative signal in the absorption region of Chl b (630–655 nm) was strongly affected in mutants B5 and B6, where the signal was, respectively, missing or strongly reduced in amplitude. Mutants B3 and A4 did not show detectable differences in this region, in agreement with pigment composition and absorption spectra. In this respect, mutant A5 was an exception because, despite losing Chl b, it conserved a Chl b CD signal identical to WT, indicating that the Chl b lost upon mutation at this site is probably not involved in interactions with other chromophores or that the interaction is CD silent.Fig. 3CD spectra of Lhca4 WT and mutants. CD spectra of mutants (solid) compared with Lhca4-WT (dashed). All spectra were normalized to the Chl content. A, B3; B, A4; C, B5; D, A5; E, B6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the Chl a region, the main negative band was shifted to shorter wavelengths in mutants A5 and A4. This shift has been reported to be associated to the loss of the pigment-pigment interaction responsible of the red forms (12Morosinotto T. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49223-49229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The main difference of mutant B6 as compared with WT was detected in the 670–675-nm range, where the spectrum of the mutant showed a negative component, opposite to the WT. The CD spectrum of the B3 mutant was identical to the WT but for the absence of a positive contribution at 660 nm. The CD spectrum of the B5 mutant was completely different from the spectrum of the WT thus suggesting that Chl organization in this complex is strongly affected.DISCUSSIONIt has previously been suggested that the red absorption typical for Lhca complexes represents the low-energy band of an excitonic interaction having the high-energy term at 683 nm (12Morosinotto T. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49223-49229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Site-selected fluorescence measurements indicate that the red-most absorption band of Lhca4 peaks at 708 nm at 4 K, 2R. Croce, T. Morosinotto, J. A. Ihalainen, A. Chojnicka, J. P. Dekker, R. van Grondelle, and R. Bassi, manuscript in preparation. thus yielding a value of 260 cm–1 for the interaction energy. On this basis, calculation of the distance between the interacting Chls, assuming the best possible geometric arrangement, yields to a value of 8.8 Å or below. From the structure of Lhca4 (6Ben Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N. Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), four pairs of Chls can accomplish this requirement: A5–B5, whose center to center distance is 7.9 Å, A3–B3 (8.13 Å), B6–A6 (8.35 Å), and A4–B4 (1031) (8.334 Å) (see Table II, listing the center-center distance of all Chls as calculated from the structure of Ref. 6Ben Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N. Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The analysis of mutant proteins described here is meant to reveal which of these chromophores are responsible for the red forms.Table IIDistance between Lhca4 ChlsA1A2A3A4A5A6A7B1B2B3B4 (1031)B5B6A113.824.916.117.616.423.98.9318.928.424.315.919.7A213.814.917.621.318.325.621.29.2615.524.624.525.3A324.914.919.920.322.522.928.916.18.123.126.928.3A416.117.619.912.225.325.918.815.724.98.316.327.7A517.621.320.312.218.915.115.224.027.716.27.918.5A616.418.322.525.318.912.315.826.827.232.518.58.3A723.925.622.925.915.112.320.332.030.030.716.310.1B18.921.228.918.815.215.820.326.534.226.09.914.9B218.99.216.115.724.026.832.026.515.320.728.333.0B328.415.58.124.927.727.230.034.215.328.133.834.2B4 (1031)24.324.623.18.316.232.530.726.020.728.121.334.2B515.924.526.916.37.918.516.39.928.333.821.315.7B619.725.328.327.718.58.310.114.933.034.234.215.7 Open table in a new tab Changes in Pigment Composition Induced by Mutations— Recombinant monomeric Lhca4 binds 10 ± 1 Chls with a a/b ratio of 2.5 and two xanthophyll molecules: lutein in site L1 and both lutein and violaxanthin in site L2 (8Croce R. Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Bioenerg. 2002; 1556: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Ideally, mutation at each Chl binding site would yield loss of only one Chl molecule. However, previous analysis of several Lhc complexes showed that, besides the target Chl, additional chromophores might be lost, in particular chlorophylls and xanthophylls bound to neighboring sites, because of the highly cooperative nature of pigment binding in this protein family. The occupancy of Chl binding site A1 and xanthophyll binding site L1, respectively, hosting Chl a and lutein, were shown to be essential for protein folding in all Lhc proteins analyzed so far. In fact, mutants affected in these sites in most cases were unable to fold in vitro (19Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36253-36261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 21Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33510-33521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).Lhca4 mutants A4 and B3 exhibit a lower Chl a/b ratio as compared with the WT, suggesting loss of Chl a molecules. B3 mutant shows a lower Chl/carotenoid ratio as compared with the WT, but the same values for the lutein/violaxanthin ratio, indicating that there is no loss of carotenoids. By normalizing to the carotenoid content, it can thus be concluded that this mutation affects the binding of one Chl a molecule. In the case of the A4 mutant, the Chl/carotenoid ratio is identical to the WT, but the amount of violaxanthin is decreased, indicating a partial loss of carotenoids. No changes in the Chl b region were observed in the absorption and CD spectra, suggesting that no Chl b is lost upon mutation at site A4. Normalization to the Chl b content indicates that this mutation affects the binding of one Chl a molecule and partially destabilizes one carotenoid binding site. It is most likely that the site affected is L2, which is located in the proximity of Chl A4 and which accommodates violaxanthin and lutein. The remaining three mutants, A5, B5, and B6 had a Chl a/b ratio higher than the WT, suggesting preferential loss of Chl b. In the case of mutants A5 and B5 the Chl/carotenoid ratio is similar to the WT, but the lutein/violaxanthin ratio is higher, again suggesting loss of carotenoids from site L2, consistent with the results of the mutational analysis in Lhca1, Lhca2, (19Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36253-36261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Croce R. Morosinotto T. Ihalainen J.A.

Moreover, normalization to the carotenoid content would give a Chl a content higher than in the WT for both complexes, contrasting with the loss of Chl a absorption forms observed in the spectra. On this basis, we suggest that mutation at site A5 actually induces the loss of one Chl a and one Chl b with a concomitant partial loss of the xanthophyll in site L2, thus accounting for the change in Chl a/b and in lutein/violaxanthin ratio. The effect of the mutation at site B5 is stronger, as suggested by the large changes in the CD spectrum and by the strong reduction of the thermal stability of the complex (60% of WT, data not shown). Furthermore, the lutein/violaxanthin and Chl a/b values are strongly increased with respect to the WT. To explain these data, we suggest that this mutation leads to the loss of four Chls (2 Chl a and 2 Chl b) and of the carotenoid in site L2. The mutant at site B6 shows a higher Chl/carotenoid ratio and a slightly higher lutein/violaxanthin ratio as compared with WT, indicating xanthophyll loss, consistent with the phenotype of the same mutants in other Lhc complexes (19Morosinotto T.

All other mutants are instead affected, although to a different extent, on their red emission component. In the following, we discuss the properties of the individual Lhca4 chromophores and the effects of the mutation of the corresponding binding sites.Mutant B3—The H185F mutant loses one Chl a molecule thus suggesting that a Chl a is bound to site B3 as was the case in the homologous Lhca1 complex (19Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36253-36261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).In the CD spectrum the main difference with respect to WT is the disappearance of the 660-nm (+) signal. This feature suggests that Chl a in site B3 interacts with a neighboring pigment. Unfortunately, no clear changes can be observed in other spectral regions: possibly the expected negative component of the interaction is hidden by other signals. Because the nearest neighbor of Chl B3 is Chl A3 (8.13 Å), the most likely hypothesis is that the positive CD band at 660 nm is the signature of an interaction between Chls A3 and B3.The absorption difference spectrum shows three positive bands with maxima at 660, 672, and 680 nm (Fig. 4). The first band corresponds to the signal lost in the CD spectrum and likely represents the high-energy term of the Chl-Chl interaction. The remaining two peaks are possibly a combination of the low-energy band of the interaction, which is lost in the mutant, and of the absorption of the now monomeric Chl A3, still present in the complex. The absence of negative components in the spectrum can be explained by proposing that the redistribution of the oscillator strength between the two interacting Chls favors the low energy band and that the shift induced by the interaction is small. In this case, the expected negative contribution in the difference absorption spectrum, deriving from the now monomeric Chl A3 can be hidden by the positive signal of the low energy band of the dimers.

IIAMan is dimeric and has two symmetrically related binding sites per dimer for HPr. A convex surface on HPr, formed primarily by helices 1 and 2, interacts with a deep groove at the interface of the two subunits of IIAMan. The interaction surface on IIAMan is predominantly helical, comprising helix 3 from the subunit that bears the active site His-10 and helices 1, 4, and 5 from the other subunit.

The initial phosphorylation steps from phosphoenolpyruvate to enzyme I, and subsequently to the histidine phosphocarrier protein, HPr, are common to all branches of the pathway. The subsequent phosphorylation steps involve sugar-specific enzymes II, which fall into four major families (glucose, mannitol, mannose, and lactose/chitobiose), that bear no sequence and, in the majority of cases, no structural similarity to one another (2Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Robillard G.T. Broos J. Biochim. Biophys.

The functional organization, however, of the enzymes II is similar; there are two cytoplasmic domains, IIA and IIB, and a transmembrane sugar permease domain, IIC (and in some instances, IID as well), which may or may not be covalently linked to one another. The protein-protein complexes within the PTS are generally weak and have proved refractory to crystallization. These complexes, in which proteins are able to recognize multiple and structurally diverse partners using similar interaction surfaces, provide a paradigm for understanding the structural basis of protein-protein interactions. In a series of papers, we have reported the solution structures of the enzyme I (N-terminal domain)-HPr complex (5Garrett D.S. Seok Y.-J. Peterkofsky A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct.

In the present work, we extended these studies to the solution structure determination of the 48-kDa dimeric IIAMan-HPr complex from the mannose branch of the PTS. The mannose transporter (IIMan) is composed of four domains expressed as two proteins, the soluble IIABMan component that associates with the integral membrane IICDMan permease (9Erni B. Zanolari B.

The A and B domains of IIABMan are linked by a 20-residue flexible linker and contain the first (His-10) and second (His-175) phosphorylation sites, respectively, of the IIMan complex (11Erni B.

IIBMan mediates contacts with the transmembrane IICDMan permease and phosphorylates the incoming mannose at the O-6′ position. The IIAMan domain is responsible for dimer formation of IIABMan, and its crystal structure has been solved at 1.7-Å resolution (14Nunn R.S. Markovic-Hously Z. Genovesio-Taverne J.-C. Flükiger K.

Reson. 2001; 152: 288-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of IIAMan—E. coli chromosomal DNA was used as the template to amplify, by PCR, the region corresponding to the A domain (IIAMan) of the soluble IIABMan component of the mannose transporter (11Erni B. Zanolari B. Graff P. Kocher H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18733-18741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The forward PCR primer 5′-AAGGAGGTAGCATATGACCATTGCTA-3′), spanning the region from bases 363 to 388 (NCBI accession number J02699), contained an engineered NdeI site (underlined); the reverse primer 5′-TGGTGCTGCGGCAGCGGATCCTGGCTATTATTTTTCAACCGGTTT-3′, spanning the region from bases 813 to 769, contained an engineered BamHI site (underlined) and a tandem pair of in-frame termination codons (italics). This PCR product was designed to express a peptide encoding amino acid residues Thr-1 to Lys-136 preceded by an N-terminal methionine. The NdeI- and BamHI-cut PCR product was purified and cloned into the corresponding sites of the expression vector pRE1. The selected clone was verified by DNA sequencing. The expression vector was shown to express a protein of the expected size. IIAMan was then subcloned into a modified pET32a vector engineered to express wild-type IIAMan (residues 1–136) without a fusion partner or any additional residues. The recombinant plasmid pSP100 for HPr expression (20Garrett D.S. Seok Y.-J. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4393-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) was likewise subcloned into a modified pET32a vector engineered to express wild-type protein (residues 1–85) without a fusion partner or any additional residues. The recombinant IIAMan and HPr plasmids were introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for protein expression and induced at an A600 nm ∼1 with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were grown in either Luria-Bertani medium, for unlabeled proteins, or in minimal medium (with either H2O or D2O, depending on the isotope-labeling scheme) supplemented as appropriate with 15NH4Cl, [13C6]glucose, [2H7]glucose, [2H7,13C6]glucose, [13C5,3-2H1]α-ketoisovalerate, and/or [13C4,3,3-2H2]α-ketobutyrate, to generate various isotopically labeled samples. The latter three carbon sources were used to generate (Ile/Leu/Val)-methyl-protonated (but otherwise fully deuterated) 13C-labeled protein (21Goto N.K. Gardner K.H. Mueller G.A. Willis R.C. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Two samples of each protein were produced: 15N/13C and 15N/13C/2H/(Ile/Leu/Val)-methyl-protonated IIAMan, and 15N/13C, and 2H/15N HPr. Purification of IIAMan—After induction, cells were pelleted, resuspended in 100 ml (per 1 liter of culture) of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, and lysed by three passages through a microfluidizer. The supernatant solution was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose anion exchange column in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 50 mm NaCl and eluted with a 50-mm to 0.7-m NaCl gradient. The pooled peak containing IIAMan was concentrated and passed through a Superdex-75 gel filtration column equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 200 mm NaCl. The pooled fractions containing IIAMan were then diluted 1:3 with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, loaded onto a Mono Q anion exchange column, and eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. Finally, the buffer was exchanged into NMR buffer containing 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5. Purification of HPr—Harvested cells were resuspended into 30 ml (per 1 liter of culture) of 6 m guanidinium chloride, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and lysed by sonication. The pellet was spun out and the supernatant solution dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl. The pelleted precipitate was then discarded and the supernatant solution subjected to 20% ammonium sulfate precipitation. The resulting supernatant solution was subjected to 80% ammonium sulfate precipitation. The pellet was dissolved in 8 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA and fractionated on a Superdex-75 gel filtration column in the same buffer. The fractions containing HPr were pooled and exchanged into the NMR buffer (40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5). NMR Spectroscopy—All complexes (in 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and either 90% H2O/10% D2O or 100% D2O) for NMR were prepared using 1:3 molar ratios in binding sites (0.4–0.5 mm to 1.2–1.5 mm) with the unlabeled protein in excess. Almost all experiments carried out on complexes with isotopically labeled IIAMan or HPr involved uniformly 15N/13C-labeled protein, with the exception of the measurement of dipolar couplings, which made use of complexes comprising either 2H/15N/13C(Ile/Leu/Val)-methyl-protonated IIAMan or 2H/15N-labeled HPr. NMR spectra were collected at 35 °C on Bruker DMX500, DMX600, DRX600, DMX750, and DRX800 spectrometers equipped with either x,y,z-shielded gradient triple resonance probes or z-shielded gradient triple resonance cryoprobes. Spectra were processed with the NMRPipe package (22Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfiefer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Sequential and side-chain assignment of free IIAMan was performed using three-dimensional triple resonance through-bond scalar correlation experiments (three-dimensional HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HB-HA(CBCACO)NH, C(CCO)NH, H(CCO)NH, and HNCO) in conjunction with three-dimensional 15N-, 13C-, 13C/13C-, and 15N/15N-separated NOE experiments (24Clore G.M.

Assignments of IIAMan and HPr in the complex were based on the free assignments (minimal chemical shift changes) together with data from three-dimensional HNCO and HNCA triple resonance correlation experiments and three-dimensional 13C-, 13C/13C-, and 15N-separated NOE experiments. Intermolecular NOEs were recorded on saturated complexes with one partner 15N/13C-labeled and the unlabeled component in 3-fold molar excess of binding sites using three-dimensional 13C-separated/12C-filtered NOE experiments (26Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 22-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Side-chain torsion angle restraints were derived from 3JNCγ and 3JC′Cγ coupling constants measured using quantitative J correlation spectroscopy (27Bax A. Vuister G.W. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Wang A.C. Tschudin R. Zhu G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 79-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) in conjunction with short mixing time three-dimensional 13C-separated NOE spectra (26Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 22-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The tautomeric states of the active site histidines were confirmed using a long-range heteronuclear single quantum coherence correlation spectrum (28Pelton J.G. Torchia D.A. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Residual Dipolar Couplings—1DNH RDCs were measured by taking the difference in 1JNH couplings between liquid crystalline (5% polyethylene glycol/hexanol with a surfactant to alcohol ratio of 0.96; (29Ruckert M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Crossref Scopus (540) Google Scholar)) and isotropic (water) media. Small variations in the effective concentration of the liquid crystalline medium between samples were corrected by linear scaling of the measured RDCs based on accurate measurement of the deuterium splitting of the HOD signal. For HPr, a 2H/15N-labeled sample was employed, and 1JNH couplings were determined from a two-dimensional TROSY-based (30Peruvshin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For IIAMan, a 2H/15N/13C/1H-methyl-labeled sample was used, and 1JNH couplings were measured using a three-dimensional HNCO-TROSY-based experiment (31Tugarinov V. Muhandiram R. Ayed A. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 10025-10035Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Further details are discussed in the “Results.” Structure Calculations—NOE-derived interproton distance restraints were classified into loose approximate distance ranges of 1.8–2.7, 1.8–3.5, 1.8–5.0, and 1.8–6.0 Å corresponding to strong, medium, weak, and very weak NOE cross-peak intensities, respectively; an additional 0.5 Å was added to the upper distance bound of distance restraints involving methyl groups (0.5 Å/methyl group). NOEs involving non-stereospecifically assigned methyl, methylene, and aromatic protons were represented by a (Σr-6)-1/6 sum (26Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 22-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The error range employed for χ1 torsion angle restraints (represented by square well potentials) was ±20° when a unique rotamer could be identified and ±80° when the torsion angle could be narrowed down to two of the three rotamers. Structures were calculated using conjoined rigid body/torsion angle-simulated annealing (8Cornilescu G. Lee B.R. Cornilescu C. Wang G. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. J. Biol.

The minimized target function comprises the experimental NMR restraints (NOE-derived interproton distances, torsion angles, and residual dipolar couplings), a quartic van der Waals repulsion term for the non-bonded contacts (33Clore G.M.

The interaction is in fast exchange on the chemical shift time scale, and from a maximum chemical shift perturbation of ∼600 Hz (for the backbone amide proton of Ser-72) at a 1H frequency of 600 MHz, one can deduce that the lifetime of the complex must be less than ∼250 μs (i.e. <<1/2πΔmax, where Δmax is the maximum observed chemical shift perturbation in Hz). A plot of the chemical shift changes for a number of residues as a function of the molar ratio of HPr to IIAMan subunits is shown in Fig. 1; a simultaneous non-linear least squares fit to all the data yields an equilibrium dissociation constant of 28.4 ± 0.5 μm. The backbone 1HN and 15N chemical shift perturbations observed upon complex formation are small; only a single residue of IIAMan (Ser-72) exhibits a combined 1HN/15N chemical shift perturbation (ΔH/N = [(Δδ1HN)2 + (Δδ15N)2]1/2) in excess of 600 Hz (at a 1H frequency of 600 MHz); four residues of HPr (Lys-24, Leu-47, Phe-48, Lys-49) exhibit ΔH/N perturbations in the 200–400 Hz range; and three residues of IIAMan (Leu-25, Ala-104, Thr-121) and five residues of HPr (Leu-14, Ala-20, Glu-25, Ala-44, Ser-46) display ΔH/N perturbations in the 100–200 Hz range. These observations, together with the excellent agreement between the measured backbone 1DNH RDC and those calculated by SVD best-fitting against the crystal structures of free HPr and free IIAMan (see below), indicate that there are no significant perturbations in the backbone coordinates upon complexation within the limits of the NMR method. Structure Determination—The structure was determined using conjoined rigid body/torsion angle dynamics (8Cornilescu G. Lee B.R. Cornilescu C. Wang G. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. J. Biol.

These data were supplemented by intramolecular NOE and 3J coupling constant data related to the interfacial side chains. In this approach, the coordinates for the backbone and non-interfacial side chains of the two proteins, taken from the crystal structures of free IIAMan (14Nunn R.S. Markovic-Hously Z.

Waygood E.B. Delbaere L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22490-22501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are treated as rigid bodies that are free to rotate and translate, whereas the interfacial side chains are given full torsional degrees of freedom. The intermolecular NOE-derived interproton distance restraints provide semi-quantitative translational and orientational information, whereas the 1DNH backbone RDCs (acting in concert, because the backbone conformations are fixed) provide highly accurate, quantitative orientational restraints (18Clore G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9021-9025Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 41Bax A. Kontaxis G. Tjandra N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 127-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). An example of the quality of the intermolecular NOE data is shown in Fig. 2. In the case of a weak complex with a 1:1 binding stoichiometry, it is a simple matter to obtain samples in which the uniformly, isotopically 15N- and/or 13C-labeled partner is fully bound by ensuring the presence of a suitable excess of the unlabeled partner (5Garrett D.S. Seok Y.-J. Peterkofsky A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 6Wang G. Louis J.M. Sondej M. Seok Y.-J. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42289-42298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). RDCs for the complex are then measured on the labeled partner, and two samples are employed, with isotope labeling of one partner in one sample and the other partner in the second sample. Under such conditions, the alignment tensors describing the RDCs measured on both samples relate to the same complex and are therefore identical. The situation in the case of the IIAMan-HPr complex, however, is more complicated because IIAMan is a dimer with two equivalent binding sites for HPr. Because the equilibrium dissociation constant for the complex is relatively weak (∼28 μm), it is not feasible to obtain a sample in which both HPr and IIAMan are simultaneously fully bound. RDCs recorded on a sample of labeled IIAMan in the presence of excess HPr will exclusively reflect the 1:2 IIAMan(dimer)-HPr complex. However, RDCs recorded on a sample of labeled HPr in the presence of excess IIAMan will arise not from a single species but from a mixture of two species with a stoichiometry of 1:1 and 1:2 IIAMan(dimer) to HPr (i.e. one and two HPr binding sites on IIAMan occupied, respectively). The alignment tensors for these two species will necessarily be different and impossible to deconvolute. We therefore recorded RDCs for HPr on a sample comprising labeled HPr in excess over unlabeled IIAMan (with a ratio of 3:1 HPr to IIAMan subunits). Under these conditions, the measured RDCs correspond to a weighted average of the RDCs for two species: free HPr and HPr in the 1:2 IIAMan(dimer)-HPr complex (i.e. both HPr sites on IIAMan occupied). The RDCs for the latter can then be readily back-calculated from the experimental data using accurate RDCs measured on free HPr in the same liquid crystalline medium using the relationship, RDCbound,iHPr=(RDCobs,iHPr−ffreeHPrRDCfree,iHPr)/(1−ffreeHPr)(Eq. 1) where ffreeHpr is the fraction of free HPr in the sample, RDCfree,iHPr are the RDCs measured for free HPr, RDCobs,iHPr are the RDCs measured on the sample comprising a 3:1 excess of labeled HPr over IIAMan subunits, and RDCbound,iHPr are the back-calculated RDCs for HPr in a pure 1:2 IIAMan(dimer)-HPr complex. (The value of ffreeHPr can be determined accurately from the observed 1HN/15N chemical shift perturbations in the sample because the 1HN and 15N chemical shifts are known in the free and ful"

DNA microarray analysis revealed that HSP70 expression underwent the greatest fold activation of 12,532 transcripts examined in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) transduced with constitutively active Akt1. Akt1 gene transfer increased HSP70 transcript expression by 24.8-fold as determined by quantitative PCR and promoted a dose-dependent up-regulation of HSP70 protein as determined by Western immunoblot analysis. Gene transfer of FOXO3a, a downstream target of Akt in endothelial cells, significantly suppressed both basal and stress-induced HSP70 protein expression. FOXO3a induced caspase-9-dependent apoptosis in HUVEC, and cotransduction with Ad-HSP70 rescued endothelial cells from FOXO3a-induced apoptosis under basal and stress conditions. Our results identify HSP70 as a new antiapoptotic target of Akt-FOXO3a signaling in endothelial cells that controls viability through modulation of the stress-induced intrinsic cell death pathway."

This requires proton motive force and an integral inner membrane complex, TonB-ExbB-ExbD. Recognition of iron-free siderophores by TonB-dependent outer membrane transporters (OMT) has only been described for a subfamily called OMTN. These OMTNs have an additional domain at the N terminus, which interacts with an inner membrane regulatory protein to activate a cytoplasmic σ factor. This induces transcription of iron transport genes. Here we showed that the ability to bind aposiderophores is not specific to the OMTN subfamily but may be a more general feature of OMTs. FhuA, the ferrichrome OMT in Escherichia coli, and FptA, the pyochelin (Pch) OMT in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were both able to bind in vitro and in vivo the apo-forms and the ferric forms of their corresponding siderophore at a common binding site. FptA produced in P. aeruginosa cells grown in an iron-deficient medium copurifies with a ligand that, as characterized by fluorescence, is iron-free Pch. As described previously for the FpvA transporter (pyoverdine OMT in P. aeruginosa), it appears that in conditions of iron limitation all the FptA receptors at the cell surface are loaded with apoPch. This FptA-Pch complex is less stable in vitro than the previously described copurified FpvA-Pvd complex and can be loaded with iron in vitro in the presence of Pch-Fe, citrate-Fe, or ferrichrome-Fe.

These findings improved our understanding of the iron uptake mechanism via siderophores in Gram-negative bacteria. When grown in iron-deficient conditions, many bacteria synthesize and release iron chelators, termed siderophores (1Xiao R. Kisaalita W.S. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2509-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 2Winkelmann G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 3Boukhalfa H.

Siderophores make iron available for use by the cells by solubilizing ferric ion, which otherwise forms insoluble complexes, under aerobic conditions at physiological pH. In the host, siderophores from infectious or parasitic bacteria are thought to sequester iron from iron-containing molecules such as transferrin and lactoferrin and then to deliver it to the microbial cells. Ferric uptake mediated by siderophores in Gram-negative bacteria involves a specific outer membrane transporter (OMT) 1The abbreviations used are: OMT, outer membrane transporter; Pch, pyochelin; Pvd, pyoverdine; OMTN, a subfamily of outer membrane transporters; MEM, maximum entropy method; pmf, proton motive force; octyl-POE, n-octylpolyoxyethylene. 1The abbreviations used are: OMT, outer membrane transporter; Pch, pyochelin; Pvd, pyoverdine; OMTN, a subfamily of outer membrane transporters; MEM, maximum entropy method; pmf, proton motive force; octyl-POE, n-octylpolyoxyethylene. and an inner membrane ABC transporter (4Braun V.

The energy required for transport across the inner membrane is provided by ATP hydrolysis. Transport across the outer membrane by the OMT is driven by the proton motive force of the inner membrane via an inner membrane complex composed of TonB, ExbB, and ExbD (6Moeck G.S. Coulton J.W. Mol.

The ferric-siderophore-binding site is located above the cork, well outside the membrane. It is composed of residues of the plug and of the β-barrel domains. The electrostatic properties of the siderophore-binding pocket are specific to each OMT and are related to the chemical features of the siderophore. The binding pocket of iron-free Pvd on FpvA is mainly composed of aromatic residues (14Cobessi D. Célia H. Folschweiller N. Schalk I.J. Abdallah M.A. Pattus F. J. Mol.

The ferric-citrate-binding pocket of FecA is composed of 5 Arg residues, which interact with the negatively charged ferric-citrate (11Ferguson A.D. Chakraborty R. Smith B.S. Esser L. van der Helm D.

Microbiol. 2004; 54: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These transporters have an additional domain of about 70 amino acids at the N terminus, absent from all other OMTs (15Schalk I.J. Yue W.W. Buchanan S.K. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 17: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This region is localized in the periplasm and is involved in the regulation of the transcription of the genes governing iron uptake by the bacteria (17Braun V. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18Braun V. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2001; 291: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 19Visca P. Leoni L. Wilson M.J. Lamont I.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1177-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In addition, some OMTNs bind the iron-free and the iron-loaded form of their corresponding siderophore, with close affinities, to a common or overlapping binding site (15Schalk I.J. Yue W.W. Buchanan S.K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This has been described for the pyoverdine (Pvd) outer membrane receptor FpvA of P. aeruginosa (20Schalk I.J.

Abdallah M.A. Pattus F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the ferric-citrate outer membrane receptor FecA of E. coli (12Yue W.W. Grizot S. Buchanan S.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and the hemophore outer membrane receptor HasR of Serratia marcescens (22Letoffe S. Deniau C. Wolff N. Dassa E. Delepelaire P. Lecroisey A. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of FecA, loaded with apo-citrate or ferric-citrate, have shown that it binds its apo- and ferric-siderophore, dicitrate, and diferric-dicitrate at a common binding site, but the interactions are completely different (12Yue W.W. Grizot S. Buchanan S.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the FecA-citrate-Fe complex, the two citrate ions are in a planar orientation, whereas in the FecA-citrate complex the two iron-free citrate ions are orthogonal. Only the binding of the diferric dicitrate to FecA is accompanied by significant conformational changes in two extracellular loops L7 and L8; these changes close the binding pocket, thereby sequestering the ligand in the binding site (12Yue W.W. Grizot S. Buchanan S.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). When iron-free dicitrate binds to FecA, no binding pocket closure is observed, and the iron-free dicitrate remains accessible to the extracellular medium. For the FpvA transporter, only the structure of the FpvA-Pvd complex is known (14Cobessi D. Célia H. Folschweiller N. Schalk I.J. Abdallah M.A. Pattus F. J. Mol. Biol.,. 2005; 347: 79-83Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, the interactions between FpvA and each apo- and ferric-Pvd have been studied using the fluorescent properties of the siderophore. Consequently, a mechanism for the iron uptake cycle has been proposed (for a review see Refs. 15Schalk I.J. Yue W.W. Buchanan S.K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar and 23Schalk I.J. Ramos J.L. Levesque R. Pseudomonas: Molecular Biology of Emerging Issues. 4. Kluwer Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2005Google Scholar). Under iron limitation all FpvA receptors at the cell surface are loaded with iron-free Pvd (20Schalk I.J. Kyslik P. Prome D. van Dorsselaer A. Poole K. Abdallah M.A. Pattus F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9357-9365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Schalk I.J. Hennard C. Dugave C. Poole K. Abdallah M.A. Pattus F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This FpvA-Pvd complex is extremely stable and dissociates in vivo following activation of the transporter by the pmf via the TonB machinery (24Clément E. Mesini P.J. Pattus F. Abdallah M.A. Schalk I.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7954-7965Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Ferric-Pvd then binds to the transporter. Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy studies show that Pvd is less mobile in its binding site and less solvent-accessible in the FpvA-Pvd-metal complex than in the FpvA-Pvd complex (25Folschweiller N. Gallay J. Vincent M. Abdallah M.A. Pattus F. Schalk I.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14591-14601Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Possibly, extracellular loops form a lid and trap the Pvd metal in its binding site as observed in FecA-Cit-Fe. The heme uptake cycle of HasR, the hemophore receptor in S. marcescens, shares common features with FpvA as follows: (i) binding of the holo- and apo-hemophore with high affinities to a common binding site on HasR (22Letoffe S. Deniau C. Wolff N. Dassa E. Delepelaire P. Lecroisey A. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and (ii) activation of the release of the apo-hemophore from HasR by the pmf via the TonB machinery (26Letoffe S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4067-4074Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is not known if the binding of iron-free siderophores to their corresponding OMT is a specific feature of the OMTN subfamily or if it is common to all OMTs. We investigated the binding properties of two transporters, which do not belong to the OMTN subfamily: FhuA, the ferrichrome OMT in E. coli, and FptA, the pyochelin (Pch) OMT in P. aeruginosa. FhuA is a typical example of iron uptake systems (4Braun V. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: 1409-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), but its ability to bind the apo-form of ferrichrome has not been rigorously described. The FptA/Pch system is one of the major iron uptake pathways in P. aeruginosa (27Ankenbauer R.G. Quan H.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 307-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Cox C.D. Rinehart Jr., K.L. Moore M.L. Cook Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4256-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), but its mechanism has never been investigated at the molecular level. We report that these two receptors bind with close affinities and to a single binding site the apo- and ferric forms of their corresponding siderophores. Like FpvA, the normal state of FptA in the outer membranes of P. aeruginosa, under iron limitation conditions, seems to be the FptA-Pch complex. This in vitro complex is less stable than the FpvA-Pvd complex described previously. Finally, the mechanism of formation of iron-loaded FptA-Pch in vitro seems to be more efficient than that for the FpvA/Pvd system.

P. aeruginosa strain K691 is an FpvA-deficient mutant and has been described previously (20Schalk I.J. Kyslik P. Prome D. van Dorsselaer A. Poole K. Abdallah M.A. Pattus F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9357-9365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The Pvd-deficient P. aeruginosa strain, CDC5, was described by Ankenbauer et al. (32Ankenbauer R. Hanne L.F. Cox C.D. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 7-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation has been mapped to the pvd locus that contains genes involved in the synthesis of the peptide moiety of Pvd. FpvA was overproduced in K691 and CDC5 strains by introduction of a plasmid, pPVR2, carrying the fpvA gene (33Poole K. Neshat S. Krebes K. Heinrichs D.E. J.

The Pch- and Pvd-deficient P. aeruginosa strain, PAD07, and the strain overexpressing FhuA, HO830(pHX405), have been described previously (34Takase H. Nitanai H. Hoshino K. Otani T. Infect.

HO830 (pHX405) was grown in LB medium (Luria-Bertani broth) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.1 mm 2,2′-dipyridyl. Preparation of Outer Membranes and Purification of FpvA, FptA, and FhuA—Outer membranes and purified FpvA receptors were prepared as described previously (20Schalk I.J. Kyslik P. Prome D. van Dorsselaer A. Poole K. Abdallah M.A. Pattus F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9357-9365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). FptA was purified with the same protocol as FpvA from the Pvd-deficient strain CDC5(pPVR2). Contaminant FpvA was separated from FptA by chromatofocusing. FhuA was purified as described previously (35Moeck G.S. Letellier L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2755-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence intensity and anisotropy decays were obtained from the polarized components Ivv(t) and Ivh(t) by the time-correlated single photon-counting technique. A LDH370 diode laser from Picoquant GmbH (Berlin-Adlershof, Germany) was used at a repetition rate of 10 MHz for excitation at 370 nm. Fluorescence emission was selected by a single monochromator (Jobin Yvon UV-H10, bandwidth 8 nm). A MCP-PMT Hamamatsu detector (model R3809U-02) was used. The instrument response function (∼160 ps) was monitored with the reference compound decay of 4-dimethylamino-4′-cyanostilbene (τ = 41 ps in cyclohexane). Time resolution was ∼ 20 ps, and the data were stored in 2048 channels. Fluorescence intensity and anisotropy decays were fitted to multiexponential functions by the maximum entropy method (MEM) (36Livesey A.K. Brochon J.C. Biophys.

All other fluorescence experiments were performed with a Photon Technology International TimeMaster™ (Bioritech) spectrofluorometer. For all experiments the sample was stirred at 29 °C in a 1-ml cuvette. Formation of Iron-loaded FptA-Pch Complex and Binding of Pch to FptA—Outer membranes prepared from CDC5(pPVR2) cells, at concentration between 3.5 and 1.3 mg/ml, were incubated overnight in the presence of 20 μm Pch2-Fe, in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. According to the fluorescence emission spectrum of the outer membranes, the concentration of FptA-Pch in the experiment was ∼20 μm. The same experiment was repeated in the absence of ferric-siderophore and also in the presence of Pvd-Fe, Pch2-Fe or ferrichrome-Fe. After incubation, the membranes were pelleted at 20,000 × g, washed with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, to eliminate the unbound siderophore-Fe, and resuspended in 1 ml of the same Tris-HCl buffer at a concentration of 700 μg/ml for each of the conditions presented in Fig. 5A and 250 μg/ml for the experiments in Fig. 8. An emission scan was recorded for each experiment with the excitation wavelength set at 315 nm.Fig. 8A, formation of iron-loaded FptA-Pch in vitro. Experiment followed by fluorescence. Outer membranes prepared from CDC5(pPVR2) cells were incubated with 20 μm Pch2-Fe (•), Pvd-Fe (thin solid line), or ferrichrome-Fe (dashed line) for 24 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After incubation, the membranes were pelleted and resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer at 250 μg/ml, and the emission fluorescence spectrum was monitored.

B, competition for iron between Pch and ferrichrome-Fe. 1 eq of Pch was incubated with 1 eq of ferrichrome at 30 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. An emission fluorescence spectrum was obtained before addition of ferrichrome-Fe (solid line) and one after 30 min of incubation (dashed line). No additional decrease of fluorescence was observed after longer incubation times. Since Pvd was fluorescent at 450 nm as was Pch, the experiment could not be carried out with this siderophore.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the binding of Pch to FptA in vitro, outer membranes prepared from PAD07 cells at a concentration of 1 mg/ml were incubated overnight in the presence of 200 μm Pch in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The excess Pch was then eliminated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g as described above, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and an emission scan was monitored (excitation wavelength set at 315 nm). Ligand Binding Assays Using 55Fe—To determine the apparent dissociation constants in vivo of Pvd-55Fe, Pch-55Fe, and ferrichrome-55Fe binding to their corresponding receptors, CDC5(pPVR2), PAD07, and HO830(pHX405), cells were washed twice with an equal volume of fresh medium and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, at an A600 of 0.05 for CDC5(pPVR2) and of 0.3 for PAD07 and HO830(pHX405). The cells were then incubated at 0 °C to avoid any iron uptake (24Clément E. Mesini P.J. Pattus F. Abdallah M.A. Schalk I.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7954-7965Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) for 1 h in a final volume of 500 μl in the presence of various concentrations (0.1 to 80 nm) of siderophore-55Fe. Incubations were stopped by centrifugation at 12,000 × g (4 °C) for 2 min. The supernatant containing the unbound siderophore-55Fe was removed, and the tubes containing the cell pellet were counted for radioactivity in a scintillation mixture. The experiments were repeated in the absence of cells to estimate nonspecific interactions of siderophore-55Fe with the tubes. For competition experiments, purified receptor (FpvA, FhuA, or FptA) at a concentration of 0.1 nm and in a final volume of 500 μl was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with siderophore-55Fe (0.5 nm) and various concentrations of unlabeled siderophore loaded or not loaded with iron (0–1000 nm). Incubations were stopped by filtering the assay mixtures over GF/B filters (Whatman, presoaked in 0.1% polyethyleneimine). The filters were then rapidly washed three times with 3 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and counted for radioactivity in a scintillation mixture. Apparent binding affinity constants (Ki) of siderophores were calculated from IC50 values, determined in competition experiments, according to the Cheng and Prusoff relation (38Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12222) Google Scholar): Ki = IC50/(1 + L/Kd), where L is the concentration of radiolabeled ligand, and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant determined experimentally. The experiment was repeated in vivo with the cells prepared at an A600 of 0.3 for PAO1 15692 and PAD07, and 0.05 for CDC5(pPVR2) and HO830(pHX405). The experiment was also repeated in the absence of cells to estimate nonspecific interaction of siderophore-55Fe with the filter. A second method was also used for the in vivo competition experiments. Cells were incubated in the presence of the siderophore as described above. However, the unbound siderophore (labeled or not labeled) was separated from the cells in a different way; the mixtures were centrifuged at 12,000 × g (4 °C) for 2 min, and the supernatant was removed. The tubes containing the cell pellet were counted for radioactivity in a scintillation mixture. To form the 55Fe-loaded FptA-Pch complex, purified FptA-Pch (100 nm) from strain CDC5(pPVR2) was incubated with 100 nm Pch-55Fe in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% octyl-POE at room temperature for 24 h. Incubation was stopped by filtering the assay mixture over GF/B filters (Whatman, presoaked in 0.1% polyethyleneimine). The filters were then rapidly washed three times with 3 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and counted for radioactivity in a scintillation mixture. The experiment was repeated with Pvd-55Fe, ferrichrome-55Fe, and citrate-55Fe and for each siderophore in the absence of FptA. FptA Copurifies with Iron-free Pch—FptA was purified in parallel with FpvA from P. aeruginosa strain CDC5(pPVR2) (Table I), using the protocol described previously for FpvA (20Schalk I.J. Kyslik P. Prome D. van Dorsselaer A. Poole K. Abdallah M.A. Pattus F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9357-9365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). FptA was subsequently separated from FpvA by chromatofocusing. N-terminal sequencing clearly showed that the purified protein was FptA with no contamination by FpvA. Purified FptA (17 μm) was excited at the absorption maximum of iron-free Pch (315 nm, Fig. 1). The emission peak was at 450 nm (Fig. 1, dotted line), showing that FptA was copurified with a fluorescent molecule (FptA-X). Previous studies have shown that the FpvA transporter of P. aeruginosa copurifies with its corresponding iron-free siderophore, Pvd, when expressed in a Pvd-producing strain (20Schalk I.J. Kyslik P. Prome D. van Dorsselaer A. Poole K. Abdallah M.A. Pattus F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9357-9365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Unlike FpvA-Pvd, the molecule co-purifying with FptA-X could not be easily identified because of the small amounts of purified receptor available. Pch is a fluorescent siderophore (Fig. 1), and therefore like for FpvA, FptA may copurify with apoPch. Pch is a 2-[2-(o-hydroxyphenyl)-2-thiazolin-4-yl]-3-methyl-4-thiazolidinecarboxylic acid; it has a low affinity for Fe(III) (2 × 105 m–1 in ethanol), binds the cation in a 2:1 (Pch:Fe(III)) stoichiometry ratio, and is poorly water-soluble (28Cox C.D. Rinehart Jr., K.L. Moore M.L. Cook Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4256-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Pch2-Fe is not fluorescent (Fig. 1). As in the Pvd-Fe complex, iron quenches the fluorescence of the siderophore. The photophysical properties of Pch are complex and extremely sensitive to pH (39Namiranian S. Richardson D.J. Russell D.A. Sodeau J.R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 65: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It undergoes an excited state reaction, favored at basic pH, leading to ionization of the Pch phenolic group and producing a highly fluorescent phenolate ion. The phenolate displays absorption and excitation features, different from those of the protonated phenol form. The phenolate ion exhibits a new band at 350–360 nm, not observed with the phenol form. To characterize the fluorescent ligand copurified with FptA, it was therefore necessary to study in more detail the fluorescence properties of FptA-X with respect to Pch. The fluorescence emission spectrum of free Pch in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, diffe"
https://openalex.org/W2050185766,"The collagen triple helix is characterized by the repeating sequence motif Gly-Xaa-Yaa, where Xaa and Yaa are typically proline and (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4(R)Hyp), respectively. Previous analyses have revealed that H-(Pro-4(R)Hyp-Gly)10-OH forms a stable triple helix, whereas H-(4(R)Hyp-Pro-Gly)10-OH does not. Several theories have been put forth to explain the importance of proline puckering and conformation in triple helix formation; however, the details of how they affect triple helix stability are unknown. Underscoring this, we recently demonstrated that the polypeptide Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 forms a triple helix that is more stable than Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2. Here we report crystal the structure of the H-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)9-OH peptide at 1.55 Å resolution. The puckering of the Yaa position 4(R)Hyp in this structure is up (Cγ exo), as has been found in other collagen peptide structures. Notably, however, the 4(R)Hyp in the Xaa position also takes the up pucker, which is distinct from all other collagen structures. Regardless of the notable difference in the Xaa proline puckering, our structure still adopts a 7/2 superhelical symmetry similar to that observed in other collagen structures. Thus, the basis for the observed differences in the thermodynamic data of the triple helix↔ coil transition between our peptide and other triple helical peptides likely results from contributions from the unfolded state. Indeed, the unfolded state of the H-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)9-OH peptide seems to be stabilized by a preformed polyproline II helix in each strand, which could be explained by the presence of a unique repeating intra-strand water-mediated bridge observed in the H-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)9-OH structure, as well as a higher amount of trans peptide bonds.

Collagen is the most abundant protein as well as the major structural protein in animals. Twenty-seven types of collagens and more than 15 proteins that adopt a collagen-like structure, such as collectins, ficolins, and scavenger receptors, occur in humans (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Collagen has a very characteristic amino acid sequence in which a glycine residue appears every third position, forming the triplet repeat Gly-Xaa-Yaa. Collagen also has a high imino acid content (∼20%) and typically contains proline and (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4(R)Hyp) 1The abbreviations used are: 4(R)Hyp, (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline; 4(S)Hyp, (2S,4S)-4-hydroxyproline; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HATU, O-(7-azabenzotriazole-1-yl)-1.1.3.3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate; ASU, asymmetric unit. in the Xaa and Yaa positions, respectively. These characteristic sequence constraints lead to the formation of a very unique triple helical structure. Specifically, each of the three polypeptide chains forms a polyproline II-like left-handed structure, and these structures twist around each other to form a loose right-handed superhelix. A glycine residue is required every third residue because the compact triple helix places every third residue near the superhelical central axis. Proline residues, in the Xaa and Yaa positions, place additional restraints on the collagen structure important for triple helix formation. In addition, one of the characteristics of collagen is the ratio of posttranslationally modified prolines. For example, in vertebrates, prolines in the Yaa position are found to be almost completely modified to 4(R)Hyp. The enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is prolyl 4-hydroxylases (EC 1.14.11.2) (2Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 3Kivirikko K.I. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 355-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Prolines are typically found in the Xaa position, although some are partially modified to (2S,3S)-3-hydroxyproline. In invertebrates, more complex posttranslational modifications occur in collagens. For instance, in annelid cuticle collagen, 4(R)Hyp residues are found in both the Xaa and Yaa positions, and galactosylated threonine residues are also observed in the Yaa position (4Gaill F. Mann K. Wiedemann H. Engel J. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 5Mann K. Mechling D.E. Bächinger H.P. Eckerskorn C. Gaill F. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The variety of posttranslational modifications observed in collagen may function in the regulation of the supramolecular assembly of collagen and its affinity for other molecules. Vast amounts of data have been obtained on the collagen structure and stability using polypeptides as model systems (6Fields G.B. Prockop D.J.

These structures, when combined with stability studies, have provided a detailed view of amino acid propensities for the collagen triple helix. Importantly, thermal stability studies have revealed that the content of 4(R)Hyp in the Yaa position is related to the melting temperature (Tm) of collagens (18Burjanadze T.V. Veis A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1997; 36: 347-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 1-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar), and the Tm of dispersed collagen molecules at very low concentration is a few degrees lower than the body temperature of the species from which the collagen was isolated (20Leikina E. Mertts M.V. Kuznetsova N. Leikin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1314-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Thermal stability studies have demonstrated that whereas H-(Pro-Pro-Gly)10-OH and H-(Pro-4(R)Hyp-Gly)10-OH form stable triple helices in aqueous solution, H-(4(R)Hyp-Pro-Gly)10-OH, H-(4(S)Hyp-Pro-Gly)10-OH, and H-(Pro-4(S)Hyp-Gly-)10-OH do not (21Inouye K. Sakakibara S. Prockop D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 420: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22Inouye K. Kobayashi Y. Kyogoku Y. Kishida Y. Sakakibara S. Prockop D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 219: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, these studies clearly suggest that proline conformation and modification play a decisive role in the collagen structure and stability. To address these issues, recent quantum mechanical ab initio calculations have been carried out to elucidate the specific roles of stereoelectronic effects, ring pucker, cis/trans stabilization, and ϕ/ψ dihedral angles in proline and hydroxyproline residues and the effect of these parameters on the formation of the collagen triple helix (23Improta R. Mele F. Crescenzi O. Benzi C. Barone V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7857-7865Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 24DeRider M.L. Wilkens S.J. Waddell M.J. Bretscher L.E. Weinhold F.

These studies determined that electronegative 4(S) and 4(R) substituents on proline residues favor down ring and up ring puckering, respectively. In addition, the up-puckering conformation (e.g. in 4(R)Hyp) favors smaller values of backbone ϕ/ψ dihedral angles compared with down puckering (e.g. Pro), which can adopt a larger range of backbone ϕ/ψ dihedral angles. 4(R)Hyp residues also favor the trans peptide conformation because electron-withdrawing substituents on the 4 position of proline alter the pyramidylization of the bond, increasing the sp3 character of the prolyl nitrogen atom, which thereby alters the rate of prolyl peptide bond isomerization. The presence of the hydroxyl in 4(R)Hyp in the Yaa position strongly stabilizes the collagen structure, and this is thought to be attributed not to water bridges but to inductive effects (27Panasik Jr., N. Eberhardt E.S. Edison A.S. Powell D.R. Raines R.T. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1994; 44: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 28Holmgren S.K. Taylor K.M. Bretscher L.E. Raines R.T. Nature. 1998; 392: 666-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). When combined with recent high-resolution structural data, these studies suggest that collagen stability is linked to the interplay between the pyrrolidine ring pucker, ϕ/ψ dihedral angles, and the cis/trans conformation. Importantly, these data indicate that down pucker is preferred in the Xaa positions and that up pucker is preferred in the Yaa positions. Up-puckered residues favor smaller values of ϕ/ψ dihedral angles in contrast to down-puckered prolines, and the trans conformation is favored by the presence of a electron-withdrawing substituent on the 4 position of proline (23Improta R.

Interestingly, despite these studies, we have found that the existence of 4(R)Hyp, which strongly favors the up-puckered conformation, in the Xaa position does not prevent the formation of a triple helix. Specifically, we have demonstrated that when the Yaa position is not Pro, acetyl-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-Yaa)10-NH2 peptides form a stable triple helix (29Bann J.G. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol.

Peptides with threonine and valine in the Yaa position form a very stable triple helix in water, and peptides with threonine, valine, allo-threonine, alanine, and serine in the Yaa position form a triple helix in propanediol (31Mizuno K.

However, more remarkably, we recently found that the peptide Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2, which has a 4(R)Hyp in both the Xaa and Yaa positions, forms a stable triple helix, whereas Ac-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 does not (30Mizuno K.

Calorimetric studies have shown that the transition enthalpy of the trimer of the peptide Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 is significantly smaller than that of Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 (30Mizuno K. Hayashi T. Peyton D.H. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38072-38078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The amide proton exchange experiment suggested that the triple helical structure of Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 appears to fluctuate more than that of the Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 peptide (30Mizuno K.

These studies showed distinct thermodynamics of folding for the Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 peptide compared with the Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 peptide that indicated that these two peptides might have distinct unfolded states (30Mizuno K.

The current high-resolution structures of triple helical peptides have shown that the conformation of proline in the Xaa position is Cγ endo (puckering down) and that of the proline (or 4(R)Hyp) in the Yaa position is Cγ exo (puckering up) (10Okuyama K.

This positional preference of proline puckering is generally true, but in some peptides exceptions occur in a limited number of residues (10Okuyama K. Hongo C. Fukushima R. Wu G. Narita H. Noguchi K. Tanaka Y. Nishino N. Biopolymers. 2004; 76: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Kramer R.Z. Venugopal M.G. Bella J. Mayville P. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. J. Mol.

Bella J. Mayville P. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the interaction with neighboring triple helices may affect proline puckering (10Okuyama K. Hongo C. Fukushima R. Wu G. Narita H. Noguchi K. Tanaka Y. Nishino N. Biopolymers. 2004; 76: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Also, each polypeptide forms a 7/1 helical structure with seven tripeptide units. The puckering of imino acids in H-(Pro-4(R)Hyp-Gly)10-OH was also measured by two-dimensional NMR in D2O at 10 °C. In this NMR study, the Xaa position Pro was also found to be Cγ endo (puckering down), and the Pro (Hyp) in the Yaa position was Cγ exo (puckering up) (35Li M.H. Fan P. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7377-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because these studies clearly show a strong preference for down and up pucker in the Xaa and Yaa positions, we were interested in determining why Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2, which contains an up pucker preferring 4(R)Hyp in the Xaa position, can form such a stable triple helix. To determine the exact pucker of the Xaa residues in this peptide and to provide insight into how it forms such a stable triple helix and what might explain its different folding thermodynamics, we determined the crystal structure of the peptide H-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)9-OH to 1.55 Å resolution. Surprisingly, our structure clearly reveals that the 4(R)Hyp residues in the Xaa position adopt an up pucker conformation. The ϕ/ψ dihedral angles of the Gly and Xaa residues are similar to those observed in other peptides. However, the ϕ/ψ values for the Xaa up-puckered 4(R)Hyp residues (ϕ =–70.5° and ψ = 161.3°) are slightly energetically unfavorable for the up or Cγ exo proline conformation (ϕ = –63.1° and ψ = 146.3° for 4(R)Hyp), when compared by quantum mechanical calculations (26Improta R. Benzi C. Barone V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 12568-12577Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The 4(R)Hyp residues in the Yaa positions, although up-puckered, also adopt slightly unfavorable ϕ/ψ dihedral angles (ϕ =–66.2° and ψ = 156.4°). Despite these distinctions between our structure and other collagen peptides, the overall triple helix of our peptide conforms to 7/2 superhelix symmetry. This suggests that although the slightly unfavorable ϕ/ψ dihedral angles for residues in the Xaa and Yaa positions may play a minor role in the collagen folding stability, the altered thermodynamic data for folding that we observe are most likely attributable to differences in the unfolded states of our peptide versus Gly-Pro-Pro- and Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp-containing peptides. In fact, the data indicate that the unfolded state of the H-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)9-OH peptide contains significant polyproline II structure rather than being denatured as observed for the other peptides (30Mizuno K. Hayashi T. Peyton D.H. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38072-38078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our structure reveals that this may result from the presence of a repeating intra-strand water-mediated bridge. This water links the 4(R)Hyp hydroxyl in the Xaa position and the carbonyl oxygen of the 4(R)Hyp residue in the Yaa–1 position (located one repeat NH2-terminal to the Xaa 4(R)Hyp). This novel water linkage is formed between every Yaa–1 and Xaa in the structure and appears to stabilize the polyproline II conformation. In addition, it was noted previously that the polyhydroxyproline II helix is more stable than the polyproline II helix (36Brahmachari S.K. Bansal M. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Sasisekharan V. Macromolecules. 1979; 12: 23-28Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized with an ABI 433A ynthesizer. Couplings were carried out on an ABI 433A synthesizer using H-O-t-Butyl-l-trans-4-hydroxyproline-2-chlorotrityl resin (AnaSpec, Inc., San Jose, CA) and Fmoc amino acids (Fmoc-Gly-OH and Fmoc-4(R)Hyp(tBu)-OH). HATU (Perseptive Biosystems) (4.0 eq.)/diisopropylethylamine mediated peptide couplings. The peptide was cleaved from the resin and purified by preparative high pressure liquid chromatography (Vydac® C18, 5 μm, 300 Å, 250 × 50 mm; W. R. Grace). All synthesized peptides were characterized by electrospray/quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-tof micro; Micromass) and amino acid analysis. Crystallization and Data Collection—The purified and lyophilized peptide H-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)9-OH was dissolved at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in water. The peptide was crystallized at 4 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. For crystallization, 2 μl of the peptide solution was mixed with 2 μl of the reservoir (25% of polyethylene glycol 400). Crystals with two types of morphologies, block-like and rod-like, appeared after 2 weeks. Preliminary analyses showed that only the rod-like crystals were ordered and diffracted well (to beyond 2.0 Å resolution on in-house sources). The block-like crystals diffracted to only 3.5 Å resolution, and structure determination of this crystal form was not pursued. Data collection at the synchrotron enabled us to index the full cell of the rod-like crystals as monoclinic, space group P21, with a = 23.23 Å, b = 28.58 Å, c = 80.58 Å, and β = 97.85°. For cryoprotection, glycerol was added to the drop to a final concentration of ∼50%, and crystals were flash frozen in a nitrogen cryostream. Intensity data were collected at Advanced Light Source beamline 8.2.1 at 100 K, processed with MOSFLM, and scaled with SCALA (37Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Fogel D.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Vitagliano L. Mazzarella L. Zagari A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Two solutions were obtained, which corresponds to the crystals having a Matthews coefficient of Vm of ∼1.7 Å3/Da. The two solutions placed the two triple helices in a staggered parallel arrangement. The solution was optimized by rigid body refinement (40Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Multiple cycles of simulated annealing, xyzb refinement, and rebuilding in O resulted in an Rwork/Rfree of 35%/40% to 1.78 Å resolution (40Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). After the addition of several waters, the Rwork/Rfree converged to 33%/38%. At this point, although one triple helix fit the density well, there was significant difference in density throughout the second triple helix consistent with the reverse (N to C versus C to N) orientation. After “flipping” this second tripled helix, refinement to 1.78 Å converged to an Rfree of 27.1%. At this stage additional waters were added, and refinement was carried out to the limiting value of 1.55 Å. After several rounds of refinement in CNS, the Rwork/Rfree converged to the final values of 23.5%/25.5%. Density is excellent for all residues except the ends of the triple helices, where the thermal parameters are higher. The hydroxyl moieties were observed clearly for all 4(R)Hyp residues except E4 at the very NH2 termini of one chain. Because of the poor density, this residue was modeled as a proline. 4(R)Hyp residues A7, B22, and G16 are the only 4(R)Hyp residues that adopt down puckers. The conformations of these residues are likely affected by their close approach (3.6, 3.4, and 3.7 Å) to the hydroxyl moieties of the Xaa 4(R)Hyp residues F28, E13, and D19 on the other triple helix (1YM8). The current model has excellent stereochemistry (42Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab Overall Structure of the H-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)9-OH Peptide—The structure of the H-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)9-OH peptide was determined by Molecular Replacement (see “Experimental Procedures”) and refined to an Rfree of 25.5% using all data to 1.55 Å resolution (Table I). The asymmetric unit (ASU) consists of two triple helices, each of 80 Å in length, arranged in an anti-parallel manner (Fig. 1). Each triple helix contains all 81 residues, or 27 Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp triplet repeats, arranged in three chains and 285 water molecules. The two crystallographically independent triple helices in the ASU are essentially identical as revealed by superimposition of all corresponding Cα atoms in each triple helix, which results in a root mean square deviation of 0.30 Å. The specific quasi-hexagonal packing with two anti-parallel triple helices in this structure (Fig. 2) is similar to previously determined structures (10Okuyama K. Hongo C. Fukushima R. Wu G.

As expected, the 4(R)Hyp residues in the Yaa positions all take the Cγ exo or up pucker conformation. However, unlike other collagen triple helical structures, the residues in the Xaa positions also take the Cγ exo or up pucker. Nonetheless, the (Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)9 structure adopts a superhelix 7/2 symmetry with an average helical height of 8.5 Å (compared with 8.6 Å for the idealized 7/2 helix). Thus, it appears to adopt, overall, a structure very similar to the other collagen peptide structures (9Berisio R. Vitagliano L. Mazzarella L. Zagari A.

https://openalex.org/W2111874221,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has recently been described to be constitutively activated in Bcr-Abl-transformed cells and to mediate rapamycin-induced inhibition of growth in respective cell lines. We have recently shown that rapamycin down-regulates expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a mediator of leukemia-associated angiogenesis, in primary CML cells. In the present study, we analyzed growth-inhibitory in vitro and in vivo effects of rapamycin on primary CML cells and asked whether rapamycin-induced suppression of VEGF in leukemic cells is related to growth inhibition. Rapamycin dose dependently inhibited growth of primary CML cells obtained from patients with imatinib-responsive or imatinib-resistant disease as well as growth of Bcr-Abl-transformed imatinib-resistant cell lines. Moreover, we observed potent cytoreductive effects of rapamycin in a patient with imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl+ leukemia. The growth-inhibitory effects of rapamycin on CML cells were found to be associated with G1 cell cycle arrest and with induction of apoptosis. In all cell types tested, rapamycin was found to down-regulate expression of VEGF. However, exogenously added VEGF did not counteract the rapamycin-induced decrease in proliferation. In conclusion, rapamycin inhibits growth of CML cells in vitro and in vivo and, in addition, down-regulates expression of VEGF. Both effects may contribute to the antileukemic activity of the drug in CML."
https://openalex.org/W2079154367,"The topoisomerase I inhibitor SN38 arrests cell cycle progression primarily in S or G(2) phases of the cell cycle in a p53-independent manner. The Chk1 inhibitor, 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01), overcomes both S and G(2) arrest preferentially in cells mutated for p53, driving cells through a lethal mitosis and thereby enhancing cytotoxicity. The mechanism by which p53 maintains S and G(2) arrest was investigated here. The p53 wild-type MCF10A cells were arrested in S phase by incubation with SN38 for 24 h. Subsequent incubation with UCN-01 failed to abrogate arrest. To examine the impact of p53, MCF10A cells were developed, which express the tetramerization domain of p53 to inhibit endogenous p53 function. These cells were attenuated in SN38-mediated induction of p21(WAF1), and UCN-01 induced S, but not G(2) progression. In contrast, MCF10A cells expressing short hairpin RNA to ablate p53 expression underwent both S and G(2) phase progression with UCN-01. The difference in G(2) progression was attributed to p53-mediated gene repression; the MCF10A cells expressing the tetramerization domain retained p53 protein and repressed both cyclin B and Chk1, while cells ablated for p53 did not repress these proteins. Hence, inhibition of p53 activator function permits S phase abrogation, while additional inhibition of p53 repressor function is required for abrogation of G(2) arrest. These studies provide a mechanistic explanation for how this therapeutic strategy can selectively target tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2036475816,"Treatment of U937 cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces phosphorylation of tis21 and subsequent interaction of tis21 with Pin-1, resulting in the increased cell death with mitochondrial depolarization. Ser147 and Ser149 residues of tis21 were strongly phosphorylated by p-Erk1/2 and p-p38MAPK, respectively, but not by JNK. To investigate the significance of phosphorylation of the Ser147 residue, Pin-1, one of the mitotic regulators that binds to the Ser(P)/Thr(P)-Pro region, was employed. Wild type tis21 phosphorylated by p-Erk1/2 clearly increased its binding to Pin-1, but not the P148A mutant, indicating that Pin-1 was bound to the Ser(P)147-Pro148 region of tis21. Transfection of tis21 significantly enhanced EGF-induced Pin-1 diffusion to cytoplasm, compared with that in the vector-transfected cells. Knockdown of tis21 expression by using shRNAi significantly inhibited EGF-induced Pin-1 diffusion, and analysis by flow cytometry after JC-1 stain and confocal microscope revealed that EGF aggravated tis21-induced mitochondrial depolarization and cell death. Furthermore, tis21 was bound to cyclin B1 and Cdc2 and inhibited its activity in vivo and in vitro. In summary, treatment of U937 cells with EGF activates Erk1/2, which in turn phosphorylates Ser147 of tis21 and induces tis21 and Pin-1 binding and mitochondrial depolarization. These data suggest, for the first time, a mechanism of how EGF can be antiproliferative in human tumor cells: binding of tis21/BTG2/pc3 to Pin-1 or cyclin B1-Cdc2 complex and induction of mitochondrial depolarization.

BTG2 has been cloned from chromosomal segment 1q32 and contains a wild type p53 response element in the 5′-flanking region (–74 to –122) (6Duriez C. Falette N. Audoynaud C. Moyret-Lalle C. Bensaad K. Courtois S. Wang Q. Soussi T. Puisieux A. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 282: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), thus confirming the observation that BTG2 expression is dependent on wild type p53 function (5Rouault J.P. Falette N. Guehenneux F. Guillot C. Rimokh R. Wang Q. Berthet C. Moyret-Lalle C. Savatier P. Pain B. Shaw P. Berger R. Samarut J. Magaud J.P. Ozturk M. Samarut C. Puisieux A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). TIS21/BTG2/Pc3 belongs to the APRO (antiproliferative) protein family (7Matsuda S. Rouault J. Magaud J. Berthet C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 497: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), which contains the APRO homology domain: Box-A (Tyr49–Asn71) and Box-B (Leu96–Glu115). Overexpression of pc3 inhibits G1-S progression through transcriptional regulation of cyclin D1 in the presence of pRB (8Guardavaccaro D. Corrente G. Covone F. Micheli L. D'Agnano I. Starace G. Caruso M. Tirone F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1797-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), whereas tis21 down-regulates expressions of cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 in the absence of pRB function (9Lim I.K. Lee M.S. Ryu M.S. Park T.J. Fujiki H. Eguchi H. Paik W.K. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 23: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It has been known that tis21/BTG2/pc3 interacts with transcription factor caf1 (10Rouault J.P. Prévôt D. Berthet C. Birot A.M. Billaud M. Magaud J.P. Corbo L. J. Biol.

Interestingly, tis21 is a substrate of PRMT1, suggesting the existence of a feedback regulatory pathway between the two genes (13Lim I.K. Park T.J. Kim S. Lee H.W. Paik W.K. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 45: 871-878PubMed Google Scholar). According to the published sequences of tis21, there is only one serine residue (147SPSK150) that can potentially be phosphorylated by proline-directed kinases such as Erk1/2, p38MAPK, JNK, and Cdc2 (cell division cycle 2 kinase) (14Shah O.J. Ghosh S. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16433-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggesting a possibility of TIS21 as one of the PIN-1-interacting proteins. Pin-1 (protein-interacting NIMA), NIMA-interacting protein, is a nuclear peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase essential for regulation of mitosis (15Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), which contains group IV WW domain and binds to Ser(P)/Thr(P)-Pro in mitotic phospho-proteins (16Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). It has been suggested to be required for both normal mitotic progression (17Rippmann J.F. Hobbie S. Daiber C. Guilliard B. Bauer M. Birk J. Nar H. Garin-Chesa P. Rettig W.J. Schnapp A.

Recently, increasing interest has been focused on the role of Pin-1 and its binding proteins in cell cycle regulation and on the value of Pin-1 as a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer (19Wulf G. Ryo A. Liou Y.C. Lu K.P. Breast Cancer Res. 2003; 5: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), prostate carcinoma (20Ayala G. Wang D. Wulf G. Frolov A. Li R. Sowadski J. Wheeler T.M. Lu K.P.

Indeed, Pin-1 has been shown to play an important role in oncogenesis (24Ryo A. Liou Y.C. Lu K.P. Wulf G. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) through several different mechanisms, such as the expression of cyclin D1 by cooperating with Ras signaling (25Wulf G.M.

Liou Y.C. Lu K.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Pin-1 is an E2F target gene essential for the Neu/Ras-induced transformation of mammary epithelial cells (26Ryo A. Liou Y.C. Wulf G. Nakamura M. Lee S.W. Lu K.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5281-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) as well as a critical regulator of the tumor suppressor p53 and p21WAF1 in response to DNA damage (29Zacchi P. Gostissa M. Uchida T. Salvagno C. Avolio F. Volinia S. Ronai Z. Blandino G. Schneider C. Del Sal G. Nature. 2002; 419: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 30Wulf G.M. Liou Y.C. Ryo A. Lee S.W. Lu K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47976-47979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These findings strongly imply that several key regulators of G1/S and G2/M phases, such as p53, Cdc25C, Cdc2, and cyclin B1, might be the potential proteins to interact with Pin-1. However, a number of studies on the cellular consequence of Pin-1 binding to these proteins are quite limited until now. Considering the fact that half of human tumors are either p53-deleted or mutant (31Hollstein M. Rice K. Greenblatt M.S. Soussi T. Fuchs R. Sorlie T. Hovig E. Smith-Sorensen B. Montesano R. Harris C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3551-3555PubMed Google Scholar), it is not too far-fetched to suggest p53-independent regulation of the cell division cycle by the interaction of tis21/BTG2/pc3 with Pin-1 in human tumors. Contrary to the definition that tis21/BTG2/pc3 is a primary response gene induced by TPA or various growth factors (1Sukhatme V.P. Kartha S. Toback F.G. Taub R. Hoover R.G. Tsai-Morris C.H. Oncogene Res. 1987; 1: 343-355PubMed Google Scholar, 2Fletcher B.S. Lim R.W. Varnum B.C. Kujubu D.A. Koski R.A. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14511-14518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar), neither TPA nor high cell densities are able to increase BTG2 expression in the tumor cells to the level observed in normal renal tissues (32Struckmann K. Schraml P. Simon R. Elmenhorst K. Mirlacher M. Kononen J. Moch H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1632-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It should be noted that all of these counterpart normal tissues constitutively express tis21 mRNAs. The above described findings strongly support tumor suppressive function of tis21 in carcinogenic process and indicate that down-regulation of BTG2 is a pivotal event involved in cancer development. However, precise mechanisms of tumor suppression by tis21/BTG2/pc3 in primary tumors have not yet been known. We demonstrate in the present study that tis21 protein interacts with Pin-1 after phosphorylation of its Ser147 residue by p-Erk1/2, which was induced by EGF and inhibition of cyclin B1-associated Cdc2 activity. Moreover, treatment of U937 cells with EGF clearly enhanced tis21-mediated Pin-1 diffusion from nucleus to cytoplasm, confirmed by knockdown of tis21 expression with shRNAi (short hairpin RNA interference) application. Concurrently, mitochondrial depolarization and increased cell death occurred. Taken together, we have found a mechanism of how EGF can be anti-proliferative through Pin-1 binding to tis21/BTG2/pc3, resulting in increased mitochondrial depolarization. Cell Culture U937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. To activate Erk1/2 and p38MAPK, cells were treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) (10 ng/ml; Sigma) for 15 min and with sorbitol (300 μm; Sigma) for 30 min, respectively. The cells were synchronized at prometaphase by treatment with nocodazole (100 ng/ml) for 18 h. tis21 cDNA was earlier subcloned in our laboratory (26Ryo A. Liou Y.C. Wulf G. Nakamura M. Lee S.W. Lu K.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5281-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and tis21(open reading frame (ORF)) was amplified by PCR with the sense primer, 5′-ccgaattcaggatccatgagccacgggaagagaacc-3′, and the antisense primer, 5′-ggctcgaggatccctagctggagacggccatcac-3′. The PCR products were inserted into pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences) after digestion with EcoRI and XhoI. To prepare S147A, P148A and S149A tis21 mutants, several mutagenic primers were designed (Table I), and PCR was performed twice. The first PCR was tried with mutagenic primer as a forward primer and the above described antisense primer, which is complementary to 3′ region of tis21(ORF). The second PCR was done with the first PCR product (61, 58, and 55 bp, respectively) as a reverse primer and the above described sense primer of tis21(ORF). Concurrently, one more primer set was prepared to construct C-terminal deletion mutant of the tis21 gene (tis21ΔC), which contained amino acids 1–129 of the full sequence, using 5′-ccgaattcaggatccatgagccacgggaagagaacc-3′ and 5′-gggctcgagagccaccggggc-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The PCR products amplified with tis21 cDNA as a template were inserted into pGEX-4T-3 after digestion with EcoRI and XhoI. Mutant clones obtained were confirmed by automatic DNA sequence analyzer (ABI 377).Table IPreparation of TIS21 point mutants, focused on the potential Pin-1-interacting regionMutagenic primersTmSequences°CS147A mutant (a439gc → g439cc)68.95′-ggc agg agc gcc ccc tcg aag-3′P148A mutant (c442cc → g442cc)65.85′-c agg agc agc gcc tcg aag aac-3′S149A mutant (t445cg → g445cg)66.65′-gg agc agc ccc gcg aag aac tat g-3′ Open table in a new tab Expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins was induced overnight in DH5α cells with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (500 μm) at 30 °C, and the cells were resuspended in extraction buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5% Triton X-100) and disrupted by sonication. After removal of debris by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), the GST fusion proteins in the supernatant were purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The purified proteins were concentrated using Centricon 10 (Millipore Corp.). Various tis21 proteins were visualized in SDS-PAGE after further purification from the GST recombinant constructs by thrombin digestion for 4 h at 20 °C (Fig. 1A). ΔC indicates C-terminal deleted tis21 protein that has 1–129 amino acids instead of 158 (Fig. 1B). Rabbits (New Zealand White) were immunized with the synthetic peptide, keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled N terminus of tis21 (MSH-GKRTDMLPEC; 13-mer), whose sequence did not share any homology with other BTG family genes and appeared to be hydrophilic. The synthetic peptide was emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant for the first injection, and with incomplete Freund's adjuvant for three subsequent booster injections. The immune sera were purified by immobilized protein A column (Pierce) and concentrated using a Centricon 10 concentrator. For protein expression assays, 10–50 μg of cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Commercial sources of antibodies used were as follows: anti-p-Erk1/2 and anti-p-p38MAPK from Cell Signaling Technology; anti-Cdc2 and anti-α-tubulin from Oncogene. The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated with goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies, and the proteins were visualized by means of the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were solubilized with detergent lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates (750 μg) were then precleared with protein A-agarose beads (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4 °C. Endogenous p-p38MAPK, p-Erk1/2, cyclin B1-associated kinase, and Pin-1 were immunoprecipitated by incubating cell lysates at 4 °C overnight with antibodies against p-p38MAPK, p-Erk1/2, cyclin B1, and Pin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with the lysis buffer. To investigate whether tis21 can be phosphorylated and which kinase potentially phosphorylates tis21 protein, in vivo and in vitro IP kinase assays were performed using the above IP products. MAPKs and cyclin B1 immunocomplexes were washed twice with mitogen-activated protein kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and Cdc2 kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), respectively. Recombinant JNK (constitutively active forms; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was also used for in vitro kinase assay. The assays were initiated by adding substrate proteins and 5 μm [γ-32P]ATP (30 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 30 μl. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by adding 6× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by autoradiography. GST Pull-down Assay—To discern mitotic phase proteins interacting with WT TIS21, a GST pull-down assay was performed. Recombinant GST-WT TIS21, GST-TIS21ΔC, and GST proteins (25 μg) were prebound to glutathione-agarose beads and then incubated with lysates of the nocodazole-treated U937 cells (500 μg) in the Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer (300 μl) at 4 °C for 12 h. The agarose beads were vigorously washed with the lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were evaluated by immunoblot analyses using antibodies against cyclin B1 and Cdc2. Immunoprecipitated Pin-1 Pull-down Assay—Pin-1 immunoprecipitates obtained from U937 cell lysates (500 μg of protein) were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with either thrombin-cleaved WT tis21 or tis21 P148A mutant proteins (20 μg), which had previously been phosphorylated overnight with or without p-Erk1/2 immunocomplex. Pin-1-agarose beads were then washed three times with the lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were evaluated with immunoblot analyses, using polyclonal anti-tis21 antibody. To evaluate the effect of tis21 on Cdc2 activity, endogenous Cdc2 immunocomplexes were prepared from U937 cells transfected either with WT tis21, tis21ΔC, or pcDNA3 vector with anti-cyclin B1 antibody. Immunocomplexes were washed twice with kinase buffer, and the assay was initiated by adding histone H1 (5 μg) and [γ-32P]ATP (5 μm; 30 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 30 μl. The reaction was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C and then terminated by adding the sample buffer. Phosphorylation of the substrate protein was examined by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE. To further confirm in vitro the inhibition of Cdc2 activity by tis21, GST-tis21 protein (1, 5, and 25 μg) was added to the reaction mixture, and Cdc2 kinase activity was then measured by the method described above. U937 cells were stimulated with EGF (10 ng/ml) 24 h after transfection with either pcDNA3-tis21 or the vector alone and then spun down after 20, 40, 60 min and 24 h of EGF treatment. To investigate the intracellular location of Pin-1, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at ice, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and then attached on slide glass (MUTO Pure Chemical Co.) for 20 min at room temperature. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin, anti-Pin-1 antibody (1:200) was applied at 4 °C overnight, and the cells were washed 3 times with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS before treating them with donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Texas Red (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. To observe nuclei, Hoechst 33258 dye (1:100,000; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was also added to the above, and the cells were then washed three times with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Cells were observed by confocal microscope (Olympus, Japan). To knock down tis21 expression, shRNA against tis21 mRNA was prepared using the MessageMuter shRNAi production kit (Epicenter, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligomers targeting the 5′ end (named as LIK106) and middle (LIK107) of tis21 mRNA sequences including 1–21 (aagg 1atg agc cac ggg aag aga acc21 ctt gct tc ggt tct ctt ccc gtg gct cat tat agt ga) and 192–212 (aagg 192cta tcg ctg tat ccg tat caa212 ctt gct tc ttg ata cgg ata cag cga tag tat agt ga) bases of tis21(ORF), were synthesized; The boldface sequences can make hairpin loop region, and their downstream italic bases correspond to antisense of 1–21 and 192–212 of tis21 mRNA sequences. After annealing T7 promoter oligonucleotide with either of the LIK106 or LIK107 oligomers, the recessed ends were filled in by Klenow exo– polymerase and dNTP. Then in vitro transcription was performed at 42 °C for 3 h, and the transcripts were harvested through the treatments with RNase-free DNase I, phenol/chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitation, and MicroSpin™ column purification (Amersham Biosciences). In order to evaluate knock-down of tis21 expression by shRNAi application, RT-PCR analysis was performed. U937 (1 × 106/well) cells were transfected with WT tis21 in pcDNA3 (1 μg) with or without shRNAi-tis21 (8 μg) using 5 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) for 5 h in serum-free RPMI medium before serum addition. The cells were harvested 72 h after transfection, and tis21 expression was analyzed by RT-PCR using tis21 sense (5′-atgagccacgggaagag-3′) and antisense (5′-cggggcctcctcatac-3′) primers with 22 cycles of 95 to 58 to 72 °C. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression was also measured for normalizing mRNA loading control with sense (5′-ccatggagaaggctgggg-3′) and antisense (5′-caaagttgtcatggatgacc-3′) primers with 25 cycles of 95 to 58 to 72 °C. In order to investigate the effect of EGF to enhance tis21-induced cell death, changes of mitochondrial membrane potential difference were measured by employing JC-1 (5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide), based on the living cell staining in a membrane potential-dependent fashion: green fluorescence (λem = 527 nm) of JC-1 monomer and the red fluorescence (λem = 590 nm) of JC-1 aggregates (33Salvioli S. Ardizzoni A. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). U937 cells transfected with WT tis21 or its vector alone were incubated with EGF for 1 h and washed twice with PBS. The cell suspension was incubated with JC-1 (5 μg/ml) dye for 15 min at 37 °C, and green (FL-1) and red (FL-2) fluorescence was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) after washing the cells with PBS twice. p-Erk1/2 and p-p38MAPK Phosphorylate tis21 Protein but Not JNK—Since Erk1/2, JNK, and p38MAPK with Cdc2 are proline-directed kinases (34Mukhopadhyay N.K. Price D.J. Kyriakis J.M. Pelech S. Sanghera J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3325-3335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), tis21 C terminus 147SPSK150 residues were investigated as potential phosphorylation sites by these enzymes. Before carrying out the above investigation, however, highly active kinase preparations were needed. Therefore, U937 cells were stimulated with EGF (10 ng/ml) for 15 min to strongly activate Erk1/2 (Fig. 2A). With the p-Erk1/2 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2B), an in vitro kinase assay was performed, and only WT tis21 and not the S147A mutant could be detected by autoradiography (Fig. 2C), indicating that Ser147 residue in tis21 protein might be the site of phosphorylation by p-Erk1/2. Phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (Sigma) was also employed to prove activity of the added immunoprecipitates in each reaction mixture. In order to activate p38MAPK, U937 cells were stimulated with 0–500 μm sorbitol (Fig. 2D), and p-p38MAPK was immunoprecipitated from the cells after stimulation with 300 μm sorbitol (Fig. 2E). When the WT tis21, S149A, and ΔC mutant proteins were added to the in vitro kinase assay mixture, p-p38MAPK strongly phosphorylated WT tis21, but not S149A and ΔC mutant proteins, indicating that the Ser149 residue in tis21 is the most likely potential site for p-p38MAPK (Fig. 2F). To test whether JNK also phosphorylates WT tis21 protein, an in vitro JNK kinase assay was performed; however, JNK could not phosphorylate any tis21 proteins, as opposed to the strong phosphorylation of c-Jun-GST, which served as a positive control for the constitutively active JNK (data not shown). Pin-1 and Cyclin B1 Interact with tis21 Protein—Based on the observation that the Ser147 residue in WT tis21 protein can be phosphorylated by p-Erk1/2 (Fig. 2, A–C) and the Ser(P)-Pro residue can be recognized by Pin-1 protein (35Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Liou Y.C. Noel J.P. Lu K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2381-2384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the Ser147 residue of 147SPSK150 in the tis21 molecule might interact with Pin-1. To verify this probability, we performed Pin-1 immunoprecipitate pull-down assay. Only the WT tis21 protein that had previously been phosphorylated with p-Erk1/2 was bound to Pin-1 when the Pin-1-bound proteins were evaluated by immunoblot analysis with anti-tis21 antibody (Fig. 3A, lane 3). To prove the specificity of the binding between Pin-1 and tis21, the tis21 P148A mutant was also employed and phosphorylated with p-Erk1/2; however, there was no tis21 binding to Pin-1 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 3A, lane 4), thus indicating that Ser(P)147-Pro148 residues of WT tis21 represent a binding site for the Pin-1 molecule. When tis21-Cdc2 interaction was also investigated by a GST pull-down assay (Fig. 3B), not only Cdc2 but also cyclin B1 was found to bind to GST-tis21 proteins, both the WT tis21 and tsi21ΔC-(1–129) proteins, but not to GST alone. This indicates that the Ser147 residue is very specific for tis21-Pin-1 interaction but not for the tis21-cyclin B1 and tis21-Cdc2 interaction; the C terminus of tis21 was redundant for binding of tis21 protein to the cyclin B1-Cdc2 complex. Inhibition of Cdc2 Activity by tis21 in Vivo and in Vitro—To evaluate biological consequence of the interaction of tis21 with Cdc2, we measured in vivo and in vitro regulations of the Cdc2 activity by tis21. Thus, the active form of Cdc2 was prepared by cyclin B1 immunoprecipitation in U937 cells. When the cell lysates of the vector, WT tis21, and tis21ΔC transfection were immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin B1 antibody and subjected to kinase assay with [γ-32P]ATP and histone H1 (5 μg) as a substrate, histone H1 phosphorylation by Cdc2 was found to be significantly inhibited only in the WT tis21 overexpresser and not in the vector- and tis21ΔC-transfected cells (Fig. 4A). Inhibition of Cdc2 activity by tis21 was also confirmed by in vitro analysis. When GST or GST-tis21 proteins (1–25 μg) were added to the reaction mixture, cyclin B1-associated kinase activity was concentration-dependently inhibited by GST-tis21 but not by GST itself (Fig. 4B). Taken together, the C terminus of tis21 might be essential to inhibit Cdc2 kinase activity, thereby regulating G2/M phase progr"

However, how the exocyst complex is assembled and targeted to sites of secretion is unclear. Here, we have investigated the role of the exocyst component Exo84p in these processes. We have generated an array of temperature-sensitive yeast exo84 mutants. Electron microscopy and cargo protein traffic analyses of these mutants indicated that Exo84p is specifically involved in the post-Golgi stage of secretion. Using various yeast mutants, we systematically studied the localization of Exo84p and other exocyst proteins by fluorescence microscopy. We found that pre-Golgi traffic and polarized actin organization are required for Exo84p localization. However, none of the exocyst proteins controls Exo84p polarization. In addition, Sec3p is not responsible for the polarization of Exo84p or any other exocyst component to the daughter cell. On the other hand, several exocyst members, including Sec10p, Sec15p, and Exo70p, clearly require Exo84p for their polarization. Biochemical analyses of the exocyst composition indicated that the assembly of Sec10p, Sec15p, and Exo70p with the rest of the complex requires Exo84p. We propose that there are at least two distinct regulatory mechanisms for exocyst polarization, one for Sec3p and one for the other members, including Exo84p.

Exo84p plays a critical role in both the assembly of the exocyst and its targeting to sites of secretion. Polarized exocytosis is essential for cell growth and morphogenesis and has been implicated in a wide range of physiological functions such as neurotransmission and embryogenesis. Studies using different model systems and cell types have begun to reveal evolutionarily conserved mechanisms underlying polarized exocytosis (1Mostov K. Su T. ter Beest M. Nat.

This pattern of localization is in contrast to that of the yeast membrane fusion machinery, the t-SNAREs 1The abbreviations used are: SNAREs, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors; SC, synthetic complete; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.

Genetic and cell biological analyses indicate that the exocyst functions downstream of the Rab GTPase Sec4p and upstream of the SNAREs (12Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P.

The exocyst component Sec15p can associate with secretory vesicles and interact with the GTP-bound form of Sec4p (12Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Sec4p is required for the efficient assembly of the exocyst complex and the correct targeting of Sec15p to sites of active exocytosis at the plasma membrane (12Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 19Zajac A. Sun X. Zhang J. Guo W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1500-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although all of the exocyst components appear to have the same pattern of cellular localization, the dynamics and regulatory mechanisms for their bud tip localization seem to be very different (11Finger F. Hughes T. Novick P. Cell. 1998; 92: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 13Guo W. Tamanoi F. Novick P. Nat.

Hughes T. Pypaert M. Novick P. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The polarization of Sec3p is independent of the secretory pathway and actin cytoskeleton (11Finger F. Hughes T. Novick P.

It was therefore proposed that Sec3p is the exocyst component most proximal to the plasma membrane and may serve as a spatial landmark defining the sites of secretion (11Finger F. Hughes T. Novick P.

In contrast to Sec3p, several other components, including Sec8p and Sec15p, were shown to rely on polarized actin cables for their targeting to the bud tip marked by Sec3p (11Finger F. Hughes T.

To understand the role of the exocyst complex in vesicle tethering, we first need to investigate how the exocyst components are assembled and how they are targeted to the sites of secretion. Here, we characterized the exocyst component Exo84p using an array of temperature-sensitive exo84 mutants. Electron microscopy and enzyme secretion assays of these mutants indicated that Exo84p is specifically involved in the post-Golgi stage of exocytosis. Systematic analyses of the localization of Exo84p and the other members of the exocyst in various yeast mutants revealed distinctive regulatory mechanisms for the targeting of individual exocyst components to sites of secretion. Combining the results from fluorescence imaging and biochemical analyses, we conclude that Exo84p plays a critical role in both the assembly of the exocyst and the targeting of this complex to specific sites of the plasma membrane for exocytosis.

The resulting plasmid is pRS315-Exo84 (CEN, LEU2). Plasmid pRS315-HIS3, containing the original promoter and terminator of EXO84 but with the EXO84 open reading frame sequence replaced by HIS3, was used for disruption of the EXO84 gene from the yeast chromosome. To generate exo84 mutants, mutagenesis was performed by “error-prone” PCR using pRS315-Exo84 as a template (25Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Applications. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). The PCR products containing random mutations in the EXO84 gene were mixed with equal amounts of pRS315-PTExo84 linearized at the promoter-terminator junction. This mixture of DNA was used transformation into the yeast strain GY1264 (exo84Δ::HIS3, p416TEF-Exo84, CEN, URA) to allow homologous recombination between the PCR products and the linearized plasmid. Transformants were selected on Leu/His-deficient synthetic complete (SC) medium plates at 25 °C and then replicated onto Leu/His-deficient SC medium plates containing 1 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid (Zymo Research Corp.) to select for yeast cells that lost the balancer plasmid p416TEF-Exo84. The selected colonies were replicated onto two sets of Leu/His-deficient SC medium plates and incubated at 25 and 37 °C, respectively, for identification of mutants that could not survive at 37 °C. Candidate mutants were confirmed by retransformation of isolated plasmids containing mutant exo84 back into the host strain. For exo84-112 and exo84-121, we integrated the mutant DNA into the EXO84 locus in the chromosome. Briefly, plasmids containing the open reading frames of exo84-112 and exo84-121 flanked by the EXO84 promoter and terminator were constructed, and the sequences containing the exo84 mutants were isolated by enzymatic digestion. These linearized DNA fragments were integrated into a yeast strain (GY1264) in which the EXO84 locus was disrupted by HIS3 and supplemented by a URA3 CEN EXO84 plasmid. Transformants were replicated onto SC medium plates containing 1 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid to select for the loss of the CEN URA3 EXO84 plasmid. The correctly integrated transformants from surviving colonies were identified by PCR and further confirmed by retesting their temperature sensitivity. Invertase Assays—Measurement of internal and external invertase activities was performed on wild-type and exo84 mutant cells as described previously (26Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Cells were grown overnight at 25 °C in yeast extract peptone glucose medium to early log phase, and 4.0 A600 units of cells were collected. For each sample, 1 unit of cells was immediately pelleted, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 10 mm NaN3, and stored on ice as a 0-min control. The remaining samples were incubated in yeast extract peptone plus 0.1% glucose for 1 h at 37 °C for invertase induction. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Internal and external invertase activities were measured at the beginning and end of the shift. The percentage of total invertase secretion was calculated as Δexternal/(Δexternal + Δinternal). Media Secretion Assay—For collection and staining of media glycoproteins, wild-type and exo84 mutant cells were grown overnight at 25 °C from stationary cell culture and harvested before the A600 reached 1.0. About 24 A600 units of cells were resuspended in 40 ml of pre-warmed medium and incubated in a 37 °C shaker for 1 h. The supernatant was centrifuged twice, and 30 ml of the supernatant were transferred to a new tube containing 120 μl of 2% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate and incubated for 30 min on ice. Samples were precipitated with 1.9 ml of 100% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, followed by a 1-h incubation on ice. The mixtures were spun down at 3600 rpm for 30 min with brake off to avoid disturbing the pellet. The pellets and 1 ml of the remaining supernatant were transferred to new 2-ml screw cap tubes and spun at high speed for 10 min to thoroughly pellet the precipitated protein. The trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were then washed twice with acetone, air-dried, and dissolved into 34 μl of loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) for SDS-PAGE. The gel was first fixed in 10% acetic acid and 40% ethanol for 30 min and incubated in 7.5% acetic acid for 10 min and then in 1% periodic acid for 15 min. After six washes with distilled water, the gel was incubated in Schiff reagent (27Zacharius R.M. Zell T.E. Morrison J.H. Woodlock J.J. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 30: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar) for 15 min. The gel was washed with water briefly and then three times for 10 min with freshly prepared 0.5% sodium metabisulfate. Finally, the gel was washed with water to remove excess staining. The profile of the glycoproteins upon SDS-PAGE was similar to that obtained by the method using metabolically labeled cells (28Gaynor E.C. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) Assay—To analyze the transport and maturation of CPY (29Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2241-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), yeast cells were grown at 25 °C in synthetic medium supplemented with amino acids to an A600 of 0.5–1.0. Cells were harvested, resuspended at a concentration of 5 A600 units/ml in SC medium, and shifted to the experimental temperature of 25 or 37 °C for 30 min. Cultures were preincubated at the appropriate experimental temperature for 5 min and then labeled with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine/cell suspension. After labeling, cultures were chased by the addition of 5 mm methionine, 1 mm cysteine, and 0.2% yeast extract. After appropriate chase periods, samples were harvested and precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to 10% final concentration. Whole cell lysates were generated by glass bead disruption in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS, followed by boiling at 95 °C for 3 min. 1 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Tween 20 was added to the heated samples for immunoprecipitation with anti-CPY antibody. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Electron Microscopy—Cells were grown to early log phase and shifted to 25 or 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were then collected by vacuum filtration using a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane and fixed for 1 h at room temperature in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 3% formaldehyde, 1 mm MgCl2,and1mm CaCl2. The cells were processed further as described by Mulholland et al. (30Mulholland J. Preuss D. Moon A. Wong A. Drubin D. Botstein D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). After dehydration and embedding in Spurr (Polysciences, Inc.), thin sections were cut out, transferred onto 600-mesh uncoated copper grids (Ernest F. Fullam, Inc.), and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Cells were observed on a JEOL 1010 transmission electron microscope. Fluorescence Microscopy—Chromosomal tagging of the exocyst by green fluorescent protein (GFP) was performed as described previously (9Guo W. Grant A. Novick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23558-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 11Finger F. Hughes T. Novick P.

GFP tagging of the yeast exocyst components does not affect the functions of these proteins, as there is no difference in cell growth under all of the conditions tested when the GFP-tagged version is the sole copy of the exocyst in the genome (9Guo W.

For microscopy examination, cells were grown to early log phase (A600 = 0.6) in uracildeficient SC medium containing 2% dextrose and fixed as described previously (19Zajac A. Sun X. Zhang J. Guo W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1500-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). GFP was scored as mislocalized when it appeared diffused or in multiple patches in the mother cells. Protein localization in yeast cells released from G0 phase was examined as described previously (22Ayscough K.R. Stryker J. Pokala N. Sanders M. Crews P. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Immunostaining of endogenous Sec4p in yeast cells was performed as described previously (32Walch-Solimena C. Collins R.N. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1495-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Anti-Sec4p polyclonal antibody was used at 1:1000 dilution. Isolation of the Exocyst Complex—Immunoisolation of the exocyst complex from [35S]cysteine/methionine-labeled yeast cells was carried out as described previously (8TerBush D.R. Maurice T. Roth D. Novick P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6483-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The proteins were separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. exo84 Mutants Are Specifically Defective in Post-Golgi Secretion—EXO84 is an essential gene that encodes a protein that migrates at 90 kDa upon SDS-PAGE (9Guo W. Grant A. Novick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23558-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To facilitate our study of Exo84p and the exocyst complex by genetic and biochemical methods, we carried out experiments to generate temperature-sensitive yeast strains carrying mutations in the EXO84 gene. Eight temperature-sensitive exo84 mutants were obtained by PCR-based random mutagenesis of the full-length EXO84 open reading frame as described under “Materials and Methods.” Sequence analyses indicated that most of the mutations are positioned at the C terminus of Exo84p (data not shown). We reintroduced the isolated plasmids bearing the mutated exo84 DNA into a host strain in which the EXO84 gene was deleted and replaced with HIS3. These strains are viable at 25 °C but not at 37 °C, indicating that these temperature-sensitive mutants were indeed caused by mutations in EXO84. These temperature-sensitive exo84 mutants are subsequently referred to as exo84-102, exo84-110, exo84-112, exo84-113, exo84-117, exo84-121, exo84-122, and exo84-125. We first examined the secretory properties of the exo84 mutants using the invertase assay. Invertase follows the secretory pathway and is secreted to the periplasmic space. It has been used as an enzymatic marker for exocytosis (26Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Cells were shifted to low glucose medium to induce the expression of invertase and grown at the restrictive temperature of 37 °C for 1 h. We found that all of the mutant strains showed different degrees of invertase secretion defects (Fig. 1A). In particular, the exo84-112 strain secreted only 10% of the total invertase produced into the medium. The wild-type strain (used as a control) secreted 98% of the total invertase produced. A previous study suggests that there are several classes of vesicles designated to the plasma membrane for exocytosis (33Harsay E. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To examine the general secretion profile of these exo84 mutants, we adapted a method to stain the glycoproteins secreted into the medium by the yeast cells (27Zacharius R.M. Zell T.E. Morrison J.H. Woodlock J.J. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 30: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Wild-type and exo84-110, exo84-112, exo84-121, and exo84-125 cells were shifted from 25 to 37 °C for 1 h. Glycoproteins secreted into the medium were collected by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The resulting gel was stained with periodic acid-Schiff, which recognized all of the glycoproteins. The intensity of the stained proteins reflects the amounts of glycoproteins secreted into the medium. Wild-type and sec6-4 (a known late sec mutant) cells were used as controls. As shown in Fig. 1B, sec6-4 had very faint staining compared with the wild-type strain, as expected. exo84-112 and sec6-4 had similar staining patterns. The other three exo84 mutants had stronger staining compared with exo84-112, although they were still much weaker compared with the wild-type strain. Combining the results from the invertase secretion and media protein secretion assays, we conclude that Exo84p plays an important role in the yeast secretory pathway. To determine whether other stages of the secretory pathway are blocked in the exo84 mutant cells, we examined the processing of CPY in wild-type and mutant strains. CPY is a vacuolar enzyme that is transported from the late Golgi compartment to vacuoles, where it is cleaved into its mature form (34Valls L.A. Hunter C.P. Rothman J.H. Stevens T.H. Cell. 1987; 48: 887-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Because it is not secreted to the plasma membrane, post-Golgi secretory mutants do not affect CPY traffic. Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and chased with fresh medium at 25 or 37 °C for 30 min. Whole cell lysates were prepared from wild-type, exo84-112, and exo84-125 strains and immunoprecipitated by anti-CPY antibody. The immunoprecipitated CPY was subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The results demonstrate that the exo84 mutant was able to process CPY efficiently at both the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi stage (Fig. 2, P2) and the Golgi-to-vacuole stage (M) at 37 °C. Therefore, the secretion defect observed in the exo84 mutants is specific to the Golgi-plasma membrane stage. To visualize the secretion defects in the exo84 mutants, we used electron microscopy to examine the internal membrane structures in the exo84 mutant cells. We chose the exo84-112 (GY2478) and exo84-121 (GY2479) mutant strains for this study because they have different degrees of media glycoprotein secretion defects. Cells were grown at 25 °C, and half of the cells were then shifted to 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were processed for thin section electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3A, shifting to the restrictive temperature of 37 °C for 1 h led to accumulation of a large number of vesicles in both exo84-112 (at 25 °C, 13 ± 10/section, n = 7; and at 37 °C, 145 ± 43/section, n = 9) and exo84-121 (at 25 °C, 3 ± 2/section, n = 9; and at 37 °C, 72 ± 15/section, n = 12). More vesicles accumulated in exo84-112 than in exo84-121, consistent with the invertase assay and media glycoprotein secretion assay results (Fig. 1). The vesicles were 80–100 nm in diameter, typical of post-Golgi stage secretory vesicles (26Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). In addition, we did not observe any defects in other intracellular organelles. The vesicles seemed to be preferentially distributed to the bud and mother-daughter junction regions. However, the thin sectioning of the samples in the electron microscopy procedure made it difficult to draw definitive conclusion. We therefore examined the localization of Sec4p (which resides on the post-Golgi vesicles) in the mutants by immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig. 3B, although not as concentrated as the signal in the wild-type cells, the Sec4p signal generally remained polarized. This result suggests that vesicles can be transported along actin cables in a polarized fashion to the buds in exo84 mutants. However, these vesicles cannot efficiently fuse with the plasma membrane as a consequence of the loss of Exo84p function. Similar observations have been reported for the other exocyst mutants (32Walch-Solimena C. Collins R.N. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997;"
https://openalex.org/W2085396807,"We evaluate here whether RAD51 and its paralogues XRCC2 and XRCC3 act via a common pathway for sensitivity to genotoxic stress, centrosome fragmentation and chromosome stability. We expressed the RAD51 dominant-negative SMRAD51 in irs1 and irs1SF cells, defective for XRCC2 and XRCC3, respectively, and in their corresponding wild-type cells (V79 and AA8, respectively). V79-SMRAD51 cells are sensitive to mitomycin C (MMC), but SMRAD51 did not further sensitize irs1 cells to MMC, showing that SMRAD51 and XRCC2 act on the same pathway for resistance to MMC. However, in contrast to irs1 and irs1SF cells, SMRAD51-V79 and SMRAD51-AA8 cells are not sensitive to γ-rays or UV-C. Despite these differences in sensitivity, SMRAD51-expressing cells and xrcc2- or xrcc3-defective cells show similar increased levels of centrosome fragmentation. This spontaneous centrosome fragmentation is resistant to caffeine, suggesting that ATM and ATR are not involved. Consistent with centrosome fragmentation, increased aneuploidy was measured in irs1 and SMRAD51-expressing cells. Expression of SMRAD51 in irs1 or irs1SF cells did not increase further the frequency of multipolar cells. Thus, RAD51, XRCC2 and XRCC3 act in the same pathway for centrosome fragmentation, independently of the sensitivity to exogenous genotoxic stresses and of the ATM/ATR pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1992122740,"The intracellular mechanisms of ischemic preconditioning (PC) in preventing lung dysfunction following transplantation, shock, and trauma remain poorly understood. Previously, we have shown that alveolar epithelial cells secrete calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) under inflammatory stress. Using a hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) and PC model, we found that CGRP was also secreted from human type II alveolar epithelial cells (A549) after PC. The locally released CGRP interacted with its receptor on the membrane of A549 cells and elicited downstream signals mediating the PC effect, because hCGRP8–37, a specific CGRP receptor antagonist, attenuated the protective effect of PC. Pre-inhibition of CGRP protein synthesis by small interfering RNA exacerbated (but overexpression of the CGRP gene ameliorated) H/R-induced cell death, which supports the autocrine effect of CGRP on A549 cells. Exogenous bioactive CGRP mimicked the beneficial effect of PC and up-regulated the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), which might act as the end effector to maintain cell viability. These effects were sensitive to hCGRP8–37, calphostin C (a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor), and 5-hydroxydecanoic acid (a mitochondrial K+ATP channel blocker) but were insensitive to protein kinase A blockers. Moreover, CGRP induced the membrane translocation of PKCϵ. PKCV1–2 (a cell-permeable inhibitory peptide of PKCϵ) effectively abolished CGRP-induced HSP70 expression and cell protection. Therefore, PC induces CGRP secretion from human alveolar epithelial cells, and the locally released CGRP acts back on these cells, protecting them from H/R injury. The post-receptor signaling of CGRP is through PKCϵ-dependent expression of HSP70.

The post-receptor signaling of CGRP is through PKCϵ-dependent expression of HSP70. It is well known that the lung is highly susceptible to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) 1The abbreviations used are: I/R, ischemia/reperfusion; PC, preconditioning; CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; H/R, hypoxia/reoxygenation; HSP, heat shock protein; cAMP, cyclic AMP; PKC, protein kinase C; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; 5HD, 5-hydroxydecanoic acid. injury. Studies have highlighted several aspects of the pathological changes by I/R as well as targets for treatment, including inflammatory infiltration, functional impairment, and loss of cell viability (1de Perrot M. Liu M. Waddell T.K. Keshavjee S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 167: 490-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Although suppression of immune responses and improvement of alveolar fluid clearance has received much attention, only a few studies directly evaluated the I/R injury of alveolar epithelial cells, especially type II epithelial cells that have multiple roles in maintaining the local homeostasis and integrity of alveoli (2Fehrenbach H. Respir. Res. 2001; 2: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Ischemic preconditioning (PC) is a genetically conservative, intrinsic, and self-protective process that effectively defends I/R injury in various systems, including the heart, kidney, and lung (1de Perrot M. Liu M. Waddell T.K. Keshavjee S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 167: 490-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 3Yellon D.M. Downey J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1113-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). For instance, PC prevents cardiac myocytes from I/R-induced cell death through several well defined pathways (4Schulz R. Cohen M.V. Behrends M. Downey J.M. Heusch G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 52: 181-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Numerous exogenous and endogenous agents have been verified to mimic the PC effect on myocytes in vitro (5Napoli C. Pinto A. Cirino G. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 88: 311-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These well developed models and procedures can be transplanted to the field of lung I/R and PC research to promote these studies at the single cell and subcellular level. As a widely existing neuropeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has broad regulatory effects throughout the body, especially in the cardiovascular and respiratory system (6Bell D. McDermott B.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1996; 48: 253-258PubMed Google Scholar, 7Dakhama A. Larsen G.L. Gelfand E.W. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition to its well known effects on vasodilation (8Brain S.D. Williams T.J. Tippins J.R. Morris H.R. MacIntyre I. Nature. 1985; 313: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar), immunomodulation (9Sun W. Wang L. Zhang Z. Chen M. Wang X. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and repression of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation (10Li Y. Fiscus R.R. Wu J. Yang L. Wang X. Neuropeptides. 1997; 31: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Wang W. Sun W. Wang X. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H1582-H1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), CGRP has also been implicated to have a protective role in preconditioning of isolated rat hearts and intestines (12Kallner G. Franco-Cereceda A. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1998; 32: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Xiao L. Lu R. Hu C.P. Deng H.W. Li Y.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 427: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Regarding the lung, both CGRP and its receptor are expressed in type II alveolar epithelial cells. The basal secretion of CGRP from these cells helps to retain airway homeostasis, whereas enhanced release of CGRP under inflammatory stress plays a negative feedback role in inhibiting local immunoreaction (7Dakhama A. Larsen G.L. Gelfand E.W. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14Li W. Hou L. Hua Z. Wang X. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1603-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These lines of evidence indicate the diverse benefits of CGRP under both physiological and pathological conditions in alveoli. Whether locally released CGRP plays a role in lung I/R injury or participates in the protective effect of PC is unknown. The present study was designed to evaluate the role of CGRP in lung I/R and PC with a hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) model in the type II alveolar epithelial cell line (A549) that is sensitive to ischemia. The results suggest an autocrine mechanism of CGRP mediating the PC effect in these cells. The post-receptor signaling of CGRP relies on activation of protein kinase Cϵ (PKCϵ), which led to the induced expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). Materials—Recombinant human αCGRP, hCGRP8–37, and anti-CGRP antibody were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. (Belmont, CA). Calphostin C, Rp-cAMPS and H89 were from Calbiochem. Glybenclamide and 5-hydroxydecanoic acid were from Sigma. Myristoylated PKCϵ inhibitory peptide (PKCV1–2) was from Biomol International L.P. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents were from Pierce. Anti-HSP70 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-PKCϵ antibody was from Pharmingen. Anti-actin antibody was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Cell culture media and supplements were from Hyclone (South Logan, UT). The BBL™ GasPak™ anaerobic system was from BD Biosciences. This system relies on serial chemical reactions, which consume oxygen and release CO2, to achieve an anaerobic environment with 4–10% of CO2. Cell Culture—A549 cells were a kind gift from Dr. Remick (Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School). Dr. Remick purchased the cells from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For all experiments, cells were used at 70–80% confluence. The cells were cultivated in fetal bovine serum-free medium for 1–2 h before being exposed to different chemicals. Setting Up H/R and PC Models—Experiments were carried out in six groups (as shown in Fig. 1A) with: 1) normoxic cultured cells and 2) H/R cells incubated with Hanks' solution (free of gas and glucose) in the anaerobic system for 6 h, followed by normoxic culture in fetal bovine serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h; 3) cells in the PC group first cultured in Hanks' solution (free of gas and glucose) for 10 min, fetal bovine serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 10 min, and then H/R treatment; 4) inhibitors added 30 min prior to PC treatment to block the effects of PC; 5) CGRP added 1 h before H/R treatment; and 6) inhibitors added 30 min before CGRP to block the effects of CGRP. Inhibition of CGRP Expression by Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)— Because our previous results have shown that A549 cells expressed only β-CGRP (but not α-CGRP) (14Li W. Hou L. Hua Z. Wang X. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1603-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), construction of an RNA interfering plasmid for the β-CGRP gene involved the use of a pSuper plasmid containing the H1-RNA promoter in concert with a pair of 64 oligonucleotides, each containing the unique sequence of 19 nucleotides (the underlined sequence of sense and antisense orientation) derived from the human CGRP gene: forward oligo, 5′-GATCCCCCACTGCCACCTGTGTGACTTTCAAGAGAAGTCACACAGGTGGCAGTGTTTTTGGAAA-3′; reverse oligo, 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAACACTGCCACCTGTGTGACTTCTCTTGAAAGTCACACAGGTGGCAGTGGGG-3′). The sequence for siRNA was empirically selected and underwent a BLAST software search to ensure no significant homology with other genes. These oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into the vector between the BglII/HindIII sites and transferred to A549 cells with use of Lipofectin (Invitrogen). For stable inhibition of CGRP, 2 μg of pSuper-CGRP was cotransfected with 1 μg of pBABE-puro plasmid. The transfected cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin for 7 days. Monoclones were chosen and expanded. Reverse transcription-PCR and radioimmunoassay showed the decreased CGRP mRNA level and protein secretion by 50–70% in transfected cells (see supplemental Fig. 1). Stable Transfer of CGRP Gene into A549 Cells—A pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing human CGRP cDNA was constructed as previously described (9Sun W. Wang L. Zhang Z. Chen M. Wang X. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and transferred to A549 cells with the use of Lipofectin. After transfection, the cells were cultured in the presence of G418 (800 μg/ml) for 4 days, and a stable transferred cell line was selected by subculturing the cells from a monoclone. Cell Viability Assay—The cell injury index was determined by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and counting trypan blue-positive cells. After 24 h of reoxygenation, LDH contents were analyzed in culture medium by use of a biochemical autoanalyzer (7170A, Hitachi) or a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Applied Science). The cells were trypsinized, stained with 0.04% trypan blue, and counted using a cytometer to measure the living cells, dead cells, and the mortality rate. Radioimmunoassay—Radioimmunoassay of CGRP was carried out following a procedure previously used in our laboratory (15Wang X. Han C.D. Fiscus R.R. Qi M. Jones S.B. Circ. Shock. 1991; 34: 217-223PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the culture supernatants were collected and vacuum-dried. Samples were incubated with anti-CGRP antibody at 4 °C for 24 h. After the addition of 125I-labeled CGRP, samples were further incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. The bound radioactivity of calibrators, controls, and samples was measured in duplicate with use of a γ scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). Western Blotting—Cells were lysed, homogenized by ultrasound, and boiled for 5 min. Following quantification of the protein concentration using the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce), cell extracts were loaded onto 10% bis-acrylamide gels and separated by SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred from gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and underwent immunoblotting to reveal HSP70 proteins using anti-HSP70 antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and chemiluminescence. The protein bands were quantitatively analyzed using Kodak 1D image analysis software. For membrane protein extraction, whole cell lysate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant after the second centrifugation was used as a cytosol fraction. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and was used as a membrane fraction. Western blotting was carried out with mouse anti-PKCϵ antibody (1:500–1000). Statistics—The results are expressed as means ± S.E. Data analysis involved use of GraphPad Prism software. One-way analysis of variance, Student-Newman-Keuls test (comparisons between multiple groups), or unpaired Student's t test (between 2 groups) was employed as appropriate. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. Setting Up H/R and Preconditioning Models—A cellular model of H/R and PC was created by use of the anaerobic system and multiple procedures as described under “Materials and Methods” and Fig. 1A. A549 cells were exposed to prolonged hypoxia for 6 h followed by reoxygenation for 24 h (H/R). Cell injury was revealed by increased LDH content in the culture medium, double the number of trypan blue-positive cells and profound cell morphological changes, including cell shrinkage, detachment, and fragmentation after H/R (Fig. 1, B and C). PC treatment (10-min hypoxic and 10-min normoxic culture prior to H/R) efficiently prevented A549 cells from H/R-induced cell damage (Fig. 1, B and C). Role of Endogenous CGRP in PC—Previous studies have shown that CGRP content was increased in ischemic and reperfused tissues, which suggests that endogenous CGRP may play a role in ischemia and reperfusion (16Lechleitner P. Genser N. Mair J. Dienstl A. Haring C. Wiedermann C.J. Puschendorf B. Saria A. Dienstl F. Am. Heart J. 1992; 124: 1433-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We carried out experiments to detect CGRP secretion in A549 cells during a broad time scale after H/R and PC. The basal level of CGRP in the culture supernatant of A549 cells was 40 pg/ml and remained stable during normoxic culture. The CGRP secretion was increased after hypoxia and remained at a high level during 24-h reoxygenation (data not shown). More importantly, PC also induced CGRP secretion in A549 cells, which persisted up to 24 h (Fig. 2A). Because the CGRP receptor is also expressed on the membrane of A549 cells (14Li W. Hou L. Hua Z. Wang X. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1603-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we tested whether this secreted CGRP played a role in PC. Pre-incubation of hCGRP8–37 (100 nm), a CGRP1 receptor antagonist, significantly attenuated the protective effect of PC (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that CGRP is secreted in response to PC, and the endogenous CGRP mediates, at least in part, the protective effect of PC against H/R injury in A549 cells. To confirm that the endogenous CGRP has cell protective effects, we used molecular and genetic manipulation of the CGRP expression. Knock down of CGRP mRNA by siRNA specifically attenuated both the CGRP mRNA level in A549 cells and protein secretion in the culture supernatant to 30–50% of that of controls, without influencing the expression of other related peptides, adrenomedullin, amylin, and calcitonin (see supplemental Fig. 1). Inhibition of CGRP expression by siRNA exacerbated H/R-induced cell damage in A549 cells (Fig. 3A). However, A549 cells stably transferred with the CGRP gene were resistant to H/R-induced cell death (Fig. 3B). Consistent with the results in Fig. 2B, these data support a cell-protective effect of endogenous CGRP against H/R injury. Exogenous CGRP Mimicked the Effect of PC—To study the causal role of CGRP in cell protection further, we used a bioactive CGRP peptide to preincubate A549 cells before H/R. As revealed by LDH release and cell counting, preincubation with CGRP (10–100 nm) for 1 h reduced the cell damage induced by subsequent H/R. This effect was comparable with the protective effect of PC and was sensitive to hCGRP8–37 (1 μm) (Fig. 4). These data suggest that exogenous CGRP mimics the PC effect that protects A549 cells against H/R injury through the CGRP1 receptor. CGRP Up-regulated HSP70 Expression in A549 Cells—Heat shock proteins (HSPs), a group of inducible chaperones, are involved in responses to various stresses, including H/R (17Benjamin I.J. McMillan D.R. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). The PC-induced expression of HSP70 is a major downstream event leading to cell protection against H/R injury (18Latchman D.S. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 51: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used HSP70 expression to evaluate the mechanism of the role of CGRP in H/R and PC further. As shown in Fig. 5A, both PC and bioactive CGRP (100 nm) doubled the protein level of HSP70 as compared with normoxia controls or cells under H/R. CGRP interfering RNA lowered the HSP70 protein level in normal cultured A549 cells (data not shown) and in cells after H/R treatment (Fig. 5B), whereas overexpression of the CGRP gene increased HSP70 expression in normoxic cultured cells (data not shown) and in cells under H/R (Fig. 5C). Thus, CGRP directly up-regulates HSP70 expression, which may explain the mechanism of CGRP in cell protection against H/R injury. PKC and Mitochondrial K+ATP Channel-mediated CGRP Effects—To elucidate the intracellular signaling pathway responsible for the effects of CGRP on cell protection and HSP70 expression, various pathways that may participate in PC, such as the cAMP/PKA, PKC, and K+ATP channels, were tested. The cAMP/PKA pathway is the major downstream mediator of CGRP in many cell types (19Wimalawansa S.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 533-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). However, Rp-cAMPs (10–100 μm), a specific cell permeable inhibitor of PKA, failed to block the cell protection or the increased HSP70 expression by CGRP. A nonspecific cAMP/PKA inhibitor, H89 (10–100 nm), partially reversed the effects of CGRP (see supplemental Figs. 2 and 3). These data indicate that the cAMP/PKA pathway may not play a major role in cell protection and induction of HSP70 by CGRP in A549 cells. Next, we tested the PKC and K+ATP channel, especially the mitochondrial K+ATP channel, because they are well known to mediate the effect of PC. Calphostin C (500 nm), a nonselective PKC inhibitor, significantly reversed the effects of CGRP on cell protection and HSP70 expression (Fig. 6, A and C). The nonselective K+ATP channel inhibitor glybenclamide (100 μm) was unable to block the effects of CGRP, whereas a selective mitochondrial K+ATP channel blocker, 5-hydroxydecanoic acid (5HD, 10–100 μm), antagonized the CGRP-induced cell protection and HSP70 expression (Fig. 6, B and D). No further effect was detected when calphostin C (500 nm) and 5HD (100 μm) were added together (Fig. 6, B and D). These data suggest that the PKC and mitochondrial K+ATP channels are essential in mediating the effects of CGRP on cell protection and HSP70 expression. Because PKC can activate the mitochondrial K+ATP channel (20Wang Y. Ashraf M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1156-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 21Sato T. O'Rourke B. Marban E. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and blockade of both factors exerted no additive effects, they may act sequentially rather than in parallel. Role of PKCϵ in CGRP Effects—Among different PKC isoforms, PKCϵ is regarded as a crucial mediator of the PC-induced cell protection (22Ping P. Zhang J. Qiu Y. Tang X.L. Manchikalapudi S. Cao X. Bolli R. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 23Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30945-30951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Upon activation, PKCϵ translocates to a unique subcellular locale next to its specific substrates, including the mitochondrial K+ATP channel (24Ohnuma Y. Miura T. Miki T. Tanno M. Kuno A. Tsuchida A. Shimamoto K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H440-H447Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have detected the CGRP-induced membrane translocation of PKCϵ in A549 cells. This translocation began at 10 min and gradually increased up to 1 h after CGRP (100 nm) incubation (Fig. 7). After 1 h of CGRP treatment, the ratio of cytosolic fraction to membrane fraction of PKCϵ was reversed because of the significant translocation of PKCϵ to the membrane. Therefore, CGRP promotes the activation and translocation of PKCϵ in A549 cells. The question that followed was whether the activation and translocation of PKCϵ play roles in CGRP-induced cell protection and HSP70 expression. To address this issue, we introduced a specific and cell-permeable PKCϵ inhibitory peptide (PKCV1–2, 10 μm) into A549 cells prior to CGRP treatment. Preincubation with PKCV1–2 totally abolished the effect of CGRP on cell protection (Fig. 8A) and HSP70 expression (Fig. 8B). These data strongly demonstrate that PKCϵ is the intracellular mediator of CGRP-induced cell protection and HSP70 expression in H/R of A549 cells. In the present study, we have demonstrated that CGRP mediates the protective effect of hypoxic preconditioning against H/R injury in human alveolar epithelial cells through the activation of PKCϵ and expression of HSP70. Preconditioning promotes the secretion of CGRP from A549 cells, and CGRP provides feedback in an autocrine manner, interacting with its receptors on the cell membrane. Among various intracellular signaling pathways of CGRP, the activation and translocation of PKCϵ (but not the cAMP/PKA pathway) play critical roles in the recruitment of downstream factors, including mitochondrial K+ATP channels, to finally induce HSP70 expression, thus protecting against H/R injury. Therefore, we show, for the first time, the causative role of CGRP in pulmonary PC in the cellular H/R model. It is also noteworthy that, by use of molecular biological approaches and a subtype-specific peptide inhibitor, we have provided solid evidence showing the activation of PKCϵ by CGRP, which leads to HSP70 expression and the mediating role of PKCϵ in CGRP-induced cell protection. The present study provides a unique example of how a locally released bioactive agent that plays important regulatory roles under physiological conditions is also required for dealing with pathological circumstances. Studying the trigger phase of ischemic PC has implications for pharmacological PC, which involves the use of certain substances to mimic the effect of ischemic PC. So far, most of the substances used are metabolites or by-products of ischemia and reperfusion. For example, adenosine, in which the cell protective role and detailed intracellular mechanisms are well explored, is the metabolite of nucleoside accumulated during ischemia (25Mubagwa K. Flameng W. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 52: 25-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species not only trigger but also mediate PC and are mainly produced during reoxygenation by mitochondria (26Becker L.B. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 61: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). One of the agents comparable with CGRP is nitric oxide, an important regulator of normal arterial tension, which may also protect against H/R injury (27Schulz R. Kelm M. Heusch G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 61: 402-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, the role of nitric oxide is controversial, because it shows protective as well as detrimental effects depending on different mechanisms (28Ferdinandy P. Schulz R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 532-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In the case of CGRP, studies by us and others support the diverse beneficial effects of CGRP under physiological and pathological conditions. Recently, we have shown that CGRP secretion can be induced by an inflammatory factor in type II alveolar epithelial cells, and the released CGRP plays a negative feedback role by suppressing the expression of chemokines in these cells (14Li W. Hou L. Hua Z. Wang X. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1603-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that CGRP is also secreted from alveolar epithelial cells in response to PC, and the CGRP receptor blockade abolishes the effect of PC in these cells (Fig. 2). Therefore, the lung may be a beneficiary of CGRP protection in both inflammation and H/R injury. Indeed, as we manipulated CGRP expression by siRNA, a novel approach that can effectively lower messenger RNA stability and translation without influencing the genome profile (29Dorsett Y. Tuschl T. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 318-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), the decreased CGRP expression and secretion correlates well with the increased cell damage and decreased HSP70 expression (Figs. 3A and 5B). However, overexpression of the CGRP gene by stable transfer of CGRP cDNA protects the cell as effectively as hypoxic PC (Fig. 3B). These two lines of evidence, from different directions, reach the same conclusion that the self-secreted CGRP is both necessary and sufficient in mediating the protective effect of PC in lung cells. These results also extend the previous notion of the role of CGRP in ischemia of the heart and intestine (12Kallner G. Franco-Cereceda A. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1998; 32: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Xiao L. Lu R. Hu C.P. Deng H.W. Li Y.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 427: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because different stress signaling pathways converge on HSP70 and cells rely on the chaperoning property of HSP70 for maintaining their functional and structural integrity and withstanding H/R injury (30Wong H.R. Menendez I.Y. Ryan M.A. Denenberg A.G. Wispe J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L836-L841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesize that CGRP also recruits HSP70 to carry out its protective effect in A549 cells. Indeed, CGRP significantly increases HSP70 expression to a level comparable with that induced by PC. Furthermore, HSP70 expression is proportional to CGRP expression in A549 cells and is inhibited by blockers of the CGRP downstream signaling pathway (Fig. 5). Therefore, HSP70 can be the key end effector mediating CGRP-induced cell protection. While dissecting the detailed post-receptor signaling of CGRP, we found that the well established Gsα/cAMP/PKA pathway that mediates most of the effects of CGRP in other cell types plays a minor, if any, role in protecting A549 cells from H/R injury. However, it has been proposed that CGRP can activate phospholipase C via Gq/11 and increase intracellular Ca2+ independent of the cAMP/PKA pathway in osteoblast cells (31Drissi H. Lasmoles F. Le Mellay V. Marie P.J. Lieberherr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20168-20174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32Drissi H. Lieberherr M. Hott M. Marie P.J. Lasmoles F. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether other signaling pathways are activated by CGRP in alveolar epithelial cells. The PKC inhibitor and mitochondrial K+ATP channel blocker results strongly suggest that the PKC/mK+ATP pathway is responsible for the effect of CGRP on HSP70 expression and cell protection in A549 cells (Fig. 6). This suggestion is logical, because PKC is the major survival pathway mediating the cell-protective effects of various agents against H/R injury in many cell types (33Simkhovich B.Z. Przyklenk K. Kloner R.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 40: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial K+ATP channel, which existence has been identified pharmacologically but not structurally, is the downstream target of PKC (20Wang Y. Ashraf M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1156-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 21Sato T. O'Rourke B. Marban E. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 34Gross G.J. Peart J.N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: H921-H930Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). As well, the expression of HSP70 is also regulated by PKC during PC (35Ding X.Z. Tsokos G.C. Kiang J.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To appraise the role of PKC in mediating the protective effect of CGRP against H/R injury, we focused on the ϵ subtype of PKC because PKCϵ activation protects cells against H/R injury (36Chen L. Hahn H. Wu G. Chen C.H. Liron T. Schechtman D. Cavallaro G. Banci L. Guo Y. Bolli R. Dorn II, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11114-11119Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that PKCϵ is activated and translocated to the membrane fraction of the cells by CGRP (Fig. 7). Furthermore, activated PKCϵ mediates the protective effect of CGRP as well as HSP70 expression in A549 cells (Fig. 8). Thus, PKCϵ (but not the cAMP/PKA pathway) represents the downstream signaling of CGRP in alveolar epithelial cells. Whether other subtypes of PKC are also activated and involved in the effect of CGRP remains elusive. Our preliminary data allowed us to suggest that the δ subtype of PKC may not be activated by CGRP in A549 cells. Because PKCδ is thought to mediate the detrimental effect of reperfusion injury (37Inagaki K. Hahn H.S. Dorn II, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Circulation. 2003; 108: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), the selective activation of protective PKC subtypes by CGRP merits investigation to avoid unnecessary side effects. Our finding of CGRP as an intrinsic factor that protects lung cells from H/R damage will not only benefit investigations into therapy for obstructive and ischemic pulmonary diseases but also provide a new candidate for treating other ischemic diseases, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Although previous study has shown the activation of PKC by CGRP in osteoblast cells (38Villa I. Dal Fiume C. Maestroni A. Rubinacci A. Ravasi F. Guidobono F. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E627-E633Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), our study is the first to clarify that the PKCϵ subtype is selectively activated by CGRP in alveolar epithelial cells. Further studies are warranted to elucidate whether the CGRP/PKCϵ/HSP70 pathway also plays a role in the effect of CGRP in other cell types, especially the endothelial cells, cardiac myocytes, and neurons. The detailed downstream mediators of CGRP and their sequential activation should be clarified, as should the possible interaction of CGRP with other important factors, such as reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide in H/R. In summary, alveolar epithelial cells secrete CGRP in response to ischemic PC. CGRP mediates the protective effect of PC in these cells in an autocrine manner. The activation of PKCϵ, which leads to the opening of the mitochondrial K+ATP channel and induction of HSP70 expression, is the major downstream signaling effect of CGRP against H/R injury.

In the pig, this activity is conferred by tri- and tetraantennary complex type chains; in cattle, it is conferred by a chain of 5 mannose residues. In this study, porcine zona glycoproteins were expressed as secreted forms, using the baculovirus-Sf9 insect cell system. The sperm binding activities of the recombinant proteins were examined in three different assays. The assays clearly demonstrated that recombinant ZPB bound bovine sperm weakly but did not bind porcine sperm; when recombinant ZPC was also present, bovine sperm binding activity was greatly increased, but porcine sperm still was not bound. The major sugar chains of ZPB were pauci and high mannose type chains that were similar in structure to the major neutral N-linked chain of the bovine zona. In fact, the nonreducing terminal α-mannose residues were necessary for the sperm binding activity. These results show that the carbohydrate moieties of zona glycoproteins, but not the polypeptide moieties, play an essential role in species-selective recognition of porcine and bovine sperm. Moreover, Asn to Asp mutations at either of two of the N-glycosylation sites of ZPB, residue 203 or 220, significantly reduced the sperm binding activity of the ZPB/ZPC mixture, whereas a similar mutation at the third N-glycosylation site, Asn-333, had no effect on binding. These results suggest that the N-glycans located in the N-terminal half of the ZP domain of porcine ZPB are involved in sperm-zona binding.

These results suggest that the N-glycans located in the N-terminal half of the ZP domain of porcine ZPB are involved in sperm-zona binding. Mammalian oocytes are surrounded by a transparent envelope called the zona pellucida, which is involved in several critical aspects of fertilization. Its functions include species-selective recognition of sperm, blocking of polyspermy, and protection of the oocyte and embryo until implantation (1Litscher E.S. Wassarman P.M. Trends Glycosci.

Studies of the murine zona pellucida have established that the carbohydrate moieties of the ZPGs play an essential role in sperm binding.

Nevertheless, the suspected level of importance of the carbohydrate moieties in mouse sperm binding has declined because of the results of recent studies using genetically engineered mice that lack a glycosyltransferase, recent structural data on N- and O-linked carbohydrate chains of the mouse zona pellucida, and the determination of glycosylation sites on the mouse ZPGs, as outlined in recent reviews (13Jungnickel M.K.

Studies of the porcine and bovine zonae pellucidae underline the importance of the zona glycans in sperm-egg interactions, as described below.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7488-7494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). ZPB loses this activity when its N-linked carbohydrate chains are removed by N-glycanase digestion (21Yonezawa N. Aoki H. Hatanaka Y. Nakano M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Yonezawa N. Mitsui S. Kudo K. Nakano M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Neutral N-linked carbohydrate chains that are released from the ZPB/ZPC mixture on N-glycanase digestion retain their sperm binding activities (24Noguchi S. Hatanaka Y. Tobita T. Nakano M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Of these carbohydrate chains, the triantennary and tetraantennary complex type chains (Fig. 1A) bind more strongly than biantennary complex type chains (25Kudo K. Yonezawa N. Katsumata T. Aoki H. Nakano M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Conversely, it has been reported that O-linked carbohydrate chains, but not N-linked chains, specifically released from the ZPB/ZPC mixture inhibit sperm-egg binding (26Yurewicz E.C. Pack B.A. Sacco A.G. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1991; 30: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, both N- and O-linked carbohydrate chains are thought to act as ligands for sperm binding. Recent studies of the bovine zona pellucida reveal that ZPB has the highest sperm binding activity among the three bovine ZPGs (27Yonezawa N. Fukui N. Kuno M. Shinoda M. Goko S. Mitsui S. Nakano M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and that a high mannose type chain containing 5 Man residues (Fig. 1B) has sperm binding activity (28Amari S. Yonezawa N. Mitsui S. Katsumata T. Hamano S. Kuwayama M. Hashimoto Y. Suzuki A. Takeda Y. Nakano M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2001; 59: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Moreover, the nonreducing terminal α-Man residues are essential for this activity (28Amari S. Yonezawa N. Mitsui S. Katsumata T. Hamano S. Kuwayama M. Hashimoto Y. Suzuki A. Takeda Y. Nakano M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2001; 59: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, differences in the structures of the carbohydrate chains involved in sperm binding may explain the species-selective recognition of sperm by the ZPGs. Recombinant forms of the ZPGs have been expressed in yeast, insect, and mammalian cells, as well as in bacteria (29Gahlay G.K. Srivastava N. Govind C.K. Gupta S.K. J. Reprod.

However, the species selectivities of the sperm binding activities of these recombinant ZPGs have not been studied with respect to their carbohydrate structures. In this study, we expressed the porcine ZPGs as secreted, glycosylated forms using the baculovirus-Sf9 insect cell system, and we examined the sperm binding activities of the recombinant glycoproteins (rZPGs). Glycosylated rZPGs bound to bovine sperm but not to porcine sperm, suggesting that the carbohydrate moieties play an essential role in species selectivity of sperm-zona interactions. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of rZPGs—cDNAs encoding the secreted, mature polypeptides of porcine ZPA, ZPB, and ZPC were obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR using pig ovary poly(A)+ RNA as the template. The polypeptides of porcine ZPA, ZPB, and ZPC, which were expressed in this study correspond to the regions from Ile-36 to Arg-641, from Asp-137 to Arg-466, and from Asp-28 to Arg-348, respectively (4Harris J.D. Hibler D.W. Fontenot G.K. Hsu K.T. Yurewicz E.C. Sacco A.G. DNA Seq. 1994; 4: 361-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The translation initiation Met is numbered as 1. The poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from pig ovary according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). The 5′-sense primer for ZPA contained an XhoI site, and the 5′-sense primers for ZPB and ZPC contained BamHI sites. The 3′-antisense primer for ZPA contained a stop codon and XhoI site, and the 3′-antisense primers for ZPB and ZPC contained stop codons and BamHI sites. The PCR products were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels, and the bands of expected sizes were recovered from the gels and ligated to pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI). The DNA sequences of the PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The cDNAs were subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pBACgus-6 (Novagen, Madison, WI) to obtain the recombinant proteins as secreted proteins with N-terminal S and His tags using the XhoI and BamHI sites that were incorporated into the primers. Plasmid DNA preparations that contained individual cDNAs (0.25 μg) were transfected along with 0.1 μg of BacVector-2000 virus DNA (Novagen) into Sf9 cells using Eufectin (Novagen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant plaques were identified and purified by the plaque assay, according to the protocol supplied with the BacVector-2000 DNA kit (Novagen). Sf9 cells were routinely propagated in Sf-900 II serum-free medium (Invitrogen). Several purified plaques were examined for expression and secretion of the recombinant proteins. Sf9 cells (1.8 × 106 cells) were attached to the flask, infected with the recombinant virus from each purified plaque at a multiplicity of infection of 5–10, and cultured in 2.5 ml of Sf-900 II serum-free medium for 48 h at 27 °C. S protein-agarose (10 μl of suspension; Novagen), which was prewashed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), was mixed with 500 μl of the 48-h culture supernatant and shaken gently at room temperature for 30 min. The recombinant proteins bound to the S protein-agarose through their N-terminal S tags. After this period of incubation, the agarose beads were washed three times with PBS, followed each time by centrifugation. The pellet that contained the agarose beads was prepared for SDS-PAGE. For large scale protein production, the Sf9 cells (200 ml of 1.0 × 106 cells/ml of stock) were infected with the recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10. When two proteins were expressed simultaneously, the two recombinant viruses were added to the Sf9 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 5. After 48 h of culture in suspension, the medium was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to remove the cells, and the supernatant was filtrated through a 0.45-μm filter. The filtrate was sonicated and then stored at 4 °C. The filtered and sonicated supernatants were subjected to metal chelation column chromatography using His-Bind resin (Novagen), which was equilibrated with 5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 4 °C. After washing the column with 10 column volumes of the equilibration buffer, the bound protein was eluted with 6 column volumes of 60 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) followed by 6 column volumes of 1 m imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9). Construction of Mutated Porcine ZPB Genes by PCR—Mutations were introduced into porcine ZPB cDNA by two rounds of PCR. To mutate Asn-203 to Asp, the following pairs of primers were used for the first PCR: N203D mutation sense primer (5′-GTGTCTCGCGATGTGACCTCACCTCC-3′) and the 3′ antisense primer for ZPB described above, and the 5′-sense primer for ZPB described above and an EcoRI antisense primer (5′-GGGGAATTCATTGACTAGCATGGGCC-3′). Base substitutions (C to A and C to T, respectively) present at the fifth and eighth bases of the EcoRI antisense primer served to generate an EcoRI site. PCR products were electrophoresed on agarose gels, purified from the gels, and used as templates for the second PCR, which used the 5′-sense and 3′-antisense primers for ZPB. As a result, the PCR products that contained the desired N203D mutation did not have an EcoRI site. After treatment with EcoRI, those PCR products that were not digested were recovered from the agarose gel and ligated to pGEM-T Easy. The entire DNA sequence including the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To mutate Asn-220 or Asn-333 of ZPB to Asp, N220D or N333D sense primers (5′-CTGGCCTTCAGAGATGACAGTGAATG-3′ or 5′-GGCTCCTACTACGATGCTAGTGAC-3′, respectively) were used in place of the N203D sense primer. The underlined bases identify the replacement Asp codon. Electrophoresis, Immunoblot Analysis, and Lectin Blot Analysis of rZPGs—SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions, according to the Laemmli protocol (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The proteins were separated on 9–15% polyacrylamide gels and either visualized by silver staining or transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), according to the method of Towbin (38Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar), for the immunoblot and lectin blot analyses. For the immunoblot analysis, the membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 500 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) for 1 h. The membranes were incubated for 2 h with rabbit anti-porcine ZPA, rabbit anti-porcine ZPB, and rabbit anti-porcine ZPC polyclonal antibodies (25Kudo K. Yonezawa N. Katsumata T. Aoki H. Nakano M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 39Noguchi S. Yonezawa N. Katsumata T. Hashizume K. Kuwayama M. Hamano S. Watanabe S. Nakano M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that were diluted 1/200, 1/2,000, and 1/2,000, respectively, in TBS plus 1% BSA. After washing the membranes three times for 15 min each with TBS that contained 0.05% Tween 20 (T-TBS), the membranes were incubated for 1.5 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody that was diluted 1/1,000 in TBS plus 1% BSA. After washing the membranes three times for 15 min each with T-TBS, the blots were developed using an Immunostain kit (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan). For the lectin blots, the membranes were blocked with T-TBS for 1 h and then incubated for 2 h with 1 μg/ml either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated lectin or biotin-conjugated lectin in T-TBS that contained 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2. The following horseradish peroxidase-conjugated lectins were used in this study: concanavalin A (ConA), Lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA), and Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA120). The following biotin-conjugated lectins were used: Datura stramonium agglutinin (DSA), Phaseolus vulgaris agglutinin (PHA)-L4, Amaranthus candatus agglutinin (ACA), and Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA). ACA and GNA were purchased from EY Laboratories (San Mateo, CA), and the remaining lectins were from Seikagaku Kogyo. After washing the membranes three times for 15 min each with T-TBS that contained the metal ions, the peroxidase-conjugated lectins were developed as described above. The membranes that contained the biotin-conjugated lectins were incubated for an additional hour with 0.5 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Sigma) in T-TBS that contained the metal ions and were then washed three times for 15 min each with T-TBS that contained the metal ions followed by color development as described above. Glycopeptidase F Digestion of rZPGs—The digestion of each rZPG (about 0.4 μg) with glycopeptidase F (Takara, Shiga, Japan) was performed under denaturing conditions, according to the manufacturer's protocol. In addition, 10 mm o-phenanthroline was added to the solution. An aliquot that corresponded to 0 min of digestion was taken from the solution before the addition of the enzyme. Digestion was started by adding 1 milliunit of glycopeptidase F. Aliquots were taken at 1 and 5 min and at 24 h, and digestion was terminated by boiling. α-Mannosidase Digestion of a Mixture of Recombinant Porcine ZPB (rZPB) and Recombinant Porcine ZPC (rZPC)—The pH of the rZPB/rZPC mixture was adjusted to 6.5 with 25 mm citrate, 25 mm phosphate, NaOH (pH 4.5). Jack bean α-mannosidase (Seikagaku Kogyo) dissolved in citrate/phosphate buffer was added to the rZPB/rZPC solution at 5 milliunits/μg of protein. Protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was added to the mixture, according to the manufacturer's protocol. After digestion at 37 °C for 9 h, the buffer was exchanged for PBS using Amicon Ultra-4 (Millipore) spin filters. Aliquots (0.5 μg) of the digests were electrophoresed on SDS gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were then subjected to lectin blotting with GNA or to immunoblotting with anti-porcine ZPB antibody. Control (sham) digestions were performed, as above, except that citrate/phosphate buffer was used in place of α-mannosidase. To investigate the effect of α-mannosidase itself on sperm-zona binding, an α-mannosidase digestion reaction was carried out in the absence of rZPB/rZPC and then used in competitive inhibition assays. Sperm-Agarose Bead Binding Assay—The fraction that was eluted from the His-Bind resin by washing with 60 mm imidazole was incubated with S protein-agarose, as described above. As a control, the Sf9 cells were cultured without recombinant viruses; the culture supernatant was subjected to His-Bind column chromatography and then mixed with S protein-agarose. The agarose beads were washed with Brackett and Oliphant (BO) solution for the bovine sperm binding assay (27Yonezawa N. Fukui N. Kuno M. Shinoda M. Goko S. Mitsui S. Nakano M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 40Brackett B.G. Oliphant G. Biol. Reprod. 1975; 12: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar) or with modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution for the porcine sperm binding assay (24Noguchi S. Hatanaka Y. Tobita T. Nakano M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 41Toyoda Y. Chang M.C. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1974; 36: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Frozen bovine sperm were thawed and washed twice in BO solution without BSA, which was prewarmed to 38.5 °C. The bovine sperm were then capacitated by incubating the sperm in BO solution that contained BSA for 30 min at 38.5 °C in 2% CO2. The sperm concentration was calculated from a standard curve of percentage transmittance at 400 nm versus cells/ml, which was determined by hemacytometer counting of the sperm. About 20 beads that were coated with each recombinant protein were transferred to BO solution that contained BSA for one assay, and bovine sperm were then added to the solution to give a final density of 2.0 × 106 cells/ml. After a 2-h incubation at 38.5 °C in 2% CO2, the beads were transferred to fresh BO solution that contained BSA using a siliconized pipette with a bore size of ∼1.2 times the diameter of the beads. The beads were then transferred to PBS that contained 3% glutaraldehyde and fixed for 40 min at room temperature. To visualize the sperm that were bound to the beads, the beads were transferred to PBS that contained 10 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Finally, the beads were transferred onto slide glasses and covered with cover glasses. The sperm that bound to the beads were counted under the fluorescence microscope. This assay was repeated at least three times for each recombinant protein, to ensure the reproducibility. For the assays of frozen and freshly ejaculated porcine sperm, modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution was used instead of BO solution, and the incubation was performed at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Competitive Inhibition Assay—Solubilized bovine zona (0.1 μg/50 μl PBS) was added to each well of a 96-well plate (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, NY), which was then incubated at 4 °C overnight. After rinsing with PBS, the wells were blocked with 3% BSA in TBS at 37 °C for 2 h. Frozen bovine sperm were washed and capacitated as described above, and 50-μl aliquots (2 × 105 sperm) were incubated with the solubilized bovine zona or each recombinant for 30 min at 38.5 °C in 2% CO2. The amount of inhibitor was adjusted to 0.2 μg. The wells were rinsed three times with PBS, and the preincubated sperm solutions were transferred into the wells. After incubation for 2 h at 38.5 °C in 2% CO2, the wells were washed three times with BO solution. PBS (50 μl) was added to each well, and the sperm that were bound to the wells were recovered by pipetting vigorously 20 times. The number of sperm in 0.1 μl of the suspension was counted using a hemacytometer. For the assay of frozen porcine sperm, wells were coated with solubilized porcine zona, modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution was used instead of BO solution, and incubation of sperm was performed at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Indirect Immunofluorescence Staining of Sperm-binding rZPGs— The frozen bovine sperm were washed and capacitated as described above. Sperm (50-μl aliquots of 2 × 106/ml) were incubated with solubilized bovine zona (0.2 μg) or each of the recombinant proteins (0.2 μg) in BO solution for 30 min at 38.5 °C in 2% CO2. The sperm were washed three times with BO solution, followed each time by centrifugation. The sperm were suspended in PBS and transferred to cover glasses. The sperm were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. After rinsing with PBS, the cover glasses were blocked with 3% BSA in TBS for 30 min at 37 °C. The proteins that bound to sperm were detected using the mixture of anti-porcine ZPA antibody (1/100 diluted), anti-porcine ZPB antibody (1/1,000 diluted), and anti-porcine ZPC antibody (1/1,000 diluted) as the primary antibodies, and fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1/1,000 diluted; Wako Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) as the secondary antibody. The sperm were observed under a fluorescence microscope. Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Carbohydrate Chains—rZPB was purified from the culture supernatant, as described above. The rZPB (40 μg) was desalted by dialysis against water and then lyophilized. The release of N-linked carbohydrate chains was performed by hydrazinolysis (24Noguchi S. Hatanaka Y. Tobita T. Nakano M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and the carbohydrate chains were fluorescently labeled with 2-aminopyridine, as described previously (24Noguchi S. Hatanaka Y. Tobita T. Nakano M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of the pyridylaminated carbohydrate chains were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) using Voyager-DE STR (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as the matrix. Statistical Analysis—The Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine whether the data on sperm binding to the recombinant proteinbeads were significantly different from the data on sperm binding to the control beads, as described above (i.e. p < 0.05). Welch's t test was applied to determine whether the levels of sperm binding to the rZPB-beads were significantly different from the levels of sperm binding to the rZPB/rZPC-beads (i.e. p < 0.05). Welch's t test was also applied to determine whether the rZPGs had significant inhibitory activity for sperm-zona binding (i.e. p < 0.05) and to determine whether the inhibitory activities were significantly different among rZPB alone, the rZPB/rZPC, and the rZPB mutant/rZPC mixture (i.e. p < 0.05). Expression of Recombinant Porcine Proteins rZPA, rZPB, and rZPC in Insect Cells Infected with Recombinant Baculoviruses—ZPGs are synthesized as membrane proteins, processed N-terminal to their transmembrane regions, and then secreted as mature polypeptides without their transmembrane regions (42Williams Z.

IntroductionThe plant cell wall comprises the most abundant source of organic carbon on the planet. This extensive resource is made available to the biosphere through the action of microbial glycoside hydrolases, which are thus of considerable biological and industrial importance. Plant cells are surrounded by an intimate network of polysaccharides that are highly inaccessible to enzyme attack (1Brett C.T. Waldron K. Physiology and Biochemistry of Plant Cell Walls. Chapman and Hall, London1996: 4-64Google Scholar). Glycoside hydrolases that attack the plant cell wall frequently display a modular structure in which non-catalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) 1The abbreviations used are: CBM, carbohydrate-binding module; AGE, affinity gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CGM, Carob galactomannan; HEC, hydroxyethyl cellulose; hvKGM, Konjac high viscosity glucomannan; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; lvKGM, Konjac low viscosity glucomannan. target the biocatalysts to specific polysaccharides (for review, see Ref. 2Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). By bringing the enzymes into intimate and prolonged contact with their recalcitrant substrate, CBMs potentiate the activity of glycoside hydrolases against the plant cell wall and therefore play a pivotal role in the saccharification of plant tissue by these enzymes (3Bolam D.N.

Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Engineering. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1999: 3-12Google Scholar), which may be found in the continuously updated carbohydrate-active enzyme data base at afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/. Virtually all CBMs characterized to date are β-stranded proteins arranged in what some term a “jelly-roll” motif. CBMs have also been grouped into three types based on the topology of the binding sites, which reflects the macromolecular structure of the target ligand (2Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J.

There is, therefore, considerable variation in ligand specificity within specific CBM Type B families (for example, Refs. 12Boraston A.B. Nurizzo D. Notenboom V. Ducros V. Rose D.R. Kilburn D.G.

Gilbert H.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5700-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The importance of direct hydrogen bonds is less clear. Polysaccharide binding by Type A CBMs is driven by the entropically favorable release of water from the ligand surface (29Creagh A.L. Ong E. Jervis E. Kilburn D.G. Haynes C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12229-12234Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and direct hydrogen bonds do not appear to make a significant contribution to ligand recognition (23Linder M. Mattinen M.L.

In Type B modules, however, binding is enthalpically driven, and mutagenesis studies suggest that direct hydrogen bonds play an important role in saccharide binding (for example, Refs. 16Czjzek M.

Although, in some cases indirect (water-mediated) hydrogen bonds appear to play a role in the binding of lectins to their ligands (31Ravishankar R. Ravindran M. Suguna K. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Curr. Sci. India. 1997; 72: 855-861Google Scholar, 32Ravishankar R. Suguna K. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 1375-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 33Loris R. Hamelryck T. Bouckaert J. Wyns L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 9-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), the importance of these solvent-mediated interactions in polysaccharide recognition by CBMs is unclear.Family 29 contains just two members, termed CBM29-1 and CBM29-2, which are components of the Piromyces equi non-catalytic protein NCP1 (34Freelove A.C. Bolam D.N. White P. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43010-43017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). NCP1 is present in the large, highly efficient, extracellular multienzyme plant cell wall-degrading complex produced by this anaerobic fungus. Both of the CBM29 modules bind to a range of β-1,4-linked polysaccharides that include cellulose, xylan, mannan, and glucomannan, although CBM29-1 displays lower affinity for these ligands than CBM29-2. Such flexible ligand recognition targets the anaerobic fungal complex to a range of different components of the plant cell wall and thus plays a pivotal role in the highly efficient degradation of this composite structure by the microbial eukaryote. We described, previously, the crystal structure of CBM29-2 in complex with cellohexaose and mannohexaose (15Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Nurizzo D. Szabo L. McKie V.A. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14077-14082Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although these structures revealed an open ligand binding cleft providing six sugar binding subsites, they left unanswered questions concerning the structural basis for the difference in affinity between the two family 29 modules and the functional importance of direct and indirect interactions between CBM29-2 and its ligands, particularly with respect to the importance of O2 (which is axial in mannose and equatorial in glucose) as a specificity determinant.Here we report the crystal structure of CBM29-1 and, by comparison with CBM29-2, provide insight into the structural basis for the different affinities displayed by the two family 29 modules. A mutagenesis approach to interrogate the functional importance of direct and indirect interactions between CBM29-2 and its ligands shows that hydrophobic stacking between aromatic residues and sugar rings dominates the binding affinity, as seen for other Type A and Type B CBMs. Although direct hydrogen bonds between specific amino acids in CBM29-2 and the hydroxyl groups of the sugar ligands make a significant contribution to overall affinity, the interactions between the protein and either the axial or equatorial O2 of mannose and glucose, respectively, contribute little to the overall binding energy. In contrast with studies on some lectins, we show that water-mediated hydrogen bonds contribute very little to ligand recognition by CBM29.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Culture ConditionsThe Escherichia coli strains used in this study were BL21(DE3): pLysS and Origami B:pLysS (Novagen). The plasmids employed in this work were recombinants of the expression vector pET22b (Novagen) encoding CBM29-2 (pVM1), and CBM29-1 (pVM2), which were constructed previously (15Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Nurizzo D. Szabo L. McKie V.A. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14077-14082Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 34Freelove A.C. Bolam D.N. White P.

CBM29-1 and CBM29-2, which comprise residues 174–317 and 336–479, respectively of P. equi NCP1, each contain a C-terminal His6 tag (15Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Nurizzo D. Szabo L. McKie V.A. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14077-14082Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). E. coli was cultured in Luria-Bertoni broth liquid media at 37 °C and 180 rpm unless otherwise stated. When culturing strains that harbor the pET-based recombinant plasmids, media were supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin.Generation of Mutants of CBM29-1 and CBM29-2Derivatives of the two CBMs were generated by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using pVM1 and pVM2 as template DNA. The primers employed in the mutagenesis PCRs are shown in Table 1S. The complete sequences of the DNA encoding the CBM29 mutants were determined by MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany) using T7 forward and reverse primers to confirm that only the desired mutations had been introduced.Expression and Purification of CBM29-1 and CBM29-2CBM29-2 was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3):pLysS as described previously (15Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Nurizzo D. Szabo L. McKie V.A. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14077-14082Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 34Freelove A.C. Bolam D.N. White P. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43010-43017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); CBM29-1 was produced in E. coli Origami B:pLysS. Briefly, cells were cultured in 1 liter of Luria-Bertoni broth in 2-liter baffled flasks at 30 °C and 180 rpm to an A600 ~0.6. Recombinant protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 200 μm and incubation at 16 °C for 16 h. CBM29-2 was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography using Talon resin (Clontech), anion exchange, and size exclusion chromatography as described by Charnock et al. (15Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Nurizzo D. Szabo L. McKie V.A. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14077-14082Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). CBM29-1 was purified using the same procedure as for CBM29-2 except that the protein was eluted from the Talon resin with 5 mm rather than 100 mm imidazole. The CBMs were all purified to electrophoretic homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE. The protein concentration was determined from the calculated molar extinction coefficient of CBM29-1 and CBM29-2 at 280 nm, which were 26,860 and 26,150 m–1 cm–1, respectively, and reduced coefficients of 20,340 and 25,560 m–1 cm–1 were used for the CBM29-2 tryptophan and tyrosine mutants, respectively.Ligand Binding StudiesLigand binding was determined by both affinity gel electrophoresis (AGE) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). AGE was performed as described previously (34Freelove A.C. Bolam D.N. White P. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43010-43017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using Konjac high viscosity glucomannan (hvKGM), Carob galactomannan (CGM), and hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), which were purchased from Megazyme International (Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland). The polysaccharides were included in the gels at concentrations ranging from 0.125 to 10 mg/ml. Kd values were calculated by determining the mobility of the CBM, in the presence and absence of ligand, relative to a nonbinding standard BSA (Sigma) as originally described by Takeo (35Takeo K. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 187-193Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). ITC measurements were made at 25 and 10 °C following standard procedures (36Flint J. Nurizzo D. Harding S.E. Longman E. Davies G.J. Gilbert H.J. Bolam D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using a Microcal Omega titration calorimeter. Proteins were dialyzed, extensively, against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and the ligand was dissolved in the same buffer to minimize heats of dilution. During a titration experiment the protein sample (100–800 μm), stirred at 300 rpm in a 1.4331-ml reaction cell maintained at 25 or 10 °C, was injected with 25 successive 10-μl aliquots of ligand comprising 20 mg/ml low viscosity KGM (lvKGM) at 200-s intervals. The molar concentration of CBM29-2 binding sites present in the glucomannan was determined as described previously (37Szabo L. Jamal S. Xie H. Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49061-49065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Integrated heat effects, after correction for heats of dilution, were analyzed by nonlinear regression using a single site binding model (Microcal Origin, version 5.0). The fitted data yield the association constant (Ka) and the enthalpy of binding (ΔH). Other thermodynamic parameters were calculated using the standard thermodynamic equation. −RTlnKa=ΔG=ΔH−TΔS(Eq. 1) NMR SpectroscopyTo assess the structural integrity of the mutant proteins, one-dimensional NMR analysis was performed on immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography-purified wild type and mutant forms of CBM29-2. Protein samples were ~500 μm in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 10% D2O. NMR spectra were recorded at 30 °C on a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer, and 1H chemical shifts were referenced to an internal standard of 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate-2,2,3,3-d4 at 0.00 ppm. Data were processed by FELIX (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego).Crystallization of CBM29Wild type CBM29-1 and CBM29-2 mutants were screened for crystallization with the Clear Strategy Screen (38Brzozowski A.M. Walton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 97-101Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar) at 20 °C with a protein concentration of 10–20 mg/ml. Tetragonal bipyramidal crystals of uncomplexed CBM29-2 mutants were obtained after 2 days from drops that comprised 2 μl of the CBM29-2 mutants Y46A, R112A, or D114A at 10 mg/ml and 1 μl of 100 mm Na/HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm KSCN, 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol, and 16–21% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350. CBM29-2 D83A in complex with mannohexaose was crystallized at 10 mg/ml in 1.5 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 6.5, and with 10 mm mannohexaose (25% glycerol was subsequently included in the stabilizing solution as a cryoprotectant). The CBM29-2 K74A, with cellohexaose, was crystallized in 0.18 m ammonium tartrate, 18% polyethylene glycol 3350, 25% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 5% glycerol, 10 mm cellohexaose (and the same liquor used as a cryoprotectant). Unliganded CBM29-1 was crystallized at 10 mg/ml in 0.6 m lithium acetate 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, pH 7.8, and grown at 20 °C for 6 weeks producing amorphous crystals. Freshly prepared drops were then streak-seeded from crushed amorphous crystals to yield more regular crystals after 2 weeks. Crystals were then harvested into a cryoprotectant mother liquor containing an additional 25% glycerol. Crystals of CBM29-1 in the presence of 5 mm cellohexaose were obtained, after 4 weeks, in drops comprising 10 mg/ml protein in 0.2 m lithium chloride, 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, pH 6.7. 25% glycerol was added to the mother liquor for subsequent freezing.Data Collection and Structure ResolutionCBM29-2 Mutants—Data were collected, to between 2.25 and 1.6 Å resolution, on beamline ID14-EH1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble (France) and beamline PX9.6 at the Daresbury (UK) Synchrotron Radiation Source. Crystals all belong to the orthorhombic space group P43212. Crystal data and final refinement statistics are reported in Table I. Data were processed and scaled using MOSFLM and SCALA from the CCP4 suite (39Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) using the wild type CBM29-2 structure, in the absence of ligand (1GWK), as the search model. After molecular replacement, maximum likelihood-based refinement of the atomic positions and temperature factors were performed with REFMAC (42Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr.

https://openalex.org/W1997077414,"We have investigated the mechanism of the translation of the second open reading frame (ORF) of the respiratory syncytial virus M2 transcript that uses a novel coupled translation process requiring prior translation of the upstream ORF. The second M2-2 ORF sequences play no role in the coupling process and can be replaced with other gene sequences. Surprisingly, the overlap region of the two ORFs alone was not sufficient for coupled translation to occur. An analysis of the sequences required for the coupling process showed that portions of the transcript located along the length of the first ORF M2-1, upstream of the ORF overlap region, were essential for coupled translation to occur. A critically important region for this process was centered ∼150 nucleotides upstream of the ORF2 initiation codons. This region was shown to contain a significant degree of secondary structure, and mutation of this sequence to remove predicted areas of base pairing significantly reduced coupled translation, confirming that the secondary structure was important for the coupling process. Additional sequences further upstream increased the efficiency of the coupled translation process. These data indicate that upstream sequences act in conjunction with the M2-1/M2-2 overlap region to promote coupled translation.

It has long been recognized that mRNA is a central molecule in the parasitic interaction of a virus with its host (1Baltimore D. Bacteriol. Rev. 1971; 35: 235-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Throughout an infection, viruses must rely on the translational apparatus of the host cell for expression of their genes. The study of translation of virus mRNA has identified many previously unknown processes used in their attempts to ensure selective translation of their own mRNA in the presence of large amounts of host mRNA. In addition, many viruses have been shown to encode more than one protein from an individual transcript, possibly in response to the pressure to maximize the coding capacity of the genome without generating additional energetic “strain” on the system that would arise by encoding a separate mRNA or because of other size/packaging constraints on the genome. Several of these strategies have subsequently been shown to be utilized by the host. Many of these novel processes are at the stage of initiation of translation. In the conventional translation mechanism, the initiation event involves the binding of the 40 S ribosome subunit with eukaryotic initiation factors, GTP, and Met-tRNAi to a 5′-terminal cap structure on the mRNA followed by scanning movement in the 3′ direction (2Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Lomakin I.B. Pilipenko E.V. Shatsky I.N. Agol V.I. Hellen C.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7029-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). When the first AUG initiation codon is encountered, eukaryotic initiation factor 5B facilitates the binding of the 60 S ribosomal subunit and translation ensues following the release of all of the initiation factors and acquisition of elongation factors. If the sequence surrounding the first AUG is not favorable, the ribosome may scan past and initiate at the next AUG (3Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). Several viruses, most notably members of the family Paramyxoviridae, have utilized this action of leaky scanning to direct translation of additional protein(s) from a single mRNA. This is seen clearly in the case of Sendai virus for translation of the mRNA, which encodes the virus phosphoprotein. The open reading frame (ORF), 1The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; RHDV, rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; RT, reverse transcriptase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RRL, rabbit reticulocyte lysate; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. which encodes the phosphoprotein, is initiated by an AUG codon in a suboptimal sequence context, and a proportion of the ribosomes, which have bound to the mRNA, continues scanning until they encounter the codon that directs synthesis of the C protein and which is in a good context for translation initiation. The same Sendai virus phosphoprotein mRNA also encodes two additional proteins, Y1 and Y2, by using a “ribosomal shunting” process in which the ribosome, instead of scanning in a progressive manner along the mRNA, is directed to the Y1 and Y2 initiation codons (4Latorre P. Kolakofsky D. Curran J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5021-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A similar process has also been shown to be used by certain cellular mRNAs. Picornaviruses, which lack the 5′-cap structure on their genomic/mRNA, direct translation initiation by virtue of the presence of a structural feature in the nucleic acid, the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (5Jang S.K. Krausslich H.G. Nicklin M.J. Duke G.M. Palmenberg A.C. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2636-2643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). Ribosomes bind directly to the IRES and initiate translation at a downstream AUG codon. Since their discovery in picornaviruses, IRES have been studied in many other viruses and examples have been found within cellular transcripts (7Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Pseudoknots are an additional example where a structural feature of viral mRNA directs translation of an alternative ORF. Here the secondary structures formed within the mRNA causes the ribosome to pause, which in some instances leads to a –1 frameshift to generate a protein with an alternative C terminus (8Plant E.P.

A novel process of translational control has been described for human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the calicivirus rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV). RSV is the major cause of hospital admissions of very young children for respiratory disease worldwide (9Gardner P.S. Postgrad. Med.

RHDV is responsible for acute disease in wild rabbits and is closely related to human calicivirus, which causes significant gastrointestinal disease (12Green K.Y. Ando T. Balayan M.S. Berke T.

RSV encodes an mRNA that directs the synthesis of a transcriptional regulator (M2-1) protein (13Collins P.L. Hill M.G. Cristina J. Grosfeld H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The mRNA contains a second ORF, which directs the synthesis of the M2-2 protein that is also involved in control of virus RNA synthesis (14Ahmadian G. Chambers P. Easton A.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2011-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Bermingham A. Collins P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The first and second ORFs of the M2 mRNA overlap by 32 nucleotides (Fig. 1A), and Ahmadian et al. (17Ahmadian G. Randhawa J.S. Easton A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2681-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) show that initiation of translation of the second, M2-2, ORF was coupled to termination of translation of the first ORF as moving the translational stop codon of the M2-1 ORF further downstream abrogated translation of the second ORF. A similar phenomenon was described for the subgenomic mRNA found in RHDV-infected cells where translation of ORF3 of the genome is coupled to termination of translation of the upstream ORF (18Meyers G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34051-34060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In both cases, it was shown that the nucleotide sequence of the second downstream ORF was not essential for the process to occur because the virus ORF could be replaced with other sequences without an effect on the coupled translation (17Ahmadian G. Randhawa J.S. Easton A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2681-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Meyers G. J. Biol.

For the RSV study, the gene encoding bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) was substituted for the M2-2 gene (Fig. 1B) (17Ahmadian G. Randhawa J.S. Easton A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2681-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Meyers (18Meyers G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34051-34060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) has shown that the translation of the downstream ORF of RHDV subgenomic mRNA is dependent on a sequence located 84 nucleotides upstream of the region of overlap between the two ORFs. The sequence was shown not to function as an IRES, but the mechanism by which it operated was not determined. Here we describe an analysis of the coupled translation of the RSV M2 mRNA ORFs and demonstrate that this process requires as a minimum a sequence ∼150 nucleotides upstream of the ORF overlap region. In addition, we show that the sequence contains a strong secondary structure feature, which is retained in the presence or absence of ribosomes. Plasmid Construction—All of the PCR reactions were carried out using PfuTurbo Hotstart DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), and resulting constructs were then sequenced.

This product was then cloned downstream of the RSV M2-1 ORF in-frame with the three internal start codons of M2-2 in the vector pBlueScribe (Stratagene) generating the plasmid pWildEGFP (Fig. 1C). EGFP-M2-CAT Fusion Mutants—The EGFP ORF was amplified from pEGFP using the primers GFP N terminus and GFP C terminus. Amplification with GFP C terminus removes the stop codon from EGFP and incorporates a SphI restriction site so that the overlap sequence from M2-1 ORF can be cloned in-frame and the M2-1 stop codon within the overlap is utilized. This PCR product was digested with KpnI and SphI. Primers C28 and pBS-SphImut were then used to amplify the M2 overlap sequence and the CAT ORF (cloned in-frame with the M2-2 start codons in the M2 overlap region) from pWildCAT (Fig. 2A). This PCR product was digested with SphI and HindIII and ligated along with the digested EGFP PCR product into pBS digested with KpnI and HindIII to generate pC28 (Fig. 1D). To generate the remaining EGFP-M2-CAT constructs, pC28 was digested with SphI and HindIII and the 3917-bp fragment containing the vector backbone and the EGFP ORF was purified. Individual primers were then designed (Fig. 2A and Table I), which incorporated a SphI restriction site to anneal at designated points throughout M2-1. Consequently, when using pWildCAT as the template with the M2-1-specific primer and pBS-SphImut, a designated portion of M2-1 and the CAT ORF was amplified (Fig. 2A). These various sized M2-1-CAT products were digested with SphI and HindIII and cloned into the 3917-bp fragment so that they could be positioned downstream of EGFP. The nomenclature of the constructs was based on the number of nucleotides from the C terminus of M2-1 cloned onto the C terminus of GFP (not including the SphI site). pWildCAT Mutants—The 5′ terminus of the M2-1 gene was amplified with primers T7 and WCSphIA or T7 and WCSphIB. These products were individually ligated to the PCR product generated using primers C28 and pBS-SphImut, which contains the remainder of the 3′ end of the M2-1 ORF and the CAT ORF, and inserted back into pBS. Primer Extensions and Toeprinting Assays—Toeprinting assays were carried out as described by Gould et al. (19Gould P.S. Bird H. Easton A.J. BioTechniques. 2005; 38: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Primer extensions were conducted by eliminating the in vitro translation step of the toeprinting assay (19Gould P.S. Bird H. Easton A.J. BioTechniques. 2005; 38: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, the mRNA was synthesized in vitro and then the FAM-labeled primer was annealed to the template, which was immediately added to the reverse transcription reaction carried out at 25, 37, 42, or 45 °C and analyzed using the GeneScan software as described previously (19Gould P.S. Bird H. Easton A.J. BioTechniques. 2005; 38: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Transfection and Reporter Assays—HEp-2 cells were transfected as described previously (17Ahmadian G. Randhawa J.S. Easton A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2681-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA added to each well was reduced to 250 ng, and the transfection reagent Lipofectin (Invitrogen) was used as recommended. CAT protein expression was measured using anti-CAT-coated plates and recommended components (Roche Applied Science) for each plasmid in duplicate with the exception of pWildCAT where 4-well replicates were used. The levels of CAT expressed from pWildCAT (set at 100%) was used to normalize expression between experiments. The data shown are the average from at least three repeats. EGFP ELISA Protocol—Protein extracts were diluted in 10 mg/ml blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science) and incubated for 1 h in anti-GFP plates (Perbio Science, Cramlington, United Kingdom). Plates were washed five times with PBS-T (0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma, Poole, United Kingdom)). Ab290 rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP primary antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) diluted 1/16000 in blocking reagent was added for 1 h. Following a wash step, goat anti-rabbit HRP (Bio-Rad) (1/10,000 in dilution reagent) then was added and incubated for 1 h. The plates were washed again, and ABTS substrate (Sigma) was added before measuring the optical density at 405 nm. Purified EGFP used for standards was obtained from Clontech. Coupled Translation of Non-RSV Proteins—The construct pWildCAT shown in Fig. 1B contains the entire coding sequence of the M2-1 ORF (17Ahmadian G. Randhawa J.S. Easton A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2681-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Immediately downstream of the M2-1 stop codon, an XbaI site was used to fuse the CAT reporter gene in-frame with the three start codons for the M2-2 ORF that were present upstream of the M2-1 stop codon. We have shown that the CAT reporter gene, which replaced the M2-2 coding sequence after the M2-1 stop codon, can be expressed in vivo from pWildCAT (17Ahmadian G. Randhawa J.S. Easton A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2681-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To examine whether a protein other than CAT could replace the M2-2 ORF, we cloned the EGFP ORF in-frame with the three start codons of the M2-2 ORF in a manner identical to that of CAT gene (Fig. 1C). The EGFP gene was chosen, because it has a much higher G + C content (61.5%) than CAT (44.9%) and M2-2 (28.6%), which may affect expression, and the gene product is easy to assay in a quantitative ELISA used in our laboratory. The data showed that expression levels of EGFP from pWildEGFP were similar to those of CAT from pWildCAT (data not shown). Thus, it appears that the sequence of the second ORF following the overlap region does not play a role in coupled expression. To define the minimal parameters that enable coupled translation of the two M2 ORFs to occur, we attempted to co-express two heterologous proteins from the same mRNA transcript. To recreate the same physical arrangement as that seen in the RSV M2 transcript, the coding sequence for EGFP was inserted in place of the M2-1 ORF in pWildCAT, creating an EGFP/CAT dicistronic mRNA. However, the M2-1/M2-2 overlap region was retained so that the stop codon of the first ORF (EGFP) was positioned downstream of the start codons of the second ORF (CAT) constructing plasmid pC28 (Figs. 1D and 2A). The sequence of the overlapping region was identical to the M2 overlap with the exception of one mutation around AUG1 where the SphI site had been introduced for cloning purposes (plasmid pC28, Fig. 1D). pC28 was transfected into vaccinia vTF7.3-infected HEp2 cells and the expression of CAT protein was measured (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2B shows that no CAT could be detected from pC28. The transfection and expression system was functioning as the product of the first ORF, EGFP, was detected (data not shown). Furthermore, the positive control pC580, which contained EGFP fused to almost all of the M2-1 ORF with the exception of the first 4 nucleotides from the 5′ end, when transfected into cells expressed CAT protein to a level similar as that measured in pWildCAT (Fig. 2, A and B). To ensure that introducing a mutation within the overlap sequence in pC28 (Fig. 1D) by inserting the SphI site around the first start codon was not interfering with the coupled mechanism, the plasmid pC79 was constructed (Fig. 2A). pC79 contained 79 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the M2-1 ORF fused in between the EGFP and CAT ORFs, and in this plasmid, the sequences in the immediate vicinity of the overlap region are the same as those in the M2 mRNA. Quantifying the levels of expression of CAT from pC79 also enabled the role of the 47 nucleotides directly upstream of the overlap to be investigated. Unexpectedly, even with these additional sequences, it was still not possible to detect coupled translation of CAT protein, although EGFP was produced (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the sequence representing the last 79 nucleotides of M2-1 were not sufficient alone to couple translation even with a fully conserved overlap sequence. These data together with the observation that coupled translation of EGFP and CAT ORFs does occur if the entire M2-1 ORF is fused in the correct frame between the two ORFs (pC580 Fig. 2B) indicate that sequences in the main body of the M2-1 ORF are required for coupled translation. A series of additional plasmids were constructed in a systematic manner to contain increasing lengths of sequence from the 3′ end of M2-1 ORF inserted between the EGFP and CAT ORFs to determine the minimal length of sequence required for coupled translation (Fig. 2A). In particular, we focused in detail using 6-nucleotide increments on an area of the M2-1 ORF 142–160 nucleotides upstream from the stop codon (Fig. 2C). Each of these plasmids was transfected into HEp2 cells infected with vaccinia vTF7.3, and CAT protein expression was measured (Fig. 2B). The data showed that, to obtain a detectable level of CAT protein, at least 148 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the M2-1 ORF were required (plasmid pC148). CAT expression could not be detected in the construct pC142, which contained just 6 nucleotides (CCATCT) less than pC148. Indeed, the SphI site used in the cloning process matched 3 of the 6 nucleotides absent in pC142 (Fig. 2C). A significant rise in CAT expression was also noted between the mutants pC181 and pC202 (Fig. 2, A and B). The levels of CAT expression then began to plateau between constructs pC202 and pC484 with a further small increase seen between pC484 and pC532. Whereas the difference in expression between pC484 and pC532 is not statistically significant, the consistently observed rise may suggest that this region has a minor role in coupled translation. The level of EGFP expression was also measured from each construct in an ELISA. This showed that there was an apparent decrease in the amounts of EGFP detected, which correlated with the length of M2-1 gene present (data not shown). This is most likely to be to the case because, as the fusion protein increases in size with longer lengths of M2-1 fused to EGFP, the ELISA is no longer detecting the proteins with equal efficiency, giving an untrue impression of a reduction in protein production from ORF1. The effect of replacing the 6 nucleotides shown to be required for coupled translation in the EGFP-M2-CAT constructs with the SphI site in pWildCAT (Fig. 2C, pWildCAT-SA) was investigated. An additional mutant was also constructed in which the SphI site was inserted as additional 6 nucleotides within this region (Fig. 2C, pWildCAT-SB). CAT expression was measured and showed that either the direct replacement or the insertion of the SphI restriction site in pWildCAT at this position caused a significant decrease in coupled expression (Fig. 2B), suggesting an important role for this region of the M2-1 ORF in the coupled translation process. M2-1 RNA Analysis—To investigate the mechanism(s) that leads to the ribosomes re-initiating at the second ORF, we carried out a primer extension inhibition (toeprinting) assay that could be used to determine the position of ribosomes along mRNA (20Anthony D.D. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1554-1562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hartz D. McPheeters D.S. Traut R. Gold L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 22Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4853-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Toeprinting has been used previously to study the interactions of ribosomal components on IRES sequences (23Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 24Pisarev A.V. Chard L.S. Kaku Y. Johns H.L. Shatsky I.N. Belsham G.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4487-4497Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The assay works by translating mRNA in vitro with rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRLs). When cycloheximide is added to the reaction, elongation is blocked, marking the position of the ribosomes on the transcript. The mRNA/RRL complex is then copied into cDNA using a labeled primer, and where the reverse transcriptase (RT) meets the ribosome bound to the mRNA, polymerization is halted, generating a fragment of a designated size. If the positioning of ribosomes is not random and instead the ribosomes are clustered at a specific point on the mRNA, a “toeprint” fragment is generated. The two M2 ORFs were first synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase by linearizing plasmid pRS22K with HindIII (Fig. 1A). An mRNA fragment of 956 nucleotides representing the full-length transcript was obtained (Fig. 3, lane 2). However, an additional band of 562 nucleotides was also always seen. This second band represents premature termination of the T7 polymerase within the M2-1 ORF, because transcription of pRS22K linearized with NdeI, which cuts upstream of the HindIII site in the M2-2 ORF, still results in the 562-nucleotide band (Fig. 3, lane 3). Premature termination was again seen when the M2-1 ORF was re-cloned downstream of the bacteriophage T3 promoter in pBC(SK+) (Stratagene) (Fig. 3, lane 4). However, when plasmid pRS22K was linearized with KpnI and RNA was synthesized with the T3 RNA polymerase (which uses the coding strand as the template), there was no evidence for premature termination (Fig. 3, lane 5). It was possible to use the mixed mRNA species in the toeprinting assay, because the primer does not anneal to the smaller fragment. However, the significance of the presence of the prematurely terminated transcription product is discussed below. The mRNA synthesized in vitro from pRS22K digested with HindIII was used in a toeprinting assay. The primer M2toe1 (Table I) was annealed to the mRNA and added to in vitro translation reaction mixture with RRL. Areas where the ribosomes paused on the mRNA transcript would be represented as peaks on the resulting electropherogram, because further progression of the RT is inhibited (19Gould P.S. Bird H. Easton A.J. BioTechniques. 2005; 38: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As a control, the same mRNA/primer mixture was added to the translation reaction mixture but with no RRL present. This control indicates the regions within the mRNA that causes the RT polymerase to pause, presumably due to regions of strong secondary structure. Identical electropherograms were seen in the presence or absence of RRL in a toeprinting assay with the RT step carried out at 37 °C (Fig. 4A). The traces showed the distinctive pattern of a series of peaks with one region having a broad shape that slopes away from an initial pinnacle. A sharper peak of 201 nucleotides also appeared. The intensity of this peak varied between repeat experiments. Because these peaks are present when no RRLs are added, they must represent regions in the RNA strong in secondary structure that cause the RT polymerase to pause or fall from the transcript, even in the absence of ribosomes. The sizes of the peaks were determined based on the ROX size standards added to each reaction (orange peaks, Fig. 4). However, it is known that the ROX standards undersize the fragments by 2–3 nucleotides so the traces were aligned with a sequencing ladder generated using the same primer (19Gould P.S. Bird H. Easton A.J. BioTechniques. 2005; 38: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). When the sequencing reactions were assembled, indistinguishable regions where termination had occurred independently of the ddNTP present matched those identified in the toeprinting assay (Fig. 4B). The primer extension reactions were also repeated at 42 and 45 °C, and identical results were found (data not shown), suggesting again that these areas of secondary structure are stable. The position of the 3′ end of the broad peak determined from the sequence data were 137–138 nucleotides upstream of the M2-1 stop codon. This is in very close proximity to the minimal region of the M2-1 ORF required for coupled translation to occur as identified in Fig. 2. Therefore, we analyzed the plasmids pC580, pC148, and pC142 in the primer extension assay to determine whether the broad peak was present. Interestingly, when mRNA was synthesized in vitro from these plasmids, the smaller fragment representing premature termination was only found in pC580 and pC148 (Fig. 3, lanes 7–10). Because the second ORF in these constructs was the CAT ORF and not M2-2, the primer CAT2 (Table I) was used for the RT reaction. The position of the broad peak was 329 nucleotides from the 5′ end of CAT2 as seen for pC580 (Fig. 5A). However, the broad peak was not present in pC142, which also cannot couple translation. The 3′ end of the broad peak differs by 1 nucleotide between pC148 and pC580 with the other mutants tested falling between these two points in a pattern that is dependent on the length of M2-1 sequence present (data not shown). The absence of the broad peak in pC142 is predicted to be because the 6 nucleotides missing here, but present in pC148, are an essential component in the formation of any secondary structure. Further evidence supporting this was shown when the primer extension assays were carried out on the pWildCAT mutants generated that have the SphI restriction site inserted within this region (shown in Fig. 2C). Only mRNA synthesized from pWildCAT contained the premature termination fragment (Fig. 3, lanes 12–14) and generates the broad peak seen in the assay (Fig. 5B). Translation of the two ORFs in the RSV M2 mRNA has been shown to be coupled, with translation of the downstream, M2-2, ORF dependent on completion of translation of the upstream, M2-1, ORF (17Ahmadian G. Randhawa J.S. Easton A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2681-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Translation of the second ORF of the RSV M2 transcript is not dependent on the presence of an IRES sequence within M2-1, because it has previously been shown that translational termination at the first ORF is an essential for translation of the second ORF (17Ahmadian G. Randhawa J.S. Easton A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2681-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Coupled expression of three different ORFs, M2-2, CAT (14Ahmadian G. Chambers P. Easton A.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2011-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Ahmadian G. Randhawa J.S. Easton A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2681-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and EGFP, cloned downstream of the M2-1 ORF, has now been measured. These data show that the sequence of the second ORF after the M2-1 stop codon can be changed; therefore, the downstream region plays no direct role in the translational coupling process. It is noteworthy that the G+C content of the EGFP ORF contrasts starkly with that of the viral M2-2 ORF, indicating that this is also not a factor in the coupling process. Surprisingly, it was not possible to couple the expression of two heterologous ORFs encoding EGFP and CAT with just the M2 overlap sequence alone joining the two ORFs. To investigate whether additional sequences within the M2-1 ORF, together with the overlap region, were essential for coupled translation, a series of constructs were made that progressively increased the length of the M2-1 sequence between the EGFP and CAT ORFs. Expression from these constructs showed that at least 148 nucleotides from the 3′ end of M2-1 were essential for coupled translation to occur at all. However, even with these 148 nucleotides present, the levels of expression from the second ORF were reduced by 10-fold compared with those seen when the entire M2-1 ORF was present upstream of the overlap region, reflecting the situation in the normal M2 mRNA (Fig. 2B). The presence of 256 nucleotides from the 3′ terminus of the M2-1 ORF increased coupled translation levels to 82% of the “wild type.” Wild type levels of coupled translation were only achieved when 532 nucleotides of the M2-1 ORF were present. Thus, the majority of M2-1 ORF participates in the process of coupled translation, with some segments more important than others. This differs significantly from the findings for the RHDV calicivirus subgenomic mRNA where only 84 nucleotides of the sequence upstream of the overlap region recovered ∼90% wild type expression levels of ORF2 (18Meyers G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34051-34060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Following the original description of the coupling process, several mechanisms were proposed involving the possibility of ribosomes pausing within the overlap region so that a backward movement of the ribosome onto the start codon(s) of the second ORFs could occur (17Ahmadian G. Randhawa J.S. Easton A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2681-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Toeprinting assays carried out to determine the positions of ribosomes stalled along the M2-1 transcript did not detect evidence of an accumulation of stalled ribosomes within the overlap region. A striking feature of the toeprinting electropherograms was the presence of a broad peak with a 3′ position located 137 nucleotides from the stop codon of M2-1. The characteristic shape seen with this peak represents an area of ∼22 nucleotides. No differences were found in the electropherogram patterns in the presence or absence of ribosomes (Fig. 4A). Thus, the major peak seen represents the position where the elongation of the reverse transcriptase is inhibited by the intrinsic proprieties of the mRNA itself. These data indicate that there is a very high degree of secondary structure in a specific region within the M2 transcript where the RT pauses on or falls from the RNA template. cDNA synthesis can occasionally continue beyond this point in some individual reactions, because additional peaks were seen when samples were overloaded (data not shown). False priming was eliminated, because the main peaks were also seen using a different primer (Fig. 5). The same regions were also identified during the dideoxynucleotide sequencing reactions as being areas where extension with the polymerase was unable to process (Fig. 4B). The 3′ end of the broad peak was located in close proximity to the sequence shown by the EGFP-M2-CAT fusion analysis to be the minimal requirement for coupled translation to occur. A strong correlation can be seen between the presence of the broad peak in the toeprinting assay and coupled translation. For example, the peak was found with plasmid pC148 that can express CAT but was absent in plasmid pC142, which does not couple translation. However, it should be noted that, in these constructs, no additional upstream sequences from the M2-1 ORF were present. When M2 mRNA was synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase, a shorter transcript representing premature termination was always observed. This was most likely due to the region of stable secondary structure generating a prematurely terminated mRNA transcript. In contrast, with constructs lacking the region or structure, only a single mRNA transcript of the expected size was produced. While confirming the presence of a region of stable secondary structure, this raises questions regarding the efficiency of the RNA synthesis in the M2 gene during transcription and replication from the virus genome. When the M2 gene was cloned in the reverse orientation so that the coding stand was the template, premature termination did not occur. This would be analogous to the single-stranded genomic RSV RNA being synthesized from the positive sense antigenome template where premature termination would not be desirable. The program Mfold (25Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10412) Google Scholar) was used to generate a predicted structure of the mRNA in the vicinity of the region of strong secondary structure (Fig. 6). The program predicted a series of stem-loop structures in this region. The truncated M2-1 segment in plasmid pC142 would not be able to form this structure, because a significant proportion of the RNA sequence involved its formation is absent. The mutation of the secondary structure region to generate mutants pWildCAT-SA and pWildCAT-SB prevented the formation of the broad peak, representing the region of secondary structure, in the toeprinting assay (Fig. 5B). This is because the mutations in pWildCAT-SA would reduce the stability of the predicted stems I and III (Fig. 6) by eliminating the formation of three base pairings. In the case of pWildCAT-SB, an additional 6 nucleotides were inserted into stem I. However, coupled translation can still occur in these mutants, albeit at a significantly lower level than pWildCAT (Fig. 2B). The low level of coupled expression with these mutants is predicted to occur, because there may be partial destabilization of the structure and/or unlike the construct pC142 that also lacks the structured region. These constructs contain the full-length wild type upstream M2-1 sequences that have been shown in this study to also play an important role in the coupling process. The differences in the level of coupled translation seen with between pWildCAT-SA and pWildCAT-SB may be due to the different number of stems disrupted. Taken together, these data demonstrate the critical importance of the secondary structure in the ability of the mRNA to couple translation of the two ORFs. However, in interpreting these data, it should be borne in mind the 3′ terminus of the broad peak seen in the toeprinting assay was positioned within the predicted structure shown in Fig. 6. The reason for this is not clear, but it may indicate that the structural element involved is more complex than that generated by modeling. In conclusion, we have shown that the process of coupled translation of the M2 mRNA of RSV occurs by a novel mechanism. The data presented here indicate that the mechanism of the coupled translation process for the RSV M2 mRNA is not the result of a simple scanning by ribosomes after completion of translation of the upstream M2-1 ORF but requires structural features present in the mRNA. We have identified three sections of the M2-1 transcript that play a role in the coupling process: 1) the overlap sequence (17Ahmadian G. Randhawa J.S. Easton A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2681-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); 2) the region of ∼22 nucleotides in length and strong in secondary structure centered 150 nucleotides from the M2-1 stop codon; and 3) a larger less well defined region upstream that may extend to the start codon. In particular, the ability to couple translation is strongly associated with the region of strong secondary structure upstream of the overlap region, which also appears to affect in vitro transcription reactions. Further work is required to decipher the precise nature of the potential molecular interaction(s) in the upstream ORF, particularly between the sequences containing the secondary structure and the overlap sequence.

In this study, we isolated a novel WD40 repeat-containing gene, human nuclear receptor interaction protein (NRIP). We found NRIP interacts with either androgen or glucocorticoid receptors from in vitro and in vivo pulldown assays. Subsequently, transient transfection and luciferase activity assays suggested that NRIP was a ligand-dependent coactivator of steroid receptors (androgen and glucocorticoid) in distinct promoters. To further clarify the function of NRIP, we found an RNA interference-3-targeted NRIP gene sequence (5′-GATGATACAGCACGAGAAC-3′) that could efficiently and specifically knock down endogenous and exogenous NRIP gene expression and that significantly diminished cell proliferation in prostate (LNCaP) and cervical (C33A) cells. Therefore, NRIP may play a role in enhancing the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors and may be a critical target for developing therapeutic agents against nuclear receptor-mediated progression of prostate and cervical cancers.

Nuclear receptor family members function as ligand-inducible transcription factors (2Rochette-Egly C. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The binding of growth hormone to nuclear receptor induces receptor dimerization, facilitating the ability of the nuclear receptor to bind to its cognate response element and recruit coregulators to promote the expression of target genes (3Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). In the past decade, several coactivators have been cloned and characterized that associate with steroid receptors and enhance their ability to transactivate target genes (4Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 45-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Well studied coactivators include the p160 family proteins (SRC-1, TIF-2/GRIP-1, ACTR/-CIP) (5Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Bramlett K.S. Clawson D. Burris T.P. Vitam. Horm. 2004; 68: 145-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), resulting in efficient recruitment of coactivators by the nuclear receptor to the target gene and/or the stabilization of general initiation factors that form pre-initiation complexes on common core promoter elements (13Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Some coactivators contain intrinsic histone acetyltransferase or methyltransferase activities, suggesting that they modify chromatin and integrating stimuli into an appropriate transcription response at a wide variety of promoters (14Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1603: 19-29PubMed Google Scholar, 15Klochendler-Yeivin A. Yaniv M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1551: M1-M10PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). In addition, a class of coregulators serves as bridges mediating interactions between the coactivators and other general transcription factors at post-chromatin-remodeling steps (17Roeder R.G. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 201-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In this study, we isolated a novel gene named nuclear receptor interaction protein (NRIP) by using the yeast two-hybrid system. From amino acid sequence comparisons, NRIP is identical to the unnamed protein product (GenBank™ accession number CAD 48617) that was deposited in NCBI on September 2002 with unknown function. Therefore, we characterized this human novel gene (NRIP) by assaying its subcellular location, interaction with nuclear receptors (such as AR and GR), and transactivation activity in distinct promoters. Our results indicate that NRIP contains 860 amino acids and its expression is restricted to the cell nucleus. Additionally, NRIP binds to both AR and GR and functions as a nuclear receptor coactivator. Therefore, NRIP may be a transcriptional cofactor of steroid receptors. To further define the roles of NRIP, short interference RNA (siRNA)-mediated NRIP gene silencing in mammalian cells was conducted. A specific NRIP siRNA targeting sequence was also found that could knock down endogenous and exogenous NRIP gene expression, resulting in significantly diminished cell proliferation in prostate (LNCaP) and cervical (C33A) cancer cells. Therefore, our data illustrate that the novel gene NRIP may function to enhance transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors and thus can be a therapeutic target for eliminating tumor growth. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—A pACT2-HeLa MATCHMAKER cDNA library (Clontech) that consists of the GAL4 activation domain (aa 768–881) fused with a human HeLa cDNA library was transformed into CG-1945 yeast strain (Clontech), along with a plasmid, pAS2–1-AR595–918, containing GAL4 DBD (aa 1–147) fused with the C-terminal domain of AR (aa 595–918). ∼5 × 106 yeast transformants were screened and selected on synthetic dropout (S.D.; Difico) medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine in the presence of 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT; Sigma) and 10 nm dihydrotestosterone (DHT; Sigma). Colonies were tested for LacZ reporter gene activity in a β-galactosidase filter assay. Plasmid DNAs from positive clones were recovered from yeast, amplified in Escherichia coli, and confirmed by sequencing. 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)-PCR—5′-RACE-PCR was used to obtain the remaining 5′-end sequence of the above isolated NRIP gene. The PCR amplification was performed using human HeLa Marathon-ready cDNA (Clontech) as a template. The first amplification was performed using the adaptor primer 1 and the gene-specific primer 5′-GAGGTCATTTCTTTCTCCTGAGTTGGA-3′ for 28 cycles followed by a final elongation of 10 min at 72 °C. Each cycle consisted of 15 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 58 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. 1 μl of PCR product was used as a template for the second amplification with the adaptor primer 2 and the nested gene-specific primer 5′-ACTGGTTCACCTGTCCCTGGTTTGG-3′ for 28 cycles, using the same conditions as those used for the first amplification. Thereafter, the PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced. Plasmid Constructions—The full-length NRIP was cloned in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1-HisC (Invitrogen) and named pcDNA3.1-HisC-NRIP, containing N-terminal Xpress and histidine epitope tags. The plasmid pEGFP-NRIP was generated by tagging EGFP at the 5′-end of the NRIP gene. Mutant NRIP was made by following two PCR-based approaches as described by Mikaelian and Sergeant (18Mikaelian I. Sergeant A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 376Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Wild-type NRIP was used as a template, and the primers sequences are as follows: 5′-TGCGAATTCATGTCTCGGGGTGGCTCCTACCCACAC-3′ (primer 1); 5′-GGTGAATTCTTATTCCTCATCCTCATTTTCATTCTCTTG-3′ (primer 2); 5′-GACCCGAAAGACGACACGGCCCGGGAGCTGAAAACTCCT-3′ (mutagenic primer 3); 5′-AGGAGTTTTCAGCTCCCGGGCCGTGTCGTCTTTCGGGTC-3′ (mutagenic primer 4). Mutagenic primers 3 and 4 contained silent mutations (underlined) corresponding to the RNA interference (RNAi) 3-targeted position (Fig. 7A). Primer 1 and mutagenic primer 4 were used as a pair in one reaction; mutagenic primer 3 and primer 2 were used in a separate reaction in the first round of PCR. Amplified products were loaded on 1% agarose gel and purified. In the second round of PCR, 20–50 ng of each purified fragment were mixed as a template and added to primers 1 and 2 containing EcoRI sites for PCR as described previously (18Mikaelian I. Sergeant A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 376Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The obtained mutant NRIP fragment was inserted into the pEGFP-C2 vector and named pEGFP-NRIP (mt). The plasmid pcDNA3.1-angiostatin-HA was derived from the NotI fragment from pXX-angiostatin-HA (19Lai C.C. Wu W.C. Chen S.L. Xiao X. Tsai T.C. Huan S.J. Chen T.L. Tsai R.J. Tsao Y.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2401-2407PubMed Google Scholar) subcloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector; therefore it contained cDNA of mouse angiostatin (aa 1–466) and a HA tag at its C-terminal. Northern Blotting Analysis—Human multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased from Clontech. A probe corresponding to the full-length cDNA of NRIP was 32P-labeled in vitro using a random prime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol and hybridized overnight. After washing, the blot was exposed and autoradiographed. The relative amount of β-actin in each lane of the blot was used to monitor the amount of total RNA. RT-PCR Analysis—For reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the total RNA (20 μg) from each sample was reverse-transcribed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). 1 μl of cDNA was amplified by PCR using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). The following forward and reverse primers were used: (NRIP-F), 5′-ATGTCTCGGGGTGGCTCCTACCCACAC-3′; (NRIP-R), 5′-ACTGGTTCACCTGTCCCTGGTTTGG-3′; (AR-F), 5′-CAGGAATTCCTGTGCATGAAAGCCATGCTACTC-3′; (AR-R), 5′-TCACTGGGTGTGGAAATAGAT-3′; (GR-F), 5′-CTCACTGGCTGTCGCTTCTCA-3′; (GR-R), 5′-GTCTGATCTCCAAGGACTCTC-3′; (PSA-F), 5′-ATGTGGGTCCCGGTTGTCTTCCTCACC-3′; (PSA-R), 5′-TCAGGGGTTGGCCACGATGGTGTCCTT-3′; (β-actin-F), 5′-ACCTTCAACACCCCAGCCATG-3′; (β-actin-R), 5′-CTGGAAGAGTGCCTCAGGGCA-3′. These primers amplify, respectively, 1427 bp of the N-terminal region of NRIP, 357 bp of the C-terminal region of AR, 511 bp of the N-terminal region of GR, 786 bp of full-length PSA, and 414-bp of the β-actin fragment, which was used to determine the relative amounts of RNA among samples. In Vitro Pulldown Assay—The AR, GR, NRIP, and angiostatin protein expression plasmids used in this study were pcDNA3.0-AR, RSVT7-hGR (a kind gift from Dr. Tsu-Chung Chang, National Defense Medical Center, Taiwan), pcDNA3.1-HisC-NRIP, and pcDNA3.1-angiostatin-HA, respectively. Each 35S-labeled protein was generated by in vitro transcription-translation with the TnT system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The translated full-length AR or GR protein was preincubated at 4 °C for 1 h with ligand in modified radioimmune precipitation assay binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 0.25% gelatin) and mixed with Xpress-tagged NRIP lysates. An antibody to the Xpress epitope (Invitrogen) was added to the mixtures. Afterward, the precipitated complexes were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—The cell lysates from cells transfected with expression plasmids or control vector were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against either Xpress (Invitrogen) or HA (Clontech) or GFP (sc-9996; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or AR (G122–434; BD Biosciences) or GR (PA1–510A; Affinity BioReagents). The bound proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, blotted with specific antibody, and detected using an ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence Microscopy Assay—Human 293T cells on chamber slides (Nunc) were transfected with 10 μg of pEGFP-NRIP using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with a nuclear counterstaining dye, 0.2 μg/ml DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, blue color; Sigma). Fluorescent GFP·NRIP was monitored by a ZEISS Axiovert 100 m inverted confocal laser microscope. Luciferase Reporter Plasmid DNA Constructions—The plasmid LCR-79 contained a 79-bp oligonucleotide covering the sequence from 7352 to 7430 of HPV-16 long control region (LCR) (GenBank™ accession number NC_001526) including the ARE/GRE sequence (5′-GCTACAtccTGTTTT-3′). The synthesized 79-bp oligonucleotides were cloned into a pGL3-Promoter vector (Promega) at KpnI and XhoI sites and named LCR-79 (Fig. 6A). The prostate-specific antigen reporter construct (PSA-Luc) was kindly provided by Dr. Mien-Chie Hung (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas) (20Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B. Bartholomeusz G. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6841-6845PubMed Google Scholar). MMTV-Luc plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. M. Danielsen, Georgetown University, Washington, D.C. Cell Culture and Luciferase Activity Assays—293T and C33A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% minimal essential medium non-essential amino acids solution (Invitrogen). LNCaP cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Prior to transfection, cells were seeded on 60-mm dishes at a density of 4 × 105 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (Hy-Clone) for 24 h. Transient transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or SuperFect (Qiagen) transfection reagents according to the manufacturers' instructions. DNA constructs as indicated were transfected, including 2 μg of internal control (pCH110, β-galactosidase; Amersham Biosciences). The total amount of plasmid transfected per dish was kept constant by adding empty pcDNA3 vector as needed. 24 h after each transfection, the medium was changed and treated with or without 10 nm DHT or dexamethasone. After another 24 h, cells were harvested and the luciferase activity assayed by a Luminoskan TL Plus luminometer (Thermo Labsystems). The β-galactosidase activity of cell lysates was determined and used to normalize luciferase activity. Design and Construction of siRNA—The pSUPER vector-based RNAi system (21Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3975) Google Scholar) was used in this study. Based on empirical guidelines (22Mittal V. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), seven 19-nucleotide stretches within the coding region of NRIP were designed, ∼50% GC-rich and unique in the human genome (Fig. 7A). For example, the RNAi-1-specific targeted sequence of NRIP corresponding to nucleotides 580–598 was designed as follows: 5′-GATCCCCGATGGAACTGTTAGGTGGTttcaagagaACCACCTAACAGTTCCATCTTTTTGGAAA-3′. The gene-specific targeting sequence was subsequently subcloned downstream of the H1-RNA promoter between the BglII and HindIII sites in a pSUPER vector (a kind gift from Dr. Reuven Agami, Netherlands Cancer Institute). RNAi-2, -3, -4, -5, -6, and -7 were constructed in a similar manner. Cell Proliferation Assay—The Cell Titer 96® Aqueous One solution cell proliferation assay is a quantitative colorimetric method for determining mammalian cell survival and proliferation. Cells were seeded at 105 cells/well into 24-well plates and maintained in the absence of hormone-containing medium for 24 h. Cells were then transiently transfected with 2 μg of RNAi-3 plasmid DNA/well using the FuGENE 6 or SuperFect transfection reagent. 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with or without 10 nm DHT for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. 100 μl of Cell Titer 96® Aqueous One solution reagent (Promega) was added to each well, and the absorbance at 490 nm was read after incubation for 4 h at 37 °C by a PerkinElmer Lambda 40 UV/VIS spectrophotometer. GenBank™ Accession Number—The human NRIP nucleotide and protein sequences have been submitted to the GenBank™ data base with accession numbers AY766164 and AAX09330. Isolation and Cloning of NRIP Gene—In this study, we isolated NRIP by using the androgen receptor (amino acids 595–918) as the bait to screen a human HeLa MATCHMAKER cDNA library in a yeast two-hybrid screening assay. Full-length NRIP cDNA (3085 bp) contained 93 bp of 5′-untranslated region, 409 bp of 3′-untranslated region, and 2583 bp of open reading frame (Fig. 1A) that encoded a protein of 860 amino acids (aa) with a calculated mass of 96 kDa (Fig. 1B). The flanking sequence of the start codon (ATG) of NRIP is GCCATGTCTCGG, which is similar to the Kozak sequences ((A/G)cc ATG Gat) (23Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2820) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of NRIP was identical to the unnamed protein product (GenBank™ accession number CAD48617) reported in NCBI in September 2002 of unknown function. Based on SMART data base (smart.emblheidelberg.de/) search results, NRIP was found to contain several important functional domains. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, NRIP contains seven WD40 domains (aa 40–79, 82–124, 130–170, 184–220, 238–281, 706–747, and 750–789) (shaded in Fig. 1B and squared in Fig. 1C), and one nuclear translocation signal (aa 676–692) (underlined in panel B and solid boxed in panel C). WD40 domains are conserved sequence motifs of 40 residues, with a GH dipeptide 11–24 residues from the N terminus and the WD dipeptide at the C terminus, and probably contribute to protein-protein interactions (24Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar, 25Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). To look for the evolutionary functions and developmental importance of NRIP in close species, we compared the deduced amino acid sequences with one putative mouse cDNA coding for an unnamed protein product and deposited it in GenBank™ with the accession number AK004618. As shown in Fig. 1B, amino acid sequence analysis of human and mouse NRIP proteins showed 86.3% homology. The mouse NRIP also possessed seven WD40 domains, and the amino acid sequence showed complete homology to human NRIP. The highly conserved protein sequences and, in particular, strong conservation of WD40 domains indicated NRIP might have developmental and evolutionary significance. To determine the size of the NRIP protein, we transfected a plasmid encoding Xpress-tagged NRIP into 293T cells and performed an in vivo immunoprecipitation assay. Analysis of the cell extracts detected a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 160 kDa (Fig. 1D). This significantly higher mass than predicted (96 kDa) may have been due to aberrant electrophoretic mobility imparted by the highly charged amino acid content (40%) of the protein sequence. To analyze the expression pattern of NRIP mRNA, Northern blot analysis of endogenous NRIP gene expression in human normal tissues was measured by using human multiple tissue Northern blots (Clontech). As shown in Fig. 2A, NRIP mRNA (4 kb) was highly expressed in skeletal muscle and testis and was expressed to a lesser degree in heart, prostate, and adrenal gland. Human NRIP showed some specific features such as a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) motif and seven WD40 domains (Fig. 1B). The NLS sequence suggested that NRIP may be a nuclear protein. As shown in Fig. 3, subcellular compartmentalization of NRIP was restricted to the nucleus as seen by examining expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged NRIP (panel A) under a fluorescence microscope; this was confirmed by DAPI nucleus staining (panel C). NRIP may be involved in protein-protein interactions, because WD40 repeats are thought to coordinate interactions with other proteins and/or small ligands (24Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar, 25Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Based on its nuclear localization and its association with AR in our yeast two-hybrid assay, we inferred that NRIP might play a role in regulating the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptors, such as AR and GR, play an important role in some hormone-responsive tumors (26Wiseman H. Duffy R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 205-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Before investigating whether NRIP was involved in hormone-related regulation, we first analyzed the gene expression of NRIP, AR, and GR in various cell lines (such as 293T, C33A, CaSki, HeLa, SiHa, MCF-7, SCM-1, PC-3, and LNCaP) by RT-PCR using total RNA from each cell line as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expected 1427-bp fragment of NRIP was detectable in all tested cancer cell lines (Fig. 2B). The 357-bp AR PCR fragment was only detected in LNCaP, MCF-7, and HeLa cells. The 511-bp product of GR was significantly detected in PC-3, SCM-1, SiHa, HeLa, and CaSki cells. This indicated that NRIP is ubiquitously expressed in all the tested cancer cells. Protein-Protein Interactions between NRIP and AR or GR—To analyze whether NRIP had the characteristics of a transcriptional coregulator, we first determined the interaction between nuclear receptors (AR or GR) and NRIP using an in vitro pulldown assay. The assay was performed using an in vitro transcription-translation system that expressed high levels of AR or GR and Xpress-tagged NRIP protein. A mouse monoclonal anti-Xpress epitope tag antibody was employed for co-immunoprecipitations; the resulting immune complexes are shown in Fig. 4A. Both AR and GR were found to interact with NRIP in the presence of its cognate ligand (lanes 7 and 8, respectively). In addition, we performed an in vivo assay by co-transfecting AR or GR expression constructs plus a GFP-tagged NRIP plasmid (pEGFP-NRIP) into 293T cells and treated with DHT (Fig. 4A, lane 7) on Dex (Fig. 4A, lane 8) ligand, respectively. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to GFP, AR, or GR, and the precipitates were blotted using the indicated antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 6, AR associated with NRIP. Likewise, Fig. 4C, lanes 4 and 6, showed that GR also interacted with NRIP. In summary, our data demonstrated that NRIP could directly interact with either AR or GR in the presence of its specific ligand under in vitro and in vivo conditions. NRIP Enhances AR- or GR-mediated Transcriptional Activity of MMTV Promoter—Because NRIP could bind with either AR or GR (Fig. 4), we examined whether NRIP could regulate the nuclear receptors on a naturally occurring gene promoter. The MMTV promoter was chosen because the steroid hormone receptors (AR and GR) are known to regulate MMTV-driven gene expression in a ligand-dependent fashion (27Schule R. Rangarajan P. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Yang N. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). 293T and C33A cells were chosen for these assays because these two cell lines weakly express endogenous AR and GR (Fig. 2B). Therefore, 293T and C33A cells were co-transfected with an MMTV-Luc reporter construct (containing two copies of androgen and four copies of glucocorticoid receptor response elements fused upstream of a luciferase reporter gene) as well as a steroid receptor expression plasmid (either AR or GR), plus NRIP with or without ligand. As shown in Fig. 5, the ligand-free AR had only minimal reporter activity of MMTV-Luc in the presence or absence of NRIP in 293T (Fig. 5A) and C33A cells (Fig. 5B). However, addition of 10 nm 5 α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) resulted in 5.2- and 4.5-fold increases in the transcriptional activities of the MMTV-Luc promoter co-transfected with AR and NRIP in 293T (Fig. 5A) and C33A (Fig. 5B) cells, respectively, indicating that NRIP can increase AR-driven transcriptional activity with ligand present. When NRIP was added to cells containing MMTV-Luc and GR in the absence of ligand, negligible GR transcriptional activity was seen in 293T and C33A cells (Fig. 5, C and D). Addition of 10 nm dexamethasone to cells containing GR and MMTV-Luc, but no NRIP, resulted in 5.7- and 3.1-fold increases of GR transcriptional activity in 293T (Fig. 5C) and C33A (Fig. 5D) cells, respectively. An even greater increase in GR transcriptional activity was seen, however, in cells with NRIP present, 18.2- and 21.9-fold, respectively, in 293T (Fig. 5C) and C33A (Fig. 5D) cells. The above data indicated NRIP could enhance AR- or GR-mediated transcription activity in the presence of AR or GR ligands, implying that NRIP functions as a ligand-dependent coactivator of nuclear receptors by enhancing their transcriptional activity. The Effects of NRIP on the Transcriptional Activities of PSA and HPV-16 Promoter—To determine the relevance of NRIP in cancers, we investigated two hormone-related diseases, prostate cancer and cervical cancer. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death of men in the United States (28Dixon S.C. Knopf K.B. Figg W.D. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 73-91PubMed Google Scholar). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a 33-kDa glycoprotein, elevated levels of which occur in sera from prostate cancer patients (29Gittes R.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Hence, PSA is a sensitive indicator of tumor burden. AR is responsible for the transactivation of PSA through its binding to a steroid receptor binding consensus sequence in PSA promoter/enhancer regions. To investigate the role of NRIP in prostate cancers, transient transfections were carried out in AR-expressing prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) (Fig. 2B) with reporter construct PSA-Luc, generated by subcloning a genomic DNA (∼1.5 kb) containing the PSA promoter (640 bp) and enhancer (∼820 bp) linked into the luciferase expression vector, and have throughout been used to analyze AR-mediated transcriptional activity (20Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B. Bartholomeusz G. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6841-6845PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicated that PSA promoter activity was significantly activated by AR plus NRIP in a ligand-dependent manner in LNCaP cells (Fig. 6A). Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) is the most frequently found virus in cervical cancers and the most extensively studied for the effect of hormones on viral gene expression (30Khare S. Pater M.M. Tang S.C. Pater A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Concurrently, steroid hormones are proposed to act as cofactors with HPVs in the etiology of cervical cancer (31Moodley M. Moodley J. Chetty R. Herrington C.S. Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer. 2003; 13"
https://openalex.org/W2152108649,"Reverse gyrase is a unique type IA topoisomerase that can introduce positive supercoils into DNA. We have investigated some of the biochemical properties of Archaeoglobus fulgidus reverse gyrase. It can mediate three distinct supercoiling reactions depending on the adenine nucleotide cofactor that is present in the reaction. Besides the ATP-driven positive supercoiling reaction, the enzyme can introduce negative supercoils with a nonhydrolyzable analog, adenylyl imidodiphosphate. In the presence of ADP the plasmid DNA is relaxed almost completely, leaving a very low level of positive supercoiling. Surprisingly, the final supercoiling extent for all three distinct reactions depends on the stoichiometry of enzyme to DNA. This dependence is not due to the difference of reaction rate, suggesting that the amount of enzyme bound to DNA is an important determinant for the final supercoiling state of the reaction product. Reverse gyrase also displays exquisite sensitivity toward temperature. Raising the reaction temperatures from 80 to 85 °C, both of which are within the optimal growth temperature of A. fulgidus, greatly increases enzyme activity for all the supercoiling reactions. For the reaction with AMPPNP, the product is a hypernegatively supercoiled DNA. This dramatic enhancement of the reverse gyrase activity is also correlated with the appearance of DNA in a pre-melting state at 85 °C, likely due to the presence of extensively unwound regions in the plasmid. The possible mechanistic insights from these findings will be presented here. Reverse gyrase is a unique type IA topoisomerase that can introduce positive supercoils into DNA.

The possible mechanistic insights from these findings will be presented here. The intertwining of DNA strands in a double helical structure creates interesting topological problems when genetic information is accessed and transacted. DNA topoisomerases are versatile and ubiquitous enzymes that are specifically used to resolve such problems (for review, see Refs. 1Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar and 2Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). These enzymes use a tyrosine residue at the active site to reversibly cleave DNA by forming a transient tyrosyl phosphodiester bond. DNA topoisomerases are classified into two types based on biochemical mechanism and structural analysis. Type I enzymes make one single-stranded break at a time; type II enzymes make a concerted double-stranded break and allow another segment of DNA to pass through this transient break. Type I topoisomerases are further grouped into two subfamilies. Type IA enzymes, including bacterial topo 1The abbreviations used are: topo, topoisomerase; AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate; Tm, T. maritima. 1The abbreviations used are: topo, topoisomerase; AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate; Tm, T. maritima. I, topo III, and eukaryotic topo III, covalently link to the 5′ phosphoryl end at the DNA break and allow the complementary strand to pass through this protein-mediated DNA gate (3Dekker N.H. Rybenkov V.V. Duguet M. Crisona N.J. Cozzarelli N.R. Bensimon D. Croquette V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12126-12131Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Type IB enzymes, primarily consisting of eukaryotic nuclear topo I, work by covalently joining the 3′ phosphoryl end at the nick so that the strand with a 5′ hydroxyl end can undergo a controlled rotation around the complementary strand (4Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Such a difference in the biochemical mechanism between these two subfamilies of type I enzymes suggests that they have distinct intracellular functions. Type IB can readily remove both positive and negative supercoils, thereby serving as an efficient swivel, whereas type IA enzymes have more divergent functions besides a role as swivel. Type IA enzymes have a preference for the single-stranded region in the DNA substrate and in most cases can only relax negatively supercoiled, double-stranded DNA.Reverse gyrase was first discovered in the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium, Sulfolobus, and has a unique activity in generating positively supercoiled DNA at the expense of ATP hydrolysis (5Kikuchi A. Asai K. Nature. 1984; 309: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). It is a type I DNA topoisomerase and has two closely linked domains, a helicase-like domain and a type IA topoisomerase (6Krah R. Kozyavkin S.A. Slesarev A.I. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Declais A.C. Marsault J. Confalonieri F. de La Tour C.B. Duguet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19498-19504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Confalonieri F. Elie C. Nadal M. de La Tour C. Forterre P. Duguet M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9Rodriguez A.C. Stock D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The biological functions of reverse gyrase are not completely understood but presumably are intimately linked to its role in generating positive supercoils in DNA. It has been purified from a number of hyperthermophilic eubacteria and archaebacteria, and genome-wide sequence mining revealed that it is the only hyperthermophile-specific protein (10Forterre P. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 236-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, likely that reverse gyrase may have important functions in stabilizing the genome structure at high temperature. Genetic knock-out experiments demonstrated that the reverse gyrase mutant is viable but displays significant growth defects at high temperature (11Atomi H. Matsumi R. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4829-4833Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical experiments suggest that reverse gyrase has an additional function in protecting the DNA strand breakage promoted by exposing DNA to high temperature (12Kampmann M. Stock D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3537-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, reverse gyrase may have multiple functions in protecting the genome from a hostile growth environment.A type II DNA topoisomerase, DNA gyrase, has an ATP-driven activity to introduce negative supercoils (13Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3872-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The vectorial DNA supercoiling process is brought about by the unique right-handed wrapping of DNA around the enzyme and subsequent strand passage through the wrapped DNA segment (for review, see Refs. 2Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar and 14Maxwell A. Gellert M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 69-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanism for the vectorial supercoiling of a type IA enzyme, reverse gyrase, is still unclear. Interestingly, the helicase domain lacks the DNA translocation activity and cannot displace a short DNA strand from its annealed strand (7Declais A.C. Marsault J. Confalonieri F. de La Tour C.B. Duguet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19498-19504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). How the ATP binding and hydrolysis are coordinated and used by reverse gyrase to drive the positive supercoiling remains an exciting area of investigation.We have examined some of the biochemical properties of a recombinant reverse gyrase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. It is the only enzyme with high resolution structures of the apoenzyme and the enzyme complexed with a non-hydrolyzable analog AMPPNP (9Rodriguez A.C. Stock D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It consists of two structurally distinct domains, an N-terminal helicase domain and a C-terminal type IA topoisomerase domain. Biochemical studies of this enzyme have been carried out to investigate the role of the “latch” in the enzyme to regulate the topoisomerase activity and ATP hydrolysis (15Rodriguez A.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5993-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Rodriguez A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29865-29873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this report we present data on the distinct DNA supercoiling activities of the Archaeoglobus reverse gyrase in the presence of different adenosine nucleotide cofactors. Besides the hallmark positive supercoiling reaction with ATP, reverse gyrase can introduce negative supercoils with AMP-PNP. With ADP, reverse gyrase can more or less relax the plasmid DNA but leave behind a low level of positive supercoils in the DNA product. For all these reactions the final extent of DNA supercoiling depends on the enzyme to DNA ratio, suggesting that DNA binding to the enzyme is critical for the supercoiling state of the reaction product. We propose a model that the reverse gyrase has a structure-specific affinity for DNA depending on its association with ATP or ADP, and this distinct affinity of reverse gyrase for single versus double-stranded DNA controls the direction of DNA supercoiling in these reactions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA and Enzymes—Plasmid DNA pGFP-C1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) is 4.73 kilobases in length. It was purified through double banding in CsCl/ethidium bromide density gradient ultracentrifugation. After the removal of ethidium by butanol extraction, the DNA sample was dialyzed exhaustively into TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA) and used as a substrate for reverse gyrase reactions. Singly nicked DNA was prepared by digesting DNA with pancreatic DNase I in the presence of saturating amounts of ethidium bromide as described previously (17Hsieh T.-S. Wang J.C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Relaxed DNA was prepared by treating the plasmid DNA with recombinant Drosophila topoisomerase I (18Hsieh T.-S. Brown S.D. Huang P. Fostel J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6177-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both nicked and relaxed DNA were purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation after the enzymatic reaction. Reverse gyrase was purified from a bacterial strain expressing cloned A. fulgidus reverse gyrase (9Rodriguez A.C. Stock D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) following the published procedure with minor modifications. The purified protein was further chromatographed through a Porus HQ column (PerSeptive Biosystems, Farmington, MA). The pooled fractions were dialyzed into a buffer containing 15 mm KPi, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol and stored at –20 °C. This recombinant Archaeoglobus reverse gyrase contained two mutations introduced during molecular cloning: Pro-719 to Leu and Leu-1046 to Met (16Rodriguez A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29865-29873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The crystal structure and most of the published biochemical experiments were from this recombinant enzyme. Although these mutations allow for efficient expression in Escherichia coli cells, they do not appear to alter the biochemical properties of DNA supercoiling when compared with the wild type protein (15Rodriguez A.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5993-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Rodriguez A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29865-29873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To isolate a thermostable topoisomerase I, we cloned the top1 gene from Thermotoga maritima by obtaining top1 gene through PCR similar to the method described by Viard et al. (19Viard T. Lamour V. Duguet M. Bouthier de la Tour C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46495-46503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thermotoga top1 was cloned into pET23b vector (Novogen, CT) such that a hexahistidine tag was fused in frame to the C terminus. The cloned vector was sequenced and transformed into the T7-expression strain BL21(DE3)LysS. T. maritima topoisomerase I (Tm topo I) was induced and purified through a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column. Taq DNA ligase was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA).Reverse Gyrase Reaction—A typical reaction mixture for reverse gyrase contains 0.45 μg of DNA and reverse gyrase in a 30 μl solution of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml gelatin, and 1 mm adenine nucleotide cofactor when required. A drop of mineral oil was added to cover the surface of the solution, and the reaction was initiated by immersing the reaction tube in a water bath set at either 80 or 85 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding EDTA and SDS to a final concentration of 10 mm and 0.1%, respectively. If the reaction mixture was to be analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, sucrose and tracking dyes (bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol) were added to a concentration of 5 and 0.01%, respectively. Because of the difficulty in manipulating the reaction mixture at high temperature, the time-course reaction was carried out in aliquots of separate reaction tubes. A grand reaction mixture complete with all ingredients was constituted and separated into aliquots in separate reaction tubes. After adding the mineral oil, they were immersed in a water bath. At intervals of 3.5, 7, 15, 30, 60, or 120 min they were removed, and reactions were stopped.DNA Ligase Reactions—DNA ligation of singly nicked DNA was carried out under conditions identical to those for reverse gyrase reactions except for the cofactors. The reaction mixture contained 0.5 μg of DNA and 7.5 units of Taq DNA ligase in 30-μl solutions of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml gelatin, and 1 mm NAD. The reaction solution was layered with a drop of mineral oil, and the reaction was carried out by immersing in a water bath with temperature ranging from 50 to 85 °C for 15 min. Analysis of DNA products from reactions with 7.5 or 30 min gave the same amount and pattern of DNA topoisomer distribution as that from the 15 min reaction, indicating that the reaction was complete under our reaction conditions.Tm Topo I Relaxation Reaction—DNA relaxation reactions were carried out under conditions similar to those for reverse gyrase except for no cofactors were added. One unit of enzyme was defined as the activity capable of relaxing 0.4 μg of plasmid DNA in 30 min at 75 °C.Agarose Gel Electrophoresis—DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose under a voltage gradient of 1.5 V/cm for 16 h in room temperature. The sign of supercoiling for DNA products was determined by the following methods. Gel electrophoresis could be carried out at 4 °C. If DNA topoisomers gained mobility upon lowering the running temperature from ambient room temperature to 4 °C, they were negatively supercoiled, and a reduced mobility would indicate they were positively supercoiled. DNA topoisomers not resolved under either of these conditions were analyzed by electrophoresis in the presence of varying chloroquine concentrations ranging from 30 to 120 μm. Hypernegatively supercoiled DNA, which failed to be completely resolved by electrophoresis in 120 μm chloroquine, were analyzed by running the gel in the presence of 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide. We were able to resolve all the DNA products into topoisomer bands under one of the aforementioned conditions. At the end of electrophoresis the gel was first stained in a solution of 0.3 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 30 min, then irradiated with intense UV light to promote nicking of DNA. The gel was stained again for an additional 30 min, after which it was destained for 1 h. For the gels with high concentrations of chloroquine, the destaining process could take up to 3 h. The stained/destained gel was imaged with EpiChem system (UVP Bioimaging System, Garland, CA). The digitized images could be further processed for analysis by LabWorks Imaging and Analysis Software (UVP Bioimaging System).RESULTSNucleotide-dependent DNA Supercoiling—Earlier works have shown that positive DNA supercoiling by reverse gyrase requires a nucleoside triphosphate cofactor with a preference or specificity for ATP and dATP (16Rodriguez A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29865-29873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20Shibata T. Nakasu S. Yasui K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10419-10421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether nucleotide cofactors other than ATP have any effect on the reactions by reverse gyrase, we examined the reactions carried out with different forms of adenosine nucleotide using a plasmid DNA as the substrate (Fig. 1). In the absence of exogenous cofactor or in the presence of AMP there is a slow relaxation of the plasmid DNA (Fig. 1, lanes 5–10 and 11–15), evidenced by the appearance of topoisomers at the longest time point. As expected, the presence of ATP promotes the positive supercoiling reaction (Fig. 1, lanes 21–25). Interestingly, ADP enhances the relaxation reaction, which is complete within 3.5 min when the first time point was taken (lanes 16–20). The DNA supercoiling reaction in the presence of ATP is also preceded by a rapid relaxation, giving rise to the appearance of a biphasic reaction; that is, a fast relaxation of the plasmid negative supercoils followed by a slower insertion of positive supercoils. Using gel electrophoresis in the presence of various chloroquine concentrations, we determined that the plasmid substrate used here, a DNA with 4.7 kilobases in length, contains about 30 supercoils (superhelical density σ = –0.06). Therefore, there is a rapid relaxation within 3.5 min to remove 30 negative supercoils followed by a slow insertion of 5 positive supercoils in the reaction with ATP. Further analysis of the relaxation reaction rates in the presence of ADP, ATP, or AMP-PNP demonstrates that the relaxation rate is faster than the supercoiling by at least 2 orders of magnitude (data not shown).In the presence of a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, AMP-PNP, one also observes a partial relaxation of DNA at the first time point followed by a slower DNA supercoiling reaction (lanes 26–30). To address whether the supercoiling is positive or negative, we analyzed the reaction products with gel electrophoresis in the presence and absence of 30 μm chloroquine (lower and upper panels of Fig. 2, respectively). As a reference we loaded in the same gels the products from the reactions with no cofactor, AMP, and ATP. In the presence of a DNA unwinding agent, chloroquine, plasmid DNA is slightly negatively supercoiled and resolved as distinct topoisomer species (leftmost lane, SC, Fig. 2). DNA from reactions with no cofactor or with AMP is partially relaxed, running as slightly negatively supercoiled in the early time points then as slightly positively supercoiled in later time points. In contrast, the relaxed DNA from reactions with ATP in early time points and the positively supercoiled product in the later time points ran as highly positively supercoiled species. The products of the AMPPNP reaction have similar mobilities to the DNA from no cofactor or AMP reactions, suggesting that they are negatively supercoiled. It is interesting to note that depending on the presence of cofactors, reverse gyrase can carry out all three distinct topoisomerization reactions, namely relaxation, positive, and negative DNA supercoiling.Fig. 2Analysis of DNA products of reverse gyrase reactions by agarose gel electrophoresis in the absence (upper panel) and presence of 30 μm chloroquine (lower panel). The products from a reaction time course identical to those shown in Fig. 1 were analyzed to determine the sign of the supercoiling state of the DNA. In 30 μm chloroquine (CLQ), the plasmid DNA (SC) was run as a group of partially relaxed topoisomer species (left end of the gel), whereas the partially positively supercoiled DNA from the ATP-reverse gyrase reaction migrated as highly positively supercoiled species with a fast electrophoretic mobility. Notice that the topoisomer species can be observed in the gel with chloroquine for the products from reactions with AMP or AMPPNP, suggesting that they are negatively supercoiled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Final Extent of Supercoiling Depends on Enzyme/DNA Stoichiometry—The enzyme/DNA molar ratio for the reactions shown in Fig. 1 was 12, and only limited positive supercoiling was observed in the presence of ATP. To check if a higher amount of enzyme added to the reaction can bring about more positive supercoiling, we carried out the reactions with enzyme/DNA ratios ranging from 47 to 0.84 (Fig. 3). DNA positive supercoiling increases with the enzyme/DNA ratio in the reactions with ATP (lanes 1–5, Fig. 3). The negative supercoiling of reverse gyrase in the presence of AMPPNP also depends on the stoichiometry of the enzyme (lanes 6–10, Fig. 3). These results are unexpected since all the other topoisomerases studied thus far, including DNA gyrase, act catalytically, and the final state of DNA supercoiling is, thus, not sensitive to enzyme stoichiometry. To examine whether dependence of supercoiling on the enzyme/DNA ratio is simply due to a difference in the rate of supercoiling in the presence of varying amounts of reverse gyrase, we carried out the following two experiments. First, time course experiments showed that at both high and low enzyme/DNA ratios, the reactions approached a final supercoiling state after incubation for 1 h (Fig. 4). This is true for reactions with ATP and AMPPNP (Fig. 4, lanes 1–10 and 11–20, respectively). Because the results showed in Fig. 3 were obtained with reactions carried out after a 1-h incubation, the difference in supercoiling state is likely not due to reaction rate. Second, we carried out the reactions under conditions of either constant DNA concentration or constant enzyme concentration and obtained similar results (Fig. 5). In the experiments presented in Figs. 3 and 4, DNA concentration was maintained the same but with varying enzyme concentrations. This type of experiment was repeated again as shown in Fig. 5 (lanes 5–8). In these experiments, DNA concentration was held constant, but enzyme concentrations ranging from 0.08 to 0.7 μm were used to give an enzyme/DNA ratio from 11 to 94. As expected, the final positive supercoiling depends on the stoichiometry. Interestingly, if reactions were carried out at an enzyme concentration of 0.7 μm and varying DNA concentration to give the same range of enzyme/DNA ratio (lanes 1–4, Fig. 5), the final supercoiling states are identical to those obtained using variable enzyme concentrations. Experiments similar to that shown in Fig. 5 were done using AMPPNP as a cofactor, and they demonstrated that the final negative supercoiling state also depends on the enzyme/DNA ratio (data not shown).Fig. 3Stoichiometry-dependent DNA supercoiling by reverse gyrase (RevGyr). Reverse gyrase can carry out positive supercoiling in the presence of ATP (lanes 1–5) and negative supercoiling with AMP-PNP (lanes 6–10). The enzyme/DNA ratios in these reactions were 47, 23, 7.6, 2.5, and 0.84 (lanes 1–5 and lanes 6–10). The extent of supercoiling increases as the stoichiometry increases. The starting material was loaded at the left end of the gel (SC).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Stoichiometry dependence of DNA supercoiling is not due to different reaction rates. Reactions were sampled at intervals of 3.5, 7, 15, 30, and 60 min for reverse gyrase with ATP (lanes 1–10) or with AMPPNP (lanes 11–20). The enzyme/DNA ratio was either 47 (lanes 1–5 and lanes 11–15) or 0.84 (lanes 6–10 and lanes 16–20). At either enzyme/DNA ratio the reaction reached its end point by 60 min. The starting material plasmid DNA (SC) and a marker nicked DNA (NC) were loaded at the left end of gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Stoichiometry dependence of DNA supercoiling is independent of enzyme concentrations. ATP-driven positive supercoiling reactions were carried out with different enzyme/DNA ratios of 94, 46, 23, and 11 at either a constant enzyme concentration of 0.7 μm (lanes 1–4) or constant DNA concentration but different enzyme concentrations of 0.7, 0.35, 0.17, and 0.08 μm (lanes 5–8). Triangles on top of the gel denote the change of enzyme to DNA ratio. Notice that even at an enzyme concentration of 0.7 μm, the extent of supercoiling was identical to a reaction with the same enzyme/DNA ratio but with a nearly 10-fold lower enzyme concentration of 0.08 μm (lane 4 and 8). The starting material plasmid DNA (SC) is in the rightmost lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the experiments shown in Fig. 1 the final products of reverse gyrase reactions in the presence of ADP are relaxed DNA. We have tested if the final supercoiling state of DNA products from such reactions also depends on enzyme/DNA stoichiometry (Fig. 6). In a series of reactions similar to those carried out in Fig. 3 using ADP as a cofactor, the final supercoiling state changes as the enzyme/DNA ratio varies from 47 to 1.2 (lanes 1–5, Fig. 6A). However, the range of supercoiling change is much smaller than that obtained with ATP or AMP-PNP. To ascertain whether the supercoiling change upon increasing reverse gyrase concentrations is positive or negative, we analyzed the same set of reaction products by gel electrophoresis in the presence of a low concentration of the intercalator agent, chloroquine (Fig. 6, panel B). We used the DNA sample from reverse gyrase positive supercoiling reaction with ATP (enzyme/DNA ratio of 7.6) as a control (lane 6 of Fig. 6, A and B). There is a shift of about +4 superhelical turns in the topoisomer species analyzed in the presence of chloroquine. This small shift in DNA supercoiling was not sufficient to bring the plasmid DNA into the range of resolved topoisomers as those shown in Fig. 2, but it could resolve the topoisomers from all the samples of ADP/reverse gyrase reactions (lanes 1–5, Fig. 6B). The higher the amount of enzyme, the more positively supercoiled the product is, and thus, the faster the mobilities of the topoisomers in the chloroquine gel (Fig. 6B). Therefore, in the presence of ADP, reverse gyrase can relax negative supercoils in the plasmid DNA and results in positive supercoiling. The level of positive supercoiling is very low but still depends on the enzyme stoichiometry.Fig. 6Stoichiometric dependence of low level positive supercoiling by reverse gyrase with ADP. Reaction products of reverse gyrase with ADP were loaded in the gel without or with 2 μm chloroquine (panels A and B, respectively). The enzyme/DNA ratios for the reactions were 47, 23, 7.6, 2.5, and 1.2 (lanes 1–5). Positively supercoiled DNA from the ATP/reverse gyrase reaction was loaded (lane 6) to calibrate the supercoiling shift under these two conditions of gel electrophoresis. Notice that the limited shift in supercoiling due to a low concentration of chloroquine is insufficient to resolve the plasmid DNA (SC) in the range of relaxed topoisomers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reverse Gyrase Reactions at 85 °C—The supercoiling reactions for Archaeoglobus reverse gyrase described thus far and in earlier published works (15Rodriguez A.C.

However, dissociation into subunits seems to occur reversibly only in the absence of carotenoids and the subunits were never found to bind carotenoids. The interactions of carotenoids with B820 have been studied in a newly developed reconstitution assay of the LH1 antenna from Rhodospirillum rubrum (Fiedor, L., Akahane, J., and Koyama, Y.

These model studies show that B820 subunits strongly interact with carotenoids and spontaneously form stable LH1-like complexes with substoichiometric carotenoid content. This is the first experimental evidence that B820 may occur as a short-lived intermediate in the assembly of LH1 in vivo. The resulting complex of B820 subunits with carotenoid, termed iB873, is homogeneous, according to ion exchange chromatography and reproducible pigment composition. The iB873-bound carotenoid is as efficient in energy transfer to bacteriochlorophyll as the one in native antenna.

To understand the assembly of the pigment-protein complexes, a detailed knowledge is necessary about the role of each particular component in the assembly, and of their interactions in the oligomeric state. The oligomeric character and modularity of antenna structures became already apparent before the high resolution structural data were obtained, mainly because of the isolation of a B820 subunit form of LH1 (2Loach P.A. Parkes-Loach P.S. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1995: 437-471Google Scholar, 18Miller J.F. Hinchigeri S.B.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1004-1014Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Virtually all LH1 complexes were found to undergo dissociation into such subunits, suggesting their function as a universal structural motif (2Loach P.A. Parkes-Loach P.S. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1995: 437-471Google Scholar). They are thought to consist of a dimeric form of BChl, non-covalently attached to two short hydrophobic polypeptides α and β, organized into a basic unit αβ·(BChla)2 or its dimer (20Chang M.C.

B820, however, has mostly been obtained from Crt-less LH1, and only here is the process fully reversible: depending on the detergent concentration, B820 can be reversibly oligomerized in vitro to Crt-less LH1 (low detergent concentration) or dissociated into smaller subunits that still contain monomeric BChl (high detergent concentration) (18Miller J.F.

If B820 is prepared by dissociation of Crt-containing LH1, the Crts are lost in the process. In this case, dissociation into B820 subunits can hardly be regarded as reversible, because re-association leads to a Crt-less LH1 complex (B870). Also, despite the putative universal character of the B820 subunit, it has never been observed in vivo as an intermediate of the assembly of native, Crt-containing core antennae (24Drews G. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Pugh R.J. McGlynn P. Jones M.R. Hunter C.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 301-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); the intermediacy of B820 in the formation of wild-type, Crt-containing complexes is therefore questionable. There is to date also no evidence that B820 subunits bind Crts (2Loach P.A. Parkes-Loach P.S. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1995: 437-471Google Scholar, 26Moskalenko A. Toropygina O. Kuznetsova N. Z. Naturforsch. 1996; 51: 309-318Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and no Crt-to-B820 energy transfer has been observed in in vitro studies (27Fiedor L. Akahane J. Koyama Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16487-16496Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This indicates that Crts either somehow destabilize the B820 subcomplex, or they strongly promote its aggregation to the extent that Crt-B820 associates are present in too low a concentration to be observed. We have studied the effects of carotenoids on B820 subunits via LH1 reconstitution in a newly developed model system (27Fiedor L. Akahane J. Koyama Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16487-16496Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and provide evidence for the latter case, i.e. that Crts strongly interact with the subunits and enhance their aggregation. We also report on the trapping, for the first time, of a stable LH1-like complex of substoichiometric Crt content, which is a potential intermediate of LH1 assembly. Reagents and Solvents—Acetone, benzene, methanol, and tetrahydrofuran, all of analytical grade, were purchased from Merck and used as supplied. LDAO (30% aqueous solution) was obtained from Fluka and β-n-octylglucopyranoside (β-OG) was from Calbiochem. Carotenoids—Lycopene (Lyc) was extracted from tomato concentrate and purified by column chromatography on alumina, followed by repeated crystallization from a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and n-hexane (28Zhang J.-P. Chen C.-H. Koyama Y. Nagae H. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 1632-1640Crossref Google Scholar). Rhodopin (Rhd) and anhydrorhodovibrin (Anv) were extracted from the cells of Allochromatium vinosum (D). Both pigments were purified by column chromatography on alumina and then recrystallized; Rhd from n-hexane, and Anv from a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and n-hexane (29Fujii R. Ishikawa T. Koyama Y. Taguchi M. Isobe Y. Nagae H. Watanabe Y. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2001; 105: 5348-5355Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Spirilloxanthin (Spx) was extracted from wet cells of Rhodospirillum rubrum strain S1, and purified by low pressure column chromatography on Ca(OH)2, using an acetone/benzene mixture for elution, and purified by recrystallization in n-hexane (30Zhang J.-P. Nagae H. Qian P. Limantara L. Fujii R. Watanabe Y. Koyama Y. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2001; 105: 7312-7322Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). B820 Isolation—Carotenoids were removed from freeze-dried chromatophores by extraction with benzene, as previously described (27Fiedor L. Akahane J. Koyama Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16487-16496Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A 50-mg portion of the resulting powder of benzene-extracted chromatophores was suspended, using a small homogenizer (Potter type), in 2.5 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm, pH 7.8), containing NaCl (10 mm) and sodium ascorbate (1 mm). The suspension was solubilized by a stepwise addition of 200-μl portions of 20% aqueous β-OG (v/w). This treatment was followed by absorption spectroscopy in the 700–900-nm region, and continued until no further changes were observed near 870 nm (final β-OG concentration ∼3.4%). The solubilized fraction of the chromatophores was collected as a dark blue supernatant by centrifugation (6000 × g, 45 min, 4 °C) and was loaded onto a small column (4 cm × 0.5 cm) of DEAE-Sepharose (Fast Flow, Amersham Biosciences), pre-equilibrated in 1% β-OG (10 mm NaCl/20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8). The column was washed with 2–3 ml of the same eluent, and then a NaCl gradient (10–100 mm) was applied. The fraction eluting with 45 mm NaCl (4–5 ml) was discarded, and pure B820 was eluted with 75–85 mm NaCl (∼7 ml) as a dark blue band, with a yield of 70–80% with respect to the initial amount of detergent-solubilized chromatophores. Under these conditions, the RC remained bound to the column. The fraction of purified B820 was kept at –30 °C in the dark. The polypeptide composition of the isolated B820 subunits was analyzed by Tricine SDS-PAGE (31Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10481) Google Scholar). Isolation of Native LH1 Antenna—LH1 was obtained from chromatophores of R. rubrum S1 by a modification of the method of Picorel et al. (32Picorel R. Belanger G. Gingras G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2491-2497Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar), as described elsewhere (27Fiedor L. Akahane J. Koyama Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16487-16496Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Formation of B880 —A sample of purified B820 in 1% β-OG (1 ml, A820 = 9.4, equivalent to 0.11 μmol of BChla) was incubated, while being stirred at room temperature, with increasing amounts of Rhd or Anv. It was added in 0.018-μmol portions as concentrated (0.033 mm) solution in acetone, to a final amount of 0.066 μmol of Crt and a final acetone concentration of ∼20% (v/v). The absorption spectrum of the mixture was measured 5 min after each addition. Formation of Substoichiometric Complexes—To a stirred sample of the purified B820 in 1% β-OG (1 ml, A820 = 9.4) at room temperature a highly concentrated solution (0.2–0.4 mm) of Crt in organic solvent was added in small portions. Usually, 0.025–0.05 μmol of Crt were added per 0.11 μmol of BChla, in several 20–25-μl portions as an acetone solution (total 100 μl), or 5-μl portions of benzene solution (total 20 μl). After removing the excess solvent in a stream of nitrogen (clear solution), the absorption spectrum of the reconstitution mixture was recorded. The sample was then diluted 3-fold with Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm, pH 7.8) and placed in the dark at 4 °C. Usually, after 48–72 h, a dark red precipitate formed, which was collected by a low speed centrifugation (10,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). The precipitate formed with Spx was gently dissolved in a small volume of the Tris buffer, containing 0.8% β-OG and loaded onto a small column (3.5 × 0.5 cm) of DEAE-Sepharose (Fast Flow), pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. The dark red band remaining bound to the column was eluted by a NaCl gradient (50–110 mm) in the presence of 0.8% β-OG. A blue band containing B820 eluted at 70–80 mm NaCl, and a single band of a dark red fraction eluted at 110 mm NaCl. The dark red fraction (termed iB873) was re-chromatographed using the same method, then diluted to 0.7% β-OG, and stored at –30 °C in the dark. Conversion of iB873 into B880 —The isolated fraction of iB873 in 0.7% β-OG (1 ml, A873 = 4.3) was treated while being stirred with portions of Rhd (0.0042, 0.084, 0.0126, and 0.0168 μmol) in acetone, at room temperature. 10 min after adding each portion the absorption spectrum of the solution was measured. Analysis of Pigment Composition—Pigments were extracted from the complexes with an acetone/methanol mixture (7:2, v/v) and tetrahydrofuran, and quantified spectrophotometrically (relative amounts of Crt and BChla) as described previously (27Fiedor L. Akahane J. Koyama Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16487-16496Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Absorption, Fluorescence, and CD Spectroscopy—Electronic absorption spectra were recorded with a Cary 50 spectrophotometer (Varian) in 1-mm quartz cells, and steady-state emission and excitation spectra (corrected) on a Spex Fluorog 1680 spectrofluorimeter (Jobin-Yvon), equipped with 0.22 m double monochromators, using rectangular quartz cells (2 × 10 mm). The absorption and fluorescence measurements were done at room temperature. The circular dichroism (CD) measurements were done with a J-710 (JASCO) spectropolarimeter in 5-mm quartz cells at 15 °C. B820 Isolation—B820 subunits of the LH1 antenna from wild-type R. rubrum were isolated by a controlled solubilization of benzene-extracted chromatophores in detergent. The carotenoid-depleted chromatophores were titrated with β-OG and monitored by NIR absorption spectroscopy. A complete dissociation of the B870 form was achieved at ∼3.4% β-OG. After removing the insoluble residue by centrifugation, the resulting solubilized fraction of B820 subunits (Fig. 1) was separated from the RC and free pigment (BChl) by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose in the presence of 1% β-OG. The same method was found applicable to purify the B820 subunits from chromatophores from a Crt-less G9 strain of R. rubrum (not shown). The absorption spectrum of the B820 fraction is shown in Fig. 1. The high value of the A820/A270 ratio (2.33), exceeding that of other preparations (33Wang Z.-Y. Muraoka Y. Shimonaga M. Kobayashi M.

Soc. 2002; 124: 1072-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the absence of shoulders near 690 nm (chlorin oxidation product) and 770 nm (free BChla) are indicative of the purity of the preparation. The quality of the B820 fraction was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, which showed only two low molecular mass polypeptides at apparent molecular weights between 6 and 10 kDa (not shown). The integrity of the isolated B820 subunits was further confirmed by their ability to reassociate to B870. Lowering the detergent concentration to 0.5%, at room temperature, caused an immediate association of B820 to a species with the QY transition located at 870 nm (Fig. 1). Interactions of Carotenoids with B820 Subunits—Crts were introduced into the B820 system by adding aliquots of concentrated solutions in organic solvents, while keeping all other parameters constant, including in particular the β-OG concentration (1%). As described in previous LH1 reconstitution studies (27Fiedor L. Akahane J. Koyama Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16487-16496Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Davis C.M. Bustamante P.L. Loach P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5793-5804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), acetone (miscible with water) was found appropriate as a carrier for most Crts, allowing the performance of a saturating titration experiment. The absorption spectra recorded during the titration of B820 subunits with Crt are shown in Fig. 2. The addition of Crt (in acetone) to the B820 subunits in 1% β-OG resulted in a gradual red shift of the BChla QY transition to 880–881 nm, and the appearance of Crt absorption bands in the 420–580 nm region. The Crt absorption bands are also red-shifted with respect to the control acetone solutions (Fig. 2 and Table I) or in 1% β-OG without LH1 proteins (not shown). Under titration with Rhd, the changes saturated at a concentration of 5.5 μm, at which point the BChl:Crt ratio is 2:1.2. Acetone alone (not shown) and additional portions of Crt (and acetone) had practically no further effect on the QY transition. Very similar spectral shifts and effects on the B820 subunits were observed with Anv (not shown).Table IMain absorption maxima of different carotenoids and intermediate complexes (iB873)Crt in acetoneIntermediate complex iB873Reconstituted LH1aData taken from Ref. 27.Crt absorptionQyCrt absorptionQyLyc504473446510483454871519486457880Anh516485526493871536503883Spx526493467542505473870549513484883Spx (isolated iB873)543506475873a Data taken from Ref. 27Fiedor L.

Open table in a new tab Formation of an Intermediate of LH1 Complex—The spectra obtained during titration do not show isosbestic points (Fig. 2), which indicates the formation of intermediates. Spectral deconvolution indicated a species with a QY-band of BChl absorbing at 870–872 nm and red-shifted Crt absorption bands, but these intermediates were generally present only as mixtures with B820 and the final B880 complex (not shown). A chance observation, however, was intriguing; complexes with these spectral characteristics precipitate from the solution after the detergent concentration is lowered to 0.33% and chilled to 4 °C. The precipitates were collected by low speed centrifugation, suspended again in the Tris buffer without detergent, and their absorption spectra were measured. Table I lists their main absorption maxima, compared with the absorption maxima of Crts in control acetone solutions and their maxima in LH1 complexes reconstituted with the same Crts (27Fiedor L. Akahane J. Koyama Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16487-16496Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Most of these complexes rapidly deteriorated when solubilized with β-OG (0.8%). However, in the case of Spx, the solubilized precipitate was stable enough to be purified by repeated ion exchange chromatography in the presence of 0.8% β-OG. It was termed iB873 because of: (i) its intermediate BChl (QY at 873 nm) and Crt absorption maxima, between those of B820 and B880 (Fig. 3 and Table I), (ii) its intermediate Crt content, and (iii) the possibility to further convert it to B880 (see below). Properties of iB873—The absorption spectrum of iB873 resembles that of native LH1 (Fig. 3), but with the following differences: (i) the BChl QY transition is slightly broader, and its maximum is blue-shifted to 873 nm; (ii) there is a prominent absorption decrease in the Crt region, which clearly indicates a reduced Crt-to-BChl ratio in this species (see below); (iii) Spx absorption transitions are blue-shifted by 5–11 nm with respect to the corresponding absorption transitions in the native LH1 (see also Table I). The CD spectra of the two complexes, recorded in the range between 350 and 600 nm, show more distinct differences (Fig. 3, inset). Native LH1 shows a broad negative band in the carotenoid region (400–580 nm), located between two positive bands, which are due to the BChla Soret and Qx transitions. This CD spectrum resembles the reported spectrum of photosynthetic membranes from the same bacterium (34Davis C.M. Bustamante P.L. Loach P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5793-5804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 35Cogdell R.J. Scheer H. Photochem. Photobiol. 1985; 42: 669-678Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). iB873 shows instead a broad and well structured positive band in the carotenoid region, whose peaks coincide with the absorption bands. There is also a sign inversion of the Soret-band CD, while the Qx region remained unchanged. Energy Transfer—The emission spectra of native LH1 and iB873 (Fig. 4) were obtained by exciting the complexes at wavelengths corresponding to the maxima of the Crt 0→1 transition, i.e. at 513 nm and 506 nm, respectively, where absorption by BChla in LH1 is minimal (Fig. 1). The emission spectra have very similar shapes; but the emission maximum of iB873 is blue-shifted (5–6 nm) as compared with LH1, which reflects its blue-shifted QY absorption band. In both complexes the Crt is functionally coupled to BChl: the excitation maxima in the Crt region reproduce well the characteristic positions of the Spx absorption maxima in the two complexes, but their relative intensities reflect the reduced Crt content of iB873 (see below). Conversion into B880 —The effects of adding a concentrated solution of Rhd in acetone to purified iB873 (obtained with Spx) are shown in Fig. 5. With more Rhd present, the absorption in the Crt region increases, and at the same time the QY transition narrows and shifts to 882 nm. These changes indicate that iB873 retains the ability to bind more Crt. Pigment Stoichiometry in iB873—The Crt:BChl ratios of LH1 and iB873 were analyzed by an exhaustive pigment extraction into organic solvents. The absorption spectra of the combined extracts, normalized to the intensity of the BChla QY transition, are shown in Fig. 6. As judged from the absence of a chlorin peak near 690 nm, the extraction method is quick and mild enough not to cause oxidation BChla to chlorins (36Smith J.R.L. Calvin M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1966; 88: 4500-4506Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A comparison of the relative intensities of the Crt (at 496 nm) and BChl (at 770 nm) absorption bands shows that the Crt content in iB873 is only 40% of that in the native antenna. Assuming a molar ratio BChla to Crt of 2:1 in the latter (32Picorel R. Belanger G. Gingras G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2491-2497Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar), this ratio is as high as 5:1 in the iB873 associate. Interactions of B820 Subunits with Crts—B820 is, at least in vitro, an intermediate in the assembly of carotenoid-less LH1 (B870) from its components, viz. BChl and the α and β polypeptides. Irrespective of its preparation, it seems always devoid of carotenoids, even if derived from carotenoid-containing bacteria (2Loach P.A. Parkes-Loach P.S. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1995: 437-471Google Scholar, 26Moskalenko A. Toropygina O. Kuznetsova N. Z. Naturforsch. 1996; 51: 309-318Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Its aggregation states and reassociation to B870 have been studied in considerable detail. Depending on the detergent:protein ratio, dimers (22Vegh A.P. Robert B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 23Arluison V. Seguin J. Robert B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11812-11819Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and higher aggregates (37Pandit A. van Stokkum I.H.M. Georgakopoulu S. van der Zwan G. van Grondelle R. Photosynth. Res. 2003; 75: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) have been observed as intermediates during the B870 formation, which showed relatively small red shifts of the QY transitions (845–850 nm). However, no such intermediates have been observed in the few LH1 reconstitution studies, carried out in the presence of Crts (3Fiedor L. Leupold D. Teuchner K. Voigt B. Hunter C.N. Scherz A. Scheer H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3737-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27Fiedor L. Akahane J. Koyama Y.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5793-5804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Complexes of systematically decreasing sizes, which may be considered as intermediates, have been observed in controlled dissociation of LH1 from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (38Westerhuis W.H.J. Niederman R.A. Photosynth. Res. 1992; 34: 112Google Scholar). The formation of a Crt-containing B880 complex by solely adding Crt to B820, without changing the detergent concentration, provides clear evidence for interactions between B820 and Crts. The gradual red shift of the main absorption band in the product and the absence of isosbestic points indicated that this transformation is a multistep process. All Crts applied in the present study (Spx, Anv, Lyc, and Rhd) caused similar effects, irrespective of their rather varied structures, indicating that these interactions are not restricted to a specific type of Crt. There is always a significant red shift of the BChla QY transition, indicating that Crt-B820 interactions cause a considerable change in the aggregation state of the subunits. There is also a red shift of Crt absorptions, which is another, independent, indicator of the Crt-subunit interactions (27Fiedor L. Akahane J. Koyama Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16487-16496Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Formation of iB873—Native LH1 contains 1 Crt per 2 BChl LH1 (32Picor"

Only cysteine replacement of glycine 80 resulted in the complete loss of [3H]GABA uptake, but oocytes expressing this mutant exhibited the sodium-dependent transient currents thought to reflect a charge-moving conformational change. When sodium was removed and subsequently added back, the transients by G80C did not recover, as opposed to wild type, where recovery was almost complete. Remarkably, the transients by G80C could be restored after exposure of the oocytes to either GABA or a depolarizing pre-pulse. These treatments also resulted in a full recovery of the transients by the wild type. Whereas in wild type lithium leak currents are observed after prior sodium depletion, this was not the case for the glycine 80 mutants unless GABA was added or the oocytes were subjected to a depolarizing pre-pulse. Thus, glycine 80 appears essential for conformational transitions in GAT-1. When this residue is mutated, removal of sodium results in “freezing” the transporter in one conformation from which it can only exit by compensatory changes induced by GABA or depolarization. Our results can be explained by a model invoking two outward-facing states of the empty transporter and a defective transition between these states in the glycine 80 mutants.

Our results can be explained by a model invoking two outward-facing states of the empty transporter and a defective transition between these states in the glycine 80 mutants. During ion-coupled transport, conformational changes have to take place to expose ion and solute binding sites alternately to the two sides of the membrane. An important class of solute transporters is the sodium-coupled neurotransmitter transporters, which play a crucial role in synaptic transmission and are members of two distinct families (for reviews, see Ref. 1Kanner B.I.

Evidence for conformational changes during neurotransmitter transport has been obtained using ion- and substrate-dependent changes in accessibility of trypsin-sensitive sites (3Mabjeesh N.J.

Kavanaugh M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3951-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Glycines can introduce flexibility in the protein structure, and recently a glycine residue has been implicated to act as a gating-hinge in potassium channels (9Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). Moreover evidence has been presented suggesting that glycine residues engineered into the proton-coupled lactose transporter confer conformational flexibility to it (10Weinglass A.B. Smirnova I.N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our aim was to evaluate the idea that one or more of the native glycine residues in neurotransmitter transporters may play a role in conformational transitions during transport. Therefore, we have examined the role of a stretch of six conserved residues of the GABA 1The abbreviations used are: used: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; MTSET, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate; ND, 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; nC, nanocoulombs. 1The abbreviations used are: used: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; MTSET, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate; ND, 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; nC, nanocoulombs. transporter GAT-1, which contains three consecutive glycine residues and is located in the first extracellular loop and is highly conserved in the SLC6 transporter family.

Therefore, the process can be monitored not only by radioactive GABA uptake but also by sodium-dependent GABA-induced steady-state currents reflecting electrogenic GABA translocation (12Kavanaugh M.P.

In addition to these steady-state currents, GAT-1 also mediates sodium-dependent transient currents in the absence of GABA. These transients are thought to reflect a charge-moving conformational change (13Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A.

Moreover, in the absence of both sodium and GABA, GAT-1 mediates cation-leak currents, which are usually monitored in lithium-containing media (16Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3705-3712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G.I. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5405-5414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These currents are suppressed by sodium in a non-competitive manner and probably carried by the sodium-free transporter (16Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3705-3712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20MacAulay N. Zeuthen T. Gether U. J. Physiol. 2002; 544: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here we describe that mutation of only one of the three external loop 1 glycines of GAT-1, glycine 80, to conserved residues causes the above conformational transitions to become impeded upon removal of sodium. However, this is a conditional loss because these transporter-associated currents can be “rescued” by GABA or by prolonged depolarization. Our results can be explained by a model invoking two distinct conformations of the outward-facing sodium-free transporter. Generation and Sub-cloning of Mutants—Mutations were made by site-directed mutagenesis of the C74A-GAT-1 in the vector pBluescript SK (–) (Stratagene) according to the Kunkel method as described (21Kunkel T.A.

From one of the transformants, single-stranded uracil-containing DNA was isolated upon growth in uridine-containing medium according to the standard protocol from Stratagene using helper phage R408. This yields the sense strand, and consequently mutagenic primers were designed to be antisense. Mutants were subcloned into a construct containing GAT-1 in the oocyte expression vector pOG1 (18Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

The coding and non-coding strands were sequenced between the above two restriction sites.

HeLa cells plated on 24-well plates were infected with recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus vTF7-3 (23Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar) and transfected with cDNA (pBluescript SK– with wild type or mutant transporter inserted downstream to the T7 promoter) using the transfection reagent DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate) as described (24Keynan S. Suh Y.J. Kanner B.I. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Uptake of [3H]GABA into the cells was assayed 18–20 h post-transfection. The wells were washed twice with a solution containing 150 mm choline chloride, 5 mm KP, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, and 0.3 mm CaCl2. Each well was then incubated with 0.4 μCi of [3H]GABA (99 Ci/mmol) in a NaCl transport solution (150 mm NaCl, with KPi, MgSO4, and CaCl2 as above). Transport reactions were carried out for 10 min at room temperature, and the assay was terminated by washing the cells twice with ice-cold NaCl transport solution. Cells were lysed with 1% SDS, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Inhibition Studies with Sulfhydryl Reagents—Before the transport measurements, the cells adhering to 24-well plates were washed twice with 1 ml of the transport medium containing 150 mm choline chloride instead of NaCl. Each well was then incubated at room temperature with 200 μl of the preincubation medium containing the sulfhydryl reagent (the different compositions are indicated in the legend to Fig. 1). After 5 min the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of the transport solution. Subsequently they were assayed for [3H]GABA transport at room temperature (22–26 °C) unless indicated otherwise. The hydrophilic methanethiosulfonate reagents used during the preincubation were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. cRNA Transcription, Injection, and Oocyte Preparation—Capped runoff cRNA transcripts were made from transporter constructs in pOG1 linearized with SacII using mMessage mMachine (Ambion Inc.). Oocytes were removed from anesthetized Xenopus laevis frogs and treated with collagenase (type 1A, Sigma C-9891) until most of the capillaries were absent and injected with 50 nl of undiluted cRNA (around 1 ng/nl) the same or the next day. Oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) with freshly added 2 mm sodium pyruvic acid and 0.5 mm theophylline and supplemented with 10,000 units/liter penicillin, 10 mg/liter streptomycin, and 50 mg/liter gentamycin. Oocyte Electrophysiology—This was done as described (16Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3705-3712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Oocytes were placed in the recording chamber, penetrated with two agarose (1%)-cushioned micropipettes (back-filled with 2 m KCl, resistance varied between 0.5 and 2 megaohms), and voltage-clamped using GeneClamp 500 (Axon Instruments, Inc.) and digitized using Digidata 1200A (Axon Instruments, Inc., Union City, CA), both controlled with the pClamp6 suite (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Currents were acquired with Clampex 6.03 and low pass-filtered at 10 kHz every 0.5 ms. Oocytes were stepped from –140 mV to +60 mV in 25-mV increments using –25 mV as the holding potential. Each potential was held clamped for 500 ms. In the experiments depicted in Fig. 5, the voltage was stepped in 9-mV increments from –160 mV to +11 mV in the case of C74A and from –100 mV to +71 mV for G80C/C74A. In all experiments, after each voltage jump the oocytes were held at –25 mV for 500 ms before jumping to the next voltage. The membrane potential was measured relative to an extracellular Ag+/AgCl electrode in the recording chamber. The recording solution (ND) contained 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. In substitution experiments sodium ions were replaced with equimolar choline or lithium. All electrophysiological experiments shown in the figures are in the absence of MTSET. Cysteine Scanning Mutagenesis—The amino acid residues of the consensus sequence NGGGAF (residues 77–82 in GAT-1), located in the first extracellular loop and conserved throughout the sodium- and chloride-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family, were replaced one at a time by cysteine. This was done in the background of the C74A mutant, because cysteine 74 is the only cysteine in wild type GAT-1 sensitive to modification by impermeant methanethiosulfonate reagents. Using the vaccinia/T7 recombinant virus-based expression system, we have shown previously that the sodium- and chloride-dependent [3H]GABA transport activity of HeLa cells expressing C74A is almost as high as those expressing wild type (6Zhou Y. Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13800-13808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Significant transport activity was exhibited by four of the six cysteine mutants: N77C/C74A, G78C/C74A, G79C/C74A, and A81C/C74A (Fig. 1A). No sodium- and chloride-dependent [3H]GABA uptake could be detected in the case of G80C/C74A and F82C/C74A (Fig. 1A). Surface-biotinylation experiments showed that this was not due to inefficient targeting of G80C and F82C to the plasma membrane (data not shown). The four active cysteine mutants were all functionally affected by a 5-min preincubation with a 0.2 mm concentration of impermeant positively charged sulfhydryl reagent MTSET; in the case of G78C/C74A, G79C/C74A, and A81C/C74A, [3H]GABA uptake was inhibited, whereas that by N77C/C74A was stimulated by the reagent (Fig. 1B). Similar results with the four mutants were obtained upon preincubation with a 1 mm concentration of the negatively charged (2-sulfonatoethyl)methane-thiosulfonate (data not shown). Even though the mutants are in the background of C74A, one possibility that explains the effects by MTSET is that one or more of the mutants might expose a previously inaccessible endogenous cysteine residue. However, the fact that introduction of an alanine or serine residue at these positions did not render the transporters sensitive to MTSET (Fig. 1B) strongly suggests that the introduced cysteines themselves are modified by the sulfhydryl reagent. To assess if the reactivity of N77C, G78C, G79C, and A81C is influenced by the conformation of the transporter, the effect of the three substrates on the sensitivity of the mutants to MTSET was determined. In the case of N77C/C74A the stimulation by MTSET in sodium-containing medium was less than that in its absence. In the presence of sodium, GABA did not have much of an effect, but removal of chloride resulted in a diminished stimulation (Fig. 1C). In G78C/C74A there was not much of an effect of the composition of the external medium on sensitivity to the sulfhydryl reagent, but both in G79C/C74A and A81C/C74A there was a significant protection by sodium, and this protection was diminished either in the presence of GABA or when chloride was removed (Fig. 1C). Effect of GABA on Sodium Transients—Because the lack of [3H]GABA transport of G80C/C74A and F82C/C74A is not due to defective targeting to the plasma membrane, it is possible that one or both of the mutants have a defect in one of the steps of the transport cycle but still may be able to execute some of the other steps. This possibility was addressed by analyzing the ability of the mutant transporters upon expression in X. laevis oocytes to carry out reactions linked to the transport cycle. One of those is the capacitative sodium-dependent transient current that is thought to represent a charge-moving conformational change subsequent to sodium binding to GAT-1 (Refs. 13Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 16Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

When the membrane potential of oocytes expressing wild type GAT-1 was jumped to a range of voltages from –140 to +60 mV (for 500 ms at each voltage) from a holding potential of –25 mV, transient currents were observed in sodium-containing medium (Fig. 2A) but not in sodium-free medium (Fig. 2B). These sodium-dependent transients were inward when the jumps were to potentials more negative than the holding potential and outward when the jumps were to potentials more positive than –25 mV. When the voltage was returned to the holding potential, transients of identical magnitude but opposite sign were observed. These transients are many orders of magnitude slower than expected for the rate of diffusion-limited sodium binding. The transients are rather a readout of sodium binding to the transporters and are thought to represent sodium-dependent charge movements by the transporter through the membrane electric field during the “on” steps and back during the “off” steps (13Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 16Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

It was also shown that when external sodium concentrations were progressively lowered, the contribution of the inward charge movements during jumps from the same holding potential became more and more pronounced, as if at the holding potential less and less sodium was bound to the transporter. Thus at lower extracellular sodium, more negative membrane potentials are required for the transporters to bind sodium. As expected, when after prior sodium removal the oocytes expressing wild type GAT-1 were perfused again with this cation, the transient currents returned (Fig. 2C). The addition of non-transportable solutes, such as l-aspartate, did not have an effect on the transients (Fig. 2D). As observed previously (13Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 16Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1999; 114: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the addition of GABA resulted in an almost complete disappearance of the transient current, which now became a maintained steady-state current (Fig. 2E). This is because, rather than sodium-dependent charge movements into and out of the membrane electric field, now sodium and GABA are transported across the membrane in an electrogenic manner. After GABA was removed, the transients were observed again (Fig. 2F). Although no transient currents were observed with the F82C/C74A mutant, the G80C/C74A transporters did exhibit sodium-dependent transients, but in contrast to the wild type, in 96 mm external sodium they were only observed when the voltage was jumped to positive potentials from a holding potential of –25mV (Figs. 2A and 3A) as if at the holding potential all the mutant transporters were in the sodium-bound state. Indeed lowering the sodium concentration resulted in the transients becoming more and more symmetrical and eventually inward (data not shown, but see Fig. 4). These transients reflect capacitative charge movements because upon return to –25 mV, transients of similar size but opposite sign were observed (Fig. 3A). In the absence of sodium (choline replacement) no transients by G80C were observed (Fig. 3B). Remarkably, when after extensive perfusion with the sodium-free medium, the G80C/C74A oocytes were perfused again with sodium Ringer for as long as 10 min, almost no transients were detected (Fig. 3C), and this remained the same even after the perfusion with sodium was continued for an hour (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when sodium was removed by perfusion with N-methyl-d-glucamine (data not shown). Interestingly, exposure to 1 mm GABA caused a marked and immediate recovery of the transients (Fig. 3E). Half-maximal recovery of the transients was obtained at around 100 μm GABA. This effect of GABA was specific because 1 mm l-aspartate was not able to bring about any recovery of the transients (Fig. 3D). Subsequent removal of GABA caused a further increase of the transients (Fig. 3F). The recovery of the transients upon exposure to GABA was completely dependent on the simultaneous presence of sodium; after exposure to GABA in lithium- or choline-containing media followed by washout of the GABA, the sodium-dependent transients did not recover (data not shown). On the other hand the recovery of the transients by GABA was also observed in the absence of chloride (gluconate substitution, data not shown). Observations similar to those on G80C/C74A were also made when glycine 80 was replaced by alanine and, albeit to a much lesser extent, when the replacement was by serine or threonine. When glycine 80 was replaced by proline or aspartate, no sodium-dependent transients were observed regardless of the presence of GABA (data not shown). This was not due to a targeting defect, at least not in the G80P/C74A mutant, as evidenced by surface-biotinylation experiments (data not shown). The phenomenon of poor recovery of the transients after removal of sodium was neither observed with G78C/C74A nor with G79C/C74A (data not shown).Fig. 4Sodium-dependent transient currents mediated by C74A, G80C/C74A, and G80A/C74A. The oocytes expressing GAT-1-C74A (A and B), G80C/C74A (C and D), and G80A/C74A (E and F) were perfused extensively with choline chloride containing medium. Transient currents were subsequently measured in medium containing 10 mm sodium using choline to maintain isoosmolarity in the absence (A, C, and E) or in the presence of 1 mm GABA (B, D, and F). Shown are non-subtracted traces, typical of six oocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is important to see the full extent of the transients to quantify the phenomenon. However, even at +60 mV the full extent of the transients was not yet observed since their size was still increasing as a function of the voltage (Fig. 3). It is difficult to determine the full extent of the transients of G80C/C74A at 96 mm sodium because at the holding potential all the transporters are in the sodium-bound form, and jumping to potentials more positive than +100 mV is required to obtain the maximal charge movement (data not shown). Such very positive potentials were not well tolerated by most batches of oocytes. At reduced sodium concentrations, less positive potentials should be required to cause dissociation of sodium from the transporters. Therefore, the effect of GABA was determined in a solution containing only 10 mm sodium. Before perfusion with the 10 mm sodium-containing solution, the oocytes were perfused first with a sodium-free solution. The results are given as non-subtracted records to show more clearly the opposite effect of GABA on the transient currents by C74A (Fig. 4, A and B) and the mutants (Fig. 4, C–F). In 10 mm sodium, transients in the G80C/C74A and G80A/C74A mutants were almost undetectable (Fig. 4, C and E), but exposure to 1 mm GABA resulted in the induction of the transients (Fig. 4, D and F). As predicted, the transients by G80C/C74A at 10 mm sodium were symmetrical, in contrast to the outward transients measured at 96 mm sodium (Fig. 2). The size of the transients saturated in the voltage range used (Fig. 4, D and F). Again, the addition of 1 mm l-aspartate did not cause the induction of any transients (data not shown). In the absence of GABA reintroduction of sodium at 10 mm to oocytes that expressed the parent construct C74A resulted in the appearance of transients (Fig. 4A). Because of the reduced sodium concentration, most of the charge movement was observed when the voltage was jumped to negative potentials (compare with Fig. 2 where 96 mm sodium is used). The addition of GABA (Fig. 4B, see also Fig. 2E) resulted in an almost total disappearance of the transient current, which now became a maintained steady-state current because of coupled electrogenic sodium and GABA translocation (13Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These GABA-induced currents are apparent when comparing the steady-state currents at negative potentials in Fig. 4B with those in Fig. 4A. For instance, in this experiment the GABA-induced current at –140 mV was –279.5 nA. In the case of other mutants at position 80, also in the presence of 10 mm sodium small transients could be induced in the serine and threonine replacement mutants by GABA but not in those where glycine 80 was replaced with proline or aspartate (data not shown).

We demonstrate that the sensitivity of prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC-3, to genotoxic treatment (cisplatin and gamma-irradiation) increased several folds when cells were forced to grow in anchorage-independence. This enhanced drug sensitivity was associated with a severe impairment of homologous recombination-directed DNA repair (HRR). The mechanism involves Rad51, which is the major enzymatic component of HRR. The protein level of Rad51 and its recruitment to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were both attenuated. Rad51 deficiency in anchorage-independence was not associated with Rad51 promoter activity, and was not compensated by a constitutive overexpression of Rad51 cDNA. Instead, Rad51 protein level and its ability to colocalize with DSBs were restored in the presence of proteosome inhibitors, or when cells from the suspension cultures were allowed reattachment. Presented results indicate that anchorage-independence sensitizes prostate cancer cells to genotoxic agents; however, it also attenuates faithful component of DNA repair by targeting stability of Rad51. This temporal attenuation of HRR may contribute to the accumulation mutations after DNA damage, and possibly the selection of new adaptations in cells, which survived genotoxic treatment."

DNA replication is a fundamental process in living cells that ensures transmission of genetic information between generations. In prokaryotic organisms, such as enterobacteria, replication starts at a unique origin site called oriC (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W.H. Freeman and Co., New York, NY1992Google Scholar). The oriC provides a defined starting point for DNA replication, where the two parental strands of the DNA double helix separate such that semiconservative replication can be initiated. These functions are achieved by the selection of suitable base sequences in the oriC site and by its interactions with specific origin-binding proteins. The organization of the oriC site in enterobacteria is shown in Fig. 1. The sites labeled R1–R4 contain 9 base pairs each and are the binding sites for the initiator DnaA protein (hence, the sites are also termed DnaA boxes). To the left, there are three tandem 13-mer sites, labeled right (R), 1The abbreviations used are: R, right; M, middle; L, left; DUE, DNA-unwinding element. 1The abbreviations used are: R, right; M, middle; L, left; DUE, DNA-unwinding element. middle (M), and left (L). The base sequences of these sites are highly conserved in enterobacteria (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W.H. Freeman and Co., New York, NY1992Google Scholar, 2Zyskind J.W. Cleary J.M.

The binding induces unwinding and opening of the double helix at the neighboring M and R sites (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W.H. Freeman and Co., New York, NY1992Google Scholar). The resulting “open complex” or “bubble” provides the entry site for DnaB helicase. Two hexameric DnaB molecules, assisted by DnaC protein, assemble onto the open M and R sites (3Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). DnaB encircles the M and R sites and forces the remaining 13-mer site L to unwind also. This event completes formation of the replication bubble, with the two DnaB helicase molecules now in position to unwind the DNA duplex bidirectionally from oriC. The unwinding of the three 13-mer sites is the main event that must precede the onset of replication (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W.H. Freeman and Co., New York, NY1992Google Scholar). The unwinding is specifically localized at the 13-mer sites and is initiated by the long range strain induced in the DNA double helix by binding of DnaA protein to the DnaA boxes. Interestingly, the unwinding occurs even in the absence of origin-binding proteins. Kowalski et al. (4Kowalski D. Natale D.A. Eddy M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9464-9468Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 5Kowalski D. Eddy M.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4335-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) were the first to show that in the absence of replication proteins the three 13-mer sites are specifically cleaved by single-strand-specific nucleases, when placed in supercoiled plasmids. This result demonstrated that DNA supercoiling alone can induce unwinding of the three 13-mer sites. Specific unwinding in the absence of proteins and under negative supercoiling has been identified in a variety of other replication origin and regulatory sites (6Umek R.M. Kowalski D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2486-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Natale D.A. Schubert A.E. Kowalski D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Eddy M.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4335-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The molecular origin of the unwinding properties of DUEs is not yet understood. Several software packages have been developed to analyze the free energy required to unwind and separate the strands of the double helix in various DNA base sequences. Some analyses (10Huang Y. Kowalski D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3819-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 11Huang Y. Kowalski D. BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) use the free energies of dinucleotide steps deduced from DNA-melting experiments (12Breslauer K.J. Frank R. Blocker H. Marky L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3746-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). Other analyses incorporate the energetic coupling that occurs between DNA sites under negative supercoiling (13Benham C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Experimental characterizations of DUEs by high-resolution structural methods have not yet been obtained. In the present work, we have investigated the properties of three DUEs using imino proton exchange and NMR spectroscopy. The combined use of these two approaches allows characterization of the stability and dynamics of the three DNA double helices at the level of individual base pairs (14Gueron M. Leroy J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 383-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 15Russu I.M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 379: 152-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The DNA molecules investigated are shown in Fig. 2. The sequences of the central 13 base pairs (positions 3–15) correspond, respectively, to the sequences of the L, M, and R DUE sites in the oriC of Escherichia coli. Two GC/CG base pairs are added at each end of each duplex to minimize the effects of fraying on the exchange of imino protons. DNA Samples—For each DNA duplex of interest, the two strands were synthesized separately, using phosphoramidite chemistry on an automated DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems model 381A). The six DNA strands were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a PRP-1 column (Hamilton) in 50 mm triethylammonium acetate buffer at pH 7, with a gradient of 5–32% acetonitrile for 39 min, at 60 °C. The counterions were replaced with Na+ by repeated centrifugation (3–4 times) through Centricon YM-3 tubes (Amicon Inc.) using 0.5 m NaCl. The DNA solutions were desalted by repeated centrifugation (8–10 times) against water. The corresponding two strands were annealed by equilibrating them in a water bath at 80 °C for 30 min, followed by slow cooling down. The extinction coefficients were calculated as described by Cantor et al. (16Cantor C.R. Warshaw M.M. Shapiro H. Biopolymers. 1970; 9: 1059-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar): 336 OD260/μmol for L duplex, 329 OD260/μmol for M duplex and 330 OD260/μmol for R duplex. Accordingly, the DNA concentrations in the NMR samples were 1.7 mm for duplex L, 2.0 mm for duplex M, and 1.9 mm for duplex R. All three DNA samples were in 90% H2O, 10% D2O, in 0.1 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA at a pH between 8 and 9. Each DNA sample also contained 1 mm triethanolamine, which was used to measure the pH of the DNA solution in each NMR experiment. The pH was determined directly in the NMR tube from the difference in chemical shifts of the two methylene proton resonances of triethanolamine as we described previously (17Chen C. Russu I.M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). NMR Experiments—The rates of exchange of imino protons with solvent protons were measured by NMR on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer using transfer of magnetization from water (18Coman D. Russu I.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 19Coman D. Russu I.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The water proton resonance was selectively inverted using a Gaussian 180° pulse (6–7 ms). A weak gradient (0.21 gauss/cm) was applied during the exchange delay following water inversion, to prevent the effects of radiation damping upon the recovery of water magnetization to equilibrium. A second Gaussian pulse (2–4 ms) was applied at the end of the exchange delay to bring the water magnetization back to the z axis. The observation was with the Jump-and-Return pulse sequence (20Plateau P. Gueron M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7310-7311Crossref Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). The exchange delays were in the range from 2 to 600 ms. The dependence of the intensity of an imino proton resonance on the exchange delay (t) is given by (15Russu I.M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 379: 152-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), I(t)=I0+[I(0)−I0−A]·e−(R1+kex)·t+A·e−R1w·t (Eq. 1) where I0 is the equilibrium intensity, I(0) is the intensity immediately after the first selective pulse on water, kex is the exchange rate, and R1 is the longitudinal relaxation rate of the observed proton. The factor A is defined as A=[Iw(0)Iw0−1]·kexR1+kex−R1w·I0(Eq. 2) where Iw(0) and I0w are the intensities of the water proton resonance after the inversion pulse and at equilibrium, respectively, and R1w is the longitudinal relaxation rate of water protons. Iw(0), I0w, and R1w were measured in separate experiments. The exchange rate of each imino proton was obtained by fitting the intensity of the corresponding resonance to Equation 1 using a non-linear least-squares program. The exchange rate measurements were carried out as a function of the concentration of ammonia, in the presence of 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm triethanolamine. Increasing concentrations of ammonia were obtained by adding to the DNA sample small aliquots of a stock ammonia solution in 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm triethanolamine at pH 8.0. The final concentration of ammonia in the sample was measured by 14N NMR using a VXR-400 NMR spectrometer. The intensity of the 14N NMR resonance of ammonia was calibrated separately for a range of ammonia concentrations from 0.1 to 4.5 m. The concentration of the ammonia base NH3 was calculated from the total ammonia concentration (C0) as [NH3]=C0·10−pK10-pH+10−pK(Eq. 3) with a pK value of ammonia of 9.40 at 20 °C (21Weast R.C.

Theory of Imino Proton Exchange in DNA—Characterization of the kinetics and energetics of base pair opening in DNA relies upon the exchange of imino protons (N3H in thymines and N1H in guanines) with water protons. In double helical DNA, imino protons are hydrogen bonded and are not accessible to water or exchange catalyst molecules. Therefore, for the exchange to occur, the base pair must open (14Gueron M. Leroy J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 383-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 15Russu I.M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 379: 152-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the opening reaction, the hydrogen bond at the imino group breaks, and the base swings into an open state where the imino proton can be abstracted by water or by exchange catalysts. The exchange rate measured experimentally, kex, depends on the rates of opening and closing of the base pair, kop and kcl, respectively, and on the concentration of exchange catalyst. When the ammonia base NH3 is the catalyst for exchange, like in the present work, this dependence is (14Gueron M. Leroy J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 383-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 22Englander S.W. Kallenbach N.R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1984; 16: 521-655Crossref Scopus (1257) Google Scholar) kex=kop·(k0+kNH3·[NH3])kcl+k0+kNH3·[NH3](Eq. 4) where k0 is the rate of proton transfer from the open state of the base pair in the absence of ammonia, and kNH3 is the rate constant for the transfer of the proton from the open state to NH3. The rates of opening and closing of an individual base pair are obtained by fitting the experimentally measured exchange rate as a function of the concentration of ammonia base to Equation 4. The rate constants kNH3 for DNA double helices have been calculated based on results for isolated mononucleotides (15Russu I.M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 379: 152-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Benight A.S. Schurr J.M. Flynn P.F. Reid B.R. Wemmer D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 377-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), for example, 1·109 m–1 s–1 for imino proton in guanine and 4.3·108 m–1 s–1 for imino proton in thymine, at 20 °C. The equilibrium constant of the opening reaction is calculated from the rates of opening and closing as Kop=kopkcl(Eq. 5) The equilibrium constant Kop provides a measure of the energetic stability of a base pair (15Russu I.M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 379: 152-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Englander S.W. Kallenbach N.R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1984; 16: 521-655Crossref Scopus (1257) Google Scholar); the higher the Kop value, the lower the base pair stability is. Two regimes for imino proton exchange are generally observed depending on the concentration of ammonia base. The EX1 regime occurs at high concentrations of NH3 such that k0 + kNH3 · [NH3] ≫ kcl. In this case, as Equation 4 shows, the exchange is rate-limited by the opening of the base pair. Hence, kex=kop(Eq. 6) and the experimentally measured exchange rate equals the opening rate. Equation 4 can also be approximated as kex=Kop·(k0+kNH3·[NH3])(Eq. 7) when the concentration of ammonia base is small such that k0 + (kNH3 · [NH3]) ≪ kcl. In this regime (EX2 regime), the equilibrium constant of the opening reaction, Kop, can be determined from the linear dependence of the exchange rate on the concentration of ammonia base. The NMR resonances of imino protons in the three DNA duplexes investigated are shown in Fig. 3. The assignments of resonances to individual protons were obtained from nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy experiments as described previously (17Chen C. Russu I.M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 18Coman D. Russu I.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The connectivities in the nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy spectra were those expected for B-DNA conformations of the three duplexes (data not shown). To characterize the opening of individual base pairs in each DNA we have measured the exchange rates of imino protons as a function of the concentration of ammonia base (NH3) at 20 °C. A representative example of these measurements is shown in Fig. 4. As clearly seen, increasing concentrations of ammonia accelerate the exchange, as predicted by Equation 4. The dependence of the exchange rates on ammonia base concentration is illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6. Fig. 5 shows the results for five base pairs, which, in at least two of the duplexes investigated, are the same as in the consensus sequence, namely, GC3, CG6, TA9, TA10, and TA15 (Fig. 2). In duplex R, the exchange rate of G6 imino proton was measured only at low ammonia concentration (i.e. up to 50 mm total ammonia, which corresponds to the EX2 regime of exchange). At higher ammonia concentrations the resonance of this proton shifts slightly upfield and overlaps the G8 imino proton resonance (Fig. 3). As Fig. 5 shows, for several imino protons, such as T9 in R, and T10 and T15 in M, the EX1 regime could not be reached. This is because at increasing ammonia concentrations the exchange of these protons becomes too fast to be measurable by transfer of magnetization, i.e. exchange rate higher than ∼100 s–1. Fig. 6 compares the exchange of imino protons for several base pairs, which have the same nearest neighbors in at least two of the duplexes investigated. The base carrying the imino proton is shown in bold, and its 5′- and 3′-neighboring bases are as follows: 5′-AGA-3′ for guanines and 5′-ATA-3′, 5′-ATC-3′, and 5′-TTG-3′ for thymines. The exchange rate of the T11 imino proton in the R duplex was measured only at low concentrations of ammonia (i.e. up to 75 mm total ammonia). At higher ammonia concentrations, the resonance of this proton shifts slightly upfield and overlaps the imino proton resonances from G2 and G16 (Fig. 3).Fig. 5Dependence of the exchange rates of imino protons on ammonia base concentration for the conserved base pairs GC3, CG6, TA9, TA10, and TA15 in duplex L (circles), duplex M (squares), and duplex R (diamonds).

The results for kop and Kop are summarized in Table I. The table contains only the base pairs whose imino proton resonances can be individually resolved in the NMR spectra (Fig. 2, shown in bold). The first two and the last two GC/CG base pairs are not included, because they are not part of the L, M, or R sites, and the exchange of their imino protons is affected by fraying at the ends of the duplex structure.Table IRates (s–1) and equilibrium constants for base pair opening in the three DNA duplexes at 20 °CPositionL duplexM duplexR duplexBase pairBase contextaThe base carrying the imino proton (bold) and its 5′- and 3′-neighboring bases.kopKop·107Base pairBase contextaThe base carrying the imino proton (bold) and its 5′- and 3′-neighboring bases.kopKop·107Base pairBase contextaThe base carrying the imino proton (bold) and its 5′- and 3′-neighboring bases.kopKop·1073GCCGA23 ± 32.3 ± 0.3GCCGA18 ± 21.9 ± 0.4GCCGA24 ± 32.0 ± 0.24ATATC64 ± 644 ± 15TAATC81 ± 375 ± 26CGAGA25 ± 51.4 ± 0.3CGAGA18 ± 61.3 ± 0.5CGAGAcOnly data in the EX2 regime were obtained due to spectral overlap.1.1 ± 0.27TACTCbThe exchange rate increases beyond the value that can be measured in transfer of magnetization experiments (∼ 100 s-1), and the EX1 regime of exchange can not be reached.91 ± 18ATATA79 ± 548 ± 3GCTGT20 ± 72.2 ± 0.2CGAGAcOnly data in the EX2 regime were obtained due to spectral overlap.1.3 ± 0.19TAATT35 ± 319 ± 2TAGTT138 ± 989 ± 6TACTTbThe exchange rate increases beyond the value that can be measured in transfer of magnetization experiments (∼ 100 s-1), and the EX1 regime of exchange can not be reached.120 ± 1910TATTT16.0 ± 0.528 ± 1TATTCbThe exchange rate increases beyond the value that can be measured in transfer of magnetization experiments (∼ 100 s-1), and the EX1 regime of exchange can not be reached.130 ± 2411TATTA48 ± 2110 ± 3CGAGA17 ± 62.0 ± 0.7ATATAcOnly data in the EX2 regime were obtained due to spectral overlap.77 ± 112ATATA37 ± 139 ± 2TACTAbThe exchange rate increases beyond the value that can be measured in transfer of magnetization experiments (∼ 100 s-1), and the EX1 regime of exchange can not be reached.360 ± 813TAATT15.5 ± 0.95.7 ± 0.4ATATA239 ± 24130 ± 1914TATTT29 ± 142 ± 215TATTG142 ± 7190 ± 3TATTGbThe exchange rate increases beyond the value that can be measured in transfer of magnetization experiments (∼ 100 s-1), and the EX1 regime of exchange can not be reached.340 ± 78GCAGG45 ± 46.0 ± 0.3a The base carrying the imino proton (bold) and its 5′- and 3′-neighboring bases.b The exchange rate increases beyond the value that can be measured in transfer of magnetization experiments (∼ 100 s-1), and the EX1 regime of exchange can not be reached.c Only data in the EX2 regime were obtained due to spectral overlap. Open table in a new tab The results presented in Table I show that the opening of GC/CG base pairs in the three duplexes is significantly different from that of AT/TA base pairs. For GC/CG base pairs most opening rates are ∼20 s–1, whereas the opening equilibrium constants are ∼2·10–7. In contrast, for AT/TA base pairs, the opening rates are much higher and span a wider range of values, namely, from 15 to 240 s–1. Similarly, the opening equilibrium constants are increased relative to those for GC/CG base pairs, and range from 6·10–7 to 340·10–7. It has been generally thought that the ability of the three 13-mer sites to unwind during initiation of DNA replication results from their high AT/TA content, i.e. 84% for the L site and 69% for the M and R sites (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W.H. Freeman and Co., New York, NY1992Google Scholar, 5Kowalski D. Eddy M.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4335-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with this view. They show that the kinetic and energetic propensities for opening of AT/TA base pairs are enhanced relative to those of GC/CG base pairs. Closer analysis of the results in Table I reveals interesting variations in individual opening parameters induced by the base sequence of each duplex. These variations are readily seen if one compares the base pairs that are conserved in the three DUEs. Fig. 2 shows the consensus sequence of the oriC DUE sites in enterobacteria. This consensus sequence was derived by comparing minimal origin sites in E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Erwinia carotovora, and in the distant marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi (2Zyskind J.W. Cleary J.M. Brusilow W.S.A. Harding N.E. Smith D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1164-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The L, M, and R sites in the oriC of E. coli contain 9 (or 10) of the 11 base pairs that constitute this consensus sequence (Fig. 2). The resolution of the NMR spectra allows comparison of opening processes for five of these base pairs in at least two duplexes, namely, GC3, CG6, TA9, TA10, and TA15 (Fig. 5). The exchange rates of guanine imino protons in the conserved GC3 and CG6 base pairs are the same, or very similar, in all three duplexes. Accordingly, the rates and equilibrium constants for opening of these base pairs are also the same, within experimental errors (Table I). In contrast to these guanines, the exchange rates of imino protons in the conserved thymines differ. For all protons shown (i.e. T9, T10, and T15), the exchange rates in the M duplex are consistently higher than those in the L duplex. Furthermore, for T9 imino proton, the exchange rate in the R duplex is higher than that in either the M or the L duplex. These higher exchange rates reflect increases in the rates and/or equilibrium constants for opening of the corresponding AT/TA base pairs in the M and R duplexes relative to the L duplex (Table I). Hence, despite the fact that these AT/TA base pairs are conserved, the rates and equilibrium constants for their opening vary. The implication of this result is that the presence of a given base pair in a certain position of several origin sites does not necessarily ensure that its dynamic or energetic properties are the same. In fact, as our results show, the opening properties of the conserved base pair can vary dramatically depending on the extended base sequence context of the DNA. These variations are especially significant for the L, M, and R sites, because the role of these sites is to open and unwind the DNA for its replication. The differences in the opening parameters of TA9 and TA10 that we observed could be because of the fact that in every duplex each of these base pairs is flanked by a different base pair. For example, TA9 is flanked on one side by an AT base pair in duplex L, by a GC base pair in duplex M, and by a CG base pair in duplex R. Thermal melting studies have shown that the energy of the stacking interactions at a TA base pair varies by up to 1 kcal/mol depending on the neighboring base pair (12Breslauer K.J. Frank R. Blocker H. Marky L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3746-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar, 24SantaLucia J.J. Hicks D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 415-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Based on these results one could expect the rates and equilibrium constants for opening of TA9 to be different in the three duplexes. However, for TA15, the nearest neighbors are the same in L and M. Yet this base pair exhibits different opening parameters in these duplexes (Fig. 5 and Table I). To further characterize these effects of base sequence on base pair opening we have compared several base pairs, which have the same nearest neighbors in at least two of the DUEs investigated. As shown in Fig. 6, for all guanines that are flanked on both sides by adenines (5′-AGA-3′), the exchange rates are the same. This finding parallels the invariance observed for the opening of the conserved GC3 base pair (Fig. 5). Together, the two results suggest that the opening of GC/CG base pairs is mostly determined by the nature of the nearest neighboring base pairs. It is interesting to note also that GC3 and CG6 are part of the sequence 5′-GATC-3′/3′-CTAG-5′, which is the target for methylation at the N6 positions of adenines by Dam methylase. In the oriC of enteric bacteria there are 11 of these Dam sequences, and three of them are located within the DUEs sites investigated here (2Zyskind J.W. Cleary J.M. Brusilow W.S.A. Harding N.E. Smith D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1164-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Methylation of these sequences has been proposed as a mechanism to regulate initiation of DNA replication (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W.H. Freeman and Co., New York, NY1992Google Scholar). Our present results show that the dynamics and energetics of the GC/CG base pairs at the Dam methylation sequences within the DUE sites are insensitive to the surrounding base sequences. In contrast to the guanines, for all AT/TA base pairs shown in Fig. 6, the opening is not a simple function of the nearest neighbors. For example, for the 5′-ATA-3′ near neighbor context, the exchange rates of T13 in duplex M and of T11 in duplex R are both higher than those of T8 and T12 in duplex L. Accordingly, the rates and equilibrium constants for opening of AT13 and AT11 base pairs in the M and R duplexes are larger than those of AT8 and AT12 in the L duplex (Table I). Furthermore, within the L duplex, the rate and the equilibrium constant for opening of AT8 are larger than those of AT12. These results clearly demonstrate that the opening of AT/TA base pairs in the three DNA duplexes is strongly influenced by long range effects of the base sequence. These effects are such that the opening of these base pairs in duplexes M and R is faster and energetically more favorable than that in duplex L. This trend suggests a correlation with the function of the three 13-mer sites in DNA replication. As described in the Introduction, the L, M, and R sites are strategically located in the origin of replication (Fig. 1). The M and R sites are the closest to the DnaA boxes. When DnaA protein binds to the DnaA boxes, the M and R sites unwind. At this stage, the L site, which is located farthest away from the DnaA boxes, is intact (3Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Its unwinding requires intervention of DnaB helicase in complex with DnaC protein. Our results are consistent with this directionality of unwinding; base pair opening in the L site is the slowest and the least favorable energetically, whereas base pair opening in the M and R sites is kinetically and energetically enhanced. This variability does not involve any of the GC or CG base pairs. Instead, our results suggest that the differential stability of the three sites is conferred by AT or TA base pairs. This differential stability cannot be accounted for simply by base composition. The L site, for which base pair opening is the slowest and the least favorable, has the highest AT/TA content among the three sites (i.e. 84% as compared with 69% for the M and R sites). Therefore, the variability in base pair opening must result from the different sequences of AT and TA base pairs in the three duplexes. The exact features of these sequences that are responsible for the observed variability are not known. One possibility is suggested by the fact that the L site contains a continuous tract of nine AT/TA base pairs with the sequence TAT3AT3. The sequence encompasses two shorter tracts AT3, which belong to the family of AnTm tracts. Previous work from this and other laboratories has shown that the opening of AT/TA base pairs in AnTm tracts is much slower, and energetically less favorable, than that of AT/TA base pairs in random base sequence context (25Leroy J.L. Charretier E. Kochoyan M. Gueron M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8894-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 26Moe J.G. Russu I.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27Moe J.G. Folta-Stogniew E. Russu I.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1984-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These properties are present when the tract contains at least four AT/TA base pairs (i.e. n + m ≥ 4) and does not include a 5′-TpA-3′ step. Based on these previous observations we suggest that the base sequence of the L site has been selected in evolution such that two AT3 tracts are present therein. The presence of these tracts stabilizes the double helix and could prevent its unwinding by the binding of DnaA protein to the distant DnaA boxes. In the M and R sites, the number of GC/CG base pairs is larger than in the L site. GC/CG base pairs are found in the 8th and 11th positions, which are variable in the consensus sequence (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the orientation of the TA base pairs in the 13th and 14th positions, which are conserved in the consensus sequence, is changed. The overall consequence of these changes is that the two AT3 tracts are eliminated or shortened to less than four base pairs. As a result, the opening of AT/TA base pairs becomes faster and more favorable than in the L site. In summary, in the present work we have shown that the opening of individual AT/TA base pairs in the three DUEs investigated differs from that of GC/CG base pairs in at least two respects. First, the opening of AT/TA base pairs is significantly more favorable, kinetically and energetically, than that of GC/CG base pairs. Second, the opening of AT/TA base pairs is affected by long range effects of the DNA base sequences, whereas the opening of GC/CG is insensitive to the base sequence beyond that of nearest neighbors. The first difference confirms the earlier proposal that the high content of AT and TA base pairs is necessary to lower the stability and enhance the dynamics of the three DUE sites. The second difference suggests that the sequences of these AT and TA base pairs have been selected by evolution as a means to modulate the energetic stability of the three DUE sites according to their location and function in the origin of DNA replication.

In contrast, transfection of the ErbB-2 carboxy-terminal domain did not induce apoptosis. We have identified a 37-residue segment from the ErbB-2 kinase N-terminal lobe that can strongly induce apoptosis in transfected cells.
