https://openalex.org/W2083726777,"Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), which develop over time in some HIV-1-infected individuals, define critical epitopes for HIV vaccine design. Using a systematic approach, we have examined neutralization breadth in the sera of about 1800 HIV-1-infected individuals, primarily infected with non-clade B viruses, and have selected donors for monoclonal antibody (mAb) generation. We then used a high-throughput neutralization screen of antibody-containing culture supernatants from about 30,000 activated memory B cells from a clade A-infected African donor to isolate two potent mAbs that target a broadly neutralizing epitope. This epitope is preferentially expressed on trimeric Envelope protein and spans conserved regions of variable loops of the gp120 subunit. The results provide a framework for the design of new vaccine candidates for the elicitation of bNAb responses."
https://openalex.org/W1996605319,"Epigenetic Signals The lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a signaling molecule that binds to receptors on the cell surface to initiate biochemical changes that control a range of biological processes from growth and survival to immune reactions. Hait et al. (p. 1254 ) report that S1P can also function by direct binding to the nuclear enzymes, histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1 and 2. The enzyme that generates S1P, sphingosine kinase 2 (ShpK2) is present in the nucleus in complexes with HDAC1 and HDAC2. Generation of S1P and its binding to HDACs inhibited deacetylation of histone. Such histone modification is an epigenetic mechanism that controls gene transcription. Thus, generation of S1P in the nucleus appears to be a signaling mechanism by which cells can control gene expression in response to various stimuli."

Animal studies have shown that the efficacy of extinction learning depends on age. Fear memories in young animals can be permanently erased, but in adults they can be easily recovered after extinction training. Perineuronal nets, the highly organized form of extracellular matrix around inhibitory neurons, mediate the shift from juvenile to adult forms of learning in sensory systems. Gogolla et al. (p. 1258 ; see the Perspective by Pizzorusso ) have discovered that the formation of perineuronal nets in the amygdala coincides with the developmental shift in the ability to erase fear memories by extinction. Removal of perineuronal nets in adult animals re-enabled the erasure of fear memories. Thus, in adults it appears that fear memories are actively protected from erasure by the perineuronal nets."

(p. 1236 ) synthesized 2000 years of proxy data from lakes above 60° N latitude with complementary ice core and tree ring records, to create a paleoclimate reconstruction for the Arctic with a 10-year resolution. A gradual cooling trend at the start of the record had reversed by the beginning of the 20th century, when temperatures began to increase rapidly. The long-term cooling of the Arctic is consistent with a reduction in summer solar insolation caused by changes in Earth's orbit, while the rapid and large warming of the past century is consistent with the human-caused warming."

Rand et al. (p. 1272 ; see the news story by Pennisi and the cover) added a private interaction session after each round of the public goods game during which participants were allowed to reward or punish other members of their group. The outcome showed that reward was as effective as punishment in maintaining a cooperative mindset, and doing so via rewarding interactions allowed the entire group to prosper because less is lost to the costs of punishing."
https://openalex.org/W2106187813,"While sources of magnetic fields - magnetic monopoles - have so far proven elusive as elementary particles, several scenarios have been proposed recently in condensed matter physics of emergent quasiparticles resembling monopoles. A particularly simple proposition pertains to spin ice on the highly frustrated pyrochlore lattice. The spin ice state is argued to be well-described by networks of aligned dipoles resembling solenoidal tubes - classical, and observable, versions of a Dirac string. Where these tubes end, the resulting defect looks like a magnetic monopole. We demonstrate, by diffuse neutron scattering, the presence of such strings in the spin-ice Dy2Ti2O7. This is achieved by applying a symmetry-breaking magnetic field with which we can manipulate density and orientation of the strings. In turn, heat capacity is described by a gas of magnetic monopoles interacting via a magnetic Coulomb interaction."

Despite being predicted to exist, searches in astronomy and in high-energy particle physics experiments for magnetic monopoles (either north or south on their own) have defied observation. Theoretical work in condensed-matter systems has predicted that spin-ice structures may harbor such elusive particles (see the Perspective by Gingras ). Fennell et al. (p. 415 , published online 3 September) and Morris et al. (p. 411 , published online 3 September) used polarized neutron scattering to probe the spin structure forming in two spin-ice compounds—Ho 2 Ti 2 O 7 and Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 —and present results in support of the presence of magnetic monopoles in both materials."
https://openalex.org/W2007222211,"Peeking at Pathogen Response Networks Networks controlling gene expression serve as key decision-making circuits in cells, but the regulatory networks that control dynamic and specific gene expression responses to stimuli are often not well understood. This is particularly true for immune dendritic cells (DCs), which respond to pathogens by mounting elaborate transcriptional responses, and are centrally involved in infectious diseases, autoimmunity, and vaccines. Amit et al. (p. 257 , published online 3 September) explored the transcriptional response of dendritic cells to specific classes of pathogens. The transcriptional subnetworks responsible for mammalian dendritic cell responses to different pathogens were identified, and the function of 100 regulators clarified."

However, due to dissipation processes most of the scenarios studied to date have necessarily looked at ground state phases. Haller et al.

https://openalex.org/W2044378614,"Species that are habitat specialists make up much of biodiversity, but the evolutionary factors that limit their distributions have rarely been considered. We show that in Drosophila, narrow and wide ranges of desiccation and cold resistance are closely associated with the distributions of specialist and generalist species, respectively. Furthermore, our data show that narrowly distributed tropical species consistently have low means and low genetic variation for these traits as compared with those of widely distributed species after phylogenetic correction. These results are unrelated to levels of neutral variation. Thus, specialist species may simply lack genetic variation in key traits, limiting their ability to adapt to conditions beyond their current range. We predict that such species are likely to be constrained in their evolutionary responses to future climate changes."
https://openalex.org/W2105202278,"Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) silence transposons and maintain genome integrity during germline development. In Drosophila, transposon-rich heterochromatic clusters encode piRNAs either on both genomic strands (dual-strand clusters) or predominantly one genomic strand (uni-strand clusters). Primary piRNAs derived from these clusters are proposed to drive a ping-pong amplification cycle catalyzed by proteins that localize to the perinuclear nuage. We show that the HP1 homolog Rhino is required for nuage organization, transposon silencing, and ping-pong amplification of piRNAs. rhi mutations virtually eliminate piRNAs from the dual-strand clusters and block production of putative precursor RNAs from both strands of the major 42AB dual-strand cluster, but not of transcripts or piRNAs from the uni-strand clusters. Furthermore, Rhino protein associates with the 42AB dual-strand cluster,but does not bind to uni-strand cluster 2 or flamenco. Rhino thus appears to promote transcription of dual-strand clusters, leading to production of piRNAs that drive the ping-pong amplification cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1990928498,"Epidermal integrity is a complex process established during embryogenesis and maintained throughout the organism lifespan by epithelial stem cells. Although Wnt regulates normal epithelial stem cell renewal, aberrant Wnt signaling can contribute to cancerous growth. Here, we explored the consequences of persistent expressing Wnt1 in an epidermal compartment that includes the epithelial stem cells. Surprisingly, Wnt caused the rapid growth of the hair follicles, but this was followed by epithelial cell senescence, disappearance of the epidermal stem cell compartment, and progressive hair loss. Although Wnt1 induced the activation of β-catenin and the mTOR pathway, both hair follicle hyperproliferation and stem cell exhaustion were strictly dependent on mTOR function. These findings suggest that whereas activation of β-catenin contributes to tumor growth, epithelial stem cells may be endowed with a protective mechanism that results in cell senescence upon the persistent stimulation of proliferative pathways that activate mTOR, ultimately suppressing tumor formation."
https://openalex.org/W2168695856,"Reigning In Tumor Suppression Mitogenic signaling through phosphoinositide-3 kinase generates the lipid second messenger phosphatidyl inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). The tumor suppressor gene product and lipid phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10) opposes such mitogenic signaling by dephosphorylating PIP3. In a screen for proteins that interact with PTEN, Fine et al. (p. 1261 ) identified P-REX2a, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the RAC small guanosine triphosphatase. Endogenous P-REX2a and PTEN interacted in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and P-REX2a inhibited catalytic activity of PTEN. Thus, like that of many protein phosphatases, the activity of PTEN is kept in check by an interacting protein inhibitor. P-REX2a thus provides a mechanism through which tumor cells may inactivate PTEN."

https://openalex.org/W1996699270,"The magnitude of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses is not fixed but correlates with the severity of infection. Although by definition T cell response size is the product of both the capacity to recruit naïve T cells (clonal selection) and their subsequent proliferation (clonal expansion), it remains undefined how these two factors regulate antigen-specific T cell responses. We determined the relative contribution of recruitment and expansion by labeling naïve T cells with unique genetic tags and transferring them into mice. Under disparate infection conditions with different pathogens and doses, recruitment of antigen-specific T cells was near constant and close to complete. Thus, naïve T cell recruitment is highly efficient, and the magnitude of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses is primarily controlled by clonal expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2071651950,"Fascin-Actin Rab Bristles Rab proteins have diverse functions in directing intracellular traffic and may also affect development. Zhang et al. (p. 1250 ) show that during Drosophila development Rab35 influences the development of bristles, neurosensory structures built upon bundled actin. Rab35 also caused massive actin-rich filopodia protrusions from cultured cells. Activated Rab35 interacted directly with fascin, an actin filament bundling protein, to colocalize near the plasma membrane. When Rab35 was engineered to interact with the surface of mitochondria, it stimulated localized actin assembly in a fascin-dependent manner. Thus, fascin is a Rab35 effector protein that links membrane trafficking regulation to cytoskeleton assembly during development."
https://openalex.org/W2002233417,"Absence of leptin has been associated with reduced skeletal muscle mass in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. The aim of our study was to examine the effect of leptin on the catabolic and anabolic pathways regulating muscle mass. Gastrocnemius, extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscle mass as well as fiber size were significantly lower in ob/ob mice compared to wild type littermates, being significantly increased by leptin administration (P<0.001). This effect was associated with an inactivation of the muscle atrophy-related transcription factor forkhead box class O3 (FoxO3a) (P<0.05), and with a decrease in the protein expression levels of the E3 ubiquitin-ligases muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) (P<0.05) and muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1) (P<0.05). Moreover, leptin increased (P<0.01) protein expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), a regulator of muscle fiber type, and decreased (P<0.05) myostatin protein, a negative regulator of muscle growth. Leptin administration also activated (P<0.01) the regulators of cell cycle progression proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cyclin D1, and increased (P<0.01) myofibrillar protein troponin T. The present study provides evidence that leptin treatment may increase muscle mass of ob/ob mice by inhibiting myofibrillar protein degradation as well as enhancing muscle cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1991859567,"Background Trihelix transcription factors play important roles in light-regulated responses and other developmental processes. However, their functions in abiotic stress response are largely unclear. In this study, we identified two trihelix transcription factor genes GmGT-2A and GmGT-2B from soybean and further characterized their roles in abiotic stress tolerance. Findings Both genes can be induced by various abiotic stresses, and the encoded proteins were localized in nuclear region. In yeast assay, GmGT-2B but not GmGT-2A exhibits ability of transcriptional activation and dimerization. The N-terminal peptide of 153 residues in GmGT-2B was the minimal activation domain and the middle region between the two trihelices mediated the dimerization of the GmGT-2B. Transactivation activity of the GmGT-2B was also confirmed in plant cells. DNA binding analysis using yeast one-hybrid assay revealed that GmGT-2A could bind to GT-1bx, GT-2bx, mGT-2bx-2 and D1 whereas GmGT-2B could bind to the latter three elements. Overexpression of the GmGT-2A and GmGT-2B improved plant tolerance to salt, freezing and drought stress in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Moreover, GmGT-2B-transgenic plants had more green seedlings compared to Col-0 under ABA treatment. Many stress-responsive genes were altered in GmGT-2A- and GmGT-2B-transgenic plants. Conclusion These results indicate that GmGT-2A and GmGT-2B confer stress tolerance through regulation of a common set of genes and specific sets of genes. GmGT-2B also affects ABA sensitivity."

https://openalex.org/W2054662971,"Background Recent studies suggest potential roles of the endocannabinoid system in gastrointestinal inflammation. Although cannabinoid CB2 receptor expression is increased in inflammatory disorders, the presence and function of the remaining proteins of the endocannabinoid system in the colonic tissue is not well characterized. Methodology Cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors, the enzymes for endocannabinoid biosynthesis DAGLα, DAGLβ and NAPE-PLD, and the endocannabinoid-degradating enzymes FAAH and MAGL were analysed in both acute untreated active ulcerative pancolitis and treated quiescent patients in comparison with healthy human colonic tissue by immunocytochemistry. Analyses were carried out according to clinical criteria, taking into account the severity at onset and treatment received. Principal Findings Western blot and immunocytochemistry indicated that the endocannabinoid system is present in the colonic tissue, but it shows a differential distribution in epithelium, lamina propria, smooth muscle and enteric plexi. Quantification of epithelial immunoreactivity showed an increase of CB2 receptor, DAGLα and MAGL expression, mainly in mild and moderate pancolitis patients. In contrast, NAPE-PLD expression decreased in moderate and severe pancolitis patients. During quiescent pancolitis, CB1, CB2 and DAGLα expression dropped, while NAPE-PLD expression rose, mainly in patients treated with 5-ASA or 5-ASA+corticosteroids. The number of immune cells containing MAGL and FAAH in the lamina propria increased in acute pancolitis patients, but dropped after treatment. Conclusions Endocannabinoids signaling pathway, through CB2 receptor, may reduce colitis-associated inflammation suggesting a potential drugable target for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1996151739,"Translocator protein (TSPO) is an 18-kDa cholesterol- and drug-binding protein conserved from bacteria to humans. While surveying for Tspo-like genes, we identified its paralogous gene, Tspo2, encoding an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins that arose by gene duplications before the divergence of avians and mammals. Comparative analysis of Tspo1 and Tspo2 functions suggested that Tspo2 has become subfunctionalized, typical of duplicated genes, characterized by the loss of diagnostic drug ligand-binding but retention of cholesterol-binding properties, hematopoietic tissue- and erythroid cell-specific distribution, and subcellular endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membrane localization. Expression of Tspo2 in erythroblasts is strongly correlated with the down-regulation of the enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. Overexpression of TSPO2 in erythroid cells resulted in the redistribution of intracellular free cholesterol, an essential step in nucleus expulsion during erythrocyte maturation. Taken together, these data identify the TSPO2 family of proteins as mediators of cholesterol redistribution-dependent erythroblast maturation during mammalian erythropoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W2028135301,"The striatum is the major input structure of basal ganglia and is involved in adaptive control of behaviour through the selection of relevant informations. Dopaminergic neurons that innervate striatum die in Parkinson disease, leading to inefficient adaptive behaviour. Neuronal activity of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) is modulated by dopamine receptors. Although dopamine signalling had received substantial attention, consequences of dopamine depletion on MSN intrinsic excitability remain unclear. Here we show, by performing perforated patch clamp recordings on brain slices, that dopamine depletion leads to an increase in MSN intrinsic excitability through the decrease of an inactivating A-type potassium current, IA. Despite the large decrease in their excitatory synaptic inputs determined by the decreased dendritic spines density and the increase in minimal current to evoke the first EPSP, this increase in intrinsic excitability resulted in an enhanced responsiveness to their remaining synapses, allowing them to fire similarly or more efficiently following input stimulation than in control condition. Therefore, this increase in intrinsic excitability through the regulation of IA represents a form of homeostatic plasticity allowing neurons to compensate for perturbations in synaptic transmission and to promote stability in firing. The present observations show that this homeostatic ability to maintain firing rates within functional range also occurs in pathological conditions, allowing stabilizing neural computation within affected neuronal networks."

Earlier we showed that one of the components of this complex, nicastrin (NCT), functions as a receptor for γ-secretase substrates.

Here, we present evidence that Glu-333 directly participates in γ-secretase activity. By normalizing to the active pool of γ-secretase with two separate methods, we establish that γ-secretase complexes containing NCT-E333A are indeed deficient in intrinsic activity. We also demonstrate that the NCT-E333A mutant is deficient in its binding to substrates. Moreover, we find that the cleavage of substrates by γ-secretase activity requires a free N-terminal amine but no minimal length of the extracellular N-terminal stub. Taken together, these studies provide further evidence supporting the role of NCT in substrate recognition. Finally, because γ-secretase cleaves itself during its maturation and because NCT-E333A also shows defects in γ-secretase complex maturation, we present a model whereby Glu-333 can serve a dual role via similar mechanisms in the recruitment of both Type 1 membrane proteins for activity and the presenilin intracellular loop during complex maturation. γ-Secretase is a proteolytic membrane complex that processes a variety of substrates including the amyloid precursor protein and the Notch receptor.

Although PS-NTF or -CTF alone is an adequate measure of active γ-secretase complexes, Chávez-Gutiérrez et al. (17Chávez-Gutiérrez L. Tolia A. Maes E. Li T. Wong P.C. de Strooper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20096-20105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) measured specific activity by normalizing γ-secretase products to the sum of PS1-CTF and PEN-2 presumably due to the levels of PS-NTF/CTF by themselves being at the detection limit of Western blotting with electrochemiluminescence (ECL). Such an approach has caveats, as normalizing to the sum of PS1 and PEN-2 does not represent a measurement of the intrinsic activity per single, active enzyme; rather, this mode of normalization instead skews the data to minimize the effects of the mutations, especially when compounded with the unreliability of ECL measurement at the detection limit of Western blotting. Indeed, normalizing to the amount of mature, active γ-secretase in a rigorous, quantitative manner would be necessary to accurately compare the intrinsic activities of wild-type and mutant enzymes.In this study we used two γ-secretase reconstitution methods, including one that bypasses endoproteolysis and two separate normalization approaches to demonstrate that γ-secretase complexes containing NCT-E333A are indeed intrinsically less active than wild-type NCT. We show that this mutant is deficient in its ability to directly bind to γ-secretase substrates. Moreover, we confirm our observations with a second γ-secretase substrate, C83, which is itself the physiological product of α-secretase cleavage of APP. We also examine a series of substrate truncation mutants and find that γ-secretase can cleave substrates that lack the entire extracellular domain, provided that such substrates also contain a free N-terminal amine. Taken together, we conclude that Glu-333 participates directly in activity after γ-secretase complex maturation. Finally, we put forth a model wherein the dual role of Glu-333 in γ-secretase maturation and substrate recognition could be explained in the context of NCT being a substrate receptor. In this model Glu-333 partakes in the recruitment of not only the ectodomain-shed Type 1 membrane proteins but also of the intracellular loop of PS for its endoproteolysis, a hallmark event of γ-secretase maturation and activation.DISCUSSIONγ-Secretase substrates are first pre-processed by an upstream protease to lose their bulky extracellular domain in a process called ectodomain shedding. Previously, we found that NCT, partly via Glu-333, functions as a γ-secretase substrate receptor by binding to the newly generated N terminus resulting from ectodomain shedding (4Shah S. Lee S.F. Tabuchi K. Hao Y.H. Yu C. LaPlant Q. Ball H. Dann 3rd, C.E. Südhof T. Yu G. Cell. 2005; 122: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). However, a recent study challenged this model, arguing that although mutations of this residue impair γ-secretase activity, the main role of Glu-333 is in the maturation process of γ-secretase rather than directly in activity (17Chávez-Gutiérrez L. Tolia A. Maes E. Li T. Wong P.C. de Strooper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20096-20105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We, therefore, revisited our earlier studies with refined experiments.Here, we show that Glu-333 of NCT does, in fact, directly participate in activity. We measure the production of three γ-secretase products using two separate methods of γ-secretase reconstitution, two different modes of analysis (immunoblotting and ELISA), two different normalization methods (radioligand saturation binding and PS1-NTF levels), and normalizing to the amount of active enzymes to demonstrate that Glu-333 is indeed important in the proteolytic activity to generate Aβ40, Aβ42, and AICD from APP. Importantly, we also establish a novel radioligand saturation assay to sensitively and quantitatively measure the number of active γ-secretase complexes within a given assay. Such a method far exceeds comparable methods using immunoblotting and ECL in both its sensitivity and accuracy and provides a robust standard measurement against which one may compare activity across γ-secretase preparations, isoforms, and mutants.The utilization of the pre-endoproteolyzed PS fragments (NTF/CTF) in γ-secretase reconstitution provided γ-secretase that bypasses the need for the PS endoproteolysis maturation step, which can otherwise complicate interpretation of the results. The γ-secretase complex undergoes a sophisticated series of events in its maturation. These include the preassembly of discreet subcomplexes from the four components, trafficking of the individual and subcomplexes through the ER and Golgi to the plasma membrane, binding of modulators such as Rer1p, complex glycosylation of NCT and its subsequent conformational change, and the endoproteolysis of PS within its large intracellular loop (10Dries D.R. Yu G. Curr. Alzheimer Res. 2008; 5: 132-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To represent a pre-matured γ-secretase complex, we chose to use a mimic of PS endoproteolysis by co-expressing the individual fragments PS1-NTF and -CTF together with APH-1, PEN-2, and NCT. Pre-endoproteolyzed PS was chosen for the following reasons. (i) γ-Secretase activity only requires the assembly of the four main components (PS, NCT, APH-1, and PEN-2; Ref 10Dries D.R. Yu G. Curr. Alzheimer Res. 2008; 5: 132-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); (ii) activity does not require the complex glycosylation of NCT (25Herreman A. Van Gassen G. Bentahir M. Nyabi O. Craessaerts K. Mueller U. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); (iii) most PS is found as its endoproteolyzed fragments in vivo (12Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar); (iv) transition state analog inhibitors of γ-secretase bind to the PS fragments (26Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A. Neduvelil J.G. Register R.B. Sardana M.K. Shearman M.S. Smith A.L. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), and (v) expression of PS1-NTF and -CTF in cells and in vivo successfully reconstitutes γ-secretase activity (27Laudon H. Mathews P.M. Karlström H. Bergman A. Farmery M.R. Nixon R.A. Winblad B. Gandy S.E. Lendahl U. Lundkvist J. Näslund J. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Levitan D. Lee J. Song L. Manning R. Wong G. Parker E. Zhang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 12186-12190Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) We, too, show that expression of PS fragments form stable γ-secretase complexes with appropriate subunit stoichiometries and with the proper glycosylation and conformation of NCT. Moreover, radioligand saturation binding indicates similar numbers of γ-secretase active sites between holo-PS1- and PS1-NTF/CTF-containing complexes. Therefore, reconstitution with PS1-NTF and -CTF recapitulates the process of generating mature γ-secretase complexes. Moreover, regardless of whether all of the required maturation steps have been replicated in this system, it provides a way to obtain fully matured, active enzyme.Using these tools, we show that NCT-E333A indeed displays a reduction in intrinsic γ-secretase activity toward several substrates, independent of its role in maturation. Furthermore, we find that the deficiency in activity mainly stems from the reduced ability of NCT-E333A to bind to γ-secretase substrates. However, we wish to emphasize that the effects of the NCT-E333A mutant on γ-secretase are not complete in the active enzyme. Thus, Glu-333 of NCT is important but not essential for γ-secretase activity, and other residues within the DAP domain most likely also contribute substantially to activity. Nevertheless, we find that within NCT, mutation of Glu-333 gives the largest reduction in γ-secretase activity (4Shah S. Lee S.F. Tabuchi K. Hao Y.H. Yu C. LaPlant Q. Ball H. Dann 3rd, C.E. Südhof T. Yu G. Cell. 2005; 122: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). We also wish to point out that, although we demonstrate that Glu-333 of NCT directly participates in γ-secretase activity, we also acknowledge that Glu-333 of NCT participates in γ-secretase complex maturation. In γ-secretase reconstituted with wild-type PS1, PS endoproteolysis is moderately impaired by NCT-E333A (Figs. 1B and 6). Elsewhere, we and others have also shown that NCT-E333A mutant is partially defective in PS endoproteolysis (17Chávez-Gutiérrez L. Tolia A. Maes E. Li T. Wong P.C. de Strooper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20096-20105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 19Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T.

Neurochem. 2004; 89: 1520-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas we, too, find a role for Glu-333 of NCT in γ-secretase complex maturation or activation, our data clearly demonstrate that this residue also participates directly in γ-secretase activity in the mature and active enzyme.A Model for Participation of Glu-333 of NCT in Both γ-Secretase Activity and MaturationHow can Glu-333 doubly participate in both γ-secretase maturation and activity? γ-Secretase substrates sit in the active site of γ-secretase, with their N termini toward the extracellular space (24Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 29Kopan R. Ilagan M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). However, γ-secretase also cleaves itself autocatalytically within the hydrophobic domain VII (HDVII) of PS in the large intracellular loop (11Brunkan A.L. Martinez M. Walker E.S. Goate A.M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 29: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). Therefore, HDVII must adopt a similar topology to substrates and in fact is the first substrate of γ-secretase. Indeed, a peptide representing HDVII can inhibit γ-secretase activity (30Knappenberger K.S. Tian G. Ye X. Sobotka-Briner C. Ghanekar S.V. Greenberg B.D. Scott C.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6208-6218Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and HDVII interacts closely with the γ-secretase active site (31Tolia A. Horré K. De Strooper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19793-19803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, our earlier report showing that NCT-E333A is deficient in activity predicts that PS endoproteolysis would also be affected (4Shah S. Lee S.F. Tabuchi K. Hao Y.H. Yu C. LaPlant Q. Ball H. Dann 3rd, C.E. Südhof T. Yu G. Cell. 2005; 122: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Therefore, our data support an “autoinhibitory model” whereby HDVII of PS occupies its own active site in cis (Fig. 7A). In this model Glu-333 interacts with HDVII during autoinhibition/assembly and with substrates during activity.If HDVII occupies the γ-secretase active site without getting cleaved, then the complex must not be in an active conformation. Maturation of the complex then must trigger the rearrangement of the active site to render it catalytically active (Fig. 7A, lower panel). Indeed, recent data suggests that HDVII adopts distinct conformations with PS holoprotein and endoproteolyzed PS (31Tolia A. Horré K. De Strooper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19793-19803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase activation may include rearrangement of the PS catalytic aspartate residues upon binding of PEN-2 to the complex, which is concomitant with PS endoproteolysis (32Capell A.

Nature. 2003; 422: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Once the active site has been established, HDVII is cleaved and vacates the active site to allow for entry of substrates. This model also explains the pathogenicity of the PS1 familial Alzheimer disease mutant PS1-ΔE9, in which HDVII is deleted (37Perez-Tur J. Froelich S. Prihar G. Crook R. Baker M. Duff K. Wragg M. Busfield F. Lendon C. Clark R.F Neuroreport. 1995; 7: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar); deletion of HDVII would be predicted to alleviate autoinhibition and, thus, render γ-secretase constitutively active. Furthermore, because PS is an endoplasmic reticulum calcium leak channel (38Tu H. Nelson O. Bezprozvanny A. Wang Z. Lee S.F. Hao Y.H. Serneels L. De Strooper B. Yu G. Bezprozvanny I. Cell. 2006; 126: 981-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), occupation of the PS active site by HDVII may also regulate channel activity, analogous to the ball-and-chain model for the gating of potassium channels (39Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 567-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Autoinhibition is common among proteases (40Khan A.R. James M.N. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and this model revisits the hypothesis that PS acts as a zymogen (13Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27348-27353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, because γ-secretase requires a free N-terminal amine on its substrates, this model further suggests that an analogous functionality may dwell on or around HDVII.Glu-333 of NCT Contributes Equally to ϵ- and γ-Secretase Activities; Mechanistic Details on γ-Secretase Catalysisγ-Secretase sequentially cleaves C100 at multiple sites; initial cleavage at the ϵ-site releases the C-terminal AICD, and the resulting N-terminal Aβ49 peptide is further cleaved to yield Aβ42 and Aβ40, which compose the majority of Aβ species and are of particular relevance to the progression of Alzheimer disease (42Zhao G. Tan J. Mao G. Cui M.Z. Xu X. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1234-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 43Qi-Takahara Y. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Dolios G. Hirotani N. Horikoshi Y. Kametani F. Maeda M. Saido T.C. Wang R. Ihara Y. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Our data show that mutation of Glu-333 in NCT to Ala equally affects the production of AICD, Aβ42, and Aβ40. Thus, to exert its effects equally, NCT may either act upstream of catalysis (Fig. 7B, upper panel) or may participate equally in all of the proteolytic events (Fig. 7B, lower panel). We found that the loss in substrate binding with mutant NCT is greater than the loss in activity, suggesting that the identity of this residue may be more critical for the initial recruitment of substrates than it is for catalysis. Therefore, we favor the simpler (first) model in which NCT participates in a step (or steps) upstream of catalysis, which may include movement of substrate to the docking and/or active sites (44Das C. Berezovska O. Diehl T.S. Genet C. Buldyrev I. Tsai J.Y. Hyman B.T. Wolfe M.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 11794-11795Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 45Kornilova A.Y. Bihel F. Das C.

However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the catalysis model, or both models together, may be true.Glu-333 and the Structure of NCTBioinformatics approaches have shown that NCT shares a distant homology with exopeptidases and the transferrin receptor (23Fagan R. Swindells M. Overington J. Weir M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 213-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The equivalent NCT-Glu-333 residue in aminopeptidases is located in the active site and forms a salt bridge with the N-terminal amine of substrates (47Luciani N. Marie-Claire C. Ruffet E. Beaumont A.

Interestingly, others and we have found that substitution of Glu-333 for Asp and Gln retains partial functionality, thus implying that this interaction may involve hydrogen bonding and need not be via a salt bridge (4Shah S.

NCT may have retained its ability to interact with the N terminus of substrates via Glu-333 while losing other key residues critical for proteolytic activity (23Fagan R. Swindells M. Overington J. Weir M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 213-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similarly, there exist several inactive rhomboids, which are catalytically inactive proteases, yet retain chaperone or regulatory functions (49Lemberg M.K. Freeman M.

However, alpha-synuclein oligomerization and aggregation have mostly been detected indirectly in cells using detergent extraction methods [2], [3], [4]. A number of in vitro studies showed that dopamine can modulate the aggregation of alpha-synuclein by inhibiting the formation of or by disaggregating amyloid fibrils [5], [6], [7].Here, we show that alpha-synuclein adopts a variety of conformations in primary neuronal cultures using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). Importantly, we found that dopamine, but not dopamine agonists, induced conformational changes in alpha-synuclein which could be prevented by blocking dopamine transport into the cell. Dopamine also induced conformational changes in alpha-synuclein expressed in neuronal cell lines, and these changes were also associated with alterations in oligomeric/aggregated species.Our results show, for the first time, a direct effect of dopamine on the conformation of alpha-synuclein in neurons, which may help explain the increased vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2068212050,"Increasing biochemical and genetic evidence indicates that the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. We previously reported that RanBP9 promotes Abeta generation by scaffolding APP/BACE1/LRP complexes together. Interestingly, the RanBP9-Delta1/N60 (residues 1-392) deletion mutant interacted much more strongly with APP/BACE1/LRP than full-length RanBP9. In this study, we found that RanBP9-N60, a processed form of RanBP9 virtually identical to the RanBP9-Delta1/N60 mutant, was strongly increased in AD brains compared with controls. To evaluate the potential pathogenic consequences of this phenotype, we studied the differential biological properties of full-length RanBP9 vs. RanBP9-Delta1/N60 in HEK293T and Neuro-2A cells. The RanBP9-Delta1/N60 fragment, which lacks a nuclear localization signal, displayed enhanced cytoplasmic vs. nuclear localization and >3-fold enhanced stability than full-length RanBP9. Importantly, RanBP9-Delta1/N60, which contains the LisH dimerization domain, retained the capacity to form self-interacting multimeric complexes and increased Abeta generation by approximately 5-fold over vector controls, more potent than the approximately 3-fold increase seen by full-length RanBP9. Taken together, these data indicate that RanBP9-N60 may further drive the amyloid cascade in AD and that the proteolytic processing of RanBP9 may be an attractive therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2081137542,"Membrane cholesterol modulates the ability of glucose to stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells. The molecular mechanism by which this occurs is not understood. Here, we show that in cultured beta-cells, cholesterol acts through phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) to regulate actin dynamics, plasma membrane potential, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Cholesterol-overloaded beta-cells exhibited decreased PIP(2) hydrolysis, with diminished glucose-induced actin reorganization, membrane depolarization, and insulin secretion. The converse findings were observed in cholesterol-depleted cells. These results support a model in which cholesterol depletion is coupled through PIP(2) to enhance both plasma membrane Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space, as well as inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-stimulated Ca2+ efflux from intracellular stores. The inability to increase cytosolic Ca2+ may be the main underlying factor to account for impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in cholesterol-overloaded beta-cells."

https://openalex.org/W2038574237,"Ensemble Modeling (EM) is a recently developed method for metabolic modeling, particularly for utilizing the effect of enzyme tuning data on the production of a specific compound to refine the model. This approach is used here to investigate the production of aromatic products in Escherichia coli. Instead of using dynamic metabolite data to fit a model, the EM approach uses phenotypic data (effects of enzyme overexpression or knockouts on the steady state production rate) to screen possible models. These data are routinely generated during strain design. An ensemble of models is constructed that all reach the same steady state and are based on the same mechanistic framework at the elementary reaction level. The behavior of the models spans the kinetics allowable by thermodynamics. Then by using existing data from the literature for the overexpression of genes coding for transketolase (Tkt), transaldolase (Tal), and phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (Pps) to screen the ensemble, we arrive at a set of models that properly describes the known enzyme overexpression phenotypes. This subset of models becomes more predictive as additional data are used to refine the models. The final ensemble of models demonstrates the characteristic of the cell that Tkt is the first rate controlling step, and correctly predicts that only after Tkt is overexpressed does an increase in Pps increase the production rate of aromatics. This work demonstrates that EM is able to capture the result of enzyme overexpression on aromatic producing bacteria by successfully utilizing routinely generated enzyme tuning data to guide model learning."
https://openalex.org/W2003134522,"HNK-1 (human natural killer-1) glyco-epitope, a sulfated glucuronic acid attached to N-acetyllactosamine on the nonreducing termini of glycans, is highly expressed in the nervous system. Our previous report showed that mice lacking a glucuronyltransferase (GlcAT-P), a key enzyme for biosynthesis of the HNK-1 epitope, showed reduced long term potentiation at hippocampal CA1 synapses. In this study, we identified an alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole propionate (AMPA)-type glutamate receptor subunit, GluR2, which directly contributes to excitatory synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity, as a novel HNK-1 carrier molecule. We demonstrated that the HNK-1 epitope is specifically expressed on the N-linked glycan(s) on GluR2 among the glutamate receptors tested, and the glycan structure, including HNK-1 on GluR2, was determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. As for the function of HNK-1 on GluR2, we found that the GluR2 not carrying HNK-1 was dramatically endocytosed and expressed less on the cell surface compared with GluR2 carrying HNK-1 in both cultured hippocampal neurons and heterologous cells. These results suggest that HNK-1 stabilizes GluR2 on neuronal surface membranes and regulates the number of surface AMPA receptors. Moreover, we showed that the expression of the HNK-1 epitope enhanced the interaction between GluR2 and N-cadherin, which has important roles in AMPA receptor trafficking.

Evidence that actin is in preribosomal subunits and NM1 may control rRNA biogenesis post-transcriptionally prompted us to investigate whether NM1 associates with and accompanies rRNA to nuclear pores (NPC). Ultracentrifugation on HeLa nucleolar extracts showed RNA-dependent NM1 coelution with preribosomal subunits. In RNA immunoprecipitations (RIPs), NM1 coprecipitated with pre-rRNAs and 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNAs, but failed to precipitate 5S rRNA and 7SL RNA. In isolated nuclei and living HeLa cells, NM1 or actin inhibition and selective alterations in actin polymerization impaired 36S pre-rRNA processing. Immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) on sections of manually isolated Xenopus oocyte nuclei showed NM1 localization at the NPC basket. Field emission scanning IEM on isolated nuclear envelopes and intranuclear content confirmed basket localization and showed that NM1 decorates actin-rich pore-linked filaments. Finally, RIP and successive RIPs (reRIPs) on cross-linked HeLa cells demonstrated that NM1, CRM1, and Nup153 precipitate same 18S and 28S rRNAs but not 5S rRNA. We conclude that NM1 facilitates maturation and accompanies export-competent preribosomal subunits to the NPC, thus modulating export.—Obrdlik, A., Louvet, E., Kukalev, A., Naschekin, D., Kiseleva, E., Fahrenkrog, B., Percipalle, P.

https://openalex.org/W2101905443,"Background As availability of primary cells can be limited for genetic studies of human disease, lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) are common sources of genomic DNA. LCL are created in a transformation process that entails in vitro infection of human B-lymphocytes with the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). Methodology/Principal Findings To test for genotypic errors potentially induced by the Epstein-Barr Virus transformation process, we compared single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype calls in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and LCL from the same individuals. The average mismatch rate across 19 comparisons was 0.12% for SNPs with a population call rate of at least 95%, and 0.03% at SNPs with a call rate of at least 99%. Mismatch rates were not correlated across genotype subarrays run on all sample pairs. Conclusions/Significance Genotypic discrepancies found in PBMC and LCL pairs were not significantly different than control pairs, and were not correlated across subarrays. These results suggest that mismatch rates are minimal with stringent quality control, and that most genotypic discrepancies are due to technical artifacts rather than the EBV transformation process. Thus, LCL likely constitute a reliable DNA source for host genotype analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2079551077,"The comprehensive identification of functional transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is an important step in understanding complex transcriptional regulatory networks. This study presents a motif-based comparative approach, STAT-Finder, for identifying functional DNA binding sites of STAT3 transcription factor. STAT-Finder combines STAT-Scanner, which was designed to predict functional STAT TFBSs with improved sensitivity, and a motif-based alignment to minimize false positive prediction rates. Using two reference sets containing promoter sequences of known STAT3 target genes, STAT-Finder identified functional STAT3 TFBSs with enhanced prediction efficiency and sensitivity relative to other conventional TFBS prediction tools. In addition, STAT-Finder identified novel STAT3 target genes among a group of genes that are over-expressed in human cancer cells. The binding of STAT3 to the predicted TFBSs was also experimentally confirmed through chromatin immunoprecipitation. Our proposed method provides a systematic approach to the prediction of functional TFBSs that can be applied to other TFs."
https://openalex.org/W2037851961,"Much of our current understanding about neurodegenerative diseases can be attributed to the study of inherited forms of these disorders. For example, mutations in the presenilin 1 and 2 genes have been linked to early onset familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Using the Drosophila central nervous system as a model we have investigated the role of presenilin in one of the earliest cellular defects associated with Alzheimer's disease, intracellular calcium deregulation. We show that expression of either wild type or FAD-mutant presenilin in Drosophila CNS neurons has no impact on resting calcium levels but does give rise to deficits in intracellular calcium stores. Furthermore, we show that a loss-of-function mutation in calmodulin, a key regulator of intracellular calcium, can suppress presenilin-induced deficits in calcium stores. Our data support a model whereby presenilin plays a role in regulating intracellular calcium stores and demonstrate that Drosophila can be used to study the link between presenilin and calcium deregulation."
https://openalex.org/W1973518241,"Background Recognizing regulatory sequences in genomes is a continuing challenge, despite a wealth of available genomic data and a growing number of experimentally validated examples. Methodology/Principal Findings We discuss here a simple approach to search for regulatory sequences based on the compositional similarity of genomic regions and known cis-regulatory sequences. This method, which is not limited to searching for predefined motifs, recovers sequences known to be under similar regulatory control. The words shared by the recovered sequences often correspond to known binding sites. Furthermore, we show that although local word profile clustering is predictive for the regulatory sequences involved in blastoderm segmentation, local dissimilarity is a more universal feature of known regulatory sequences in Drosophila. Conclusions/Significance Our method leverages sequence motifs within a known regulatory sequence to identify co-regulated sequences without explicitly defining binding sites. We also show that regulatory sequences can be distinguished from surrounding sequences by local sequence dissimilarity, a novel feature in identifying regulatory sequences across a genome.

https://openalex.org/W2046155766,"Background The TH-MYCN transgenic mouse is the most widely used murine model of human neuroblastoma, in which a human MYCN oncogene is targeted to neuroectodermal cells of developing mice under the influence of the rat tyrosine hydroxylase promoter. So far, homozygous transgenic mice have been identified by either Southern blot or quantitative real-time PCR. Principal Findings To establish a simple and reliable genotyping method by conventional PCR, we confirmed the integration of the transgene in the TH-MYCN transgenic mouse by Southern blot and inverse PCR analyses. Our results showed that either five or six copies were found to be inserted in a head-to-tail tandem configuration at a single locus. The MYCN transgene/host DNA junction was sequenced and the integration site was identified at chromosome 18qE4. Finally, we succeeded in designing rapid, simple and reliable genotyping method by common PCR using primers flanking the integrated TH-MYCN transgene. Conclusion We established a simple and reliable genotyping PCR method for determining the integration site of the TH-MYCN transgene that enables all possible genotypes to be distinguished within several hours. TH-MYCN mice are excellent model for human neuroblastoma study, thus our results will largely be useful for facilitating the pace of neuroblastoma study, including in the study of the tumourigenic process, and in the development of therapies to treat patients suffering from neuroblastoma."

Although this cleavage can occur at the surface of endothelial cells, it is currently unknown whether this process involves binding of the ADAMTS13 to the endothelial cell plasma membrane. Using different assay systems, we present evidence that ADAMTS13 binds to endothelial cells in a specific, reversible, and time-dependent manner with a Kd of 58 nm. This binding requires the COOH-terminal thrombospondin type 1 repeats of the protease. Binding is inhibited in the presence of heparin and by trypsin treatment of the cells.

Secretion from the storage granules is stimulated by inflammatory mediators, calcium ionophores, and histamine (5Wagner D.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VWF is a 250-kDa monomer that forms a covalent dimer in the endoplasmic reticulum and then covalent multimers within the Golgi that can be microns in length and millions of daltons in molecular weight (6Fowler W.E.

The plasma metalloproteinase, ADAMTS13, cleaves these ultralarge multimers of VWF to generate smaller fragments that are less thrombogenic.

It is a member of the ADAMTS family that, in general, functions to proteolyze extracellular matrix proteins (12Hurskainen T.L. Hirohata S. Seldin M.F. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25555-25563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The family members have a characteristic domain structure that includes an amino-terminal metalloprotease domain, a disintegrin domain, a thrombospondin type I repeat (TSR), a cysteine-rich domain, and a spacer domain followed by a variable number of additional TSRs. ADAMTS13 concludes with seven additional TSRs and two CUB domains, which are unique to ADAMTS13 within the ADAMTS family (Fig. 1). TSRs are domains of ∼60 amino acids with conserved tryptophans and cysteines that were first identified in thrombospondin-1. In thrombospondin-1, the TSRs have been shown to mediate interactions with CD36, an endothelial cell surface receptor (13Asch A.S. Silbiger S. Heimer E. Nachman R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

When ADAMTS13 is perfused over cells in this system, the VWF is rapidly cleaved, and the visualized strands of VWF with bound platelets are lost. Our work was designed to further characterize the cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13 at the endothelial cell surface. We sought to determine if this proteolytic reaction involves binding of ADAMTS13 to the endothelial cells and, if so, whether such binding enhances the cleavage reaction. Using different assay systems, we find that ADAMTS13 does bind to endothelial cells and that this binding enhances cleavage of VWF as compared with ADAMTS13 in the solution. This suggests that binding of ADAMTS13 to endothelial cells may be physiologically important in decreasing thrombosis. Rabbit polyclonal anti-human VWF was from Dako. Histamine, dextran sulfate, and porcine intestinal mucosa heparin were from Sigma. Anti-V5 epitope antibody is from Invitrogen. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from Lonza Inc. and cultured in EGM-2 (Lonza, Inc.). HUVECs were cultured in 60-mm plates coated with 1% gelatin and used for experiments between passages 3 and 8 or in 6-well plates. Experiments were conducted in M199 Earle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Recombinant ADAMTS13 in pcDNA4/TO was described previously (25Majerus E.M. Anderson P.J. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21773-21778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It contains both a His6 tag and a V5 epitope tag (Fig. 1). COOH-terminal truncation constructs were described previously (25Majerus E.M. Anderson P.J. Sadler J.E. J. Biol.

ADAMTS13 was purified as described previously using nickel-agarose (Qiagen) (26Ricketts L.M. Dlugosz M. Luther K.B. Haltiwanger R.S. Majerus E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17014-17023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), or conditioned medium from cells stably expressing ADAMTS13 was used. The concentration of purified ADAMTS13 was estimated by using an extinction coefficient of 0.7 with the A280. The concentration of recombinant ADAMTS13 in conditioned medium was measured using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the anti-V5 antibody and a chemiluminescent detection system (Millipore) as described previously (25Majerus E.M. Anderson P.J. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21773-21778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, the luminograms were scanned, and the relative amount of protein detected was estimated by densitometry using NIH ImageJ 1.41o, version 10.2 (developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on World Wide Web). The concentration of V5-tagged ADAMTS13 constructs was determined by standardization with the V5-tagged PositopeTM reference protein (Invitrogen) and with the purified recombinant ADAMTS13. HUVECs were harvested from 100-mm tissue culture plates by gently scraping the cells into 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 10 mm phosphate, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4). Endothelial cells were washed and incubated in PBS plus 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min on ice to reduce nonspecific binding. ADAMTS13 (or the appropriate COOH-terminal truncation construct) in the indicated amounts was added and allowed to bind cells for 45 min on ice. A polyclonal anti-full-length VWF antibody (Dako) was added when indicated to HUVECs during this incubation to block the interactions between ADAMTS13 and VWF. Cells were washed two times in PBS, and FITC-labeled V5 epitope antibody (Invitrogen) was added. After incubation for 45 min on ice, the cells were washed twice in PBS and sorted for bound fluorescence using the BD FACScan cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Cells were counted using a hemacytometer after scraping the cells from the plate and pipetting to generate a cell suspension. Viability was assessed in the presence of 0.13% trypan blue (Sigma). Confluent monolayers of endothelial cells in 6-well dishes were washed with 2% BSA in ice-cold M199 and then incubated with the indicated concentrations of ADAMTS13 or metalloprotease domain on ice for the indicated times. After removal of the supernatant containing unbound ADAMTS13 or metalloprotease domain, the cells were washed three times quickly with ice-cold 2% BSA in M199. The cells were lysed on the dish on ice in 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing 1 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and anti-V5 epitope antibody was added to the supernatant for immunoprecipitation. The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotator. 40 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein A-agarose (RepliGen) in Tris-buffered saline was added, and incubation was continued for 60 min. The immunoprecipitated material was washed two times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer and one time with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl. After the addition of 4× sample loading buffer (2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 1% bromphenol blue) and water, the Protein A-agarose beads were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, and the supernatants were then subjected to 6% discontinuous SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to Immobilon P membrane (Fisher). Detection of bound ADAMTS13 was with peroxidase-conjugated anti-V5-epitope antibody and a chemiluminescent detection system (Millipore). For dissociation experiments, recombinant ADAMTS13 in conditioned medium was incubated with the endothelial cells on ice for 2 h. The supernatant was removed, and the cells were washed four times quickly with ice-cold 2% BSA in M199. Ice-cold medium was added to the cells, and incubation continued for the indicated times. The medium was collected, cells were lysed, and ADAMTS13 was detected with immunoprecipitation as above. For concentration dependence experiments, purified recombinant ADAMTS13 was added to the endothelial cells on ice. Purification of ADAMTS13 was done as previously described (26Ricketts L.M. Dlugosz M. Luther K.B. Haltiwanger R.S. Majerus E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17014-17023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Luminograms were scanned, and the relative amount of bound protein was estimated by densitometry using NIH Image 1.41o (developed at National Institutes of Health and available on the World Wide Web). Kd was calculated using Prism (GraphPad) software with best fit obtained for one binding site. HUVECs were grown to confluence in 6-well plates. Cells were incubated in 2% BSA in M199 on ice for 60 min to block nonspecific binding sites. 16.5 nm ADAMTS13 in conditioned medium was added to the cells alone or in the presence of 0.45 μg/μl dextran sulfate or heparin (1.8–180 units/ml), as indicated, for 2 h on ice. Unbound ADAMTS13 was removed by washing three times quickly with ice-cold 2% BSA in M199. Cell lysis, ADAMTS13 immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting were as above. The luminograms were analyzed with NIH Image 1.41o to assess the amount of ADAMTS13 bound. Confluent HUVECs from p100 were scraped from the dish and suspended in PBS. The cells were divided into four equal aliquots. To two aliquots, trypsin was added to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. All were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were washed twice with 500 μl of PBS, and ice-cold conditioned medium containing ADAMTS13 was added. The cells were incubated on ice for 60 min. Unbound ADAMTS13 was removed by washing, and anti-V5 antibody was incubated with the cells overnight at 4 °C on a rotator. Unbound antibody was removed by washing, and 25 μl of a 50% Protein A-agarose slurry was added. After a 2-h incubation, the cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and the beads were washed two times with PBS. The Protein A-agarose beads were incubated in sample loading buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol for 5 min at 95 °C, and the supernatants were subjected to 6% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-V5 antibody as above. Endothelial cells were grown in EGM-2 medium to 70–90% confluence in 60-mm dishes precoated with 1% gelatin. Prior to perfusion, EGM-2 medium was replaced with M199 medium, 2% fetal bovine serum containing 0 or 1 μg/ml ADAMTS13, and then the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, the cells were placed in a closed parallel plate flow chamber with 7.0 ml of M199 medium, 2% fetal bovine serum. 7.0 μl of 25 mm histamine was added to the perfusion medium for a final histamine concentration of 25 μm. The cells were perfused at 37 °C and 10 dynes/cm2 for 15 min, at which time a sample of the perfusate was taken for later immunoprecipitation (0 min). 0 or 1 μg/ml recombinant ADAMTS13 was added to the perfusion medium, and perfusion continued for 60 min. The perfusate was again sampled (60 min). The 0 and 60 min perfusate samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-VWF antibody at 4 °C overnight. 25 μl of a 50% suspension of Protein A-linked agarose beads in Tris-buffered saline was added, and the incubation continued for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The Protein A-agarose beads were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 × g and washed two times with PBS. Bound protein was eluted by boiling in SDS-loading buffer with 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min as described previously. The immunoprecipitated protein was subjected to 6% discontinuous SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to Immobilon P membrane. VWF was detected with the peroxidase-conjugated anti-VWF polyclonal antibody and a chemiluminescent detection system (Millipore). The luminograms were scanned, and the relative amounts of cleaved protein products detected were estimated by densitometry using NIH Image 1.62 (developed at National Institutes of Health and available on the World Wide Web). Newly secreted VWF has been shown to interact with the endothelial cell surface (24Dong J.F. Moake J.L. Nolasco L. Bernardo A. Arceneaux W. Shrimpton C.N. Schade A.J. McIntire L.V. Fujikawa K. López J.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 27Padilla A. Moake J.L. Bernardo A. Ball C. Wang Y. Arya M. Nolasco L. Turner N. Berndt M.C. Anvari B. López J.A. Dong J.F. Blood. 2004; 103: 2150-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). As followed by microscopy, the VWF at the endothelial cell surface decreases over time in the presence of ADAMTS13 (24Dong J.F. Moake J.L. Nolasco L. Bernardo A. Arceneaux W. Shrimpton C.N. Schade A.J. McIntire L.V. Fujikawa K. López J.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Since cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13 occurs at the endothelial cell surface, an interaction of ADAMTS13 with endothelial cells could potentially promote or hinder cleavage of VWF. To determine if ADAMTS13 interacts with human umbilical vein endothelial cells, binding experiments were performed to detect bound ADAMTS13 using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. For these experiments, endothelial cells in suspension were incubated with ADAMTS13 containing a V5 epitope tag or conditioned medium alone on ice. A fluorescein-conjugated anti-V5 epitope antibody was then added, and cells were sorted for fluorescent signal. Only cells preincubated with ADAMTS13 had an increased fluorescent signal consistent with binding of ADAMTS13 to the endothelial cells (Fig. 2A). Because ADAMTS13 binds VWF and VWF is present on endothelial cells, the potential role of VWF in ADAMTS13 binding to endothelial cells was investigated. We have previously shown that a polyclonal antibody directed against VWF will completely block binding of ADAMTS13 to VWF (25Majerus E.M. Anderson P.J. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21773-21778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); this antibody was therefore included in incubations of ADAMTS13 with endothelial cells. Although the anti-VWF antibody inhibited cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13 (data not shown), the inclusion of the antibody had no effect on the binding of ADAMTS13 to cells in FACS experiments, since the tracings are nearly indistinguishable (Fig. 2, compare B with A). Additionally, binding of ADAMTS13 was not affected by the presence of a 10-fold higher concentration of the anti-VWF antibody or by increased secretion of VWF induced by histamine treatment (data not shown). These results indicate that ADAMTS13 interacts with endothelial cells independently of VWF. Using a different approach, recombinant ADAMTS13 or the metalloprotease construct (MP) (Fig. 1) was incubated with endothelial cells on ice for 2 h. Bound protein was then detected by immunoprecipitation with the anti-V5 epitope antibody present on both recombinant proteins after cell lysis. Full-length ADAMTS13 but not MP bound to endothelial cells, indicating that ADAMTS13 binds specifically to endothelial cells (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4). The molar amounts of ADAMTS13 and MP used in the experiment were similar, as is seen in Fig. 3A (compare lanes 5 and 6 (MP duplicates) with lane 7 (ADAMTS13)). To determine the concentration dependence of ADAMTS13 binding, the endothelial cells were incubated with increasing amounts of ADAMTS13. Fig. 3B shows the results of one experiment, and the results of five experiments are plotted (Fig. 3C). The association of ADAMTS13 with the cells was saturable, and the Kd was calculated to be 58 nm with a 95% confidence interval from 33 to 85 nm. After counting the number of cells and measuring the maximal ADAMTS13 molecules bound, the stoichiometry of binding was determined to be 17,187 ± 4861 binding sites/cell. To assess the time course of binding to endothelial cells, recombinant ADAMTS13 was incubated with cells on ice for the indicated times (Fig. 4A). Binding of ADAMTS13 could be detected within 1 min and reached equilibrium in 60 min (Fig. 4). The time course of dissociation was also assessed. Irreversibility of binding may be seen if ADAMTS13 was endocytosed by the cells. Since endocytosis is prevented at temperatures below 12 °C, binding experiments were done at 0 °C (28Weigel P.H. Oka J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2615-2617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ADAMTS13 was bound to cells for 2 h, and unbound material was removed. The cells were then incubated with 2% BSA in M199 for the indicated times. Bound ADAMTS13 decreased over time (Fig. 5A), indicating reversibility. The half-time for dissociation was determined to be about 60 min (Fig. 5B). Binding experiments were also done at 37 °C to determine if temperature affected the Kd, time course, and dissociation (supplemental Fig. S1), and no major differences were noted. Binding experiments were also done in the presence of shear stress and fresh frozen plasma. Binding is detected with shear stress and in the presence of other plasma proteins (compare lanes 1 and 3 with lanes 2 and 4) (supplemental Fig. S2).FIGURE 5Time course of ADAMTS13 dissociation from endothelial cells. 27.5 nm recombinant ADAMTS13 in conditioned medium was incubated with endothelial cells on ice (0 °C) for 2 h after blocking with 2% BSA. Unbound ADAMTS13 was removed by quickly washing with blocking buffer, and the cells were incubated for the indicated time in the presence of anti-full-length ADAMTS13 antibody.

The domain structure of ADAMTS13 and the COOH-terminal truncation constructs used in these experiments are depicted in Fig. 1 (19Zheng X. Nishio K. Majerus E.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30136-30141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 25Majerus E.M. Anderson P.J. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21773-21778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A construct that contained only the metalloprotease and disintegrin domains (MD) failed to bind endothelial cells (Fig. 6A). Inclusion of all domains through TSR6 (MDTCST2–6) showed only minimal binding to endothelial cells (Fig. 6B), but constructs that concluded with TSR7 or TSR8 (MDTCST2–7 and MDTCST2–8) exhibited consistent binding to the cells but less than observed with intact ADAMTS13 (Fig. 6, C and D). This suggests that the COOH-terminal thrombospondin repeats and the CUB domains have a role in the interaction with the endothelial cells. Since binding of hemostatic proteins to endothelial cells can be influenced by heparin (29de Boer H.C. Preissner K.T. Bouma B.N. de Groot P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2264-2268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar), the effect of heparin on binding of ADAMTS13 to endothelial cells was assessed. Recombinant ADAMTS13 alone or in combination with dextran sulfate or an increasing concentration of heparin was incubated with endothelial cells on ice. Bound protein was immunoprecipitated and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, and the results of four experiments were plotted (Fig. 7). Heparin at 1.8 units/ml decreased the binding of ADAMTS13 to endothelial cells 5-fold (Fig. 7, lane 3), and higher concentrations further decreased binding (Fig. 7, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, the negatively charged compound, dextran sulfate, had much less of an effect on binding even at concentrations of 0.45 mg/ml (Fig. 7, lane 2). This suggests that heparin decreases binding of ADAMTS13 to cells in a manner not solely dependent on its negative charge. To determine if binding of ADAMTS13 was dependent on cell surface protein, endothelial cells in suspension were incubated with 0 or 5 μg/ml trypsin for 15 min. After the trypsin was removed, ADAMTS13 was incubated with the cells on ice. Binding of ADAMTS13 to the cells was only detected in the absence of trypsin (Fig. 8, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4). This indicates that ADAMTS13 binds a trypsin-sensitive protein. In theory, binding of ADAMTS13 to endothelial cells could either enhance or inhibit cleavage of VWF. For instance, cleavage could be inhibited if the interaction of ADAMTS13 with the endothelial cell prevented its interactions with VWF. Alternatively, cleavage could be enhanced if binding of ADAMTS13 to the endothelial cells facilitated a productive interaction with VWF. To determine the effect of ADAMTS13 binding to endothelial cells on the cleavage of VWF, the parallel plate flow chamber was used to assess cleavage of newly released VWF by ADAMTS13 under conditions of shear stress. Endothelial cells were incubated with or without ADAMTS13 for 60 min, and then histamine was added to stimulate VWF secretion. The cells were then perfused at 10 dynes/cm2 for 0 or 60 min in the presence or absence of additional ADAMTS13 in the perfusate. Prebinding of ADAMTS13 to cells increased cleavage of VWF (compare Fig. 9A, lanes 2 and 4). The cleavage was not significantly enhanced by including ADAMTS13 in the perfusate after prebinding (compare lanes 4 and 5). The quantity of cleaved VWF products was estimated, and it could be seen that prebinding of ADAMTS13 enhanced cleavage of the VWF by about 3-fold (Fig. 9B). The finding that maximal cleavage occurs with bound ADAMTS13 suggests that cleavage of VWF occurs on endothelial cells. In this study, we have used different techniques to demonstrate binding of ADAMTS13 to endothelial cells. Binding of ADAMTS13 is time- and concentration- dependent and reversible. We have demonstrated that ADAMTS13 binding is sensitive to the addition of heparin and trypsin. Furthermore, binding of ADAMTS13 to the cell surface enhances cleavage of VWF in a perfusion-based assay as compared with ADAMTS13 in the perfusate. In previous studies, transfected ADAMTS13 was not found associated with the cell surface of COS-7 cells or RFL-6 cells, a primary rat lung fibroblast cell line (19Zheng X. Nishio K. Majerus E.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30136-30141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) using biotinylation and biochemical analysis. We studied the interaction of ADAMTS13 with HUVECs because endothelial cells appear to be the site of cleavage of ultralarge VWF newly released from the cells. Endothelial cells are also the primary cell surface with which ADAMTS13 interacts as a plasma protein. HUVECs have been shown to synthesize ADAMTS13 (9Shang D. Zheng X.W. Ai J. Zheng X.L. Blood. 2005; 106: 2562Crossref Google Scholar), but in our studies, we have used recombinant ADAMTS13 tagged with a V5 epitope and an anti-V5 antibody so that endogenous ADAMTS13 is not detected. The epitope tag did not influence the detected binding, since the metalloprotease domain construct that includes the V5 epitope tag did not bind the endothelial cells (Fig. 3A). The dissociation constant (Kd) for binding of ADAMTS13 to the endothelial cell surface was calculated to be 58 nm with 17,187 binding sites/cell. This Kd is ∼10-fold higher than the plasma concentration but indicates that binding should occur under physiological conditions. The time to equilibrium binding occurred within 60 min, with binding detectable after just 1 min (Fig. 4). Since ADAMTS13 is continually present in plasma, endothelial cell binding sites should be occupied at a level consistent with the plasma ADAMTS13 concentration. Binding to endothelial cells was also reversible with 50% dissociation over 60 min (Fig. 5). The construct that contained only the metalloprotease domain failed to bind the endothelial cells detectably (Fig. 3A). Since the same anti-V5 epitope antibody was used to detect binding, this demonstrates the specificity of binding of ADAMTS13. In FACS experiments, constructs that contained the first through the 10th domains (of 14 total), metalloprotease and disintegrin domains (MD), MDT, and MDTCST2–6 (Fig. 6A, data not shown, and Fig. 6B) failed to bind the endothelial cells detectably. There was progressively increased binding however, with the addition of the seventh and eighth TSR (Fig. 6, C and D). Since the binding of MDTCST2–8 (Fig. 6D) failed to reach the levels of binding with full-length ADAMTS13, this suggests that the CUB domains also facilitate the interaction with endothelial cells. Studies by other groups have shown that the CUB domains in cooperation with the carboxyl-terminal TSRs are important for the interaction of ADAMTS13 with VWF under flow conditions, but there has been little understanding of the role of the COOH-terminal TSRs alone in the activity of ADAMTS13 (22Tao Z. Peng Y. Nolasco L. Cal S. Lopez-Otin C. Li R. Moake J.L. López J.A. Dong J.F. Blood. 2005; 106: 4139-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 31Zhang W. Motto D. Ginsburg D. Blood. 2004; 104 (Abstr. 126)Google Scholar). A role for the TSRs in endothelial cell binding would increase our knowledge of how patient mutations may affect activity. Future work will further define the role of the carboxyl-terminal TSRs and determine the effect of the CUB domains on binding of ADAMTS13 to endothelial cells. Previous work has shown that domains through the spacer domain are sufficient for VWF cleavage with urea or guanidine denaturation (19Zheng X. Nishio K. Majerus E.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30136-30141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Soejima K. Matsumoto M. Kokame K. Yagi H. Ishizashi H. Maeda H. Nozaki C. Miyata T. Fujimura Y. Nakagaki T. Blood. 2003; 102: 3232-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), but the COOH-terminal TSRs and CUB domains appear to be important for VWF cleavage under flow conditions (21Zhang P. Pan W. Rux A.H. Sachais B.S. Zheng X.L. Blood. 2007; 110: 1887-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 22Tao Z. Peng Y. Nolasco L. Cal S. Lopez-Otin C. Li R. Moake J.L. López J.A. Dong J.F. Blood. 2005; 106: 4139-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A role for other domains of ADAMTS13 in endothelial cell binding would increase our understanding of the function of these domains. Bound ADAMTS13 increased the cleavage of VWF as compared with the cleavage with ADAMTS13 added with the perfusate. Most of the cleavage occurred when ADAMTS13 was prebound to the cell; inclusion of ADAMTS13 in the perfusate only increased cleavage a small amount (Fig. 9B, compare lanes 4 and 5). This result suggests that in this assay system, cleavage of VWF is mainly by ADAMTS13 on endothelial cells, whereas ADAMTS13 in solution contributes a small effect if any. Since ADAMTS13 in the perfusate maximally binds endothelial cells within 60 min (Fig. 4B), the cleavage of VWF with perfused ADAMTS13 is probably due to binding of the ADAMTS13 within the time of the perfusion. The binding of ADAMTS13 in the perfusate to the endothelial cells within the time of perfusion suggests that the enhancement of cleavage is greater than the 3-fold increase in the graph (Fig. 9B). The cleavage results shown are obtained using an hour of applied shear stress. Dong et al. (24Dong J.F. Moake J.L. Nolasco L. Bernardo A. Arceneaux W. Shrimpton C.N. Schade A.J. McIntire L.V. Fujikawa K. López J.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) previously have shown cleavage of VWF at the endothelial cell surface in the presence of platelets within 5 min using microscopy. Subsequent experiments have shown detectable cleavage of VWF within 10 min using our gel-based detection method (data not shown), demonstrating that the cleavage we see is consistent with the time course of cleavage observed with the microscopy-based detection method. Since platelets enhance cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13, their inclusion may also shorten the time to cleavage (32Shim K. Anderson P.J. Tuley E.A. Wiswall E. Sadler J.E. Blood. 2008; 111: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The increased cleavage of VWF by prebound ADAMTS13 is consistent with other cell-based reactions in hemostasis that include the activation of Factor VII by tissue factor (33Nemerson Y. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 170-176PubMed Google Scholar), the activation of Factor X by Factor VIIIa and Factor IXa (34Ahmad S.S. Rawala-Sheikh R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20012-20016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the activation of thrombin by Factor Va and Factor Xa (35Miletich J.P. Jackson C.M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6908-6916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions that control hemostasis are also cell-based. For example, protein C binds thrombomodulin and thrombin and the endothelial cell protein C receptor on endothelial cells to block conversion of prothrombin to thrombin (36Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antithrombin III also interacts with heparin on cell surfaces to inactivate thrombin, Factor Xa, and others (29de Boer H.C. Preissner K.T. Bouma B.N. de Groot P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2264-2268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar, 38Bono F. Herault J.P. Avril C. Schaeffer P. Lormeau J.C. Herbert J.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 172: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Since VWF is released by activated endothelial cells at the site of vascular injury, regulation of ADAMTS13 activity at the site of VWF release is consistent with the regulation of the coagulation cascade at the endothelial cell membrane, as is seen with antithrombin III and Protein C. Since newly released VWF is in ultralarge forms, which are most active in promoting hemostasis and thrombosis, control of the size of the multimers at the site of release is important for controlling the thrombotic state. Circulating ultralarge VWF is more likely to promote pathogenic thrombosis; cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13 at the site of its release, therefore, regulates the thrombotic potential.

Partanen A. et al.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar demonstrate that breast tissue from BRCA1 mutation carriers contains expanded luminal progenitor cells, suggesting a broader role for BRCA1 in mammary development. Women that harbor germline mutations of BRCA1 experience up to an 80% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer (Narod and Foulkes, 2004Narod S.A. Foulkes W.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The majority of these breast cancers are of the “basal” subtype, which are characterized by the lack of expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER/PRs) and the absence of elevated levels of the EGF family receptor ERBB2/Her2 (Turner and Reis-Filho, 2006Turner N.C. Reis-Filho J.S. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5846-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that these tumors may arise from ER/PR-negative, normal breast stem cells. However, a recent publication by Lim et al., 2009Lim E. Vaillant F. Wu D. Forrest N.C. Pal B. Hart A.H. Asselin-Labat M.L. Gyorki D.E. Ward T. Partanen A. et al.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar in Nature Medicine has questioned the origin of BRCA1-deficient breast tumors (Lim et al., 2009Lim E. Vaillant F. Wu D. Forrest N.C. Pal B. Hart A.H. Asselin-Labat M.L. Gyorki D.E. Ward T. Partanen A. et al.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Using cell-surface protein markers (CD49f, EpCAM) first characterized in mouse mammary tissue (Stingl et al., 2006Stingl J. Eirew P. Ricketson I. Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Choi D. Li H.I. Eaves C.J. Nature. 2006; 439: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar), the authors demonstrate that functional stem (CD49fhi, EpCAM−), luminal progenitor (CD49f+, EpCAM+), and more differentiated mammary cells (CD49f−, EpCAM−) can be isolated from normal human breast tissue. Interestingly, they demonstrate that breast tissue isolated from women who carry germline mutations of BRCA1 contain expanded populations of luminal progenitor cells. Furthermore, the gene expression profile of this tissue as well as that obtained from sporadic “basal” breast cancer most closely resembles the signature expressed by normal luminal progenitor cells. On the basis of these observations, Lim et al. suggest that the aberrant luminal progenitors are the target population for basal tumor development in BRCA1 mutation carriers. Elucidating the cell of origin of BRCA1-deficient and basal cancers is of more than academic interest because these studies have important implications for the development of breast cancer prevention and treatment strategies. On the surface, Lim et al., 2009Lim E. Vaillant F. Wu D. Forrest N.C. Pal B. Hart A.H. Asselin-Labat M.L. Gyorki D.E. Ward T. Partanen A. et al.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar may appear to contradict findings from our group that have suggested that BRCA1 regulates human mammary epithelial cell development at the stem cell level (Liu et al., 2008Liu S. Ginestier C. Charafe-Jauffret E. Foco H. Kleer C.G. Merajver S.D. Dontu G. Wicha M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar); such a role by BRCA1 is a concept proposed by Narod and Foulkes, 2004Narod S.A. Foulkes W.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar. However, when interpreting both sets of studies, it is important to consider the potential role of gene dosage in regulating mammary differentiation. For example, in Lim et al., 2009Lim E. Vaillant F. Wu D. Forrest N.C. Pal B. Hart A.H. Asselin-Labat M.L. Gyorki D.E. Ward T. Partanen A. et al.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, tissue was obtained from BRCA1 mutation carriers who are haplo insufficient. Therefore, these samples carry one normal and one mutated allele of BRCA1, resulting in the expression of ∼50% of the normal protein level. In Liu et al., 2008Liu S. Ginestier C. Charafe-Jauffret E. Foco H. Kleer C.G. Merajver S.D. Dontu G. Wicha M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, we demonstrated that complete knockdown of BRCA1 expression in normal human mammary cells with a BRCA1 siRNA lentivirus expanded the population of cells expressing the stem cell marker Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), as assessed by the ALDEFLUOR assay (Ginestier et al., 2007Ginestier C. Hur M.H. Charafe-Jauffret E. Monville F. Dutcher J. Brown M. Jacquemier J. Viens P. Kleer C.G. Liu S. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 555-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2911) Google Scholar). These stem/progenitor cells were ER negative and expressed mesenchymal markers such as vimentin. The clinical relevance of these findings was demonstrated by the detection of ALDH1-positive acini in breast tissue from BRCA1 mutation carriers. Interestingly, we demonstrated loss of heterozygocity (LOH) for the normal BRCA1 allele in these ALDH1-expressing cell clusters but not in adjacent ALDH1-negative acini (Liu et al., 2008Liu S. Ginestier C. Charafe-Jauffret E. Foco H. Kleer C.G. Merajver S.D. Dontu G. Wicha M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Together, these observations combined with those of Lim et al., 2009Lim E. Vaillant F. Wu D. Forrest N.C. Pal B. Hart A.H. Asselin-Labat M.L. Gyorki D.E. Ward T. Partanen A. et al.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar suggest that the effects of BRCA1 on mammary differentiation may be dose dependent, in that a partial loss may block differentiation at the luminal progenitor stage, whereas a more complete loss of activity leads to stem cell expansion (Figure 1). This model is also supported by other data from the Lim et al. study, which observed the lowest expression of BRCA1 in breast stem cells, an intermediate level in luminal progenitors, and the highest levels in differentiated luminal mammary cells. The observation that the majority of breast tumors from BRCA1 mutation carriers display LOH at the BRCA1 locus and are ER/PR negative is also consistent with this model. Finally, the data of Lim et al., 2009Lim E. Vaillant F. Wu D. Forrest N.C. Pal B. Hart A.H. Asselin-Labat M.L. Gyorki D.E. Ward T. Partanen A. et al.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar indicate that BRCA1 haplo-insufficient cells display phenotypic alterations on the basis of their cell-surface marker expression, despite the fact that the tissue sections themselves appear histologically normal. Although mouse models of BRCA1 deficiency have been highly informative, it is important to distinguish between different models when interpreting the data they produce. In the MMTV-Cre;BRCA1f11/f11;p53f5&6/f5&6 model, utilized by Poole et al., 2006Poole A.J. Li Y. Kim Y. Lin S.C. Lee W.H. Lee E.Y. Science. 2006; 314: 1467-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, Cre recombinase is driven by the MMTV promoter that is primarily expressed in more differentiated luminal cell populations. Unlike the breast cancer that develops in most human BRCA1 mutation carriers, the breast cancers that develop in this model are ER/PR positive (Poole et al., 2006Poole A.J. Li Y. Kim Y. Lin S.C. Lee W.H. Lee E.Y. Science. 2006; 314: 1467-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In contrast, when Cre recombinase is driven by the cytokeratin 14 promoter (K14cre;BRCA1F/+;p53F/F construct) that is expressed in more primitive cells, BRCA1 deletion generates ER/PR-negative breast tumors (Liu et al., 2007Liu X. Holstege H. van der Gulden H. Treur-Mulder M. Zevenhoven J. Velds A. Kerkhoven R.M. van Vliet M.H. Wessels L.F. Peterse J.L. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 12111-12116Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the state of mammary differentiation at which BRCA1 is lost may determine the cellular phenotype of resulting tumors and may account for the differences between ER-positive and -negative cancers found in BRCA1-deficient tumors. Interestingly, Lim et al. observed heterogeneity within the luminal progenitor cell pool, which contains both ER-positive and ER-negative cells. Further investigation will be needed to determine whether both luminal progenitor subpopulations are equally expanded in breast epithelium from BRCA1 mutation carriers. The important role of BRCA1 in DNA replication suggests that expanded stem and/or luminal progenitor populations that have lost BRCA1 expression may serve as targets for further mutational events. In addition, these studies emphasize that both the cell of origin as well as its mutation profile may contribute to the genetic and clinical heterogeneity of human breast cancer and highlight that therapeutic strategies may need to be tailored to specific disease subtypes. Finally, Lim et al. report that the gene expression profile of normal breast epithelium from BRCA1 mutation carriers or cancer cells from sporadic “basal tumors” resembles that of luminal progenitor cells. This is an intriguing observation but does not directly address the question of the cellular origin of these tumors or whether they contain cellular subpopulations with distinct characteristics. Recent research has suggested that breast tumors may contain and be driven by a cellular subpopulation with tumor-initiating or “stem cell” characteristics. These cells, by virtue of their resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, may contribute to treatment relapse and metastasis (Wicha et al., 2006Wicha M.S. Liu S. Dontu G. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). In support of this model, recent studies that examined the gene expression profile of breast tumors before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy revealed that the gene expression signature in the residual surviving cells of both basal and luminal tumors resembles that of “cancer stem cells” (Creighton et al., 2009Creighton C.J. Li X. Landis M. Dixon J.M. Neumeister V.M. Sjolund A. Rimm D.L. Wong H. Rodriguez A. Herschkowitz J.I. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; (in press. Published online August 3, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0905718106Crossref Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Furthermore, consistent with Lim et al., 2009Lim E. Vaillant F. Wu D. Forrest N.C. Pal B. Hart A.H. Asselin-Labat M.L. Gyorki D.E. Ward T. Partanen A. et al.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, this pattern of gene expression resembles the profile recently described as “claudin low,” a molecular subtype of breast cancer that is ER negative but that expresses a number of mesenchymal markers such as vimentin. Interestingly, we have found that human mammary xenografts derived from BRCA1 knockdown cells displayed a similar phenotype (Liu et al., 2008Liu S. Ginestier C. Charafe-Jauffret E. Foco H. Kleer C.G. Merajver S.D. Dontu G. Wicha M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Lim et al.'s finding that basal tumors expressed a predominant gene pattern resembling luminal progenitors suggests that the majority of cells in these tumors are arrested at this stage of development. Future studies will be needed to address the functional importance of individual subpopulations of cells in these tumors. An understanding of the pathways that regulate self-renewal and differentiation of mammary stem and progenitor cells may shed light on how alterations in these pathways generate the diverse molecular subtypes of human breast cancer. Studies such as the one reported by Lim et al. provide important insights into these processes and may suggest new strategies for breast cancer prevention and treatment.

The tetramer-based enrichment approach showed that P65 epitope-specific CD4 T cells emerged at mean frequencies of approximately 500 and approximately 4500 per 10(7) PBL at days 28 and 42, respectively, and at day 63 increased further to approximately 22,000/10(7) PBL after M. tuberculosis infection. Direct tetramer staining showed that the tetramer-bound P65-specific T cells constituted about 0.2-0.3% of CD4 T cells in PBL, lymph nodes, spleens, and lungs at day 63 post-infection. 10-fold expansion of these tetramer-bound epitope-specific CD4 T cells was seen after the P65 peptide stimulation of PBL and tissue lymphocytes. The tetramer-based enrichment approach detected BCG-elicited resting memory P65-specific CD4 T cells at a mean frequency of 2,700 per 10(7) PBL.Our work represents the first elucidation of in vivo kinetics and frequencies for tetramer-bound epitope-specific CD4 T cells in the blood, lymphoid tissues and lungs over times after M. tuberculosis infection, and BCG immunization."

HP is the switch from parental to recombinant base pairs, which requires expansion of inter-base pair spaces. This expansion unavoidably causes untwisting of the parental double-stranded DNA.

However, in vivo, double-stranded DNA is relaxed by bound proteins and thus is an unfavorable substrate for RecA/Rad51. In contrast, Mhr1, an ATP-independent HP protein required for yeast mitochondrial homologous recombination, catalyzes HP without the net untwisting of double-stranded DNA. Therefore, we questioned whether Mhr1 uses a novel strategy to promote HP. Here, we found that, like RecA, Mhr1 induced the extension of bound single-stranded DNA. In addition, this structure was induced by all evolutionarily and structurally distinct HP proteins so far tested, including bacterial RecO, viral RecT, and human Rad51.

HP is a switch from parental dsDNA base pairs to recombinant base pairs involving the ssDNA and the complementary strand of the dsDNA, which form the core of the recombination intermediate, and strand exchange is the unidirectional replacement of a dsDNA strand by the incoming ssDNA. The RecA/Rad51 family of proteins, which include bacterial RecA, archaeal RadA/Rad51, eukaryotic Rad51, and meiosis-specific Dmc1, are essential for HR in their respective organisms, and these proteins can promote ATP-dependent HP and ATP hydrolysis-dependent strand exchange in vitro (see Refs. 5Kuzminov A.

In HP, ATP-bound RecA first binds to ssDNA, and this ssDNA·RecA complex then interacts with dsDNA without homologous recognition. Within the RecA·ssDNA·dsDNA complex, a homologous region is identified (11Shibata T. Cunningham R.P. DasGupta C. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 5100-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The base pair switch in HP is formally carried out by base rotation or base flipping (rotation around the base-sugar bond), either of which requires the expansion of the spaces between neighboring bases or base pairs (see Refs. 7Shibata T.

DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).Electron microscopic studies have shown that RecA/Rad51 proteins form a well conserved right-handed helical filament around ssDNA or dsDNA (13Flory J. Tsang S.S. Muniyappa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 14Stasiak A. Di Capua E. Koller T. J. Mol.

In the absence of ATP, these proteins assemble as a shorter inactive filament (helical pitch, ≈65–85 Å) (16Heuser J. Griffith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Yu X. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 334-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP (or ATPγS, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue), the filament adopts an extended active conformation with a helical pitch of ≈95 Å, and the contour length of ssDNA and dsDNA within the active filament is elongated to the same extent (13Flory J. Tsang S.S. Muniyappa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 14Stasiak A. Di Capua E. Koller T. J. Mol.

This equalized elongation has been inferred to widen the spacing between bases of ssDNA and dsDNA equally in the nucleoprotein filament to facilitate the homologous alignment of both DNA substrates to achieve base pair switching (13Flory J. Tsang S.S. Muniyappa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Previously, we analyzed the three-dimensional structure of the RecA·ssDNA complex in the presence of ATPγS by NMR, which showed that the axial rise per ssDNA base was extended to nearly 5 Å (19Nishinaka T. Ito Y. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 6623-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and that the interconversion of sugar puckers induced horizontal base rotation (20Nishinaka T. Shinohara A. Ito Y. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 11071-11076Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). On the basis of these results, and as there was no other structural information at that time, we proposed a base rotation mechanism to explain the base pair switch in HP by assuming that the ssDNA and dsDNA were extended equally and uniformly (20Nishinaka T. Shinohara A. Ito Y. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 11071-11076Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of the RecA·ssDNA complex has revealed a non-uniformly extended structure for the ssDNA (21Chen Z. Yang H. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2008; 453: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The crystal structure contains “a three-nucleotide segment” (triplet) region and “a long untwisted inter-nucleotide” (inter-triplet) region (see Fig. 4). However, it remains unclear which structure contributes to HP and how it does so.The extension of dsDNA is unavoidably associated with untwisting of the double helix (18Stasiak A. Di Capua E. Nature. 1982; 299: 185-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 20Nishinaka T. Shinohara A. Ito Y. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 11071-11076Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Actually, the dsDNA was shown to be untwisted (unwound) within the homology-independent RecA-ssDNA-dsDNA intermediate of HP described above (22Cunningham R.P. Shibata T. DasGupta C. Radding C.M. Nature. 1979; 281: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Shibata T. Cunningham R.P. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7557-7564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HP mediated by RecA or Rad51 was shown to be extensively stimulated by negative supercoiling of the dsDNA substrate in vitro (24Shibata T. DasGupta C. Cunningham R.P. Williams J.G. Osber L. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7565-7572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Stratton S. Sung P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 563-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This is probably because negative supercoils in the dsDNA substrate would compensate for the positive supercoils generated by the untwisting for HP. Closed circular dsDNA isolated from living cells, including DNA from bacteria, nuclei, or mitochondria of eukaryotic cells, is similarly supercoiled. However, in vivo, the supercoils of cellular dsDNA are relaxed by nucleosome assembly in eukaryotic nuclei and by the binding of HU (26Rouvière-Yaniv J. Yaniv M. Germond J.E. Cell. 1979; 17: 265-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and/or other DNA-binding proteins in bacteria. Thus, dsDNA in vivo is an unfavorable substrate for HP mediated by RecA/Rad51 family proteins.In mitochondria, which do not have RecA/Rad51 family proteins, negative supercoils are relaxed by the binding of TFAM (in mammals) or Abf2 (in yeast) (27Caron F. Jacq C. Rouvière-Yaniv J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 4265-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 28Fisher R.P. Lisowsky T. Parisi M.A. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3358-3367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this in vivo dsDNA state, Mhr1, an ATP-independent HP protein required for mitochondrial HR in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (29Ling F. Shibata T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4730-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) catalyzes HP without the net untwisting of dsDNA, i.e. Mhr1 catalyzes HP with relaxed closed circular dsDNA with similar efficiency as with dsDNA lacking topological constraints (linear dsDNA and closed circular dsDNA in the presence of a topoisomerase) (30Ling F. Yoshida M. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9341-9353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in contrast to what is observed for RecA/Rad51, Mhr1-catalyzed HP is prevented by negative dsDNA supercoiling. The absence of net untwisting of dsDNA appears at first glance to mean HP without the extension of the parental dsDNA. However, HP requires the expansion of inter-base pair spaces for base pair switching as described above, and thus we proposed that right-handed wrapping of dsDNA around Mhr1 with an extended and untwisted configuration allows base rotation for HP (30Ling F. Yoshida M. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9341-9353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, it remained to be experimentally determined whether Mhr1 and RecA/Rad51 share a common or different mechanism for HP.In addition to Mhr1, several proteins that promote HP in vitro in the absence of nucleotide cofactors have been identified. These include the human (hs) Xrcc3·Rad51c/Rad51L2 complex (human Rad51 paralogues; 31Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Nakada M. Eda K. Kagawa W. Takata M. Takeda S. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Some of these proteins are termed recombination mediators, but we refer to them as ATP-independent HP proteins for the purpose of this study (supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast to RecA/Rad51 family members, ATP-independent HP proteins, except for those in the Xrcc3·Rad51C complex, do not exhibit any amino acid sequence homology with RecA/Rad51 proteins or other ATP-independent HP proteins. In addition, ATP-independent HP proteins exhibit significantly different quaternary structures (31Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Nakada M. Eda K. Kagawa W. Takata M. Takeda S. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Proc.

Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 24264-24273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas binding to RecA generates positive supercoils in this substrate. On the other hand, like RecA, RecT was shown to untwist dsDNA during HP (42Noirot P. Gupta R.C. Radding C.M. Kolodner R.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The binding of dsDNA to Mhr1 causes neither untwisting nor twisting (30Ling F. Yoshida M. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9341-9353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, the properties of HP proteins vary considerably except for their HP activities.In this study, we questioned whether the extended structure of ssDNA as seen in the RecA·ssDNA complex is conserved among HP proteins, or whether each HP protein uses a different principle to promote HP. If the extended structure is a common determinant of HP, the different HP proteins are likely to use a common mechanism to promote HP, but their variation may reflect requirements for optimizing HP in different cellular environments. Thus, we focused on the structure of the HP protein-bound ssDNA, an HP intermediate. We determined the three-dimensional structures of ssDNA bound to Mhr1 and of three other evolutionarily distinct HP proteins, ecRecT (ATP-independent, from the λ-like cryptic prophage Rac of E. coli, involved in plasmid HR (43Clark A.J. Sharma V. Brenowitz S. Chu C.C. Sandler S. Satin L. Templin A. Berger I. Cohen A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7673-7682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), Thermus thermophilus (tt) RecO (ATP-independent HP protein in bacteria), and hsRad51 (ATP-dependent, human nuclear homologue of RecA) and compared them with ssDNA bound to ecRecA (E. coli, the prototype of the RecA family; supplemental Fig. S1). This is the first demonstration that diverse HP proteins, both ATP-dependent (RecA/Rad51) and ATP-independent (Mhr1, RecO, RecT), use the non-canonical extended DNA structure as a common intermediate for HP, and this suggests that they use a common mechanism for HP.DISCUSSIONIt is known that RecA and Rad51 proteins untwist dsDNA during ATP-dependent HP reactions (see Introduction), but in previous work (30Ling F. Yoshida M. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9341-9353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) we found that Mhr1 promotes HP without the net untwisting of dsDNA. In addition to Mhr1, some ATP-independent HP proteins with various quaternary structures different from those of RecA, Rad51, or Mhr1 were found in evolutionarily distinct organisms. An important finding in the current work is that a common extended DNA structure with non-canonical features was induced as an intermediate for HP by structurally and evolutionarily distinct HP proteins (ATP-independent HP protein, yeast mitochondrial Mhr1, RecT from a cryptic temperate bacteriophage, bacterial RecO; and ATP-dependent HP proteins, human Rad51 and bacterial RecA; see Table 2 and Fig. 3).The most unique feature of the common DNA structure is a hydrophobic interaction between the 2′ methylene moiety of deoxyribose and the following base instead of base-base stacking (Fig. 3C). Some primitive organisms retain RNA genomes, in which HR rarely occurs (54King A.M. McCahon D. Slade W.R. Newman J.W. Cell. 1982; 29: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), if at all, and recombination is mediated by a copy-choice mechanism (replicative template switch) that does not include HP (55Lai M.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 61-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Chetverin A.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). RNA is unlikely to adopt an extended structure because of the presence of a bulky hydrophilic hydroxyl group at the 2′ position of the ribose moiety (Fig. 5). Experimentally, RNA poorly binds to RecA (19Nishinaka T. Ito Y. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 6623-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and even RNA that bound to an HP protein, ecRecT, did not adopt an extended structure (Fig. 2G). This explains why recombination of the RNA genome is performed by a copy-choice mechanism. Because this type of HR requires single-stranded parental RNAs, it represents a significant challenge to genomic stability. On the other hand, the structural properties of DNA are useful for not only maintaining the integrity of the genome, but also for promoting HP, which is a well regulated yet highly dynamic process and allows for adaptation to changing environments. Thus, DNA has a critical advantage over RNA as a carrier of genetic information (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Model for the prevalence and evolutionary advantage of DNA genomes over RNA genomes. A universal ssDNA structure reduces DNA base stacking and enables bases to rotate easily, thereby providing a mechanism for the homology search process of HR. DNA has a double-stranded structure that is essential for maintaining genome integrity, whereas the ability to undergo HR confers a well regulated dynamic property on DNA. Thus, the structure of DNA is particularly suited for both genomic stability and genomic diversity. RNA is unable to adopt an extended structure and rotate its bases due to steric hindrance between the hydroxyl group of the ribose and its adjacent base. In fact, normal HR does not occur in organisms with RNA genomes. Although the earliest organisms probably used RNA as their genetic material, and some primitive organisms retain an RNA genome and exhibit genomic instability, which most likely contributes to diversity, most organisms now employ DNA. Because HR is facilitated by an extended ssDNA structure that is specific to DNA, the switch to DNA genomes provided a critical evolutionary advantage over RNA for the development of diversity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The extended DNA structure containing a hydrophobic interaction between the 2′ methylene moiety of deoxyribose and the following base was originally found in ssDNA bound to ecRecA (19Nishinaka T. Ito Y. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 6623-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Our current finding indicates that the extended DNA structure is not specific to RecA, but suggests that it is fundamentally important in HR; i.e. unrelated HP proteins employ a common mechanism to catalyze HP at the DNA structural level, independent of their quaternary structures (Fig. 7). This suggestion is somewhat surprising, because HP proteins require a topological state of the dsDNA substrate unique to each HP protein, and because required topological states have been considered to reflect the specificity of each DNA reaction.FIGURE 7Schematic model structures for DNA·HP protein complexes.

Shinohara A. Ito Y. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 11071-11076Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the extended ssDNA conformation, the distance between adjacent bases is longer than that in normal B-form DNA, which disrupts base stacking (Fig. 4C) and permits bases to rotate. These extended DNA structures are also found in the crystal structure of the RecA·ssDNA complex (see Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 4). Superimposition of the solution structures of RecA-bound d(TACG) revealed by NMR and the triplet region of the crystal structure of ssDNA in the RecA5·(dT)15 complex showed that the two structures are similar (Fig. 4A). These structures have clearly different features from B-form DNA, but enable each base to engage in Watson-Crick base pairing. Although the inter-triplet region would also be important for HR mediated by RecA, it is likely to be specific for RecA because it is stabilized by the interaction with the L2 loop (21Chen Z. Yang H. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2008; 453: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The extended structure that we revealed by NMR was observed for all HP proteins tested, probably because its stability is an intrinsic structural property of DNA itself.Because HP involves base pair switches that require extended spaces between base pairs, an extended conformation is also necessary for dsDNA. The extension of dsDNA unavoidably induces the untwisting of the double helix, which generates positive supercoils in the neighboring DNA regions. Consistent with this requirement, negative supercoils of substrate dsDNA, which cancel the positive supercoiling, extensively stimulate HP by RecA and Rad51, as described under the Introduction. The binding of RecT also introduces positive supercoils into dsDNA (42Noirot P. Gupta R.C. Radding C.M. Kolodner R.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, RecA, Rad51, and RecT are optimized to work well on negatively supercoiled dsDNA. Mhr1 promotes HP with relaxed closed circular dsDNA at a much higher efficiency than with negatively supercoiled dsDNA (30Ling F. Yoshida M. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9341-9353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Relaxed closed circular dsDNA accumulates topological constraints by either untwisting or twisting, indicating that Mhr1 catalyzes HP without a net topological change of the dsDNA substrate (30Ling F. Yoshida M. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9341-9353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, the product of Mhr1-catalyzed HP is not a D-loop that contains unpaired strands of parental dsDNA (thus, untwisted), but a stable homologous complex of dsDNA and ssDNA that does not involve untwisting of the parental dsDNA by even a single turn (30Ling F. Yoshida M. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9341-9353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A likely product is parallel triplex that contains recombinant base pairs between incoming ssDNA and the complementary strand from dsDNA, with the displaced strand lying in the major groove (57Vlieghe D. Van Meervelt L. Dautant A. Gallois B. Précigoux G. Kennard O. Science. 1996; 273: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This property is favorable to mtDNA, which is likely to be relaxed because of complex formation between mtDNA and a large amount of TFAM (or Abf2), as described under the Introduction. Thus, Mhr1 is optimized for HP in mitochondria. Likewise, each HP protein is probably optimized to perform HP on dsDNA under local topological conditions. This may explain why multiple HP proteins with significantly different tertiary and quaternary structures arose during evolution (Fig. 7).The topological states of the favorable dsDNA substrate for each HP protein are variable, as described above. Thus, each HP protein may use a different strategy to extend dsDNA to promote HP. RecA/Rad51 proteins form nucleoprotein filaments along DNA that extend dsDNA as well as ssDNA, associated with the untwisting of double helices and positive supercoiling of neighboring DNA regions, which is compensated for by negative supercoiling of the substrate dsDNA. RecT may use a similar strategy (see Ref. 42Noirot P. Gupta R.C. Radding C.M. Kolodner R.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The binding of dsDNA to Mhr1 does not generate net topological constraints, and we proposed that the extension of dsDNA-induced untwisting of a double helix is canceled by the simultaneous right-handed wrapping of dsDNA around Mhr1 (30Ling F. Yoshida M. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9341-9353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The initiation of right-handed wrapping is prevented by negative supercoiling of dsDNA, and, thus, negatively supercoiled dsDNA is an unfavorable substrate for Mhr1. The binding of closed circular dsDNA to hsRad52 induces negative supercoils (41Kagawa W. Kagawa A. Saito K."

https://openalex.org/W2019740931,"Background Many models used in theoretical ecology, or mathematical epidemiology are stochastic, and may also be spatially-explicit. Techniques from quantum field theory have been used before in reaction-diffusion systems, principally to investigate their critical behavior. Here we argue that they make many calculations easier and are a possible starting point for new approximations. Methodology We review the many-body field formalism for Markov processes and illustrate how to apply it to a ‘Brownian bug’ population model, and to an epidemic model. We show how the master equation and the moment hierarchy can both be written in particularly compact forms. The introduction of functional methods allows the systematic computation of the effective action, which gives the dynamics of mean quantities. We obtain the 1-loop approximation to the effective action for general (space-) translation invariant systems, and thus approximations to the non-equilibrium dynamics of the mean fields. Conclusions The master equations for spatial stochastic systems normally take a neater form in the many-body field formalism. One can write down the dynamics for generating functional of physically-relevant moments, equivalent to the whole moment hierarchy. The 1-loop dynamics of the mean fields are the same as those of a particular moment-closure."
https://openalex.org/W2024125960,"1% of the genes of the human malaria causing agent Plasmodium falciparum belong to the heterogeneous var gene family which encodes P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PFEMP1). This protein mediates part of the pathogenesis of the disease by causing adherence of infected erythrocytes (IE) to the host endothelium. At any given time, only one copy of the family is expressed on the IE surface. The cues which regulate the allelic exclusion of these genes are not known. We show the existence of a differential expression pattern of these genes upon exposure to biological stress in relation to their positional placement on the chromosome – expression of centrally located var genes is induced while sub-telomeric copies of the family are repressed - this phenomenon orchestrated by the histone deacetylase pfsir2. Moreover, stress was found to cause a switch in the pattern of the expressed var genes thus acting as a regulatory cue. By using pharmacological compounds which putatively affect pfsir2 activity, distinct changes of var gene expression patterns were achieved which may have therapeutic ramifications. As disease severity is partly associated with expression of particular var gene subtypes, manipulation of the IE environment may serve as a mechanism to direct transcription towards less virulent genes."
https://openalex.org/W2097561421,"Personalized, or genomic, medicine entails tailoring pharmacological therapies according to individual genetic variation at genomic loci encoding proteins in drug-response pathways. It has been previously shown that steady-state mRNA expression can be used to predict the drug response (i.e., sensitivity or resistance) of non-genotyped mammalian cancer cell lines to chemotherapeutic agents. In a real-world setting, clinicians would have access to both steady-state expression levels of patient tissue(s) and a patient's genotypic profile, and yet the predictive power of transcripts versus markers is not well understood. We have previously shown that a collection of genotyped and expression-profiled yeast strains can provide a model for personalized medicine. Here we compare the predictive power of 6,229 steady-state mRNA transcript levels and 2,894 genotyped markers using a pattern recognition algorithm. We were able to predict with over 70% accuracy the drug sensitivity of 104 individual genotyped yeast strains derived from a cross between a laboratory strain and a wild isolate. We observe that, independently of drug mechanism of action, both transcripts and markers can accurately predict drug response. Marker-based prediction is usually more accurate than transcript-based prediction, likely reflecting the genetic determination of gene expression in this cross."
https://openalex.org/W2135423485,"The stability of visual perception is partly maintained by saccadic suppression: the selective reduction of visual sensitivity that accompanies rapid eye movements. The neural mechanisms responsible for this reduced perisaccadic visibility remain unknown, but the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN) has been proposed as a likely site. Our data show, however, that the saccadic suppression of a target flashed in the right visual hemifield increased with an increase in background luminance in the left visual hemifield. Because each LGN only receives retinal input from a single hemifield, this hemifield interaction cannot be explained solely on the basis of neural mechanisms operating in the LGN. Instead, this suggests that saccadic suppression must involve processing in higher level cortical areas that have access to a considerable part of the ipsilateral hemifield."
https://openalex.org/W2012814572,"Background Group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) exhibits a high degree of clinically relevant phenotypic diversity. Strains vary widely in terms of antibiotic resistance (AbR), clinical severity, and transmission rate. Currently, strain identification is achieved by emm typing (direct sequencing of the genomic segment coding for the antigenic portion of the M protein) or by multilocus genotyping methods. Phenotype analysis, including critical AbR typing, is generally achieved by much slower and more laborious direct culture-based methods. Methodology/Principal Findings We compare genotype identification (by emm typing and PCR/ESI-MS) with directly measured phenotypes (AbR and outbreak associations) for 802 clinical isolates of GAS collected from symptomatic patients over a period of 6 years at 10 military facilities in the United States. All independent strain characterization methods are highly correlated. This shows that recombination, horizontal transfer, and other forms of reassortment are rare in GAS insofar as housekeeping genes, primary virulence and antibiotic resistance determinants, and the emm gene are concerned. Therefore, genotyping methods offer an efficient way to predict emm type and the associated AbR and virulence phenotypes. Conclusions/Significance The data presented here, combined with much historical data, suggest that emm typing assays and faster molecular methods that infer emm type from genomic signatures could be used to efficiently infer critical phenotypic characteristics based on robust genotype: phenotype correlations. This, in turn, would enable faster and better-targeted responses during identified outbreaks of constitutively resistant or particularly virulent emm types."
https://openalex.org/W2063751038,"Palladin is an actin cytoskeleton–associated protein which is crucial for cell morphogenesis and motility. Previous studies have shown that palladin is localized to the axonal growth cone in neurons and may play an important role in axonal extension. Previously, we have generated palladin knockout mice which display cranial neural tube closure defect and embryonic lethality before embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5). To further study the role of palladin in the developing nervous system, we examined the innervation of palladin-deficient mouse embryos since the 200 kd, 140 kd, 90–92 kd and 50 kd palladin isoforms were undetectable in the mutant mouse embryo brain. Contrary to the results of previous studies, we found no inhibition of the axonal extension in palladin-deficient mouse embryos. The cortical neurons derived from palladin-deficient mice also showed no significant difference in neurite outgrowth as compared with those from wild-type mice. Moreover, no difference was found in neurite outgrowth of neural stem cell derived-neurons between palladin-deficient mice and wild-type mice. In conclusion, these results suggest that palladin is dispensable for normal neurite outgrowth in mice."
