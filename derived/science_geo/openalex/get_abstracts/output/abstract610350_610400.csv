https://openalex.org/W2801453141,"The prevalence of diabetes, dyslipidemias, and high blood pressure is increasing worldwide especially in low and middle income countries. World Health Organization has emphasized the importance of the assessment of the magnitude of the specific disease in each country. We determined the prevalence and determinant factors of high blood pressure, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemias and metabolic syndrome in Ethiopia. A community based survey was conducted from -April to June 2015 using WHO NCD STEPS instrument version 3.1. 2008. Multistage stratified systemic random sampling was used to select representative samples from 9 regions of the country. A total of 10,260 people aged 15-69 years participated in the study. Blood pressure (BP) was measured for 9788 individuals. A total of 9141 people underwent metabolic screening. The prevalence of raised blood pressure (SBP ≥140 and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg) was 15.8% (16.3% in females and 15.5% in males). The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (FBS ≥ 126 mg /dl) including those on medication was 3.2% (3.5% males and 3.0% females). The prevalence of impaired fasting glucose was 9.1% with ADA criteria and 3.8% with WHO criteria. Hypercholesterolemia was found in 5.2%, hypertriglyceridemia in 21.0%, high LDL cholesterol occurred in 14.1% and low HDL cholesterol occurred in 68.7%. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome using IDF definition was 4.8% (8.6% in females and vs. 1.8% in males). Advanced age, urban residence, lack of physical exercise, raised waist circumference, raised waist hip ratio, overweight or obesity, and total blood cholesterol were significantly associated with raised blood pressure (BP) and diabetes mellitus. Increased waist- hip ratio was an independent predictor of raised blood pressure, hyperglycemia and raised total cholesterol. Our study showed significantly high prevalence of raised blood pressure, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia in Ethiopia. Community based interventions are recommended to control these risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2800656602,"Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) such as superoxide (O2), hydrogen peroxide, lipid hydroperoxides, peroxynitrite, and hypochlorous and hypobromous acids play a key role in many pathophysiological processes. Recent studies have focused on mitochondrial ROS as redox signaling species responsible for promoting cell division, modulating and regulating kinases and phosphatases, and activating transcription factors. Many ROS also stimulate cell death and senescence. The extent to which these processes occur is attributed to ROS levels (low or high) in cells. However, the exact nature of ROS remains unknown. Investigators have used redox-active probes that, upon oxidation by ROS, yield products exhibiting fluorescence, chemiluminescence, or bioluminescence. Mitochondria-targeted probes can be used to detect ROS generated in mitochondria. However, because most of these redox-active probes (untargeted and mitochondria-targeted) are oxidized by several ROS species, attributing redox probe oxidation to specific ROS species is difficult. It is conceivable that redox-active probes are oxidized in common one-electron oxidation pathways, resulting in a radical intermediate that either reacts with another oxidant (including oxygen to produce O2) and forms a stable fluorescent product or reacts with O2 to form a fluorescent marker product. Here, we propose the use of multiple probes and complementary techniques (HPLC, LC-MS, redox blotting, and EPR) and the measurement of intracellular probe uptake and specific marker products to identify specific ROS generated in cells. The low-temperature EPR technique developed to investigate cellular/mitochondrial oxidants can easily be extended to animal and human tissues."

We did a non-blinded cluster-randomised controlled trial in the plains districts of Dhanusha and Mahottari, Nepal to assess the impact on birthweight and weight-for-age z-scores among children aged 0–16 months of community-based participatory learning and action (PLA) women’s groups, with and without food or cash transfers to pregnant women. Methods We randomly allocated 20 clusters per arm to four arms (average population/cluster = 6150). All consenting married women aged 10–49 years, who had not had tubal ligation and whose husbands had not had vasectomy, were monitored for missed menses. Between 29 Dec 2013 and 28 Feb 2015 we recruited 25,092 pregnant women to surveillance and interventions: PLA alone (n = 5626); PLA plus food (10 kg/month of fortified wheat-soya ‘Super Cereal’, n = 6884); PLA plus cash (NPR750≈US$7.5/month, n = 7272); control (existing government programmes, n = 5310). 539 PLA groups discussed and implemented strategies to improve low birthweight, nutrition in pregnancy and hand washing. Primary outcomes were birthweight within 72 hours of delivery and weight-for-age z-scores at endline (age 0–16 months). Only children born to permanent residents between 4 June 2014 and 20 June 2015 were eligible for intention to treat analyses (n = 10936), while in-migrating women and children born before interventions had been running for 16 weeks were excluded. Trial status: completed. Results In PLA plus food/cash arms, 94–97% of pregnant women attended groups and received a mean of four transfers over their pregnancies. In the PLA only arm, 49% of pregnant women attended groups. Due to unrest, the response rate for birthweight was low at 22% (n = 2087), but response rate for endline nutritional and dietary measures exceeded 83% (n = 9242). Compared to the control arm (n = 464), mean birthweight was significantly higher in the PLA plus food arm by 78·0 g (95% CI 13·9, 142·0; n = 626) and not significantly higher in PLA only and PLA plus cash arms by 28·9 g (95% CI -37·7, 95·4; n = 488) and 50·5 g (95% CI -15·0, 116·1; n = 509) respectively. Mean weight-for-age z-scores of children aged 0–16 months (average age 9 months) sampled cross-sectionally at endpoint, were not significantly different from those in the control arm (n = 2091). Differences in weight for-age z-score were as follows: PLA only -0·026 (95% CI -0·117, 0·065; n = 2095); PLA plus cash -0·045 (95% CI -0·133, 0·044; n = 2545); PLA plus food -0·033 (95% CI -0·121, 0·056; n = 2507). Amongst many secondary outcomes tested, compared with control, more institutional deliveries (OR: 1.46 95% CI 1.03, 2.06; n = 2651) and less colostrum discarding (OR:0.71 95% CI 0.54, 0.93; n = 2548) were found in the PLA plus food arm but not in PLA alone or in PLA plus cash arms. Interpretation Food supplements in pregnancy with PLA women’s groups increased birthweight more than PLA plus cash or PLA alone but differences were not sustained. Nutrition interventions throughout the thousand-day period are recommended. Trial registration ISRCTN75964374."
https://openalex.org/W2799868609,"Introduction White matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume on MRI is increased among presymptomatic individuals with autosomal dominant mutations for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). One potential explanation is that WMH, conventionally considered a marker of cerebrovascular disease, are a reflection of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and that increased WMH in this population is a manifestation of this vascular form of primary AD pathology. We examined whether the presence of cerebral microbleeds, a marker of CAA, mediates the relationship between WMH and estimated symptom onset in individuals with and without autosomal dominant mutations for AD. Participants and methods Participants (n = 175, mean age = 41.1 years) included 112 with an AD mutation and 63 first-degree non-carrier controls. We calculated the estimated years from expected symptom onset (EYO) and analyzed baseline MRI data for WMH volume and presence of cerebral microbleeds. Mixed effects regression and tests of mediation were used to examine microbleed and WMH differences between carriers and non-carriers and to test the whether the association between WMH and mutation status is dependent on the presence of microbleeds. Results Mutation carriers were more likely to have microbleeds than non-carriers (p<0.05) and individuals with microbleeds had higher WMH volume than those without (p<0.05). Total WMH volume was increased in mutation carriers compared with non-carriers, up to 20 years prior to EYO, after controlling for microbleed status, as we demonstrated previously. Formal testing of mediation demonstrated that 21% of the association between mutation status and WMH was mediated by presence of microbleeds (p = 0.03) but a significant direct effect of WMH remained (p = 0.02) after controlling for presence of microbleeds. Discussion Although there is some co-dependency between WMH and microbleeds, the observed increases in WMH among mutation carriers does not appear to be fully mediated by this marker of CAA. The findings highlight the possibility that WMH represent a core feature of AD independent of vascular forms of beta amyloid."
https://openalex.org/W2802665663,"The ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73 degrade extracellular ATP to adenosine. ATP is released by stressed or damaged cells and provides pro-inflammatory signals to immune cells through P2 receptors. Adenosine, on the other hand, suppresses immune cells by stimulating P1 receptors. Thus, CD39 and CD73 can shape the quality of immune responses. Here we demonstrate that upregulation of CD39 is a consistent feature of activated conventional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Following stimulation in vitro, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from human blood gained surface expression of CD39 but displayed only low levels of CD73. Activated human T cells from inflamed joints largely presented with a CD39+CD73- phenotype. In line, in spleens of mice with acute Listeria monocytogenes, listeria-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells acquired a CD39+CD73- phenotype. To test the function of CD39 in control of bacterial infection, CD39-deficient (CD39-/-) mice were infected with L. monocytogenes. CD39-/- mice showed better initial control of L. monocytogenes, which was associated with enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines. In the late stage of infection, CD39-/- mice accumulated more listeria-specific CD8+ T cells in the spleen than wildtype animals suggesting that CD39 attenuates the CD8+ T-cell response to infection. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that CD39 is upregulated on conventional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at sites of acute infection and inflammation, and that CD39 dampens responses to bacterial infection."
https://openalex.org/W2799600259,"Particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) is a copper-dependent integral membrane metalloenzyme that converts methane to methanol in methanotrophic bacteria. Studies of isolated pMMO have been hindered by loss of enzymatic activity upon its removal from the native membrane. To characterize pMMO in a membrane-like environment, we reconstituted pMMOs from Methylococcus (Mcc.) capsulatus (Bath) and Methylomicrobium (Mm.) alcaliphilum 20Z into bicelles. Reconstitution into bicelles recovers methane oxidation activity lost upon detergent solubilization and purification without substantial alterations to copper content or copper electronic structure, as observed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. These findings suggest that loss of pMMO activity upon isolation is due to removal from the membranes rather than caused by loss of the catalytic copper ions. A 2.7 A resolution crystal structure of pMMO from Mm. alcaliphilum 20Z reveals a mononuclear copper center in the PmoB subunit and indicates that the transmembrane PmoC subunit may be conformationally flexible. Finally, results from extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis of pMMO from Mm. alcaliphilum 20Z were consistent with the observed monocopper center in the PmoB subunit. These results underscore the importance of studying membrane proteins in a membrane-like environment and provide valuable insight into pMMO function."
https://openalex.org/W2799941152,"Despite their importance in marine food webs, much has yet to be learned about the spatial ecology of small seabirds. This includes the Leach’s storm-petrel Oceanodroma leucorhoa, a species that is declining throughout its Northwest Atlantic breeding range. In 2013 and 2014, we used global location sensors to track foraging movements of incubating storm-petrels from 7 eastern Canadian breeding colonies. We determined and compared the foraging trip and at-sea habitat characteristics, analysed spatial overlap among colonies, and determined whether colony foraging ranges intersected with offshore oil and gas operations. Individuals tracked during the incubation period made 4.0 ± 1.4 day foraging trips, travelling to highly pelagic waters over and beyond continental slopes which ranged, on average, 400 to 830 km from colonies. Cumulative travel distances ranged from ~900 to 2,100 km among colonies. While colony size did not influence foraging trip characteristics or the size of areas used at sea, foraging distances tended to be shorter for individuals breeding at the southern end of the range. Core areas did not overlap considerably among colonies, and individuals from all sites except Kent Island in the Bay of Fundy foraged over waters with median depths > 1,950 m and average chlorophyll a concentrations ≤ 0.6 mg/m3. Sea surface temperatures within colony core areas varied considerably (11–23°C), coincident with the birds’ use of cold waters of the Labrador Current or warmer waters of the Gulf Stream Current. Offshore oil and gas operations intersected with the foraging ranges of 5 of 7 colonies. Three of these, including Baccalieu Island, Newfoundland, which supports the species’ largest population, have experienced substantial declines in the last few decades. Future work should prioritize modelling efforts to incorporate information on relative predation risk at colonies, spatially explicit risks at-sea on the breeding and wintering grounds, effects of climate and marine ecosystem change, as well as lethal and sub-lethal effects of environmental contaminants, to better understand drivers of Leach’s storm-petrel populations trends in Atlantic Canada."
https://openalex.org/W2801827592,"Targeting of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) PE/PPE antigens that induce type 1 helper T cell (Th1) and Th17 responses represents a crucial strategy for the development of tuberculosis (TB) vaccines. However, only a few PE/PPE antigens induce these responses. Here, we sought to determine how the cell wall–associated antigen PPE60 (Rv3478) activates dendritic cell (DC) maturation and T-cell differentiation. We observed that PPE60 induces DC maturation by augmenting the protein expression of cluster of differentiation 80 (CD80) and CD86 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and MHC class II on the cell surface. PPE60 also stimulated the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-12p70, and IL-23p19 but not IL-10. This induction was mediated by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and followed by activation of p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and NF-κB signaling. PPE60 enhanced MHC-II expression and promoted antigen processing by DCs in a TLR2-dependent manner. Moreover, PPE60-stimulated DCs directed naïve CD4+ T cells to produce IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-17A, expanding the Th1 and Th17 responses, along with activation of T-bet and RAR-related orphan receptor C (RORγt) but not GATA-3. Moreover, PPE60 activated the NLRP3 inflammasome followed by caspase-1–dependent IL-1β and IL-18 synthesis in DCs. Of note, pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 activation specifically attenuated IFN-γ and IL-17A secretion into the supernatant from CD4+ T cells cocultured with PPE60-activated DCs. These findings indicate that PPE60 induces Th1 and Th17 immune responses by activating DCs in a TLR2-dependent manner, suggesting PPE60's potential for use in MTB vaccine development.

Indeed, greater than one-third of the world's population is latently infected with this organism, and millions of people succumb to MTB infection each year (2O'Garra A. Redford P.S. McNab F.W.

Due to the current epidemic fueled by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection and increasing spread of drug-resistant MTB strains, the resurgence of pulmonary tuberculosis is an ongoing threat to global health (3Sayes F.

The PE/PPE family proteins from MTB are named after the presence of their conserved N-terminal Pro-Glu (PE) or Pro-Pro-Glu (PPE) motifs (6Brennan M.J. The enigmatic PE/PPE multigene family of mycobacteria and tuberculosis vaccination.Infect. Immun. 2017; 85 (28348055): e00969-1610.1128/IAI.00969-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 99 pe and 69 ppe genes represent ∼10% of the genome and are characterized by their high GC content and extensive repetitive homologous sequences (7Fishbein S. van Wyk N. Warren R.M. Sampson S.L. Phylogeny to function: PE/PPE protein evolution and impact on Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenicity.Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 96 (25727695): 901-91610.1111/mmi.12981Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although the detailed function of this gene family remains to be unraveled, PE/PPE genes are strongly suspected to be associated with several aspects of host–pathogen interactions, such as bacterial virulence, mycobacterial growth, and antigenic variation (8Vordermeier H.M. Hewinson R.G. Wilkinson R.J. Wilkinson K.A. Gideon H.P. Young D.B. Sampson S.L. Conserved immune recognition hierarchy of mycobacterial PE/PPE proteins during infection in natural hosts.PLoS One. 2012; 7 (22870206)e4089010.1371/journal.pone.0040890Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For example, two PPE proteins (PPE31/PPE68) and one PE (PE35) were found to be required for mycobacterial growth in vivo during infection of mice (9Camacho L.R. Ensergueix D. Perez E. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Identification of a virulence gene cluster of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by signature-tagged transposon mutagenesis.Mol.

A PPE protein from Mycobacterium avium (PPE25 ortholog) has been shown to be involved in virulence by hampering vacuole acidification and phagosome-lysosome fusion in macrophages (11Li Y. Miltner E. Wu M. Petrofsky M. Bermudez L.E. A Mycobacterium avium PPE gene is associated with the ability of the bacterium to grow in macrophages and virulence in mice.Cell.

In particular, a series of PE/PPE proteins (such as PPE18, PPE41, and PE_PGRS33) have been linked to the rich source of B- and T-cell epitopes and the presence of antigenic diversity, either in the form of whole recombinant proteins or as individual peptides (12Mukhopadhyay S. Balaji K.N. The PE and PPE proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Tuberculosis. 2011; 91 (21527209): 441-44710.1016/j.tube.2011.04.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Sampson S.L.

Genet. 2010; 42 (20495566): 498-50310.1038/ng.590Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Many PE/PPE antigens are exported or secreted via the type VII secretion systems that are actively involved in pathogenesis and antigenic variability (15Brennan M.J. Delogu G. The PE multigene family: a ‘molecular mantra’ for mycobacteria.Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10 (11973159): 246-24910.1016/S0966-842X(02)02335-1Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In this context, the cell surface–associated or extracellular localization of PE/PPE proteins is likely linked to their remarkable immunogenicity (12Mukhopadhyay S. Balaji K.N. The PE and PPE proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Tuberculosis. 2011; 91 (21527209): 441-44710.1016/j.tube.2011.04.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Additionally, the duplication, homologous recombination, or random insertion of the pe/ppe genes throughout the MTB genome may lead to substantial degrees of variability in the expression profiles during different phases of infection, possibly hinting at their diverse functions (16Voskuil M.I. Schnappinger D. Rutherford R. Liu Y. Schoolnik G.K. Regulation of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis PE/PPE genes.Tuberculosis. 2004; 84 (15207495): 256-26210.1016/j.tube.2003.12.014Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Moreover, the highly immunogenic nature of PE/PPE immunogens is essentially driven by a substantial degree of direct or cross-reactivities in the elicited T cells, which results from the sequence homologies among the PE/PPE family proteins (7Fishbein S. van Wyk N. Warren R.M. Sampson S.L. Phylogeny to function: PE/PPE protein evolution and impact on Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenicity.Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 96 (25727695): 901-91610.1111/mmi.12981Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, this also begs the question of whether the conserved immunogenicity of the PE/PPEs antigens benefits the pathogen. As reported by others, PE/PPE proteins also may contribute to immune evasion by overwhelming the adaptive immune response or inducing robust anti-inflammatory responses (13Sampson S.L. Mycobacterial PE/PPE proteins at the host-pathogen interface.Clin. Dev. Immunol. 2011; 2011 (21318182)49720310.1155/2011/497203Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 17Akhter Y. Ehebauer M.T.

The establishment of a protective response against mycobacterial infections involves different Th1-related cytokines (18Sato K. Akaki T. Tomioka H.

Distinct chemokine and cytokine gene expression pattern of murine dendritic cells and macrophages in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2008; 84 (18703681): 1264-127010.1189/jlb.1107742Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The PE/PPE proteins have been assumed to modulate the immune-effector functions of antigen-presenting cells (6Brennan M.J. The enigmatic PE/PPE multigene family of mycobacteria and tuberculosis vaccination.Infect. Immun. 2017; 85 (28348055): e00969-1610.1128/IAI.00969-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); however, there are few reports deciphering the detailed mechanisms of interaction of PPE antigens with DCs. Thus, functional characterization of the effects of PE/PPE proteins on DC activation will provide insights into mycobacterial immunity. PPE60 was previously identified in the cell-envelope fraction by MS and exhibited strong humoral reactivity with PPD+ but not PPD− individuals (22de Souza G.A. Leversen N.A. Målen H. Wiker H.G. Bacterial proteins with cleaved or uncleaved signal peptides of the general secretory pathway.J.

The expression of this protein was observed in MTB H37Rv-infected guinea pig lungs at 90 days (24Kruh N.A. Troudt J. Izzo A. Prenni J. Dobos K.M. Portrait of a pathogen: The Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteome in vivo.PLoS One. 2010; 5 (21085642)e1393810.1371/journal.pone.0013938Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), indicating that PPE60 protein could be necessary for long-term persistence of MTB during infection. Recently, PPE60 antigen has been shown to consistently and significantly induce the expansion of effector CD4+ T-cells subsets, resulting in secretion of interferon (IFN)-γ and reduction of bacterial burdens in mice (25Derrick S.C. Yabe I.M. Yang A. Kolibab K. Hollingsworth B. Kurtz S.L. Morris S. Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of novel Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens.Vaccine. 2013; 31 (23906890): 4641-464610.1016/j.vaccine.2013.07.032Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Additionally, as a component of TB fusion protein vaccine ID87, this antigen induced antituberculosis protective responses (26Windish H.P. Duthie M.S. Misquith A. Ireton G. Lucas E. Laurance J.D. Bailor R.H. Coler R.N. Reed S.G. Protection of mice from Mycobacterium tuberculosis by ID87/GLA-SE, a novel tuberculosis subunit vaccine candidate.Vaccine. 2011; 29 (21816196): 7842-784810.1016/j.vaccine.2011.07.094Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The surface localization of PE/PPE proteins might enable the bacteria to interact with the molecules of host innate immune pathways (17Akhter Y. Ehebauer M.T. Mukhopadhyay S. Hasnain S.E. The PE/PPE multigene family codes for virulence factors and is a possible source of mycobacterial antigenic variation: perhaps more?.Biochimie. 2012; 94 (22005451): 110-11610.1016/j.biochi.2011.09.026Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 27Sayes F.

Here, we determined the effects of PPE60 on DC maturation and the mechanism of regulation of host immunity in turn, offering detailed insights into the immune mechanisms underlying the specific potential of PE/PPE proteins as protective immunogens. To investigate the role and localization of the PPE60 protein, the PPE60 gene from MTB H37Rv was cloned into the expression vector pRSFDuet-1, and the vector was transformed into Escherichia coli to express the target protein with a His6 tag as described under “Materials and methods.” The cell lysate and the purified recombinant protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-PPE60 antibody (Ab). As shown in Fig. 1A, the Coomassie Blue staining showed the expression of the target protein at the expected molecular mass (∼39 kDa), which was confirmed by Western blot analysis with anti-PPE60 Ab (Fig. 1B). In addition, a recombinant BCG strain expressing the PPE60 protein was developed as described under “Materials and methods.” As expected, expression of the PPE60 protein was detected in the cell lysate of the recombinant BCG strain by immunoblotting with anti-PPE60 Ab, whereas it was not detected in the lysates of the wildtype (WT) BCG or rBCG-pMV261 (Fig. 1C). Next, cell fractionation experiments were performed in MTB H37Rv and the recombinant BCG-PPE60 strain. PPE57 is known to be exposed on the cell surface and therefore was used as a positive control (28Xu Y. Yang E. Huang Q. Ni W. Kong C. Liu G. Li G. Su H. Wang H. PPE57 induces activation of macrophages and drives Th1-type immune responses through TLR2.J. Mol. Med. 2015; 93 (25586105): 645-66210.1007/s00109-014-1243-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The PPE60 protein was detected in the cell wall fraction by immunoblot analysis, whereas Rv2145c (a cytoplasmic protein) was only present in the cytoplasm, indicating that, similarly to PPE57, PPE60 is associated with the cell wall (Fig. 1D). To further query the cell-surface localization of PPE60, proteinase K and trypsin degradation assays were carried out on whole recombinant BCG-PPE60 cells followed by Western blot analysis. As expected, PPE60 was degraded by proteinase K and trypsin in just 20 min, whereas the cytoplasmic Rv2145c was not digested at all (Fig. 1E). Together, these results demonstrate that PPE60 is likely to be exposed on the cell surface. DC maturation plays a crucial role in priming adaptive immune responses, and it is critically dependent on the cognate interaction between costimulatory molecules on DCs and the associated ligands on T cells (21Jang S. Uzelac A. Salgame P. Distinct chemokine and cytokine gene expression pattern of murine dendritic cells and macrophages in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2008; 84 (18703681): 1264-127010.1189/jlb.1107742Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether PPE60 induced DC maturation by measuring the expression levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) classes I and II and costimulatory molecules, including CD80 and CD86, in the presence of 1, 5, or 10 μg/ml PPE60 or 5 μg/ml Pam3CSK4. Analysis of flow cytometry showed that PPE60 stimulation enhanced the expression of costimulatory molecules on DCs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Mature DCs secrete a variety of cytokines that influence T-cell polarization. In this regard, we determined whether PPE60 induced the production of inflammatory and regulatory cytokines by priming an innate immune response in DCs. As shown in Fig. 2B, the levels of TNFα, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β were significantly higher in PPE60-stimulated DCs compared with untreated DCs, which only produced a small amount of these cytokines. Additionally, the levels of IL-12 p70 and IL-23 p19 increased significantly in PPE60-stimulated DCs in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the levels of IL-10 were not altered (Fig. 2C). We also investigated the intracellular production of IL-12 p70 and IL-10. Compared with untreated DCs, a higher percentage of PPE60-treated DCs were IL-12 p70–positive, whereas negligible change was observed in the number of IL-10–positive cells (Fig. 2D). IL-12 p70 and IL-23 p19 are associated with the development of Th1 and Th17 responses (29Thakker P. Leach M.W. Kuang W. Benoit S.E. Leonard J.P. Marusic S. IL-23 is critical in the induction but not in the effector phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.J. Immunol. 2007; 178 (17277169): 2589-259810.4049/jimmunol.178.4.2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In contrast, PPE60 could not induce IFN-β production (Fig. S1), which is also essential for DC maturation and T cell priming. Therefore, these results strongly suggest that PPE60 is a potent effector of DC maturation, inducing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines that could eventually prime Th1 and Th17 immune responses. TLRs recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns from mycobacterial cell components and activate cellular immune responses. Many other PPE proteins (such as PPE18, PPE26, and PPE57) have been shown to bind to TLR2 (28Xu Y. Yang E. Huang Q. Ni W. Kong C. Liu G. Li G. Su H. Wang H. PPE57 induces activation of macrophages and drives Th1-type immune responses through TLR2.J. Mol. Med. 2015; 93 (25586105): 645-66210.1007/s00109-014-1243-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30Su H. Kong C. Zhu L. Huang Q. Luo L. Wang H. Xu Y. PPE26 induces TLR2-dependent activation of macrophages and drives Th1-type T-cell immunity by triggering the cross-talk of multiple pathways involved in the host response.Oncotarget. 2015; 6 (26439698): 38517-3853710.18632/oncotarget.5956Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 31Nair S. Ramaswamy P.A. Ghosh S. Joshi D.C. Pathak N. Siddiqui I. Sharma P. Hasnain S.E. Mande S.C. Mukhopadhyay S.

Immunol. 2009; 183 (19880448): 6269-628110.4049/jimmunol.0901367Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, to determine whether PPE60 acted through TLR2 recognition, DCs were incubated with anti-TLR2, anti-TLR4, or IgG isotype control Ab followed by treatment with increasing concentrations of PPE60 for 24 h, and IL-1β production in supernatants was measured by ELISA. PPE60 induced the secretion of IL-1β in DCs treated with anti-TLR4 and anti-IgG but not in cells treated with anti-TLR2 Ab (Fig. 3A). Flow cytometry analysis also showed that PPE60 bound to the surface of WT DCs but not to the surface of TLR2−/− cells (Fig. 3B). Confocal imaging analysis further confirmed this observation (Fig. 3C). Moreover, western blots showed that immobilized PPE60 could pulldown TLR2 (Fig. 3D), whereas no band was visible in the control group or the group containing TLR4 (Fig. 3D). These findings suggested that PPE60 interacts specifically and predominantly with TLR2. To ascertain if PPE60 induced DCs activation via TLR2, we examined the expression of cell-surface molecules and the production of cytokines in PPE60-stimulated DCs from WT, TLR2−/−, and TLR4−/− mice. Both, cell-surface molecule expression (Fig. 3E) and inflammatory cytokine production (Fig. 3F) were promoted in PPE60-treated WT and TLR4−/− DCs, whereas these effects were significantly abrogated in TLR2−/− DCs. Taken together, these results clearly indicate that PPE60 is a potent TLR2 agonist and induces DC maturation. Activation of TLR2 signaling induces the recruitment of MyD88 and the subsequent activation of the MAPKs and NF-κB signaling pathways, which are critical for DC maturation (32Ade N. Antonios D. Kerdine-Romer S. Boisleve F. Rousset F. Pallardy M. NF-κB plays a major role in the maturation of human dendritic cells induced by NiSO4 but not by DNCB.Toxicol. Sci. 2007; 99 (17636246): 488-50110.1093/toxsci/kfm178Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed whether PPE60 induced DC activation via the MAPK and NF-κB pathways. To this end, DCs were incubated with culture medium, 10 μg/ml PPE60, 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or 5 μg/ml Pam3CSK4, and the phosphorylation status of MAPKs and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 were evaluated by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, PPE60 triggered a strong phosphorylation of p38 and JNK in DCs. Similar results were observed by confocal microscopy analysis of cells stained with Abs specific to p-p38 and p-JNK (Fig. 4B). Additionally, PPE60 induced a robust nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 (Fig. 4A). To determine the functional roles of MAPKs and NF-κB signaling in DC activation induced by PPE60, pharmacological inhibitors were used, and inflammatory cytokine secretion and costimulatory molecular expression were evaluated following PPE60 stimulation. Specifically, DCs were pretreated with a p38 inhibitor (SB203580; 30 μm), a JNK inhibitor (SP600125; 50 μm), or an NF-κB inhibitor (Bay11-7082) for 1 h prior to stimulation with PPE60 (10 μg/ml). Predictably, these inhibitors significantly abrogated the PPE60-induced expression of the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 and MHC-I (Fig. 4C) and the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-6, and IL-12 p70 (Fig. 4D). These findings suggest that the MAPKs and NF-κB pathways are essential for PPE60-induced DC maturation. We subsequently studied whether PPE60 affects MHC-II expression. To this end, DCs were treated with only medium, PPE60, or IFN-γ, and MHC-II expression was examined using flow cytometry. After 48-h treatment, a 2.92-fold increase in MHC-II expression was observed in DCs treated with IFN-γ, whereas the expression levels remained low in DCs incubated with only medium. Similarly, a 2.36-fold increase in MHC-II expression was observed in DCs treated with PPE60 compared with treatment with only medium. Coincubation with both PPE60 and IFN-γ increased the expression of MHC-II 3.7-fold (Fig. 5A). Next, we investigated the role of TLR2 in MHC-II expression induced by PPE60. DCs from C57BL/6 or TLR2−/− mice were treated with or without PPE60 for 24–48 h, and MHC-II expression was examined by flow cytometry. PPE60 promoted MHC-II expression in DCs from both types of mice; however, MHC-II expression was lower in TLR2−/− mice than in C57BL/6 mice after 48-h incubation (Fig. 5B), indicating that PPE60 may enhance MHC-II expression in a TLR2-dependent manner. Finally, we examined whether PPE60 also affects the Ag-processing ability of DCs. To this end, DCs from WT or TLR2−/− mice were treated with or without PPE60 for 24 h in the presence of IFN-γ followed by exposure to OVA(323–339) for 3 h and coculturing with DOBW T hybridoma cells for 24 h at a ratio of 1:10. IL-2 production was measured by the CTLL-2 assay as described as described under “Materials and methods.” As shown in Fig. 5C, exposure of DCs to PPE60 enhanced IL-2 production with a substantial increase observed in the presence of 500 ng/ml OVA(323–339) and the maximum obtained with 1000 ng/ml OVA(323–339) (Fig. 5D). However, the increased production of IL-2 was attenuated in TLR2−/− DCs compared with that in WT and TLR4−/− cells (Fig. 5D). These results demonstrate that exposure of DCs to PPE60 increases IL-2 production from T cells, indicating that PPE60 promotes MHC-II processing of OVA(323–339) in a TLR2-dependent manner. To further validate this conclusion, DCs pretreated with IgG isotype control, anti-TLR2, or anti-TLR4 Ab for 18 h were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml PPE60 and then cocultured with splenic CD4+ T cells from mice immunize"
https://openalex.org/W2802773414,"Both a lack of biomarkers and relatively ineffective treatments constitute impediments to management of lupus nephritis (LN). Here we used gene expression microarrays to contrast the transcriptomic profiles of active SLE patients with and without LN to identify potential biomarkers for this condition. RNA isolated from whole peripheral blood of active SLE patients was used for transcriptomic profiling and the data analyzed by linear modeling, with corrections for multiple testing. Results were validated in a second cohort of SLE patients, using NanoString technology. The majority of genes demonstrating altered transcript abundance between patients with and without LN were neutrophil-related. Findings in the validation cohort confirmed this observation and showed that levels of RNA abundance in renal remission were similar to active patients without LN. In secondary analyses, RNA abundance correlated with disease activity, hematuria and proteinuria, but not renal biopsy changes. As abundance levels of the individual transcripts correlated strongly with each other, a composite neutrophil score was generated by summing all levels before examining additional correlations. There was a modest correlation between the neutrophil score and the blood neutrophil count, which was largely driven by the dose of glucocorticosteroids and not the proportion of low density and/or activated neutrophils. Analysis of longitudinal data revealed no correlation between baseline neutrophil score or changes over the first year of follow-up with subsequent renal flare or treatment outcomes, respectively. The findings argue that although the neutrophil score is associated with LN, its clinical utility as a biomarker may be limited."

Secondary bile acids were shown to confer resistance to colonization by C. difficile. 7α-dehydroxylation is a key step in transformation of primary to secondary bile acids and required genes have been located in a single bile acid-inducible (bai) operon in C. scindens as well as in C. hiranonis, two Clostridium sp. recently reported to protect against C. difficile colonization. Aim To analyze baiCD gene abundance in C. difficile positive and negative fecal samples. Material & methods A species-specific qPCR for detecting baiCD genes was established. Fecal samples of patients with CDI, asymptomatic toxigenic C. difficile colonization (TCD), non-toxigenic C. difficile colonization (NTCD), of C. difficile negative (NC) patients, and of two patients before and after fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for recurrent CDI (rCDI) were tested for the presence of the baiCD genes. Results The prevalence of the baiCD gene cluster was significantly higher in C. difficile negative fecal samples than in samples of patients diagnosed with CDI (72.5% (100/138) vs. 35.9% (23/64; p<0.0001). No differences in baiCD gene cluster prevalence were seen between NC and NTCD or NC and TCD samples. Both rCDI patients were baiCD-negative at baseline, but one of the two patients turned positive after successful FMT from a baiCD-positive donor. Conclusion Fecal samples of CDI patients are less frequently baiCD-positive than samples from asymptomatic carriers or C. difficile-negative individuals. Furthermore, we present a case of baiCD positivity observed after successful FMT for rCDI."
https://openalex.org/W2800812237,"Repositioning of the maxilla in orthognathic surgery is carried out for functional and aesthetic purposes. Pre-surgical planning tools can predict 3D facial appearance by computing the response of the soft tissue to the changes to the underlying skeleton. The clinical use of commercial prediction software remains controversial, likely due to the deterministic nature of these computational predictions. A novel probabilistic finite element model (FEM) for the prediction of postoperative facial soft tissues is proposed in this paper. A probabilistic FEM was developed and validated on a cohort of eight patients who underwent maxillary repositioning and had pre- and postoperative cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans taken. Firstly, a variables correlation assessed various modelling parameters. Secondly, a design of experiments (DOE) provided a range of potential outcomes based on uniformly distributed input parameters, followed by an optimisation. Lastly, the second DOE iteration provided optimised predictions with a probability range. A range of 3D predictions was obtained using the probabilistic FEM and validated using reconstructed soft tissue surfaces from the postoperative CBCT data. The predictions in the nose and upper lip areas accurately include the true postoperative position, whereas the prediction under-estimates the position of the cheeks and lower lip. A probabilistic FEM has been developed and validated for the prediction of the facial appearance following orthognathic surgery. This method shows how inaccuracies in the modelling and uncertainties in executing surgical planning influence the soft tissue prediction and it provides a range of predictions including a minimum and maximum, which may be helpful for patients in understanding the impact of surgery on the face."
https://openalex.org/W2802188199,"Dairy farming is one the most important sectors of United Kingdom (UK) agriculture. It faces major challenges due to climate change, which will have direct impacts on dairy cows as a result of heat stress. In the absence of adaptations, this could potentially lead to considerable milk loss. Using an 11-member climate projection ensemble, as well as an ensemble of 18 milk loss estimation methods, temporal changes in milk production of UK dairy cows were estimated for the 21st century at a 25 km resolution in a spatially-explicit way. While increases in UK temperatures are projected to lead to relatively low average annual milk losses, even for southern UK regions (<180 kg/cow), the ‘hottest’ 25×25 km grid cell in the hottest year in the 2090s, showed an annual milk loss exceeding 1300 kg/cow. This figure represents approximately 17% of the potential milk production of today’s average cow. Despite the potential considerable inter-annual variability of annual milk loss, as well as the large differences between the climate projections, the variety of calculation methods is likely to introduce even greater uncertainty into milk loss estimations. To address this issue, a novel, more biologically-appropriate mechanism of estimating milk loss is proposed that provides more realistic future projections. We conclude that South West England is the region most vulnerable to climate change economically, because it is characterised by a high dairy herd density and therefore potentially high heat stress-related milk loss. In the absence of mitigation measures, estimated heat stress-related annual income loss for this region by the end of this century may reach £13.4M in average years and £33.8M in extreme years."
https://openalex.org/W2800497726,"A large body of evidence suggests that persistent dietary fat overload causes mitochondrial dysfunction and systemic metabolic gridlock. Mitochondrial and lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle (SkM) are severely affected upon persistent high fat diet (HFD) leading to premature tissue aging. Here, we designed weekly cycles of fasting (called as time-controlled fasting, TCF) and showed that they were effective in limiting mitochondrial damage and metabolic disturbances induced by HFD. Specifically, TCF was able to prevent the decline of adipose triglyceride lipase (Atgl), maintain efficient mitochondrial respiration in SkM as well as improve blood glucose and lipid profile. Atgl was found to be the mediator of such preventive effects as its downregulation or up-regulation in C2C12 myotubes triggers mitochondrial alteration or protects against the deleterious effects of high fat levels respectively. In conclusion, TCF could represent an effective strategy to limit mitochondrial impairment and metabolic inflexibility that are typically induced by modern western diets or during aging."
https://openalex.org/W2802582436,"Determining what factors affect species occurrence is vital to the study of primate biogeography. We investigated the metapopulation dynamics of a lemur community consisting of eight species (Avahi occidentalis, Propithecus coquereli, Microcebus murinus, Microcebus ravelobensis, Lepilemur edwardsi, Cheirogaleus medius, Eulemur mongoz, and Eulemur fulvus) within fragmented tropical dry deciduous forest habitat in Ankarafantsika National Park, Madagascar. We measured fragment size and isolation of 42 fragments of forest ranging in size from 0.23 to 117.7 ha adjacent to continuous forest. Between June and November 2011, we conducted 1218 surveys and observed six of eight lemur species (M. murinus, M. ravelobensis, C. medius, E. fulvus, P. coquereli, and L. edwardsi) in the 42 fragments. We applied among patch incidence function models (IFMs) with various measures of dispersal and a mainland-island IFM to lemur species occurrence, with the aim of answering the following questions: 1) Do lemur species in dry deciduous forest fragments form metapopulations? 2) What are the separate effects of area (extinction risk) and connectivity/isolation (colonization potential) within a lemur metapopulation? 3) Within simulated metapopulations over time, how do area and connectivity/isolation affect occurrence? and 4) What are the conservation implications of our findings? We found that M. murinus formed either a mainland-island or an among patch metapopulation, M. ravelobensis formed a mainland-island metapopulation, C. medius and E. fulvus formed among patch metapopulations, and neither P. coquereli or L. edwardsi formed a metapopulation. Metapopulation dynamics and simulations suggest that area was a more consistent positive factor determining lemur species occurrence than fragment isolation and is crucial to the maintenance of lemur populations within this fragmented landscape. Using a metapopulation approach to lemur biogeography is critical for understanding how lemur species respond to forest loss and fragmentation."

Forged user-generated content data, such as user ratings and reviews, are used by attackers to manipulate recommendation rankings. Shilling attack detection in recommender systems is of great significance to maintain the fairness and sustainability of recommender systems. The current studies have problems in terms of the poor universality of algorithms, difficulty in selection of user profile attributes, and lack of an optimization mechanism. In this paper, a shilling behaviour detection structure based on abnormal group user findings and rating time series analysis is proposed. This paper adds to the current understanding in the field by studying the credibility evaluation model in-depth based on the rating prediction model to derive proximity-based predictions. A method for detecting suspicious ratings based on suspicious time windows and target item analysis is proposed. Suspicious rating time segments are determined by constructing a time series, and data streams of the rating items are examined and suspicious rating segments are checked. To analyse features of shilling attacks by a group user's credibility, an abnormal group user discovery method based on time series and time window is proposed. Standard testing datasets are used to verify the effect of the proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W2801838524,"Huntington's disease (HD) is one of the most devastating genetic neurodegenerative disorders with no effective medical therapy. β-Lapachone (βL) is a natural compound obtained from the bark of the Lapacho tree and has been reported to have beneficial effects on various diseases. Sirt1 is a deacetylase of the sirtuin family and deacetylates proteins including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α) which is associated with mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis. To examine the effectiveness of βL on HD, βL was orally applied to R6/2 HD mice and behavioral phenotypes associated with HD, such as impairment of rota-rod performance and increase of clasping behavior, as well as changes of Sirt1 expression, CREB phosphorylation and PGC-1α deacetylation were examined. Western blot results showed that Sirt1 and p-CREB levels were significantly increased in the brains of βL-treated R6/2 mice. An increase in deacetylation of PGC-1α, which is thought to increase its activity, was observed by oral administration of βL. In an in vitro HD model, βL treatment resulted in an attenuation of MitoSOX red fluorescence intensity, indicating an amelioration of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species by βL. Furthermore, improvements in the rota-rod performance and clasping score were observed in R6/2 HD mice after oral administration of βL compared to that of vehicle control-treated mice. Taken together, our data show that βL is a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of HD-associated phenotypes, and increases in Sirt1 level, CREB phosphorylation and PGC-103B1 deacetylation can be the possible underlying mechanism of the effects of βL."
https://openalex.org/W2802355652,"Marine invertebrates, as holobionts, contain symbiotic bacteria that coevolve and develop antimicrobial substances. These symbiotic bacteria are an underexplored source of new bioactive molecules to face the emerging antibiotic resistance in pathogens. Here, we explored the antimicrobial activity of bacteria retrieved from the microbiota of two sea anemones (Anemonia sulcata, Actinia equina) and two holothurians (Holothuria tubulosa, Holothuria forskali). We tested the antimicrobial activity of the isolated bacteria against pathogens with interest for human health, agriculture and aquaculture. We isolated 27 strains with antibacterial activity and 12 of these isolates also showed antifungal activity. We taxonomically identified these strains being Bacillus and Vibrio species the most representative producers of antimicrobial substances. Microbiome species composition of the two sea anemones was similar between them but differed substantially of seawater bacteria. In contrast, microbiome species composition of the two holothurian species was different between them and in comparison with the bacteria in holothurian feces and seawater. In all the holobiont microbiomes Bacteroidetes was the predominant phylum. For each microbiome, we determined diversity and the rank-abundance dominance using five fitted models (null, pre-emption, log-Normal, Zipf and Zipf-Mandelbrot). The models with less evenness (i.e. Zipf and Zipf-Mandelblot) showed the best fits in all the microbiomes. Finally, we tracked (using the V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene) the relative abundance of these 27 isolates with antibacterial activity in the total pool of sequences obtained for the microbiome of each holobiont. Coincidences, although with extremely low frequencies, were detected only in the microbiome of H. forskali. This fact suggests that these isolated bacteria belong to the long tail of rare symbiotic bacteria. Therefore, more and more sophisticated culture techniques are necessary to explore this apparently vast pool of rare symbiontic bacteria and to determine their biotechnological potentiality."

The sampling frame was designated as distinct geographic regions throughout the country. A stratified two-stage cluster sampling was used to select the study population. Anthropometry and 12-hour fasting blood samples were obtained by trained personnel. BMI of ≥25 kg/m2 was classified as obesity. MetS was defined as having elevated waist circumference (>90 and >80 cm in men and women, respectively) plus any two of the followings: triglyceride ≥150 mg/dL, HDL-C <40 in men or <50 mg/dL in women, blood pressure ≥130/85 mmHg, and fasting blood sugar ≥100 mg/dL. CKD was defined as an impaired renal function (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 according to the CKD-EPI equation). Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between obesity and MetS with the presence of CKD. Results A total of 32,616 diabetic patients were finally recruited from 997 hospitals. The mean age was 61.5±10.9 years with 67.5% women. Of the participants, 35.4% were CKD patients. The prevalence of obesity was 46.5% in CKD and 54.1% in non-CKD patients with T2DM (p<0.001). In contrast, the prevalence of MetS in CKD patients was higher than their non-CKD counterparts (71.3 vs 68.8%, p<0.001). Moreover, there was an association between the prevalence of MetS with CKD stage from 3a to 5 (70.1, 72.3, 73.4, and 72.7%, respectively, p trend = 0.02). MetS, but not obesity, had a significant association with CKD in T2DM patients after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities [OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.06–1.22, p<0.001]. When stratified by each component of MetS, only high serum triglyceride and low HDL-C levels were increased in patients with CKD stage 4 and 5 compared with CKD stage 3 (p<0.001) and had a significant relationship with impaired renal function. Conclusion There were relatively high prevalences of both obesity and MetS in T2DM patients. A higher prevalence of MetS, but lower prevalence of obesity, was observed among diabetic CKD group compared with their non-CKD counterparts. MetS, as a surrogate of insulin resistance, appeared to be more important than obesity in the development of impaired renal function in diabetic population."

Here, we report on NMR experiments on liquid and biological entities immersed in liquids having volumes down to 100 pL. These measurements are enabled by the fabrication of high spatial resolution 3D printed microfluidic structures, specifically conceived to guide and confine sub-nL samples in the sub-nL most sensitive volume of a single-chip integrated NMR probe. The microfluidic structures are fabricated using two-photon polymerization 3D printing. This technique has a resolution better than 1 ${\mu}$m$^3$ and allows to rapidly fabricate complex microfluidic structures tailored to position, hold, and feed biological samples, with a design that maximizes the NMR signals amplitude and minimizes the static magnetic field inhomogeneities. The NMR probe consists of an electronic transceiver and a 150 ${\mu}$m diameter excitation/detection microcoil, co-integrated on a single silicon chip of about 1 mm$^2$. To demonstrate the potential of this approach, we report NMR experiments on sub-nL intact biological entities in liquid media, specifically ova of the tardigrade Richtersius coronifer and sections of Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. We show a sensitivity of 2.5x10$^{13}$ spins/Hz$^{1/2}$ on 1H nuclei at 7 T, sufficient to detect highly concentrated endogenous compounds in active volumes down to 100 pL in a measurement time of 3 hours. Spectral resolutions of 0.01 ppm in liquids and of 0.1 ppm in the investigated biological entities are demonstrated. The obtained results indicate a promising route for NMR studies at the single unit level of important sub-nL biological entities, such as living microscopic organisms and eggs of several mammalians, humans included."

Pharmacological modulation of PDC activity could provide a new treatment for diabetic cardiomyopathy, as dysregulated substrate selection is concomitant with decreased heart function. Dichloroacetate (DCA), a classic PDK inhibitor, has been used to treat diabetic cardiomyopathy, but the lack of specificity and side effects of DCA indicate a more specific inhibitor of PDK is needed. This study was designed to determine the effects of a novel and highly selective PDK inhibitor, 2((2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)sulfonyl) isoindoline-4,6-diol (designated PS10), on pyruvate oxidation in diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse hearts compared with DCA-treated hearts. Four groups of mice were studied: lean control, DIO, DIO + DCA, and DIO + PS10. Both DCA and PS10 improved glucose tolerance in the intact animal. Pyruvate metabolism was studied in perfused hearts supplied with physiological mixtures of long chain fatty acids, lactate, and pyruvate. Analysis was performed using conventional 1H and 13C isotopomer methods in combination with hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate in the same hearts. PS10 and DCA both stimulated flux through PDC as measured by the appearance of hyperpolarized [13C]bicarbonate. DCA but not PS10 increased hyperpolarized [1-13C]lactate production.

It is generally accepted that carbohydrate oxidation is inhibited in the insulin-resistant heart, and is concomitant with the development of outright diabetic cardiomyopathy (2Fukushima A. Lopaschuk G.D. Cardiac fatty acid oxidation in heart failure associated with obesity and diabetes.Biochim. Biophys.

The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) connects glycolysis to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for the production of NADH and FADH2, and subsequent oxidative phosphorylation, and plays a pivotal role in modulating substrate selection for the production of acetyl-CoA. Increased fatty acid availability and oxidation associated with T2D suppresses the activity of the PDC (2Fukushima A. Lopaschuk G.D.

The PDC is negatively regulated by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoforms 1 to 4 (PDK1–4) via phosphorylation of the E1α subunit (5Harris R.A. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Huang B. Wu P.

Because of its strategic location, the regulation of PDC activity is critical for whole body glucose homeostasis, but PDC activity is down-regulated in diabetic cardiomyopathy (6Kuo T.H.

Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in cardiac mitochondria from genetically diabetic mice.Diabetes. 1985; 34 (4043556): 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another pathogenic mechanism of diabetic cardiomyopathy derives from elevated peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor alpha (PPARα) expression in obesity and T2D, leading to the overexpression of PDK4 and decreased PDC activity (7Wu P.

Although it has been suggested that fuel overload may be causative in heart failure (HF) associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy (9Taegtmeyer H. Beauloye C. Harmancey R. Hue L. Insulin resistance protects the heart from fuel overload in dysregulated metabolic states.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

For all these reasons, PDC activation remains a key therapeutic target for diabetic cardiomyopathy. PDC dysfunction is also a hallmark of other cardiovascular pathophysiologies including ischemia (11Lopaschuk G.D. Stanley W.C.

This technology has recently been used to image PDC activity in the human heart (25Cunningham C.H. Lau J.Y.C. Chen A.P. Geraghty B.J. Perks W.J. Roifman I. Wright G.A. Connelly K.A. Hyperpolarized 13C metabolic MRI of the human heart: Initial experience.Circ. Res. 2016; 119 (27635086): 1177-118210.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309769Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The experiments here prove that PS10 up-regulates PDC flux without generating excess lactate production, as is the case with DCA. This suggests PS10 has significant potential as a therapeutic agent for PDC activation. To compare the metabolic effects of each PDK inhibitor, we first assayed the optimal dose of each agent for restoration of glucose tolerance in DIO mice after 2 weeks of treatment. This dose was postulated to be optimal for metabolic comparison. After testing DCA at 100 (Fig. S1A), 200 (Fig. S1B), and 250 mg/kg/day, the 250-mg dose was chosen for maximal restoration of glucose homeostasis. Similar experiments led to a choice of 70 mg/kg/day for PS10. DIO mice fed with 60% high-fat diet for 18 weeks were administered either PS10 at 70 mg/kg/day or DCA at 250 mg/kg/day by intraperitoneal injection. These doses conferred the maximal restoration of glucose homeostasis. A DMSO injection was used as a control. A glucose tolerance test was carried out on control versus DIO animals. After 6.5 h of fasting, 1.5 g/kg of glucose was administered intraperitoneally. Plasma glucose levels were measured as indicated (Fig. 1). At these doses, both the PS10 and DCA groups show similar glucose tolerance response to glucose challenge (Fig. 1A). Compared with the control group, both PS10 and DCA treatments significantly improved glucose tolerance in DIO mice. We also compared effects of single-dose PDK inhibitors on the PDC activity in heart at the doses mentioned above. Treatment with both PDK inhibitors resulted in significant enhancements of PDC activity in DIO mouse hearts compared with DIO controls (Fig. 1B). The elevated PDC activity by both PDK inhibitors corresponded to a decrease of phosphorylation on the PDC E1α subunit in DIO mouse hearts (Fig. 1C). The activity of the PDC complex in functioning tissue was assayed directly using HP [1-13C]pyruvate. The experimental groups included a control set of DIO mice and additional sets of mice treated with either PS10 or DCA. A single dose of PS10 or DCA was administered intraperitoneally prior to heart extraction. Mouse hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer and 13C tracers (0.12 mm [3-13C]pyruvate, 1.2 mm [3-13C]lactate, and 0.4 mm [U-13C]free fatty acid) as described in “Experimental Procedures.” The representative 13C NMR spectra summed from 88 scans are presented in Fig. 2. Signals from 13CO2, [13C]bicarbonate, [1-13C]pyruvate, [1-13C]alanine, [1-13C]pyruvate hydrate, and [1-13C]lactate are easily detectable by NMR. We also were able to measure the conversion of [1-13C]pyruvate to four-carbon metabolites such as [1-13C]aspartate, [4-13C]aspartate, [1-13C]malate, and [4-13C]malate (Fig. 2). The [13C]bicarbonate signal was decreased in the DIO control group (Fig. 2B) comparing to lean group (Fig. 2A). Both PDK inhibitors, PS10 (Fig. 2C) and DCA (Fig. 2D), restored the [13C]bicarbonate signal in DIO hearts to levels higher than that in the lean control. To visualize the kinetics of HP pyruvate, we plotted the area under the curve of each peak in the 13C spectrum against measurement time (Fig. 3). DIO control hearts trended toward lower [13C]bicarbonate production compared with lean control hearts (Fig. 3A). Both PS10 and DCA demonstrated significant activation of PDC flux generating [13C]bicarbonate (Fig. 3A, left) and 13CO2 (Fig. 3B, left). DCA induced an almost 2-fold increase for total [13C]bicarbonate signal compared with DIO control, whereas PS10 only brought the total signal back to a state similar to lean control (Fig. 3A, right). The result of 13CO2 matched that of [13C]bicarbonate as expected (Fig. 3B). However, DCA also triggered more [1-13C]lactate production than the other three groups (Fig. 3C, left). There is not a significant difference in [1-13C]lactate production among PS10-treated, lean control, and DIO control groups (Fig. 3C, right). We observed no difference in [1-13C]pyruvate signal (Fig. S2A) because the amount of pyruvate is fixed and in excess. The amount of [1-13C]alanine was similar in all groups (Fig. S2B), suggesting PDK inhibitors or high-fat diet did not change the interconversion of pyruvate to alanine. The products of pyruvate carboxylation (Fig. 4A), [1-13C]aspartate (Fig. S2C), [4-13C]aspartate (Fig. S2D), [1-13C]malate (Fig. S2E), and [4-13C]malate (Fig. S2F), were in general higher intensity in DIO control and DCA-treated compared with lean control and PS10 groups. These results strongly suggest that the flux through the malic enzyme (26Sundqvist K.E. Hiltunen J.K. Hassinen I.E. Pyruvate carboxylation in the rat heart. Role of biotin-dependent enzymes.Biochem.

The coupling pattern is shown as S, singlet; D, doublet; T, triplet; Q, quartet. The subscript numbers indicate carbons of the coupling. HP, hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate. Endo, unlabeled pyruvate derived from endogenous sources. Note that no assumption of steady state is needed for this analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the hyperpolarization results, substrate selection was measured in the mouse hearts using 13C isotopomer analysis (28Malloy C.R. Thompson J.R. Jeffrey F.M.H. Sherry A.D. Contribution of exogenous substrates to acetyl coenzyme-A: Measurement by C-13 NMR under non-steady-state conditions.Biochemistry. 1990; 29 (1975750): 6756-676110.1021/bi00481a002Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). An appropriate choice of labeled substrates allows carbohydrate versus fatty acid utilization to be easily analyzed. We chose [3-13C]pyruvate, [3-13C]lactate, and [U-13C]free fatty acids as tracers to study substrate competition (Fig. 4A). During ∼40 min of perfusion, oxygen consumption rates were similar in all groups with slight, but not significant decrease in the PS10 group (Fig. S3). The flow rate and heart rate were unchanged across groups. All hearts were freeze-clamped immediately after the 3-min hyperpolarization data acquisition. From the acid-soluble extract of hearts after perfusion and HP [1-13C]pyruvate injection, we acquired the proton spectra of alanine and lactate, and proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectrum of glutamate (Fig. 4). The 13C labeling in glutamate and glutamine reveals substrate utilization and competition (29Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Jeffrey F.M. Carbon flux through citric acid cycle pathways in perfused heart by 13C NMR spectroscopy.FEBS Lett. 1987; 212 (2879743): 58-6210.1016/0014-5793(87)81556-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The proton signals of the alanine methyl group are composed of the doublet generated by 12C-bonded methyl protons and two satellite doublets because of carbon-proton coupling (1JCH = 124 Hz) of the 13C methyl group (indicated in Fig. 4B). The peaks adjacent to the main doublet come from the long-range carbon-proton coupling (4JCH ∼ 4 Hz), indicating the interaction of 13C labeling on C1 arising from injection of the [1-13C]pyruvate. In the glutamate C4 peaks (Fig. 4C), the doublet of C4-C5 coupling and the quartet of C3-C4/C4-C5 (C4Q) carbon-carbon coupling reflect a strong contribution of fatty acid oxidation to acetyl-CoA production (30Zhao G.

Note that this analysis is made without the assumption of a steady state, but rather indicates the fractions of labeled acetyl-CoA that contributed to the production of glutamate at the instant metabolism was quenched by freeze-clamping. An increasing fraction of D34 and C4S indicates more carbohydrate oxidation. It is clear that both the C4 quartet and D45 are stronger in the DIO control group, with decreased pyruvate anaplerosis in the DCA-treated hearts as evidenced by the increased fraction of C4Q (Fig. 4C). The 13C labeling in glutamate C3 demonstrates similar results of higher PC flux with stronger doublet and triplet of C2-C3/C3-C4 coupling in DIO control group compared to other groups (Fig. 4D). Direct analysis of glutamine C3 and glutamine C4 (Fig. S3) supported similar conclusions. We incorporate the fractional enrichment of the alanine methyl group and direct analysis of glutamate 13C labeling pattern to calculate the substrate utilization (oxidation). In this calculation, we defined “carbohydrate” as the sum of endogenous glycogen and exogenous labeled pyruvate (both 1- and 3-13C) and lactate (3-13C). We observed a trend toward decreased carbohydrate contribution as a fraction of the total acetyl-CoA production in DIO control hearts (Fig. 5A) compared with lean control group, whereas the FFA contribution was trending higher in DIO control (Fig. 5B) compared with lean controls. In DIO mouse hearts, PS10 was able to reverse the changes in substrate preference with significantly increased carbohydrate contribution (Fig. 5A) and significantly decreased FFA contribution compared with DIO control (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, the carbohydrate contribution to the total acetyl-CoA pool was smaller in the DCA group than the PS10 group (Fig. 5A), whereas the fatty acid contribution was not suppressed in the DCA group compared with the PS10 group (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that under our non–steady state experimental conditions, PS10 efficiently modulated PDC activity, whereas DCA did not. Using the relative efficiency of the substrates for the production of NADH per mole of O2 consumed (31Malloy C.R. Jones J.G. Jeffrey F.M. Jessen M.E. Sherry A.D. Contribution of various substrates to total citric acid cycle flux and anaplerosis as determined by 13C isotopomer analysis and O2 consumption in the heart.MAGMA. 1996; 4 (8774000): 35-4610.1007/BF01759778Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the measured O2 consumption, the TCA flux and quantitative contributions of carbohydrates and fatty acids were calculated using the fractional substrate selection obtained from the non–steady state analysis (Fig. 6). The TCA flux in PS10 group trended to be lower than the other groups, but the difference did not reach a significant level with n = 4 (Fig. 6A). There was no difference in absolute turnover between the lean and DIO control groups based on our spectral data. Both PS10 and DCA group had similar carbohydrate contributions to TCA flux as the lean control group (Fig. 6B). However, PS10 significantly down-regulated the FFA contribution to total TCA flux compared not only to the DIO control but also to the DCA group (Fig. 6C). In addition to isotopomer analysis of the glutamate, we chose to perform a steady state analysis of the carbon-13 labeling in glutamine. Glutamine turns over much more slowly than glutamate in the heart, and there was an expectation that it might give a readout of oxidative metabolism prior to the injection of the HP pyruvate. Figs. S4 and S5 showed data similar to those obtained in the glutamate, but in this analysis the fractional contribution of carbohydrates to total TCA flux was significantly raised in the case of PS10 (Fig. S5D). The pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy is complex (32Fang Z.Y. Prins J.B. Marwick T.H. Diabetic cardiomyopathy: evidence, mechanisms, and therapeutic implications.Endocr.

Among many PS that have been investigated, tetracyclines occupy a unique niche. They are potentially dual-action compounds that can both kill bacteria under illumination, and prevent bacterial regrowth by inhibiting ribosomes. Tetracycline antibiotics are regarded as bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. Doxycycline (DOTC) is excited best by UVA light (365 nm) while demeclocycline (DMCT) can be efficiently activated by blue light (415 nm) as well as UVA. Both compounds were able to eradicate Gram-positive (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria (>6 log(10) steps of killing) at concentrations (10–50μM) and fluences (10-20J/cm2). In contrast to methylene blue, MB plus red light, tetracyclines photoinactivated bacteria in rich growth medium. When ~3 logs of bacteria were killed with DMCT/DOTC+light and the surviving cells were added to growth medium, further bacterial killing was observed, while the same experiment with MB allowed complete regrowth. MIC studies were carried out either in the dark or exposed to 0.5mW/cm2 blue light. Up to three extra steps (8-fold) increased antibiotic activity was found with light compared to dark, with MRSA and tetracycline-resistant strains of E. coli. Tetracyclines can accumulate in bacterial ribosomes, where they could be photoactivated with blue/UVA light producing microbial killing via ROS generation."
https://openalex.org/W2801187369,"Among factors impacting performance during an ultramarathon, sleep is an underappreciated factor that has received little attention. The aims of this study were to characterize habitual sleep behaviors in ultramarathon runners and to examine strategies they use to manage sleep before and during ultramarathons. Responses from 636 participants to a questionnaire were considered. This population was found to sleep more on weekends and holidays (7–8 h to 8–9 h) than during weekdays (6–7 h to 7–8 h; p < 0.001). Work was a mediator of napping habits since 19–25% reported napping on work days and 37–56% on non-work days. There were 24.5% of the participants reporting sleep disorders, with more women (38.9%) reporting sleep problems than men (22.0%; p < 0.005). Mean (±SD) sleepiness score on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was 8.9 ± 4.3 with 37.6% of respondents scoring higher than 10, reflecting excessive daytime sleepiness. Most of the study participants (73.9%) had a strategy to manage sleep preceding an ultramarathon, with 54.7% trying to increase their opportunities for sleep. Only 21% of participants reported that they had a strategy to manage sleep during ultramarathons, with micronaps being the most common strategy specified. Sub-analyses from 221 responses indicated that sleep duration during an ultramarathon was correlated with finish time for races lasting 36–60 h (r = 0.48; p < 0.01) or > 60 h (r = 0.44; p < 0.001). We conclude that sleep duration among ultramarathon runners was comparable to the general population and other athletic populations, yet they reported a lower prevalence of sleep disorders. Daytime sleepiness was among the lowest rates encountered in athletic populations, which may be related to the high percentage of nappers in our population. Sleep extension, by increasing sleep time at night and daytime napping, was the main sleep strategy to prepare for ultramarathons."
https://openalex.org/W2800371878,"Genetic selection for body size during domestication of animal species can inadvertently affect a number of physiological and behavioural traits. The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis predicts that domestication in an artificial environment lacking predators and providing abundant resources prefers proactive individuals with strong feeding motivation, high levels of aggression and risk taking, with low hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis responsiveness. In the present experiment we weaned fingerling pike-perch from live feed and habituated them to formulated feed. We recorded the number of weeks needed for the fish to accept pellets, their body length at the age of 100 days, their boldness in a novel object test and their HPI axis responsiveness. Individuals accepting the artificial feed within the first week grew larger than fish habituating later; therefore early weaners would be kept and bred in routine aquaculture procedures. Contrary to predictions of POLS hypothesis, fish weaning earlier and thus growing faster were less bold and had higher HPI axis responsiveness than fish accepting the pellets later or never. As live feed is preferred to artificial pellets, less competitive individuals may switch to pellets earlier. Inadvertent selection for stress sensitive fish may have an effect on production in aquaculture as well as on natural population after intensive restocking."
https://openalex.org/W2799615229,"The ability of the classic startle reflex to evoke voluntarily prepared movement involuntarily has captured the attention of neuroscientists for its wide-ranging functional utility and potential uses in patient populations. To date, there is only one documented task resistant to the startReact phenomenon–index finger abduction. Previous reports have suggested the lack of startReact is due to different neural mechanisms driving individuated finger movement and more proximal joint control (e.g. elbow, wrist movement). However, an alternative hypothesis exists. Though not particularly difficult to execute, isolated index finger abduction is rarely performed during activities of daily living and is not a natural correlate to common individuated finger tasks. We propose that startReact can be evoked during individuated finger movements but only during tasks that are highly trained or familiar. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of a 2-week training regimen on the ability to elicit startReact. We found evidence in support of our hypothesis that following training, individuated movements of the hands (specifically index finger abduction) become susceptible to startReact. This is significant not only because it indicates that individuated finger movements are in fact amenable to startReact, but also that startle has differential response characteristics in novel tasks compared to highly trained tasks suggesting that startle is a measurable behavioral indicator of motor learning."
https://openalex.org/W2800168921,"Background Relatively little is understood about which factors influence students’ choice of specialty and when learners ultimately make this decision. Objective The objective is to understand how experiences of medical students relate to the timing of selection of Emergency Medicine (EM) as a specialty. Of specific interest were factors such as how earlier and more positive specialty exposure may impact the decision-making process of medical students. Methods A cross-sectional survey study of EM bound 4th year US medical students (MD and DO) was performed exploring when and why students choose EM as their specialty. An electronic survey was distributed in March 2015 to all medical students who applied to an EM residency at 4 programs representing different geographical regions. Descriptive analyses and multinomial logistic regressions were performed. Results 793/1372 (58%) responded. Over half had EM experience prior to medical school. When students selected EM varied: 13.9% prior to, 50.4% during, and 35.7% after their M3 year. Early exposure, presence of an EM residency program, previous employment in the ED, experience as a pre-hospital provider, and completion of an M3 EM clerkship were associated with earlier selection. Delayed exposure to EM was associated with later selection of EM. Conclusions Early exposure and prior life experiences were associated with choosing EM earlier in medical school. The third year was identified as the most common time for definitively choosing the specialty."
https://openalex.org/W2801114248,"The neural mechanisms underlying visual perceptual learning (VPL) have typically been studied by examining changes in task-related brain activation after training. However, the relationship between post-task “offline” processes and VPL remains unclear. The present study examined this question by obtaining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of human brains before and after a task-fMRI session involving visual perceptual training. During the task-fMRI session, participants performed a motion coherence discrimination task in which they judged the direction of moving dots with a coherence level that varied between trials (20, 40, and 80%). We found that stimulus-induced activation increased with motion coherence in the middle temporal cortex (MT+), a feature-specific region representing visual motion. On the other hand, stimulus-induced activation decreased with motion coherence in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and bilateral insula, regions involved in decision making under perceptual ambiguity. Moreover, by comparing pre-task and post-task rest periods, we revealed that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) with the MT+ was significantly increased after training in widespread cortical regions including the bilateral sensorimotor and temporal cortices. In contrast, rs-FC with the MT+ was significantly decreased in subcortical regions including the thalamus and putamen. Importantly, the training-induced change in rs-FC was observed only with the MT+, but not with the dACC or insula. Thus, our findings suggest that perceptual training induces plastic changes in offline functional connectivity specifically in brain regions representing the trained visual feature, emphasising the distinct roles of feature-representation regions and decision-related regions in VPL."
https://openalex.org/W2802394760,"Neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are characterized by progressive neuronal loss and pathological accumulation of some proteins. Developing new biomarkers for both diseases is highly important for the early diagnosis and possible development of neuro-protective strategies. Serum antibodies (AIAs) against neuronal proteins are potential biomarkers for AD and PD that may be formed in response to their release into systemic circulation after brain damage. In the present study, two AIAs (tubulin and tau) were measured in sera of patients of PD and AD, compared to healthy controls. Results showed that both antibodies were elevated in patients with PD and AD compared to match controls. Curiously, the profile of elevation of antibodies was different in both diseases. In PD cases, tubulin and tau AIAs levels were similar. On the other hand, AD patients showed more elevation of tau AIAs compared to tubulin. Our current results suggested that AIAs panel could be able to identify cases with neuro-degeneration when compared with healthy subjects. More interestingly, it is possible to differentiate between PD and AD cases through identifying specific AIAs profile for each neurodegenerative states."

We established a new antibiotic selection marker for C. elegans transformation based on nourseothricin (NTC) and its resistance-encoding gene, streptothricin-acetyl transferase 2 (Sat2). NTC was able to efficiently prevent worm development at very low concentrations, and the worms expressing Sat2 were able to survive on the selection plates without any developmental defects. Using CRISPR/Cas9 and NTC selection, we were able to easily insert a 13-kb expression cassette into a defined locus in C. elegans. The structure and spectrum of NTC differs from other antibiotics like hygromycin B and geneticin, making it possible to use NTC alongside them. Indeed, we confirmed NTC-sat2 selection could work with the hygromycin B selection system simultaneously. Thus, the new NTC–Sat2 system can act as a useful dominant marker for gene transfer and genome editing in C. elegans."

Due to inter-tumor genetic heterogeneity, many driver mutations occur at low frequencies, which make it challenging to distinguish them from passenger mutations. Here, we show that a novel Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach, named rDriver can achieve enhanced prediction accuracy by identifying mutations that not only have high functional impact scores but also are associated with systemic variation in gene expression levels. In examining 3,080 tumor samples from 8 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas, rDriver predicted 1,389 driver mutations. Compared with existing tools, rDriver identified more low frequency mutations associated with lineage specific functional properties, timing of occurrence and patient survival. Evaluation of rDriver predictions using engineered cell-line models resulted in a positive predictive value of 0.94 in PIK3CA genes. Our study highlights the importance of integrating multi-omic data in predicting cancer driver mutations and provides a statistically rigorous solution for cancer target discovery and development."

This implicit statistical knowledge can be alternatively expressed via abstract medium such as musical melody, which suggests this knowledge is reflected in melodies written by a composer. This study investigates how statistics in music vary over a composer's lifetime. Transitional probabilities of highest-pitch sequences in Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata were calculated based on different hierarchical Markov models. Each interval pattern was ordered based on the sonata opus number. The transitional probabilities of sequential patterns that are musical universal in music gradually decreased, suggesting that time-course variations of statistics in music reflect time-course variations of a composer's statistical knowledge. This study sheds new light on novel methodologies that may be able to evaluate the time-course variation of composer's implicit knowledge using musical scores."

We have in here investigated the impact of one such compound, paquinimod, on the development of diabetes in the NOD mouse model for type I diabetes (T1D). In cohorts of NOD mice treated with paquinimod between weeks 10 to 20 of age and followed up until 40 weeks of age, we observed dose-dependent reduction in incidence of disease as well as delayed onset of disease. Further, in contrast to untreated controls, the majority of NOD mice treated from 15 weeks of age did not develop diabetes at 30 weeks of age. Importantly, these mice displayed significantly less insulitis, which correlated with selectively reduced number of splenic macrophages and splenic Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes at end point as compared to untreated controls. Collectively, these results demonstrate that paquinimod treatment can significantly inhibit progression of insulitis to T1D in the NOD mouse. We propose that the effect of paquinimod on disease progression may be related to the reduced number of these myeloid cell populations. Our finding also indicates that this compound could be a candidate for clinical development towards diabetes therapy in humans."

In this context, the aim of this work was to study the codon usage bias in a natural consortium of five acidophilic bacteria used for biomining. The codon usage bias of the consortium was contrasted with genes from an alternative collection of acidophilic reference strains and metagenome samples. Results indicate that acidophilic bacteria preferentially have low codon usage bias, consistent with both their capacity to live in a wide range of habitats and their slow growth rate, a characteristic probably acquired independently from their phylogenetic relationships. In addition, the analysis showed significant differences in the unique sets of genes from the autotrophic species of the consortium in relation to other acidophilic organisms, principally in genes which code for proteins involved in metal and oxidative stress resistance. The lower values of codon usage bias obtained in this unique set of genes suggest higher transcriptional adaptation to living in extreme conditions, which was probably acquired as a measure for resisting the elevated metal conditions present in the mine."

We have recently reported that xyloside-primed chondroitin/dermatan sulfate derived from a human breast carcinoma cell line, HCC70, has cytotoxic effects and shown that it differs in disaccharide composition from nontoxic chondroitin/dermatan sulfate derived from a human breast fibroblast cell line, CCD-1095Sk. To further investigate the structural requirements for the cytotoxic effect, we developed a novel LC-MS/MS approach based on reversed-phase dibutylamine ion-pairing chromatography and negative-mode higher-energy collision dissociation and used it in combination with cell growth studies and disaccharide fingerprinting. This strategy enabled detailed structural characterization of linkage regions, internal oligosaccharides, and nonreducing ends, revealing not only differences between xyloside-primed chondroitin/dermatan sulfate from HCC70 cells and CCD-1095Sk cells, but also sialylation of the linkage region and previously undescribed methylation and sulfation of the nonreducing ends. Although the xyloside-primed chondroitin/dermatan sulfate from HCC70 cells was less complex in terms of presence and distribution of iduronic acid than that from CCD-1095Sk cells, both glucuronic acid and iduronic acid appeared to be essential for the cytotoxic effect. Our data have moved us one step closer to understanding the structure of the cytotoxic chondroitin/dermatan sulfate from HCC70 cells primed on xylosides and demonstrate the suitability of the LC-MS/MS approach for structural characterization of glycosaminoglycans."

Identifying economic and convenient methods to control soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) pollution in urban runoff is the key point of rainwater management strategies. Through three series of different tests involving influencing factors, continuous operation and intermittent operation, this study explored the purification effects of bioretention tanks under different experimental conditions, it included nine intermittent tests, single field continuous test with three groups of different fillers (Fly ash mixed with sand, Blast furnace slag, and Soil), and eight intermittent tests with single filler (Blast furnace slag mixed with sand). Among the three filler combinations studied, the filler with fly ash mixed with sand achieved the best pollution reduction efficiency. The setting of the submerged zone exerted minimal influence on the P removal of the three filler combinations. An extension of the dry period slightly promoted the P purification effect. The combination of fly ash mixed with sand demonstrated a positive purification effect on SRP during short- or long-term simulated rainfall duration. Blast furnace slag also presented a positive purification effect in the short term, although its continuous purification effect on SRP was poor in the long term. The purification abilities of soil in the short and long terms were weak. Under intermittent operations across different seasons, SRP removal was unstable, and effluent concentration processes were different. The purification effect of the bioretention system on SRP was predicted through partial least squares regression (PLS) modeling analysis. The event mean concentration removal of SRP was positively related to the adsorption capacity of filler and rainfall interval time and negatively related to submerged zones, influent concentration and volume."

Functional and structural data underwent automated preprocessing steps in SPM and Freesurfer, correspondingly. The groups were compared employing mass-univariate strategy within the generalized linear modelling framework. CHR demonstrated reduced suppression of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions during n-back task. We also found that, consistent with previous findings, CHR subjects demonstrated thinning in prefrontal, cingulate, insular and inferior temporal areas, as well as reduced hippocampal volumes.

Tracking the progress of scientific research and knowledge through the translational process is difficult due to variation in the definition of translational research as well as the identification of benchmarks for the spread and application of biomedical research; quantitatively tracking this process is even more difficult. Using a simple and reproducible method to assess whether publications are translational, we examined NIH R01 behavioral and social science research (BSSR) awards funded between 2008 and 2014 to determine whether there are differences in the percent of translational research publications produced by basic and applied research awards. We also assessed the percent of translational research publications produced by the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) program to evaluate whether targeted translational research awards result in increased translational research. We found that 3.9% of publications produced by basic research awards were translational; that the percent of translational research publications produced by applied research awards is approximately double that of basic research awards (7.4%); and that targeted translational research awards from the CTSA program produced the highest percentage of translational research publications (13.4%). In addition, we assessed differences in time to first publication, time to first citation, and publication quality by award type (basic vs. applied), and whether an award (or publication) is translational."
https://openalex.org/W2799601160,"In the development of antiviral drugs that target viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, off-target toxicity caused by the inhibition of the human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) is a major liability. Therefore, it is essential that all new ribonucleoside analogue drugs be accurately screened for POLRMT inhibition. A computational tool that can accurately predict NTP binding to POLRMT could assist in evaluating any potential toxicity and in designing possible salvaging strategies. Using the available crystal structure of POLRMT bound to an RNA transcript, here we created a model of POLRMT with an NTP molecule bound in the active site. Furthermore, we implemented a computational screening procedure that determines the relative binding free energy of an NTP analogue to POLRMT by free energy perturbation (FEP), i.e. a simulation in which the natural NTP molecule is slowly transformed into the analogue and back. In each direction, the transformation was performed over 40 ns of simulation on our IBM Blue Gene Q supercomputer. This procedure was validated across a panel of drugs for which experimental dissociation constants were available, showing that NTP relative binding free energies could be predicted to within 0.97 kcal/mol of the experimental values on average. These results demonstrate for the first time that free-energy simulation can be a useful tool for predicting binding affinities of NTP analogues to a polymerase. We expect that our model, together with similar models of viral polymerases, will be very useful in the screening and future design of NTP inhibitors of viral polymerases that have no mitochondrial toxicity.

We expect that our model, together with similar models of viral polymerases, will be very useful in the screening and future design of NTP inhibitors of viral polymerases that have no mitochondrial toxicity. The mitochondria contain their own circular dsDNA genome that encodes 13 proteins involved in the electron transfer chain, in addition to 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs (1Arnold J.J. Smidansky E.D.

The inhibition of viral polymerases by nucleoside analogues has been the cornerstone of therapies against multiple pathogenic viruses, including HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Herpesvirus. In particular, many viruses possessing RNA genomes, such as HCV, use RNA-dependent RNA polymerases for replication, which have been very successful targets for the development of antiviral drugs including ribonucleoside analogues. Ribonucleoside analogue drugs are converted to their active ribonucleoside triphosphate form by human kinases. After more than a decade of research aimed at identifying an anti-HCV ribonucleoside analogue, sofosbuvir was approved for medical use in the United States in 2013. Along the way, multiple attempts to develop ribonucleoside antivirals had to be discontinued because of toxicity, including NM283, R1626, PSI-938, and BMS-986094 (2Jin Z. Kinkade A. Behera I.

It had been known for years that deoxyribonucleoside analogues were associated with side effects caused by mitochondrial toxicity and off-target interactions with mitochondrial DNA polymerase in particular (6Cihlar T.

However, it was not until 2012 that research performed by Arnold et al. (3Arnold J.J. Sharma S.D. Feng J.Y. Ray A.S. Smidansky E.D. Kireeva M.L. Cho A. Perry J. Vela J.E. Park Y. Xu Y. Tian Y.

This work emphasized the need for setting up accurate screening tests for the interactions of ribonucleoside antivirals with POLRMT. One serious concern cited was that although nuclear RNA polymerase II has a proofreading mechanism through the activity of TFIIS, there does not seem to be any nucleotide excision mechanism in place for POLRMT (3Arnold J.J. Sharma S.D. Feng J.Y. Ray A.S. Smidansky E.D. Kireeva M.L. Cho A. Perry J. Vela J.E. Park Y. Xu Y. Tian Y. Babusis D. Barauskus O.

Pyrimidine nucleotide analogues pose an even greater risk for POLRMT inhibition than ATP derivatives, because CTP and UTP are present at 1–2 orders of magnitude lower concentrations in the mitochondria than ATP (1Arnold J.J. Smidansky E.D. Moustafa I.M. Cameron C.E. Human mitochondrial RNA polymerase: structure-function, mechanism and inhibition.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1819 (22551784): 948-96010.1016/j.bbagrm.2012.04.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On the computational side, one previous predictive model of the mitochondrial toxicity of pharmaceutical drugs has focused on a cheminformatics approach (7Nelms M.D. Mellor C.L. Cronin M.T. Madden J.C. Enoch S.J. Development of an in silico profiler for mitochondrial toxicity.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2015; 28 (26375963): 1891-190210.1021/acs.chemrestox.5b00275Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here we describe the development of a computational model based upon the available crystal structure (8Schwinghammer K. Cheung A.C. Morozov Y.I. Agaronyan K. Temiakov D. Cramer P. Structure of human mitochondrial RNA polymerase elongation complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 (24096365): 1298-130310.1038/nsmb.2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that allows for the accurate prediction of relative binding affinities of NTPs to the POLRMT structure. The detailed molecular structure of POLRMT as a closed-product elongation complex bound to template DNA and a small RNA transcript has been provided by X-ray crystallography, allowing for insights into NTP binding within the active site (Protein Data Bank code 4BOC) (8Schwinghammer K. Cheung A.C. Morozov Y.I. Agaronyan K. Temiakov D. Cramer P. Structure of human mitochondrial RNA polymerase elongation complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 (24096365): 1298-130310.1038/nsmb.2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The closed product is one of four stages of the nucleotide addition cycle of polymerases. In this cycle, an NTP first binds to the open post-translocated state of the polymerase, the complex undergoes a conformational change to the new pre-translocated insertion state, chemical reaction occurs leading to the closed product state, and finally translocation returns the system to the open product complex (9Ng K.K. Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. Structure-function relationships among RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2008; 320 (18268843): 137-156PubMed Google Scholar). To assess POLRMT inhibition, we had to create a model of the pre-translocated insertion state. We therefore adjusted the 4BOC structure to make it representative of the insertion state by using the crystal structure of the insertion state of the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase to which POLRMT is evolutionarily related (10Masters B.S. Stohl L.L. Clayton D.A. Yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase is homologous to those encoded by bacteriophages T3 and T7.Cell. 1987; 51 (3308116): 89-9910.1016/0092-8674(87)90013-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 11Cermakian N.

We also constructed models with each of ATP and GTP in the POLRMT nucleotide-binding site. In our model development and validation, we take advantage of the experimentally determined dissociation constants for a panel of NTP analogues that were determined using a biochemical assay by Arnold et al. (3Arnold J.J. Sharma S.D. Feng J.Y. Ray A.S. Smidansky E.D. Kireeva M.L. Cho A. Perry J. Vela J.E. Park Y. Xu Y. Tian Y. Babusis D. Barauskus O.

The binding free-energy differences of these NTP analogues are determined relative to the binding free energies of the respective natural NTPs using the FEP methodology. FEP has the advantage over other less rigorous methods of being formally exact in the limit of complete phase-space sampling but requires lengthy simulations (13Zwanzig R.W.

Although using FEP to determine binding free energies is quite well-studied (16Deng Y. Roux B. Computations of standard binding free energies with molecular dynamics simulations.J. Phys. Chem.

Binding free energies of NTP analogues to polymerases are particularly hard to compute as averages over molecular dynamics simulations because of the high negative charge of −4e on nucleoside triphosphates; that is, the response in the fluctuation of the environment to fluctuations in the positions of the charged phosphates and metal ions may be expected to occur on a slower time scale than for systems with less charge polarization, leading to slow convergence of computed binding free energies. To converge results, we have performed lengthy simulations on our IBM Blue Gene Q supercomputer (see below for details). We note that in FEP, only relative binding free energies are calculated, i.e. binding free-energy differences between different NTPs, instead of absolute binding free energies. This facilitates convergence because fluctuations in energy caused by fluctuations in charge density cancel out when the energetic difference is calculated for two NTPs. Relative binding free energies are determined using a thermodynamic cycle, i.e. from the difference between the free energy change for the transformation of the natural NTP to its analogue in aqueous solution and the corresponding free energy change within the solvated protein-bound environment (19Kollman P.A. Free energy calculations: Applications to chemical and biochemical phenomena.Chem. Rev. 1993; 93: 2395-241710.1021/cr00023a004Crossref Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). The FEP approach presented here can be applied to the rational salvaging of drug candidates found to inhibit POLRMT and moreover can be extended to applications to viral polymerases in general. When combined with experimental testing, it suggests an efficient strategic means for identifying nucleoside antivirals with high specificity and affinity for viral polymerases, leading to the design of safe and effective drugs. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of our model of the POLRMT NTP insertion state, which is based on the 4BOC (8Schwinghammer K. Cheung A.C. Morozov Y.I. Agaronyan K. Temiakov D. Cramer P. Structure of human mitochondrial RNA polymerase elongation complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 (24096365): 1298-130310.1038/nsmb.2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) crystal structure of the POLRMT elongation complex. POLRMT is a 1230-amino acid protein consisting of three domains, namely the N-terminal extension (NTE) located at the very N terminus of the protein (residues 1–368), the N-terminal domain (residues 369–647) that follows the NTE in the primary sequence, and the C-terminal polymerase domain (residues 648–1230) (1Arnold J.J. Smidansky E.D. Moustafa I.M. Cameron C.E. Human mitochondrial RNA polymerase: structure-function, mechanism and inhibition.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1819 (22551784): 948-96010.1016/j.bbagrm.2012.04.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The polymerase domain has the classic structure resembling a cupped right hand as is seen in the RNA-dependent polymerases of viruses and bacteriophages and in DNA polymerases (Fig. 1). It has 41% sequence similarity and 25% sequence identity to T7 RNA polymerase (20Choi K.H. Viral polymerases.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2012; 726 (22297518): 267-30410.1007/978-1-4614-0980-9_12Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The pentatricopeptide repeat, making up the C terminus of the NTE, the N-terminal domain, and the C-terminal domain all are present in the 4BOC crystal structure and in our model. The NTP-binding pocket is located on top of the center of the palm and is formed mainly by structural motifs A and C, and the helical motif B, also known as the O-helix, belonging to the fingers region (Fig. 2A). Conserved residues within the active site contribute to the formation of the catalytic complex. Several residues are involved in coordinating the two active site Mg2+ metal ions, A and B (Fig. 2A). In our model (Fig. 2A), the side chains of two conserved Asp residues, Asp922 and Asp1151, respectively, belonging to motifs A and C help to coordinate metal A, along with the 3′OH O atom of the NTP, an α-phosphoryl O atom of the NTP, the main-chain carbonyl O atom of Gly923, and a water molecule. Metal B is coordinated by β- and γ-phosphoryl O atoms of the NTP, the Asp922 side chain, and three water molecules. The NTP is bound to the polymerase principally by the electrostatic interaction between the highly charged triphosphate group and positively charged residues in the active site, namely Lys853, Arg987, and Lys991 (8Schwinghammer K. Cheung A.C. Morozov Y.I. Agaronyan K. Temiakov D. Cramer P. Structure of human mitochondrial RNA polymerase elongation complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 (24096365): 1298-130310.1038/nsmb.2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2A, the NTP is also stabilized by a sulfur-π interaction with residue M995 belonging to the O-helix in our model. A bound NTP is thought to be distinguished from a deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate because of the hydrogen bond formed by the NTP 2′OH to residue Tyr999 (8Schwinghammer K. Cheung A.C. Morozov Y.I. Agaronyan K. Temiakov D. Cramer P. Structure of human mitochondrial RNA polymerase elongation complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 (24096365): 1298-130310.1038/nsmb.2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). In Fig. 3, we plot the distance between the hydroxyl H atom of the Tyr999 side chain and the 2′-hydroxyl O atom of the bound ribonucleotide as a function of time for the second half of the simulation of the CTP-bound complex (A) and for the ATP- and GTP-bound complexes (B and C, respectively). Based on the plots, whereas the hydrogen bond is largely maintained throughout all three simulations, the hydrogen bond distance is significantly larger on average for the CTP-bound complex than for the two purine-nucleotide-bound complexes. This hydrogen bond is particularly stable for the ATP-bound complex. The nucleotidyl transfer mechanism of POLRMT includes two proton transfer reactions, and conserved residues help to catalyze this mechanism (21Castro C. Smidansky E.D. Arnold J.J. Maksimchuk K.R. Moustafa I. Uchida A. Götte M. Konigsberg W. Cameron C.E. Nucleic acid polymerases use a general acid for nucleotidyl transfer.Nat. Struct. Mol.

The first proton transfer occurs during the nucleophilic attack of the RNA transcript's 3′ hydroxyl O atom on the α-phosphate of the incoming NTP to create a new phosphodiester bond. During this step, a proton is transferred from the 3′-hydroxyl O atom to a catalytic base, thought to be Asp1151 (8Schwinghammer K. Cheung A.C. Morozov Y.I. Agaronyan K. Temiakov D. Cramer P. Structure of human mitochondrial RNA polymerase elongation complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 (24096365): 1298-130310.1038/nsmb.2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). In Fig. 3, we plotted the distance between the acidic O atom of the Asp1151 side chain and the 3′-hydroxyl H atom H3T of the bound nucleotide as a function of time for each of the CTP-, ATP-, and GTP-bound complexes; note that this distance is on average much closer for both the purine-nucleotide-bound complexes than for the CTP-bound complex. Metal A stabilizes this proton transfer by lowering the pkA of the 3′-hydroxyl group. In the course of the nucleotide addition reaction, the pyrophosphate leaving group also becomes protonated in the second proton-transfer reaction, with a residue from the O-helix acting as the proton donor (1Arnold J.J. Smidansky E.D. Moustafa I.M. Cameron C.E. Human mitochondrial RNA polymerase: structure-function, mechanism and inhibition.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1819 (22551784): 948-96010.1016/j.bbagrm.2012.04.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and metal B helping to stabilize this acid-catalysis step. In Fig. 3, we also plot the ribose pucker, or pseudorotation angle, as a function of time for the NTP molecule belonging to each of the three nucleotide-bound complexes. In the case of the ATP- and GTP-bound complexes, the pseudorotation angle generally lies in the interval from −144 to −108°, known as the C4′-endo configuration. For CTP-bound POLRMT, the pseudorotation angle is generally either in the C4′-endo configuration or in the C3′-exo configuration (−180 to −144°) or more rarely in the C2′-endo configuration (144 to 180°) or in the O4′-exo configuration (−108 to −72°) (24Saenger W. Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure. Springer, New York1984: 19Google Scholar). As mentioned above, during nucleotide addition, the POLRMT catalytic complex cycles from an open state to a closed state and back. It has been suggested that this cycling is driven by the interaction between the O-helix and the incoming NTP (1Arnold J.J. Smidansky E.D. Moustafa I.M. Cameron C.E. Human mitochondrial RNA polymerase: structure-function, mechanism and inhibition.Biochim. Biophys.

As the NTP enters, the complex is in an open state and later forms a catalytically competent closed or clenched state in which the fingers, including the Y-helix, reposition, and the entrance to the active site is temporarily blocked (1Arnold J.J. Smidansky E.D. Moustafa I.M. Cameron C.E. Human mitochondrial RNA polymerase: structure-function, mechanism and inhibition.Biochim. Biophys.

Cramer P. Structure of human mitochondrial RNA polymerase elongation complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 (24096365): 1298-130310.1038/nsmb.2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In Fig. 4A, we show a comparison between the positions of the fingers in our model of the CTP-bound POLRMT complex and their corresponding positions in the aligned 4BOC structure of the closed product complex. As might be expected, the fingers take on a somewhat more open configuration in our model of the nucleotide insertion state compared with in the closed-product elongation complex. We have also computed the tilt angle as a function of time for the bundle of helices in the fingers domain including the O- and Y-helices and the helices composed of residues 954–974, 1024–1044, and 1044–1064, respectively, for the CTP-bound POLRMT complex (Fig. 5). It may be seen from the figure that all of the helices reorient within the bundle. The O and Y helices and the 1044–1064 helix eventually settle into new stable conformations, whereas the helices composed of residues 954–974 and 1024–1044, respectively, continue to undergo large fluctuations in helical tilt during the second half of the simulation. The thumb domain (residues 705–790) contains a long α-helix that interacts with and stabilizes the DNA template during transcript elongation (1Arnold J.J. Smidansky E.D. Moustafa I.M. Cameron C.E.

In Fig. 4A, we compare its position in our model of the insertion state to its position in the crystal structure of the closed product state. Like the fingers domain, it also appears more open in our model of the insertion state compared with in the closed product complex. The intercalating hairpin of POLRMT (residues 591–624) separates the upstream DNA template strand from the RNA transcript in the elongation complex. The separation of upstream DNA from the transcript allows for the displacement of the transcript and its exit through a channel toward the back of the complex oriented as shown in Figure 1, Figure 4. This interaction involves residues Ile620 and Ile618 in the 4BOC crystal structure (8Schwinghammer K. Cheung A.C. Morozov Y.I. Agaronyan K. Temiakov D. Cramer P.

In our model in Fig. 4B, the intercalating hairpin, colored in brown, has moved closer to the template DNA strand by comparison to its position in 4BOC, shown in light green. Our model contains two active site histidine residues, one of which, His1150, is near the ribose moiety of the bound NTP molecule, and the other of which, His1125, is separated from the NTP by residue Tyr999. Because the charge states of these two histidine residues may impact the strength of nucleotide binding in our calculations, we first sought to determine these charge states by performing explicitly solvated constant pH molecular dynamics simulations.

While their efficacy is well documented for neuropathic pain, the evidence is less clear in musculoskeletal pain conditions. The present study therefore evaluated the effect of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine on chronic low-back pain in a randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled design. To explore the mechanisms of action and the influence of drug metabolism, multimodal quantitative sensory tests (QST) and genotyping for cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) were additionally performed. A single oral dose of imipramine 75 mg was compared to active placebo (tolterodine 1 mg) in 50 patients (32 females) with chronic non-specific low-back pain. Intensity of low-back pain was assessed on a 0–10 numeric rating scale at baseline and every 30 minutes after drug intake. Multimodal QST were performed at baseline and in hourly intervals for 2 hours. Pharmacogenetic influences of cytochrome P450 were addressed by CYP2D6 genotyping. No significant analgesic effect was detected neither on low-back pain nor on any of the sensory tests in the overall analyses. However, evidence for an interaction of the imipramine effect and CYP2D6 genotype was found for electrical and for pressure pain detection thresholds. Intermediate but not extensive metabolizers had a 1.20 times greater electrical pain threshold (95%-CI 1.10 to 1.31) and a 1.10 times greater pressure pain threshold (95%-CI 1.01 to 1.21) 60 minutes after imipramine than after placebo (p<0.001 and p = 0.034, respectively). The present study failed to demonstrate an immediate analgesic effect of imipramine on low-back pain. Anti-nociceptive effects as assessed by quantitative sensory tests may depend on CYP2D6 genotype, indicating that metabolizer status should be accounted for when future studies with tricyclic antidepressants are undertaken."
https://openalex.org/W2800853634,"Cobalamin [Cbl (or B12)] deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia and a variety of neuropathies. However, homeostatic mechanisms of cyanocobalamin (CNCbl) and other Cbls by vascular endothelial cells are poorly understood. Herein, we describe our investigation into whether cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) perform transcytosis of B12, namely, the complex formed between serum transcobalamin and B12, designated as holo- transcobalamin (holo-TC). We show that cultured BAECs endocytose [57Co]-CNCbl-TC (source material) via the CD320 receptor. The bound Cbl is transported across the cell both via exocytosis in its free form, [57Co]-CNCbl, and via transcytosis as [57Co]-CNCbl-TC. Transcellular mobilization of Cbl occurred in a bidirectional manner. A portion of the endocytosed [57Co]-CNCbl was enzymatically processed by methylmalonic aciduria combined with homocystinuria type C (cblC) with subsequent formation of hydroxocobalamin, methylcobalamin, and adenosylcobalamin, which were also transported across the cell in a bidirectional manner. This demonstrates that transport mechanisms for Cbl in vascular endothelial cells do not discriminate between various β-axial ligands of the vitamin. Competition studies with apoprotein- and holo-TC and holo-intrinsic factor showed that only holo-TC was effective at inhibiting transcellular transport of Cbl. Incubation of BAECs with a blocking antibody against the extracellular domain of the CD320 receptor inhibited uptake and transcytosis by ~40%. This study reveals that endothelial cells recycle uncommitted intracellular Cbl for downstream usage by other cell types and suggests that the endothelium is self-sufficient for the specific acquisition and subsequent distribution of circulating B12 via the CD320 receptor. We posit that the endothelial lining of the vasculature is an essential component for the maintenance of serum- tissue homeostasis of B12.—Hannibal, L., Bolisetty, K., Axhemi, A., DiBello, P.

https://openalex.org/W2802867399,"How to effectively solve traffic congestion and transportation pollution in urban development is a main research emphasis for transportation management agencies. A carbon emissions tax can affect travelers' generalized costs and will lead to changes in passenger demand, mode choice and traffic flow equilibrium in road networks, which are of significance in green travel and low-carbon transportation management. This paper first established a mesoscopic model to calculate the carbon emissions tax and determined the value of this charge in China, which was based on road traffic flow, vehicle speed, and carbon emissions. Referring to existing research results to calibrate the value of time, this paper modified the traveler's generalized cost function, including the carbon emissions tax, fuel surcharge and travel time cost, which can be used in the travel impedance model with the consideration of the carbon emissions tax. Then, a method for analyzing urban road network traffic flow distribution was put forward, and a joint traffic distribution model was established, which considered the relationship between private cars and taxis. Finally, this paper took the city of Panjin as an example to analyze the road traffic carbon emissions tax's impact. The results illustrated that the carbon emissions tax has a positive effect on road network flow equilibrium and carbon emission reduction. This paper will have good reference value and practical significance for the calculation and implementation of urban traffic carbon emissions taxes in China."
https://openalex.org/W4249216739,"Here we utilize a non-Fourier approach to model buoyancy aiding or opposing flow of Maxwell fluid in the region of stagnation-point towards a vertical stretchable surface. Flow field is permeated by uniform transverse magnetic field. Two different heating processes namely (i) prescribed surface temperature (PST) and (ii) constant wall temperature (CWT) are analyzed. Through suitable transformations, the similarity equations are formed which are treated numerically for a broad range of magnetic interaction parameter. The obtained solutions are compared with available articles under limiting situations and such comparisons appear convincing. The structure of boundary layer depends on a parameter measuring the ratio of free stream velocity to the stretching sheet velocity. The momentum transport via stretching boundary is opposed by both fluid relaxation time and magnetic interaction parameter. Thermal boundary layer expands as the effects of transverse magnetic field and thermal relaxation time are amplified. A reduction in heat penetration depth is anticipated for increasing values of thermal relaxation time. The variation in wall slope of temperature with increasing thermal relaxation time appears similar at any assigned value of Prandtl number. A comparative study of aiding and opposition flow situations is presented and deliberated."
https://openalex.org/W2800906581,"Goat breeding has become an important sector in Eastern Europe, with Romania and Hungary being among the major producer countries. Given the limited number of research done up-to-date concerning genetic studies of indigenous goat breeds reared in Romania and Hungary, the current preliminary study aimed to analyze the variability of genes related to mastitis and gastrointestinal parasitism by using Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP™). We studied 52 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) belonging to 19 genes in indigenous breeds from both countries, namely Banat’s White (n = 36), Carpatina (n = 35) from Romania and Hungarian Milking (n = 79) and identified 16 polymorphic SNPs among 10 genes (PTX3, IL6, CLEC4E, IL8, IL1RN, IL15RA, TNFSF13, SOCS3, TNF and TLR3) in 150 animals. Furthermore, the diversity of the studied breeds was investigated. The PIC values ranged from 0.042 to 0.691. The mean values of observed and expected heterozygosity were 0.235 and 0.246 respectively. The highest observed heterozygosity was obtained for IL15RA g.10343904C>T in Banat’s White (0.464), IL15RA g.10354813C>T in Carpatina (0.577) and SOCS3 g.52626440T>G in Hungarian Milking (0.588). Pairwise FST values between the Romanian breeds and Romanian and Hungarian breeds were small (0.009 and 0.015), indicating the close relationship among the studied goat populations. From all the polymorphic SNPs identified, the Hungarian Milking breed showed the highest proportion of polymorphisms (100%), whereas the Carpatina breed had the lowest percentage (87.5%). The highest value of MAF was obtained for SOCS3 g.52626440T>G (0.46), IL15RA g.10343904C>T (0.47), IL15RA g.10344025C>T (0.45), and IL15RA g.10354813C>T (0.42). The 16 polymorphic SNPs identified in a panel of 150 unrelated individuals belonging to three Romanian and Hungarian indigenous goat breeds could be used in future genomic based breeding schemes as markers for genetic resistance to mastitis and gastrointestinal parasitism in goat breeds found in Eastern and Central Europe."
https://openalex.org/W2802177529,"Background Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at an increased risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We assessed for the first time whether urinary free light chains (FLC) are independently associated with risk of ESRD in patients with CKD, and whether they offer incremental value in risk stratification. Materials and methods We measured urinary FLCs in 556 patients with CKD from a prospective cohort study. The association between urinary kappa/creatinine (KCR) and lambda/creatinine (LCR) ratios and development of ESRD was assessed by competing-risks regression (to account for the competing risk of death). The change in C-statistic and integrated discrimination improvement were used to assess the incremental value of adding KCR or LCR to the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE). Results 136 participants developed ESRD during a median follow-up time of 51 months. Significant associations between KCR and LCR and risk of ESRD became non-significant after adjustment for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), although having a KCR or LCR >75th centile remained independently associated with risk of ESRD. Neither KCR nor LCR as continuous or categorical variables provided incremental value when added to the KFRE for estimating risk of ESRD at two years. Conclusions Urinary FLCs have an association with progression to ESRD in patients with CKD which appears to be explained to a degree by their correlation with eGFR and ACR. Levels above the 75th centile do have an independent association with ESRD, but do not improve upon a current model for risk stratification."
https://openalex.org/W2802212608,"When attempting to statistically distinguish between a null and an alternative hypothesis, many researchers in the life and social sciences turn to binned statistical analysis methods, or methods that are simply based on the moments of a distribution (such as the mean, and variance). These methods have the advantage of simplicity of implementation, and simplicity of explanation. However, when null and alternative hypotheses manifest themselves in subtle differences in patterns in the data, binned analysis methods may be insensitive to these differences, and researchers may erroneously fail to reject the null hypothesis when in fact more sensitive statistical analysis methods might produce a different result when the null hypothesis is actually false. Here, with a focus on two recent conflicting studies of contagion in mass killings as instructive examples, we discuss how the use of unbinned likelihood methods makes optimal use of the information in the data; a fact that has been long known in statistical theory, but perhaps is not as widely appreciated amongst general researchers in the life and social sciences.In 2015, Towers et al published a paper that quantified the long-suspected contagion effect in mass killings. However, in 2017, Lankford & Tomek subsequently published a paper, based upon the same data, that claimed to contradict the results of the earlier study. The former used unbinned likelihood methods, and the latter used binned methods, and comparison of distribution moments. Using these analyses, we also discuss how visualization of the data can aid in determination of the most appropriate statistical analysis methods to distinguish between a null and alternate hypothesis. We also discuss the importance of assessment of the robustness of analysis results to methodological assumptions made (for example, arbitrary choices of number of bins and bin widths when using binned methods); an issue that is widely overlooked in the literature, but is critical to analysis reproducibility and robustness.When an analysis cannot distinguish between a null and alternate hypothesis, care must be taken to ensure that the analysis methodology itself maximizes the use of information in the data that can distinguish between the two hypotheses. The use of binned methods by Lankford & Tomek (2017), that examined how many mass killings fell within a 14 day window from a previous mass killing, substantially reduced the sensitivity of their analysis to contagion effects. The unbinned likelihood methods used by Towers et al (2015) did not suffer from this problem. While a binned analysis might be favorable for simplicity and clarity of presentation, unbinned likelihood methods are preferable when effects might be somewhat subtle."

https://openalex.org/W2803062339,"Social and economic systems produce complex and nonlinear relationships in the indicator variables that describe them. We present a Bayesian methodology to analyze the dynamical relationships between indicator variables by identifying the nonlinear functions that best describe their interactions. We search for the ‘best’ explicit functions by fitting data using Bayesian linear regression on a vast number of models and then comparing their Bayes factors. The model with the highest Bayes factor, having the best trade-off between explanatory power and interpretability, is chosen as the ‘best’ model. To be able to compare a vast number of models, we use conjugate priors, resulting in fast computation times. We check the robustness of our approach by comparison with more prediction oriented approaches such as model averaging and neural networks. Our modelling approach is illustrated using the classical example of how democracy and economic growth relate to each other. We find that the best dynamical model for democracy suggests that long term democratic increase is only possible if the economic situation gets better. No robust model explaining economic development using these two variables was found."
