https://openalex.org/W1987380844,"The pim-1 oncogene encodes a serine/threonine kinase (Pim-1) involved in the transduction of cytokine-triggered mitogenic signals. Pim-1 is unique in that it closely cooperates with c-Myc not only in oncogenesis, but also in apoptosis induction. However, the molecular basis of Pim-1 function remains poorly understood, largely because the downstream effector molecule(s) for Pim-1 kinase has not been identified. Here we provide several lines of evidence that Cdc25A cell cycle phosphatase, a direct transcriptional target for c-Myc, is a substrate for Pim-1 kinase and functions as an effector for Pim-1. We found that Pim-1 physically interacts with Cdc25A both in vitro and in vivoand phosphorylates Cdc25A. We also observed that Pim-1-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc25A increases its phosphatase activity. In addition, wild-type Pim-1, but not kinase-inactive Pim-1, enhanced Cdc25A-mediated cellular transformation and apoptosis. Our results indicate that Cdc25A might be a key molecule that links Pim-1 and c-Myc and that also ties Pim-1-mediated mitogenic signals to cell cycle machinery.

The pim-1 oncogene was originally identified as a genetic locus frequently activated by the proviral insertion of Moloney murine leukemia virus into mouse T cell lymphomas (1Cuypers H.T. Selten G.

Thepim-1 oncogene has also been implicated in human hematopoietic malignancies, with its overexpression frequently detected in human hematopoietic cell lines as well as in fresh tumor cells from patients with leukemia (4Nagarajan L.

The pim-1 gene product (Pim-1), identified as a serine/threonine kinase (7Saris C.J.M. Domen J. Berns A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 8Padma R. Nagarajan L.

However, at present, the downstream signaling pathway for Pim-1 kinase leading to cell proliferation remains unknown. One of the unique properties of pim-1 as an oncogene is its close cooperation with c-myc in oncogenesis (20van Lohuizen M. Verbeek S. Krimpenfort P. Domen J. Saris C. Radaszkiewicz T. Berns A. Cell. 1989; 56: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 21Breuer M. Slebos R. Verbeek S. van Lohuizen M. Wientjens E. Berns A.

Biol. 1991; 11: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Although transgenic mice expressing pim-1 under the control of the immunoglobulin Eμ enhancer have been shown to develop lymphomas spontaneously, the appearance of monoclonal lymphomas at a low incidence and with a long latency period suggests the requirement of additional genetic changes for lymphomagenesis (20van Lohuizen M. Verbeek S. Krimpenfort P. Domen J. Saris C. Radaszkiewicz T. Berns A. Cell. 1989; 56: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Indeed, treatment with chemical carcinogens or infection with Moloney murine leukemia virus significantly facilitated lymphomagenesis in Eμ-pim-1 mice, and it was also revealed that most of the lymphomas developing in Eμ-pim-1 transgenic mice have a concomitant overexpression of the c-myc oncogene, suggesting the strong dependence of pim-1 on the deregulated expression of c-myc (20van Lohuizen M. Verbeek S. Krimpenfort P. Domen J. Saris C. Radaszkiewicz T. Berns A. Cell. 1989; 56: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In support of this observation, Verbeeket al. (22Verbeek S. van Lohuizen M. van der Valk M. Domen J. Kraal G. Berns A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the coexpression ofpim-1 and c-myc by crosses of Eμ-pim-1 and Eμ-myc mice causes the accelerated development of leukemias in utero. Although the mechanism underlying this strong synergistic oncogenesis betweenpim-1 and c-myc remains unclear, it has been proposed that Pim-1 may contribute to transformation by inhibiting apoptosis, similarly to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 oncoprotein, becausepim-1 expression rescues both lymph node cells from rapid apoptosis in vitro and CD4+/CD8+double-positive thymocytes from dexamethasone-induced apoptosisin vivo in Eμ-pim-1 lpr/lpr mice (23Möröy T. Grzeschiczek A. Petzold S. Hartmann K.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10734-10738Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). c-Myc oncoprotein has been shown to trigger intracellular signals leading to both transformation and apoptosis (24Henriksson M. Lüscher B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the selective inhibition of the apoptotic signaling pathway by Bcl-2 has been suggested as a basis for the observed synergy between c-mycand bcl-2 in lymphomagenesis in transgenic mice (25Strasser A. Harris A.W. Bath M.L. Suzanne C. Nature. 1990; 348: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 26Fanidi A. Harrington E.A. Evan G.I.

We therefore examined in a previous study whether pim-1cooperates with c-myc in oncogenesis through the inhibition of c-Myc-mediated apoptosis (28Mochizuki T. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Sugiyama A. Kagaya S. Chi S. Asai A. Kuchino Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1471-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using a well established system for c-Myc-mediated apoptosis in which deregulated c-Myc expression causes the apoptosis of rat fibroblasts deprived of serum growth factors (29Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancok D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2773) Google Scholar). However, quite unexpectedly, the expression of Pim-1 kinase enhanced the c-Myc-mediated apoptosis in serum-deprived Rat-1 fibroblasts (28Mochizuki T. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Sugiyama A. Kagaya S. Chi S. Asai A. Kuchino Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1471-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which was in sharp contrast to the inhibitory activity of Bcl-2 against c-Myc-mediated apoptosis (26Fanidi A. Harrington E.A. Evan G.I. Nature. 1992; 359: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 27Bissonnette R.P. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Nature. 1992; 359: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Pim-1 expression alone did not cause apoptosis even in the absence of serum growth factors, indicating that Pim-1 kinase requires deregulated c-Myc expression for its apoptosis-promoting activity (28Mochizuki T. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Sugiyama A. Kagaya S. Chi S. Asai A. Kuchino Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1471-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, accumulating evidence now suggests that, in both cellular transformation and apoptosis induction, Pim-1 is dependent on and cooperates with deregulated c-Myc expression, and this gives rise to an intriguing possibility that Pim-1 kinase may function through the modulation of c-Myc-triggered intracellular signaling common to transformation and apoptosis. Therefore, in this study, we examined this possibility by exploring the target molecules for Pim-1 kinase, and we found that Cdc25A cell cycle phosphatase can function as a substrate and effector molecule for Pim-1 kinase. Based on the results, we suggest that Cdc25A, a direct transcriptional target of c-Myc implicated in both transformation and apoptosis induction, may act as a key molecule on which intracellular signals from c-Myc and Pim-1 converge. pcDNA3Cdc25A was created by subcloning ratcdc25AcDNA (30Jinno S. Suto K. Nagata A. Igarashi M. Kanaoka Y. Nojima H. Okayama H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1549-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) containing the entire coding region into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). pFLAG-Pim-1 and pFLAG-Pim-1K67M were created by subcloning the entire coding region of pim-1 cDNA from pcDNA3pim-1 and pcDNA3pim-1K67M (28Mochizuki T. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Sugiyama A. Kagaya S. Chi S. Asai A. Kuchino Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1471-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), respectively, into the pFLAG-CMV-2 expression vector (Eastman Kodak Co.). GST 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathioneS-transferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; IL, interleukin.-Pim-1 and GST-Pim-1K67M were created by subcloning the entire coding region from pcDNA3pim-1 and pcDNA3pim-1K67M, respectively, in frame to the GST coding sequence of the pGEX2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-Pim-1 deletion mutants (amino acids 1–228, 1–96, 1–40, and 230–313) were similarly created by subcloning theEcoRI-BamHI, EcoRI-SacI,EcoRI-ApaI, and BamHI-EcoRI fragments of pcDNA3pim-1, respectively, into pGEX2T. GST-Cdc25A and GST-c-Myc-(1–262) were created by subcloning the entire coding region of rat cdc25AcDNA and the human c-myc cDNA fragment from the initiator ATG codon to the ClaI site, respectively, in-frame to GST of the pGEX2T vector. The affinity purification of the GST fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli (JM109) was done essentially as described previously (31Kagaya S. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Mochizuki T. Sugiyama A. Asai A. Yasuhara N. Eguchi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Kuchino Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6736-6745Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Rat-1 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (DMEM/FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. To obtain Rat-1 cells constitutively overexpressing Cdc25A, Rat-1 cells were transfected with pcDNA3Cdc25A and selected with Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable Rat-1 transfectants expressing transfected Cdc25A (Rat-1/Cdc25A) were identified by a Northern blot analysis using rat cdc25AcDNA as a probe essentially as described previously (32Kitanaka C. Sugiyama A. Kanazu S. Miyagi Y. Mishima K. Asai A. Kuchino Y. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 123-132PubMed Google Scholar). Rat-1/Cdc25A cells were further transfected with pFLAG-Pim-1 together with pCEP4 (carrying the hygromycin resistance gene) and selected with hygromycin B (Calbiochem). Stable transfectants thus obtained were examined for FLAG-tagged Pim-1 (FLAG-Pim-1) expression by immunoblot analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody (M5, Kodak), and clones expressing and not expressing FLAG-Pim-1 were designated Rat-1/Cdc25A/FLAG-Pim-1(+) and Rat-1/Cdc25A/FLAG-Pim-1(−), respectively. Rat-1/Cdc25A/FLAG-Pim-1K67M cells expressing FLAG-tagged, kinase-inactive Pim-1 were similarly obtained by transfecting Rat-1/Cdc25A cells with pFLAG-Pim-1K67M and pCEP4, followed by hygromycin B selection and immunoblot analysis. Serum deprivation and the counting of apoptotic cells were done as described previously (28Mochizuki T. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Sugiyama A. Kagaya S. Chi S. Asai A. Kuchino Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1471-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To induce apoptosis in Rat-1 transfectants, cells were seeded 24 h before serum deprivation and then transferred to medium containing 0.1% FBS. Apoptotic cells were identified by their loss of adherence and typical nuclear changes (definite chromatin condensation and/or nuclear fragmentation). For detection of apoptotic nuclear changes, non-adherent cells were incubated in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml acridine orange (Sigma) and observed under a fluorescence microscope. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined as 100 × (number of apoptotic cells/total cell count). For the soft agar colony formation assay, a total of 1 × 105 cells suspended in DMEM/FBS were mixed with an equal volume of DMEM/FBS containing 0.8% agarose (final 0.4% agarose) and poured onto a bed of DMEM/FBS containing 0.53% agarose in a 60-mm dish. After 1 week, photomicrographs were taken, and colonies were counted in three randomly selected visual fields (magnification × 100). In both the apoptosis and soft agar colony formation assays, multiple clones for each type of transfectant were examined, with essentially similar results. Therefore, the results of representative transfectants are presented. Rat-1 cells (5 × 105 cells seeded on the previous day) were labeled with 100 μCi of Tran35S-label (ICN) in DMEM lacking Met and Cys and supplemented with dialyzed FBS for 8 h. Labeled or unlabeled Rat-1 cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and the supernatants were recovered as cell lysates after centrifugation. Forin vitro binding assays, cell lysates (0.5 ml) were incubated with GST fusion proteins (100 μg) recovered on glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 2 h, and the beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then visualized by autoradiography for labeled proteins or were subjected to immunoblot analysis. For the in vivo binding assays, cell lysates (1 ml) precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads were incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody (M5), anti-Cdc25A rabbit polyclonal antibody (antibody 144, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 4 h and subsequently with protein G-Sepharose beads for 2 h. The protein-antibody complex recovered on the beads was subjected to immunoblot analysis after separation by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analysis using the anti-Cdc25A antibody (antibody 144) was done under the conditions previously described (28Mochizuki T. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Sugiyama A. Kagaya S. Chi S. Asai A. Kuchino Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1471-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis using the anti-FLAG antibody (M5) was done as recommended by the manufacturer. Kinase reactions were done essentially as described by Friedmann et al. (33Friedmann M. Nissen M.S. Hoover D.S. Reeves R. Magnuson N.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out in a 30-μl volume containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm ATP, 0.25 μg of affinity-purified GST-Pim-1 or GST-Pim-1K67M, and 10 μg of histone H1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or affinity-purified GST fusion proteins. The reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP. The samples were incubated at 22 °C for 30 min and then terminated by the addition of 30 μl of 2× sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue). One-half of each sample (30 μl) was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Affinity-purified GST-Cdc25A protein (15 μg) was incubated with 40 μl of glutathione-Sepharose slurry (1:1) at 4 °C for 2 h. After being washed three times with kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), the beads were suspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing affinity-purified GST-Pim-1 (20 μg) and 10 μm ATP (unless indicated otherwise), and the kinase reaction was carried out at 22 °C for 30 min. The kinase reaction was terminated by washing the beads three times with phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol). The beads were then suspended in 500 μl of phosphatase buffer containing 50 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. After terminating the phosphatase reaction by the addition of 10 μl of 10 m NaOH, the phosphatase activity was assayed by measuring A 410 nm. Our previous results suggested that Pim-1 kinase stimulates c-Myc-mediated apoptosis in serum-deprived Rat-1 fibroblasts through the phosphorylation of its target molecule(s) (28Mochizuki T. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Sugiyama A. Kagaya S. Chi S. Asai A. Kuchino Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1471-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As one of the approaches to identify such a target(s) for Pim-1 kinase that might be involved in the intracellular signaling triggered by c-Myc, we searched for cellular proteins that are associated with Pim-1. A GST fusion protein containing full-length Pim-1 (GST-Pim-1) was bacterially expressed, purified, and then used to screen binding proteins in the Rat-1 cell lysate. When GST and GST-Pim-1 were incubated with a cell lysate prepared from metabolically labeled Rat-1 cells, GST-Pim-1 bound several cellular proteins that did not bind to the control GST protein, suggesting the presence of cellular proteins that specifically bind to Pim-1 (Fig. 1 A). Among these proteins, we were particularly interested in the one with a molecular mass of ∼65 kDa (Fig. 1 A, arrow) since a previous study also demonstrated the presence of an ∼68-kDa phosphorylated protein complexed with Pim-1 in a Pim-1 immunocomplex kinase assay (8Padma R. Nagarajan L. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2486-2489PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of Pim-1 to cooperate with c-Myc in both cellular transformation and apoptosis induction suggested the possibility that Pim-1 interacts with a molecule(s) regulating the common proximal signaling pathway required for both c-Myc-mediated cellular transformation and apoptosis induction (28Mochizuki T. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Sugiyama A. Kagaya S. Chi S. Asai A. Kuchino Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1471-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that the ∼65-kDa protein might be c-Myc itself or its direct transcriptional target Cdc25A cell cycle phosphatase (34Galaktionov K. Chen X. Beach D. Nature. 1996; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), both of which have a similar molecular mass of ∼65 kDa. To test this possibility, we immunoblotted, with specific antibodies against c-Myc and Cdc25A, the proteins bound to GST-Pim-1 after incubation with the Rat-1 cell lysate. Although c-Myc was not found in the proteins bound to GST-Pim-1 in this in vitro binding assay (data not shown), a specific band was reproducibly detected around 65 kDa when immunoblotting was done using the anti-Cdc25A antibody (Fig.1 B). These results demonstrated that Pim-1 binds Cdc25A cell cycle phosphatase in this assay system. Using this in vitro binding assay, we then determined which region of Pim-1 is responsible for the specific interaction with Cdc25A. We constructed deletion mutants of Pim-1 fused to GST (Fig. 2,A and B), and after incubating these GST-Pim-1 mutants with the Rat-1 cell lysate, we immunoblotted the bound proteins with the anti-Cdc25A antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 C, Cdc25A preferentially bound to the N-terminal region of Pim-1 (GST-Pim-1-(1–228); lane 3), but not to its C-terminal region (GST-Pim-1-(230–313); lane 6). Although GST-Pim-1-(1–96) still bound Cdc25A efficiently (Fig.2 C, lane 4), GST-Pim-1-(1–40) failed to do so (lane 5). These results indicated that the N-terminal 96 residues of Pim-1 are necessary and sufficient for the interaction with Cdc25A. We next examined whether the association of Pim-1 and Cdc25A observed in the in vitro binding assay is also relevant in vivo. Cell lysates were prepared from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with either a plasmid vector expressing FLAG-Pim-1 or a control empty vector (FLAG), and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed using these lysates. As shown in Fig.3 A, the anti-FLAG antibody coprecipitated endogenous Cdc25A together with FLAG-Pim-1, but not with the FLAG tag alone. Conversely, the anti-Cdc25A antibody, but not control rabbit IgG, coprecipitated FLAG-Pim-1 together with Cdc25A (Fig. 3 B). Thus, Pim-1 and Cdc25A form a stable complexin vivo as well as in vitro. Given the physical interaction between Pim-1 and Cdc25A, we next investigated whether Cdc25A serves as a substrate for Pim-1 kinase. As shown in Fig. 4 A, GST-Pim-1 phosphorylated GST-Cdc25A (lane 4) as efficiently as it phosphorylated histone H1 (lane 1), one of the best substrates for Pim-1 kinase known to date (9Hoover D. Friedmann M. Reeves R. Magnuson N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14018-14023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Friedmann M. Nissen M.S. Hoover D.S. Reeves R. Magnuson N.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast, GST-Pim-1 phosphorylated neither the control GST protein (Fig.4 A, lane 3) nor an irrelevant protein, the N-terminal 262 residues of human c-Myc fused to GST (lane 6) under these assay conditions, indicating that the phosphorylation of Cdc25A by Pim-1 is not a nonspecific event. The phosphorylation of Cdc25A was strictly dependent on the intrinsic kinase activity of Pim-1 because the kinase-inactive mutant of Pim-1 (Pim-1K67M), in which Lys-67 (essential for ATP binding) is mutated to Met (8Padma R. Nagarajan L. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2486-2489PubMed Google Scholar, 33Friedmann M. Nissen M.S. Hoover D.S. Reeves R. Magnuson N.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), failed to phosphorylate Cdc25A (Fig. 4 A, lane 5) as well as histone H1 (lane 2). Cdc25A phosphatase is thought to regulate cell cycle progression through the removal of phosphate groups from the conserved Thr-14 and Tyr-15 residues of cyclin-dependent kinases (30Jinno S. Suto K.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), and it has been demonstrated that the phosphatase activity of Cdc25A can be enhanced through phosphorylation by serine/threonine kinases such as Cdk2 and Raf-1 (35Hoffmann I. Draetta G. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 36Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1046-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of the Pim-1-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc25A on its phosphatase activity, we performed phosphatase assays using p-nitrophenyl phosphate, a chromogenic molecule that is structurally related to phosphotyrosine (37Dunphy W.G. Kumagai A. Cell. 1991; 67: 189-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 38Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 67: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 4 B, GST-Cdc25A, which was bacterially expressed and purified, had a basal phosphatase activity, dephosphorylating p-nitrophenyl phosphate in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the control GST protein had no such activity. We then analyzed the phosphatase activity of GST-Cdc25A after preincubation with GST fusion proteins including GST-Pim-1 under the kinase reaction conditions. The phosphatase activity of GST-Cdc25A increased from the basal level (Fig.4 C, bar 1) after preincubation with GST-Pim-1 (bar 5), but not with GST alone (bar 3), suggesting that Pim-1 activates Cdc25A. The activation of Cdc25A by Pim-1 was apparently dependent on phosphorylation by Pim-1 kinase since Pim-1 failed to activate Cdc25A significantly in the absence of ATP (Fig. 4 C, bar 6), and the kinase-inactive Pim-1K67M mutant also failed to activate Cdc25A even in the presence of ATP (lane 7). Taken together, these results indicate that Pim-1 kinase activates the phosphatase activity of Cdc25A through its phosphorylation. The finding that Pim-1 kinase is capable of phosphorylating and activating Cdc25A phosphatase in vitro, together with the observation that Pim-1 forms a stable complex with Cdc25A in vivo, strongly suggested the possibility that Pim-1 kinase modulates the biological functions of Cdc25A in living cells. To test this possibility, we first examined the effect of Pim-1 overexpression on the Cdc25A-mediated apoptosis of serum-deprived fibroblasts. Consistent with a previous report (34Galaktionov K. Chen X. Beach D. Nature. 1996; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), the overexpression of exogenously introduced Cdc25A (Rat-1/Cdc25A; Fig.5 A, lane 2) efficiently induced apoptotic cell death in Rat-1 fibroblasts deprived of serum survival factors (Fig. 5, B and C). The concomitant overexpression of Pim-1 together with Cdc25A (Rat-1/Cdc25A/FLAG-Pim-1(+); Fig. 5 A, lane 3) further stimulated the serum deprivation-induced apoptosis compared with the overexpression of Cdc25A alone (Rat-1/Cdc25A; Fig. 5,B and C), suggesting that Pim-1 is capable of enhancing Cdc25A-mediated apoptosis. The enhancement of Cdc25A-mediated apoptosis was actually dependent on the expression of Pim-1 and its intrinsic kinase activity since both Rat-1/Cdc25A/FLAG-Pim-1(−) cells, which do not overexpress Pim-1 despite transfection of the Pim-1 expression vector (Fig. 5 A, lane 4), and Rat-1/Cdc25A/FLAG-Pim-1K67M cells, which overexpress kinase-inactive Pim-1 together with Cdc25A (lane 5), underwent apoptosis no more efficiently than did Rat-1/Cdc25A cells deprived of serum survival factors (B and C). Together, these results demonstrate that Pim-1 kinase enhances the ability of Cdc25A to induce apoptosis. In addition to its role in apoptosis regulation, the perturbation of cell cycle control as a result of deregulated Cdc25A expression has been implicated in oncogenesis. For instance, Cdc25A is frequently overexpressed in human breast and gastric cancers and has been shown to cooperate with either oncogenic Ha-Ras or a loss of RB1 in oncogenic transformation (39Galaktionov K. Lee A.K. Eckstein J. Draetta G. Meckler J. Loda M. Beach D. Science. 1995; 269: 1575-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 40Kudo Y. Yasui W. Ue T. Yamamoto S. Yokozaki H. Nikai H.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2366-2368PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether Pim-1 enhances the oncogenic potential of Cdc25A. The stable Rat-1 transfectants used for the apoptosis assay were examined for the transformed phenotype of anchorage-independent growth in the presence of serum survival factors. As shown in Fig.6 (A and B), the overexpression of either Cdc25A (Rat-1/Cdc25A) or Pim-1 (Rat-1/Pim-1) alone only marginally stimulated the colony formation of Rat-1 fibroblasts in soft agar. However, colony formation was substantially facilitated by the concomitant overexpression of Cdc25A and Pim-1 (Rat-1/Cdc25A/FLAG-Pim-1(+); Fig. 6, A and B). As was the case with the apoptosis assay, the enhanced colony formation required both the overexpression of Pim-1 and its kinase activity (Rat-1/Cdc25A/FLAG-Pim-1(−) and Rat-1/Cdc25A/FLAG-Pim-1K67M; Fig. 6,A and B). Notably, although the Rat-1/Cdc25A/FLAG-Pim-1(+) cells that overexpress Cdc25A and Pim-1 were capable of forming colonies in soft agar, they did not form foci under normal culture conditions. 2T. Mochizuki, unpublished observation.This may indicate that higher expression levels of Pim-1 and Cdc25A or additional oncogenes or loss of tumor suppressor genes is required for a fully transformed phenotype. Nevertheless, the results clearly indicate that Pim-1 kinase enhances the transforming potential as well as the apoptosis-inducing ability of Cdc25A. In this study, we showed that Pim-1 kinase physically interacts with Cdc25A and increases its phosphatase activity through phosphorylation. We also showed that Pim-1 kinase enhances the biological activities of Cdc25A, including apoptosis induction. Cdc25A has been identified as a direct transcriptional target for the c-Myc transcription factor, and it has also been demonstrated that the deregulated expression of Cdc25A is required for the induction of c-Myc-mediated apoptosis in rodent fibroblasts (34Galaktionov K. Chen X. Beach D. Nature. 1996; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In addition to these findings, we previously reported that Pim-1 expression can stimulate the apoptotic signaling pathway elicited by c-Myc in Rat-1 fibroblasts depending on its kinase activity (28Mochizuki T. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Sugiyama A. Kagaya S. Chi S. Asai A. Kuchino Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1471-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that Pim-1 kinase activates the c-Myc-mediated apoptotic signaling through the direct activation of Cdc25A up-regulated by c-Myc. Our present results suggested that Pim-1 behaves as a proapoptotic molecule in the c-Myc- and Cdc25A-mediated apoptosis of serum-deprived Rat-1 cells. However, it seems that the effect of Pim-1 on apoptosis depends on the cell type. For instance, Pim-1 has been implicated in the apoptosis induction of a murine myeloma cell line (42Takahashi C. Harada Y. Ariga H. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), whereas Pim-1 has been shown to function as an antiapoptotic factor in lymphocytes from lpr/lpr mice (23Möröy T. Grzeschiczek A. Petzold S. Hartmann K.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10734-10738Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and in a murine myeloid precursor cell line (43Lilly M. Kraft A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5348-5355PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the role of c-Myc-mediated signaling in apoptosis regulation appears to be different depending on the cell type. Indeed, in the interleukin (IL)-3-dependent pro-B cell line Ba/F3, c-Myc overexpression rescues cells from the IL-3 deprivation-induced apoptosis associated with a decrease in c-Myc expression, demonstrating that c-Myc functions as a survival factor rather than as an apoptosis inducer under this condition (44Gotoh N. Tojo A. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6197-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). On the other hand, c-Myc overexpression facilitates the IL-3 deprivation-induced apoptosis of the myeloid cell line 32D (45Askew D.S. Ashmun R.A. Simmons B.C. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922PubMed Google Scholar). From these observations, we propose that Pim-1 may be simply stimulating the c-Myc-mediated signaling pathway in every case, and the net effect of Pim-1 expression on apoptosis may be dependent on whether c-Myc acts proapoptotically or antiapoptotically in a given cell type. However, it is also possible that Pim-1 kinase has multiple target molecules, including Cdc25A, some of which are implicated in apoptosis induction and others in apoptosis inhibition. If so, the further identification of the target molecules of Pim-1 should provide more insights into the versatile apoptosis regulation by Pim-1. At present, the precise mechanism underlying Pim-1-mediated cellular transformation remains unknown. Although it has been proposed based on the antiapoptotic activity of Pim-1 kinase that Pim-1 contributes to transformation by inhibiting apoptosis (23Möröy T. Grzeschiczek A. Petzold S. Hartmann K.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10734-10738Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that the inhibition of apoptosis is the sole mechanism. First, pim-1has been shown to effectively cooperate with bcl-2, a representative antiapoptotic oncogene, in lymphomagenesis (46Acton D. Domen J. Jacobs H. Vlaar M. Korsmeyer S. Berns A. Peter M. Melchers M. Mechanisms in B-Cell Neoplasia. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 293-298Google Scholar, 47Shinto Y. Morimoto M. Katsumata M. Uchida A. Aozasa K. Okamoto M. Kurosawa T. Ochi T. Greene M.I. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1729-1736PubMed Google Scholar). Second, gfi-1, identified through the proviral tagging approach as a gene whose overexpression can further facilitate lymphomagenesis in myc/pim-1 bitransgenic mice, has been shown to function as an apoptosis inhibitor through the transcriptional repression of proapoptotic members of thebcl-2 gene family such as bax and bak(48Zörnig M. Schmidt T. Karsunky H. Grzeschiczek A. Möröy T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1789-1801PubMed Google Scholar, 49Grimes H.L. Gilks C.B. Chan T.O. Porter S. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14569-14573Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). If Pim-1 is functioning solely as an apoptosis inhibitor, these combinations should be redundant rather than cooperative. In this regard, our present results give rise to an attractive hypothetical model in which Pim-1 contributes to cellular transformation through the activation of Cdc25A cell cycle phosphatase, which has recently been reported to be overexpressed in human aggressive lymphomas overexpressing c-myc (50Hernandez S. Hernandez L. Bea S. Cazorla M. Fernandez P.L. Nadal A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1762-1767PubMed Google Scholar). Although the role of Cdc25A in lymphomagenesis is yet to be demonstrated, deregulated Cdc25A expression may well be oncogenic to hematopoietic cells, given its critical role in cell cycle progression (30Jinno S. Suto K. Nagata A. Igarashi M. Kanaoka Y. Nojima H. Okayama H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1549-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 35Hoffmann I. Draetta G. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and its well documented oncogenic potential in fibroblasts (39Galaktionov K. Lee A.K. Eckstein J. Draetta G. Meckler J. Loda M. Beach D. Science. 1995; 269: 1575-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). More important, this model can provide a clear explanation for the close cooperation between pim-1 and c-myc in lymphomagenesis, one of the most characteristic features of the pim-1 oncogene. It would therefore be of interest to investigate whether Cdc25A has a role and can cooperate with Pim-1 in lymphomagenesis. Aside from its function as an oncoprotein, Pim-1 kinase also plays a crucial role in mediating the mitogenic signals from cytokines such as IL-3 and IL-7 in hematopoietic cells (10Dautry F. Weil D. Yu J. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17615-17620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lilly M. Le T. Holland P. Hendrickson S.L.

Blood. 1993; 82: 1445-1452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, how the mitogenic signals lead to stimulated cell proliferation remains unknown. Cdc25A cell cycle phosphatase has been shown to act as a critical regulator of cell cycle transition from G1 to S (30Jinno S. Suto K. Nagata A. Igarashi M. Kanaoka Y. Nojima H. Okayama H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1549-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 35Hoffmann I. Draetta G. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), and its phosphatase activity is regulated by phosphorylation, as shown in this study as well as in others (35Hoffmann I. Draetta G. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 36Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1046-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). It is therefore expected that mitogen-induced Pim-1 expression leads to the increased phosphorylation and activation of Cdc25A, which in turn stimulates cell proliferation by facilitating cell cycle progression. Thus, our identification of Cdc25A as an effector molecule for Pim-1 kinase provides a possible link between Pim-1-mediated mitogenic signaling and cell cycle progression. We thank Drs. Shigeki Jinno, Akihisa Nagata, and Hiroto Okayama for the generous gift of Cdc25A cDNA."

This hypersensitivity can be reversed by the expression of forms ofBRCA1 that are not growth suppressing. Reversal of hypersensitivity requires the ring finger of BRCA1, its transactivation domain, and its BRCT domain. Lastly, we show that unlike BRCA2, BRCA1 does not function in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. Instead, it functions in transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR). TCR ability correlated with radioresistance as cells containing BRCA1 showed both increased TCR and radioresistance, whereas cells withoutBRCA1 showed decreased TCR and radiosensitivity.

Unfortunately, BRCA1 −/− mice die at day 6.5 to day 8.5 of embryonic gestation because of lack of proliferation of the mouse blastocyst (10Gowen L.C. Johnson B.L. Latour A.M. Sulik K.K. Koller B.H.

First, whenBRCA1 −/− mice are mated with p53−/− mice to generate BRCA1 −/−p53−/− mice, these double-knock out mice show reduced embryonic lethality (13Hakem R. de la Pomba J.L. Elia A. Potter J.

Despite these suggestive findings in the mouse system, there are such large differences in mouse and human BRCA1 biology that it is unclear whether the DNA repair function of mouse BRCA1 is applicable to human BRCA1.

When coupled with the finding that BRCA1 −/− mouse cells are deficient in TCR, all these findings suggest a role for BRCA1 in the cellular response to DNA damage. To determine the role of BRCA1 in the cellular response to DNA damage, we have developed a human genetic system. HCC1937 is a human breast cancer cell line originally established from a family carrying a known cancer-causing BRCA1 mutation, 5283insC. We show that: 1) HCC1937 cells are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation; 2) replacement of critical regions of BRCA1 can reverse this radiation sensitivity; and 3) TCR correlates with radioresistance as cells containing BRCA1 show both increased TCR and radioresistance. HCC 1937 cells were grown in RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5 mm glutamine, 1× antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma), 1× ITSA (Sigma), and 5% fetal bovine serum (Summit). HCC1937 cells were transfected with 1 μg of DNA using Cellfectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Using β-galactosidase, we determined an average transfection efficiency of 20%. XRV15B cells were a gift of Gilbert Chu (Stanford University). These were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 mm glutamine, and 1× antibiotic/antimycotic. V8 cells are a cell line generated by our lab from a breast cancer patient who carries an exon 11BRCA1 mutation (R1203X). These cells are heterozygous for this mutation (data not shown). MCF-7 cells (hemizygous wild-typeBRCA1), HBL100 cells and Capan-1 cells (hemizygous mutantBRCA2) were obtained from American Type Tissue Collection and grown as instructed. Two types of cell survival assays were used: the colony forming assay and the transient transfection cell survival assay. The colony forming assay was performed as described previously (36Abbott D.W. Holt J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14005-14008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The transient transfection cell survival (34Chen P.L. Chen C.F. Chen Y. Xiao J. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5287-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) assay was performed as described with the following changes. Approximately 1 × 106 HCC1937 cells were transfected at 85% confluency with 1 μg of indicated plasmid and Cellfectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). 18 h later, the plates of cells were exposed to the various doses of ionizing radiation. Cells were then refed every 2–3 days. 8 days following irradiation (10 days following transfection), the cells were trypsinized, and the total cell number was determined by Coulter Counter. Relative survival refers to the cell number from a given transfection at a given dose compared with the cell number from an unirradiated plate of the same transfected cells plated on the same day and grown for the same length of time. The pMT vector was a gift from Frank Rauscher (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA). This vector contains a Zn2+-inducible promoter and the neomycin resistance gene. Full-length BRCA1 was cloned into this vector via theNotI and HindIII sites. The Δ702–834 deletion was generated by digestion of full-length pMT-BRCA1 withHpaI followed by religation. Δ3–29 was constructed by digestion of pMT-BRCA1 with NotI andBclI and then ligated insertion of the following forward (F) and reverse (R) linkers: F, 5′-GGCCGCGAATTCGAAATGGATTT-3′, and R: 5′-GATCAAATCCATTTCGAATTCGC-3′. Δ3–471 was constructed by digestion with NotI and AflII and then ligated insertion of F, 5′-GGCCGCGAAATGGATAAC-3′, and R, 5′-TTAAGTTATCCATTTCGC. Δ512–1284 was constructed by digestion with EcoNI and then ligated insertion of F, 5′-ATCAGGCCTTA-3′, and R, 5′-CTAAGGCCTGA-3′. Δ922–1664 was constructed by digestion with BsrGI and then ligated insertion of F, 5′-GTACAGCTGGT-3′, and R, GTACACCAGCT-3′. Δ1293–1864 was constructed by digestion with NheI and then ligated insertion of a stop linker F, 5′-CTAGCCTCTAGATAG-3′, and R, 5′-CTAGCTATCTAGAGG-3′. Stably transfected cells were generated by transfecting 1 μg of pMT-BRCA1Δ702–834 into HCC1937 cells. Cells were then selected in 50 μg/ml G418 (Sigma) for 4 weeks. Approximately 20 individual colonies were selected and analyzed forBRCA1Δ702–834 expression by Western blotting. Briefly, total cell lysates were prepared. 20 μg of total protein was electrophoresed on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The electrophoresed protein was then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blotted using the indicated antibodies (1:1000 dilution). After appropriate washing and exposure to the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, BRCA1Δ702–834 was visualized using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This assay was performed as described previously (7Abbott D.W. Freeman M.L. Holt J.T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 978-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly 1 × 105 cells (XRV15B, HCC1937, or HCC1937BRCA1D702–834; clone 1) were embedded into agarose plugs under isotonic conditions. The cell plugs were then irradiated at 4 °C with 10 Gy ionizing radiation and placed into complete medium at 37 °C to perform double-stranded break repair for the given amount of time. After the given amount of repair time, the cell plugs were digested overnight at 55 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 50 mm EDTA, and 2 μg/ml proteinase K (Life Technologies, Inc.). The digested cell plugs were then embedded into a 0.7% agarose gel and subjected to pulsed field gel electrophoresis (3 V/cm, 45-s pulse time) for 72 h. The separated DNA was then transferred to a Gene-Screen filter, and Southern blotting was performed. The probe was generated by isolation of total genomic DNA from the given cell line followed by Random Prime labeling using [α-32P]ATP (Prime-It II, Stratagene). 1 × 107 HCC1937 cells or 1 × 107 BRCA1Δ702–834 (clone 1) cells for each time point were incubated in complete medium supplemented with 10 μmbromodeoxyuridine (Sigma) and 25 μCi of [3H]thymidine immediately prior to irradiation with 10 Gy. The zero time point was iced immediately. Remaining samples were incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C. Cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and DNA purification was performed by standard methods (proteinase K, phenol/chloroform/ethanol precipitation). The DNA was then digested with KpnI, repurified by phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitation, and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin with an antibody directed against bromodeoxyuridine (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Following this incubation, 10 μl of goat anti-mouse antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added incubated by 4 h and then collected by microcentrifugation for 15 min. Unbound DNA diluted 1:5 with TE and used directly for Southern blotting experiments. Aliquots of both the bound and unbound DNA fractions were scintillation counted to determine the total amount of repaired DNA. Both bound and unbound DNA samples from each time point were then electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, blotted to nylon membrane, and probed with strand-specific probes for the human DHFRgene. To generate strand-specific probes for transcribed regions of the human DHFR genes, Bluescript II (Stratagene) was digested with HindIII and BamHI. The following oligonucleotide linker from the DHFR gene was then inserted into Bluescript II (F, 5′-AGCTTCAGAGAACTCAAGTAAGTACCTTAACATAAATTCACCACAAG-3′, and R, 5′-GATCCTTGTGGTGAATTTATGTTAAGGTACTTACTTGAGTTCTCTGA-3′ (43Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). After construction, this plasmid containing DHFR plus the linker was digested with either HindIII or BamHI and transcribed with T3 polymerase or T7 polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]GTP to generate strand-specific probes. To study the role of BRCA1 in the cellular response to DNA damage, we have utilized a human breast cancer cell line (HCC1937) that contains only a mutated BRCA1 (35Tomlinson G.E. Chen T.T. Stastny V.A. Virmani A.K. Spillman M.A. Tonk V. Blum J.L. Schneider N.R. Wistuba I.I. Shay J.W. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3237-3242PubMed Google Scholar). The functional allele in these cells contains a frameshift mutation that deletes the BRCT domain of BRCA1. To determine whether cells lacking functional BRCA1 are sensitive to ionizing radiation, we performed colony forming assays (36Abbott D.W. Holt J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14005-14008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In comparison with MCF-7 cells, V8 cells and HBL100 cells, HCC1937 cells were significantly more radiation-sensitive. HCC1937 cells were approximately 2 logs more sensitive to ionizing radiation than HBL100 cells at 6 Gy and were approximately 30 to 40 times more sensitive than either V8 or MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1). Radiation sensitivity seemed to correlate with the genetic status of BRCA1. Cells with two copies of wt BRCA1 (HBL100) were more resistant than cells with one copy of wt BRCA1 (MCF-7), which were more resistant than cells without wt BRCA1 (HCC1937). Survival curves were generated on the XRV15B Ku86-deficient cell line (37Errami A. Smider V. Rathmell W.K. He D.M. Hendrickson E.A. Zdzienicka M.Z. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and the BRCA2-deficient Capan-1 cell line, and these survival curves were nearly identical to that of the HCC1937 cell line (Fig. 1). Because only a handful of cell lines have been shown to be as radiation-sensitive as the XRV15B cell line (38Hendrickson E.A. Qin X.Q. Bump E.A. Schatz D.G. Oettinger M. Weaver D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4061-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), this finding indicates that the sensitivity of the HCC1937 cell line is likely to be a real effect. We used a recently described method to measure cell survival after transient transfection and irradiation (34Chen P.L. Chen C.F. Chen Y. Xiao J. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5287-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) to determine whether reintroduction of BRCA1 into the HCC1937 cells could reverse the radiation sensitivity of these cells. Surprisingly, we were unable to demonstrate that reintroduction of full-length BRCA1 into HCC1937 reverses radiosensitivity because this assay depends on the continued growth of the cells after transfection. Thus, becauseBRCA1 is such a potent suppressor of cell growth (16Thompson M.E. Jensen R.A. Obermiller P.S. Page D.L. Holt J.T. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 444-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 17Holt J.T. Thompson M.E. Szabo C. Robinson-Benion C. Arteaga C.L. King M.C. Jensen R.A. Nat.

Sekido Y. et al.Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1097-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), transfection of BRCA1 stops cell growth and does not allow us to accurately measure cell survival following irradiation. To overcome this problem, we constructed a variety of BRCA1deletion mutants and tested them for the ability to suppress growth in the HCC 1937 cells. Each of these mutants contains an intact nuclear localization signal (40Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32863-32868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 41Thakur S. Zhang H.B. Peng Y. Le H. Carroll B. Ward T. Yao J. Farid L.M. Couch F.J. Wilson R.B. Weber B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar); however, these mutants lack important functional regions of BRCA1 (Fig.2 A). Because bothBRCA1 and BRCA1Δ3–29 suppress cell growth, they cannot be scored in an assay requiring cell growth. All other mutants tested, however, destroyed the growth suppressive effect ofBRCA1 and could therefore be used in the cell growth and survival assay (Fig. 2). The HCC1937 cells contain an endogenousBRCA1 mutation that eliminates the BRCT domain but leaves the transactivation domain intact. Because the HCC1937 cells are radiation-sensitive, this indicates that the BRCT domain is necessary for radiation resistance. In this assay, a deletion mutant that destroyed the N-terminal Zn2+ finger domain plus additional N-terminal sequences (BRCA1Δ3–471) could not rescue radiation sensitivity (Fig. 2 B). Mutants that deleted both the BRCT domain and the transactivation domain (BRCA1Δ1293–1864) or the transactivation domain alone (BRCA1Δ922–1664) could not rescue radiation sensitivity (Fig. 2 B). These findings demonstrate that the Zn2+ finger, the transactivation domain and the BRCT domain are all necessary for radiation resistance. In contrast to these findings, two deletion mutants (BRCA1Δ702–834 andBRCA1Δ512–1284) were able to restore radiation resistance (Fig. 2 B). These two mutants can eliminate the role ofBRCA1 as a growth suppressor but can reverse radiation sensitivity, showing that these functions can be separated. Because BRCA1 interacts with both Rad51 and BRCA2(29Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 31Chen J. Silver D.P. Walpita D. Cantor S.B. Gazdar A.F. Tomlinson G. Couch F.J. Weber B.L. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Scully R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 317-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), two double-stranded DNA repair proteins, and because mouse cells lacking BRCA1 are deficient in TCR (15Gowen L.C. Avrutskaya A.V. Latour A.M. Koller B.H. Leadon S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), we were interested in determining both the double-stranded break repair capacity and the TCR capacity of the HCC1937 cells. To study the repair capacity of HCC1937 cells lacking BRCA1 and those containing a form of BRCA1 that reverses radiation sensitivity (BRCA1Δ702–834), stably transfected cell lines were generated. HCC1937 cells were transfected withBRCA1Δ702–834 on a vector also containing the neomycin resistance gene. After 4 weeks of selection in G418, approximately 20 colonies were selected and propagated. Of these 20 colonies, two colonies expressed high levels of BRCA1Δ702–834 as shown by Western blotting (clones 1 and 2; Fig. 3,A and B). The two antibodies used for Western blotting were Ab-D (42Ruffner H. Verma I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7138-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and I-20. These antibodies recognize the far C terminus of BRCA1. HCC1937 cells contain a mutant form of BRCA1 that lacks this epitope. BRCA1Δ702–834 restores this epitope; therefore, the two clones generated show expression of BRCA1Δ702–834 by Western blotting (Fig. 3 A, upper blot shows Ab-D, and bottom blot shows I-20). Because zinc is required in HCC cell medium, addition of Zn2+ gave little induction (Fig. 3 A). These two clones were then tested for radiation sensitivity in the colony forming assay. HCC1937 cells that contain only empty vector are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation, whereas those expressing BRCA1Δ702–834 are approximately 2 logs more radiation-resistant at the 6 Gy dose (Fig. 3, B andC). Thus by both transient and stable transfectionBRCA1Δ702–834 reverses the radiation sensitivity of the HCC1937 cells. The ability to generate HCC1937 cells containing stably transfectedBRCA1Δ702–834 allowed us to compare the DNA repair capabilities of parental HCC1937 cells and HCC1937 cells containingBRCA1Δ702–834. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was then performed with Southern blotting using total genomic DNA as a probe. Under the electrophoresis conditions chosen, damaged DNA runs as a discrete band below the undamaged or repaired DNA (7Abbott D.W. Freeman M.L. Holt J.T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 978-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this experiment, HCC1937 cells repaired most damaged DNA within 2 h (Fig. 3 D, upper panel). HCC1937BRCA1Δ702–834 cells also repaired most of the damaged DNA within 2 h (Fig. 3 D, bottom panel). These cells showed slightly faster repair than parental HCC1937 cells, but the difference is too small to account for the 2 log difference in radiation sensitivity between these two cell lines. We next analyze TCR in HCC cells, with and without BRCA1gene replacement. Mouse cells containing defective BRCA1have been shown to be deficient in TCR (15Gowen L.C. Avrutskaya A.V. Latour A.M. Koller B.H. Leadon S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). HCC1937 cells showed a marked inability to undergo TCR (Fig.4 A, upper panels). Although the nontranscribed strand shows the expected result (little repair of the nontranscribed strand), the transcribed strand also shows little repair (compare bound and free fractions at both 2 and 4 h of repair). In contrast, cells containing BRCA1Δ702–834 were able to undergo TCR. Within 2 h after exposure, a much greater proportion of DHFR is present in the bound fraction (Fig.4 A, lower panels). Cells containingBRCA1Δ702–834 undergo TCR approximately 15 times faster than cells lacking functional BRCA1 (Fig.4 B). We have shown that cells containing a mutant BRCA1 that is known to cause cancer in human patients are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation. This radiation sensitivity can be reversed by forms of BRCA1 that do not suppress growth but maintain the Zn2+ finger, the transcription activating domain, and the BRCT domain intact. Although BRCA1 does not affect double-stranded break repair, cells lacking BRCA1 are deficient in their ability to perform TCR. These findings suggest that the interaction of BRCA1 with the transcription machinery (RNA pol II, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH, and RNA helicase A) are physiologically important. This work also suggests functional differences between BRCA1 and BRCA2. WhereasBRCA1 predominantly affects TCR, cells lackingBRCA2 have been shown to be deficient in double-stranded break repair (5Sharan S.K. Morimatsu M. Albrecht U. Lim D.-S. Regel E. Dinh C. Sands A.

Further work can help to determine whether these differing DNA repair defects lead to the higher cancer penetrance seen in BRCA1 carriers, the higher incidence of male breast cancer seen in BRCA2 carriers, and the different histology seen in BRCA1 or BRCA2-defective tumors.

Here we report the identification of HHR23A, one of the human homologues of the yeast DNA repair protein Rad23, as an E6-independent target of E6AP. HHR23A binds E6AP and is ubiquitinated in vitro in an E6AP-dependent manner. Ubiquitinated forms of endogenous HHR23A are detectable in mammalian cells.

Although HHR23A is a stable protein in non-synchronized cells, its levels are regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, with specific degradation occurring during S phase. The S phase degradation of HHR23A could be blocked in vivo by dominant negative E6AP, providing direct evidence for the involvement of E6AP in the regulation of HHR23A. Consistent with a role of the HHR23 proteins in DNA repair, UV-induced DNA damage inhibited HHR23A degradation.

Ubiquitination of protein substrates is a multi-step process that involves the concerted action of at least three classes of enzymes as follows: ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes; E3, ubiquitin protein ligase; E6AP, E6-associated protein; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NER, nucleotide excision repair; WGE, wheat germ extracts; CMV, cytomegalovirus; WT, wild type; HPV, human papilloma virus; HA, hemagglutinin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; XP, Xeroderma pigmentosum; XPC, xeroderma pigmentosum group C. ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), and ubiquitin protein ligases (E3s) (3Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). Although the biochemical mechanisms of ubiquitin transfer within the enzymatic components of the pathway and its subsequent conjugation to target proteins is now understood in considerable detail, it is still unclear how specific proteins are recognized by the ubiquitin system as substrates. E1 first activates ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent reaction through the formation of ubiquitin adenylate, followed by a thiol ester bond between the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin and thiol group of a specific cysteine residue in E1. Ubiquitin is then transferred to a specific cysteine residue in one of several E2s (6Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). E2 enzymes, in turn, may transfer the ubiquitin either directly to a substrate or to E3 enzymes that finally catalyze the formation of an isopeptide bond between the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin and the ε-amino group of lysine residues on a target protein (3Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar, 7Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar, 8Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). A substrate may be multiply ubiquitinated by sequential linkage of additional ubiquitin molecules to each other through specific lysine residues (Lys-48 or Lys-63). Multi-ubiquitination of a protein leads to its recognition and consequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome (3Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar, 5Pickart C.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 6Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved in the recognition of specific proteins as substrates of the ubiquitin system are not fully understood. However, it is likely that E3 ubiquitin protein ligases are the key components that provide specificity to the ubiquitin system by direct interaction with specific substrates. Although two E3 activities had previously been identified from rabbit reticulocytes (E3a and E3b) (9Heller A. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6532-6535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Reiss Y. Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10378-10383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Reiss Y. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3685-3690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was the cloning and characterization of E6AP that revealed structural and functional features of a new class of E3 enzymes. E6AP was initially identified as a 100-kDa cellular protein that, in conjunction with the E6 oncoprotein of human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV), constituted the E3 activity in the ubiquitination of p53 (7Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar, 12Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4129-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 13Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 14Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). E6AP was also found to promote the ubiquitination of cellular proteins in the absence of E6, indicating that E6AP could function as an E3 enzyme independent of E6 (7Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of E6AP revealed a region of approximately 350 amino acids in the carboxyl terminus that was highly conserved among a number of proteins from various organisms (15Huibregtse J. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). This region, subsequently termed the HECT domain, contains a conserved cysteine residue that serves as the active site for thiol ester formation with ubiquitin (15Huibregtse J. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). In addition to E6AP, several other Hect domain proteins have now been shown to be capable of forming thiol ester complexes, suggesting that Hect-containing proteins belong to a family of structurally related ubiquitin protein ligases (8Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 15Huibregtse J. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the specificity of substrate recognition by the ubiquitin system may be achieved by E3 enzymes capable of direct interaction with specific substrates. In the case of Hect proteins for instance, their divergent amino-terminal sequences may provide the necessary diversity required for substrate recognition, whereas their conserved carboxyl terminus (Hect domain) can interact with specific E2 enzymes and catalyze the ubiquitination of bound substrates (16Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4918-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 17Huibregtse J.M. Yang J.C. Beaudenon S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To date, only a small number of proteins have been identified as substrates of Hect E3 enzymes. The general amino acid permease Gap1 and uracil permease Fur4 have been reported to be ubiquitinated by RSP5 (NPI1), a Hect protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (19Galan J.M. Moreau V. Andre B. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10946-10952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 20Hein C. Springael J. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Andre B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The large subunit of RNA polymerase II (Rpb1) was recently identified also as an RSP5 substrate (17Huibregtse J.M. Yang J.C. Beaudenon S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 8: 3656-3661Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition, theSchizosaccharomyces pombe homologue of RSP5, Pub1, has been shown to target the CDC25 phosphatase for ubiquitin-dependent degradation (21Nefsky B. Beach D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the case of E6AP, p53 is the only known substrate; however, the ubiquitination of p53 by E6AP is dependent upon the presence of oncogenic E6 proteins of HPV. To date no other substrate for E6AP-mediated ubiquitination has been isolated. Interestingly, E6AP was recently identified as the gene affected in Angelman syndrome, a genetic neurological disorder. A majority of the mutations in E6AP is predicted to abolish the catalytic activity of E6AP, raising the possibility that deregulation of E6AP substrates may contribute to the pathogenesis of Angelman syndrome (22Kishino T. Lalande M. Wagstaff J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar,23Matsuura T. Sutcliffe J.S. Fang P. Galjaard R.J. Jiang Y.H. Benton C.S. Rommens J.M. Beaudet A.L. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify E6-independent substrates of E6AP, we isolated one of the human homologues of yeast Rad23 (HHR23A) as an E6AP-interacting protein using the yeast two-hybrid system (18Kumar S. Kao W.H. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13548-13554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 24Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T.

Rad23 is involved in excision repair of UV-damaged DNA and has also been implicated in spindle pole body duplication and cell cycle progression in S. cerevisiae (25Biggins S. Ivanovska I. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1331-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26Miller R.D. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Gen.

Biol. 1997; 17: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Two homologues of Rad23 exist in humans, HHR23A and HHR23B (24Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoiejmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1831-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Both of these proteins have been reported to bind and function with the xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) protein in nucleotide excision repair (NER) (28Masutani C. Araki M. Sugasawa K. van der Spek P.J. Yamada A. Uchida A. Maekawa T. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6915-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 29Sugasawa K.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6924-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our results identify HHR23A as a novel, E6-independent substrate of E6AP. We demonstrate that HHR23A interacts with E6AP and is efficiently ubiquitinated in an E6AP-dependent manner in vitro. By using anti-HHR23A and anti-ubiquitin antibodies, a small fraction of endogenous HHR23A was found conjugated to ubiquitin. Transient expression of wild-type E6AP enhanced the ubiquitinated fraction of HHR23A, whereas a dominant negative E6AP mutant inhibited HHR23A ubiquitination in vivo. Although HHR23A appears to be a stable protein in asynchronously growing cells, we have found that HHR23A protein levels are regulated during cell cycle progression. The level of HHR23A was found to be the highest in M phase and early G1, with a consistent 3–5-fold decrease occurring during late G1 and early S phase, indicating targeted degradation of the protein at specific stages of the cell cycle. The decrease in HHR23A protein levels was completely blocked by transient expression of dominant negative E6AP, providing direct evidence for the involvement of E6AP in the cell cycle-dependent degradation of HHR23A. Significantly, treatment of cells with UV radiation also abolished HHR23A degradation, suggesting that DNA damage may regulate HHR23A stability. At present, the precise roles of HHR23 proteins in repair of UV-damaged DNA is not clear. Nevertheless, our data suggest that E6AP-mediated ubiquitination of HHR23A may be important in regulating its function in DNA repair and cell cycle progression. A modified version of the yeast two-hybrid screen used to identify E6AP-interacting proteins has been described previously (18Kumar S. Kao W.H. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13548-13554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interacting clones were isolated, and their DNA sequence was determined by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The BLAST algorithm was used to search GenBankTM data bases, and eight independent inserts of varying lengths were identified as HHR23A. Clone 15-2, containing the entire open reading frame of HHR23A, was used for further analysis. Thehhr23a and hhr23b genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using appropriate oligonucleotide primers and were subcloned as 5′ BamHI/3′ SalI fragments into pGem-1 (Promega) under T7 RNA polymerase orientation for in vitro transcription and translation. For expression in bacteria as GST fusion proteins, polymerase chain reaction-derived HHR23 cDNAs (5′ BamHI/3′ SalI) were inserted in frame with GST into pGex-4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bacterial expression constructs for E1 and various E2s were described previously (18Kumar S. Kao W.H. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13548-13554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). E6AP constructs for in vitro synthesis, baculovirus-based vectors for expression of E6AP in insect cells, and CMV-E6AP constructs for mammalian cell expression have been described (7Scheffner M.

GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli HB101 and affinity purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The relative amounts of GST-HHR23 proteins were determined against known amounts of bovine serum albumin by Coomassie Blue staining.In vitro synthesis of proteins was carried out in TNT-coupled wheat germ extracts (WGE, Promega) as per manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of E6AP from Hi5 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing wild-type or mutant E6AP proteins has been described (7Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M.

E6AP synthesized in vitro using WGE (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine was incubated with approximately 2 μg of GST or 1 μg each of GST-HHR23 proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in binding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin/leupeptin mix) for 3 h at 4°C. Reactions were washed four times in binding buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In vitro ubiquitination assay of HHR23A has been described previously (18Kumar S. Kao W.H. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13548-13554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, HHR23 proteins were synthesized in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine for 90 min at 30°C using TNT-coupled WGE (Promega). 5-μl aliquots of in vitrotranslated HHR23 proteins were incubated with 5–10 ng of E1, approximately 100 ng of E2 (UbcH7), 200 ng each of WT or mutant (C833A) E6AP, and 4 μg of ubiquitin (Sigma) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol. Reactions were terminated after 1.5 h at 30°C by the addition of SDS sample buffer and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Early passage human diploid fibroblasts GM6419 and XPC (GM2995) cells were obtained from Coriell Cell Repository. 2C. Maki, unpublished observations. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (for COS.7 and U2OS cells) or 15% (for GM6419 or XPC cells) fetal bovine serum at 37°C with 5% CO2. Transfection of COS.7 cells was performed using standard procedures essentially as described (32Talis A.L. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6439-6445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). 10 μg each of CMV-HA-E6AP DNA was introduced into cells by the CaCl2method, and whole cell lysates were prepared 60 h post-transfection for immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. U2OS cells were transfected with 10 μg each of CMV-HA-E6AP (WT or C833A) using the FuGene6 transfection reagent as per manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). GM6419, U2OS, and XPC cells were plated at an approximate density of 106 cells per 10-cm dish and allowed to grow for 14 h. At the end of this period, cells were refed with fresh media containing 500 ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma) (33Ludlow J.W. Glendening C.L. Livingston D.M. DeCaprio J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). After 20 h a mitotic shake was performed by gentle pipeting to remove loosely adherent mitotic cells. For each time course experiment, seven 10-cm dishes for U2OS cells and 14 10-cm dishes for GM6419 and XPC cells were used. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with media to remove any nocodazole. The cells were then resuspended in 7 ml of media, and 1 ml was removed as the M phase sample. Equal aliquots (1 ml each) of remaining cells were plated in six 35-mm plates for each of the time points to be analyzed (i.e. 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 h). At the end of each time point, cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and whole cell lysates were prepared by incubating cells in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin/leupeptin mix) for 15 min on ice followed by gentle sonication. Absorbance measurements at a wavelength of 595 nm were done to quantify the total protein amounts present in each sample. For the experiment shown in Fig. 5, U2OS cells were transfected with CMV-E6AP constructs using FuGene transfection reagent. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were synchronized by nocodazole treatment for 24 h. Mitotic cells were collected and replated for indicated amounts of time, and cell extracts were prepared at the end of each time point. In experiments involving UV radiation (Fig. 6), 2 h after plating (post-mitotic shake), cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and irradiated with an 8-J UV dose using UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). The cells were immediately refed with fresh media and transferred back to 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.Figure 6Effect of UV radiation on HHR23A protein levels. U2OS cells were treated with nocodazole (as in Fig.4 A), and mitotic cells were collected by shake-off and centrifugation. Equal numbers of cells were replated and allowed to grow for 2 h. At the end of this time period, one set of plates was UV-irradiated at a dose of 8 J (lanes 4–6) and immediately transferred back to the incubator. Cell extracts were prepared at the time points indicated, and HHR23A was detected by immunoblotting with anti-HHR23A antibodies. Protein levels were quantitated using NIH Image software (see bar graph). In the unirradiated set (lanes 1–3), a 3-fold decrease is seen in HHR23A levels at 16 h post-mitotic shake (early S; comparelanes 1 and 2). In contrast, UV radiation (lanes 4–6) completely blocked the decrease in HHR23A levels (compare lanes 4 and 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Rabbit polyclonal sera against GST-HHR23A were generated at Babco. To detect ubiquitinated HHR23A species in mammalian cells (untransfected or transfected with E6AP constructs), whole cell extracts of COS.7 and U2OS cells were prepared in RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/μl aprotinin/leupeptin mix). Cells from three confluent 10-cm plates were lysed, and HHR23A was immunoprecipitated from 2 mg of total cell extract in RIPA buffer at 4°C with anti-HHR23A antibodies. 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (v/v) was added after 4 h, and samples were washed extensively in RIPA buffer to avoid co-precipitation of proteins other than HHR23A. As control, equal amounts of cell extracts (2 mg) were subjected to precipitation with preimmune sera. Immunoprecipitates were boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Nen) using standard procedures, and immunoblot analysis was carried out with anti-HHR23A and anti-ubiquitin antibodies. Detection of proteins was performed with ECL reagents (Nen). HHR23A ubiquitination after transfection of COS.7 cells with CMV-HA-E6AP constructs was detected similarly by immunoprecipitation (in RIPA buffer) and immunoblotting of 2 mg of whole cell lysates with anti-HHR23A antibodies. Expression of E6AP (WT and C833A) in U2OS cells was detected by immunoblotting with anti-HA MAb (12CA5, Babco). For the time course analysis, GM6419, U2OS, or XPC cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer by gentle sonication, and 100 μg of whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. HHR23A and cyclin A were detected by immunoblotting with anti-HHR23A or anti-cyclin A antibodies (BF683, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Quantitation of relative protein amounts was performed by using the Gel Plotting Macros feature of NIH-Image software. In an attempt to identify potential substrates and regulators of E6AP, we used a modified version of the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate cDNA clones that encode E6AP-interacting proteins. A catalytically inactive form of E6AP in which the active site cysteine residue is substituted with alanine was used as bait to avoid potential degradation of interacting proteins (18Kumar S. Kao W.H. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13548-13554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). E6AP (C833A) was fused in frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and introduced into the yeast reporter strain MaV103. Expression of the fusion protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with anti-E6AP and anti-Gal4 DNA-binding domain antibodies. The prey cDNA library, fused to the Gal4 activation domain, was derived from activated human T cells. Interacting clones were isolated by plating transformants on histidine drop-out plates containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole (18Kumar S. Kao W.H. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13548-13554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interaction positive cDNAs were rescued, and the DNA sequence of isolated clones was determined. Using the BLAST algorithm, eight independent clones consisting of cDNA inserts of varying lengths were identified as HHR23A, one of the human homologues of the yeast DNA repair protein Rad23 (24Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoiejmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F.

Clone 15-2, containing the entire open reading frame of HHR23A, was subcloned into appropriate vectors and used in further analysis. To confirm the interaction between HHR23A and E6AP, the HHR23A cDNA was cloned into pGEX-4T-2 vector and expressed as a GST fusion protein in bacteria. We also wanted to ascertain whether the second human homologue of yeast Rad23, HHR23B, which shares over 70% sequence homology with HHR23A, would interact with E6AP (24Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoiejmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1831-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Consequently, we obtained the HHR23B cDNA and expressed it as a fusion protein with GST in bacteria. Both HHR23 proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads and assayed for their ability to bind radiolabeled E6AP synthesized in vitro using wheat germ extract (which does not contain endogenous E6AP). Fig.1 A (lanes 2 and3) shows that GST-HHR23A and GST-HHR23B are both capable of efficient interaction with E6AP. The GST portion alone failed to bind E6AP, serving as negative control (lane 1). One interesting feature of the HHR23 proteins is the presence of a ubiquitin-like region in their amino terminus (24Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K.

This region is most likely an integral part of these proteins as it lacks the Gly-Gly sequence present in the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin required for cleavage of ubiquitin peptides from linear molecules (3Hochstrasser M.

https://openalex.org/W2021485188,"Human excision nuclease removes DNA damage by concerted dual incisions bracketing the lesion. The dual incisions are accomplished by sequential and partly overlapping actions of six repair factors, RPA, XPA, XPC, TFIIH, XPG, and XPF·ERCC1. Of these, RPA, XPA, and XPC have specific binding affinity for damaged DNA. To learn about the role of these three proteins in damage recognition and the order of assembly of the excision nuclease, we measured the binding affinities of XPA, RPA, and XPC to a DNA fragment containing a single (6-4) photoproduct and determined the rate of damage excision under a variety of reaction conditions. We found that XPC has the highest affinity to DNA and that RPA has the highest selectivity for damaged DNA. Under experimental conditions conducive to binding of either XPA + RPA or XPC to damaged DNA, the rate of damage removal was about 5-fold faster for reactions in which XPA + RPA was the first damage recognition factor presented to DNA compared with reactions in which XPC was the first protein that had the opportunity to bind to DNA. We conclude that RPA and XPA are the initial damage sensing factors of human excision nuclease. Human excision nuclease removes DNA damage by concerted dual incisions bracketing the lesion.

We conclude that RPA and XPA are the initial damage sensing factors of human excision nuclease. In human nucleotide excision repair, 14 polypeptides in six repair factors act in concert to excise DNA damage in the form of 24–32-nucleotide long oligomers (1Sancar A. Annu. Rev.

The six repair factors are XPA, RPA, XPC, TFIIH, XPG, and XPF·ERCC1 (3Mu D. Park C.-H. Matsunaga T. Hsu D.S. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19451-19456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). All three proteins have been reported to have moderate preference for damaged DNA compared with undamaged DNA as tested by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, filter binding assay, or damaged DNA affinity chromatography. Furthermore, using a pull-down assay it was found that the combination of RPA + XPA conferred increased selectivity for damaged DNA (14He Z. Henrickson L.A. Wold M.S. Ingles C.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 15Li L. Lu X. Peterson C.A. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5396-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). These findings led to a model whereby the initial damage sensing was performed by XPA + RPA, which subsequently recruited the other repair factors to the site of damage (1Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 2Wood R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 135-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Indeed, a comprehensive study of the excision nuclease assembly revealed that the first high-specificity complex is formed in the presence of XPA + RPA + XPC + TFIIH (16Wakasugi M. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6669-6674Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) under conditions known to cause specific unwinding of substrate at the site of the lesion (17Evans E.

Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 223-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar), however, raised some questions about the validity of published models for the assembly of human excision nuclease. In this study (19Sugasawa K. Ng J.M.Y. Masutani C. Iwai S. van der Spek P.J. Eker A.P.M. Hanaoka F. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 223-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar), it was found that an XPC footprint was readily obtained on a (6-4) photoproduct containing DNA fragment in contrast to reported failures to obtain DNase I footprint of XPA and RPA (18Mu D. Wakasugi M. Hsu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28971-28979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was reported that preincubation of damaged DNA with XPC protein followed by addition of other repair factors in the form of a partially purified cell extract resulted in a higher rate of repair relative to reaction conditions in which damaged DNA was incubated first with XPA or XPA + RPA prior to addition of extract containing the additional repair factors (19Sugasawa K. Ng J.M.Y. Masutani C. Iwai S. van der Spek P.J. Eker A.P.M. Hanaoka F. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 223-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Independently, it was reported that the yeast homologue of XPC, the Rad4·Rad23 complex, also bound to damaged DNA with high specificity (20Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31541-31546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Jansen L.E.T. Verhage R.A. Brouwer J. J. Biol.

Masutani C. Iwai S. van der Spek P.J. Eker A.P.M. Hanaoka F. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Mol.

Previous studies on damage recognition were carried out by several groups using a variety of both DNA damage and methods to detect DNA-protein interactions (8Jones C.J. Wood R.D.

In order to address the issue of specificities and order of assembly of the three proteins implicated in damage recognition we decided to investigate the binding of XPA, RPA, and XPC to a DNA duplex containing a (6-4) photoproduct by using a band mobility shift assay and DNase I footprinting. In addition, we used repair factors purified to homogeneity to conduct repair kinetic experiments under a variety of “order of addition” conditions. Of the three damage recognition proteins tested, we find the best discrimination between damaged and undamaged DNA with RPA protein followed by comparable levels of discrimination for the XPA and XPC proteins. Significantly, we find that preincubation of damaged DNA with XPA, RPA, or XPA + RPA results in about 5-fold faster rate of repair relative to DNA preincubated with XPC prior to addition of other repair factors. Our results are consistent with initial damage recognition by RPA or the RPA·XPA complex followed by formation of a higher stability DNA-protein complex by XPC recruited independently or in association with TFIIH to form a four repair factor preincision complex of high specificity. The substrate for DNase I footprinting and repair assay was a 136-bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); MBP, maltose-binding protein; TBP, TATA-binding protein. duplex containing a (6-4) photoproduct in the center. The sequence and preparation of this substrate have been described elsewhere (22Mu D. Tursun M. Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For the excision repair assay the duplex contained 32P label at the 4th phosphodiester bond 5′ to the photoproduct and the duplex for the footprinting assay contained the radiolabel at the 5′ terminus of the complementary strand. The substrate for electrophoretic mobility shift assay was a 49-mer duplex which was obtained by digesting the internally labeled 136-mer with PvuII and HindIII restriction endonucleases followed by purification of 49-mer after electrophoresis through a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The concentrations of all substrates were determined by Cerenkov counting. MBP-XPA, (His)6-XPA, RPA, XPC·HR23B, XPC, XPG, XPF·ERCC1, and TFIIH were purified as described previously (4Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 7Matsunaga T. Park C.H. Bessho T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3833-3837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For purification of MBP-XPC·HR23B protein, a baculovirus construct was prepared by inserting the malE gene 5′ to the XPC gene in a construct previously used for making XPC·HR23B heterodimer (13Reardon J.T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19451-19456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The fusion protein was purified by chromatography on amylose resin (New England Biolabs), followed by single-stranded DNA cellulose (Sigma) and DEAE-agarose (Bio-Rad) resins. The fusion protein was as active as native XPC·HR23B in complementation assay or reconstitution assays. For clarity in the presentation we will refer to the XPC·HR23B heterodimer as “XPC” in this paper. When necessary, the three forms of XPC used in this study will be identified explicitly as XPC monomer, XPC·HR23B, and MBP-XPC·HR23B, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies against XPA were from Neomarkers, polyclonal antibodies against the p34 subunit of RPA were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the monoclonal antibody against MBP was purchased from Sigma. The 49-bp duplex containing the (6-4) photoproduct or control DNA without the photoproduct were incubated at a concentration of 0.12 nmwith the indicated concentrations of repair proteins in 25 μl of reaction buffer which contained 32 mm Hepes·KOH, pH 7.9, 64 mm KCl, 6.44 mm MgCl2, 0.16 mm dithiothreitol, 0.16 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, and 4% (v/v) glycerol. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, the samples were loaded directly onto 3.5 or 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 1 × TBE (50 mmTris borate, pH 7.9, 1.2 mm EDTA). Electrophoresis was carried out at room temperature at 20 mA for 1.5 h. Mobility shift assays to identify various forms of preincision complexes 1, 2, and 3 were performed as described previously (16Wakasugi M. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6669-6674Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography and quantitative analyses were performed using an AMBIS scanner system. In supershift assays (mobility shift with antibody) DNA and protein were preincubated, antibody was added to the reaction mixture, and following an additional 10-min incubation, the samples were loaded onto the polyacrylamide gel. 3 fmol of DNA was incubated with the repair factors at the indicated concentrations in 25 μl of reaction buffer at 30 °C for 30 min. CaCl2 was added to 3.8 mm followed by 0.01 unit of DNase I (Life Technologies Inc.) and incubated at 22 °C for 3 min. The DNA was extracted with phenol:chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in formamide:dye loading reaction mixture and separated on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels along with Maxam-Gilbert G + A chemical sequence ladder. All the repair factors used were purified to near homogeneity (4Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 7Matsunaga T. Park C.H. Bessho T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol.

A standard reaction contained 3 fmol of substrate and 50 ng of MBP-XPA (or His-XPA), 300 ng of RPA, 10 ng of XPC·HR23B, 150 ng of TFIIH, 10 ng of XPG, and 20 ng of XPF·ERCC1 in 25 μl of reaction buffer. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times and then DNA was extracted with phenol:chloroform and separated on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Since the role of XPC in damage recognition is a critical question addressed in this study the amount of XPC necessary for optimal excision reaction was titrated carefully. Under our experimental conditions, 10–20 ng of XPC in a reaction mixture constituted saturating amounts, increasing XPC to 60 ng/reaction severely inhibited excision (4Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Quantitative analyses were done by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) or by scanning the autoradiograms with a Molecular Dynamics Computing Densitometer Series 300 instrument. In addition to the standard excision assay, we conducted “omission type” and “sequential addition type” assays. In omission type assays, the substrate was incubated with all but one of the repair factors for 10 min, then the omitted factor was added and further incubation continued at 30 °C. In sequential addition assays, the substrate was first incubated with one (or two) repair factor for 10 min, and then the rest of the repair factors were added and incubation was continued at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by quick-freezing on dry ice, and the excision products were analyzed by autoradiography following resolution in 8% sequencing gels. Although XPA (8Jones C.J. Wood R.D.

To learn about the contributions of these repair proteins to damage recognition by human excision nuclease, we performed binding assays with unmodified and (6-4) photoproduct containing 49-bp duplex DNAs using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay for quantitative analysis. As a positive control, we used the E. coli UvrA protein which is known to be the damage recognition subunit of E. coli excinuclease (24Van Houten B. Gamper H. Sancar A. Hearst J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13180-13187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the results of these experiments. The approximate specific and nonspecific binding constants calculated from the data in Fig. 1 are summarized in Table I. XPC is the protein with the highest affinity for both damaged and undamaged DNA and RPA has the best discriminatory power. The selectivity factor, which is defined as the ratio of equilibrium dissociation constant for the (6-4) photoproduct to the equilibrium constant to a non-damaged base pair (25Von Hippel P.H. Berg O.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 93: 6443-6447Google Scholar), is about 133 for RPA, 70 for XPA, and 42 for XPC. Clearly, based on these values, none of the three human damaged DNA-binding proteins have enough specificity to function as the “damage recognition subunit” of the human excision nuclease. We reasoned that the three subunits may act in a cooperative fashion to achieve the high specificity observed in vivo.Table ISpecific and nonspecific binding constants of excision repair proteinsKNSKSSelectivityXPA4.2 × 10−76.0 × 10−970RPA4.0 × 10−73.0 × 10−9133XPC5.0 × 10−91.2 × 10−1042The equilibrium dissociation constants for nonspecific DNA (KNS) were estimated from the protein concentrations which bound 50% of the substrate.

We wished to confirm the band mobility shift data by footprinting experiments and, in addition, to use footprinting to detect any potential cooperative interactions between these three subunits. We were unable to obtain a damage-specific footprint with XPA, RPA, or XPC under a variety of conditions where the concentrations of DNA, the binding proteins, or of DNase I were the variables. Under all reaction conditions tested, the three factors inhibited the DNase I digestions of both undamaged or damaged DNA to the same extent.

Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 223-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) we show the results of our footprinting experiment with a similar substrate in Fig. 2 A. We were unable to observe either a specific footprint or a hypersensitive site when the damaged strand was labeled. However, with label in the complementary strand, a specific XPC effect was seen. Visual inspection of this figure as well as quantitative analysis of densitometric scans show no difference between the degree of protection of undamaged and damaged DNA by XPC protein. Using up to 10-fold higher concentrations of XPC than the one used in this experiment caused progressively stronger inhibition of DNase I uniformly and with no preference for damage DNA (data not shown). Interestingly, however, in agreement with the previous report (19Sugasawa K. Ng J.M.Y. Masutani C. Iwai S. van der Spek P.J. Eker A.P.M. Hanaoka F. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 223-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar), we do find that the 16th phosphodiester bond 3′ to the AA across from the (6-4) photoproduct becomes hypersensitive to DNase I digestion at XPC concentrations that cause overall protection of damaged and undamaged DNA (compare Fig. 2 A, lanes 4–6 and lanes 10–12). Since the comparison of lanes with vastly unequal overall digestions could give rise to artificial “footprints” we took special precautions to compare only lanes with comparable overall DNase I digestion as evidenced by the amount of undigested full-length fragment. To our surprise, neither under these conditions nor under conditions of unequal DNase I digestion, were we able to obtain an XPC DNase I footprint as defined by specific protection of the area around the photoproduct. Equally surprising was the observation that even though RPA exhibited the best discrimination between undamaged and damaged DNA by the band shift assay it failed to exhibit a specific footprint either in the form of protection from DNase I around the photoproduct or in the form of induction of a DNase I-hypersensitive site only in the damaged DNA. XPA, which exhibits less selectivity by the gel retardation assay, also failed to elicit a specific DNase I footprint (data not shown). Hence we decided to test combinations of two and three damage recognition factors to find out if such combinations improve the selectivity and give rise to damage-specific footprints. Fig. 2 B shows DNase I footprints for various combinations of XPA, RPA, and XPC. The XPA + RPA combination (lane 4) causes uniform inhibition of DNase I as is seen with individual factors. The combinations of XPC + RPA (lane 6) or XPC + XPA (lane 7), however, reveal an interesting phenomenon: although at the XPC concentration used in this particular experiment the XPC-induced hypersensitive site was only marginally evident (lane 3), the intensity of the hypersensitive band in reactions with XPC + RPA (lane 6) or XPC + XPA (lane 7) was increased and the combination of all three proteins gave rise to the most intense hypersensitivity (lane 5) consistent with additive stimulatory effects of XPA and RPA on the XPC-induced hypersensitive site. Under no conditions, however, were we able to obtain a specific footprint around the damage site. As is apparent in lanes 4–6, when DNase I protection was seen, it extended over the entire fragment and manipulations of the concentrations of the three proteins did not confer further specificity (data not shown). The footprinting experiments, nevertheless, revealed a specific effect of XPA and RPA on XPC-DNA interactions never seen before in studies aimed at understanding the assembly of human excision nuclease. The data in Fig. 2 B raised the possibility that XPC, XPA, and RPA may form a specific complex on damaged DNA. We wished to search for such a complex by conducting gel mobility shift assays. The results of gel mobility shift assays with the pairwise combinations of XPA, RPA, and XPC are shown in Fig.3. In agreement with earlier reports (14He Z. Henrickson L.A. Wold M.S. Ingles C.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar,15Li L. Lu X. Peterson C.A. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5396-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) the XPA + RPA combination produces a DNA-protein complex with higher stability than the complex formed with either protein alone (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2–4). Although the retarded DNA band seen when both proteins are present is only marginally slower than the RPA·DNA band (lanes 3 and 4) it appears to contain both XPA and RPA: the XPA antibodies partially supershift this band but mostly disrupt it giving rise to a faster migrating DNA band which corresponds to XPA·DNA and to a slower migrating band which is the undisrupted band XPA·RPA·DNA complex superimposed onto the RPA·DNA band (lane 5). The anti-RPA antibodies supershift the entire XPA·RPA·DNA band (lane 6) consistent with the interpretation that this complex contains RPA. Fig. 3 B shows the result of XPA + XPC combinations. To probe for the presence of XPC in DNA-protein complexes: we employed two forms of XPC; “XPC monomer” which is as active in the excision assay as the heterodimer (13Reardon J.T. Mu D. Sancar A. J.

Recent identification of two human homologues of p53 has raised the prospect of functional interactions between family members via a conserved oligomerization domain. Here we report in vitro andin vivo analysis of homo- and hetero-oligomerization of p53 and its homologues, p63 and p73. The oligomerization domains of p63 and p73 can independently fold into stable homotetramers, as previously observed for p53. However, the oligomerization domain of p53 does not associate with that of either p73 or p63, even when p53 is in 15-fold excess. On the other hand, the oligomerization domains of p63 and p73 are able to weakly associate with one another in vitro. In vivo co-transfection assays of the ability of p53 and its homologues to activate reporter genes showed that a DNA-binding mutant of p53 was not able to act in a dominant negative manner over wild-type p73 or p63 but that a p73 mutant could inhibit the activity of wild-type p63. These data suggest that mutant p53 in cancer cells will not interact with endogenous or exogenous p63 or p73 via their respective oligomerization domains. It also establishes that the multiple isoforms of p63 as well as those of p73 are capable of interacting via their common oligomerization domain.

Tumor suppressor p53 is a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in control of the cell cycle and/or apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 1Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Biochim. Biophys.

In response to cellular stress, particularly DNA damage, p53 protein levels rise, leading to changes in expression of p53 responsive genes and subsequent cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Growth arrest or cell death prevents damaged DNA from being replicated and suggests a role for p53 in maintaining the integrity of the genome (4Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4400) Google Scholar). This DNA damage checkpoint activity is central to its role as a tumor suppressor and also of major importance in the response of many cancers to conventional therapies that trigger apoptosis by damaging DNA. Inactivation of p53 through deletion, mutation, or interaction with cellular or viral proteins is a key step in over half of all human cancers (5Nigro J.M. Baker S.J. Preisinger A.C. Jessup J.M.

To address the question of whether p53 family members and their isoforms can homo- and/or hetero-oligomerize and thereby affect the transcriptional activities of one another, we have assessed the ability of each oligomerization domain to homo- and hetero-oligomerize in vitro, as well as the in vivo effects of coexpressing pairs of proteins. The sequences encoding residues 310–360 of human p53, 355–404 of human p63, and 345–383 of human p73 were subcloned into the pET15b vector (Novagen Inc.), and residues 359–399 of p63 and residues 350–383 of p73 were subcloned into pET19b (Novagen Inc.) using standard techniques (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Mainiatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: F.1-F.7Google Scholar). Residue numbers for p63 correspond to those of the p63 isoforms containing the full N terminus (13Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids express 6 histidine (pET15b) or 10 histidine (pET19b) residues followed by a linker containing a thrombin (pET15b) or enterokinase (pET19b) cleavage site and a His-Met dipeptide immediately N-terminal to the protein of interest. Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-[pLys-S] harboring the desired plasmid and purified by Nickel affinity chromatography as described previously (19Johnson C.R. Morin P.E. Arrowsmith C.H. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5309-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The yield of purified protein was 10–20 mg/liter of culture. When desired the polyhistidine tags were cleaved with the appropriate enzyme according the manufacturer's recommendations, the proteins separated from the His tag peptide by Nickel affinity chromatography. Prior to experiments, samples were dialyzed for 24 h at 4 °C three times against 2 liters of buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) using Spectra/por 3500 molecular weight cut-off dialysis membranes. Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficient ε = 1450m−1 cm−1 (at 275 nm) per solvent exposed tyrosine residue in 6.5 m guanidine HCl. Far UV CD spectra were recorded on an Aviv 62A DS circular dichroism spectrometer equipped with a thermoelectric temperature controller. Measurements were made using a 0.1-cm cuvette at a sample concentration of 75 μm(monomer). Thermal unfolding was followed by monitoring ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of temperature every 3 °C allowing 4 min for sample equilibration and a signal average of 99 s for each data point. Equimolar samples of His10-tagged and untagged proteins were mixed at ratios of 1:1, 1:10, and 1:15 and incubated in one of three conditions for assessment of hetero-oligomerization: 1) Samples were incubated at room temperature overnight in a buffer of 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. 2) Samples were incubated at 95 °C for 20 min and cooled to 37 °C and then to 25 °C over 2 h at each step. 3) Samples were dialyzed against 2 liters of 8m urea, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, in Spectra/por 3500 molecular weight cut-off dialysis membrane for 8 h at 25 °C, followed by step-wise dialysis against 1 liter of similar buffers containing 6 and 4m urea at 25 °C and then 2 m urea and two steps against 2 liters of 0 m urea, 150 mmNaCl, 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, at 4 °C. Samples were subsequently loaded onto a 300-μl bed of Qiagen nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads and washed with 10–15 ml of 35 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and eluted in 1-ml fractions with 4 ml of 500 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5. Aliquots (20 μl) from each fraction were run on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide Tricine 1The abbreviation used is: Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxy- methyl)ethyl]glycine. gel. For experiments with protein ratios of 10:1 or greater, 100 μl of wash and elution fractions were lyophilized and resuspended in 10 μl of distilled water before running on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide Tricine gel. Samples of 75 μmHis6-p73(345–383), p73(345–383), His6-p63(355–404), or p63(355–404) in 250 mmNaCl, 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, were mixed with glutaraldehyde (with final glutaraldehyde concentrations ranging from 0.0 to 0.28%) in a total volume of 15 μl. Samples were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of standard SDS-denaturing gel loading buffer. The resulting 20-μl samples were then loaded and run on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide glycine gel. A Superdex 75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column pre-equilibrated with 25 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, via a Biologic FPLC system (Bio-Rad) was loaded with 200 μl of protein and chromatographed with 1 column volume (about 40 ml) of buffer at 0.4 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected for further analysis. Eluted protein was detected by UV at 280 (molecular weight standards) or 254 nm (tetramerization domains); the oligomerization domains absorb UV light poorly at 280 nm, and high protein concentrations were not possible with p63 and p73, necessitating the use of a lower wavelength for detection. The following proteins (and their corresponding masses) were used as molecular weight standards to calibrate the column: bovine serum albumin (66,000), carbonic anhydrase (29,000), lysozyme (14,400), cytochrome c (12,400), aprotinin (6,000), and insulin chain B (3,500). Dextran blue (200,000) was used to determine the void volume. A plot of V e/V o(elution volume for a given molecular weight standard divided by the void volume of the column) versus log molecular weight was used to determine the molecular weights and thus the oligomeric states of the oligomerization domains. Cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a concentration of 2–5 × 105cells/well, 16–24 h prior to transfection. DNA transfection was achieved using LipofectAMINE Plus System (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In a typical experiment, 1 μg of reporter plasmid p53RGC-Luc was transfected with 70 ng of either pcDNA3 vector containing p53 or p73α and 70, 350, or 700 ng of pcDNA3 containing either p53 R273H or p73 R293H. The final DNA concentration was adjusted to 1,77 μg/well using pcDNA3. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed in 500 ml of passive lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured with the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Luciferase activities of the p53RGC-Luc vector (firefly luciferase) were normalized based on the luciferase activities of the cotransfected pRL-CMV (Renilla luciferase) to correct for variations in cell number and/or transfection efficiency between wells. SK-NA-S cell extracts prepared in SDS sample buffer were fractionated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon membranes by electrophoresis. Membranes were probed with p53 and p73α antibodies using a standard protocol and developed by chemiluminescence (Pierce). The tetramerization domain of p53 (residues 325–355) is the primary determinant of its oligomeric state (20Halazonetis T.D. Kandil A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5057-5064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Pavletich N.P. Chambers K.A. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1993; 12: 2556-2564Crossref Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 22Sturzbecher H. Brain R.C.

To determine whether p73 and p63 form homotetramers similar to those of p53, we expressed recombinant constructs containing the homologous domains of each protein as shown in Fig.1. Fig. 2shows SDS-polyacrylamide gels of p63(355–404) and p73(345–383) in the presence of increasing amounts of glutaraldehyde. As seen previously for p53, both p63 and p73 are clearly able to form homo-oligomers, with tetramers predominating at the highest glutaraldehyde concentrations. Size exclusion chromatography (data not shown) also indicate that p73(345–383) elutes with a molecular weight of 23,000, corresponding to that of a tetramer.Figure 2p73(345–383) and p63(355–404) are tetramers. A, glutaraldehyde cross-linking of His6-tagged p63(355–404). Samples (75 μmprotein monomer concentration) were incubated with increasing amounts of glutaraldehyde (0, 0.07, 0.13, 0.19, 0.24, and 0.28% in lanes 1–6, respectively) for 30 min at 25 °C. Aliquots (20 μl) were then run on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel with the NOVEX Mark12 protein standard in lane 7. B, same as forA using His6-tagged p73(345–383) with increasing glutaraldehyde from lanes 2–7 with the NOVEX Mark12 protein standard in lane 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then used CD spectroscopy to compare the amount of secondary structure present in p73(345–383) to that of a similar domain of p53 (Fig. 3 A). The shapes of the CD spectra for both protein domains are consistent with a similar secondary structure, taking into account the different lengths of each protein construct. We used the CD signal at 222 nm, which is indicative of α-helix, to monitor the stability of p73(345–383) as a function of temperature. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the tetramerization domain of p73 is very stable and does not start to unfold until temperatures of 60 °C or higher. Upon cooling the sample back to 25 °C, the original CD spectrum is obtained, showing that the thermal unfolding of this domain is reversible. This behavior is very similar to that of the p53 tetramerization domain (19Johnson C.R. Morin P.E. Arrowsmith C.H. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5309-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Similar CD spectra of p63(355–404) could not be obtained because of precipitation of the protein under CD conditions. However, heating of p63(355–404) to 85 °C followed by slow cooling and subsequent incubation with glutaraldehyde, resulted in cross-linking of the protein primarily to tetramers, indicating that p63 also refolds to a native-like state after thermal unfolding. Taken together these data show that the oligomerization domains of p63 and p73 form independently folded tetramers with a secondary structure and probably tertiary structure very similar to that of the homologous region of p53. To determine whether the tetramerization domain of p53 can associate with that of p63 and p73 to form hetero-oligomers, we performed protein-protein interaction assays using a polyhistidine-tagged p53 tetramerization domain and untagged p73(345–383) or p63(355–404). Mixing purified tagged and untagged proteins together followed by Ni2+ affinity chromatography consistently showed that only the histidine-tagged p53 protein was retained by the resin and that all of the untagged protein eluted in the wash (data not shown). However, it is possible that heterotetramers could not form under the conditions used above because of the high stability of the preformed homotetramers. Therefore, we used two methods (thermal and chemical denaturation) to unfold binary mixtures of homotetramers and dissociate them into monomeric subunits with subsequent refolding under native conditions. This process of simultaneous refolding mimics the process of co-expression of the two proteins in vivo. As shown in Fig.4, refolding of His-tagged p53 with either p63(355–404) or p73(345–383) followed by Ni2+chromatography again indicated no formation of hetero-oligomers. Because the unfolding of all three proteins is fully reversible, both in the presence and absence of the histidine tags (as shown above (Fig.3) and in Ref. 19Johnson C.R. Morin P.E. Arrowsmith C.H. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5309-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), a negative result because of the inability of each protein to refold under these conditions can be ruled out. In cancer cells, inactive mutant p53 is often overexpressed and could potentially hetero-oligomerize with and inactivate endogenous p73 or p63. Because the above experiments were performed at roughly equimolar ratios, we repeated the experiments using a 15-fold excess of p53 tetramerization domain. Again no interaction of p53 with p73 or p63 was observed using Coomassie Blue staining of the gel (data not shown). Alternatively, if a 10-fold excess of p73 was used relative to p53 and silver stain was used to visualize the protein bands, then we were able to see a very weak band for untagged p73 co-eluting with His-tagged p53 (Fig. 4 C). However, the ratio of co-eluted p73 was much less than that of p53. Taken together these results demonstrate that p53 does not hetero-oligomerize to a significant extent with either p63 or p73 via their tetramerization domains under a wide variety of conditions. When the same refolding experiments were performed with histidine-tagged p63 and untagged p73 (Fig.5), we found evidence of weak interactions between these two proteins. These were only observable when the experiments were performed with an excess of the untagged protein and with silver staining to visualize the protein bands. However, in contrast to the residual interaction of p53 with p73 shown in Fig. 4 C, the ratio of co-eluted untagged protein to His-tagged protein was much more significant in the case of p63/p73 (compare relative intensities in lane 10 of Fig.4 C with those in lane 11 of Fig. 5). Nevertheless, the extent of hetero-oligomerization between p63 and p73 appears to be less efficient than the homo-oligomerization of either protein. The biological significance of this result is unclear because it remains to be determined whether and to what extent p73 and p63 are co-expressed in the same cellular environment. The absence of hetero-oligomerization between p53 and p73 suggests that dominant negative mutants such as p53 R273H (23Chen J.Y. Funk W.D. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Minna J.D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2159-2166PubMed Google Scholar) or p73 R293H (11Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.-C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.-M. Dumont X. Ferrera P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar), which are defective for DNA binding and transcriptional activity, will not interfere with transcriptional activation by heterologous wild-type factors. Therefore, to further establish that p53 and p73 do not interact in vivo, p53 or p73α were co-expressed in SK-NA-S cells with various amounts of either p53 R273H or p73 R293H. Fig.6 A, shows that, as previously reported (23Chen J.Y. Funk W.D. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Minna J.D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2159-2166PubMed Google Scholar), excess of p53 R273H completely abolished the transcriptional activation of a p53-responsive luciferase gene by p53, whereas increasing amounts of the analogous mutant p73 R293H had almost no effect on p53 transactivation activity. The slight and constant inhibition observed with ×1, ×5, and ×10 excess of p73 R293H (Fig.6 A) was not reproducible and was correlated with a lower level of p53 expression than in the control experiment. When p73α was co-expressed with either p53 R273H or p73 R293H, the same results were obtained (Fig. 6 B); increasing amounts of p73 R293H efficiently blocked p73α-mediated transactivation of the luciferase gene, whereas under the same conditions no effect was observed with p53 R273H. In light of our results showing that p73 and p63 oligomerization domains can form heterotetramers, it was of interest to test for possible interaction of the two proteins when produced in the same cellular context. We therefore performed co-transfection experiments in which p53 R273H or p73 R293H were alternatively co-expressed with p63β in SK-NA-S cells, and the resulting p63-mediated transactivation of a RGC-luciferase reporter gene was measured. Fig. 7 shows that again the dominant negative p53 mutant does not interfere with p63 transcriptional activity, in good agreement with the observed lack of hetero-oligomerization of their respective tetramerization domains. p73 R293H on the other hand, clearly inhibits transactivation by p63 in this assay, also in agreement with our in vitro data. However, the degree of inhibition appears to be less efficient compared with that of either the p73 R293H inhibition of p73 or the p53 R273H inhibition of p53. This is also in agreement with our protein-protein interaction assays, which show a weak but significant interaction between p63 and p73 oligomerization domains. Both p63 and p73 are expressed in multiple isoforms with different transcriptional and biochemical properties that have yet to be fully understood. Although these isoforms differ in the number of residues at the N or C termini, all isoforms of a given gene product share an identical oligomerization domain. We have shown that the oligomerization domains of p63 and p73 form homotetramers, suggesting that proteins formed in vivo will likely be mixed oligomers composed of a statistical distribution of those isoforms available in a given cell type. This is consistent with the report by Yang et al. (13Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar) in which a glutathione S-transferase-tagged p63γ was able to interact with several other p63 isoforms. Kaghadet al. (11Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.-C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.-M. Dumont X. Ferrera P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar) also found weak interactions between p73α and p73β using the yeast two-hybrid assay. Both of these observations likely reflect interactions mediated by the oligomerization domain of p63 and p73, respectively, and likely have important implications for the activity of p63 or p73 in cells expressing multiple isoforms. We have also shown that p63 and p73 can potentially hetero-oligomerize via their tetramerization domains. This interaction appears to be weak because it is only observable with an excess of one of the two proteins, and dominant negative p73 mutants were not fully able to inhibit p63 transactivation even in 10-fold excess. Nevertheless, these data raise the possibility of cooperative or antagonistic interactions between p63 and p73 if they are co-expressed or incorrectly expressed in the same tissue. However, co-expression of both proteins has yet to be demonstrated, and further data on the expression patterns of both p63 and p73 will be needed to better understand the functional relationship, if any, between these two proteins. Many families of transcription factors exhibit combinatorial homotypic and heterotypic interactions via conserved oligomerization or protein-protein interaction domains. Our in vitro andin vivo experiments clearly support the notion that p53 does not hetero-oligomerize with p63 or p73, even though all three proteins likely homo-oligomerize via a similar three-dimensional structure. These facts can be rationalized if one considers the symmetry of the tetrameric form of the p53 oligomerization domain. The p53 tetramerization domain has three 2-fold axes of symmetry (24Lee W. Harvey T.S. Yin Y. Yau P. Litchfiield D. Arrowsmith C.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 25Jeffery P.D. Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1498-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). If we consider a single 2-fold axis (illustrated schematically in Fig.8), the symmetric nature of the oligomers may favor homotypic interactions at the expense of heterotypic interactions. In this two-dimensional example, the overall shape of each subunit (the rectangles) and oligomer (thesquares) would correspond to the global three-dimensional fold of each subunit and tetramer, respectively. The smaller surface details of each subunit (pointed or rounded) correspond to the different amino acid side chains of each subunit. Here the complementary fit between subunits favors homotypic interactions. The fact that the p63 and p73 oligomerization domains are more closely related to each other (58% identity) than either is to p53 (35 and 42% identity, respectively) may explain why p63 and p73 are able to interact to some extent. A recent mutagenesis study in which the oligomerization domains of p53 and chimeric p53/p63 and p53/p73 mutants were assayed for interaction also supports a symmetry-related explanation for the selectivity of hetero-oligomerization (26Mateu M.G. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3595-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the accumulation of mutant p53, as is frequently observed in human cancers, will likely not interfere with p63 or p73 transcriptional activity. However, while this manuscript was under review, it was reported that mutant p53 (R175H and R248W) but not wild-type p53 could co-immunoprecipitate with p73 and that these mutants but not wild-type p53 could reduce the transcriptional and apoptotic activities of p73 in H1299 cells (27Di Como C.J. Gaiddon C. Prives C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Because different p53 mutants and cell lines were used in this study, it is difficult to directly compare the results with ours. Nevertheless, the data presented here show that putative interactions between mutant p53 and p73 are unlikely to involve the oligomerization domains of each protein. Given that 1) only mutant p53 was observed to interact with p73, 2) the interaction was weak (5–10% of p73 associated with mutant p53 (27Di Como C.J. Gaiddon C. Prives C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar)), and 3) the interaction appears to be cell type-dependent (no interaction was observed in yeast (27Di Como C.J. Gaiddon C. Prives C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) or SK-NA-S (this study)) a more likely explanation is that the p73-mutant p53 interaction may be mediated by an as yet unidentified molecule specific to mutant p53 and only present in certain cell types. Our results also suggest that transactivation-deficient isoforms of p63 or p73 (such as N-terminally truncated proteins (13Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar)) will not hetero-oligomerize with wild-type p53, thereby affecting p53 transcriptional activity. Dominant negative inhibition via hetero-oligomerization of DNA-binding inactive and active p53 family members is a distinct mechanism from that involving competitive DNA binding between two or more family members (or isoforms thereof) with differing transcriptional activation properties. We have shown that the former mechanism is unlikely. However, this does not rule out a role for the latter mechanism in normal or tumorigenic cells, as recently suggested for p63 (13Yang A. Kaghad M.

ADAMTS-1 is a unique ADAM family protein with respect to the presence of thrombospondin type I motifs and the capacity to bind to the extracellular matrix. Because ADAMTS-1 has a potential zinc-binding motif in the metalloproteinase domain, we examined in this study whether ADAMTS-1 is an active metalloproteinase by means of the proteinase trapping mechanism of α2-macroglobulin. We found that the soluble type of ADAMTS-1 protein is able to form a covalent-binding complex with α2-macroglobulin. Furthermore, the point mutation within the zinc-binding motif of ADAMTS-1 protein eliminates its capacity to bind to α2-macroglobulin. These data demonstrate that the metalloproteinase domain of ADAMTS-1 is catalytically active. In addition, we showed that the removal of the pro-domain from the ADAMTS-1 precursor is impaired in the furin-deficient cell line, LoVo, and that the processing ability of the cells is restored by the co-expression of the furin cDNA. These data provide evidence that the ADAMTS-1 precursor is processed in vivo by furin endopeptidase in the secretory pathway. Consequently, ADAMTS-1 is an active metalloprotease that is associated with the extracellular matrix.

Most of ADAMs are membrane-anchored glycoproteins that are comprised of a pro-domain, a metalloprotease-like domain, a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich region, an epidermal growth factor repeat, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain. Fertilin, the first ADAM described, has been implicated in integrin-mediated sperm-egg binding (3Blobel C.P. Wolfsberg T.G. Turck C.W. Myles D.G. Primakoff P.P. White J.M.

Therefore, ADAMs are thought to play a role in cell-cell interactions. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-converting enzyme (TACE), which cleaves the membrane-anchored precursor of TNF-α and releasing TNF-α, also belongs to the ADAM family (6Black R.A.

In addition, TACE was shown to be involved in the processing of transforming growth factor α, TNF receptor, L-selectin, and the Alzheimer amyloid protein precursor (8Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P.

In Drosophila, an ADAM family gene,Kuzbanian, has been demonstrated to play a role in the lateral inhibition during neurogenesis by a cleavage of the extracellular domain of the transmembrane receptor Notch (10Rooke J.

These observations indicate that ADAMs also function as membrane-anchored metalloproteinases that are involved in the ectodomain shedding of cell-surface proteins. ADAMTS-1 was identified as a gene highly expressed in vivoin the colon 26 cachexigenic tumor (12Kuno K. Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The mouse adamts-1gene is mapped to chromosome 16, region C3–C5 (13Kuno K. Iizasa H. Ohno S. Matsushima K. Genomics. 1997; 46: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Like other typical ADAMs, the amino-terminal half-region of ADAMTS-1 consists of a proprotein and a metalloproteinase domain and a disintegrin-like domain that shares sequence similarity to the snake venom metalloproteinases. In contrast, the domain organization of the carboxyl-terminal half of ADAMTS-1 is completely different from other ADAMs. Instead of the transmembrane region, ADAMTS-1 has three thrombospondin (TSP) type I motifs that are found in both thrombospondins 1 and 2 (14Bornstein P. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3290-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). These TSP type I motifs of ADAMTS-1 are functional for binding to heparin. We have recently found that ADAMTS-1 is secreted and incorporated into the extracellular matrix (ECM) (15Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Analyses of deletion mutants have revealed that the carboxyl-terminal spacing region as well as three TSP type I motifs are responsible for the anchoring to the ECM (15Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). So far, approximately, 20 ADAM genes have been identified. These genes are classified into two groups. One is the metalloprotease active or potentially active group, which has the zinc-binding consensus sequence in the metalloproteinase domain. In contrast, some ADAMs, such as fertilin β (ADAM2), Crytestin (ADAM3), and MDC (ADAM11), have an inactive metalloproteinase domain apparently due to the absence of the zinc-binding motif (16Wolfsberg T.G.

Genet. 1993; 5: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). ADAMTS-1 possesses a potential zinc-binding motif in its metalloproteinase domain, but this motif seems to be incomplete. In this study, to clarify the fundamental properties of ADAMTS-1, we examined whether the ADAMTS-1 protein is proteolytically active based on its capacity to form a covalent complex with α2-macroglobulin (α2M). COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, LoVo, was cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Nissui) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The FLAG epitope tag (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) expression vectors for the wild type ADAMTS-1 protein or the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants, X4 and X5, were constructed using pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) regulated under a cytomegalovirus promoter, as described previously (15Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). An amino acid-substituted mutant, E386Q, was constructed by mutagenesis based on a PCR technique. Briefly, the first PCR reaction was carried out between the upstream forward and reverse mutated primer within the zinc-binding motif using ADAMTS-1 cDNA as a template. The second PCR reaction was performed between the first PCR product and the downstream reverse primer. The resultant PCR fragments containing the mutated sequence were digested by XhoI andBamHI and were used for the replacement of the corresponding fragment of the X5 expression vector. The nucleotide sequences of the mutants were confirmed by direct sequencing. The DNA sequencing reaction was performed by a PCR employing fluorescent dideoxynucleotides and was analyzed by a model 373A automated sequencer (Applied Biosystem). The furin expression vector pCMVFur (19Komada M. Hatsuzawa K. Shibamoto S. Ito F. Nakayama K. Kitamura N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. K. Nakayama (Tsukuba University). COS-7 cells (2 × 105 per dish) were transfected with the ADAMTS-1 expression vectors (2 μg) by means of the LipofectAMINE (6 μl) (Life Technologies, Inc.). The liposome-DNA complex solution was spread on cells in 3.5-cm dishes and incubated for 6 h. Thereafter, 1 ml of the DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum was added into the medium. Eighteen hours after transfection, the cells were washed with DMEM and further grown in 1 ml of DMEM with or without serum. Similarly, LoVo cells (4 × 105 per dish) were transfected with the ADAMTS-1 expression vector (1 μg) and the furin expression vector (1 μg) by means of the LipofectAMINE (6 μl) and further cultured in 1 ml of Ham's F-12 medium without serum. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (15Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 5% mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol), heated at 100 °C, and subjected to 7–10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked overnight in Block ACE (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Osaka, Japan) and then incubated with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, M2 (Eastman Kodak Co), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing, bound horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the immunoprecipitation experiments, aliquots of culture supernatants from transfected COS-7 cells were pretreated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated with anti-bovine α2M antibodies (Yagai, Co. Ltd., Yamagata, Japan). After 2 h at 4 °C, 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads was added to the mixture and incubated for another hour. The precipitates were washed and separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Recombinant FLAG epitope-tagged ADAMTS-1 proteins were prepared by COS-7 cell transient expression system, as described above. The expression was carried out in the serum-free DMEM for 2 days after transfection. An aliquot of the resultant culture supernatant containing ADAMTS-1 proteins was concentrated with Microcon-10 (Amicon) by about 5-fold, and 40 μl of concentrated sample was mixed with an equal volume of purified α2M solution (final concentration 0.25 units/ml) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 h. For some experiments, the culture supernatants were exchanged into the binding buffer (40 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 100 mmNaCl) by means of Microcon-10, and a binding reaction to α2M was carried out in the same binding buffer (α2M final concentration, 0.25 units/ml). The reactions were terminated with addition of an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and cross-linked products in α2M·ADAMTS-1 complexes were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody. ADAMTS-1 deletion mutant, X6 protein, was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, and the culture supernatant containing ADAMTS-1 proteins was concentrated with Microcon-10. Thereafter, proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After staining with Ponceau S, the band corresponding to the mature form of the X6 protein was excised, and its amino-terminal sequence was analyzed by Protein Sequencing System G1005A (Hewlett-Packard). The plasma protease inhibitor, α2M, has been shown to be capable of forming complexes with a wide variety of proteinases (20Feinman R.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 245-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Sottrup-Jensen L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Nagase H. Itoh Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Because the complex formation of proteinases with α2M is dependent on their proteolytic activities, the proteinase activity of the mouse ADAMTS-1 protein was determined based on its capacity to bind to α2M. For this purpose, recombinant ADAMTS-1 protein was prepared by means of the transient expression system in COS-7 cells. The FLAG epitope tag, consisting of nine amino acids, was added in the carboxyl terminus for the detection of the recombinant proteins. As shown in Fig.1 A, the full-length ADAMTS-1 protein was not secreted into the conditioned cell culture media (lanes 2 and 6), although the ADAMTS-1 is a secretory-type ADAM family protein. This is due to its binding property to the extracellular matrix (15Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Therefore, to obtain the soluble recombinant protein of ADAMTS-1, the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants, X4 and X5 (Fig. 2 A), lacking most of the ECM binding domains, were also expressed in the COS-7 cells. These carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants were released into the cell culture medium (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and4). The binding capacity of ADAMTS-1 to α2M was first addressed by the cell culture system in the presence of the serum containing α2M using soluble-type ADAMTS-1 proteins. Under serum-free conditions, ADAMTS-1 X4 and X5 proteins were present as both the precursor and processed forms in the culture supernatant (Fig.1 A, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, when mutants X4 and X5 were expressed under serum-containing conditions, high molecular weight species of these ADAMTS-1 proteins (complexes I and II) were detected in addition to their precursor and processed forms (lanes 7 and 8). Since the acrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out under denatured conditions, these complexes appeared to result from the covalent binding of the ADAMTS-1 protein to a certain serum protein. In addition, these high molecular complexes were very similar to α2M·proteinase complexes reported in other proteinases (20Feinman R.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 245-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Sottrup-Jensen L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Moreover, an immunoprecipitation experiment using anti-α2M antibodies (Fig. 1 B) revealed that high molecular weight complexes of ADAMTS-1 protein found in the COS-7 cell culture system resulted from the covalent binding of the ADAMTS-1 protein to α2M in serum.Figure 2A, schematic representation of the domain organization of ADAMTS-1 and the construction of its deletion mutants.

A non-conserved Asn residue of ADAMTS-1 within the zinc-binding motif is shaded.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine directly the capacity of ADAMTS-1 to bind to α2M, the recombinant ADAMTS-1 X5 mutant protein was first transiently expressed in COS-7 cells under the serum-free conditions, and the resultant culture supernatants containing the ADAMTS-1 protein were further used for the binding assay to the purified α2M. As shown in Fig.3 A, the high molecular weight species of mutant X5 (complexes I, and II), similar to those observed under the serum-containing conditions, were generated after incubation with the purified α2M (lane 5). This result indicates that the amino-terminal half of the ADAMTS-1 protein containing the metalloproteinase domain is capable of covalently binding to α2M and forming the high molecular weight complexes. The covalent binding of α2M to various proteinases has been shown to be initiated by the proteolytic cleavage of the bait region of α2M by proteinases (20Feinman R.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 245-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Sottrup-Jensen L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the involvement of the proteolysis of α2M, the effects of various protease inhibitors on the formation of the high molecular weight complexes were examined. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the ADAMTS-1·α2M complex formation was inhibited by the metalloproteinase inhibitors, EDTA and phenanthroline (lanes 2 and 3), whereas other protease inhibitors, leupeptin, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and pepstatin, did not (lane 4–7). These data suggest that ADAMTS-1 has an active metalloproteinase domain and that the metalloproteinase activity of this domain is required for the complex formation with α2M. Like other active ADAM metalloproteases such as TACE and KUZ, ADAMTS-1 possesses a potential zinc-binding motif (HEXXHXXXXXHD) in its metalloproteinase domain (Fig. 2 B). To confirm further whether the proteinase activity of ADAMTS-1 is required for the complex formation with α2M, an amino acid-substituted mutant was constructed within the zinc-binding motif. The mutant X5(E386Q), in which the essential Glu residue in the zinc-binding motif (HEXXH) was converted to Gln, can be expected to lose its zinc-binding capacity. When the X5(E386Q) mutant was expressed in COS-7 cells, the processed form of the protein was released into the culture supernatant at a level similar to that of X5 (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and 3). However, the high molecular weight species were not detected in the culture supernatant from the X5(E386Q)-transfected cells even under the serum-containing conditions (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). Consistent with this finding, the X5(E386Q) mutant lost its binding capacity to α2M in the binding assay (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). These results confirm that ADAMTS-1 is an active metalloproteinase and that a proteolytic cleavage of α2M is necessary for the ADAMTS-1·α2M complex formation. As described above, the ADAMTS-1 proteins were produced from COS-7 cells in both the precursor and processed forms. In addition, the mature forms of ADAMTS-1 deletion mutants, the X4 and X5, migrated as a doublet of bands on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A). To investigate the processing mechanism of the ADAMTS-1 precursor, we first addressed how these two mature forms were produced. Because the X4 and X5 deletion mutants have an N-linked glycosylation motif (Fig.2 A), the contribution of glycosylation to the generation of two different forms was examined by means of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation. As shown in Fig.5, the mature form of X4 proteins was detected as a doublet of bands under the normal growth conditions (lane 2). However, when X4 protein was expressed in the presence of tunicamycin, the upper band of the two mature forms completely disappeared, and only the lower band could be detected (Fig.5, lane 3). Consistent with this finding, the mature form of another deletion mutant, X6, which lacks an N-linked glycosylation motif (Fig. 2 A), was detected as a single band (Fig. 5, lane 4). These results clearly demonstrate that two mature forms of the X4 protein result from differential glycosylation and that the ADAMTS-1 precursor is processed at the single cleavage site. To examine further the processing mechanism, we next determined the partial amino-terminal sequence for the mature form of the X6 protein. The amino-terminal sequence of the mature X6 protein was FVSSPRYV and was located just after the furin recognition site (RKKR) (Fig.2 A). These results strongly suggest that the precursor of the ADAMTS-1 protein is processed by a furin endopeptidase. To assess this possibility, we further examined the processing of the ADAMTS-1 protein using a human colon carcinoma cell line, LoVo, that does not produce functional furin (24Takahashi S. Kasai K. Hatsuzawa K. Kitamura N. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). When the soluble type of the ADAMTS-1 protein, X5, was transiently expressed in LoVo cells, only the precursor form of the X5 protein was detected in the culture supernatant (Fig. 6, lane 2), suggesting that the processing of the ADAMTS-1 precursor is impaired in LoVo cells. Moreover, cotransfection of the mouse furin cDNA into LoVo cells resulted in the disappearance of the ADAMTS-1 X5 precursor and the appearance of its processed form (lane 3). In addition, a similar processing pattern was obtained when another deletion mutant of ADAMTS-1, X4, was expressed in LoVo cells (data not shown). These results indicate that the proprotein domain of the ADAMTS-1 precursor protein is proteolytically removed by furin endopeptidase in vivo. The present study has demonstrated that the proteinase domain of ADAMTS-1 is capable of forming a covalent complex with α2M. α2M is a plasma proteolytic enzyme inhibitor that binds various types of proteinases including serine proteases, cysteine proteases, and metalloproteases (20Feinman R.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 245-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Sottrup-Jensen L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Nagase H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The mechanism for the binding of proteinases to α2M is very unique. α2M contains a bait region in the middle of its peptide chain that provides a target for the proteinases (25Sottrup-Jensen L. Sand O. Kristensen L. Fey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15781-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bait region cleavage by proteinases triggers conformational changes in the α2M subunits that cause an encapsulation of the proteinases and the activation of internal thioesters of α2M, resulting in a covalent cross-linking of the active proteinases. Because the complex formation of proteinases with α2M is dependent on their proteolytic activities against the bait region, α2M is a useful tool for identifying unknown proteinases (22Nagase H. Itoh Y. Binner S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently, Loechel et al. (23Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) have reported that an ADAM family protein, meltrin α, is an active metalloproteinase by means of this trapping mechanism of α2M. In this study, we have also revealed that ADAMTS-1 possesses an active metalloproteinase domain based on its ability to form a covalent complex with α2M. The finding that the mutation of the zinc-binding motif of ADAMTS-1 eliminated its capacity to bind to α2M confirmed this notion. ADAM is a gene family that shows a sequence similarity to venom metalloproteinases such as hemorrhagic toxin (26Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 248: 345-368Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). An x-ray crystal structure analysis of venom metalloproteinases, adamalysin II and atrolysin C (HT-d), has revealed that these two metalloproteinases consist of a large main molecular body and a small subdomain (27Gomis-Rüth F.-X. Kress L.F. Bode W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4151-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 28Zhang D. Botos I. Gomis-Rüth F.-X. Doll R. Blood C. Njoroge F.G. Fox J.W. Bode W. Meyer E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8447-8451Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These two domains are separated by a long active site cleft with the catalytic zinc ion at its basement. The catalytic zinc in the active site cleft of the venom metalloproteinases is coordinated by three histidines of the zinc-binding motif (HEXXHXXGXXH), whereas the Met turn forms the basement of the zinc locus. Recently, Maskos et al. (29Maskos K. Fernandez-Catalan C. Huber R. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Ellestad G.A. Reddy P. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Castner B.J. Davis R. Clarke H.R.G. Petersen M. Fitzner J.N. Cerretti D.P. March C.J. Paxton R.J. Black R.A. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3408-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a catalytic zinc environment of TACE (ADAM17) resembles that of the snake venom metalloproteinases. Since ADAMTS-1 possesses a potential zinc-binding motif and retains the subsequent methionine residue that may function as a Met turn (Fig.2 B), a similar zinc-binding environment can be expected for ADAMTS-1. A sequence comparison of the active ADAM proteases with the snake venom metalloproteinases reveals a consensus sequence for the zinc-binding motif, HEXGHXXGXXHD. Furthermore, from analyses of a number of zinc endopeptidases including the snake venom metalloproteinases, astacin, serralysins, and matrix metalloproteinases, it appears that the zinc-binding motif is more generalized in HEXXHXXGXXH (30Stocher W. Ng M. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10418-10425Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Murphy G.J.P. Murphy G. Reynolds J.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 4-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 32Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). However, in the potential zinc-binding motif of ADAMTS-1, the Gly residue of the consensus sequence (HEXXHXXGXXH) is not conserved (Fig.2 B). Since the present study has revealed that ADAMTS-1 is an active metalloproteinase, it is likely that the conserved Gly residue of the zinc-binding motif is functionally interchangeable with Asn. Like matrix metalloproteinases and snake metalloproteinases, ADAMTS-1 possesses the conserved cysteine residue in the proprotein domain that may function to maintain the metalloproteinase domain in a latent state. Therefore, it is very important to investigate the processing mechanism of the ADAMTS-1 precursor for an understanding the regulatory mechanism of ADAMTS-1 protease. In the COS-7 cells expression system, the ADAMTS-1 proteins were produced as processed forms as well as precursor forms. One possibility is that partial proteolytic cleavage of the proprotein domain by other proteases may result in an autolytic activation of ADAMTS-1. However, in this study, we found that the processed form of ADAMTS-1 was still present in the COS-7 cells culture supernatant even when its metalloproteinase domain was inactivated by point mutation within the zinc-binding motif. This finding negates the possibility that the precursor form of the ADAMTS-1 protein is processed by an autolysis mechanism under COS-7 cell culture conditions. On the other hand, as described in our previous study (15Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), ADAMTS-1 possesses the typical furin recognition site (RX(K/R)R) (33Hatsuzawa K. Nagahama M.

Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the boundary between the proprotein and the metalloproteinase domains, as estimated by sequence alignment with the venom metalloproteinases. In this study, we have shown that the amino-terminal sequence of the mature ADAMTS-1 protein is located just after this furin recognition site. Furthermore, we have shown that the processing of the ADAMTS-1 precursor is impaired in LoVo cells deficient in furin and that the processing capacity of the cells is restored by the transfection of furin cDNA. These results provide evidence that the ADAMTS-1 precursor is proteolytically processed by furin in vivo. It was shown that several ADAM family proteins contain a consensus furin cleavage site between their pro-domain and metalloproteinase domains. Lum et al. (35Lum L. Reid M.S. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26236-26247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have reported that the pro-domain of MDC15 can be cleaved by a recombinant furin in vitro. But our study is the first report providing direct evidence that furin is involved in the processing of ADAM families in vivo. Furin is a serine endopeptidase in Golgi and cleaves a wide range of precursor proteins (33Hatsuzawa K. Nagahama M. Takahashi S. Takada K. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16094-16099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because furin is expressed in a wide variety of cells, our data implicate that the proprotein domain of the ADAMTS-1 protein is removed in the secretory pathway and that the proteolytically active form of the ADAMTS-1 protein is secreted from producing cells during inflammation. Our previous study showed that ADAMTS-1 is associated with ECM through multiple ECM-binding domains in its carboxyl-terminal region, whereas its metalloproteinase domain is free (15Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The present study has demonstrated that ADAMTS-1 has a functional proteinase domain. Taken collectively, ADAMTS-1 is an active ADAM protease that is associated with ECM. Further investigation is necessary to identify thein vivo substrate of ADAMTS-1 and to therefore provide understanding of the pathophysiological role of ADAMTS-1. But this study suggests that ADAMTS-1 may play a role in the inflammatory process through a processing of proteins that are present in the ECM. We are grateful to Dr. K. Nakayama (Tsukuba University) for providing the furin expression vector and to Dr. H. Sato (Kanazawa University) for providing LoVo cells and helpful discussion of this work."

In contrast, caveolin-1 forms high molecular mass homo-oligomers of ∼350 kDa (10Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1995; 6: 911-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been hypothesized that caveolin-2 molecules are embedded within or become tightly associated with high molecular mass homo-oligomers formed by caveolin-1 (9Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J. Kohtz D.S. van Donselaar E. Peters P. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

The genes encoding murine caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 are co-localized within the A2 region of mouse chromosome 6 (6-A2) (12Engelman J.A. Zhang X.L. Galbiati F. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). HumanCAV1 and CAV2 co-map to 7q31 in a region of conserved synteny with murine 6-A2 (13Engelman J.A. Zhang X.L. Lisanti M.P.

Similarly, the muscle-specific CAV3 gene is conserved both at the level of sequence and chromosomal context between mouse and human (4Engelman J.A. Zhang X.L. Galbiati F. Volonte D. Sotgia F.

The humanCAV3 gene, which underlies an autosomal dominant form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-1C), maps to 3p25, corresponding to the mouse region 6-E1 (12Engelman J.A. Zhang X.L. Galbiati F. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 15Minetti C. Sotogia F. Bruno C. Scartezzini P. Broda P. Bado M. Masetti E. Mazzocco P.

Given that caveolins-1 and -2 are co-expressed, that they form a hetero-oligomeric complex in vivo, and even their genes are co-localized to the same chromosomal region in mouse and human, it is apparent that this interaction is of vital importance. For example, in cells transformed by activated oncogenes, caveolin-1 levels are selectively down-regulated, but caveolin-2 levels remain relatively constant (9Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J. Kohtz D.S. van Donselaar E. Peters P. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29337-29346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In these cells, caveolae are not formed. In addition, targeted down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression using an antisense approach prevents caveolae formation, induces cell transformation, and produces a tumorigenic phenotype in NIH 3T3 cells (16Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Thus, it is either the absence of caveolin-1 or the presence of unbound caveolin-2 within these cells that is responsible for their transformed phenotype (16Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Furthermore, once caveolin-1 expression is restored in these cells, reconstituting the interaction between caveolins-1 and -2, their transformed phenotype is ablated (16Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar).

The locus of the presumed 7q31.1 tumor suppressor gene has been narrowed to a ∼1-megabase region that includes the highly polymorphic markerD7S522 (24Zenklusen J.C. Thompson J.C. Troncoso P. Kagan J.

Given the usefulness of 7q31.1 andD7S522 loss of heterozygosity as markers for carcinogenesis, many laboratories are currently searching this chromosomal region for a novel tumor suppressor gene. Recently, we have shown that the human caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 genes map within ∼100 kilobases ofD7S522, in the middle of the 1 megabase smallest common deleted region for the presumed tumor suppressor gene (4Engelman J.A.

Thus, we have proposed that the caveolin genes may represent the missing tumor suppressor genes at this locus (4Engelman J.A. Zhang X.L. Galbiati F. Volonte D. Sotgia F. Pestell R.G. Minetti C.

Despite the emerging importance of caveolins-1 and -2, little is known about the mechanism by which they form a hetero-oligomeric complexin vivo. Here, we have addressed this issue using a variety of complementary approaches. Our results indicate that complex formation between caveolins-1 and -2 is mediated by interactions between their respective membrane-spanning domains. This is the first demonstration that these unusual membrane-spanning regions play a critical role in specific protein-protein interactions. Antibodies and their sources were as follows: anti-caveolin-1 IgG (mAb 2234 and mAb 2297 (34Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Anti-fatty acyl CoA synthase IgG were the generous gift of Dr. Jean Schaffer (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). The blots containing caveolin-2-derived peptides (“peptides on paper”) were custom synthesized by Research Genetics. Other reagents were purchased commercially: fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences); prestained protein markers (Life Technologies, Inc.). All other biochemicals used were of the highest purity available and obtained from regular commercial sources. An oligo(dT)-primed, random-primed mouse adipocyte cDNA library in the vector pcDNA1 (35Baldini G. Hohl T. Lin H. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Library screening was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Positive clones were characterized by restriction digestion and sequencing. The clone with the longest 5′-end contained an ∼2.3-kilobase cDNA insert and was completely sequenced. This insert contained the complete coding sequence of murine caveolin-2. The murine caveolin-2 cDNA construct and vector alone were transiently expressed in Cos-7 cells using the DEAE-dextran method (9Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J.

Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were scraped into lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm octyl-glucoside). Cell extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using a specific caveolin-2 mAb probe. All DNA manipulations, including ligations, bacterial transformation, and plasmid purification were carried out using standard procedures. Myc epitope-tagged forms of caveolins-1 and -3 in the mammalian expression vector pCB7 were as described previously (34Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Briefly, Myc-tagged forms of caveolin-1 and untagged caveolin-2 (∼10–20 μg of DNA) were transiently transfected into Cos-7 cells using the DEAE-dextran method. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were scraped into lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm octyl-glucoside). Myc-tagged forms of caveolin-1 were immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody, 9E10, that recognizes the Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDLN). Immunoprecipitates were washed with washing buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (13% acrylamide) followed by Western blotting using antibodies directed against caveolin-2 to detect hetero-oligomer formation. 3T3-L1 murine fibroblasts (ATCC) were propagated in 10-cm dishes and differentiated to the adipoctye form according to conventional protocols (38Scherer P.E.

Day 6 adipocytes were subjected to metabolic labeling with35S-labeled methionine and cysteine in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (methionine and cysteine-free) for a 10-min pulse. The cells were then chased for 0, 10, 30 or 60 min with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 300 μmcycloheximide, to prevent further protein synthesis. Cells were scraped into lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm octyl-glucoside) and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Extracts were first immunoprecipitated with anti-caveolin-1 IgG (mAb 2234) bound to protein A-Sepharose. After washing the beads with washing buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100), bound proteins were eluted with 1% SDS, 20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100. Half of the eluate was then diluted to a final concentration of 0.1% SDS with washing buffer and was re-immunoprecipitated with anti-caveolin-2 IgG. The resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography. Estimation of the molecular mass of caveolin-1 and -2 was performed essentially as described previously (9Scherer P.E.

Briefly, cells were scraped into 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm octyl-glucoside, and the soluble extracts were loaded atop a 5–20% sucrose density gradient and subjected to centrifugation for 4 h at 100,000 rpm in a Beckman TLS-55 rotor. After centrifugation, gradient fractions were collected from the top. Molecular mass standards for velocity gradient centrifugation were as follows: carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa; alcohol dehydrogenase, 150 kDa; β-amylase, 200 kDa; apoferritin, 443 kDa (Sigma). GST-caveolin-1 fusion proteins were constructed and purified as we described previously (10Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Briefly, regions of caveolin-1 were subcloned into the MCS of the vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and expressed in a suitableEscherichia coli strain (BL21, lacking lon and ompT proteases; Novagen, Inc.). GST-caveolin-1 fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-agarose (41Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). The purified proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with 3T3-L1 adipocyte extracts. After binding, the beads were washed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting with anti-caveolin-2 IgG. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. After transfer, nitrocellulose sheets were stained with Ponceau S to visualize protein bands and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-caveolin-1 IgG (mAb 2297; 1:400) or anti-caveolin-2 IgG (mAb 65; 1:1000). Incubation conditions were as described by the manufacturer (Promega; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), except we supplemented our blocking solution with 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% nonfat dry milk (Carnation). Peptide blots (peptides on paper) containing a panel of peptides derived from the protein sequence of murine caveolin-2 were custom made by Research Genetics. Peptides were designed so that each peptide is 10 amino acids in length, and each pair of consecutive peptides overlaps by 5 amino acids. The caveolin-2 peptide blot was incubated with radioiodinated GST-caveolin-1 for ∼18 h at 4 °C, washed thoroughly with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, and subjected to autoradiography. Purified GST-caveolin-1 fusion proteins were radioiodinated using the chloramine-T method (42Greenwood F.C. Hunter W.M. Glever J.S. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (6739) Google Scholar). Prior to labeling, GST-caveolin-1 fusion proteins were dialyzed against 20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20. Approximately 50–100 μg of protein was radioiodinated with 1 mCi of Na125I in presence of 20 μg of chloramine-T for 5 min at room temperature. After terminating the reaction with unlabeled NaI, the labeled proteins were separated from free 125I using a G-25 column. Caveolin-2-derived polypeptides were synthesized directly onto an activated polymeric membrane by Research Genetics. The peptide chemistry was standard Fmoc with coupling mediated through HOBt/DIC and Fmoc removal with 1:3 piperidine/DMF. For final peptide protecting group removal, the membrane was placed in a bath of 50:47.5:2.5:1.5:1 DCM/TFA/thioanisole/EDT/anisole for 1 h and finally washed and dried. These sheets were probed by immunoblotting with anti-caveolin-2 IgG or with radioiodinated GST-caveolin-1 as described above. The membrane-spanning domain of caveolin-1 (residues 102–134) fused to GST was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a previously constructed GST fusion construct as the template. This polymerase chain reaction product then was subcloned into the pCB7 vector downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter and termed pGST-Cav-1-MS. pGST-Cav-1-MS was co-transfected with (i) N-terminally Myc-tagged caveolin-1 and (ii) untagged caveolin-2 in Cos-7 cells using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Inc), as per the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours posttransfection, cells were scraped into lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm octyl-glucoside). Myc-tagged caveolin-1 was immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody 9E10, which recognizes the Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDLN). Immunoprecipitates were washed with washing buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting using anti-caveolin-2 IgG. The full-length cDNA for mouse caveolin-2 was cloned by screening a day 8 3T3-L1 adipocyte library. Twenty-two individual clones were analyzed and characterized by restriction digestion/DNA sequencing. The clone with the longest 5′-end contained a 2.3-kilobase cDNA fragment and was completely sequenced. This 2.3-kilobase insert contained the complete coding sequence of murine caveolin-2 and has been deposited in GenBankTM under accession number AF141322. Only the cDNAs for human and canine caveolin-2 have been previously cloned (9Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J. Kohtz D.S. van Donselaar E. Peters P. Lisanti M.P.

Electron density profiles generated from the x-ray diffraction data demonstrated that soluble and aggregated Aβ1–40 peptides associated with distinct regions of the SPM. The width of the SPM samples, including surface hydration, was 84 Å at 10 °C. Following addition of soluble Aβ1–40, there was a broad increase in electron density in the SPM hydrocarbon core ±0–15 Å from the membrane center, and a reduction in hydrocarbon core width by 6 Å. By contrast, aggregated Aβ1–40 contributed electron density to the phospholipid headgroup/hydrated surface of the SPM ±24–37 Å from the membrane center, concomitant with an increase in molecular volume in the hydrocarbon core. The SPM interactions observed for Aβ1–40 were reproduced in a brain lipid membrane system. In contrast to Aβ1–40, aggregated Aβ1–42intercalated into the lipid bilayer hydrocarbon core ±0–12 Å from the membrane center. Fluorescence experiments showed that both soluble and aggregated Aβ1–40 significantly increased SPM bulk and protein annular fluidity.

Following addition of soluble Aβ1–40, there was a broad increase in electron density in the SPM hydrocarbon core ±0–15 Å from the membrane center, and a reduction in hydrocarbon core width by 6 Å. By contrast, aggregated Aβ1–40 contributed electron density to the phospholipid headgroup/hydrated surface of the SPM ±24–37 Å from the membrane center, concomitant with an increase in molecular volume in the hydrocarbon core. The SPM interactions observed for Aβ1–40 were reproduced in a brain lipid membrane system. In contrast to Aβ1–40, aggregated Aβ1–42intercalated into the lipid bilayer hydrocarbon core ±0–12 Å from the membrane center. Fluorescence experiments showed that both soluble and aggregated Aβ1–40 significantly increased SPM bulk and protein annular fluidity. Physico-chemical interactions of Aβ with the neuronal membrane may contribute to mechanisms of neurotoxicity, independent of specific receptor binding. Alzheimer's disease (AD) 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer's disease; Aβ, amyloid β-peptide; SPM, synaptic plasma membranes; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer's disease; Aβ, amyloid β-peptide; SPM, synaptic plasma membranes; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of neuritic plaques composed of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) variants, extracellular matrix components, and apolipoproteins (1Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar, 2Roher A.E. Palmer K.C. Yurewicz E.C. Ball M.J. Greenberg B.D. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1916-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Aβ is an amphipathic, 39–42-residue peptide that is derived by proteolytic cleavage of the transmembrane glycoprotein, the amyloid precursor protein; the Aβ domain is composed of 28 extracellular and 12–14 transmembrane amino acid residues of amyloid precursor protein (3Selkoe D.J.

An increase in the production and abnormal accumulation of Aβ in the brain has been implicated in the etiology of AD. Several studies have shown that Aβ analogs can directly disrupt neuronal function, contributing to cell death associated with the development of AD (4Harris M.E. Wang Y. Pedigo Jr., N.W. Hensley K.

It has been postulated that the biological activity of Aβ is related to its ability to form insoluble aggregates in solution (9Cotman C.W. Pike C.J. Copani A. Neurobiol.

This finding suggests that Aβ modulates membrane function by a nonreceptor-mediated mechanism, potentially as a result of altering the physico-chemical properties of membrane constituents, including lipids and proteins (13Muller W.E.

Indeed, previous membrane equilibrium binding experiments have demonstrated that the Aβ25–35 fragment is highly lipophilic (K P > 102); the peptide intercalates deep into the membrane bilayer hydrocarbon core, as determined by small angle x-ray diffraction approaches (15Mason R.P. Estermyer J.D. Kelly J.F. Mason P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, aggregated Aβ1–40 has strong electrostatic interactions with the surface of model membranes that appear to mediate its neurotoxicity (17Hertel C. Terzi E. Hauser N. Jakob-Rotne R. Seelig J. Kemp J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9412-9416Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It was also reported that soluble Aβ1–40 has pronounced effects on the molecular anisotropy properties of rat SPM samples, consistent with peptide-induced changes in the conformation of membrane lipid constituents (14Avdulov N.A. Chochina S.V. Igbavboa U. O'Hare E.O. Schroeder F. Cleary J.P. Wood W.G. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2086-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this study, the effects of aggregated and soluble Aβ on membrane structure and lipid dynamics were evaluated using a combination of small angle x-ray diffraction and fluorescence spectroscopy approaches. X-ray diffraction analyses were utilized to compare the molecular structures of reconstituted and intact neuronal membranes following the addition of soluble versus aggregated Aβ (Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42). In parallel experiments, fluorescence spectroscopy techniques were carried out using pyrene as a fluorescent probe to quantify the effects of Aβ on both bulk and annular lipid fluidity. The results of these experiments provide new insights into the physico-chemical interactions of Aβ with neuronal membranes as a function of the peptide aggregation state. Aβ1–40 (lot ZN571) and Aβ1–42 (lot ZN327) were purchased from Bachem California (Torrance, CA). The silver staining kit was from Bio-Rad. Benzo [def]phenanthrene (pyrene; P-2146) and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Porcine brain phosphatidylcholine was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The fatty acid composition of the brain phosphatidylcholine lipids included: 16:0 (30%), 18:1 (30%), 18:0 (14%), 18:2 (9%), 20:4 (6%), and 22:6 (3%), as determined by gas-liquid chromatographic analysis. The overall ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids was 0.8:1. Synaptic plasma membranes (SPM) were isolated from F344 male rats (3 months old) using discontinuous Ficoll-sucrose gradients as described previously (14Avdulov N.A. Chochina S.V. Igbavboa U.

The homogenate was centrifuged at 578 × g for 8 min, and the supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 17,300 × g for 10 min. The resulting pellet (P2) was suspended in sucrose buffer and then layered over 7.5 and 13% Ficoll solutions (w/v Ficoll/sucrose buffer) containing 0.5 mm EDTA. The gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW 28 rotor at 80,000 × g for 30 min. The material at the 7.5 and 13% interfaces was carefully removed, and sucrose buffer was added and centrifuged at 17,300 × g for 15 min. The pellet enriched in synaptosomes was resuspended in sucrose buffer and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. SPM were prepared by lysing synaptosomes in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The synaptosomal suspension was kept on ice (4 °C) and vortexed every 20 min for 1 h. The suspension was then centrifuged at 41,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of cold distilled water and underlayered with 15 ml of 0.75m sucrose buffer containing 1.5 mm Tris, 3 mm HEPES, 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 41,000 × g for 30 min. SPM at the interface were removed and pelleted at 41,000 × g for 20 min. The SPM pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 in 1.0 ml of distilled water were individually incubated for 0 and 48 h in darkness with continuous stirring at 37 °C. The peptide aggregates formed were mixed with glycerol and separated with 11.5% nondenaturing gels. The following protein reference standards were used: aprotinin, α-lactalbumin, trypsin inhibitor, carbonic anhydrase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, egg albumin, and bovine albumin. The gels were run at 70 min at constant amperage (60 mA/gel) using Bio-Rad Powerpac 200. Bands were visualized using silver staining. Optical density and molecular weights were determined using Eagle Eye II video system and EagleSight software (version 3.2). Porcine brain phosphatidylcholine lipids dissolved in chloroform (1.0 mg/ml) were dried down under a stream of nitrogen gas to a thin film in a test tube while vortexing. Residual solvent was removed by drying for 3 h under a vacuum. A 1.0-ml aliquot of buffer (0.5 mm HEPES, 154.0 mm NaCl, pH 7.3) containing a specified concentration of Aβ1–40 or Aβ1–42 was added to the dried lipid to yield a final protein:lipid mass ratio of 1:10. SPM or reconstituted brain multilamellar vesicles prepared in the presence and absence of Aβ for x-ray diffraction analysis were oriented by centrifugation. The membrane suspensions were centrifuged in a Sorvall AH-629 swinging bucket ultracentrifuge rotor (DuPont) at 35,000 × gfor 90 min at 5 °C in Lucite sedimentation cells, each containing an aluminum foil substrate (25Herbette L. DeFoor P. Fleischer S. Pascolini D. Scarpa A. Blasie J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 817: 103-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For these experiments, 250 μg of phospholipid was used for each sample. The mole ratio of Aβ1–40 to phospholipid in the samples was 1:23 for the SPM samples and 1:55 for the reconstituted brain membrane samples. These ratios were selected based on previous analyses with shorter Aβ fragments (15Mason R.P. Estermyer J.D. Kelly J.F. Mason P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and designed to produce detectable differences in electron density. Following centrifugation, the supernatants were removed, and each membrane multilayer pellet was mounted on a curved glass support and suspended overnight in a humidity chamber containing a saturated salt solution. The oriented membrane samples were then placed in sealed brass canisters with thin aluminum foil windows in which temperature and relative humidity were controlled (as described above). The oriented SPM samples were aligned at near-grazing incidence with respect to a collimated x-ray beam. The radiation source was a monochromatic x-ray (CuKα x-ray, λ = 1.54 Å) from a Rigaku RU-200 high brilliance rotating anode x-ray generator (Rigaku USA, Danvers, MA). The diffraction data were collected on both a one-dimensional position-sensitive electronic detector (Innovative Technologies, Inc., Newburyport, MA) and two-dimensional PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) plate. The sample-to-detector distance was 150 mm. Each individual diffraction peak used for the x-ray diffraction analysis was background-corrected using a linear subtraction routine that averaged the noise. The intensities used for these analyses were at least 3 orders of magnitude above background noise. At least six separate x-ray diffraction experiments were conducted for membranes prepared in the absence and presence of solubleversus aggregated Aβ analogs. The lamellar intensity functions from the oriented membrane samples were corrected by a factor of s = 2sinθ/λ, the Lorentz correction, in which λ is the wavelength of the x-ray radiation (1.54 Å), and θ is the Bragg angle equal to one-half of the angle between the incident beam and the scattered beam. A swelling analysis was used to assign unambiguous phases to the experimental structure factors (26Moody M.F. Science. 1963; 142: 1173-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). An SLM 8100 fluorimeter (Spectronics Inc., Rochester, NY) was used to determine SPM annular and bulk fluidity using procedures previously reported by our laboratory (14Avdulov N.A. Chochina S.V. Igbavboa U. O'Hare E.O. Schroeder F. Cleary J.P. Wood W.G. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2086-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Avdulov N.A. Wood W.G. Harris R.A. Alcohol. Clin. Exp.

The pyrene excimer/monomer fluorescence intensities ratio when pyrene was excited through energy transfer from tryptophans on SPM proteins (excitation = 286 nm) and when pyrene was excited at its own excitation wavelength (excitation = 334 nm) were used to calculate annular fluidity and bulk fluidity, respectively. Fluorimeter cuvette temperature was maintained at 36.5 °C with a circulating water bath. Band pass slits were 8 nm on excitation and 4 nm on emission. Pyrene emission spectra were recorded in a 350–500-nm interval. SPM were suspended in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 6.5 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 20 mmHEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with Tris base) that served as the control buffer or PBS containing Aβ1–40 that had been incubated for 0 or 48 h. SPM (50 μg of protein) were added to PBS control buffer or PBS containing Aβ1–40 and were incubated for 30 min in a thermostated water bath at 36.5 °C with continuous shaking in darkness. Samples were then transferred to a 1.0-ml quartz cuvette and placed in a thermostated cuvette chamber. Pyrene (10−5m in 1.0 μl of 10−2m solution in dimethylformamide) was added to the sample at the rate of 1.0 μl/min with constant stirring. Pyrene was then excited 1 min later through energy transfer from tryptophan (excitation = 286 nm), and fluorescence emission spectra of pyrene were recorded. Considering that the Forster radius (the energy transfer-limiting distance) for the tryptophan-pyrene donor-acceptor pair is 3 nm (27Tahara Y. Murata M. Ohnishi S. Fujiyoshi Y. Kikuchi M. Yamamoto Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8747-8754Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), only pyrene located in the annular lipid (adjacent to proteins) was excited, and the fluidity of the annular lipid was considered proportional to the ratioF e /F m , whereF e and F m are the fluorescence intensities of pyrene eximer (emission = 480 nm) and monomer (emission = 373 nm), respectively. Pyrene was then excited at 334 nm, and the bulk fluidity was considered to be proportional to the ratio F e /F m obtained with the 334-nm excitation wavelength. The effects of Aβ on membrane structure were evaluated following the addition of freshly solubilized and preincubated (48 h) peptide. Fig. 1 shows that incubation of Aβ1–42 (Panel A) and Aβ1–40 (Panel B) for a 48-h period produced peptide aggregation, as determined by gel electrophoresis. However, the distribution of the molecular weights of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 were quite different. Dimers, trimers, and polymers were observed for Aβ1–40 that had been incubated for 48 h (Fig. 1 B). Approximately 44% of Aβ1–40 that had been incubated for 48 h was in a dimeric form. Dimers of Aβ1–40 (10%) were also noted immediately following peptide solubilization, but trimers and polymers were not detected. Distribution of Aβ1–42 revealed monomeric and tetrameric forms (Fig. 1 A); a 48 h incubation of Aβ1–42 resulted in 74% of the peptide as a tetramer, whereas the 0-h incubation showed only 11% of the peptide as a tetramer. Small angle x-ray diffraction data from oriented SPM samples produced five strong, reproducible diffraction orders at 10 °C (Fig. 2 A). The unit cell periodicity, or d space (the distance from the center of one membrane to the next, including surface hydration), for the control was 85.2 ± 0.3 Å. Following addition of soluble Aβ1–40 or aggregated Aβ1–40 at a peptide to phospholipid mole ratio of 1:23, the d space values were reduced to 77.9 ± 0.3 and 75.1 ± 0.3 Å, respectively. One-dimensional electron density profiles generated from the diffraction data by Fourier analysis indicated a centrosymmetric membrane bilayer structure. The primary reason for a centrosymmetric structure is that the stacking of the membranes results in a random orientation for the SPM with respect to the multilayer direction. The SPM electron density profiles were normalized to the phospholipid headgroup region, a region of relatively high electron density, after applying identical correction factors to the raw diffraction data (28Young H.S. Skita V. Mason R.P. Herbette L.G. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 1244-1255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,29Mason R.P. Gonye G.E. Chester D.W. Herbette L.G. Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 769-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Direct subtraction of the normalized SPM membrane electron density profiles demonstrated pronounced changes in structure following the addition of soluble versus aggregated Aβ1–40(Figs. 3 and4). The addition of soluble Aβ1–40 produced a broad increase in electron density ±0–16 Å from the center of the membrane concomitant with a 5 Å reduction in the intrabilayer headgroup separation from 51 Å to 46 Å. The large increase in electron density associated with the center of the membrane suggests that soluble Aβ1–40 intercalates deep into the membrane hydrocarbon core, a region containing hydrophobic, phospholipid acyl chains. As a result of disrupting the intermolecular packing of membrane phospholipid acyl chains, the overall membrane width was effectively reduced by Aβ1–40. Similar changes in membrane width have been observed as a function of disordering the membrane hydrocarbon core by either reducing membrane cholesterol content or increasing the sample thermal energy (30Mason R.P. Trumbore M.W. Pettegrew J.W. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Chen M. Mason R.P. Tulenko T.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1272: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The addition of soluble Aβ1–40also produced a reduction in peak width at half-maximum corresponding to the phospholipid headgroup region by 2 Å. This finding indicates that the motion of the phospholipid headgroup is more restricted in the presence of soluble Aβ1–40, as compared with control SPM samples.Figure 4A, superimposed one-dimensional electron density profiles for reconstituted porcine brain phospholipid bilayer samples in the absence (solid line) and presence (dashed line) of soluble Aβ1–40. The d space values for the samples were 52.8 Å (control) and 53.6 Å (soluble Aβ1–40) at 10 °C. The mole ratio of Aβ1–42 to phospholipid was 1:55. B, superimposed one-dimensional electron density profiles for reconstituted porcine brain phospholipid bilayer samples in the absence (solid line) and presence (dashed line) of aggregated Aβ1–40. The d space values for the samples were 52.8 Å (control) and 55.5 Å (aggregated Aβ1–40) at 10 °C. The mole ratio of Aβ1–40 to phospholipid was 1:55.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The addition of aggregated Aβ1–40 to SPM samples produced changes in membrane structure that were distinct from those observed with soluble Aβ1–40. Instead of an increase in electron density associated with the membrane hydrocarbon core, a marked decrease in electron density was observed throughout this region of the membrane following the addition of aggregated Aβ1–40. Aggregated Aβ1–40 also produced a broad increase in electron density associated with the SPM phospholipid headgroup and hydrated surface ±25–36 Å from the center of the membrane. These differences in electron density suggest that aggregated Aβ1–40 is associated primarily with the hydrated surface of the SPM samples, as opposed to the phospholipid acyl chains. Moreover, the presence of Aβ1–40 in this region of the membrane can effect a reorganization in the hydrocarbon core acyl chains, resulting in increased molecular volume, as evidenced by the decrease in hydrocarbon core electron density. These changes in membrane structure associated with the addition of either soluble or aggregated Aβ1–40 were observed over a broad range of temperature (10–40 °C) and relative humidity levels (72–93%). Small angle x-ray diffraction data from oriented SPM samples produced four strong, reproducible diffraction orders (Fig.2 B). The interactions of soluble and aggregated Aβ analogs with lipid vesicles reconstituted from brain phosphatidylcholine were determined by using small angle x-ray diffraction approaches. Despite the fact that protein was not present in these vesicles, the molecular locations of soluble and aggregated Aβ1–40 peptide were in large part similar to that observed for the intact SPM preparation (Figs. 5 and6). The unit cell periodicity, ord space, for the control brain lipid bilayer was 52.8 ± 0.3 Å at 20 °C. Following addition of soluble or aggregated Aβ1–40 at a peptide to phospholipid mole ratio of 1:55, the d space values were 53.6 ± 0.3 and 55.5 ± 0.3 Å, respectively. One-dimensional electron density profiles generated from the diffraction data indicated a centrosymmetric membrane structure, as predicted for a model lipid bilayer preparation. In the presence of soluble Aβ1–40, there was a broad increase in electron density associated with the hydrocarbon core ±0–18 Å from the center of the membrane. The addition of aggregated Aβ1–40 to the reconstituted brain membranes produced distinct changes in electron density. Specifically, the addition of soluble Aβ1–40 produced an increase in electron density associated with the glycerol backbone/phospholipid head group region of the lipid bilayer, extending ±11–27 Å from the center of the membrane. The addition of aggregated Aβ1–40 effected a broad reduction in electron density associated with the membrane hydrocarbon core (±0–10 Å), similar to that observed with the SPM samples. By contrast, aggregated Aβ1–42 had different interactions with the membrane lipid vesicles when compared with Aβ1–40. Both soluble and aggregated forms of Aβ1–42 contributed electron density only to the membrane hydrocarbon core over a broad region extending ±0–12 Å from the membrane center (Fig. 5) and had no effect on overall membrane width ord space. The effect of Aβ on membrane structure was dose-dependent.Figure 6Effects of solubleAβ1–40 on tryptophan and pyrene fluorescence in SPM . Lines a and b, SPM endogenous tryptophan in the absence or presence of 10−6m Aβ1–40. Line c, SPM endogenous tryptophans and pyrene in the absence of Aβ1–40. Line d, SPM endogenous tryptophans and pyrene in the presence of 10−6mAβ1–40. The eximer/monomer fluorescence ratio (F c/F m) for pyrene when the probe was excited through energy transfer from SPM tryptophan was used as an indicator of annular fluidity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Annular fluidity and bulk membrane fluidity were determined by using the excimer/monomer fluorescence intensity ratio of the fluorescent probe pyrene. Annular fluidity was measured when pyrene was excited through radiationless energy transfer from SPM proteins containing tryptophan (excitation = 286 nm). Bulk fluidity was determined when pyrene was excited at 334 nm. The fluorescence intensity of SPM endogenous tryptophans is shown in Fig. 6(line a); this fluorescence intensity was markedly decreased when pyrene was added (Fig. 6, line b). The observed reduction in fluorescence intensity of tryptophan in the 330–350 nm wavelength interval was due to energy transfer from tryptophan to pyrene (excitation = 334 nm). The result of energy transfer was the observation of maximas of pyrene monomers in the wavelength interval 370–400 nm and a hill-shaped portion of the spectra with a maxima typical for the pyrene excimer at 480 nm. The ratio of intensities associated with the pyrene excimer at 480 nm and pyrene monomer at 373 nm was used to calculate annular fluidity when pyrene was excited through energy transfer from SPM tryptophans (Fig. 6). There was a large increase in the pyrene excimer fluorescence intensity at 480 nm with little if any effect on the fluorescence intensity of pyrene monomer at 373 nm when Aβ1–40 was added to the SPM samples (Fig. 6, line c). The means ± S.E. (F e/F m) of annular fluidity of the control SPM and SPM incubated with soluble Aβ1–40 were 0.435 ± 0.012 and 0.474 ± 0.014, respectively, and were significantly different (p ≤ 0.01). Aβ1–40 that had been incubated for 48 h prior to being added to SPM also significantly (p ≤ 0.01) increased annular fluidity (F e /F m = 0.467 ± 0.009). When pyrene that had partitioned into SPM was excited at 334 nm, the fluorescence intensity of the maximas was increased as compared with pyrene excited through energy transfer (Figs. 6 and7). This large difference in fluorescence intensity indicated that the fraction of pyrene in close proximity to SPM proteins containing tryptophan contributed very little to the estimation of bulk fluidity. The ratio of intensity of pyrene excimer fluorescence intensity at 480 nm to fluorescence intensity of pyrene monomer at 373 nm was used for the estimation of bulk fluidity when pyrene was excited at 334 nm. When soluble Aβ1–40 was added to SPM, there was a marked increase in pyrene excimer fluorescence intensity at 480 nm with no effect on the fluorescence intensity of pyrene monomer at 373 nm (Fig. 7). The means ± S.E. of bulk fluidity of the control SPM and SPM + Aβ1–40were 0.448 ± 0.009 and 0.477 ± 0.008, respectively, and were significantly different (p ≤ 0.01). Bulk fluidity of SPM was also significantly (p ≤ 0.01) increased by Aβ1–40 that had been incubated for 48 h prior to being added to SPM (F e /F m= 0.469 ± 0.006).

We have determined that PTHrP localizes to the nucleus at the G1 phase of the cell cycle and is transported to the cytoplasm when cells divide. PTHrP contains a putative nuclear localization sequence (NLS) (residues 61–94) similar to that of SV40 T-antigen, which may be implicated in the nuclear import of the molecule. We identified that Thr85immediately prior to the NLS of PTHrP was phosphorylated by CDC2-CDK2 and phosphorylation was cell cycle-dependent. Mutation of Thr85 to Ala85 resulted in nuclear accumulation of PTHrP, while mutation to Glu85 to mimic a phosphorylated residue resulted in localization of PTHrP to the cytoplasm. Combined, the data demonstrate that the intracellular localization of PTHrP is phosphorylation- and cell cycle-dependent, and such control further supports a potential intracellular role (10Lam M.H.C.

However, its intracellular roles have not been fully defined. Recently a nucleolar localization signal (NLS) was identified within PTHrP and deletion of this motif prevented PTHrP from entering the nucleolus, maintaining it as a cytoplasmic protein (4Henderson J.E.

Furthermore, PTHrP localizes to the nucleolus at the G1 phase of the cell cycle (10Lam M.H.C. Olsen S.L. Rankin W.A. Ho P.W.M. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T. Moseley J.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cyclin-dependent kinases control the progression of the various phases of the cell cycle (11Norbury C. Nurse P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 441-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CDKs are activated at different phases of the cell cycle by the formation of cyclin-CDK complex and deactivated when their cyclin partner is degraded. The prototype CDK is CDC2, which associates with cyclin B and regulates the transition between the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. Cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2 complexes are involved in the G1to S transition, while CDK4 and CDK6 associating with the D-type cyclins are involved in the progression through G1 (12Pines J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). In addition to direct regulation of the cell cycle, cyclins and CDKs have functions in other biological processes such as transcriptional control (13Poon R.Y.C. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1243-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and protein phosphorylation by CDC2 and CDK2 results in increase of affinity for the cytoplasm of some molecules containing an NLS (14Jans D.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A stretch of basic residues, or a pair of basic residues separated by a 10–12 amino acid spacer to form a bipartite NLS, characterizes NLSs. The archetypal protein used in nuclear localization studies is the SV40 T-antigen where nuclear/cytoplasmic localization is regulated by phosphorylation. CK2 and/or CDC2-CDK2 phosphorylations at sites near the NLS determine the rate and amount of localization within the nucleus in an NLS-dependent manner (15Rihs H.-P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 16Jans D.A. Ackermann M.J. Bischoff J.R. Beach D.H. Peters R. J.

The combination of a CK2 site, a CDC2-CDK2 site and an NLS constitute a CcN motif, which is involved in phosphorylation-regulated nuclear localization. The CcN motif is conserved in a number of nuclear localized proteins, including mammalian c-MYC, p53, and mouse c-ABL IV and A-MYB (14Jans D.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 18Jans D.A. Hübner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 652-658Crossref Scopus (389) Google Scholar). PTHrP contains a putative CcN motif similar to SV40 T-antigen, consisting of a CK2 site, and a CDC2-CDK2 site immediately before the NLS (Fig. 2). Additionally, a putative nucleolar targeting sequence (NoS) is located immediately C-terminal to the NLS. In the present work using overexpressing cells, PTHrP was found to be phosphorylated in vivo. Using in vitro assays cyclin E-CDK2, cyclin A-CDK2 and cyclin B-CDC2 phosphorylated PTHrP at Thr85, which is immediately prior to its NLS. With the use of wild type and mutant green fluorescent protein GFP-PTHrP fusion proteins overexpressed in HaCaT cells, it was found that phosphorylation of Thr85 resulted in cytoplasmic retention/nuclear exclusion. The results of these studies indicate a cell cycle-dependent nuclear exclusion of PTHrP from the start of S phase to mitosis, providing support for a tightly regulated nuclear function for PTHrP at G1. The spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, which expresses PTHrP, was a kind gift from Professor N. E. Fusenig and was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C and equilibrated with 5% CO2, as described previously (19Heath J.K. Southby J. Fukumoto S. O'Keeffe L.M. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The human T lymphoid cell line (CEM) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. 70% confluent HaCaT cells fixed and stained with a fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibody against amino terminus PTHrP as described previously (10Lam M.H.C.

Moseley J.M. Martin T.J. Bone (N. Y.). 1995; 16: 205SGoogle Scholar). The cells were counter-stained with the nuclei acid-specific dye, propidium iodide. Images were collected and generated on a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM; Bio-Rad MRC 1024, Bio-Rad Microscopy Division, Hemel Hempstead Herts, United Kingdom). The histidine-tagged protein A-bovine cyclin A complimentary DNA (cDNA) in a pET16b vector and the human p34CDK2 cDNA in pGEX was a generous gift from Dr. T. Hunt (ICRF Clare Hall Laboratories, UK). GST-p34CDK2 and histidine-tagged protein A-cyclin A were overexpressed inEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) purified and activated as described in Poon et al. (21Poon R.Y.C. Yamashita K. Adamczewski P. Hunt T. Shuttleworth J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3123-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Alternatively, cDNAs for CDK2, cyclin A (gifts from Dr. Tony Hunter, The Salk Institute, San Diego, CA) and cyclin E (a gift from Dr. Steven Reed, The Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and individually cloned into the baculoviral transfer vector pVL1329 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Cyclins E and A were cloned with an N-terminal GST cassette, and the CDK2 was cloned with an N-terminal 6-histidine tag. The sequences of all final constructs were confirmed by dideoxy chain termination sequencing analysis. Viruses were generated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.) and SF9 insect cells were infected with high titer baculoviral cyclin and CDK stocks. Following infection for 3 days, the cells were harvested, lysed, and active cyclin-CDK complexes purified using glutathione affinity chromatography. Recombinant baculoviruses for human GST-cyclin B and CDC2 were a kind gift from Dr. Helen Piwnica-Worms (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) and were expressed and purified as described above. Protein kinase assays were performed in a buffer containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.25 mm[γ-32P]ATP (500 cpm/pmol), 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80, and varying concentrations of substrate and diluted enzyme (5 μg/ml final concentration) made up to 40 μl total volume. The enzyme was diluted in a buffer containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The reactions were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C, then 20 μl of the reaction mixture spotted onto Whatman P-81 paper, washed and dried, and then quantitated as described in Pearson et al. (22Pearson R.B. Mitchelhill K.I. Kemp B.E. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation-A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 265-291Google Scholar). For comparison of PTHrP phosphorylation by various cyclin-CDK combinations (Table I) and kinetic studies (Table II), 10 μl of varying concentrations of PTHrP and 10 μl of appropriately diluted cyclin-CDKs were added together. Reactions were initialized by 50 mm HEPES, pH 7, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm MgCl2, 750 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. All reactions were performed at 30 °C. For the cyclin-CDK comparison studies, 1 μg of PTHrP-(50–69) and PTHrP-(67–94) were used, together with 3 μg of histone H1. For cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2, reactions were carried out for 10 min. For cyclin B-p34CDC, the reaction was for 30 min. For kinetic studies cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2 reactions were for 5.5 min and cyclin B-p34CDC was for 15 min. Reactions were stopped by spotting 20 μl of the 30-μl reaction onto P-81 paper and washed three times with 75 mm orthophosphoric acid and once in 100% ethanol. Cerenkov counting was used to determine activity.Table IPTHrP-(67–94) is a substrate for cyclin E-CDK2, cyclin A-CDK2, and cyclin B-CDC2SubstrateCyclin E-p33CDK2Cyclin A-p33CDK2Cyclin B-p34CDC2cpmPTHrP-(67–94)6168.226218.006110.88PTHrP-(50–69)202.42193.47187.81Histone H137799.978673.005829.001 μg of PTHrP-(67–94) was used as in vitro substrate for recombinant cyclin E-CDK2, cyclin A-CDK2, and cyclin B-CDC2, and 1 μg of PTHrP-(50–69) was used as a negative control, while 3 μg of histone H1 was used as positive control and also to demonstrate the relative efficiency of PTHrP as a substrate for these kinases.

PTHrP-(1–34), -(50–69), -(67–84), and -(67–94) and CK2 substrate (Arg-Arg-Arg-Asp-Asp-Asp-Ser-Asp-Asp-Asp) were synthesized using the Merrifield solid-phase procedure and purified and characterized as described in Pearson et al. (22Pearson R.B. Mitchelhill K.I. Kemp B.E. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation-A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 265-291Google Scholar). Recombinant PTHrP-(1–84), PTHrP-(1–108), and PTHrP-(1–141) were expressed in E. coliand purified as described in Hammonds et al. (23Hammonds Jr., R.G. McKay P. Winslow G.A. Diefenbach-Jagger H.

Peptide and protein concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis following acid hydrolysis (5.7 m HCl, 110 °C, 24 h). Peptides and proteins were phosphorylated as described in the protein kinase assay protocol above. [γ-32P]ATP (500 cpm/pmol) for phospho-peptide mapping experiments and unlabeled ATP were used for HPLC and mass spectrometry experiments. The reactions were carried out in a total volume of 320 μl, incubated for 1 h at 30 °C, and terminated by adding 500 μl of 2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Removal of free [γ-32P]ATP from phosphorylated peptides and proteins was performed by application to a AG1-X8 column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) that was equilibrated with 5 bed volumes of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Unbound PTHrP-(67–94) was eluted using 6 ml of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, while PTHrP-(1–141) was eluted with 6 ml 30% (v/v) acetic acid in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Radioactive eluates were pooled and applied to a Sep-Pak C18 Cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) activated previously according to manufacturer's instructions. Phospho-proteins and phospho-peptides bound to the Sep-Pak cartridges were washed twice with 10 ml of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, eluted with 6 ml of 60% (v/v) acetonitrile, then vacuum-dried. PTHrP-(67–94) was phosphorylated as described above but using unlabeled ATP and chromatographed on a Vydac 208TP52, C8 reversed phase column using a SMARTTM HPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid at a gradient rate of 1% acetonitrile/min and a flow rate of 100 μl/min (monitored at 214 and 280 nm). As control, an equivalent amount of unphosphorylated PTHrP-(67–94) was also applied to the column and subject to identical elution protocols. Peaks corresponding to phosphorylated and unphosphorylated PTHrP were collected and their identity confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry on a Voyager DE (PerSpective Biosystems, Farmingham, MA) mass spectrometer using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. 5 μg of proteins or peptides phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP were digested at 37 °C for 24 h with 1 μg of trypsin (Promega) in 100 μl of trypsin digest buffer (50 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8.3, and 10% (v/v) acetonitrile). The peptide fragments were purified using HPLC through a Vydac 208TP52, C8 reversed phase column and confirmed with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as described above. Theoretical masses of each tryptic digest product were used to compare with the experimental masses. Two-dimensional phospho-peptide mapping of trypsin-digested phosphorylated PTHrP was performed as described by Beemon and Hunter (24Beemon K. Hunter T. J. Virol. 1978; 28: 551-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plates were exposed in a PhosphorImager cassette or an x-ray cassette for visualization. 32 P Labeling of Cells Transiently Transfected with GFP-PTHrP—10–20 μg of DNA (see below for plasmid constructs) was made up in 150 mm NaCl to a final volume of 50 μl and then added to COS-1 cells that were grown to 80% confluence in a 76-cm2 tissue culture plate, trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in 200 μl of fresh DMEM 10% FBS. The cells were electroporated in 0.4-cm gap size cuvettes at 975 microfarads, 200 V with the time constant between 40 and 42 ms using a GenePulser II (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules CA). The cells were then replaced into 10 ml of DMEM 10% FBS and allowed to recover for 4–6 h. The medium was changed once the cells reattached. The cells were allowed to grow for 48 h before labeling experiments were performed. Transiently transfected COS-1 cells were washed three times in phosphate-free DMEM, then placed into phosphate-free DMEM containing 10% FBS for 2 h. 1 mCi of 32P in the form of orthophosphoric acid in water (NEN Life Science Products) was added to the medium and left for 5 h. The cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested in 0.8 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF) plus protease inhibitors (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Lysates were diluted in 1 volume of the same buffer and precleared with Pansorbin (Calbiochem) for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared lysates were then centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C), and 3 μl of rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH) was added to the supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were then collected with 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed five times with lysis buffer, and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were visualized following Coomassie Blue staining. The gel was then dried, and radioactivity was detected using autoradiography. Bands that corresponded in size to those of GFP-PTHrP-(1–141) (45 kDa) were excised from the gel, destained, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by two-dimensional phospho-peptide mapping. Elutriation of CEM cells was performed in the Beckman J6 ME centrifuge with a JE-5 elutriation rotor, at 1500 rpm, 23 °C. The elutriation was carried out in RPMI medium with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm EDTA. The G1 cell population was plated in RPMI medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, and fractions were collected at required time points. Cell cycle distributions of fractions of elutriated cells were determined by staining with propidium iodide and analyses performed using the CellFIT program resident in a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to generate peptide mutants mimicking phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of PTHrP. These mutants encompassed the NLS with the NoS. The oligonucleotides obrf 15.144 (5′-GGGAGATCTGCCGCTCAAGACACCTGGGAAGAAAAAG-3′), obrf 15.145 (5′-GGGAGATCTGCCGCTCAAGGCACCTGGGAAGAAAAAG-3′), and obrf 15.146 (5′-GGGAGATCTGCCGCTCAAGGAACCTGGGAAGAAAAAG-3′) had BglII restriction endonuclease sites at the 5′ end to facilitate directional cloning. obrf 15.144 was equivalent to amino acids 82–90 and coding for unmutated Thr85, obrf 15.145 mutating Thr85to Ala85, and obrf 15.146 mutating Thr85 to Glu85, and when used in conjunction with obrf 15.141 (5′-CAGAAGCTTGCAATATGTCCTTGGAAGGTC-3′), generated a fragment representing PTHrP-(82–141); obrf 15.141 contained aHindIII restriction endonuclease site at the 5′ end. The mature GFP-PTHrP-(1–141) fusion protein control (pSMR792) was generated using obrf 15.140 (5′-GGAGATCTGCTGTGTCTGAACATCAGCTCCTC-3′) and obrf 15.141. Polymerase chain reaction products were generated using combinations of the above mentioned primer pairs with the full-length cDNA for PTHrP (pBRF61; Ref. 25Suva L.J. Winslow G.A. Wettenhall R.E.

The fidelity of all cloned DNA was confirmed by single-stranded DNA sequencing using a T7 DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Large scale plasmid DNA was purified (Qiaex Maxi Prep Kit, Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) and transfected into HaCaT cells using the calcium phosphate method as described in Sambrook et al. (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells were counter-stained with the DNA-specific dye, propidium iodide (Sigma) or with the actin specific dye, Texas Red-X phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Images were acquired by CLSM (Bio-Rad MRC1024). Fluorescence immunocytochemistry and CLSM of PTHrP expression in a asynchronous proliferating culture of HaCaT cells showed that PTHrP was localized to the nucleolus and the cytoplasm in cells that show a G1 phase phenotype (Fig. 1,A and B: i). In cells that show a G2 and M phenotype, which have a more intense nuclear stain, PTHrP was not detected in the nucleus but was expressed at higher levels in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, A and B:ii and iii). PTHrP expression was greatest in actively dividing cells (Fig. 1, A and B,iii). Because of this interesting observation, we looked at the sequence of the mature PTHrP protein compared with that of various nuclear proteins. The amino acid sequence of PTHrP (Fig.2) shared similarities with the CcN motifs of SV40 T-antigen, p53, c-MYC, and A-MYB (13Poon R.Y.C. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1243-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Jans D.A. Jans P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2961-2968PubMed Google Scholar). The CcN motif included a putative CDK site at Thr85. C-terminal to the CcN is a putative NoS with characteristic strings of basic amino acids flanking an arginine hinge, which is commonly found in viral proteins such as HIV-1 Tat (27Dang C.V. Lee W.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18019-18023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), HIV-1 Rev (28Cochrane W.A. Perkins A. Rosen C.A. J.

Cell. 1988; 55: 197-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the combination of parts of the NLS (Lys88-Lys-Lys-Lys91) and the NoS (Lys102-Lys-Lys-Arg-Arg-Thr-Arg108) could constitute a bipartite NLS (Fig. 2) where two blocks of basic residues are separated by a 10–12-amino acid spacer (30Robbins J.

Because of these similarities it was thought important to determine whether PTHrP could be phosphorylated by CDC2-CDK2. PTHrP peptides and recombinant PTHrP proteins were incubated with recombinant cyclin A-CDK2. All peptides and proteins were adjusted to a concentration of 6 μm and phosphorylated using 5 μg/ml cyclin A-CDK2. PTHrP-(1–108), PTHrP-(1–141), PTHrP-(67–94), and the hCK2 β peptide were phosphorylated by cyclin A-CDK2, while the PTHrP peptides PTHrP-(1–34), PTHrP-(1–84), PTHrP-(50–69), and PTHrP-(67–84) were not phosphorylated (Fig. 3). Cyclin A-CDK2 phosphorylated only PTHrP proteins and peptides containing the putative phosphorylation motif Lys84-Thr-Pro-Gly-Lys88. These results indicate that the phosphorylation site of PTHrP lies within amino acids 85 and 94, thereby implicating Thr85, the only phosphorylated amino acid present.Figure 3Cyclin A-CDK2 phosphorylates PTHrP between residues 84 and 94. 6 μm recombinant PTHrP-(1–84), -(1–108), and -(1–141), or synthetic peptide representing PTHrP-(1–34), -(50–69), -(67–84), and -(67–94), were phosphorylated with 5 μg/ml recombinant cyclin A-CDK2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Activity on the y axis is in nmol/min/mg of enzyme. CK2 substrate was used as a positive control. Results shown are mean ± S.E., n = 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To ascertain the stoichiometry of phosphorylation, PTHrP-(67–94) phosphorylated with recombinant cyclin A-CDK2 was chromatographed on a Vydac C-8 reversed phase column and the eluted peaks analyzed by mass spectrometry. The masses of the HPLC peaks were in agreement with the theoretical masses of phosphorylated PTHrP-(67–94), which is 3341.80 mass units, and unphosphorylated PTHrP-(67–94), which is 3261.80 mass units. Thr85 was confirmed to be the CDC2-CDK2 phosphorylation site of PTHrP by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic fragments of cyclin A-CDK2-phosphorylated PTHrP-(67–94). Two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping showed that both PTHrP-(67–94) and PTHrP-(1–141) shared the same CDC2-CDK2 phosphorylation site. In order to determine whether specific cyclin-CDK combinations phosphorylated PTHrP, a panel of expressed and activated cyclin-CDKs were used to phosphorylate PTHrP-(67–94) in vitro (TableI).

The proteins share a homologous core domain but have divergent amino-terminal sequences that are the site of palmitoylation for RGS-GAIP and RGS4. We investigated the function of palmitoylation for RGS16, which shares conserved amino-terminal cysteines with RGS4 and RGS5. Mutation of cysteine residues at residues 2 and 12 blocked the incorporation of [3H]palmitate into RGS16 in metabolic labeling studies of transfected cells or into purified RGS proteins in a cell-free palmitoylation assay. The purified RGS16 proteins with the cysteine mutations were still able to act as GTPase-activating protein for Giα. Inhibition or a decrease in palmitoylation did not significantly change the amount of protein that was membrane-associated. However, palmitoylation-defective RGS16 mutants demonstrated impaired ability to inhibit both Gi- and Gq-linked signaling pathways when expressed in HEK293T cells. These findings suggest that the amino-terminal region of RGS16 may affect the affinity of these proteins for Gα subunits in vivo or that palmitoylation localizes the RGS protein in close proximity to Gα subunits on cellular membranes.

Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). More than 20 mammalian RGS proteins have been identified by virtue of a common stretch of 125 amino acids termed the RGS box (2Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R.

Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), which is a site of interaction of RGS proteins and Giα subunits. RGS proteins bind and stabilize Giα in its transition state (between GTP- and GDP-bound), thus lowering the energy barrier for GTP hydrolysis (4Srinivasa S.P. Watson N. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. J.

Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Recently a group of proteins with a divergent RGS domain that act exclusively on G12α and G13α to accelerate their GTPase activity has been identified (7Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Studies of reconstituted signaling pathways in cell lines, consisting of overexpressed or endogenous receptors, RGS proteins, effectors (in some cases), and endogenous G proteins, have shown that transiently expressed RGS proteins inhibit G protein-mediated signaling in these systems (3Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 8Huang C. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11924-11927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).A perplexing question is the regulation of these 20 RGS proteins because almost all of them have powerful enzymatic activity toward the same substrates, and many may be expressed in the same cell type. Temporal or stimulus-specific transcriptional regulation, protein turnover, or post-translational modifications represent possible means of controlling the availability of a particular RGS protein to preside over a G protein-coupled signaling event at the plasma membrane. One such modification, addressed in this report, is palmitoylation.Palmitoylation, the reversible thioacylation of cysteine residues, occurs on several molecules involved in G protein-linked signaling pathways. G protein-coupled receptors incorporate [3H]palmitate upon addition of ligand (10Moffett S. Adam L. Bonin H. Loisel T.P. Bouvier M. Moulliac B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21490-21497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 11Moffett S. Moulliac B. Bonin H. Bouvier M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Gα proteins of all four classes undergo palmitoylation at their amino termini (12Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 13Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Receptor activation leads to palmitate turnover on Gsα and regulates its signaling (14Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23769-23772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mumby S.M. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Palmitoylation may also be involved in targeting Gα subunits to the plasma membrane (17Morales J. Fishburn C.S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).At least two RGS proteins, RGS4 and RGS-GAIP, undergo palmitoylationin vivo. RGS-GAIP, which contains an amino-terminal cluster of cysteines, was labeled with [3H]palmitic acid in the membrane fraction of transfected COS-7 cells, but no functional significance of this finding was determined (18De Vries L. Elenko E. Hubler L. Jones T.L.Z. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15203-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). RGS-GAIP was subsequently localized to the membranes of clathrin-coated vesicles and not the plasma membrane (19De Vries L. Elenko E. McCaffery J.M. Fischer T. Hubler L. McQuistan T. Watson N. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). RGS4, which shares conserved amino-terminal cysteines with RGS5 and RGS16 (Cys-2 and Cys-12), was palmitoylated on these residues in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells (20Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, palmitoylation was not necessary for membrane attachment in yeast, and an RGS4 double cysteine mutant (Cys-2/Cys-12) was relatively functional in yeast cells as measured by its ability to inhibit pheromone-induced signaling (20Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).RGS4 and RGS16 are highly related RGS proteins (55% identical in their RGS domains and 42% identical in their amino-terminal 30 amino acids) with similar GAP activity (21Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 22Natochin M. Lipkin V.M. Artemyev N.O. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). RGS16 was originally termed RGSr because of its abundance in the murine retina (23Chen C.-K. Wieland T. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12885-12889Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, the human orthologue was renamed RGS16 as it is found in many tissues (24Snow B.E. Antonio L. Suggs S. Siderovski D.P. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 206: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that RGS16 underwent palmitoylation in vitro and in mammalian cells. Mutation of putatively palmitoylated cysteine residues in RGS16 did not substantially alter their affinity for G proteins in vitro as measured by GAP activity or their membrane attachment, but mutants showed quantitative defects in their ability to inhibit Gi- and Gq-coupled signaling pathways in vivo. These results suggest that palmitoylation may be an important means of regulation of RGS activity in mammalian cells.DISCUSSIONRGS proteins regulate G protein signaling by increasing the GTPase activity of heterotrimeric G protein α subunits, thus augmenting deactivation. Amino-terminal cysteines of RGS16 were critical for its palmitoylation and regulation of signaling in mammalian cells. Mutations that prevented palmitoylation did not significantly alter GAP activity in vitro or subcellular localization but did substantially decrease the RGS activity on Gq- and Gi-linked pathways in vivo.Palmitoylation has previously been found on RGS-GAIP and RGS4 (18De Vries L. Elenko E. Hubler L. Jones T.L.Z. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15203-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 20Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These two proteins may represent prototypes of distinct forms of RGS palmitoylation. RGS-GAIP and two other RGS proteins, Ret-RGS1 and RGSZ1, contain a cluster of cysteines analogous to cysteine string proteins (35Faurobert E. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2945-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 36Glick J.L. Meigs T.E. Miron A. Casey P.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation occurs on the cysteine clusters of cysteine string proteins, and this modification may be involved in attaching these proteins to synaptic vesicle membranes (38Gunderson C.B. Mastrogiacomo A. Faull K. Umbach J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19197-19199PubMed Google Scholar, 39Mastrogiacomo A. Parsons S.M. Zampighi G.A. Jenden D.J. Umbach J.A. Gunderson C.B. Science. 1994; 263: 981-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). RGS-GAIP incorporates [3H]palmitate and displays properties of tight membrane association consistent with palmitoylation (18De Vries L. Elenko E. Hubler L. Jones T.L.Z. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15203-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although RGS-GAIP has been localized on clathrin-coated vesicles, the role of palmitoylation in the targeting or function of this protein is not known (19De Vries L. Elenko E. McCaffery J.M. Fischer T. Hubler L. McQuistan T. Watson N. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).In contrast to RGS proteins with a cysteine string, RGS16, RGS4, and RGS5 have only 2–3 cysteine residues outside the RGS box, at their amino terminus (20Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The amino termini of these proteins are conserved with cysteines at residues 2 and 12 for all three (Table I). Structural modeling of a consensus sequence of the amino terminus predicts that it forms an amphipathic α helix with Cys-2 and Cys-12 on the hydrophobic face. Palmitoylation may aid the membrane attachment of the protein, but other regions of the protein must be involved because the absence of palmitoylation on RGS16 does not preclude its retention at the membrane. Palmitoylation may orient an α helix or possibly another conformation toward the membrane and facilitate interactions between this region of the RGS protein and another membrane-bound protein that recognizes the conserved residues. Without palmitate, the protein interactions may be adequate for attachment but inadequate for functional interactions. The possibility of another protein that targets RGS proteins to the membrane is suggested by a recent study (40Druey K.M. Sullivan B.M. Brown D. Fischer E.R. Watson N. Blumer K.J. Gerfen C.R. Scheschonka A. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18405-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We found that expression of a constitutively active mutant, Giα2(Q205L), results in translocation of cytosolic RGS4 to the plasma membrane (40Druey K.M. Sullivan B.M. Brown D. Fischer E.R. Watson N. Blumer K.J. Gerfen C.R. Scheschonka A. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18405-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, RGS proteins do not directly interact with a similar Giα1mutant (Q204L) (31Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). We also found that an RGS4 mutant (L159F), which does not bind Giα in any nucleotide-binding state, translocated as well as the wild-type RGS4 protein. Thus, the mechanism whereby a protein-protein interaction may target an RGS to the membrane is unclear at present.The conserved RGS box alone is sufficient for GAP activity in vitro (4Srinivasa S.P. Watson N. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1529-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 41Popov S. Yu K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34687-34689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Although the RGS box is the primary site of RGS4 interaction with Giα1 based on the crystal structure, this structure included neither the 50 amino-terminal residues of RGS4 nor the 5 amino-terminal residues of Giα1, so it is not known if there are other sites of interaction (6Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation of Gα subunits, which occurs on cysteine 3 for Giα family members, inhibited the GAP activity of RGS proteins (44Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), indicating the importance of regions not seen in the crystal structure for the interaction between these proteins. Similarly, De Vries et al. (45De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) found that deletion of the 10 most carboxyl-terminal residues of Giα3 markedly diminished its interaction with RGS-GAIP in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Recently published studies (43Zeng W. Xu X. Popov S. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Swistok J. Danho W. Yagaloff K.A. Fisher S.L. Ross E.M. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol.

A peptide consisting of the first 33 residues of RGS4 blocked carbachol-dependent but not cholecystokinin-dependent signaling, both of which are mediated by Gq proteins (43Zeng W. Xu X. Popov S. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Swistok J. Danho W. Yagaloff K.A. Fisher S.L. Ross E.M. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol.

Interestingly, a peptide with the cysteines at positions 2, 12, and 33 replaced by alanines was 100-fold less effective (43Zeng W. Xu X. Popov S. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Swistok J. Danho W.

Palmitoylation and tethering of the RGS protein to the membrane could establish a protein conformation critical for interactions with both G proteins and receptors.Our results with the constitutively active Gqα(Q209L) mutant suggest that palmitoylation may alter another function of RGS proteins. Inhibition of CREB activation induced by Gqα(Q209L) is probably through effector antagonism because RGS proteins do not interact with or stimulate the GTPase activity of a similar Giα mutant (Giα1Q204L) (31Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Both RGS4 and RGS-GAIP have been shown to block the interaction between Gqα-GTP and its effector, phospholipase Cβ (47Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In addition, a peptide with the amino-terminal sequence of RGS4 could block the interactions of Gqα and phospholipase Cβ (45De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The reason for the partial function of the double mutant in our assays is unclear; perhaps the Cys-2 mutation actually enhances interaction with the Gqα protein in this GTP-bound conformation and serves to counteract the effect of the Cys-12 mutation. In fact, we cannot exclude structural differences of these mutants in vivo(independent of lipid modification) even though the cysteine mutations did not affect the catalytic power of RGS16 in vitro. For Gqα, amino-terminal cysteine residues are important for coupling to the effector, phospholipase Cβ, independent of their palmitoylation (48Hepler J.R. Biddlecome G.H. Kleuss C. Camp L.A. Hofmann S.L. Ross E.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 496-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For RGS proteins, these cysteine residues may directly interact with Gα proteins because neither the stoichiometry of palmitoylated to unpalmitoylated protein nor the kinetics of palmitate turnover on RGS proteins during the GTPase cycle is known.Palmitoylation of RGS may also regulate Gα interactions independently of its effect on the protein-protein interface simply by targeting RGS proteins to membrane microdomains that also hold Gαsubunits and possibly other signaling components. Receptors, Gα subunits, and RGS proteins all undergo palmitoylation. One type of microdomain has been characterized by its detergent insolubility, low density on centrifugation, and enrichment of cholesterol and sphingolipids (49Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8017) Google Scholar). These cholesterol/sphingolipid rafts have a high affinity for saturated, long chain fatty acids such as palmitate (50Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), and many proteins found in rafts are palmitoylated (51Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Cysteine residues that undergo palmitoylation on endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, p56lck, and GAP-43 are critical for targeting those proteins to these membrane domains (52Shaul P.W. Smart E.J.

Concentration of these low abundance proteins to small areas within the membrane may be necessary for their action within cells. These domains may differ between mammalian cells and yeast cells to explain the results of Srinivasa and colleagues (20Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), who found relatively preserved activity and plasma membrane localization of palmitoylation-defective RGS4 in yeast.The regulation of RGS proteins in cells is poorly understood. Their powerful catalytic activities suggest that they must be carefully regulated. Transcriptional control is likely to represent one means of modulating RGS expression (3Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), but the reversible nature of palmitoylation would also allow it to control the function of the protein. Palmitate on Gα turns over upon activation (14Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23769-23772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mumby S.M. Kleuss C.

Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Likewise, palmitoylation, with its inherent reversibility, may prove to harness the action of RGS proteins on Gα subunits.

More than 20 mammalian RGS proteins have been identified by virtue of a common stretch of 125 amino acids termed the RGS box (2Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R.

Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), which is a site of interaction of RGS proteins and Giα subunits. RGS proteins bind and stabilize Giα in its transition state (between GTP- and GDP-bound), thus lowering the energy barrier for GTP hydrolysis (4Srinivasa S.P. Watson N. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. J.

Recently a group of proteins with a divergent RGS domain that act exclusively on G12α and G13α to accelerate their GTPase activity has been identified (7Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Studies of reconstituted signaling pathways in cell lines, consisting of overexpressed or endogenous receptors, RGS proteins, effectors (in some cases), and endogenous G proteins, have shown that transiently expressed RGS proteins inhibit G protein-mediated signaling in these systems (3Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 8Huang C. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11924-11927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A perplexing question is the regulation of these 20 RGS proteins because almost all of them have powerful enzymatic activity toward the same substrates, and many may be expressed in the same cell type. Temporal or stimulus-specific transcriptional regulation, protein turnover, or post-translational modifications represent possible means of controlling the availability of a particular RGS protein to preside over a G protein-coupled signaling event at the plasma membrane. One such modification, addressed in this report, is palmitoylation. Palmitoylation, the reversible thioacylation of cysteine residues, occurs on several molecules involved in G protein-linked signaling pathways. G protein-coupled receptors incorporate [3H]palmitate upon addition of ligand (10Moffett S. Adam L. Bonin H. Loisel T.P. Bouvier M. Moulliac B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Receptor activation leads to palmitate turnover on Gsα and regulates its signaling (14Degtyarev M.Y.

We show here that conditioned medium (CM) of MP24.15 antisense-transfected SKNMC neuroblastoma has significantly higher levels of Aβ. Furthermore, synthetic-Aβ degradation was increased or decreased following incubation with CM of sense or antisense-transfected cells, respectively. Soluble Aβ1–42 was degraded more slowly than soluble Aβ1–40, while aggregated Aβ1–42 showed almost no degradation. Pretreatment of CM with serine proteinase inhibitors 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride and diisopropyl fluorophosphate completely inhibited Aβ degradation. Additionally, α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), a serpin family inhibitor tightly associated with plaques and elevated in AD brain, blocked up to 60% of Aβ degradation. Interestingly, incubation of CM of MP24.15-overexpressing cells with ACT formed an SDS-resistant ACT complex, suggesting an ACT-serine proteinase interaction. Recombinant MP24.15 alone did not degrade Aβ. 14C-Diisopropyl fluorophosphate-radiolabeled CM from MP24.15-overexpressing cells contained increased levels of several active serine proteinases, suggesting that MP24.15 activates one or more Aβ-degrading serine proteases. Thus, ACT may cause Aβ accumulation by inhibiting an Aβ-degrading enzyme or by direct binding to Aβ, rendering it degradation-resistant. Identification of the Aβ-degrading enzyme and MP24.15's role in its activation is underway. Pharmacological modulation of either enzyme may provide a means of regulating Aβ in the brain.

Kawas C. Terry R.D. Katzman R. Bick K.L. Alzheimer Disease. Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar). Evidence indicates that accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits in senile plaques and in cerebrovasculature is associated with the pathophysiology of AD (2Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). The Aβ peptide is composed of 40–42 amino acids (3Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3621) Google Scholar). The events leading to its formation from the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP) involve proteolytic cleavage by enzymes that have been termed: 1) β-secretase, which cleaves at the amino terminus of Aβ, and 2) γ-secretase, which cleaves at the carboxyl terminus. In the senile plaques Aβ is associated with a number of proteins, including α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) (4Abraham C.R. Selkoe D.J. Potter H. Cell. 1988; 52: 487-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar), which is a serine proteinase inhibitor of the serpin family as well as an acute-phase protein (5Koj A. Gordon A. Koj A. Acute Phase Response to Injury and Infection. Elsevier, Amsterdam1985Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized 10 years ago that ACT may play a role in APP processing (4Abraham C.R. Selkoe D.J.

The majority of secreted Aβ is 40 amino acids in length (Aβ1–40), but approximately 10% of all Aβ is 42 amino acids in length (Aβ1–42) (11Ho L. Fukuchi K. Younkin S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30929-30934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Little is known about how secreted Aβ is degraded and cleared from the extracellular milieu. The excessive cerebral accumulation of Aβ that occurs in AD could be explained in part by a decreased ability of the brain to degrade and clear Aβ. If neural cells can be shown to release specific Aβ-degrading proteinases, changes in the activity of such proteinases and/or their up-regulation could represent a therapeutic approach to AD. We have explored the role of the metalloendopeptidase MP24.15 in the degradation of Aβ. MP24.15 is a thiol-dependent enzyme that was purified to homogeneity from AD brain as a candidate β-secretase (12Papastoitsis G. Siman R. Scott R. Abraham C.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). McDermot et al. (13McDermott J.R. Biggins J.A. Gibson A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) also identified a partially purified MP24.15 as a potential β-secretase using synthetic peptide substrates. In vitro, MP24.15 has been shown to be involved in the inactivation of a number of neuropeptides, including somatostatin, bradykinin, substance P, and neurotensin (14Dando P.M.

(June 13, 1995) U. S. Patent 5424205.Google Scholar, 18Thompson A. Huber G. Malherbe P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In an attempt to further examine the β-secretase properties of MP24.15 under physiologic conditions, we transfected human neuroblastoma cells with MP24.15 cDNA in the sense and antisense directions to test its activity on the endogenous, membrane-bound APP. Aβ amounts produced by cells containing the mock-, sense-, or antisense-transfected cDNA were compared. Contrary to our expectations, we observed higher Aβ levels in the conditioned medium (CM) of antisense-transfected cells than in the CM of sense- or mock-transfected cells, while APP levels remained unchanged. These unexpected results prompted us to further investigate MP24.15. Here we report that MP24.15 is involved in the degradation of Aβ rather than its production. Previous reports have shown that rat microglia, astrocytes, and human THP-1 monocyte cells are important in the formation (19Wisniewski H.M. Wegiel J. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1994; 20: 192-194PubMed Google Scholar) or clearance of Aβ and amyloid fibers (20Christie R.H. Freeman M. Hyman B.T. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 399-403PubMed Google Scholar) when Aβ is added to the culture medium, but that rat neurons do not possess this degradative potential (21Shaffer L.M. Dority M.D. Gupta-Bansal R.

Proteinase inhibition studies have also been utilized to determine which class of proteinase is responsible for the degradation of Aβ in the culture media of microglial cells. Mentlein et al. (22Mentlein R. Ludwig R. Martensen I. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) determined that lipopolysaccharide-activated microglial cells release a 200-kDa metalloproteinase that preferentially degrades soluble, but not polymerized, Aβ. Naidu et al. (23Naidu A. Quon D. Cordell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1369-1374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) found that the levels of soluble Aβ peptide released to the media of Chinese hamster ovary cells are reduced over time due to the activity of multiple types of proteinases, including those from the metallo, aspartyl, and thiol classes. Banks et al. (24Banks W.A. Maness L.M. Banks M.F. Kastin A.J. Neurotoxicol. Teratol. 1996; 18: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) identified an erythrocyte-derived metalloproteinase that shows a loss of Aβ degradation activity in the presence of aluminum. Other proteinases including the lysosomal enzyme, cathepsin D (25Hamazaki H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and extracellular proteinases, including matrix metalloproteinase 2/gelatinase-A (26Roher A.E. Kasunic T.C. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Ball M.J. Fridman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1755-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have been reported to be involved in the processing of Aβ. Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), a 110-kDa metalloproteinase, has additionally recently been shown to bind to and degrade radioiodinated Aβ peptide (27Kurochkin I.V. Goto S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 28McDermott J.R. Gibson A.M. Neurochem. Res. 1997; 22: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 29Qiu W.Q. Walsh D.M.

This degradation by IDE occurs in rat brain and liver, human brain synaptic membrane fractions, and microglial cells in culture. Additionally, there have been several reports of serine proteinases that degrade the Aβ peptide. One such 68-kDa proteinase isolated from human brain partially degrades Aβ purified from human brain (30Matsumoto A. Enomoto T. Fujiwara Y. Baba H. Matsumoto R. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 220: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Another 28-kDa serine proteinase was found in conditioned medium of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with APP695. Although this serine proteinase originated from the trypsin cell passing solution, it was shown to complex with α2-macroglobulin (α2M) serum component and to degrade both Aβ1–40 and 1–42 (31Qiu W.Q.

In parallel to the direct proteolysis of Aβ, alternative methods of Aβ trafficking and processing have been studied. The serpin- enzyme complex receptor was identified in cells for its ability to bind to ACT and other serine proteinase inhibitors, and investigations have also shown that serpin-enzyme complex receptor mediates Aβ internalization and degradation (32Boland K. Behrens M. Choi D. Manias K. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18032-18044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The proteinase inhibitor α2M was shown to bind Aβ directly, possibly mediating Aβ uptake by the α2M uptake receptor, or low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (33Narita M. Holtzman D.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1904-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 34Du Y. Ni B. Glinn M. Dodel R.C. Bales K.R. Zhang Z. Hyslop P.A. Paul S.M. J.

The receptor for advanced glycation end products has also been shown to interact with Aβ and it may contribute to neurotoxicity that results in dementia (35Yan S.D. Chen X. Fu J. Chen M. Zhu H. Roher A. Slattery T. Zhao L. Nagashima M. Morser J. Migheli A. Nawroth P. Stern D. Smidt A.M. Nature. 1996; 382: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar). It is likely that different cells utilize different mechanisms for the clearance of Aβ whereas microglial cells may use IDE as their major Aβ-degrading enzyme while neuronal cells may use a serine proteinase. Identification of the proteinases involved in Aβ catabolism therefore is critically important for the development of therapeutics to prevent or treat AD. Our approach has been to follow up on the metalloproteinase MP24.15. Its role in the proteolytic cascade leading to Aβ degradation holds great promise for direct intervention in the pathophysiology of AD. SKNMC human neuroblastoma cell line (ATCC, MD) were cultured in minimal Eagle's medium-α supplemented with various batches of 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were regularly monitored for growth and viability by trypan blue exclusion assay. The MP24.15 cDNA was obtained from Dr. G. Huber (Hoffman la Roche, Basel, Switzerland (18Thompson A. Huber G. Malherbe P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A construct containing the full-length MP24.15 cDNA (2551 base pairs) in the pCDNA3.1/Zeo plasmid (Invitrogen, CA) was used for transfection of the SKNMC cells. The cells were plated at 106 cells/100-mm dish and allowed to attach for 18–24 h. The medium was then changed, and the cells were transfected 2 to 4 h later with 20 μg of plasmid DNA by the calcium-phosphate method using a Calcium Phosphate Mammalian Cell Transfection Kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). The initial incubation of the plates (4 h, 37 °C, 5% CO2) was followed by a 15% glycerol shock (3 min at room temperature). After washing with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, the cells were allowed to recover overnight in minimal Eagle's medium-α containing 10% FBS. The following day the cells were split into 5 plates and were incubated with minimal Eagle's medium-α containing 10% FBS and 400 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) for selection. Medium was changed every 3–4 days and stably transfected clones were collected. MP24.15 antisense constructs were cloned into the pCDNA3.1/Zeo plasmid as well. These constructs contain theKpnI/SmaI fragment of the MP24.15 cDNA (1191 base pairs) and were subcloned into the plasmid in the antisense direction. The SKNMC cells were transfected with the antisense construct as above. All transfected cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and Zeocin. After several passages, the MP24.15 antisense transfected cells were cloned by limiting dilution under Zeocin selective conditions, and 12 clones were collected. Mock-transfected cells were transfected with a pCDNA3.1/Zeo plasmid that lacked a DNA insert. MP24.15 overexpressing cells, MP24.15 antisense-transfected cells, or mock-transfected cells were grown to confluence in minimal Eagle's medium-α containing 10% FBS in 100-mm dishes. Once confluent, the plates were washed twice with serum-free and phenol-red free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated for 18–24 h with the same medium at 37 °C (in some experiments, N2 supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to the serum-free medium). The following day, the CM was collected and centrifuged at 1500 rpm to pellet the cell debris. The plates were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were harvested using cell scrapers (Nalge Nunc Intl., Naperville, IL) in the presence of 300 μl of homogenizing/lysis buffer containing 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm AEBSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Cell lysates were sonicated until all visible particular matter disappeared. Protein levels in each of the CM and cell lysate samples were measured using the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). 15–20 μg of protein from each sample was electrophoresed on a 10% Tris glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) or on 10–20% Tris-Tricine gels (Novex, San-Diego, CA). Gels were then soaked for 20 min in blotting buffer and blotted onto Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for 2 h at 200 mA for the glycine gels or 2 h at 100 V for the Tris-Tricine gradient gels. After transfer the blots were incubated with 5% milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20). Blots were incubated with the specific primary antibody as indicated in each figure. After 3 washes with TBST (15 min each), secondary antibody (Sigma) conjugated to alkaline-phosphatase was applied, and the blots were washed again three times as above. Reactions were developed in the presence of alkaline-phosphatase premixed substrate reagents kit (Bio-Rad). For the detection of MP24.15, we used monoclonal antibody IVD6 generated in our laboratory (36Conn K.J. Pietropaolo M. Ju S.T. Abraham C.R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2011-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For the IDE detection, we used the monoclonal antibody that was kindly provided by Dr. Richard A. Roth, Stanford University. For detection of ACT, we used sheep anti-human ACT antibodies (Atlantic Antibodies, Stillwater, MN). Conditioned medium supernatants (1–3 ml) were precleared by incubation with 50 μl of goat anti-mouse conjugated affinity gel-Sepharose (Cappel, Organon Teknika Corp. West Chester, PA) for 1 h at 4 °C on a rocker platform. Samples were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 min, at 4 °C, and the precleared supernatants were incubated with the 6E10 (1:300) monoclonal antibody against Aβ1–16 (37Kim S.K. Wen G.Y. Bancher C. Chen C.M.J. Sapienza V.J. Hong H. Wisniewski H.M. Neurosci. Res. Commun. 1990; 7: 113-121Google Scholar) for 5 or 18 h on a rocker at 4 °C. The goat anti-mouse antibody affinity gel (50 μl) was added, and incubation on the rocker continued for an additional 4 h. The immunoprecipitated complex was collected by centrifugation (same as above) and washed three times 20 min each with STEN buffer containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 0.4% Nonidet P-40 as follows: the first wash contained STEN buffer + 0.5 m NaCl; the second wash STEN buffer + 0.1% SDS; and the third wash, STEN buffer alone. All buffers also contained 20 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The pellet obtained following the last wash and centrifugation was resuspended in 12 μl of 2 × loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and loaded on a 10–20% gradient Tris-Tricine gel. Gels were then blotted and probed with the 6E10 antibody or other antibodies as indicated in the figures. Human α2M (Athens Research and Technology, Athens, GA) was incubated at room temperature with 0.23m methylamine for 110 min to yield methylamine-activated α2M. Incubation was performed in a buffer consisting of 0.2 m HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA. Excess methylamine was removed by desalting on Sephadex G-25M cartridge column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Synthetic Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 (Bachem, Torrance, CA) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 2 mg/ml (0.5 mm). For radioiodination, 8 μg of Aβ were mixed with 90 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 μl of Na125I (0.2 mCi), and one Iodo-Bead (Pierce). The mixture was incubated for 20 min and the iodinated peptide separated from the unbound free iodine on a Sepharose G-25 spin column (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.). CM (10 μl) of MP24.15 sense-, antisense-, or mock-transfected cells were incubated with 10 μl (5 μm) iodinated Aβ1–40 or 1–42 (50 cpm/μl) at 37 °C for different lengths of time (as specified for each experiment). Following incubation, Laemmli sample buffer was added to the samples, which were then boiled and electrophoresed on a 10–20% Tris-Tricine gel. The gels were then fixed in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid solution, dried, and exposed to x-ray film for 1–3 h as needed. When proteinase inhibitors were used in the degradation assay, the CM were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with the different inhibitors prior to the addition of the iodinated Aβ peptide. The following inhibitors were used: 0.15 mm Cpp-Ala-Ala-Phe-pAB-HCl (a specific inhibitor for MP24.15), 2 mm AEBSF (a serine proteinase inhibitor), 2 mm Zincov (a zinc metalloproteinase inhibitor), 10 mm 1,10-phenanthroline (a metalloproteinase inhibitor), 1.5 μm purified ACT (a serine proteinase inhibitor) (Athens Research and Technology, Athens, GA). In some experiments radiolabeled Aβ was left to aggregate at room temperature for 1 week prior to the addition of CM. Afterward, 10 μl of CM was added, the samples were incubated in a 37 °C in a water bath for 5–18 h. Sample buffer was added, and the samples were separated on 10–20% Tris-Tricine gels as above. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Autoradiographs were analyzed by computer-assisted densitometry from which percent inhibition was calculated for each inhibitor. For each CM, the percent of the undegraded Aβ was calculated with and without inhibitor. CM (9 μl) from the various transfected cells was incubated with 1.5 μl of 1 mTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, for 5 min in a 37 °C water bath. Then, 1 μl of 14C-diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP, NEN Life Science Products Inc.) was added, and the samples incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Laemmli sample buffer was then added and the samples were boiled and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed for 40 min in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, treated for 30 min at room temperature with Enlightning™ solution (NEN Life Science Products Inc.), and dried. The dried gels were then exposed to x-ray film (Kodak) to view the DFP-labeled bands. ACT (0.75 μm) was incubated with 20 μl of CM of mock- or MP24.15-transfected cells, or with 0.75 μm cathepsin G (molar ratio 1:1) for 1 h in a 37 °C water bath. In another experiment 0.75 μm ACT and 0.75 μmcathepsin G were added to CM of mock- and sense-transfected cells. Laemmli sample buffer with mercaptoethanol was added to the samples, which were then boiled and separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were electroblotted and the bands on the Western blots were detected with anti-ACT antibodies. In several experiments we used human recombinant MP24.15 protein (a generous gift from Dr. Marc Glucksman, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, NY). Activity of the recombinant MP24.15 protein was monitored using the fluorescent substrate Mcc-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-d-Lys(Dnp)-OH (Novabiochem, San Diego, CA). In order to establish the role MP24.15 plays in APP processing, we stably transfected the human neuroblastoma cell line SKNMC with the full-length cDNA of MP24.15, and with a fragment that contains most of the cDNA in the antisense orientation. Western blot analysis using our monoclonal antibody IVD6 against MP24.15 demonstrates that overexpression of MP24.15 in these cells results in higher levels of this enzyme in cell extracts (Fig.1 A), as well as in CM (Fig. 4) than the endogenous levels of mock-transfected cells. Fig.1 B shows the expression of MP24.15 in 5 different clones of SKNMC cells transfected with antisense constructs. Among these antisense clones, some exhibit undetectable or significantly lower levels of MP24.15 expression (lanes 2 and 4–6) as compared with mock-transfected clones (lane 1), while others (lane 3) display endogenous levels of MP24.15 expression. APP and APP fragments, including the naturally secreted Aβ, were monitored by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of cell lysates and CM of transfected cells with monoclonal antibody 6E10. Interestingly, when we measured the amounts of APP and Aβ in the lysates and CM of the various cells, we observed that soluble Aβ levels in the CM of the MP24.15 antisense-transfected cells were high, while Aβ was not detectable in CM of mock-transfected cells. The amounts of APP in lysates and CM of all cells were comparable (Fig.2). These results suggest that the reduced level of MP24.15 caused an increase in Aβ, indicating that MP24.15 may be involved in Aβ degradation.Figure 4Comparison of MP24.15 and IDE levels in cell lysates and conditioned media of transfected SKNMC cells. Western blot shows MP24.15 and IDE levels in cell lysates (lanes 1–3) and in serum-free CM (lanes 4–6) of transfected SKNMC cells: MP24.15 sense (1 and 4), MP24.15 antisense (2 and 5), and mock (3 and6). The band of approximately 70 kDa seen on both blots is due to nonspecific staining of albumin left from the serum. Note that IDE levels in all lysate and in all CM lanes are comparable while the levels of MP24.15 are higher in the lysate and CM of sense-transfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 2The effect of knock-down of MP24.15 on APP processing. CM and cell lysates of MP24.15 antisense- or mock-transfected SKNMC cells were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody 6E10. Samples were then separated on a gel and Western blots were reacted with the same 6E10 antibody. 1, M r markers; 2, cell lysates of antisense-transfected cells; 3, cell lysates of mock- transfected cells; 4, CM of antisense-transfected cells;5, CM of mock-transfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the role MP24.15 plays in Aβ degradation, CM of MP24.15 sense-, antisense-, and mock-transfected cells were incubated with synthetic 125I-Aβ1–40 and 125I-Aβ1–42 for 4, 8, 16, and 32 h at 37 °C, and Aβ degradation was monitored as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We found that (a) CM of MP24.15 sense-transfected cells exhibit the highest Aβ-degrading activity; (b) CM of mock-transfected cells, which express the endogenous MP24.15, exhibit an intermediate Aβ degrading activity; (c) CM of antisense-transfected cells, which contain the lowest MP24.15 levels, exhibit the lowest Aβ degrading activity (Fig. 3 A). Aβ incubated with Tris buffer or with medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, as a control, is not detectably degraded during the 32-h incubation period (Fig. 3 A). The difference in Aβ degradation rates of CM of MP24.15-overexpressing cells and CM of mock-transfected cells is more clearly demonstrated in the shorter time course experiment described in Fig. 3 B. Serum-free CM did not exhibit any Aβ-degrading ability (data not shown), but in the presence of serum the amount of Aβ degradation directly correlates with MP24.15 levels. The effect of the serum was independent of the lot used. Comparison of the degradation rates of Aβ1–40 and 1–42 clearly demonstrates that Aβ1–42 catabolism is slower than that of Aβ1–40 under the same conditions (Fig.3 A). Additionally, Aβ1–42 partially aggregates during the incubation time in 10 mm Tris buffer and appears as a high molecular weight band in the lanes that contain Aβ1–42 alone in Tris buffer, but not in those lanes containing medium with 10% serum as control (data not shown). Interestingly, in all lanes where Aβ degradation occurs an approximately 30-kDa band is seen, suggesting that iodinated Aβ binds to a CM protein that may represent an Aβ-degrading serine proteinase.

https://openalex.org/W2077417063,"Recent studies have identified a β-cell insulin receptor that functions in the regulation of protein translation and mitogenic signaling similar to that described for insulin-sensitive cells. These findings have raised the novel possibility that β-cells may exhibit insulin resistance similar to skeletal muscle, liver, and fat. To test this hypothesis, the effects of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), a cytokine proposed to mediate insulin resistance by interfering with insulin signaling at the level of the insulin receptor and its substrates, was evaluated. TNFα inhibited p70s6k activation by glucose-stimulated β-cells of the islets of Langerhans in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with maximal inhibition observed at ∼20–50 ng/ml, detected after 24 and 48 h of exposure. Exogenous insulin failed to prevent TNFα-induced inhibition of p70s6k, suggesting a defect in the insulin signaling pathway. To further define mechanisms responsible for this inhibition and also to exclude cytokine-induced nitric oxide (NO) as a mediator, the ability of exogenous or endogenous insulin ± inhibitors of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) activity, aminoguanidine or N-monomethyl-l-arginine, was evaluated. Unexpectedly, TNFα and also interleukin 1 (IL-1)-induced inhibition of p70s6k was completely prevented by inhibitors that block NO production. Western blot analysis verified inducible NOS (iNOS) expression after TNFα exposure. Furthermore, the ability of IL-1 receptor antagonist protein, IRAP, to block TNFα-induced inhibition of p70s6k indicated that activation of intra-islet macrophages and the release of IL-1 that induces iNOS expression in β-cells was responsible for the inhibitory effects of TNFα. This mechanism was confirmed by the ability of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonist 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 to attenuate TNFα-induced insulin resistance by down-regulating iNOS expression and/or blocking IL-1 release from activated macrophages. Overall, TNFα-mediated insulin resistance in β-cells is characterized by a global inhibition of metabolism mediated by NO differing from that proposed for this proinflammatory cytokine in insulin-sensitive cells.

Overall, TNFα-mediated insulin resistance in β-cells is characterized by a global inhibition of metabolism mediated by NO differing from that proposed for this proinflammatory cytokine in insulin-sensitive cells. A hallmark of human type 2 diabetes is an initial attenuated responsiveness of cells to insulin (a term designated as insulin resistance) that is countered or compensated by the ability of pancreatic β-cells to secrete more insulin than normally required to achieve euglycemia (1Khan B.B. Cell. 1998; 92: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 2Khan C.R.

Sustained hyperglycemia, however, occurs when the ability of β-cells to over-secrete insulin fails, resulting in overt diabetes. This sequence of events has generated the concept that a specific defect in the insulin-signaling pathway of insulin-sensitive cells such as skeletal muscle, fat, and liver is a primary cause for insulin resistance. As a secondary effect of insulin resistance, β-cell failure or the loss of the ability of β-cells to compensate has been proposed to be mediated by glucose toxicity, cellular exhaustion, and/or other undefined cellular mechanisms (4McClain D.A.

More recent findings using gene knockout approaches have shown that disruption of insulin receptor substrate protein-2 (IRS-2) 1The abbreviations used are: IRS-2, insulin receptor substrate 2; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; IL-1β, interleukin 1β; KRBB, Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer; BSA, bovine serum albumin; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; NMMA, N-monomethyl-l-arginine; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; IRAP, IL-1 receptor antagonist protein; PHAS-I, phosphorylated heat- and acid-stable protein regulated by insulin; 4EBP-1, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1; p70s6k, p70 S6 kinase; 15d-PGJ2, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: IRS-2, insulin receptor substrate 2; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; IL-1β, interleukin 1β; KRBB, Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer; BSA, bovine serum albumin; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; NMMA, N-monomethyl-l-arginine; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; IRAP, IL-1 receptor antagonist protein; PHAS-I, phosphorylated heat- and acid-stable protein regulated by insulin; 4EBP-1, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1; p70s6k, p70 S6 kinase; 15d-PGJ2, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. in mice results in defects in both insulin action and insulin secretion by β-cells, which closely mimics the development of human type 2 diabetes (7Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.-M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Of particular significance, IRS-2 knockout mice exhibit a reduced mass of β-cells compared with wild-type mice, suggesting that this defect in the insulin signaling pathway also produces a functional defect in mitogenic signaling, resulting in decreased β-cell replication and growth. These novel results have altered this previous concept for the development of type 2 diabetes by demonstrating that disruption of a single gene product, i.e. IRS-2, involved in insulin signaling may be responsible for insulin resistance in insulin-sensitive tissues and also in pancreatic β-cells. Thus, β-cell failure may be because of insulin resistance rather than β-cell toxicity or exhaustion that occurs in parallel with the development of peripheral insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. Evidence in support of a functional β-cell insulin receptor has been reported recently by several groups. Studies by Rothenberg et al. (8Rothenberg P.L. Willison L.D. Simon J. Wolf B.A. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 802-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) characterize an insulin-activated cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase and IRS-1 that associates with the 85-kDa α subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase in the β-cell line βTC3. Overexpression of the human insulin receptor in the β-cell line βTC6-F7 also regulates insulin gene expression and insulin content (9Xu G.G. Rothenberg P.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1243-1252PubMed Google Scholar). Harbeck et al. (10Harbeck M.C. Louie D.C. Howland J. Wolf B.A. Rothenberg P.L. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 711-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also describe expression of insulin receptor mRNA and IRS-1 in single primary rat β-cells. Furthermore, Leibiger et al. (11Leibiger I.B. Leibiger B. Moede T. Berggren P.O. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 933-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) show that endogenous insulin secreted from the β-cell line HIT promotes insulin biosynthesis by enhancing insulin gene transcription in an autocrine manner. In addition, our laboratory presented findings suggesting that glucose-stimulated phosphorylation of the translational factors PHAS-I (also known as 4EBP-1) and p70s6k by β-cells of the islet is mediated via insulin interacting in an autocrine manner with its own insulin receptor (12Xu G. Marshall C.A. Lin T.-A. Kwon G. Munivenkatappa R.B. Hill J.R. Lawrence Jr., J.C. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4485-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Our more recent studies show that amino acids, in particular branched-chain amino acids, stimulate phosphorylation of PHAS-I and p70s6k and are also essential for insulin and other growth factors to activate these same translational regulators (13Xu G.

An understanding of causes responsible for the development of insulin resistance in insulin-sensitive cells has focused on the close relationship between obesity and defects in insulin signaling. A large number of studies have identified the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) as a potential mediator of insulin resistance associated with obesity. Overexpression of TNFα by fat tissue in both obese animals and humans has been correlated with the development of peripheral insulin resistance (14Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar, 15Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A key observation indicating that TNFα may exert a role in the development of insulin resistance is that neutralization of TNFα in obese rats increases insulin sensitivity (16Hotamisiligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (5970) Google Scholar). In addition, TNFα also interferes with insulin signaling in vitro by inhibiting insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (17Hotamisiligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 27: 665-668Crossref Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). In this latter case, TNFα induces serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which then is believed to function as an inhibitor of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Another important feature of insulin resistance is the ability of the PPARγ agonists troglitazone and a derivative of prostaglandin D2, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), to correct this defect (20Spiegelman B.M.

The antidiabetic agent troglitazone also ameliorates both insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in diabetic animals and type 2 diabetics (22Lee M.-K. Miles P.D.G. Khoursheed M. Gao K.-M. Moossa A.R. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 23Nolan J.J. Ludvik B. Beerdsen P. Joyce M. Olefsky J. N. Eng. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Furthermore, troglitazone normalizes TNFα-induced inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in rodents (24Miles P.D.G. Romeo O.M. Higo K. Cohen A. Rafaat K. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Troglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 also prevent TNFα-induced inhibition of the most proximal steps in insulin signalingi.e. tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and its substrate IRS-1 and activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinasein vitro (25Peraldi P. Xu M. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1863-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Of particular importance, troglitazone also improves the reduced response of β-cells to glucose observed in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (26Cavaghan M.K. Ehrmann D.A. Byrne M.M. Polonsky K.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 530-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and decreases the ratio of plasma proinsulin to immunoreactive insulin in type 2 diabetics (27Prigeon R.L. Kahn S.E. Porte Jr., D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Overall, these findings suggest that troglitazone may improve β-cell function in addition to insulin sensitivity. To further assess if defects in insulin signaling may negatively impact β-cells in a manner analogous to that described for insulin-sensitive cells, we have examined whether TNFα, an important mediator of insulin resistance in insulin-sensitive cells, also mediates insulin resistance in pancreatic β-cells. As a measure of β-cell insulin resistance, we have examined the phosphorylation level of p70s6k in response to stimulation by glucose or amino acids. This parameter has been shown to be a reliable measure of insulin action (28Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN).

Islets were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) by collagenase digestion as described previously (12Xu G. Marshall C.A. Lin T.-A. Kwon G. Munivenkatappa R.B. Hill J.R.

Briefly, pancreases were inflated with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and the tissue was isolated, minced, and digested with 7 mg of collagenase/pancreas for 7 min at 38 °C. Islets were separated on a Ficoll step density gradient and then selected with a stereomicroscope to exclude any contaminating tissues. Islets were cultured overnight in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 in “complete” CMRL-1066 tissue culture medium containing 5.5 mm glucose, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Where CMRL is stated, the culture medium does not contain fetal bovine serum. RINm5F cells, an insulin secreting β-cell line (29Bhathena S.J. Oie H.K. Gazdar A.F. Voyles N.R. Wilkins S.D. Recant L. Diabetes. 1982; 31: 521-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were cultured by the Washington University Tissue Culture Support Center in RPMI 1640 containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 16.8 mm glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10 mm HEPES. Cells were subcultured in complete CMRL in Petri dishes (60 × 15 mm) at a concentration of 3 × 106 cells/3 ml and incubated at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 for 24 h before initiating experiments. Islets (200/1 ml) and RINm5F cells (3 × 106 cells/3 ml) were washed free of fetal bovine serum and incubated in CMRL, 3 mm glucose, 0.1% BSA at 37 °C, 95% air, 5% CO2 for 0 to 48 h ± TNFα (50 ng/ml ∼ 2.9 nm), IL-1β (5 units/ml ∼ 5.7 pm), aminoguanidine, NMMA, 15d-PGJ2, actinomycin D, or IRAP. IRAP, troglitazone, and 15d-PGJ2 were added 30 min before TNFα or IL-1β. Culture media was collected for accumulated nitrite determinations. Islets were then incubated for 30 min with either 3 or 20 mm glucose ± cytokines, insulin, and inhibitors. RINm5F cells were incubated for 2 h in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRBB) in the absence of glucose and amino acids, followed by a 30-min incubation ±1× amino acid mixture (13Xu G. Kwon G.

Following experimental treatments, cells or islets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in 300 μl or 30 μl, respectively, of Laemmli sample buffer, heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to remove insoluble materials. The supernatants were processed for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting of iNOS or p70s6k as described previously (13Xu G. Kwon G. Marshall C.A. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol.

Quantitation of Western blots was performed by densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics personal densitometer scanning instrument (Sunnyvale, CA). Data are expressed as percent of phosphorylated p70s6k over total. Isolated islets (150/1 ml) were cultured for 48 h at 37 °C in CMRL medium, 8 mm glucose, 0.1% BSA ± TNFα (50 ng/ml), ± aminoguanidine (0.5 mm). In the absence of fetal calf serum, the glucose concentration was raised to 8 mm to maintain the glucose-stimulated insulin secretory response of β-cells. Culture medium was collected for accumulated nitrite measurements, and islets were washed and incubated for 2 h in CMRL, 0.1% BSA, minus glucose. Following this period, islets were washed in KRBB, 3 mm glucose, 0.1% BSA, and groups of 20 islets were placed into 10 × 75-mm siliconized, borosilicate tubes. KRBB was replaced with 200 μl of fresh KRBB, 3 mmglucose, 0.1% BSA, and the islets were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C under 95% air, 5% CO2 in a shaking water bath. Buffer was replaced with 200 μl of KRBB containing 3 or 20 mm glucose, and islets were incubated for 30 min. TNFα and aminoguanidine were present during the entire experiment. Insulin secretion was determined in the incubation buffer by insulin radioimmunoassay at the Radioimmunoassay Core Facility, Diabetes Research Training Center, Washington University Medical Center. Culture media was removed, and 50-μl aliquots were mixed with 50 μl of Griess reagent (31Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10586) Google Scholar). Nitrite production was determined at an absorbance of 540 nm using a Molecular Devices Thermomax platereader (Sunnyvale, CA). Our initial focus was to determine whether preincubation of pancreatic islets in the presence of TNFα would inhibit insulin signaling at concentrations and periods of exposure similar to that used previously with insulin-sensitive cells. As shown in Fig.1 A (lanes 1 and2), islets incubated under control conditions for 48 h and subsequently stimulated with an insulin stimulatory concentration of glucose (20 mm) showed enhanced phosphorylation of p70s6k compared with basal glucose (3 mm), as determined by gel shift analysis. Pretreatment of islets for 48 h with TNFα concentrations of 20 ng/ml or greater reduced phosphorylation of p70s6k to basal or lower levels. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the inhibitory effect of TNFα was detected at 24 h (lanes 5 and 6) and 48 h (lanes 7 and 8). Thus, both the dose and time dependence of TNFα-induced inhibition of p70s6k by pancreatic islets is quite similar to that described previously for TNFα on other aspects of insulin signaling in insulin-sensitive cells. To determine whether TNFα-induced inhibition of p70s6k represents a specific defect in insulin signaling by islets, the ability of exogenous insulin to reverse this inhibition was next evaluated. As shown in Fig. 2,lane 3, pretreatment of islets for 48 h with TNFα (50 ng/ml) resulted in marked inhibition of p70s6k following exposure of islets to an insulin stimulatory concentration of glucose (20 mm) compared with the control in the absence of TNFα (lane 2). Furthermore, this inhibition was not reversed by exogenous insulin over a concentration range of 10–200 nm(lanes 4–6). These findings suggest that TNFα induces insulin resistance in islets similar to insulin-sensitive cells. A possible mechanism to explain these results is that TNFα may mediate serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins, which then functions as an inhibitor of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity (17Hotamisiligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 27: 665-668Crossref Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). Alternatively, our previous studies have demonstrated that proinflammatory cytokines including TNFα, either alone or in synergy with other cytokines, stimulate expression of the inducible isoform of iNOS and the overproduction of NO (32Corbett J.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). NO potently inhibits cellular metabolism by inactivating iron-sulfur-containing enzymes localized primarily in the mitochondria, which results in reduced levels of ATP. Thus, an alternate mechanism to explain the ability of TNFα to inhibit p70s6k activation by islets is that NO mediates a global inhibition of cellular metabolism.Figure 2TNFα-induced inhibition of p70 s6k phosphorylation is not reversed by exogenous insulin. Islets (200 in 1 ml CMRL supplemented with 3 mm glucose and 0.1% BSA) were incubated for 48 h in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml TNFα as indicated. Islets were then stimulated with either 3 or 20 mm glucose for 30 min. For lanes 4 through 5, increasing concentrations of insulin were added in addition to 20 mm glucose. Islets were then processed for SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot for p70s6k as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are representative of three individual experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Studies were performed next to evaluate this possibility. As shown in Fig. 3 A (lanes 3and 4), co-incubation of aminoguanidine (0.5 mm) with TNFα (50 ng/ml) for 48 h completely prevented the inhibition of glucose-stimulated activation of p70s6k. Also, aminoguanidine (0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 mm) in the absence of TNFα at noninsulin stimulatory levels of glucose (3 mm) exerted no effect on basal levels of p70s6k(lanes 6–8). As shown in Fig. 3 B, exposure of islets for 48 h to TNFα (50 ng/ml) also inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and this inhibition was completely reversed by co-incubation with aminoguanidine. Based on these new findings, the ability of exogenous insulin to reverse TNFα-mediated inhibition of p70s6k as described in Fig. 2 was re-evaluated but now in the presence of aminoguanidine, which prevents formation of NO and inhibition of cellular metabolism. As shown in Fig. 4, pretreatment of islets with TNFα (50 ng/ml) for 48 h inhibited p70s6k phosphorylation (lanes 2 and3). Furthermore, exogenous insulin (200 nm) at basal glucose levels (3 mm) in the presence of an inhibitor of iNOS activity, aminoguanidine, completely reversed this inhibition compared with the absence of aminoguanidine (lanes 4 and5). Also shown in Fig. 4 (lane 6), exogenous insulin (200 nm) at basal glucose (3 mm) enhanced phosphorylation of p70s6k similar to elevated glucose (20 mm). These results indicate that although TNFα-induced NO formation inhibits endogenous insulin secretion (Fig.3 B), β-cell insulin resistance is reversed by exogenous insulin providing aminoguanidine is present to prevent inhibition of cellular metabolism (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 5). Thus, β-cell insulin resistance is not because of a decrease in secreted insulin but a defect in insulin signaling by β-cells.Figure 5TNFα and IL-1-induced inhibition of p70 s6k is reversed by aminoguanidine and NMMA . Islets were treated with ±50 ng/ml TNFα, ±5 unit/ml IL-1, ± 0.5 mm aminoguanidine (AG), ± 0.5 mm NMMA for 48 h as indicated. After incubation, islets were stimulated with either 3 or 20 mm glucose for 30 min. Islets were then processed for SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot for p70s6k as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are representative of three individual experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previous studies by Spiegelman et al. (15Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) demonstrate that other proinflammatory cytokines, in particular IL-1, interfered with insulin signaling in cultured 3T3-F442A adipocytes, similar to the effects produced by TNFα (15Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Similar comparisons with pancreatic islets (Fig. 5) indicated that IL-1 also markedly inhibited glucose-stimulated activation of p70s6k(lanes 2 and 6). Furthermore, the inhibitory effects produced by both TNFα and IL-1 were completely prevented by inhibitors of iNOS activity, aminoguanidine and NMMA. To further establish a role for NO as a mediator of TNFα-induced β-cell insulin resistance, Western blot analysis of iNOS expression was performed. As shown in Fig. 6, TNFα (1–50 ng/ml) dose-dependently induced iNOS expression by islets following a 48-h pretreatment. TNFα-induced iNOS expression was blocked by the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D and IRAP (lanes 7 and 8). These latter findings suggest that TNFα mediates iNOS expression by activating intra-islet macrophages, resulting in the release of IL-1 that then acts directly on the β-cell. This mode of action for TNFα was further supported by findings shown in Fig. 7 A, indicating that IRAP reversed in a dose-dependent manner TNFα-induced inhibition of p70s6k (lanes 3 and4–6). As expected, IRAP also prevented IL-1-induced inhibition of p70s6k (lanes 7 and8).Figure 7IRAP reverses TNFα-induced inhibition of p70 s6k .Islets were incubated for 48 h in the presence and absence of 50 ng/ml TNFα ± increasing concentrations of IRAP as indicated. For lanes 7 and8, 5 units/ml IL-1 ± 1 μg/ml IRAP was added as a control. After incubation, islets were stimulated with either 3 or 20 mm glucose for 30 min. Islets were then processed for SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot for p70s6k as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, TNFα has no effect on amino acid-stimulated p70s6k phosphorylation by RINm5F cells.

To do so, we have used a [35S]GTPγS (where GTPγS is guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate) binding assay to quantify the activation of recombinant receptors transiently expressed in COS cells and compared functional responses of D128N, D128A, Y129F, Y129A, and Y308F point-mutated receptors to that of the wild-type receptor. In the absence of ligand, [35S]GTPγS binding was increased for every mutant receptor under study (1.6–2.6-fold), suggesting that all mutations are able to enhance constitutive activity at the receptor. In support of this finding, the inverse agonistN,N-diallyl-Tyr-Aib-Aib-Phe-Leu (where Aib represents α-aminobutyric acid) efficiently reduced basal [35S]GTPγS binding in the mutated receptor preparations. The potent agonist BW373U86 stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding above basal levels with similar (D128N, Y129F, and Y129A) or markedly increased (Y308F) efficacy compared with wild-type receptor. BW373U86 potency was maintained or increased. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the mutations under study increase functional activity of the receptor. Three-dimensional modeling suggests that Asp128 (III) and Tyr308 (VII) interact with each other and that Tyr129 (III) undergoes H bonding with His278(VI). Thus, Asp128, Tyr129, and Tyr308 may be involved in a network of interhelical bonds, which contributes to maintain the δ receptor under an inactive conformation.

Opiates elicit their potent biological actions through three classes of opioid receptors, μ, δ, and κ.

All three opioid receptors are coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gi/Go type, and receptor stimulation by an opioid agonist modulates a number of intracellular pathways (2North R.A. Herz A.

Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of transmembrane signaling at the receptor level.Activation mechanisms of G protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) are being extensively investigated both by computer modeling and mutagenesis or spectroscopy (for reviews see Refs. 5Fong T.M. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 6Scheer A. Cotecchia S. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1997; 17: 57-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Wess J.

Rhodopsin, muscarinic, and adrenergic receptors have been most studied, and a number of hypotheses have been proposed. In particular it has been suggested that transmembrane motions are involved in processes that would make intracellular loops of the receptor accessible to G proteins. Tm-Tm interactions seem to be critical in maintaining the receptor in an inactive conformation, and modifications of H bonding by proton transfer have been suggested as part of the activation phenomenon. The question of how binding interactions do propagate through Tm domains down to intracellular loops and trigger G protein activation has not been solved. It is nevertheless predictable that some residues that belong to the binding pocket may also participate in signaling.According to low structure resolution of bovine rhodopsin (9Schertler G.F. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 770-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 10Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), Tm III and VII are the most buried regions within the helical bundle, with limited access to the lipidic membrane environment, and they most probably interact with each other. We have previously mutated single amino acid residues of Tm III (Asp128 and Tyr129) and VII (Tyr308) of the mouse δ opioid receptor (mDOR) (Fig. 1) and proposed that these residues belong to the opioid binding site and participate in ligand recognition (11Befort K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10161-10168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To investigate whether these residues also participate in the transduction process itself, we have examined the effect of mutations on receptor signaling.The determination of ligand potency and efficacy at mutant recombinant Gi/Go-coupled receptors usually requires the establishment of stable cell lines for each receptor under study. We have recently developed a method to measure opioid receptor activation using transient expression in COS cells and [35S]GTPγS binding (13Befort K. Tabbara L. Kieffer B.L. Neurochem. Res. 1996; 21: 1301-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We now have used this approach to evaluate the effect of D128N and D128A (Tm III), Y129F and Y129A (Tm III), and Y308F (Tm VII) mutations on functional activation of the δ receptor. An important result from this study is the finding that structural modifications in Tm III and Tm VII enhance ligand-independent [35S]GTPγS binding. This is the first report of constitutively active mutant (CAM) opioid receptors.DISCUSSIONHere we have investigated both agonist-dependent and agonist-independent activity of point-mutated δ opioid receptors. Our results show that all the structural changes that we have introduced enhance receptor activity. The most noticeable feature is the observation that each mutation significantly augments ligand-independent receptor-mediated [35S]GTPγS binding activity.Point mutations at adrenergic receptors originally demonstrated that structural modifications of a GPR can trigger agonist-independent activation (23Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S.

Res. 1996; 37: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). For rhodopsin, adrenergic, muscarinic, thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and melanocortin receptors, constitutive activity mostly arises from mutations clustered in Tms II, III, VI, and VII, as well as in the cytoplasmic extensions of Tms III and VI. It has been suggested that these specific receptor domains form a key structure that is central for the activation process and would operate among most GPRs (for reviews see Refs. 5Fong T.M. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 6Scheer A. Cotecchia S. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1997; 17: 57-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Wess J.

CAM were also identified in other receptor areas, including extracellular loops for thrombin (27Nanevicz T. Wang L. Chen M. Ishii M. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 702-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (28Parma J. Van Sande J. Swillens S. Tonacchera M. Dumont J. Vassart G.

Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This suggests the possible existence of receptor-specific activation mechanisms.In this study we have generated constitutive activity at the δ receptor by modifying amino acid residues located in the upper portion of putative helices III (Asp128 and Tyr129) and VII (Tyr308). CAM localized in these particular receptor regions have been described in other GPRs. Some are found at a position homologous to Asp128 and were characterized in rhodopsin (Glu113; see Refs. 30Robinson P.R. Cohen G.B. Zhukovsky E.A. Oprian D.D. Neuron. 1992; 9: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar and 31Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Robinson P.R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Mutations at vicinal positions have also been shown to enhance receptor basal activity both for the α1B-adrenergic receptor (C128F; see Refs. 32Porter J.E. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar and 33Perez D.M. Hwa J. Gaivin R. Mathur M. Brown F. Graham R.M. Mol.

Thus our data showing constitutive activity at D128N, D128A, Y129F, and Y129A mutant δ receptors further strengthen the notion that the exofacial portion of Tm III is critical in receptor signaling. CAMs located at a position homologous to Tyr308 in Tm VII have also been reported. These include mutations at Lys296 in rhodopsin (30Robinson P.R. Cohen G.B. Zhukovsky E.A. Oprian D.D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Again our finding of an enhanced, although modest, basal activity at the Y308F mutant is consistent with findings at other GPRs. Altogether our data suggest that receptor domains that have been shown to be critical for the activation process in previously studied GPRs are also important in opioid receptors.The initial finding that replacement of Ala293 in the α1B-adrenergic receptor by any other amino acid residue increases agonist-independent activity, has led to the notion that a number of critical intramolecular interactions would maintain the receptor under an inactive conformation (23Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1430-1433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this hypothesis, agonists would act by disrupting these conformational constraints and induce a “relaxed” receptor state that in turn would productively interact with G proteins. Compelling evidence has now accumulated, from a wide variety of methodological approaches, to show the importance of interhelical interactions in the allosteric transition between inactive and active receptor states (for a recent review see Ref. 8Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). On the basis of the current hypothesis, it is likely that the three amino acid residues of the δ receptor that we have studied may be part of the stabilizing interhelical network that keeps the receptor inactive. Our results show that conservative mutations in Tm III (D128N and Y129F) and Tm VII (Y308F) trigger constitutive activation of the receptor. Those structural modifications may alter (D128N) or suppress (D128A, Y129F, and Y308F) one hydrogen bond within the helical bundle, and this may be sufficient to enhance conformational flexibility, allowing the receptor to undergo transition from inactive to active state more easily. Further, it seems that the alanine substitution at Tyr129 produces a slightly higher constitutive activation than does the conservative phenylalanine substitution (Fig. 4). We therefore cannot exclude the possibility that the benzene ring of Tyr129 also participates in interhelical stabilization through aromatic-aromatic interaction, as previously suggested (12Befort K. Tabbara L. Kling D. Maigret B. Kieffer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10161-10168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar,37Trump-Kallmeyer S.H.J. Bruinvels A. Hibert M. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 3448-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar).Possible interacting partners of Asp128, Tyr129, and Tyr308 can be hypothesized based on computer three-dimensional modeling. Most models that have been proposed for the δ opioid receptor poorly describe the empty receptor and mainly identify amino acid residues that could potentially interact with opioid ligands (38Alkorta I.

From these models Asp128, Tyr129, or Tyr308 could establish direct hydrogen bonding with a number of agonists, including BW373U86 (Asp128 and Tyr129; see Ref. 38Alkorta I. Loew G.H. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar; Asp128; see Footnote 2). On the assumption that agonist binding induces receptor activation by disrupting pre-existing interhelical interactions, those amino acid residues are good candidates for participating in the structural stabilization of the unliganded receptor. We have further investigated possible Tm-Tm interactions in the absence of ligand using the model of Yue et al. (43Yue S.-Y. Pepin M.-C. Valiquette M. Vu H.-K. Walker P. Roberts E. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1997; 15: 403-404Google Scholar). The model indicates that Asp128in Tm III and Tyr308 in Tm VII could directly interact with each other and be critical in stabilizing the entire helical core (Fig.6). A similar interaction may exist in other GPRs. For rhodopsin, it has been suggested that a salt bridge between the Tm III glutamic acid residue (Glu113), and the Tm VII lysine bond visual chromophore 11-cis-retinal (Lys296) would help maintain the constrained inactive conformation of the native protein (30Robinson P.R. Cohen G.B. Zhukovsky E.A. Oprian D.D. Neuron. 1992; 9: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 31Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Robinson P.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12592-12601Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the α1B-adrenergic receptor, the Tm III residue homologous to Asp128 has been proposed to serve as a counterion for the Tm VII residue homologous to Tyr308, and disruption of this bond was postulated to initiate receptor activation (32Porter J.E. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). There is therefore good indication that Tm III and Tm VII are located in close proximity and also that the existence of a Asp128-Tyr308 interaction could play a role in the activation process. In the model by Yue et al. (Fig. 6) Tyr129, the other Tm III residue that we have studied, forms a hydrogen bond with His278 in Tm VI. The same interhelical hydrogen bond has also been hypothesized in the three-dimensional model proposed by Poda and Maigret (46Poda G. Maigret B. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1998; 5: 1-5Google Scholar). This specific Tm III-Tm VI interaction may be opioid-receptor specific because no homologous interhelical interaction has been reported for other GPRs. In summary, we propose that Asp128 and Tyr129 interact with Tyr308 and His278, respectively, within the unliganded receptor. The mutations would mimic the ligand action by altering those interhelical interactions, thereby facilitating receptor isomerization into an active conformation and/or its interaction with G proteins.Figure 6A molecular model of the unliganded δ opioid receptor. The figure shows a view from the membrane of a three-dimensional model of the empty δ opioid receptor (43Yue S.-Y. Pepin M.-C. Valiquette M. Vu H.-K. Walker P. Roberts E. J. Mol. Graph.

Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the now commonly accepted allosteric ternary complex model (24Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), predict that agonist binding increases binding affinity of the G protein for the receptor and vice versa. As a consequence, CAM receptors presumably imitate the active state of the receptor and are likely to bind agonist ligands with higher affinity, the so-called “high affinity state.” In accordance with this hypothesis, most previously reported CAM GPRs exhibit enhanced affinity for agonists (23Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1430-1433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3401-3407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our data are not concordant with these findings. In a previous report, we have shown that agonist binding is diminished in D128N, Y129F, Y129A, and Y308F mutant δ opioid receptors, and we have suggested that this may be due to the loss of appropriate interactions in the binding pocket (11Befort K. Tabbara L. Bausch S. Chavkin C. Evans C. Kieffer B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 216-223PubMed Google Scholar, 12Befort K. Tabbara L. Kling D. Maigret B. Kieffer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10161-10168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Because we have modified amino acid residues that seem to be involved both in ligand recognition and in the activation process, one cannot exclude that a putative gain of affinity associated with constitutive activity may be masked by the loss of binding interactions between the ligand and the receptor.Further, this observation is not necessarily in opposition with the data obtained at other GPRs. Receptors undergo several processes that include agonist binding, receptor isomerization between active and inactive conformations, and G protein association or dissociation. The relationship between these different steps is complex, the extent to which they are interconnected most certainly depends on the receptor under study and its cellular environment. Each step could be differently influenced by chemical modifications of the receptor (for a review see Ref. 5Fong T.M. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and accumulating data now tend to demonstrate increasing diversity in the properties of CAM receptors. For example, the extent of agonist-induced stimulation appears highly variable, depending on the receptor and the mutation under study. As for the Y308F mutant receptor investigated here, agonist-induced stimulation was augmented in a CAM AT1A angiotensin II mutant receptor (34Groblewski T. Maigret B. Larguier R. Lombard C. Bonnafous J.C. Marie J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1822-1826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), but agonist efficacy was shown diminished for CAM α1B-adrenergic (23Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S.

Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) receptors. This suggests that the active conformations of agonist bond receptors may differ widely from one CAM to another, as well as from that of their wild-type counterparts. Both the localization and nature of the mutation certainly are critical to explain the pharmacological properties of a CAM receptor. Our mutations modify amino acid residues that are involved in at least two steps, namely ligand binding and receptor isomerization. The mutations may have suppressed a number of anchor points for the agonist, as well as Tm-Tm hydrogen bonds, impairing both the ligand recognition process and the stability of the inactive conformation. Full agonist-induced G protein activation, however, is preserved. Therefore, modifications of Asp128, Tyr129, and Tyr308 side chains may have modified the ligand-receptor complex and the receptor itself as well as the receptor-G protein complex, but none of these mutations prevents productive interactions within the ligand-receptor-G protein ternary complex.The activity profile of the Y308F mutant receptor (Tm VII) differed to some extent from that of the Tm III mutant receptors. Most remarkably, Y308F responded significantly better to agonist stimulation. Currently the BW373U86-induced hyperactivation remains unexplained. The finding that Asp128 mutants behave differently from the Y308F receptor suggests that breakage of the proposed Asp128-Tyr308 hydrogen bond is not the only event induced by the site-directed mutagenesis. In addition to the hypothesized direct interaction, Asp128 and Tyr308 could also be involved in other interactions that, in turn, would implicate them differently in the activation process. The role of amino acid residues homologous to Tyr308 has been investigated in other GPRs, by examining agonist-induced responses in mutant receptors. In the angiotensin AT1 receptor, substitution of the equivalent tyrosine (Tyr292) by a phenylalanine did not modify agonist and antagonist peptide binding but impaired angiotensin II-stimulated inositol triphosphate hydrolysis (52Marie J.

A different result was obtained for the m3 muscarinic receptor, where a tyrosine is also found at this position. Mutation into phenylalanine (Y533F) clearly reduced agonist affinity, but maximal stimulation of inositol triphosphate hydrolysis was comparable with that of the WT receptor (53Wess J. Gdula D. Brann M.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3729-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 54Wess J. Maggio R. Palmer J.R. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19313-19319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained for the homologous residue of adenosine receptor (His278), in which substitution with several amino acid residues abolished high affinity binding of agonist and antagonist, whereas the cAMP production was comparable with that of the WT receptor in the H278A mutant (55Olah M.E.

Taxol-induced apoptosis was associated with phosphorylation of both c-Raf-1 and Bcl-2 and activation of ERK and JNK MAP kinases. The serine protease inhibitor N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) effectively blocked apoptosis, but N-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), another serine protease inhibitor, was without effect. TPCK treatment also prevented phosphorylation of c-Raf-1 and Bcl-2 in response to Taxol treatment. The serine protease inhibitor did not alter JNK activity, but it enhanced Taxol-induced activation of ERK1/2. Treatment of cells with the inhibitor of MEK activation, PD98059, prevented Taxol-induced ERK activation both in the presence and absence of TPCK, but did not influence survival of either Taxol- or Taxol plus TPCK-treated cells. In addition, PD98059 had no effect on c-Raf-1 or Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Thus, while the Taxol-induced phosphorylations of c-Raf-1 and Bcl-2 proteins appear to be coupled, these events can be disassociated from ERK1/2 activation. In summary, these findings suggest that phosphorylation of c-Raf-1 and Bcl-2, but not ERK1/2, are important signaling events in Taxol-induced apoptosis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells and that a TPCK inhibitable protease(s) is required for these processes."

To date, there have been no reports in the literature on the structure of substrates or inhibitors when bound to NS3 protease, which would certainly be valuable for inhibitor design efforts. However, x-ray crystal structures have been determined for NS3 protease alone (16Love R.A. Parge H.E. Wickersham J.A. Hostomsky Z. Habuka N. Moomaw E.W. Adachi T. Hostomska Z.

In this report we applied NMR methods to study the structure of peptides and inhibitors, based on N-terminal cleavage products of peptide substrates when bound to the NS3 protease domain of HCV. Transferred NOESY experiments were used to determine the conformation of ligands when bound to the protease, and differential line-broadening experiments were used to identify which segments of the ligands contact the protease. A modification of a previously published procedure (19Steinkühler Urbani A. Tomei L. Biasiol G. Sardana M. Bianci E. Pessi A. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6694-6700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to purify the NS3 protease.Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS, transformed with a pET11d vector expressing amino acids 1–180 of HCV NS3 type 1b, was grown at 37 °C in CircleGrow (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA) medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. At mid-log phase the culture was cooled to 24 °C and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Three hours post-induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell paste was frozen at −80 °C. Following two freeze-thaw cycles the cell paste was resuspended in 3 ml of lysis buffer (25 mmNaPO4, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% octyl-β-d-glucoside, 15 mm NaCl) per gram of cells. The suspension was processed in a Dounce homogenizer, supplemented with 20 mm MgCl2 and 10 μg/ml Dnase I (bovine pancreatic, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and incubated for 20 min on ice. Following a brief sonication, the extract was clarified by a 30-min centrifugation at 14,500 × g. The supernatant was applied to a SP-Sepharose column (equilibrated with 50 mm NaPO4, pH 6.5, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% octyl-β-d-glucoside) and eluted with a 150–1000 mm NaCl gradient. NS3 protease enriched fractions were pooled and diluted with Buffer A (25 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% octyl-β-d-glucoside) to decrease the NaCl concentration to 100 mm. The NS3 protease pool was applied to a heparin-Sepharose column and eluted with 0.3 m NaCl in Buffer A. The eluted protein was concentrated and applied to a Superdex 75 column (in Buffer A with 350 mm NaCl) and eluted as a single major peak of homogeneous NS3 protease (Fig. 1). Purified protein preparations were checked by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and the enzyme concentration was quantified by PTH-derivatization of a total amino acid hydrolysate of the purified protein. A conversion factor of 1.22 was implemented to correct the protein concentration as determined from a Bio-Rad protein assay using a bovine serum albumin standard. The proportion of enzyme in active form was estimated to be greater than 95% based on a comparison of previously published activities (19Steinkühler Urbani A. Tomei L. Biasiol G. Sardana M.

Peptides 1, 2,and 3 (Table I shows the compounds used in this study) were synthesized using standard solid-phase methodology (21Stewart J.M. Young J.D.

The synthesis of 4 was carried out in solution using standard peptide chemistry (22Bodanszky M. Peptide Chemistry. 2nd Revised Ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993Crossref Google Scholar). Each compound was purified by preparative reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 column using an acetonitrile gradient.

The enzymatic assay was performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30% (w/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) CHAPS, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm TCEP. 25 μm of the substrate DDIVPC-SMSY/TW, ∼1 nmbiotin-DDIVPC-SMSY-125I-labeled TW, and various concentrations of inhibitor were incubated with 11 nmprotease for 60 min at 23 °C. These conditions were chosen to obtain < 20% substrate conversion to minimize the effect of product inhibition (12Llinàs-Brunet M. Bailey M. Fazal G. Goulet S. Halmos T. LaPlante S. Maurice R.

The reaction was terminated with the addition of 0.025 N NaOH. The separation of substrate from products was performed by adding avidin-coated agarose beads to the assay mixture followed by filtration. A nonlinear curve fit using the Hill model was then applied to the percent inhibition-concentration data, and 50% effective concentration (IC50) was calculated through the use of SAS (Statistical Software System, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The initial velocities were determined at multiple inhibitor and substrate concentrations under the assay conditions described above in the presence of 22 nmprotease. To minimize the effect of product inhibition, the cleavage rates were only measured during the initial phase of substrate conversion (<20%). Accordingly, the initial rates were linear and displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. K i calculations were performed by nonlinear regression analysis of the velocity data using the GraFit software (version 3.0, Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK) and Equation 1 for competitive inhibition.V=VmaxS(Km(1+I/Ki)+S)Equation 1 Two identical samples were initially prepared for each one-dimensional 1H NMR experiment. Sample tubes (5 mm) containing 2 mm inhibitor were prepared by adding 10 μl of concentrated solutions in Me2SO-d 6 to an aqueous buffer composed of 25 mm Na2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol-d 10, 10% (v/v) glycerol-d 8, and 10% (v/v) D2O spiked with 3-(trimethylsilyl)-proprionic 2,2,3,3-d 4. The final pH values of the solutions were adjusted to 7.0, and buffer was added to a final volume of 600 μl. To one of the samples described above was added a concentrated stock solution of NS3 protease (depending on the experiment, the concentration used ranged between 2.1 to 3.6 mg/ml) in a buffer identical to that employed above, with the exception of 0.01% Nonidet P-40 detergent, such that an inhibitor/protease ratio of 30:1 was typically achieved. All spectra were acquired on a Bruker DRX 600-MHz NMR spectrometer at 30 °C with the exception of the spectra shown in Fig. 2 B, which were acquired on a Bruker AMX 400-MHz NMR. Suppression of the solvent signal was achieved by the use of presaturation or by inserting a 3–9-19 WATERGATE module prior to data acquisition (23Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar, 24Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Phase-sensitive NOESY, total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), and ROESY experiments were acquired using the time-proportional phase incrementation method. NOESY experiments were recorded with mixing times of 100, 200, and 250 ms and a water-selective flip-back pulse prior to the readout pulse (25Lippens G. Dhalliun C. Wieruszeski J.-M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The ROESY experiment was recorded with a 250-ms spin-lock period. Two-dimensional data sets were typically acquired with 2048 points in t 2 and 400 points in t 1. 128 scans were averaged for each NOESY t1 increment and 64 scans for each TOCSYt1 increment. The data were processed and analyzed using XWinNMR and WinNMR software (Bruker Canada, Milton, Ontario) and TRIAD software (Tripos, St. Louis, MO). Data sets were typically zero-filled to yield 2048 × 1024 real points after transformation using a phase-shifted sine bell window function. One-dimensional 13C spectra for T 1relaxation measurements for 4 (36 mm) were acquired at 150 MHz and 27 °C in Me2SO solvent. Inversion recovery experiments were run with power-gated proton decoupling during acquisition. Twelve spectra were acquired corresponding to the τ delays (0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.37, 0.65, 1.0, 1.5, 2.2, 3.0, 5.0, 6.0, and 7.5 s). Each spectrum was acquired by adding 1600 transients and using a relaxation delay of 7.54 s. ROESY and J-coupling data collected in both Me2SO solvent and Buffer A, described above, were found to be similar, suggesting that 4 assumes similar conformational properties in both solvents. The structure of 4 was modeled by a simulated annealing protocol using Discover 95.0 and the CFF95 force field (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). All calculations were performed without nonbonded or coulombic cut-offs and a dielectric constant of 1.0. NMR-derived distance restraints were generated from the NMR data using a method similar to that of Sykes (26Baleja J.D. Moult J. Syrosces B.D. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 87: 375-384Google Scholar). The 27 restraints derived from NOESY distance data were applied as strong (1.8–2.7 Å), medium (1.8–3.5 Å), or weak (1.8–5.0 Å) flat-bottomed potentials having force constants of 50 kcal/mol·Å2. A single, high temperature, unrestrained dynamics run was performed at 1000 K using a time step of 1 fs, with 50 structures collected at 10-ps intervals to generate a starting set of conformations. Each structure was cooled and minimized using the following simulated annealing protocol. The temperature was lowered to 500 K at a rate of 50 K/ps−1 where strong restraints were applied, followed by additional cooling to 250 K (5 K/ ps−1). The remaining restraints were added and cooling to 50 K (0.5 K/ ps−1) was performed followed by restrained minimization to a final gradient of 0.01 kcal/mol−1Å−1. Sixteen low energy, NMR-consistent structures were isolated and are shown superimposed based on the P1–P4 backbone in Fig. 5 A. The root mean square deviation for the backbone heavy atoms of P1–P4 (excluding the acid oxygens of P1) is 0.25 Å. The average total restraint violation energy is 0.14 kcal/mol with a S.D. = 0.13 kcal/mol. The differential line-broadening experiment is a powerful NMR method for detecting protein-ligand interactions of moderate affinity (K d = 10−3 to 10−6m) and for identifying the contact sites on ligands that interact with a target protein (27Ni F. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1994; 26: 517-606Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The relative ease and simplicity of the method makes it particularly attractive. For a protein-ligand complex in fast exchange on the NMR time scale, one can observe changes in the predominant ligand resonances upon addition of less than stoichiometric amounts of protein (e.g. 30:1 ligand to protein ratio). The observed protein-induced changes in ligand resonances are due to the different environments of the ligand hydrogen nuclei in the free and the bound states. We have previously described differential line-broadening and transferred NOESY NMR methods that were successful for determining the structures of inhibitors (28LaPlante S.R. Cameron D.R. Aubry N. Bonneau P.R. Déziel R. Grand-Maı̂tre C. Ogilvie W.W. Kawai S.H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1998; 37: 2729-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and peptides (29LaPlante S.R. Aubry N. Bonneau P.R. Cameron D.R. Lagacé L. Massariol M.-J. Montpetit H. Plouffe C. Kawai S.H. Fulton B.D. Chen Z.G. Ni F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9793-9801Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (based on N-terminal cleavage products of peptide substrates) when bound to human cytomegalovirus serine protease. Based on this experience, our initial aim was to identify whether the N-terminal cleavage products of peptide substrates of NS3 protease also exhibited fast exchange appropriate for line-broadening experiments. The N-terminal cleavage product of an NS5A/5B-derived peptide substrate (1, TableI) was tested for inhibitory activity. The moderate affinity of 1 (IC50 = 68 μm) for NS3 protease suggested that this competitive inhibitor (12Llinàs-Brunet M. Bailey M. Fazal G. Goulet S. Halmos T. LaPlante S. Maurice R. Poirier M. Poupart M.-A. Thibeault D. Wernic D. Lamarre D. Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 1713-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) whould be a good candidate for line-broadening and transferred NOESY studies. A differential line-broadening study began by acquiring 1H NMR spectra of 1 (Fig.2 A) in the absence (blue) and presence of the protease (red). A comparison of these spectra shows changes to specific resonances of1 (Fig. 2 A) that results from fast-exchange binding to the protease (on the NMR time scale). The specific nature of the protease-induced perturbations shown in Fig. 2 A suggests that these segments of 1 likely contact the enzyme (e.g. see the resonances of P4 αH, P1 βCH2, and P4 γCH3/δCH3; residue positions are labeled according to the nomenclature described in Ref. 30Schechter J. Berger A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1970; 257: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Other resonances of nonexchangeable hydrogens did not exhibit significant perturbations upon addition of the protease (e.g. P6 αH and P3 γCH3 in Fig. 2 A). These hydrogen atoms do not experience significantly different environments in their free and bound states and may not directly contact the enzyme. In contrast to the observation of N-terminal product inhibition, peptide 2, which is based on the C-terminal cleavage product of the NS5A/5B-derived peptide substrate, does not bind to the protease. Fig. 2 B shows no difference between the spectrum of free 2 (blue) and the spectrum of 2in the presence of protease (red). Moreover, peptide2 does not inhibit NS3 protease activity (IC50> 2500 μm). To investigate other ligand contact points with NS3 protease, a line-broadening study was performed on 3 (IC50 = 34 μm). This compound is based largely on the P10–P1 sequence of the NS5A/5B cleavage site. A comparison of transferred NOESY data (not shown) and line-broadening patterns for 1and 3 in the presence of the protease shows that the P1–P6 residues bind the protease in a similar mode (e.g. 1 and 3 have similar broadening patterns for P1 βCH2, P3 γCH3, and P4 γCH3/δCH3, shown in Fig. 2, Aand C). However, the lack of protease-induced resonance perturbations for the residues comprising P7–P10 indicate the lack of significant contacts between these residues and the protease (e.g. see the resonances labeled P8 βCH3 and P10 δCH3 in Fig. 2 C). These results are consistent with the observation that extension of the hexapeptide1 N terminus does not increase inhibitory potency (12Llinàs-Brunet M. Bailey M. Fazal G. Goulet S. Halmos T. LaPlante S. Maurice R. Poirier M. Poupart M.-A. Thibeault D. Wernic D. Lamarre D. Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 1713-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Further along in our efforts to design potent inhibitors, we found that a (4R)-benzyloxy substituent on the P2 proline improved inhibitory potency by 7–10-fold. The question arose as to whether or not the benzyl group improves potency by interacting directly with the protease. A line-broadening study was undertaken to help answer this question using 4, which has a (4R)-benzyloxy substituent on the P2 proline and in which the P1 cysteine was replaced by the chemically more stable norvaline (14Llinàs-Brunet M. Bailey M. Déziel R. Fazal G. Gorys V. Goulet S. Halmos T. Maurice R. Poirier M. Poupart M.-A. Rancourt J. Thibeault D. Wernic D. Lamarre D. Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 2719-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although the latter replacement typically reduces the potency of inhibitors (14Llinàs-Brunet M. Bailey M. Déziel R. Fazal G. Gorys V. Goulet S. Halmos T. Maurice R. Poirier M. Poupart M.-A. Rancourt J. Thibeault D. Wernic D. Lamarre D. Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 2719-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), it does favor fast-exchange binding, which is required for line-broadening and transferred NOESY experiments. A rapid, reversible binding of4 to the protease was then confirmed by comparing the1H spectra in Fig. 2 D of free 4(blue) to that of 4 in the presence of protease (red). Specific binding to the active site of the protease was also demonstrated by kinetics and NMR studies. The Dixon and the Cornish-Bowden plots (31Cornish-Bowden Biochem. J. 1974; 137: 143-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) obtained with 4 (Fig.3) are characteristic of a competitive mode of inhibition. Furthermore, the best fit observed by nonlinear regression analysis of these data also shows that 4competitively inhibits the NS3 protease with a K i of 5.4 μm. Also, NMR data illustrate that the protease-induced line broadening observed in Fig. 2 D is lost (black spectrum in Fig. 2 E) upon addition of a more potent inhibitor (IC50 = 0.041 μm). The fortuitous resonance dispersion in the 1H spectrum of4 allowed us to identify most of the hydrogen resonances that are perturbed by the protease. For example, Fig. 2 Dshows that the P2 aromatic ring resonances of free 4 were significantly altered with the addition of the protease, suggesting that this group contacts the protease. Many of the resonances of the side chains of P1, P2, and P4 also exhibited protease-induced line broadening, which helps explain their role in the binding of4 to the protease. A summary of the line-broadening data for resonances of P1 to P4 is illustrated in Fig. 5 C and discussed later. Interestingly, little or no broadening was observed for the side chains of P3 (e.g. see Fig. 2 D), P5, and P6. The lack of protease-induced broadening for the P3 side chain resonances suggests a minimal role in direct binding by this group. It also highlights the conformational role that P3 likely plays in orienting the main chain in the free state for optimal binding to the protease (see below). The exact role of P5 and P6 in binding to the protease is still unclear. The resonances of these residues lack significant protease-induced broadening for the nonexchangeable hydrogen atoms, yet these residues are important for optimal inhibitor potency (12Llinàs-Brunet M. Bailey M. Fazal G. Goulet S. Halmos T. LaPlante S. Maurice R. Poirier M. Poupart M.-A. Thibeault D. Wernic D. Lamarre D. Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 1713-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This would suggest that the acids of the side chains may have an important binding role. Unfortunately, this can not be tested using these NMR methods because of the lack of observable1H resonances for rapidly exchanging hydrogen atoms. However, we have shown elsewhere that the aspartic acid at P5 can be replaced by tert-butylglycine with no loss in inhibitory potency (12Llinàs-Brunet M. Bailey M. Fazal G. Goulet S. Halmos T. LaPlante S. Maurice R. Poirier M. Poupart M.-A. Thibeault D. Wernic D. Lamarre D. Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 1713-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). On the other hand, replacement of the aspartic acid at P6 by alanine results in a significant loss in inhibitory potency. The importance of this acid group is highlighted by the fact that sequence comparisons among isolated HCV strains have revealed a structurally conserved acid residue at the P6 position (10Grakoui A. McCourt D.W. Wychowski C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2832-2843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We applied transferred NOESY methods to determine the structure of4 when bound to NS3 protease. As a control experiment, a NOESY spectrum of free 4 was acquired. Fig.4 B shows a subregion that contains only a few distance-related cross-peaks, as expected for a small molecule of this size. A subsequent NOESY spectrum (Fig.4 A) of the same sample, following addition of NS3 protease (30:1 inhibitor to protease ratio), exhibited many new negative cross-peaks, as expected for a small molecule when bound to a large, slow tumbling macromolecule. Also, the negative cross-peaks present in the spectrum of free 4 (Fig. 4 B) were more intense in the transferred NOESY spectrum (Fig. 4 A). These results indicate a well defined and rapidly reversible binding of4 to the protease. Other changes included the loss of artifact zero quantum cross-peaks (e.g. P1-NH/P1-αH, P3-NH/P3-αH, and P4-NH/P4-αH) observed for free 4 (Fig.4 B) and their replacement with negative NOESY cross-peaks (Fig. 4 A) in the presence of the protease. Upon addition of a more potent inhibitor (IC50 = 0.041 μm) that blocks the active site, the transferred NOESY data of 4in the bound state is lost (Fig. 4 C), and the resulting spectrum resembles that of free 4 (compare Fig. 4,C and B). Having demonstrated that the NOESY cross-peaks in Fig. 4 Aarise from 4 when bound to the protease, an NMR-derived structure of enzyme-bound 4 was obtained through restrained simulated annealing techniques. The NOESY cross-peak volumes were scaled and converted to interproton distance restraints (similar to a method described in Ref. 26Baleja J.D. Moult J. Syrosces B.D. J. Magn. Re"
https://openalex.org/W1992397107,"Expression of the prolactin receptor (PRLR) gene is increased in pancreatic islets during pregnancy and in vitro in insulin-producing cells by growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL). The 5′-region of the rat PRLR gene contains at least three alternative first exons that are expressed tissue-specifically because of differential promoter usage. We show by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis that both exon 1A- and exon 1C-containing PRLR transcripts are expressed in rat islets and that human (h)GH, ovine (o)PRL, and bovine (b)GH increase exon 1A expression 6.5 ± 0.8-fold, 6.8 ± 0.7-fold, and 3.9 ± 0.7-fold and exon 1C expression 4.8 ± 0.4-fold, 4.4 ± 0.6-fold, and 2.5 ± 0.7-fold, respectively. Expression of exon 1B was not detectable. The transcriptional activities of reporter constructs containing the 1A, 1B, or 1C promoter were found to be 22.8-fold, 2.7-fold, and 8.0-fold, respectively, above that of a promoterless reporter construct when transfected into the insulin-producing INS-1 cells. The transcriptional activity of the 1A promoter construct was increased 8.9 ± 1.9-fold by 0.5 μg/ml hGH. Responsiveness to hGH of the 1A promoter was localized to the region from −225 to +81 with respect to the transcription start site. This region contains the sequence TTCTAGGAA that by gel retardation experiments was shown to bind the transcription factors STAT5a and STAT5b in response to stimulation by hGH, oPRL, or bGH. Mutation of this γ-activated sequence-like element completely abolished transcriptional induction of the 1A promoter by hGH. Our results suggest that GH and PRL increase the levels of exon 1A- and 1C-containing PRLR mRNA species and furthermore that the transcriptional activity of the 1A promoter is increased via activation of STAT5a and STAT5b. Expression of the prolactin receptor (PRLR) gene is increased in pancreatic islets during pregnancy and in vitro in insulin-producing cells by growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL). The 5′-region of the rat PRLR gene contains at least three alternative first exons that are expressed tissue-specifically because of differential promoter usage. We show by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis that both exon 1A- and exon 1C-containing PRLR transcripts are expressed in rat islets and that human (h)GH, ovine (o)PRL, and bovine (b)GH increase exon 1A expression 6.5 ± 0.8-fold, 6.8 ± 0.7-fold, and 3.9 ± 0.7-fold and exon 1C expression 4.8 ± 0.4-fold, 4.4 ± 0.6-fold, and 2.5 ± 0.7-fold, respectively. Expression of exon 1B was not detectable. The transcriptional activities of reporter constructs containing the 1A, 1B, or 1C promoter were found to be 22.8-fold, 2.7-fold, and 8.0-fold, respectively, above that of a promoterless reporter construct when transfected into the insulin-producing INS-1 cells. The transcriptional activity of the 1A promoter construct was increased 8.9 ± 1.9-fold by 0.5 μg/ml hGH. Responsiveness to hGH of the 1A promoter was localized to the region from −225 to +81 with respect to the transcription start site. This region contains the sequence TTCTAGGAA that by gel retardation experiments was shown to bind the transcription factors STAT5a and STAT5b in response to stimulation by hGH, oPRL, or bGH. Mutation of this γ-activated sequence-like element completely abolished transcriptional induction of the 1A promoter by hGH. Our results suggest that GH and PRL increase the levels of exon 1A- and 1C-containing PRLR mRNA species and furthermore that the transcriptional activity of the 1A promoter is increased via activation of STAT5a and STAT5b.

Goffin V. Edery M. Binart N. Kelly P.A. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 225-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). One of the target tissues of PRL is the endocrine pancreas where PRL and the related hormones growth hormone (GH) and placental lactogen have been found to be potent growth factors for the pancreatic β-cell and to enhance insulin production and glucose sensitivity of these cells (2Brelje T.C.

Pancreas. 1987; 2: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effects of PRL, GH, and placental lactogen are thought to play an important role in the adaptive growth and function of the β-cells during conditions of increased insulin demands. Insulin-producing cells express both GH and PRL receptors (7Asfari M. De W. Postel-Vinay M.C. Czernichow P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 107: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 8Møldrup A. Billestrup N. Nielsen J.H. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4092-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and in particular the long form of the PRL receptor (PRLR) is up-regulated during pregnancy with a sustained elevation observed during lactation (11Møldrup A. Petersen E.D. Nielsen J.H. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). PRL and GH have been shown to stimulate PRLR mRNA expression in insulin-producing cells in vitro (7Asfari M. De W. Postel-Vinay M.C. Czernichow P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 107: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Møldrup A. Petersen E.D. Nielsen J.H.

The up-regulation of PRLR expression may be an important mechanism in the adaptation of the β-cells to the increased insulin demand during pregnancy. Failure in this pathway may lead to gestational diabetes. The PRLR belongs to the same family as the GH receptor, and they are part of the cytokine receptor superfamily characterized by their ability to activate Janus kinases and STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) (1Bolefeysot C. Goffin V. Edery M. Binart N. Kelly P.A. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 225-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). STATs are latent transcription factors that upon phosphorylation by Janus kinases dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they activate transcription via binding of specific DNA elements termed γ-activated sequence-like elements (GLEs) having the consensus sequence TTCNNNGAA (13Ihle J.N. Stravopodis D. Parganas E. Thierfelder W. Feng J. Wang D.M. Teglund S. Cancer J. Sci. Am. 1998; 4: S84-S91PubMed Google Scholar). GH and PRL have been shown to activate a subset of STAT proteins, namely STAT1, STAT3, STAT5a, and STAT5b (1Bolefeysot C. Goffin V. Edery M. Binart N. Kelly P.A. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 225-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar, 14Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Smit L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Although the physiological significance of GH- and PRL-induced STAT1 and STAT3 activation is still unclear, the generation of STAT5a and STAT5b knockout mice showed that the two STAT5 isoforms have essential roles in a wide range of biological actions of PRL and GH (15Teglund S. McKay C. Schuetz E. van Deursen J.M. Stravopodis D. Wang D. Brown M. Bodner S. Grosveld G. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). In vitro STAT5a and STAT5b have been found to mediate GH- and PRL-induced activation of a number of tissue-specifically expressed genes, including the rat insulin 1 gene (16Galsgaard E.D. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Serup P. Nielsen J.H. Billestrup N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The functional diversity of PRL is reflected by the wide distribution of its receptor. Multiple isoforms of the PRLR have been identified which vary in their sequence and in the length of their intracellular domain (1Bolefeysot C. Goffin V. Edery M. Binart N. Kelly P.A. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 225-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PRLR mRNAs have been found to display heterogeneity in their 5′-untranslated region. Genomic analysis of the 5′-region of the rat and mouse PRLR genes has shown a complex organization with the presence of at least five different first exons that are alternatively spliced onto a common, noncoding exon 2 (17Hu Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Møldrup A. Ormandy C. Nagano M. Murthy K. Banville D. Tronche F. Kelly P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 661-671PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ormandy C.J. Binart N. Helloco C. Kelly P.A. DNA Cell B. 1998; 17: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of three of these first exons, designated 1A, 1B, and 1C (18Møldrup A. Ormandy C. Nagano M. Murthy K. Banville D. Tronche F. Kelly P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 661-671PubMed Google Scholar) or E12, E11, and E13, respectively (17Hu Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), has been studied in the rat and found to be tissue-specifically restricted. Thus expression of exon 1A is predominant in the liver, whereas exon 1B expression has been found exclusively in the gonads. Exon 1C is widely expressed and strongly up-regulated in mammary gland during lactation (17Hu Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Møldrup A. Ormandy C. Nagano M. Murthy K. Banville D. Tronche F. Kelly P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 661-671PubMed Google Scholar). A major transcription start site has been found for exon 1B in rat ovary, and multiple transcription start sites have been identified for both exon 1A and exon 1C in rat liver (17Hu Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Transcription of these first exons is initiated by separate promoters, which are utilized in a tissue-specific manner. The 1A promoter has been found to be active in hepatoma cells and inactive in cells derived from mammary gland. In the proximal part of this promoter we have identified a binding site for the liver-enriched transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4), which may be involved in transcriptional activation of the 1A promoter in liver (18Møldrup A. Ormandy C. Nagano M. Murthy K. Banville D. Tronche F. Kelly P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 661-671PubMed Google Scholar). In the 1B promoter from the rat, a binding site for steroidogenic factor-1 has been identified and shown to be essential for activation of this promoter in gonadal cells (20Hu Z. Zhuang L. Guan X. Meng J. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14263-14271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the mouse 1B promoter lacks a functional steroidogenic factor-1 element and is inactive in gonadal cells. This indicates that the 1C promoter is important for PRLR gene transcription in many tissues across species. Recently, binding sites for the widely expressed transcription factors CAAT-box/enhancer-binding protein β and Sp1 have been reported to regulate the activity of the 1C promoter in hepatic and gonadal cells (21Hu Z.-Z. Zhuang L. Meng J. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26225-26235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is likely that the differential usage of the PRLR promoters enables the complex tissue-specific regulation of PRLR gene expression. The aim of the present study was to determine PRLR promoter usage in pancreatic islets and to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which GH and PRL regulate PRLR gene expression in insulin-producing cells. Recombinant hGH (3 IU/mg) was obtained from Novo Nordisk (Gentofte, Denmark). Bovine (b)GH (0.81 IU/mg) and ovine (o)PRL (30 IU/mg) were purchased from UCB (Brussels, Belgium). Pancreatic islets were isolated from 3–5-day-old Wistar rats (Møllegård, Lille Skensved, Denmark) by the collagenase method (3Nielsen J.H. Endocrinology. 1982; 110: 600-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The islets were cultured free-floating in bacteriological plastic Petri dishes (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) for 3–5 days in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, 20 mm Hepes, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Before the addition of hormones, the islets (5,000 islets/dish) were cultured for 7 days in 15 ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.5% normal human serum. INS-1 cells (22Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) were cultured in complete medium (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in air. Once a week the cells were detached by trypsinization, and the next passage was seeded 1:4. Islets were stimulated for 24 h in the absence or presence of 500 ng/ml hGH, bGH, or oPRL and then harvested by centrifugation. The islets were lysed in RNAzol (Cinna/Biotecx Laboratories International Inc., Houston, TX), and total RNA was extracted using the single step acid-guanidium-thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) as described by the manufacturer. RNA concentrations were determined from optical absorbence at A 260nm. According to the manufacturer's protocol, cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of islet RNA in a volume of 25 μl using the RNase H−reverse transcriptase Superscript II and random primers (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA samples were stored at −20 °C after the addition of 50 μl of 0.1% Triton X-100. The total PRLR mRNA pool in the rat islets was determined by a primer set with exon 10-derived sequences: 5′-GCT GAT GTG TGC AAG CTA GCC GGA A (forward); 5′-GAC ACC TTG GCA TAC TCC TTA CTG G (reverse). To detect PRLR mRNA species containing exon 1A, 1B, or 1C sequences, the following three primers were used as forward primers: 1A, 5′-AGC GAG CTG GAT TCT AGG GAA ACA T; 1B, 5′-AGA GCC ATT CTC CAG TAC TGT GAA T; 1C, 5′-TAA AAT CCC CAG ACG CCG GGT CTT C. The sequence of the common reverse primer was derived from exon 3: 5′-TTG TGG ATC TCA GGT TTC CCT GGT G. The expected lengths of the various PCR products were as follows: PRLR, 340 bp; 1A, 329 bp; 1B, 495 bp; 1C, 396 bp. Furthermore, a primer set with sequences derived from the rat glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PDH) cDNA was included in the PCRs as an internal control: 5′-GAC CTG CAG AGC TCC AAT CAA C (forward); 5′-CAC GAC CCT CAG TAC CAA AGG G (reverse) (24Jensen J. Serup P. Karlsen C. Nielsen T.F. Madsen O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18749-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The expected size of this PCR product was 214 bp. PCR was carried out in 50-μl reactions using 3 μl of cDNA as template. The PCRs contained 50 mm KCl; 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0; 1.5 mm MgCl2; 40 μm dATP, dGTP, and dTTPs; 20 μm dCTP; 2.5 μCi of 3,000 Ci/mmol [α-33P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); 10 pmol of each primer; and 2.5 units of Ampli Taq Gold polymerase (Perkin-Elmer/Roche). A single denaturing step at 94 °C/10 min was followed by 25 cycles as given: 94 °C/30 s; 55 °C/1 min; 72 °C/1.5 min. PCR products were separated on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea, 130 mmTris, 80 mm boric acid, and 0.25 mm EDTA. The gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. In addition the gels were exposed to PhosphorImage storage screens that were scanned by Molecular Dynamics PhosphoImager series 400 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), and band intensities were calculated using the program Image-Quant (Molecular Dynamics). The three luciferase reporter constructs pGL2-1A, pGL2-1B, and pGL2-1C were generated as follows. The 5′-flanking regions of PRLR exons 1A (−999/+81), 1B (−311/+339), and 1C (−417/+200), when expressed in relation to transcription start sites of the individual exons, were inserted into the plasmid pGL2-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) containing the coding region of the firefly luciferase gene, as described previously by Møldrup et al. (18Møldrup A. Ormandy C. Nagano M. Murthy K. Banville D. Tronche F. Kelly P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 661-671PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the 1A promoter 5′-deletion constructs (−462, −404, −356, −255, −225, and −83) were generated by exonuclease III digestion of the pGL2-1A construct (18Møldrup A. Ormandy C. Nagano M. Murthy K. Banville D. Tronche F. Kelly P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 661-671PubMed Google Scholar). The QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to introduce mutations in the GLE of the pGL2-1A construct. The sequences of the two complementary, mutagenic primers were as follows with the mutated bases underlined: 5′-CAA AAT GAG TTC TAG TCA TAA AGA ATA TCA G; 5′-CTG ATA TTC TTT ATG ACT AGA ACT CAT TTT G. The resulting construct (pGL2-1A-mutGLE) was sequenced to ensure that the two point mutations were introduced correctly. The plasmid pRL-SV40 containing the coding region of the Renillaluciferase gene under the transcriptional control of the SV40 early enhancer/promoter was purchased from Promega. INS-1 cells were seeded in 24-well plates (300,000 cells/well) in complete medium. The following day the cells were transiently transfected by the use of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) essentially as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, 1.5 μl of LipofectAMINE and 0.5 μg of DNA (250 ng of one of the firefly luciferase reporter plasmids, 10 ng of pRL-SV40 plasmid (internal control), and 240 ng of pUC18 plasmid (carrier)) were used per well. The cells were transfected overnight in Opti-MEM (250 μl/well). The medium was changed to fresh RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum and incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of hormones as indicated. The cells were harvested in 100 μl of passive lysis buffer (supplied with the DLR assay system, purchased from Promega), and the cell extracts were stored at −80 °C. Firefly andRenillaluciferase activities of the cell extracts were measured with a Turner Designs model 20/20 luminometer (Promega) using the DLR assay system. According to routine, 30 μl of cell extract was measured for a 15-s period at a sensitivity level of 80%. The levels of firefly luciferase activities were in the range of 0.23–1.23 units (pGL2-Basic), 4.41–11.73 units (pGL2-1A), 0.79–1.46 units (pGL2-1B), and 3.57–3.73 units (pGL2-1C); the levels obtained from mock-transfected cells were in the range of 0.09–1.37 units. The levels of Renillaluciferase activities obtained from pRL-SV40-transfected cells were in the range of 83–418 units with the majority of the samples having activities in the range of 100–200.Renillaluciferase activities obtained from mock-transfected cells were in the range of 20–31 units. When calculating the luciferase ratio (firefly luciferase activity above Renillaluciferase activity) the corresponding mock activities were first subtracted. Each DLR assay was repeated three or four times with duplicate samples. INS-1 cells (approximately 2 × 107) were cultured in 150-mm tissue culture dishes for 2 days in complete medium. The medium was changed to fresh medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum, and after 16 h the cells were incubated for 15 min in the absence or presence of 500 ng/ml hGH, bGH, or oPRL as indicated. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in hypotonic buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9; 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm AEBSF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/μl leupeptin, 1 μg/μl aprotinin, 20% glycerol) containing 1% Triton X-100. The nuclei were scraped off and collected by centrifugation after which they were extracted for 30 min on a rocking bench in hypertonic buffer B (buffer A with 400 mm NaCl). The extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and aliquots of the supernatant were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were measured using Bio-Rad protein assay. The double-stranded oligonucleotide 1A-GLE (see Fig. 4 A) was radiolabeled in a fill-in reaction using [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and DNA polymerase (Klenow fragment) and used as probe. Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 20 fmol of probe in a 20-μl reaction containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9; 50 mm NaCl; 1 mmMgCl2; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mmdithiothreitol; 10% glycerol; and 0.1 μg/μl poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). Free and bound probe were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 2% glycerol and 0.25 × TBE (25 mm Tris-HCl, 25 mm boric acid, and 0.25 mm EDTA; pH 7.9). The gels were dried and exposed to autoradiography for 1–2 days. In competition studies, 200 or 2,000 fmol corresponding to 10- and 100-fold molar excess, respectively, of unlabeled 1A-GLE was added to the binding reaction. Alternatively, unlabeled double-stranded mut1A-GLE oligonucleotide (see Fig.4 A) was used as competitor. In supershift studies, nuclear extracts were preincubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 1 μl of either one of the following antibodies: anti-STAT5a and anti-STAT5b (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories, San Francisco, CA); anti-STAT5a+b, which recognizes both STAT5a and STAT5b; and anti-c-Myc, which was included as control antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). We have employed quantitative RT-PCR analysis to determine the expression levels of exons 1A, 1B, and 1C in insulin-producing cells. We first used a primer set specific for exon 10 of the PRLR gene. Exon 10 is present in transcripts encoding the long form of the receptor; and because the long form of the PRLR is the predominant form expressed in islets (11Møldrup A. Petersen E.D. Nielsen J.H. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the majority of PRLR mRNA species in these cells are recognized by this primer set. Using cDNA prepared from cultured rat islets, the expected 340-bp PCR product was detected easily (Fig.1 A, lane 1), and the level was found to be up-regulated by stimulation with bGH, oPRL, or hGH (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2, 3, and4, respectively). It should be noticed that in rodents bGH and oPRL activate GH and PRL receptors, respectively, whereas hGH is known to activate both types of receptors. Correlated to the internal control G6PDH, the level of PRLR mRNA was increased 3.3 ± 0.9-fold by bGH, 5.8 ± 0.1-fold by oPRL, and 6.1 ± 1.2-fold by hGH (Fig. 1 B). These results are in accordance with those obtained by RNase protection assay using a probe specific for the long form of the PRLR (11Møldrup A. Petersen E.D. Nielsen J.H. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Using three upstream primers specific for exons 1A, 1B and 1C and a common downstream primer specific for exon 3 (see Fig. 2 A) we detected exons 1A- and 1C-specific PCR products with the expected sizes of 329 and 396 bp, respectively (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–4 and9–12, respectively), whereas exon 1B expression was not detected (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5–8). Exon 1A expression was found to be up-regulated 3.9 ± 0.8-fold by bGH, 6.8 ± 0.7-fold by oPRL, and 6.5 ± 0.7-fold by hGH, whereas exon 1C expression was found to be up-regulated 2.5 ± 0.4-fold by bGH, 4.4 ± 0.6-fold by oPRL, and 4.8 ± 0.7-fold by hGH (Fig. 2 C). The expression and hormonal regulation of exons 1A, 1B, and 1C were found to be similar in INS-1 cells (data not shown), suggesting that results obtained in the latter cells regarding the mechanism of PRLR gene regulation will apply to primary β-cells as well.Figure 2RT-PCR analysis of the expression and hormonal regulation of PRLR exons 1A, 1B, and 1C in cultured rat islets. Panel A, schematic representation of the genomic structure of the 5′-end of the rat PRLR gene with exons indicated by filled boxes. The locations of the three upstream primers specific for exons 1A, 1B, and 1C and the common downstream primer specific for exon 3 are indicated byarrows. Panel B, RT-PCR was performed and visualized as described in Fig. 1 using cDNA from unstimulated, control islets (lanes 1, 5, and 9) or from islets stimulated with 500 ng/ml bGH (lanes 2,6, and 10), oPRL (lanes 3,7, and 11), or hGH (lanes 4,8, and 12). Primer sets specific for exon 1A (lanes 1–4), 1B (lanes 5–8), and 1C (lanes 9–12) were included in the PCRs together with a primer set specific for the internal control G6PDH. The molecular weight marker is shown in lane 13. Panel C, quantification of the effects of bGH, oPRL, and hGH on the levels of exon 1A- (left panel) and 1C- (right panel) containing transcripts. The levels of exons 1A- and 1C-specific PCR products (329 and 396 bp, respectively) were normalized to G6PDH levels, and the results are expressed as fold induction (mean ± S.D., n = 4) compared with the corresponding control levels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the transcriptional activity of the 1A, 1B, and 1C promoters in insulin-producing cells, we transiently transfected INS-1 cells with firefly luciferase reporter genes under the transcriptional control of the 5′-flanking regions of exons 1A, 1B, and 1C, respectively. As shown in Fig.3 A, the pGL2-1A construct containing the region of the 1A promoter from −999 to +81 relative to transcription start site (18Møldrup A. Ormandy C. Nagano M. Murthy K. Banville D. Tronche F. Kelly P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 661-671PubMed Google Scholar) showed relatively strong promoter activity when analyzed by DLR assay. The transcriptional activity of the pGL2-1A construct was 22.8-fold higher than that of the promoterless pGL2-Basic construct into which the various PRLR promoter fragments have been cloned (luciferase ratios: 7.6 × 10−2 ± 2.0 × 10−2 and 0.3 × 10−2 ± 0.3 × 10−2, respectively). In contrast the promoter activity of the pGL2-1B construct containing the region from −311 to +339 of the 1B promoter was only 2.7-fold higher than that of pGL2-Basic (0.8 × 10−2 ± 0.2 × 10−2). The pGL2-1C construct containing the region from −417 to +200 of the 1C promoter had intermediate promoter activity that was 8.0-fold higher that of pGL2-Basic (2.4 × 10−2 ± 0.9 × 10−2). The transcriptional activity of the pGL2-1A construct was induced 9.2-fold by hGH (70 × 10−2 ± 28 × 10−2). Both oPRL and bGH stimulated the transcriptional activity of the pGL2-1A construct; and although the level of induction obtained with oPRL was similar to that seen with hGH, bGH was found to be less potent (data not shown). Furthermore, the effect of hGH was dose-dependent with a 2.6 ± 0.7-fold induction obtained with as little as 1 ng/ml hGH (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, hGH had no significant effect on the transcriptional activity of the pGL2-Basic, pGL2-1B, and pGL2-1C constructs (0.3 × 10−2 ± 0.1 × 10−2, 1.3 × 10−2 ± 0.5 × 10−2, and 3.6 × 10−2 ± 1.7 × 10−2, respectively) as shown in Fig. 3 A. To identify the region(s) of the 1A promoter which contained putative GH/PRL-responsive element(s) we analyzed a series of 5′-deletion mutants of the pGL2-1A construct which, as mentioned above, contained the region of the 1A promoter from −999 to +81. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the −462, −404, and −356 deletion constructs were similar to the full-length pGL2-1A construct with respect to both basal transcriptional activity and hormonal responsiveness. When expressed as percent of pGL2-1A, the activities were 110 ± 17%, 149 ± 32%, and 148 ± 17% in the absence and 978 ± 192%, 747 ± 53%, and 833 ± 79% in the presence of hGH. Although the basal transcriptional activities of the −255 and −225 constructs were reduced to 49 ± 15% and 14 ± 3%, respectively, these two constructs still responded to hGH with increased promoter activity (358 ± 142% and 62 ± 20%, respectively). In contrast, the transcriptional activity of the −83 construct was not significantly higher than that of the promoterless pGL2-Basic construct neither in the absence nor presence of hGH (5 ± 1% and 6 ± 2%, respectively). These results suggest that a GH/PRL-responsive element is present in the region from −225 to +81. Within the GH/PRL-responsive region of the 1A promoter, we identified a putative GLE with the sequence 5′-TTCTAGGAA located at position −156 to −148 (Fig. 4 A). This putative GL"

By virtue of its interaction with these effector proteins CD22 modulates signal transduction through the B cell antigen receptor. To define further the molecular mechanism by which CD22 mediates its co-receptor function, phosphopeptide mapping experiments were conducted to determine which of the six tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain are involved in recruitment of the stimulatory effector proteins phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Grb2, and Syk. The results obtained indicate that the protein tyrosine kinase Syk interacts with multiple CD22-derived phosphopeptides in both immunoprecipitation and reverse Far Western assays. In contrast, the Grb2·Sos complex was observed to bind exclusively to the fourth phosphotyrosine motif (Y828ENV) from CD22 and does so via a direct interaction based on Far Western and reverse Far Western blotting. Although both PLCγ and PI3K were observed to bind to multiple phosphopeptides in precipitation experiments, subsequent studies using reverse Far Western blot analysis demonstrated that only the carboxyl-terminal phosphopeptide of CD22 (Y863VTL) binds directly to either one. This finding suggests that PLCγ and PI3K may be recruited to CD22 either through a direct interaction with Tyr863 or indirectly through an association with one or more intermediate proteins.

CD22 is a B cell-restricted transmembrane glycoprotein that is also an I-type lectin, which specifically recognizes α2–6-linked sialic acid residues (1Tedder T.F. Tuscano J. Sato S. Kehrl J.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 481-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). CD22 expression is tightly linked with that of membrane IgM and IgD on mature B cells (2Erickson L.D. Tygrett L.T.

Immunol. 1993; 23: 1358-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Moreover, CD22 is phosphorylated rapidly on tyrosine residues in response to BCR cross-linking, and this promotes the recruitment of several effector proteins that contain Src homology 2 (SH2) domains (1Tedder T.F. Tuscano J. Sato S. Kehrl J.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 481-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). By virtue of its ability to recruit intracellular effector proteins, CD22 functions as a co-receptor that is able to modulate B cell activation in response to BCR cross-linking (6Doody G.M.

CD22 contains three immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs in its cytoplasmic domain, similar to other inhibitory co-receptors (10Cambier J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5993-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of CD22 promotes the recruitment of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, which has been shown to regulate signal transduction negatively via growth factor and cytokine receptors (6Doody G.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20305-20308Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain-mediated binding of SHP-1 to CD22 results in potentiation of its catalytic activity (6Doody G.M. Justement L.B. Delibrias C.C. Matthews R.J. Lin J. Thomas M.L. Fearon D.T. Science. 1995; 269: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Thus, it was hypothesized that recruitment of SHP-1 to the CD22·BCR complex is responsible for attenuation of signal transduction. Independent ligation of CD22 using immobilized anti-CD22 mAb was observed to potentiate B cell proliferation in response to anti-Ig and interleukin-4 and actually decreased the threshold of stimulus required by more than 10-fold (6Doody G.M. Justement L.B. Delibrias C.C. Matthews R.J. Lin J. Thomas M.L. Fearon D.T. Science. 1995; 269: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). This finding was interpreted as providing evidence that sequestration of CD22 away from the BCR leads to enhanced signal transduction. Furthermore, co-cross-linking experiments in which CD22 is co-localized in the membrane with the BCR complex leads to suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (13Tooze R.M. Doody G.M. Fearon D.T. Immunity. 1997; 7: 59-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Additional proof that CD22 negatively regulates signal transduction via the BCR has been provided by a series of studies examining the B cell compartment in CD22-deficient mice, revealing that the loss of CD22 expression causes B cells to become hyperresponsive to acute stimulation through the BCR (14O'Keefe T.L.

Although the studies described above indicate that CD22 functions as an inhibitory co-receptor, existing evidence indicates that CD22 may transduce stimulatory signals under certain circumstances. It has been shown that BCR cross-linking promotes the recruitment of multiple stimulatory effector proteins to CD22 including Syk, phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and Lyn (18Tuscano J.M. Engel P. Tedder T.F. Agarwal A. Kehrl J.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 226: 1246-1252Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 19Wienands J. Freuler F. Baumann G. Int.

Additionally, it has been shown that human tonsilar B cells lacking CD22 are unresponsive to stimulation through the BCR based on their inability to mobilize Ca2+ or to proliferate (22Pezzutto A. Rabinovitch P.S. Dorken B. Moldenhauer G. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1791-1795PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that expression of CD22 and its association with stimulatory effector proteins could be involved in potentiating signal transduction through the BCR (18Tuscano J.M. Engel P. Tedder T.F. Agarwal A. Kehrl J.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 226: 1246-1252Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 19Wienands J. Freuler F. Baumann G. Int.

Med. 1996; 183: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Experiments have also demonstrated that ligation of CD22 alone can indeed deliver stimulatory signals to the B cell independent of BCR cross-linking. Incubation of tonsilar B cells in the presence of an anti-CD22 mAb that blocks binding of CD22 to ligand induces proliferation and antibody production in the presence of interleukin-2 (21Tuscano J. Engel P. Tedder T.F. Kehrl J.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 4723-4730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the anti-CD22-blocking mAb induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD22 and recruitment of stimulatory effector proteins (21Tuscano J. Engel P. Tedder T.F. Kehrl J.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 4723-4730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that engagement of CD22 by CD22 ligand(s) may induce a stimulatory signal independent of BCR cross-linking. Delineation of the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the function of co-receptors like CD22 will yield important insight regarding the factors that regulate the balance between tolerance and immunity. Because CD22 exhibits the ability to recruit both inhibitory (i.e. SHP-1) and stimulatory effector (i.e. Syk, PLCγ, and PI3K) proteins, it is essential to define further the nature of these interactions to develop an understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the function of CD22. Toward this goal, phosphopeptides were synthesized based on the cytoplasmic domain of murine CD22 and were used to identify the binding sites for several stimulatory effector proteins. The results obtained indicate that the three distal tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of CD22 are involved in the recruitment of stimulatory effector proteins and that all of the effector proteins studied exhibit direct binding either to native phosphorylated CD22 or CD22-derived phosphopeptides. Finally, the current study has identified a novel interaction between CD22 and the Grb2·Sos complex. Biotinylated phosphopeptides derived from CD22 (see Fig. 1) were purchased from Quality Controlled Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA). Additionally, six control peptides were also purchased from Quality Controlled Biochemicals in which the tyrosine residues were changed to phenylalanine. Antibodies used in these studies included mouse anti-bovine PLCγ1 mixed monoclonal antibody (IgG isotype, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), rabbit anti-rat PI3K whole antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology), polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse Syk antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), polyclonal rabbit anti-Grb2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and mouse anti-Sos1 monoclonal antibody (IgG3 isotype, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). The anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) mouse monoclonal antibody 4G10 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Additional antibody reagents used in Western blotting included goat anti-mouse Ig conjugated to HRP and goat anti-rabbit Ig conjugated to HRP (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). Streptavidin conjugated to HRP was also purchased from BIOSOURCE. Dr. K. Mark Coggeshall (Ohio State University, Columbus) provided the polyclonal rabbit anti-glutathioneS-transferase (GST) antibody used in these studies. The B lymphoma cell line K46-17μmλ (K46) was generously provided by Dr. Michael Reth (Max Planck Institute for Immunobiology, Frieburg, Germany). K46 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml streptomycin-penicillin, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Sigma Chemical Co.) at 37 °C under 7% CO2. GST fusion proteins were produced as described below. The plasmids encoding GST-Grb2-SH2 and GST-Grb2-SH2/3 fusion proteins as well as the GST-Syk-SH2 fusion protein have been described previously (19Wienands J. Freuler F. Baumann G. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1701-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding the GST-PLCγ fusion protein containing the NH2- and COOH-terminal SH2 domains of PLCγ was provided by Dr. K. Mark Coggeshall (Ohio State University). The plasmid encoding the GST-PI3K fusion protein containing the NH2- and COOH-terminal SH2 domains of the p85 subunit was obtained from Dr. Gordon Mills (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). Bacteria containing the GST fusion protein constructs were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 mm glucose. Bacterial growth was monitored byA 600 nm, and once a value of 0.6–0.8 was reached GST expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration ranging from 0.2 to 3 mm. The bacterial culture was induced overnight at room temperature on a shaker (100 rpm). The next day the bulk culture was harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 5,000 rpm (Sorvall GS-3 rotor) and the supernatant drained. The bacterial pellet was vortexed prior to resuspension with TBS (Tris-buffered saline) with complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Next, the resuspended bacteria were sonicated five times for 1 min with 2-min incubations on ice between each pulse. 10% of the resulting volume of the bacterial lysate was mixed with 10% Triton X-100 Surfact-Amps (Pierce) and the lysate rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. Afterward, the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. The GST fusion proteins were recovered from the supernatant solution by the addition of 1–2 ml of a 50% (v/v) suspension of glutathione-Sepharose resin (Sigma) equilibrated in 1% Triton X-100 and TBS buffer and rotated overnight at 4 °C. The next day the glutathione beads were washed, and the GST fusion protein yield was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. K46 cells were used at a concentration of 2 × 107 cells/sample. After harvesting the cells, the cells were stimulated with goat anti-mouse IgG/M/A (Fab′)2 (2 μg/ml) for various time points or stimulated with pervanadate if needed. Stimulation of the cells was terminated by diluting the cell suspensions with ice-cold PBS. The cells were washed three times and lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40). The lysates were precleared by centrifugation and incubation with streptavidin-conjugated beads (Sigma). Subsequently, biotinylated phosphopeptides or control peptides were added at a final concentration of 10 μm. Peptide-effector protein complexes were recovered using streptavidin-conjugated beads. The precipitates were then washed in 0.2% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS-PAGE reducing sample buffer. The samples were boiled, and the precipitated proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE after which the proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 10% milk and probed with antibodies. The recovery of specific effector proteins was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). If needed, the nitrocellulose membranes were stripped by incubating the membranes in stripping buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 2.3) for 1 h at 60 °C. Then the membranes were washed with TBST (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.005% Tween 20) and reprobed. The Far Western assay employed was adapted from previous protocols (23Celenza J.L. Carlson M.

K46 cells (2 × 107cells/sample) were stimulated with F(ab′)2 fragments of polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse IgG/M/A (2 μg/ml), pervanadate, or they were left untreated. Diluting cell suspensions with ice-cold PBS terminated stimulation of the cells. Afterward, cells were washed three times and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The lysates were precleared by centrifugation and the addition of Sepharose 4B beads conjugated to the irrelevant mAb RG7. After preclearing, the lysates were incubated with anti-CD22 mAb (CY34) coupled to Sepharose 4B beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed, and the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, after which the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immobilized proteins were denatured for 30 min by incubating the membranes with 6 m urea in HEPES balanced buffer (HBB, 25 mm hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Subsequently, the proteins were renatured by progressive dilution of urea in HBB and incubated overnight at 4 °C in 0.1 mm urea and HBB with shaking. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in HBB and later incubated overnight in hybridization buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 75 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1% milk) containing GST fusion proteins at a concentration of 0.1–4 μg/ml). Next, the membranes were washed three times for 5 min each in HBB and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with polyclonal rabbit anti-GST antibody. Again, the membrane was washed briefly and incubated with a tertiary antibody (goat anti-rabbit Ig HRP) and the blots developed by chemiluminescence. The reverse Far Western assay was adapted from previous work (27Tridandapani S. Kelley T. Pradhan M. Cooney D. Justement L.B. Coggeshall K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 10% milk and TBST the membranes were incubated with the appropriate biotinylated CD22 phosphopeptide or control peptide at a final concentration of 100 nm. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the membranes were washed in TBST three times for 5 min and incubated with streptavidin-HRP. The interaction between GST fusion proteins and phosphopeptides was visualized using ECL. The cytoplasmic domain of CD22 contains six tyrosine residues that are conserved between mouse and man (1Tedder T.F. Tuscano J. Sato S. Kehrl J.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 481-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Based on previous studies, it is apparent that one or more tyrosine residues are phosphorylated in response to BCR cross-linking, thereby generating Tyr(P) motifs that are able to recruit SH2 domain-containing effector proteins. To explore the potential role of CD22 Tyr(P) motifs in the recruitment of effector proteins, we synthesized 12 peptides (10 amino acids each) based on the sequence of murine CD22 (Fig.1). Six peptides were synthesized in which the tyrosine residue of each was phosphorylated (phosphopeptides 1–6). Six complementary peptides were generated in which the tyrosine residues were replaced with phenylalanine (Y → F peptides 1–6) to prevent phosphorylation when added to cell lysates. These peptides were then incubated with lysates from unstimulated K46 B lymphoma cells to determine whether they were able to interact with SH2 domain-containing effector proteins. Based on Western blot analysis several stimulatory effector proteins were observed to associate with CD22 phosphopeptides, including PLCγ, PI3K, Grb2, and Syk (Fig.2). The ability of PLCγ, PI3K, and Syk to bind to phosphopeptides derived from CD22 is in agreement with previous work from other laboratories (6Doody G.M. Justement L.B. Delibrias C.C. Matthews R.J.

However, the recruitment of Grb2 is a novel observation. The CD22 phosphopeptides have also been used to immunoprecipitate SHP-1, SHP-2, and SHIP from B cell lysates (27Tridandapani S. Kelley T.

With the exception of Grb2, which bound specifically to phosphopeptide motif 4 containing Tyr828, the other effector proteins were observed to interact with multiple phosphopeptides, although with varying affinities. Syk bound to phosphopeptide motifs 2, 3, 5, and 6, exhibiting the greatest affinity for the motifs containing Tyr783 and Tyr863. PLCγ and PI3K exhibited a binding preference for CD22 phosphopeptide motif 6 containing Tyr863, although both PI3K and PLCγ also associated to a lesser extent with motif 4. Finally, PLCγ was observed to interact weakly with motif 2. Subsequent experiments revealed that in all cases, the interaction of PLCγ, PI3K, Syk, and Grb2 with peptide was dependent on the presence of Tyr(P) (Fig.3; Syk data not shown). Although these studies indicate that multiple effector proteins can bind to CD22 in a Tyr(P)-dependent manner, it was not possible to determine whether the interactions resulted from the direct binding of effector proteins to CD22-derived phosphopeptides. Additionally, it was not possible to determine if the interactions between effector proteins and specific motifs derived from CD22 are physiologically relevant because studies have not been performed to identify the specific tyrosines that are phosphorylated in the cytoplasmic domain of CD22. The association of Grb2 with CD22 phosphopeptide motif 4 represents a novel interaction between CD22 and a stimulatory effector protein. Therefore, additional studies were performed to determine whether Grb2 co-precipitates with native CD22 from activated B cells. K46 cells were incubated in medium alone or in the presence of anti-Ig antibody or pervanadate to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of CD22 after which the cells were lysed, and CD22 was immunoprecipitated. Experiments demonstrated that Grb2 is inducibly recruited to CD22 in response to stimulation of B cells with F(ab′)2 fragments of polyclonal anti-Ig or pervanadate (Fig. 4). As expected, binding of Grb2 correlates with tyrosine phosphorylation of CD22 as demonstrated by stripping and reprobing the membrane with anti-Tyr(P) mAb. These results clearly demonstrate the recruitment of Grb2 to CD22 in response to stimulation of the B cell through the BCR complex. Next, Far Western and reverse Far Western assays were performed to determine if Grb2 binds directly to CD22 or whether it is recruited via an intermediate linker protein. For the Far Western assay, K46 cells were incubated in medium alone or were stimulated either with F(ab′)2 fragments of polyclonal anti-Ig or pervanadate. CD22 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitrocellulose. CD22 derived from untreated or activated B cell was probed with GST fusion proteins containing the SH2 domain of Grb2. Binding of fusion proteins to CD22 was detected by incubating the filters with anti-GST antibodies. The results revealed that the SH2 domain of Grb2 but not the fusion partner GST alone was able to interact with CD22 (Fig. 5). The interaction was only observed under conditions that led to tyrosine phosphorylation of CD22, as detected by anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting of the membranes after they had been stripped. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that Grb2 binds directly via its SH2 domain to phosphorylated Tyr828 in the cytoplasmic tail of CD22. To examine further this possibility reverse Far Western blotting was used to determine whether the CD22 phosphopeptide corresponding to motif 4 (Tyr828) was able to interact with the recombinant SH2 or SH2/SH3 domain of Grb2. GST alone, GST-Grb2-SH2, or GST-Grb2-SH2/3 fusion proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and were transferred to nitrocellulose after which the membranes were probed with biotinylated phosphopeptides representing the six motifs from CD22. Peptide binding was detected using streptavidin coupled to HRP and chemiluminescence. Only phosphopeptide motif 4 bound to the Grb2 fusion protein (data not shown). The specificity of peptide binding in the reverse Far Western assay is demonstrated in Fig.6. As depicted, phosphopeptide 4 bound to the Grb2 SH2 domain but not to GST alone. In contrast, the Tyr → Phe mutant peptide did not bind to Grb2 even though the GST-Grb2 fusion proteins were present at equal levels on the membrane (Fig. 6,lower panels). Together, these data show that the SH2 domain of Grb2 is capable of specific and exclusive binding to CD22 at Tyr828. Grb2 is an adapter protein that stimulates Ras activation by engaging and promoting membrane translocation of Sos, a Ras-specific guanine nucleotide exchange enzyme, to the membrane (28Gale N.W.

Science. 1993; 260: 1338-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that Sos is co-localized with Grb2 in CD22 phosphopeptide precipitates, lysates from unstimulated K46 cells were incubated with phosphorylated or Tyr → Phe peptides corresponding to the motif containing Tyr828, or as a negative control, Tyr783. Immunocomplex proteins precipitated by these CD22 peptides were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were probed with antibodies directed against Grb2 or Sos. The results depicted in Fig. 7demonstrate, as shown previously, that Grb2 specifically associates with the phosphopeptide containing Tyr828 but not Tyr783. The studies also demonstrated that binding of Grb2 to CD22 phosphopeptide 4 recruits Sos into the complex (Fig. 7). Finally, experiments were performed demonstrating the recruitment of Sos to native phosphorylated CD22 isolated from K46 cells that had been stimulated with anti-Ig antibody (data not shown). Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of native CD22 promotes recruitment of Grb2, which binds to Tyr828 via its SH2 domain, and this in turn leads to localization of the Ras-activating enzyme Sos. It has been demonstrated previously in human B cells that PI3K physically associates with CD22 (18Tuscano J.M. Engel P. Tedder T.F. Agarwal A. Kehrl J.H. Eur. J.

Whereas human CD22 contains an ideal motif (Y(PO4)XXM, 31) that would be predicted to bind to the SH2 domains of PI3K, murine CD22 does not (1Tedder T.F. Tuscano J. Sato S. Kehrl J.H. Annu. Rev.

Three different lipid modifications tether heterotrimeric G proteins to membranes: α subunits are myristoylated and/or palmitoylated, and γ subunits are prenylated. In a previous study, we examined the role of lipid modifications in maintaining the membrane attachment of a G protein α subunit, αz, which is myristoylated and palmitoylated (Morales, J., Fishburn, C. S., Wilson, P. T., and Bourne, H. R. (1998) Mol. Biol. Cell 9, 1–14). Now we extend this analysis by characterizing the mechanisms that target newly synthesized αz to the plasma membrane (PM) and analyze the role of lipid modifications in this process. In comparison with newly synthesized αs, which is palmitoylated but not myristoylated, αz moves more rapidly to the membrane fraction following synthesis in the cytosol. Newly synthesized αz associates randomly with cellular membranes, but with time accumulates at the PM. Palmitoylated αz is present only in PM-enriched fractions, whereas a nonpalmitoylated mutant of αz (αzC3A) associates less stably with the PM than does wild-type αz. Expression of a C-terminal fragment of the β-adrenoreceptor kinase, which sequesters free βγ, impairs association of both αz and αzC3A with the PM, suggesting that the α subunit must bind βγ in order to localize at the PM. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which, following synthesis on soluble ribosomes, myristoylated αz associates randomly and reversibly with membranes; upon association with the PM, αz binds βγ, which promotes its palmitoylation, thus securing it in the proper place for transmitting the hormonal signal.

Accurate signal transmission from cell surface receptors to intracellular effectors requires that the appropriate signaling proteins interact to form highly co-ordinated pathways. This coordination depends critically on the correct cellular locations of the participating proteins. Heterotrimeric G proteins are peripheral membrane proteins, localized at the plasma membrane (PM), 1The abbreviations used are: PM, plasma membrane; βARK, β-adrenoreceptor kinase; ct, C terminus; BFA, Brefeldin A; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HA, hemagglutinin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SNAP-25, synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa; IM, intracellular membrane; mAb, monoclonal antibody.1The abbreviations used are: PM, plasma membrane; βARK, β-adrenoreceptor kinase; ct, C terminus; BFA, Brefeldin A; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HA, hemagglutinin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SNAP-25, synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa; IM, intracellular membrane; mAb, monoclonal antibody. which convey signals from activated receptors to downstream effectors (1Hamm H.E.

Covalent lipid attachments on the α subunit and on the heterodimeric βγ subunit tether G proteins to the cytoplasmic face of membranes: isoprenylation of the γ-polypeptide at its C terminus provides a strong hydrophobic anchor for βγ, whereas α subunits are modified at their N termini by myristoylation and/or palmitoylation (3Wedegaertner P.B.

G proteins must localize at the PM in order to interact with receptors and many of their effectors. How they reach the PM following their synthesis on ribosomes is not well understood. In a previous study, we examined the role of lipid modifications in maintaining the membrane attachment of G protein α subunits (6Morales J. Fishburn C.S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We now extend this analysis by characterizing the mechanisms that target newly synthesized α subunits to the PM and analyze the role of lipid modifications in this process. Posttranslational lipid modifications can control the association of otherwise cytosolic proteins with membranes. Studies of Ras, Src kinases, and the myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate show that a combination of two membrane-binding signals enables each of these proteins to associate specifically and tightly with its target membrane (7Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 8McLaughlin S. Aderem A.

For G protein α subunits in the αifamily, these two signals are the fatty acyl chains myristate and palmitate (4Jones T.L.Z. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L.Z. Simonds W.F. Weinstein L.S. G Proteins. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 49-65Google Scholar, 6Morales J. Fishburn C.S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Linder M.E. Middleton P.

Myristate and palmitate are 14- and 16-carbon saturated fatty acids that together provide high membrane avidity for the α subunit (reviewed in Ref. 11Bhatnagar R. Gordon J.I. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 14-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The different properties of these lipids suggest, however, that their functional roles differ also. Whereas myristoylation occurs co-translationally in the cytosol, palmitoylation takes place posttranslationally in the membrane fraction. Myristate is attached via a stable amide linkage to an N-terminal glycine residue, and by itself provides only weak attachment to membranes. Palmitate is bound by a reversible thioester linkage to cysteine residues, and its greater hydrophobicity provides approximately 15-fold stronger membrane affinity, as compared with myristate (11Bhatnagar R. Gordon J.I. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 14-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition to providing hydrophobicity, palmitate helps determine the subcellular location of a protein. Mutation of the palmitoylated cysteines in α subunits, Ras and Src kinases causes these proteins to mislocalize and redistribute from the PM to intracellular membranes (6Morales J. Fishburn C.S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12Song J. Dohlman H.G.

Cell. 1997; 8: 1159-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Conversely, cytosolic proteins translocate specifically to the PM when fused to the N-terminal palmitoylated sequence of a Src kinase (16van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Zlatkine P. Mehul B. Magee A.I. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 673-679PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these roles, palmitate and myristate may mediate or modulate direct protein-protein interactions; for example, βγ shows greater affinity for αs or αi subunits when they are palmitoylated or myristoylated, respectively (10Linder M.E.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In an earlier study, we presented immunocytochemical evidence that palmitate enables G protein α subunits to associate specifically with the PM, whereas myristate and βγ stabilize both membrane attachment and the presence of palmitate (6Morales J. Fishburn C.S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here, we have sought to determine how newly synthesized G protein α subunits are targeted specifically to the PM, their functional location in the cell. Using metabolic labeling and biochemical fractionation on sucrose density gradients, we have followed the subcellular location of newly synthesized recombinant αz in CHO cells. The results of these experiments confirm and extend our previous inferences from immunocytochemistry. Moreover, they suggest a model in which, following synthesis, myristoylated αz associates randomly and reversibly with cellular membranes until it reaches the PM, where association with βγ and attachment of palmitate trap it at the appropriate location for transmitting the hormonal signal. Glu-Glu monoclonal antibody (EE mAb) was provided by Onyx Pharmaceuticals (Richmond, CA); 12CA5 monoclonal antibody against hemagglutinin (HA) was obtained from Berkeley Antibody Co. (Berkeley, CA). Na+/K+-ATPase antibody was kindly provided by J. W. Nelson (Stanford University, Stanford, CA), p58 antibody by J. Saraste (University of Bergen, Norway), C-terminal fragment of the β-adrenoreceptor kinase (βARK-ct)-adenovirus vector (20Drazner M.H. Peppel K.C. Dyer S. Grant A.O. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Clin.

FLAG-tagged μ opioid receptor was provided by M. von Zastrow (University of California, San Francisco, CA). CHO-KI cells were propagated in minimal essential medium α with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) (complete medium) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Cells were transfected and stable cell lines established as described previously (6Morales J. Fishburn C.S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Transient transfection with the βARK-ct-adenovirus and LacZ-adenovirus vectors was performed by incubating 4 × 106 cells/100-mm plate in 2 ml of serum-free minimal essential medium α containing 40 μl of concentrated virus stock for 2 h, followed by addition of 8 ml of complete medium and incubation overnight. Cells were replated the following day and used in experiments 48 h after transfection. CHO-KI cells (∼2 × 107/150 mm plate), stably expressing the epitope-tagged αz (αzEE), αzC3A (αzC3A-EE), αs(αsHA), or FLAG μ opioid receptor, were starved for 1 h in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-H21 with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (starvation medium). Cells were then pulse-labeled for 10 min except where indicated otherwise, in starvation medium containing 350 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine ([35S]EXPRESS protein labeling mix) in 3 ml per 150-mm dish. For pulse-chase experiments, labeling medium was removed, and cells were incubated in complete medium containing excess cold methionine (chase) for the time indicated. Where indicated, Brefeldin A (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI) was added at 10 μg/ml during starvation, pulse, and chase periods. For [3H]palmitate labeling experiments, cells were washed in Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 4 h in serum-free minimal essential medium α containing 5 mm sodium pyruvate and 1.0 mCi/ml [3H]palmitate. For each condition, one confluent 150-mm plate was metabolically labeled and then washed in ice-cold Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were scraped and pelleted by low-speed centrifugation and resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin)). Cells were preswelled on ice for 10 min and then homogenized by passing though a 27 gauge needle 15 times. Homogenates were spun at 6000 rpm (1000 × g) for 10 min to remove unlysed cells and nuclei; postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 60,000 rpm (100,000 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C in a TLA100.3 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). Pellet (P100) fractions were resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer, and proteins were extracted and immunoprecipitated as described below. For sucrose density centrifugation, 3 × 150-mm confluent plates were metabolically labeled, and cell pellets were prepared as described above. Cells were resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgSO4, containing protease inhibitors (0.8 ml/150-mm plate) and homogenized as described above. Following a 10-min centrifugation at 6000 rpm, the postnuclear supernatant fraction was layered onto a 0.8-ml 75% (w/v) sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 60,000 rpm (100,000 ×g) for 45 min at 4 °C in a TLA100.3 ultracentrifuge rotor (Beckman Instruments). The membrane fraction was collected at the interface of the sucrose cushion and the supernatant fraction (cytosol), and was brought to 50% sucrose in 2 ml; this was loaded at the bottom of a discontinuous sucrose gradient containing 45% (1.5 ml) and 2 ml each of 40, 35, 30, 25, and 15% (w/v) sucrose in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The gradient was centrifuged in an SW41 rotor for 16 h at 25,600 rpm (150,000 × g); 1.2-ml fractions were collected, and 0.8 ml per fraction was used for immunoprecipitation of proteins (below). For analysis of marker proteins, 200 μl per fraction was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and used in Western analysis by immunoblotting with antibodies to Na+/K+ -ATPase (PM) and p58 (cis-Golgi). Endoplasmic reticulum was detected using a neutral α-glucosidase I assay; briefly, 20 μl of each sample was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.2 mg/ml 4-methyl-umberiferyl α-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma) in 0.1 mNa2HPO4, 0.1% Triton X-100. Reactions were terminated by adding 2 ml of 50 mm glycine/NaOH, and fluorescence was read at λex 365 nm, λem490 nm in a fluorometer. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA method (Pierce). For extraction of α subunits, fractions were incubated in Buffer A (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% sodium cholate, with protease inhibitors) on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm (10,000 × g) at 4 °C. Triton X-100 and SDS were added to cholate extracts of fractions to final concentrations of 1 and 0.5% respectively. Following preclearing with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 20 min at 4 °C, samples were tumbled with protein G-Sepharose beads and EE mAb or 12CA5 mAb for 1 h. Pelleted beads were washed three times in Buffer A plus 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, and then resuspended in SDS-sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, dried, and quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). [3H]Palmitate-labeled samples were run on duplicate 10% gels and then treated with either 1 m Tris (pH 7.0) or 1m hydroxylamine (pH 7.0) for 12 h. Gels were fixed in 50% methanol/10% acetic acid, treated for 30 min with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed for 1 month to HyperfilmTM-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for fluorography. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred onto Immobilon PTM membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and probed with EE mAb at 3 μg/ml, and antibodies to Na+/K+-ATPase and p58 at 1:1,000 dilution. Secondary antibodies with conjugated horseradish peroxidase were used at 1:5,000 dilution and bands were visualized by ECL (NEN Life Science Products). Quantitation of Western blots was performed using an Ultroscan XL (LKB Instruments) and NIH Image 5.17 software. We quantitated the cellular content of endogenous αi and recombinant αz-wild-type or αz-C3A by immunoblotting cell extracts with an αi antibody (αi3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or EE mAb, respectively. Varying amounts of membranes (P100 fraction) from cells expressing either αz-wild-type or αz-C3A, solubilized in sample buffer, were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted with the appropriate antibody. Bands were visualized by ECL, and signal intensity was quantitated as described above. Signal intensity per cell equivalent was calculated from samples in which signal intensity varied directly with amount of cell extract (that is, linear portions of the extract-intensity curve), and normalized by comparison with a standard curve of signal intensity derived from blots, with the same antibodies, of known amounts of αi2EE purified from Sf9 cells as described (23Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed on stably transfected CHO cell lines expressing the epitope-tagged α subunits αzEE, αzC3A-EE (palmitoylation-defective mutant) or αsHA. Quantitative Western analysis revealed cellular contents of αzEE and αzC3A-EE in the stable cell lines comparable to that of endogenous αi (∼ 2 × 106 molecules per cell; data not shown); cellular content of βγ was not significantly altered (data not shown). We have previously shown that the addition of the EE or HA epitope tags does not alter signaling or membrane attachment properties of these α subunits (21Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9667-9675Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we sought a different approach to gain insight into the potential role of myristate on targeting of newly synthesized αz. To do so, we compared the rate of membrane association of αz with that of a second α subunit, the α subunit (αs) of Gs, because αs is naturally subject only to palmitoylation but not myristoylation (4Jones T.L.Z. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L.Z. Simonds W.F. Weinstein L.S. G Proteins. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 49-65Google Scholar). Separation of [35S]methionine labeled cells expressing αzEE or αsHA into cytosolic S100 and particulate P100 fractions shows that newly synthesized αsHA associates much more slowly with membranes than does αzEE (Fig. 1). Following a 10-min pulse, 54% of αzEE was membrane-bound, compared with only 10% for αsHA (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that myristate allows an initial rapid association of αzEE with cellular membranes. In keeping with the idea that αzEE and αsHA are synthesized on soluble ribosomes, both proteins began in the cytosol fraction and moved to particulate fractions; as expected, both were found almost exclusively in the P100 fraction when chased for longer periods (Fig.1 B). To obtain a more detailed picture of the distribution of newly synthesized αz among the membranes of subcellular organelles, we fractionated metabolically labeled cells expressing αzEE on sucrose gradients and immunoprecipitated radiolabeled αzEE from each fraction. PM-enriched lighter membrane fractions separated well from heavier intracellular membranes. Fig. 2 shows that the PM is predominantly enriched in the later, light sucrose fractions (Fig. 2 C), whereas the earlier, denser fractions contain mainly endoplasmic reticulum and some Golgi membranes, but are relatively devoid of PM (Fig. 2, D and E). We used presence or absence of immunoreactivity to the PM marker, Na+/K+-ATPase, to distinguish fractions enriched, respectively, for PM or for intracellular membranes (IMs). After a 2.5 h chase, [35S]methionine-labeled αz shows the same distribution as the αzEE protein detected by Western analysis (Fig. 2, A andB) and cofractionates with the PM marker, Na+/K+-ATPase (Fig. 2 C). Thus, by 2.5 h following synthesis, αzEE has reached its steady-state distribution, in which it is predominantly located in the PM; this agrees with previous observations of steady-state, by indirect immunofluorescence, of α subunits expressed in cultured cells (6Morales J. Fishburn C.S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,24Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. von Zastrow M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Experiments using shorter chase periods showed that αzEE reached its steady-state distribution within 30 min following a 10-min pulse (see Fig. 6).Figure 6A palmitoylation-defective mutant of αz EE (αz C3A-EE) is less efficiently targeted to the PM than is wild-type α zEE. CHO cells stably expressing αzEE (wild-type (WT)) or αzC3A-EE (C3A) were pulse-labeled for 10 min with 350 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and then either harvested immediately (A) or after incubation in chase medium for 30 min (B), prior to fractionation and immunoprecipitation of α subunits. The amount of αzEE or αzC3A-EE in each fraction was determined as a percentage of the total membrane αzEE or αzC3A-EE, respectively. The percentages of αzEE and αzC3A-EE in the IM (black columns) and PM (white columns) were calculated by pooling the content of αzEE or αzC3A-EE in the fractions from the respective gradients, according to the presence (PM) or absence (IM) of Na+/K+-ATPase immunoreactivity. C,association of αzEE (white squares) and αzC3A-EE (black circles) with PM fractions with time. All values are means ± 2 S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether newly synthesized αz associates directly with the PM or whether it first associates with other intracellular membranes, we compared the subcellular distribution of αzEE at a short time after synthesis (10-min pulse, no chase) with that at steady-state (10-min pulse, 2.5-h chase). αzEE associated indiscriminately with cellular membranes shortly after synthesis and was present in both IM and PM fractions (Fig. 3). Following a 10-min pulse, 35% of membrane-bound αzEE was localized in intracellular membranes (Fig. 3, A and C). This proportion fell to 10% with time, as αzEE moved to the PM (Fig. 3, B and C) and then remained at this level with chase periods of up to 4 h (data not shown). The results of Fig. 3 suggest that immediately after synthesis αz associates with various intracellular membranes, and with time accumulates at the PM. To test whether αz travels to the PM through the exocytic pathway (hypothetically attached to the cytoplasmic face of trafficking vesicles), we treated αzEE-expressing cells with Brefeldin A (BFA), which disrupts endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi transport and prevents proteins that use the exocytic pathway from reaching the PM (25Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). As a control for the effect of BFA, we performed a parallel experiment on CHO cells stably expressing the μ-opioid receptor with a FLAG epitope tag at the N terminus. This receptor is an integral membrane protein, the transport of which to the PM should be inhibited by BFA. Fig. 4 shows that BFA failed to prevent αzEE from reaching the PM; that is, the distribution of αzEE is not affected by BFA (Fig. 4,A and B). In contrast, the newly synthesized μ opioid receptor remains in the early, heavy sucrose fractions following treatment with BFA (Fig. 4, C and D). BFA treatment caused the Golgi marker p58 to localize in the heavy sucrose fractions, and its distribution no longer overlapped partially with that of the PM marker Na+/K+-ATPase (data not shown). However, because BFA acts early in the secretory pathway, we cannot rule out the possibility that αz associates with membranes in the trans-Golgi network or the endosomes. These observations therefore confirm that (with or without BFA treatment) the αz in light sucrose fractions is located in membranes derived from the PM or organelles of the late secretory pathway, rather than in co-fractionating cis-Golgi membranes. Thus αzEE reached the PM efficiently despite disruption of the structure of the intracellular organelles by BFA, which was confirmed by immunocytochemistry on marker enzymes (data not shown). Thus passage of αzEE to the PM does not depend on vesicular transport or even on properly organized intracellular organelles. In the absence of vesicular transport, the most likely route for αz to reach the PM is that αzuses the limited membrane affinity of its myristoyl attachment to sample different membrane populations until the protein eventually is trapped specifically at the PM. Several studies have suggested that palmitate traps α subunits at the PM (6Morales J. Fishburn C.S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 26Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 647-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), where enzymatic palmitoylation of α subunits is proposed to take place (28Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). If palmitate acts to trap αz at the PM, then palmitoylated αz should be present only at the PM. To test this, we labeled cells expressing αzEE with [3H]palmitate and fractionated them on a sucrose gradient (Fig. 5). Palmitoylated αzEE was detected in PM-enriched fractions, co-fractionating precisely with Na+/K+-ATPase, and was not found in the heavier IM fractions. If, following synthesis, αz needs only to be palmitoylated to localize specifically at the PM, then the palmitoylation-defective mutant αzC3A should not be enriched at the PM, but should instead associate indiscriminately with membranes via its myristate anchor. Fractionation of αzC3A-EE-expressing cells following metabolic labeling shows that in the absence of palmitoylation, the mutant protein associates less efficiently and more slowly with the PM than does wild-type αz (Fig. 6). Shortly after synthesis (Fig. 6 A), only 52% of membrane-bound αzC3A-EE bound to PM, compared with 65% for wild-type αzEE (Fig. 3). After 30 min (Fig.6 B), 63% of the radiolabeled αzC3A-EE localized in PM-enriched fractions, compared with 90% for wild-type αzEE; this proportion remained constant for longer chase periods (data not shown). This agrees with our previous observations by immunofluores"

The active complex of NF-κB is composed of homodimers and heterodimers of p50, RelA, RelB, and c-Rel. These complexes are sequestered in the cytoplasm by IκBs. Extracellular signal-induced phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBs is essential for nuclear translocation of NF-κB. NF-κB binds to the recognition elements in the promoter region of target genes and activates transcription. Transactivation by NF-κB involves interaction with transcriptional coactivators such as CBP/p300 and SRC-1 and general transcription factors including TBP (5Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C.

In addition, NF-κB interacts with transcription factors such as activator protein 1 (AP-1) and serum response factors and synergistically activates transcription (9Stein B. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

IκBα is involved in transient activation of NF-κB because it is degraded rapidly upon stimulation and is resynthesized by activated NF-κB (1Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev.

Most of the inducers of NF-κB cause degradation of IκBα. The newly synthesized IκBα sequesters NF-κB in the cytoplasm and terminates the signal. IκBβ is involved in persistent activation of NF-κB (11Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Degradation of IκBβ is much more delayed than IκBα and resynthesis is independent of NF-κB (11Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Degradation of IκBβ is dependent on the cell type and the extracellular signals that induce NF-κB. For example, whereas interleukin 1 (IL-1) induces degradation of IκBβ in most cell types tested, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) induces degradation of IκBβ in E29.1 T cell hybridomas but not in Jurkat cells (11Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 12Weil R. Laurent-Winter C. Israel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9942-9949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Together, but not separately, TNF-α and interferon γ induce degradation of IκBβ in PC12 cells (13Chesire J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6746-6754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of IκBβ to repress NF-κB DNA binding is determined by the basal phosphorylation of the C-terminal PEST domain (14Chu Z.-L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Qi X. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5974-5984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The newly synthesized hypophosphorylated IκBβ functions as a chaperone for NF-κB by protecting it from IκBα (15Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The IκBβ·NF-κB complex enters the nucleus, binds to DNA, and activates transcription (16Phillips R.J. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4390-4396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tran K. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5386-5399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of the PEST domain by casein kinase II or the association of the IκBβ·NF-κB complex with high mobility group I (HMG I) proteins on selected promoters converts IκBβ to a repressor of NF-κB DNA binding activity (14Chu Z.-L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Qi X. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5974-5984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tran K. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5386-5399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two isoforms of IκBβ, β1 and β2, have been described recently (18Hirano F. Chung M. Tanaka H. Maruyama N. Makino I. Moore D. Scheidereit D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2596-2607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These isoforms differ in their C-terminal amino acids. IκBβ1 is functionally similar to IκBα and efficiently represses the activity of p50:RelA heterodimers. It is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and is degraded by various stimuli. In contrast, IκBβ2 is a cytoplasmic protein that is refractory to signal-induced degradation. Although both isoforms are indistinguishable in their binding preferences to cellular NF-κB/Rel homo- and heterodimers, IκBβ2 is more effective in inhibiting RelA homodimers than p50:RelA and p50:c-Rel heterodimers (18Hirano F. Chung M. Tanaka H. Maruyama N. Makino I. Moore D. Scheidereit D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2596-2607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This property of IκBβ2 is similar to that of IκBε which preferentially inhibits the activity of RelA homodimers (19Simeonidis S. Liang S. Chen G. Thanos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14372-14377Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence for the role of NF-κB in cancer progression and resistance to chemotherapy (20Gilmore T.D. Koedood M.

In this study, we have investigated the role of IκBα and IκBβ in constitutive activation of NF-κB in breast cancer cells. Constitutive DNA binding correlated with reduced levels of either IκBα or IκBβ. Both isoforms of IκBβ are present in breast cancer cell lines and primary breast cancers. Overexpressed IκBα but not IκBβ1 repressed constitutive DNA binding of NF-κB in MDA-MB-231 cells. IκBβ1, in contrast, repressed transactivation by NF-κB. Unlike in the mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line P19 and the human embryonic kidney cell line 293, mutants of IκBβ1 that cannot be phosphorylated by casein kinase II efficiently repressed transactivation by NF-κB in MDA-MB-231 cells (17Tran K.

The amount of radioactive DNA immunoprecipitated with the antibody complex was visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by densitometric scanning. Transient transfections and the CAT assay have been described previously (27Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Martin D.A. Goulet Jr., R.J. Sledge Jr., G.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3629-3639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using Statview software (version 4.1; Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Data were evaluated by one-factor analysis of variance and Fisher's protected least significant difference as a post hoc test. For serum stimulation, cells were maintained in MEM without serum for 48 h. MEM with 10% fetal calf serum was added, and the cells were harvested after 4 h. For EGF treatment, cells were maintained in MEM (without fetal calf serum) for 48 h. EGF (30 ng/ml) was added, and cells were harvested after 4 h. RNA was prepared by the guanidinium isothiocyanate/cesium chloride method and subjected to Northern blotting as described previously (30Bhat-Nakshatri P. Newton T. Goulet Jr., R. Nakshatri H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6971-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Constitutive NF-κB DNA binding activity in several breast cancer cell lines was compared with the expression level of IκBα and IκBβ (Fig. 1 and TableI). MCF-7, T47-D, and MDA-MB-157 cells displayed the least amount of NF-κB DNA binding and higher levels of IκBα and IκBβ compared with other cell lines (see “Experimental Procedures”). In comparison, NF-κB DNA binding activity in other cell lines were either high (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-468, and HBL-100) or intermediate (ZR-75–1, SK-BR-3, and Hs578T) (Fig. 1 A and Table I). Among these cell lines, MCF-7, T47-D, and ZR-75–1 express estrogen receptor α (ERα) and are more differentiated than other cell lines (37Sommers C.L. Byers S.W. Thompson E.W. Torri J.A. Gelmann E.P. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 31: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Most of the cell lines that displayed elevated NF-κB DNA binding activity are ERα-negative, consistent with our previous report (27Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Martin D.A. Goulet Jr., R.J. Sledge Jr., G.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3629-3639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to NF-κB, DNA binding of SP1 and CTF/NF-1 family transcription factors did not correlate with ERα status (Fig. 1 A). The NF-κB complex is a heterodimer of RelA and p50 subunits as determined by antibody supershift assays (data not shown). In general, NF-κB DNA binding activity correlated inversely with the levels of IκBα, IκBβ1, and IκBβ2 (Fig. 1 B, Table I). For example, higher NF-κB DNA binding correlated with reduced levels of either IκBα (MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-468), IκBβ2 (MDA-MB-436) or IκBα, or IκBβ1 and IκBβ2 (MDA-MB-231). IκBβ2 is the major IκBβ in breast cancer cell lines with the exception of HBL-100 and MDA-MB-436 cells which contained similar levels of IκBβ1 and IκBβ2. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm the presence of transcripts corresponding to IκBβ1 and IκBβ2 in breast cancer cells (data not shown). Proteins corresponding to IκBβ1 and IκBβ2 were also observed in primary breast cancers (data not shown). There was no correlation between IκB expression and NF-κB DNA binding activity in Hs578T and HBL-100 cells. Despite reduced levels of both IκBα and IκBβ2, NF-κB DNA binding was intermediate in Hs 578T. It is possible that this cell line overexpresses other IκB proteins. HBL-100 cells displayed elevated NF-κB DNA binding activity despite the presence of IκBα and IκBβ2. Whether elevated NF-κB DNA binding in this cell line is due to 1:1 ratio of IκBβ1 and IκBβ2 or due to reduced levels of other IκB proteins is not known. Constitutive NF-κB DNA binding activity did not correlate with elevated levels of RelA and p50 proteins (Fig. 1 B).Table ISummary of NF-κB DNA binding activity and IκB expression in breast cancer cell linesERαNF-κBIκBαIκBβ1IκBβ2MCF-7++++++++++T47-D+++++++++++ZR-75++++++++++MDA-MB-231−+++++++MDA-MB-435−++++++++++MDA-MB-157−+++++++++MDA-MB-436−+++++++++++MDA-MB-468−++++++++++++SK-BR-3−+++++++++++Hs578T−++++++HBL100−++++++++++++++ERα status in these cell lines has been described previously (30Bhat-Nakshatri P.

To determine the role of IκBα and IκBβ in constitutive NF-κB activation, we generated MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing IκBα and IκBβ1. The levels of IκBα and IκBβ1 in cells transduced with empty retrovirus (LxSN3), IκBα coding retrovirus (IκBα3–7), and IκBβ1 containing retrovirus (IκBβ21–25) were determined by Western blotting (Fig. 2 A). Two clones containing vector alone (called LxSN3 and LxSN5 cells hereafter), two clones with IκBα (IκBα5 and IκBα7 cells), and three clones with IκBβ1 (IκBβ21, IκBβ22, and IκBβ23) were chosen arbitrarily for this study. NF-κB DNA binding activity in these clones is shown in Fig. 2 B. IκBα overexpression resulted in reduced constitutive DNA binding (compare lane 1 and2 with lanes 3 and 4). Unexpectedly, constitutive NF-κB DNA binding was the same in IκBβ cells and LxSN cells (compare lanes 1 and 2 withlanes 5–7). Similar results were obtained when nuclear extracts instead of whole cell extracts were used (Fig. 2 B, lanes 8–14). Also, a similar binding pattern was obtained with PRDII element (NF-κB-binding site in the interferon-β gene promoter which is flanked by the HMG I protein-binding site) and the NF-κB-binding site of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) promoter (data not shown). The DNA·NF-κB complex is a heterodimer of p50 and RelA as antibodies against both proteins supershifted the complex (data not shown). IκBα or IκBβ overexpression did not affect DNA binding of AP-1 (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). As stated earlier, the hypophosphorylated IκBβ1 enters the nucleus and forms a stable complex with DNA-bound NF-κB. Inability of IκBβ1 to reduce NF-κB DNA binding activity could be due to unimpaired interaction of the IκBβ1·NF-κB complex with DNA. To address this possibility, we performed DNA immunoprecipitation assays with nuclear extracts from LxSN3, IκBα5, and IκBβ21 cells. Radiolabeled DNA·NF-κB complexes were immunoprecipitated with either RelA antibody, IκBα antibody, or IκBβ antibody. Antibody against neu oncogene was used as a negative control. DNA·NF-κB complex was efficiently immunoprecipitated by RelA antibody (Fig. 2C, lanes 1, 5, and 9). The amount of DNA·NF-κB complex immunoprecipitated by RelA antibody was similar to the amount of NF-κB·DNA complex identified in EMSA. Neither IκBα antibody nor neu antibody immunoprecipitated DNA·NF-κB complex from nuclear extracts (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12). IκBβ antibody immunoprecipitated radiolabeled probe from only IκBβ21 cells (compare lanes 3, 7, and 11). These results indicate that IκBβ1 either binds directly to the NF-κB-binding site or forms a stable complex with DNA-bound NF-κB. Whatever the mechanism involved, DNA binding of IκBβ1 did not interfere in DNA-NF-κB interaction. IκBβ1-DNA interaction was not observed in antibody supershift assays possibly due to the unstable nature of the complex under electrophoresis conditions (data not shown). To investigate the effect of IκBα and IκBβ on inducible DNA binding of NF-κB, we performed EMSA with extracts from cells treated with either TPA or IL-1β for 1 h. Inducible NF-κB DNA binding activity was lower in IκBα cells compared with other cells (Fig. 3 A). As with constitutive DNA binding, IκBβ failed to inhibit inducible NF-κB DNA binding. In fact, we consistently observed higher DNA binding in TPA-treated IκBβ cells compared with other cells (comparelanes 2, 5, 14, 17, and 20). IκBα and IκBβ overexpression did not affect DNA binding of AP-1 (Fig.3 A, lower panel). To determine whether IκBα and IκBβ overexpression alters the time course of NF-κB activation, EMSA was performed with the extracts from cells treated with TPA and IL-1 for specific intervals. TPA-inducible DNA binding activity was observed after 60 min of stimulation in all three cell types (Fig. 3 B, comparelanes 4, 13, and 22) and started to decline after 3 h of stimulation. We consistently observed increased NF-κB DNA binding activity in TPA-treated IκBβ cells compared with other cells. There was no cell type-specific variation in the rate of IκBα degradation. Approximately 50% of IκBα was present at 60 min and 2 h after TPA addition, and its level increased at 3 h (Fig. 3 B). NF-κB DNA binding activity at 6, 9, and 24 h after TPA addition was higher than in untreated cells which correlated with reduced levels of IκBα. Degradation of IκBβ1 was minimal (<25%) which was evident at 2 and 3 h post-stimulation. We next examined the time course of IL-1-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 3 C). NF-κB DNA binding increased within 30 min of IL-1 addition in all three cell types. There was a difference in the termination of inducible DNA binding. In LxSN5 and IκBα5 cells, maximum DNA binding was observed after 1 h of IL-1 addition and returned almost to basal levels by 2 h. In contrast, in IκBβ21 cells, a substantial level of inducible DNA binding persisted after 2 h of IL-1 addition. Similar results were obtained with three other IκBβ-overexpressing clones (data not shown). As with TPA-treated cells, IκBα degradation occurred at a similar rate in all three cell types, and partial degradation of IκBβ (<30%) coincided with induction of NF-κB DNA binding in IκBβ21 cells (data not shown). Taken together, our results demonstrate that although IκBα did inhibit constitutive DNA binding, neither IκBα nor IκBβ1 had much effect on inducible DNA binding of NF-κB in MDA-MB-231 cells. The inability of IκBβ1 to repress constitutive DNA binding of NF-κB was unexpected. However, it is possible that IκBβ1 may convert the NF-κB·DNA complex to a transcriptionally inactive complex similar to retinoblastoma protein-induced inactivation of the NF-κB·DNA complex (38Tamami M. Lindholm P.F. Brady J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24551-24556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To address this possibility, we performed transient transfection experiments using an NF-κB-dependent CAT reporter gene (NF-κB/CAT, see Ref. 27Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Martin D.A. Goulet Jr., R.J. Sledge Jr., G.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3629-3639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expectedly, constitutive and inducible activities of the NF-κB/CAT were lower in IκBα cells compared with LxSN cells (Fig.4 A). Interestingly, inducible activities of NF-κB/CAT, particularly with IL-1, were lower in IκBβ cells. The NF-κB/CAT reporter gene expression requires the binding site for NF-κB because a similar reporter in which the NF-κB-binding site has been mutated is inactive in MDA-MB-231 cells (27Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Martin D.A. Goulet Jr., R.J. Sledge Jr., G.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3629-3639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As stated in the Introduction, NF-κB interacts with AP-1, and this interaction results in synergistic activation of transcription. Because IκBβ1 inhibited NF-κB-dependent gene expression despite efficient DNA binding, it is possible that IκBβ1 in the NF-κB·DNA complex prevents synergistic interaction with AP-1 either due to a conformational change or steric hindrance. We measured constitutive and TPA-inducible activity of AP-1/CAT reporter gene in all cell lines. Similar levels of constitutive and TPA-inducible activity were observed in LxSN5, IκBα5, and IκBα7 cells (Fig.4 B). Due to differences in cell passage number, we consistently observed lower constitutive and TPA-inducible activities in LxSN3 cells. These cells were passed ∼15 more times than other clones. For unknown reasons, decreasing levels of AP-1 transcriptional activation with increasing cell passage were consistently observed with this cell line. The constitutive and TPA-inducible activities of AP-1 were reproducibly lower (n = 6) in IκBβ cells compared with other clones. Similar results were obtained with interleukin-11 (IL-11) promoter/CAT reporter with an AP-1-binding site (data not shown). The activity of the reporter gene is AP-1-dependent since an IL-11/CAT reporter in which the AP-1-binding site is mutated was inactive (data not shown). To confirm these results further, we performed transient transfection assays with AP-1/CAT reporter, RelA, and IκB expression vect"

Two 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, Rho and ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), are involved in the regulation of secretion and can activate PLD in vitro. We investigated in intact (human adenocarcinoma A549 cells) the role of RhoA and ARF in activation of PLD by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, bradykinin, and/or sphingosine 1-phosphate. To express recombinant Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme (using double subgenomic recombinant Sindbis virus C3), an ADP-ribosyltransferase that inactivates Rho, or dominant-negative Rho containing asparagine at position 19 (using double subgenomic recombinant Sindbis virus Rho19N), cells were infected with Sindbis virus, a novel vector that allows rapid, high level expression of heterologous proteins. Expression of C3 toxin or Rho19N increased basal and decreased phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated PLD activity. Bradykinin or sphingosine 1-phosphate increased PLD activity with additive effects that were abolished in cells expressing C3 exoenzyme or Rho19N. In cells expressing C3, modification of Rho appeared to be incomplete, suggesting the existence of pools that differed in their accessibility to the enzyme. Similar results were obtained with cells scrape-loaded in the presence of C3; however, results with virus infection were more reproducible. To assess the role of ARF, cells were incubated with brefeldin A (BFA), a fungal metabolite that disrupts Golgi structure and inhibits enzymes that catalyze ARF activation by accelerating guanine nucleotide exchange. BFA disrupted Golgi structure, but did not affect basal or agonist-stimulated PLD activity, i.e. it did not alter a rate-limiting step in PLD activation. It also had no effect on Rho-stimulated PLD activity, indicating that RhoA action did not involve a BFA-sensitive pathway. A novel PLD activation mechanism, not sensitive to BFA and involving RhoA, was identified in human airway epithelial cells by use of a viral infection technique that preserves cell responsiveness.

In intact cells, choline is rapidly phosphorylated to phosphocholine, which plays a role in cell proliferation (1Cuadrado A. Carnero A. Dolfi F. Jimenez B. Lacal L.C. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2959-2968PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatidic acid also serves as a second messenger in the regulation of secretion, DNA synthesis, and cell proliferation (2Fukami K. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10988-10994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLD activity appears to be regulated, and can be activated by both phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (3Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C.

Both native and recombinant PLD were activated by ∼20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins including ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) (3Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar), which are critical for vesicular trafficking (9Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and Rho, a GTPase that regulates several cellular functions including cytoskeletal organization (10Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). RhoA was required for guanosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate stimulation of PLD activity in neutrophil membranes (11Bowman E.P. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21509-21512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In rat fibroblasts, Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme, which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates RhoA (12Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibited activation of PLD by lysophosphatidic acid (13Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Similarly, toxin B from Clostridium difficile,which inactivates Rho family GTPases by monoglucosylation (14Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K.

More recently, it was demonstrated that activation of PLD via α2-adrenergic receptors in broken PC12 cell preparations required RhoA and PKC activation (17Jinsi-Parimoo A. Deth R.C. J. Biol.

Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6136-6140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Brefeldin A (BFA), a fungal metabolite that causes disruption of Golgi structure, can block ARF activation by inhibiting the guanine nucleotide-exchange protein that accelerates replacement of ARF-bound GDP by GTP (21Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 22Helms J.B. Rothman J.A.

A. 1996; 92: 12856-12860Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This causes dissociation of ARF and βCOP from Golgi membranes (in vivo and in vitro) before redistribution of Golgi components to the endoplasmic reticulum (24Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6409-6412Google Scholar). BFA inhibited carbachol stimulation of PLD activity in HEK cells expressing muscarinic M3 receptors (25Rumenapp U. Geiszt M. Wahn F. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but not PMA stimulation of PLD in HL-60 cells (26Guillemain I. Exton J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 812-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although BFA treatment has been used frequently to identify effects in cells that are ARF-dependent, the absence of BFA inhibition does not exclude a role for ARF, which can also be activated by BFA-insensitive guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins (27Meacci E. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition, BFA has actions that are apparently independent of ARF, such as stimulation of ADP-ribosylation (28De Matteis M.A. Di Girolamo M. Colanzi A. Pallas M. Di Tuillo G. McDonald L.J. Moss J. Santini G. Bannykh S. Corda D. Luini A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which further complicates the interpretation of effects observed in intact cells. Although there is evidence that the same PLD might be activated by ARF, Rho, and/or PKC (19Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), some forms of PLD are clearly not regulated by PKC or guanine nucleotide-binding proteins. Several studies do support a role for ARF and Rho in PLD activation (29Fensome A. Whatmore J. Morgan C. Jones D. Cockcroft S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13157-13164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For example, ARF and Rho acted synergistically in the activation of brain membrane PLD (7Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Jiang X. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Rho, ARF, and PKC were implicated in PLD activation in HL-60 (30Ohguchi K. Banno Y. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4366-4372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and brain cell membranes (7Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Jiang X. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar); clearly, the effects in disrupted and intact cells may be very different. To evaluate the role of Rho in intact cells, a novel Sindbis virus vector was used to induce expression of C3 and Rho proteins in A549 cells (human adenocarcinoma cells). From the observations reported here, it appears that a rate-limiting step in PLD stimulation by PMA, BK, and SPP in A549 cells involves RhoA but not a BFA-sensitive ARF pathway. Palmitic acid (9,10–3H) (30–60 Ci/mmol), used to label cellular phospholipids, was purchased from NEN Life Science Products, standard lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids, solvents were from Fluka, and silica gel 60 plates for thin layer chromatography were from Merck. PMA, BK, SPP, BFA, and other chemicals were from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against a synthetic peptide with RhoA sequence were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and monoclonal antibodies against Golgi 58-kDa protein were from Sigma. Rabbit antiserum raised against bacterially synthesized C3 was a generous gift of Dr. M. Popoff (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G1 conjugated with fluorescein and rhodamine-B, respectively) were from BIOSOURCE. Human lung carcinoma A549 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). All materials for cell culture were from Biofluid. A549 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (5 units/ml), streptomycin (5 μg/ml), and 2 mm glutamine. PLD activity was assayed by measuring [3H]phosphatidylethanol ([3H]PtdEtOH) produced via PLD-catalyzed transphosphatidylation in cells previously labeled with [3H]palmitic acid (31Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Engebrecht J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in medium containing bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml, for 24 h with [3H]palmitic acid (10 μCi/ml) added for the last 18 h. The medium was then aspirated and after washing, cells were incubated in fresh medium for 2 h. To initiate experiments, 1% ethanol was added 5 min before agonists. Incubations, at 37 °C, were terminated by washing monolayers twice with ice-cold PBS and immediately adding 1 ml of ice-cold methanol. Cells were collected by scraping and dishes were washed with an additional 1 ml of ice-cold methanol. Lipids were then extracted essentially as described by Bligh and Dyer (32Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41830) Google Scholar) except that water was replaced with 1 m NaCl. The lower phase was dried under a stream of nitrogen, and the residue was dissolved in a small volume of chloroform/methanol (2:1). [3H]PtdEtOH was separated from other phospholipids by TLC on silica gel 60 plates with the organic phase of the solvent mixture, chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (90:10:10, v/v/v), and unlabeled PtdEtOH as a marker. The appropriate lipid spots, detected by exposure to iodine vapor, were marked and scraped into scintillation vials, followed by 0.5 ml of methanol and liquid scintillation fluid before radioassay. Shuttle phagemids and dsSIN vectors were constructed as described by Hahnet al. (33Hahn C.S. Hahn Y.S. Braciale T.J. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2679-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and Huang (34Huang H.V. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Generation of dsSIN:C3, dsSIN:Rho19N, and dsSIN:CAT, which encode C3 exoenzyme, the negative dominant mutant of RhoA (Rho19N), and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (dsSIN:CAT), respectively, has been described (35Moorman J.P. Bobak D.A. Hahn C.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4146-4153PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bobak D. Moorman J. Guanzon A. Gutmer L. Hahn C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2179-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Viral stocks, 109 plaque-forming units/ml, were divided into portions sufficient for a single experiment and stored at −80 °C. Cells, plated at a density of 5–7 × 105 cells/plate and labeled when indicated with [3H]palmitic acid, were washed with PBS and diluted in PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 2 mmMgCl2. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h with the indicated amount of dsSIN recombinant, PBS was removed, appropriate culture medium was added, and infected cells were incubated for 2 h before addition of agonists and processing for PLD assay, Western analysis, or ADP-ribosylation experiments. A549 cells, grown to confluence on 100-mm Petri dishes, were washed twice with PBS and 2 ml of scraping buffer (114 mm KCl, 1 mm NaCl, 5.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl). C3 transferase (5 μg/ml) or vehicle was added in 0.5 ml of scraping buffer and the cells were gently scraped, suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal bovine serum, and split among six-well dishes. After 6–7 h of incubation, we estimated ∼70% viable cells. Cells were labeled with [3H]glycerol (5 μCi/ml) in serum-free medium overnight and used for PLD assay as described above. To evaluate protein expression from recombinant Sindbis virus, cultured cells were harvested at specified times after infection and lysed by sonification twice for 15 s on ice in Buffer A containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors (1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 μm aprotinin, and leupeptin and pepstatin, each 10 μg/ml). Total cellular protein was quantified, and samples (20–50 μg) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 16% gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were incubated overnight in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20 (TTBS (0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered (pH 7.6) saline)) and 0.2% I-block (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Hybridization with mouse monoclonal antibodies against RhoA or rabbit antiserum raised against bacterially synthesized C3 (2 h room temperature) was followed by washing with TTBS and incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After dsSIN infection, cells were harvested, washed, and lysed in Buffer A (106 cells/ml). Assays (total volume, 50 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 μm NAD, 0.5 μCi of [32P]NAD, 2 mm ADP-ribose, and lysate sample plus C3 exoenzyme or recombinant RhoA as a His6 (6× histidine, Calbiochem) fusion protein synthesized in Escherichia coli, as indicated, were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Proteins were precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; dried gels were exposed to autoradiography film. For indirect immunofluorescence experiments, A549 cells were grown on sterilized glass coverslips placed in six-well dishes with conditions as described for PLD assays. After incubation with BFA (5 μg/ml for 30 min) or infection with recombinant Sindbis virus (3 h earlier), cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in Dulbecco's PBS for 30 min at room temperature followed by further incubation sequentially for 2 min each with 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100% ethanol before permeabilization by a 30-min incubation with 0.05% saponin and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+. Cells were then incubated overnight with monoclonal antibodies against Golgi 58-K (a 58-kDa protein used as Golgi marker) or RhoA, or polyclonal antibodies against C3, washed four times, and incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse fluorescein- or rhodamine B-conjugated IgG. After washing in PBS containing 0.05% saponin and 1% bovine serum albumin, the coverslips were mounted on Mowoil (Hoescht), examined with a Leica confocal microscope equipped with appropriate filters, and scanned with the SCANware program. For IL-6 determination, confluent cells, treated or not with 5 μg/ml BFA for 30 min, were incubated for 2 h in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without or with 100 nm PMA. IL-6 in the medium was then quantified with an immunoassay kit (R & D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). Infection of A549 cells with dsSIN:C3 led to cell rounding, consistent with reported effects of microinjected C3 (37Paterson H.F. Self A.J. Garrett M.D. Just I. Aktories K. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Two hours after removal of virus, cell morphology had returned to normal (Fig.1). Intracellular C3 exoenzyme was detected as early as 2 h after infection with an MOI of 3 (Fig.2 A). Because expression was maximal with an MOI of 20, this condition was used for all other experiments. No reaction of anti-C3 antibodies with proteins in dsSIN:CAT-infected A549 cells was found, consistent with the specificity of these antibodies. The expression of C3 in A549 cells was accompanied by a loss of immunodetectable ∼20-kDa RhoA (Fig.2 B), probably because, as had been suggested for rat1 fibroblasts (13Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), ADP-ribosylation of RhoA increases its susceptibility to degradation. A significant level of immunoreactive Rho19N protein (a dominant negative mutant that contains asparagine at position 19), was detected by anti-RhoA antibodies 2 h after viral infection (MOI of 20). A faint band was observed in dsSIN:CAT-infected cells, indicating a low level of endogenous RhoA in A549 cells (Fig. 2 C). The involvement of Rho in PLD activation was demonstrated by infecting A549 cells with recombinant Sindbis virus vectors to express mutant Rho protein orC. botulinum C3 exoenzyme, an ADP-ribosyltransferase that inactivates Rho. Expression of either C3 exoenzyme or the dominant negative Rho19N in A549 cells by infection with dsSIN:C3 or dsSIN:Rho19N, respectively, resulted in a doubling of basal PLD activity (Table I). The increase was similar in A549 cells scrape-loaded in the presence of C3 transferase. The effect of C3 after scrape loading was less than that after Sindbis infection (∼50% stimulation versus ∼100%). Both experiments, however, suggest that Rho proteins play a role in the regulation of PLD activity in human epithelial cells and may have a negative effect on the enzyme activity, restraining or minimizing the level of PLD in unstimulated cells, perhaps by inhibiting a specific PLD or interfering with its activation.Table IEffect of Rho proteins on basal and C3-induced PLD activityTreatment of cellsPLD activityInfectedScrapedNo C3Plus C3% [3H]PtdEtOH/phosphatidylcholineNoNo0.20 ± 0.04dsSIN:CATNo0.22 ± 0.01dsSIN:Rho19NNo0.40 ± 0.03aExpression of C3 or Rho19N or C3 treatment significantly increased PLD activity (P < 0.05) by Student's t test.dsSIN:C3No0.43 ± 0.08aExpression of C3 or Rho19N or C3 treatment significantly increased PLD activity (P < 0.05) by Student's t test.NoYes0.31 ± 0.030.47 ± 0.05aExpression of C3 or Rho19N or C3 treatment significantly increased PLD activity (P < 0.05) by Student's t test.Serum-starved cells were incubated overnight with [3H]palmitic acid (10 μCi/ml) and infected with dsSIN:CAT or dsSIN:C3 as described under “Experimental Procedures” or scraped without or with C3 transferase (5 μg/ml) and labeled with [3H]glycerol (5 μCi/ml) in serum-free medium.

Open table in a new tab Serum-starved cells were incubated overnight with [3H]palmitic acid (10 μCi/ml) and infected with dsSIN:CAT or dsSIN:C3 as described under “Experimental Procedures” or scraped without or with C3 transferase (5 μg/ml) and labeled with [3H]glycerol (5 μCi/ml) in serum-free medium. Cells were processed for PLD assay as noted under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are means ± S.E. of values from three experiments with duplicate assays. PMA activation of PLD was appreciable at 15 min and reached a maximum after 30 min of stimulation (data not shown). With 1 μm PMA, PLD activity of A549 cells was increased 42 ± 4.1-fold after 30 min (Fig.3 A). The effect of 50 nm PMA was equal to that of 1 μm and 1 nm PMA: it increased activity 100% (data not shown). BK and SPP, which act through G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptors, also stimulated PLD activity (approximately 2-fold); maximal effects were achieved with 1 μm and 10 μm, respectively; these effects were additive (Fig. 3 B). As shown in Fig. 3 A, expression of either dsSIN:C3 or dsSIN:Rho19N reduced but did not abolish PMA stimulation of PLD activity, indicating that Rho proteins are involved in a PKC-dependent pathway. In cells infected with dsSIN:C3, BK or SPP failed to increase PLD activity (Fig. 3 B). BK plus SPP, however, induced an ∼80% increase in PLD activity, suggesting that the combination of agonists was able to overcome, in part, the inhibitory effects of C3, perhaps acting through Rho that had not been ADP-ribosylated by the exoenzyme. In scrape-loaded cells, the effect of C3 in reducing PLD stimulation by agonists was less than it was in infected cells, albeit statistically significant; in cells expressing C3, PMA stimulation was reduced 25 ± 2% versus38 ± 4% (n = 3), and BK plus SPP stimulation was reduced 20 ± 1.5% versus 40 ± 9% (n = 3). These data are consistent with the conclusion that for demonstration of C3 effects, viral infection was more effective than scrape loading. To explore the possibility that the incomplete reduction of PLD stimulation by C3 was due to differences in the accessibility of intracellular pools of Rho, we quantified ADP-ribosylation of RhoA in cell lysates. First to prove that C3 transferase expressed in dsSIN:C3 infected cells was enzymatically active, 100 ng of exogenous RhoA (His6-Rho) and [14C]NAD were added to cell lysates (Fig.4). A clear band of 20 kDa was detected, indicating that the C3 transferase was able to catalyze ADP-ribosylation of RhoA. Then to verify whether the intracellular pools of Rho were completely modified by the expressed C3 transferase, we performed experiments using exogenous C3 exoenzyme. ADP-ribosylation of endogenous Rho was not detected when C3 exoenzyme was added at final concentration of 0.025 μg/ml to lysates of cells infected with dsSIN:CAT or dsSIN:C3. After addition of higher concentration of C3 (0.5 μg/ml) (Fig. 5), a single radiolabeled band, corresponding in migration to endogenous Rho, was detected. The band at ∼20 kDa was more intense in lane 4than in lane 2, consistent with the larger amount of the overexpressed dominant negative Rho19N. The presence of a band inlane 6, although perhaps somewhat weaker than that inlane 2, suggested that even when the expression of C3 seemed maximal, modification of the endogenous Rho was not complete. Similarly, some endogenous Rho was inaccessible to the C3 in dsSIN:C3-infected cells that were treated with agonists (Fig.6). Those data could explain the incomplete inhibition of PMA stimulation of PLD and the significant, albeit attenuated, effects of BK and SPP on PLD activity in cells expressing C3 exoenzyme. The extent of ADP-ribosylation of endogenous Rho in dsSIN:C3-infected cells varied from one experiment to another, but it was always statistically significant when data were quantified by densitometry (data not shown). Because of the presence of unmodified RhoA, indirect immunofluorescence was used to localize C3 exoenzyme and RhoA in A549 cells. In dsSIN:C3-infected cells, C3 transferase was concentrated in the Golgi compartment and widely distributed in the cytosol (Fig. 7, panel 4). Endogenous RhoA in unstimulated cells appeared predominantly in Golgi and in endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 7, panels 5 and6). Thus, indirect immunofluorescence indicated colocalization of C3 and endogenous RhoA in Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum compartments.Figure 5ADP-ribosylation of endogenous Rho in A549 cells. Samples (20 μg) of lysates from cells infected with dsSIN:CAT, dsSIN:Rho19N, or dsSIN:C3 were incubated with [32P]NAD with or without C3 exoenzyme (0.5 μg) and processed as described in Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)F"

Nonactivated, membrane-associated PDE (PDE-M, αβγ2) has one exchangeable site for cGMP binding; endogenous cGMP remains nonexchangeable at the second site.

The properties of nonactivated PDE can be restored upon addition of γ subunit.

Photoactivation of the visual pigment rhodopsin leads to G-protein (transducin) activation, which then proceeds to the activation of PDE. The activated α subunit of transducin (αt-GTP) is believed to activate the membrane-associated rod PDE holoenzyme (subunit stoichiometry, αβγ2) by displacing the inhibitory γ subunits (Pγ) from the active sites of the catalytic heterodimer (Pαβ). The enhanced hydrolytic activity of the activated PDE rapidly reduces cytoplasmic cGMP levels and then leads to dissociation of bound cGMP from the cGMP-gated ion channel, closure of the ion channel, and finally a hyperpolarization of the membrane. These steps constitute the excitation pathway for vertebrate visual transduction (for reviews see Refs. 1Pugh Jr., E.N. Lamb T.D. Biochim. Biophys.

The PDE in rods and cones (classified as PDE6 (4Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar)) is most closely related to the cGMP-specific PDE (PDE5) based on several criteria, including overall amino acid sequence similarity, substrate preference for cGMP over cAMP, inhibition of catalysis by isozyme-selective drugs, and the presence of a consensus sequence in the N-terminal half of the protein that represents noncatalytic cGMP binding domains. In the case of PDE5, binding of cGMP to the noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites may regulate activity indirectly via protein phosphorylation of the enzyme (reviewed in Ref. 5Burns F. Zhao A.Z. Beavo J.A. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 29-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cGMP-stimulated PDE (PDE2) also contains noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites that allosterically regulate catalysis at the active site (6Martins T.J. Mumby M.C. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1973-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).For the photoreceptor PDE, most of our current knowledge about the role of the noncatalytic sites in PDE regulation has been obtained with amphibian rod PDE. It has been found that cGMP occupancy at the noncatalytic binding sites of frog photoreceptor PDE enhances the association of Pγ with Pαβ in a reciprocal manner, and it has been postulated that cGMP binding at the noncatalytic binding sites may determine whether the Pγ subunit can participate as an accessory GTPase-activating protein for accelerating transducin inactivation (7Yamazaki A.

In addition, the noncatalytic sites on frog rod PDE have been postulated to serve as a cytoplasmic buffer for cGMP, possibly serving to help restore cGMP levels during recovery from the light stimulation (11Cote R.H.

Two distinct isoforms of rod PDE have been described in bovine rod photoreceptors, a membrane-associated PDE (PDE-M) and a soluble PDE (PDE-S) (13Baehr W. Devlin M.J. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11669-11677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gillespie P.G. Prusti R.K. Apel E.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12187-12193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The only known difference between the two isoforms is the presence of a 17-kDa δ subunit (Pδ) associated with PDE-S but not PDE-M (14Gillespie P.G. Prusti R.K. Apel E.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12187-12193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Pδ subunit can solubilize membrane-associated PDE in vitro (15Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24036-24047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but its role in visual transduction has not been determined. The noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites on bovine PDE-M have been shown to bind and release cGMP very slowly (16Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and little is known about the cGMP binding properties of PDE-S. Thus, it remains unclear whether the noncatalytic sites on mammalian rod PDE play a similar physiological role to what has been proposed for the amphibian system.In this paper, we first show that PDE-M and PDE-S in their nonactivated states have different cGMP binding properties. Both high affinity cGMP sites on PDE-S are slowly exchangeable, whereas PDE-M contains one exchangeable and one nonexchangeable noncatalytic site. The presence of the Pδ subunit in PDE-S suggests a role for this subunit in enhancing cGMP exchange at one noncatalytic site that is nonexchangeable in PDE-M. Second, activation of the two isoforms leads to similar behavior of PDE-S and PDE-M in terms of the following: 1) a large decrease in cGMP binding affinity at one noncatalytic site; 2) a ∼10-fold acceleration of cGMP exchange at the remaining high affinity site; and 3) similar hydrolytic rates at the active site. Although it is unlikely that cGMP binding and release at the noncatalytic sites regulate PDE activity during the early events of visual excitation, changes in cGMP occupancy at the noncatalytic sites may help regulate the lifetime of activated PDE during later stages of the visual transduction pathway.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that mammalian rod photoreceptor PDE isoforms can undergo substantial changes in cGMP binding to two non-identical, high affinity noncatalytic sites upon activation of the enzyme by removal of the Pγ subunits. We also report that the soluble and membrane-associated isoforms of bovine rod PDE have different binding properties in their nonactivated states. Finally, our results demonstrate that the Pγ subunit is primarily responsible for altering cGMP exchange upon activation and that the Pδ subunit may interact with Pγ binding to the enzyme to permit cGMP exchange at a site on non-activated PDE that is nonexchangeable in PDE-M but exchangeable in PDE-S.The Two High Affinity Noncatalytic Binding Sites on Bovine Rod PDE Are Not IdenticalPrevious work established that the PDE-M holoenzyme contains 2 high affinity cGMP-binding sites that retain bound cGMP even following extensive purification (16Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We have extended that work to demonstrate that the soluble isoform of rod PDE also contains 2 high affinity cGMP-binding sites. Of greater significance is the demonstration that the two noncatalytic sites are not identical in their cGMP binding properties. The presence of one functionally nonexchangeable cGMP-binding site on nonactivated PDE-M is in marked contrast to the two exchangeable sites found in bovine rod PDE-S (Fig.2), cone PDE (17Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8133-8141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or the amphibian membrane-associated rod PDE (10Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Activation of bovine rod PDE reveals a fundamental difference between the two non-identical noncatalytic sites on both bovine rod isoforms. Removal of the Pγ subunits from PDE-M or PDE-S eliminates detectable binding (K D >1 μm) of cGMP to one of the two classes of noncatalytic sites on the Pαβ dimer. This effect represents a shift of ≥100-fold in overall cGMP binding affinity at this site and a rate of dissociation that is too fast to detect by filter binding (t12<4 s). The remaining cGMP-binding sites exhibit a 3-fold reduction in overall binding affinity upon removal of Pγ compared with the [3H]cGMP-binding sites on nPDE-M or nPDE-S. We conclude that the Pγ subunit not only acts in its well known role as an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide catalysis at the active sites on Pαβ but also serves to regulate the affinity of interaction of cGMP with the two distinct noncatalytic sites on the Pαβ dimer. The amphibian PDE, in contrast, shows no detectable cGMP binding to Pαβ when the Pγ subunits are removed by limited proteolysis (7Yamazaki A. Sen I. Bitensky M.W. Casnellie J.E. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11619-11624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Yamazaki A. Bartucci F. Ting A. Bitensky M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3702-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or by extraction with activated transducin (10Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).No Intrinsic Differences in the Catalytic Pαβ Dimers Derived from PDE-S and PDE-MBased on the results of this study and previous work (14Gillespie P.G. Prusti R.K. Apel E.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12187-12193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24036-24047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), it appears very likely that the catalytic subunits are identical in PDE-S and PDE-M. The molecular weights of α and β are indistinguishable on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (14Gillespie P.G. Prusti R.K. Apel E.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12187-12193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the catalytic constant of tPDE-S is identical to that of tPDE-M (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 14Gillespie P.G. Prusti R.K. Apel E.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12187-12193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites show very similar kinetic and equilibrium binding behavior for the purified Pαβ dimers derived from PDE-S and PDE-M (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6 and Table I). Whereas a definitive statement awaits direct amino acid sequence comparisons of the α and β subunits of PDE-S and PDE-M, all available evidence indicates that binding of the Pδ subunit to the PDE holoenzyme confers the differences in behavior seen with nPDE-S and nPDE-M.Two Distinct Actions of Pδ on PDEWe report a new function that can be ascribed to the binding of the Pδ subunit to rod PDE; the ability of Pδ to permit cGMP release from a second noncatalytic binding site on nPDE-S that remains functionally nonexchangeable in PDE-M. How this effect of Pδ on PDE-S relates to the other known function of Pδ (namely to solubilize PDE that would otherwise remain attached to rod outer segment disk membranes (15Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24036-24047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)) is not clear at present. However, membrane association of PDE is not required for Pδ binding, since purified nPDE-M to which recombinant Pδ has been added is able to exchange endogenous cGMP at both noncatalytic sites in the absence of membrane attachment.Physiological Significance of Noncatalytic cGMP-binding Sites on Mammalian Rod PDE IsoformsIn the dark-adapted photoreceptor, cytoplasmic cGMP levels are in the low micromolar range, and both noncatalytic sites on nPDE-S and nPDE-M will be fully occupied. The mechanism by which transducin activates PDE to lower rapidly cytoplasmic cGMP levels during visual excitation is well understood and quantitatively accounts for the rising phase of the photoresponse (for review see Ref. 1Pugh Jr., E.N. Lamb T.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 111-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Thus, there is no need to invoke the noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites on bovine rod PDE to describe the regulation of PDE during the initial events of photo-excitation. We consider instead possible ways the noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites may be involved in later stages of the visual transduction pathway, namely recovery from light stimulation and/or light adaptation.A role for the noncatalytic sites to buffer free cGMP levels during the recovery phase of the flash photoresponse has been proposed for amphibian rod photoreceptors (12Yamazaki A. Bondarenko V.A. Dua S. Yamazaki M. Usukura J. Hayashi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32495-32498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this model, the noncatalytic sites serve to buffer cytoplasmic cGMP levels in the dark, and upon PDE activation release bound cGMP to accelerate the return to the resting state. Our data show that activation of mammalian rod PDE by removing the Pγ subunit results in the immediate loss of detectable binding to one of the noncatalytic sites on both PDE-M and PDE-S. This rapidly dissociating class of sites has the potential to release its bound cGMP on the same time scale as recovery phase of the photoresponse (<1 s in mammalian photoreceptors (31Baylor D.A. Nunn B.J. Schnapf J.L. J. Physiol. 1984; 357: 575-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 32Lyubarsky A.L. Pugh Jr., E.N. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 563-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). However, upon cGMP release from the bound state, it is likely that the free cGMP would be destroyed by the still-active catalytic sites and therefore not contribute to elevating the cytoplasmic cGMP levels during photoresponse recovery. This conclusion is supported by recent measurements of cGMP dissociation and hydrolysis in amphibian rod outer segment suspensions (33Calvert P.D. Ho T.W. LeFebvre Y.M. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).An alternative hypothesis is that the noncatalytic sites on PDE may indirectly regulate the lifetime of transducin-activated PDE via modulation of Pγ binding affinity to Pαβ (10Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This idea is based on the following observations in amphibian and mammalian photoreceptors: removal of bound cGMP from the noncatalytic sites in frog ROS reduces Pγ binding affinity to Pαβ (9Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24501-24507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and correlates with an accelerated transducin GTPase activity (34Arshavsky V.Y. Bownds M.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar); in bovine ROS, Pγ serves as a GTPase accelerating factor (35Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16290-16296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Zhu Y. Artemyev N.O. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19882-19887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) acting in concert with the RGS9 protein (37He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 38Tsang S.H. Burns M.E. Calvert P.D. Gouras P. Baylor D.A. Goff S.P. Arshavsky V.Y. Science. 1998; 282: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Accordingly, cGMP dissociation from the rapidly dissociating class of sites on activated PDE might signal Pγ to interact with RGS9 to stimulate GTPase activity of transducin to inactivate PDE during the recovery phase of the photoresponse.cGMP dissociation from the second high affinity class of binding sites on bovine rod PDE is too slow (t12∼1.6min; Table I) to be implicated in the recovery process of the dark-adapted photoresponse. It is possible that cGMP dissociation from these noncatalytic sites may act to reduce gradually the lifetime of activated PDE during adaptation to continuous illumination and thereby lead to the smaller, faster responses characteristic of the light-adapted state. Coles and Yamane (39Coles J.A. Yamane S. J. Physiol. 1975; 247: 180-207Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and Cervetto et al. (40Cervetto L. Torre V. Pasino E. Marroni P. Capovilla M. Borsellino A. Cervetto L. Photoreceptors. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1984: 159-175Crossref Google Scholar) have shown a gradual acceleration of recovery of the flash photoresponse when amphibian rod photoreceptors are exposed to continuous illumination; this response acceleration slowly develops over the same general time frame as cGMP dissociation from the higher affinity noncatalytic sites on PDE. Future work is needed to establish whether a strict temporal correlation exists between occupancy of cGMP at the noncatalytic sites and the kinetics of the recovery phase of the light-adapted photoresponse, and whether these studies performed with lower vertebrates are relevant to the regulation of mammalian rod phototransduction.In conclusion, cGMP binding and dissociation at the noncatalytic sites on the photoreceptor PDE may indirectly regulate the enzyme by affecting the strength of the interaction of the Pγ subunit with the catalytic subunits. This in turn may direct whether Pγ interacts with the Pαβ dimer to regulate catalytic activity or with transducin and its GTPase-accelerating protein, RGS9, to regulate the kinetics of transducin inactivation. In addition, there is conflicting evidence at present (9Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24501-24507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Granovsky A.E. Natochin M. McEntaffer R.L. Haik T.L. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24485-24490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as to whether the noncatalytic sites can allosterically regulate hydrolytic activity at the active sites, as has been demonstrated for PDE2 (6Martins T.J. Mumby M.C. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1973-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results in this paper provide a strong foundation for unraveling the complex interplay between the noncatalytic and catalytic sites on photoreceptor PDE and the low molecular weight Pγ and Pδ subunits that interact with and regulate the action of this central effector enzyme in visual transduction. The cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) 1The abbreviations used are: PDE, photoreceptor phosphodiesterase; PDE-M, membrane-associated bovine rod PDE; PDE-S, soluble bovine rod PDE; nPDE, non-activated PDE; tPDE, trypsinized PDE; Pαβ, catalytic dimer of PDE; Pγ, inhibitory 10 kDa γ subunit of PDE; Pδ, 17-kDa δ subunit associated with PDE-S; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: PDE, photoreceptor phosphodiesterase; PDE-M, membrane-associated bovine rod PDE; PDE-S, soluble bovine rod PDE; nPDE, non-activated PDE; tPDE, trypsinized PDE; Pαβ, catalytic dimer of PDE; Pγ, inhibitory 10 kDa γ subunit of PDE; Pδ, 17-kDa δ subunit associated with PDE-S; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. present in rod and cone retinal photoreceptors is the central effector enzyme for vertebrate visual excitation. Photoactivation of the visual pigment rhodopsin leads to G-protein (transducin) activation, which then proceeds to the activation of PDE. The activated α subunit of transducin (αt-GTP) is believed to activate the membrane-associated rod PDE holoenzyme (subunit stoichiometry, αβγ2) by displacing the inhibitory γ subunits (Pγ) from the active sites of the catalytic heterodimer (Pαβ). The enhanced hydrolytic activity of the activated PDE rapidly reduces cytoplasmic cGMP levels and then leads to dissociation of bound cGMP from the cGMP-gated ion channel, closure of the ion channel, and finally a hyperpolarization of the membrane. These steps constitute the excitation pathway for vertebrate visual transduction (for reviews see Refs. 1Pugh Jr., E.N. Lamb T.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 111-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 2Helmreich E.J.M. Hofmann K.P. Biochim. Biophys.

The photoreceptor PDE is a member of a family of phosphodiesterases that all share the ability to hydrolyze cyclic nucleotides. The PDE in rods and cones (classified as PDE6 (4Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar)) is most closely related to the cGMP-specific PDE (PDE5) based on several criteria, including overall amino acid sequence similarity, substrate preference for cGMP over cAMP, inhibition of catalysis by isozyme-selective drugs, and the presence of a consensus sequence in the N-terminal half of the protein that represents noncatalytic cGMP binding domains. In the case of PDE5, binding of cGMP to the noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites may regulate activity indirectly via protein phosphorylation of the enzyme (reviewed in Ref. 5Burns F. Zhao A.Z. Beavo J.A. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 29-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cGMP-stimulated PDE (PDE2) also contains noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites that allosterically regulate catalysis at the active site (6Martins T.J. Mumby M.C. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1973-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the photoreceptor PDE, most of our current knowledge about the role of the noncatalytic sites in PDE regulation has been obtained with amphibian rod PDE. It has been found that cGMP occupancy at the noncatalytic binding sites of frog photoreceptor PDE enhances the association of Pγ with Pαβ in a reciprocal manner, and it has been postulated that cGMP binding at the noncatalytic binding sites may determine whether the Pγ subunit can participate as an accessory GTPase-activating protein for accelerating transducin inactivation (7Yamazaki A.

A. 1994; 91: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, the noncatalytic sites on frog rod PDE have been postulated to serve as a cytoplasmic buffer for cGMP, possibly serving to help restore cGMP levels during recovery from the light stimulation (11Cote R.H. Brunnock M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17190-17198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yamazaki A. Bondarenko V.A. Dua S. Yamazaki M. Usukura J. Hayashi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32495-32498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Much less is known about the function of noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites on photoreceptor PDE during visual transduction in mammalian rod photoreceptors. Two distinct isoforms of rod PDE have been described in bovine rod photoreceptors, a membrane-associated PDE (PDE-M) and a soluble PDE (PDE-S) (13Baehr W. Devlin M.J. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11669-11677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gillespie P.G. Prusti R.K. Apel E.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12187-12193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The only known difference between the two isoforms is the presence of a 17-kDa δ subunit (Pδ) associated with PDE-S but not PDE-M (14Gillespie P.G. Prusti R.K. Apel E.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12187-12193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Pδ subunit can solubilize membrane-associated PDE in vitro (15Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24036-24047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but its role in visual transduction has not been determined. The noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites on bovine PDE-M have been shown to bind and release cGMP very slowly (16Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and little is known about the cGMP binding properties of PDE-S. Thus, it remains unclear whether the noncatalytic sites on mammalian rod PDE play a similar physiological role to what has been proposed for the amphibian system. In this paper, we first show that PDE-M and PDE-S in their nonactivated states have different cGMP binding properties. Both high affinity cGMP sites on PDE-S are slowly exchangeable, whereas PDE-M contains one exchangeable and one nonexchangeable noncatalytic site. The presence of the Pδ subunit in PDE-S suggests a role for this subunit in enhancing cGMP exchange at one noncatalytic site that is nonexchangeable in PDE-M. Second, activation of the two isoforms leads to similar behavior of PDE-S and PDE-M in terms of the following: 1) a large decrease in cGMP binding affinity at one noncatalytic site; 2) a ∼10-fold acceleration of cGMP exchange at the remaining high affinity site; and 3) similar hydrolytic rates at the active site. Although it is unlikely that cGMP binding and release at the noncatalytic sites regulate PDE activity during the early events of visual excitation, changes in cGMP occupancy at the noncatalytic sites may help regulate the lifetime of activated PDE during later stages of the visual transduction pathway. DISCUSSIONWe have shown that mammalian rod photoreceptor PDE isoforms can undergo substantial changes in cGMP binding to two non-identical, high affinity noncatalytic sites upon activation of the enzyme by removal of the Pγ subunits. We also report that the soluble and membrane-associated isoforms of bovine rod PDE have different binding properties in their nonactivated states. Finally, our results demonstrate tha"

The vitamin pantothenate is essential for the synthesis of coenzyme A, a universal carrier of activated acyl groups. Many organisms, such as most bacteria and higher plants, synthesize pantothenate de novo. Mammals (including man) or the bakers' yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, however, have lost this ability and depend on the supply of pantothenate with their diet or growth medium. The pantothenate dependence of bakers' yeast was first reported in 1942 (1Leonian L.H. Lilly V.G. Am. J. Bot. 1942; 29: 459-464Crossref Google Scholar), when the effects of different vitamins, such as pyridoxine (vitamin B6), thiamine (vitamin B1), biotin (vitamin H), and pantothenate, on the growth ofS. cerevisiae were analyzed. Whereas all strains analyzed grew equally well in the absence of pyridoxine or thiamine, growth was drastically retarded when biotin or pantothenate was omitted from the growth medium. This suggested that biotin and pantothenate cannot by synthesized by S. cerevisiae and that both vitamins have to be taken up from the medium by plasma membrane-localized vitamin transporters. Only recently has the VHT1 gene encoding the H+-biotin symporter of the S. cerevisiae plasma membrane been identified (2Stolz J. Hoja U. Meier S. Sauer N. Schweizer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18741-18746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This transporter belongs to the major facilitator superfamily (3Marger M.D. Saier Jr., M.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) and is part of a subfamily of eightS. cerevisiae genes encoding proteins sharing between 20 and 30% amino acid identity. This subfamily was named the allantoate transporter family (4Nelissen B. De Wachter R. Goffeau A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 113-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) after the product of the DAL5 gene, which was the first member of this family that has been assigned a specific transporter function (5Rai R. Genbauffe F.S. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 266-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dal5p transports allantoate and ureidosuccinate across the yeast plasma membrane, two compounds that can be used as sole nitrogen sources. The physiological functions of the remaining six putative transporters of this family are not known, although mutations in two of these open reading frames confer resistances against ethionine sulfoxide (6Isnard A.-D. Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and the antifungal substance fenpropimorph (7Marcireau C. Joets J. Pousset D. Guilloton M. Karst F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The responsible genes were named SEO1 (for suppressor ofethionine sulfoxide resistance 1) and FEN2 (for fenpropimorph resistance2) and correspond to the open reading framesYCR028C and YAL067C, respectively. Fungal resistance to the fungicide fenpropimorph has been the object of intensive studies by several laboratories (e.g. Refs.8Lorenz R.T. Parks L.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1991; 35: 1532-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Kelly D.E. Rose M.E. Kelly S.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 122: 223-226PubMed Google Scholar, 10Engels A.J.G.

Pharmacol. 1998; 50: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), and the common result of these studies was that fenpropimorph impairs sterol biosynthesis by inhibition of sterol Δ8,7-isomerase and C14 sterol reductase. Treatment of S. cerevisiae wild-type cells with fenpropimorph results in a drastic reduction of the ergosterol content, the major sterol of yeast cells, and in growth inhibition. This could be overcome with bulk levels of exogenous unsaturated C5,6sterols (8Lorenz R.T. Parks L.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1991; 35: 1532-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). When the open reading frame YCR028C was first characterized (12Agostini Carbone M.L. Panzeri L. Muzi Falcone M. Carcano C. Plevani P. Lucchini G. Yeast. 1992; 8: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), it was found that disruption of YCR028C caused sensitivity to 3-aminotriazole, an inhibitor of histidine biosynthesis. The FEN2 gene of S. cerevisiae was shown to be allelic to open reading frame YCR028C after its identification by complementation cloning in thefen2-1 mutant strain CM2 (7Marcireau C. Joets J. Pousset D. Guilloton M. Karst F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thefen2-1 mutation caused a 3-fold decrease in the ergosterol content and reduced growth on complete medium (7Marcireau C. Joets J. Pousset D. Guilloton M. Karst F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, no intermediates of ergosterol biosynthesis accumulated in CM2, suggesting that none of the biosynthetic steps between squalene and ergosterol was impaired. Therefore, the specific activities of all enzymes involved in squalene biosynthesis were analyzed in vitro, but again no impaired step was identified. Surprisingly, the specific activity of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase was increased in CM2 (7Marcireau C. Joets J. Pousset D. Guilloton M. Karst F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It was also observed (7Marcireau C. Joets J. Pousset D. Guilloton M. Karst F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) that on minimal medium, the CM2 mutant strain was phenotypically indistinguishable from the wild-type strains. Fenpropimorph resistance, reduced ergosterol content, and growth retardation of CM2 were seen only on complete medium. After further analyses of this effect on different growth media, it was finally concluded that the mutant phenotype is observed only in the presence of a fermentative carbon source and under conditions of nitrogen catabolite repression, such as an excess of ammonium ions or amino acids in the growth medium (7Marcireau C. Joets J. Pousset D. Guilloton M. Karst F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It was therefore suggested that theFEN2 gene product is involved in the coregulation of carbon catabolite repression, nitrogen catabolite repression, and the general control of amino acid and ergosterol biosynthesis (7Marcireau C. Joets J. Pousset D. Guilloton M. Karst F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that the S. cerevisiae FEN2 gene encodes a plasma membrane-localized, high affinity H+-pantothenate symporter. We also present experiments explaining the different phenotypic properties of fen2mutant strains on minimal and complete media and discuss the potential mechanism of fen2-derived fenpropimorph resistance. For characterization of the FEN2 gene, we used yeast strain 711/1a (Mat a, ura3-52,trp1Δ1) and its isogenic fen2 disruptant 711/1c (Matα, ura3-52, trp1Δ1, fen2::URA3). The FEN2-overexpressing strain was derived from strain 711/1c by transformation with the plasmid pFEN2mc. This plasmid was generated by cloning the HindIII insert of plasmid pLA514 (12Agostini Carbone M.L. Panzeri L. Muzi Falcone M. Carcano C. Plevani P. Lucchini G. Yeast. 1992; 8: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) that was shown to complement thefen2 mutation (7Marcireau C. Joets J. Pousset D. Guilloton M. Karst F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) into the HindIII site of the plasmid YEplac112 (13Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2510) Google Scholar). For analysis of β-alanine transport, we used strain Σ1278b (Matα, wild type) (14Béchet J. Grenson M. Wiame J.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), strain 2512c (Matα, gap1-1) (15Grenson M. Hou C. Crabeel M. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 103: 770-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and strain 22574d (Matα, gap1-1,put4-1, uga4-1,ura3-1) (16Jauniaux J.-C. Vandenbol M. Visser S. Broman K. Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Standard minimal medium contained yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco, Augsburg, Germany) and 2% d-glucose. The pantothenate concentration of this medium was 0.84 μm. For other pantothenate concentrations, the medium was made from analytical grade chemicals according to the formula of Difco for yeast nitrogen base without amino acids plus 2% d-glucose, but omitting pantothenate; dissolved at 10 times the final concentration; filter-sterilized; and stored at 4 °C. Pantothenate or β-alanine was added to this medium from filter-sterilized stocks (100 mm) to give the desired final concentrations. Yeast transformation was carried out as described (17Gietz D. Jean A.S. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase (A600 nm ∼ 1.0 in minimal medium and ∼ 3.0 in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2%d-glucose)), harvested by centrifugation, and washed once with ice-cold water. After washing in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, the cells were resuspended in this buffer to give 10 A units/ml and incubated in a rotatory shaker at 30 °C. Cells were energized with glucose (1% final concentration), and the assay was started by the addition of 14C-labeled pantothenate (1.7 μm initial concentration; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO), β-[14C]alanine (2.1 μm initial concentration; Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany), l-[14C]lysine (100 μminitial concentration; NEN Life Science Products, Köln, Germany), or [14C]biotin (10.7 μm initial concentration; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, Germany). Uptake of d-[14C]glucose (100 μm initial concentration; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was determined without the addition of unlabeled glucose. At timed intervals, cells were filtered on nitrocellulose filters and washed with excess water. Incorporated radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Inhibitors were added 1 min before the addition of labeled substrate at the given concentrations. All inhibitors were purchased from Sigma. The facts that the yeast fen2 mutation caused a reduction in the ergosterol content (7Marcireau C. Joets J. Pousset D. Guilloton M. Karst F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), that FEN2 is a member of the allantoate permease family (4Nelissen B. De Wachter R. Goffeau A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 113-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that VHT1 (another member of this gene family) encodes the H+-biotin symporter of the yeast plasma membrane (2Stolz J. Hoja U. Meier S. Sauer N. Schweizer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18741-18746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) led us to the assumption that Fen2p may catalyze the uptake of a compound essential for sterol biosynthesis. As the specific activities of the enzymes involved in sterol biosynthesis were not impaired in the fen2 mutant (7Marcireau C. Joets J. Pousset D. Guilloton M. Karst F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), as coenzyme A is a carrier of activated C2 units in sterol biosynthesis, and as pantothenate is a biosynthetic precursor of coenzyme A, we speculated that Fen2p might be a plasma membrane-localized pantothenate transporter. This assumption was further supported by the fact that the specific activity of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, the first enzyme in the squalene biosynthetic pathway, was increased in the fen2 mutant (7Marcireau C. Joets J. Pousset D. Guilloton M. Karst F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). An increased activity of this first enzyme in the squalene biosynthetic pathway has previously been reported for wild-type cells grown under limiting pantothenate concentrations (18Servouse M. Karst F. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Initial support for our hypothesis was obtained from growth analyses of a FEN2 wild-type strain (711/1a) (12Agostini Carbone M.L. Panzeri L. Muzi Falcone M. Carcano C. Plevani P. Lucchini G. Yeast. 1992; 8: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and a fen2disruptant (711/1c) (12Agostini Carbone M.L. Panzeri L. Muzi Falcone M. Carcano C. Plevani P. Lucchini G. Yeast. 1992; 8: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) on media with different pantothenate concentrations (Fig. 1). Obviously, neither the wild-type nor the mutant cells were able to grow in the absence of pantothenate, but as little as 10 nmpantothenate was sufficient to support the growth of FEN2wild-type cells. In contrast, growth of the fen2 disruptant was detected only at pantothenate concentrations being at least 2000-fold higher, indicating a potential defect in the pantothenate transport. In the next step, the pantothenate uptake rates of the FEN2wild-type strain, of the fen2 disruptant, and of a strain carrying FEN2 on a multicopy plasmid (711/1c transformed with pFEN2mc) were measured. Fig. 2 shows the results of these experiments performed with ]14C[pantothenate. Uptake rates of FEN2wild-type cells were determined both in the absence and presence of 1%d-glucose. As transport rates were reproducibly higher whend-glucose was added, ]14C[pantothenate transport by the disruptant and the overexpressing strain was also determined in the presence of d-glucose. The ]14C[pantothenate uptake rate determined for theFEN2 wild-type strain in Fig. 2 was 75 nmol/h/g (fresh weight). The rates for the fen2 disruptant and theFEN2-overexpressing strain were 1 and 240 nmol/h/g (fresh weight), respectively (all rates were determined in the presence ofd-glucose). This shows that a fen2 gene disruption leads to a complete loss of ]14C[pantothenate transport and that overexpression of the FEN2 gene results in a 3-fold increase in ]14C[pantothenate transport, confirming our assumption that FEN2 encodes a plasma membrane pantothenate transporter. Initial evidence that Fen2p may represent an energy-dependent H+-pantothenate symporter came from the glucose stimulation of pantothenate transport shown in Fig. 2. This stimulation is due to a glucose-dependent stimulation of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (19Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 156: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Activation of the H+ pump leads to an increase both in the plasma membrane electrical potential (Δψ) and in the transmembrane proton gradient (ΔpH). Eventually, this results in enhanced transport rates of endogenous yeast H+ symporters (2Stolz J. Hoja U. Meier S. Sauer N. Schweizer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18741-18746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and of foreign H+ symporters expressed in yeast (20Sauer N. Stolz J. Plant J. 1994; 6: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). For further support of this assumption, we tested the effect of carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone, an uncoupler of transmembrane proton gradients, on Fen2p-dependent pantothenate transport (Table I). Carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone inhibited uptake of pantothenate by >70%, confirming the H+ dependence of pantothenate transport.Table IEffect of inhibitors on the uptake of [14C]pantothenate by S. cerevisiae at an initial pantothenate concentration of 10 μmInhibitor addedConc[14C]Pantothenate transportμm%None100 ± 1.4CCCPaCCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone.5028.2 ± 3.2Pantothenate1007.1 ± 0.9β-Alanine10089.9 ± 1.8Biotin10094.6 ± 9.5Lipoate100106.8 ± 8.9Ureidopropionate10093.9 ± 12.5γ-Amino-n-butyrate10090.8 ± 1.8Taurine10091.4 ± 8.3Gly-Asp10098.0 ± 9.4Pantoyllactone10085.2 ± 12.9Pantoyltaurine10077.5 ± 16.4Pantoyltaurine100068.5 ± 9.5a CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone. Open table in a new tab If the physiological function of Fen2p is the supply of yeast cells with pantothenate, the K m of this transporter should allow the efficient use of this vitamin at naturally occurring pantothenate concentrations ranging from 4 to 80 μm in different plant materials (21Blattná J. Fragner J. Vitamine, Chemie und Biochemie. Gustav Fischer Verlag Jena GmbH, Jena, Germany1965: 1232-1235Google Scholar). Analyses of ]14C[pantothenate transport at different extracellular concentrations revealed that the K m of Fen2p for pantothenate is 3.5 μm. This low value shows thatFEN2 encodes a high affinity transport system that can transport pantothenate at physiological concentrations with high rates. Fen2p belongs to the yeast allantoate permease family (4Nelissen B. De Wachter R. Goffeau A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 113-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a subgroup of the major facilitator superfamily (3Marger M.D. Saier Jr., M.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). With 512 amino acids (Fig.3 A), Fen2p is significantly shorter than the recently described Vht1p biotin transporter from yeast that is composed of 593 amino acids (2Stolz J. Hoja U. Meier S. Sauer N. Schweizer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18741-18746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons and a hydrophilicity analysis of Fen2p with the program TMpred (Fig.3 B) (22Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166Google Scholar) revealed that this is due to a shorter N terminus. Fen2p has 12 putative transmembrane helices and one consensus sequence for N-glycosylation (Asn293). According to the prediction in Fig. 3 B, this residue is located within a putative transmembrane helix and thus is unlikely to be glycosylated. Expression of the VHT1 gene encoding the yeast plasma membrane H+-biotin symporter is increased with decreasing extracellular biotin concentrations (2Stolz J. Hoja U. Meier S. Sauer N. Schweizer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18741-18746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To test whether a similar regulation exists for the FEN2 gene, 711/1a cells were grown on minimal medium supplemented with 0.1, 1, or 10 μm pantothenate, and the transport rates for pantothenate in these cells were compared. As shown in Fig.4, the transport capacity of the yeast cells was modulated by extracellular pantothenate concentrations, with the transport rates being higher at low extracellular pantothenate concentrations. It has been suggested previously that β-alanine may substitute pantothenate in growth media of S. cerevisiae(23Nielsen N. Hartelius V. Biochem. Z. 1938; 295: 211-225Google Scholar, 24Sarett H. Cheldelin V.H. J. Bacteriol. 1945; 49: 31-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We were interested to see whether the uptake of β-alanine, which represents a significant portion of the pantothenate molecule, is also catalyzed by Fen2p and whether β-alanine allows growth of thefen2 mutant on pantothenate-free media. In Fig.5, growth of a FEN2 wild-type strain and a fen2 mutant strain is compared at different concentrations of β-alanine on minimal medium without pantothenate. At a concentration of 0.1 μm β-alanine, no growth was detected, but both strains grew equally well in the presence of 1 and 10 μm β-alanine, indicating that β-alanine can substitute for pantothenate in wild-type and mutant cells. In addition, these data demonstrate that uptake of β-alanine is independent of Fen2p. This was confirmed when the transport of 14C-labeled pantothenate was analyzed in the presence of several potential competitors (Table I). Only pantoyltaurine, the sulfonic acid analog of pantothenate, had some inhibitory effect. Neither β-alanine nor pantoyllactone, the two substrates of the pantothenate synthetase, or any of the other structurally related compounds tested competed with pantothenate for Fen2p-catalyzed uptake. It has been shown previously that Gap1p (the yeast general amino acid permease), Put4p (the yeast proline transporter), and Uga4p (the yeast transporter for γ-amino-n-butyric acid) can catalyze the transport of γ-amino-n-butyric acid across the plasma membrane ofS. cerevisiae (25André B. Hein C. Grenson M. Jauniaux J.-C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As the structure of γ-amino-n-butyric acid is very similar to that of β-alanine, we speculated that β-alanine might also be transported by one of these amino acid permeases. In Fig.6, the uptake rates for14C-labeled β-alanine are compared in three different yeast strains: the wild-type strain Σ1278b (14Béchet J. Grenson M. Wiame J.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), thegap1-1 mutant strain 2512c (15Grenson M. Hou C. Crabeel M. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 103: 770-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the triple mutant 22574d (which is defective in the general amino acid permease gene GAP1, the proline transporter gene PUT4, and the γ-amino-n-butyric acid transporter geneUGA4) (16Jauniaux J.-C. Vandenbol M. Visser S. Broman K. Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The results demonstrate that β-alanine is taken up by the wild-type strain Σ1278b, but only to a much lesser extent by the gap1-1 mutant or the triple mutant, indicating that uptake of β-alanine is catalyzed primarily by the general amino acid permease Gap1p. It was first described in 1972 that GAP1 expression is modulated by the availability of NH4+ions in the medium (26Grenson M. Hou C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and it was demonstrated only recently that theGAP1 expression level increases ∼11-fold when yeast cells are shifted from rich medium (YPD) to minimal medium (27Wodicka L. Dong H. Mittmann M. Ho M.-H. Lockhart D.J. Nature Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). In Fig.7, we demonstrate that also the β-alanine import of FEN2 wild-type cells is ∼10-fold increased in cells grown on minimal medium compared with cells grown on rich medium. This correlation of increased GAP1 expression (27Wodicka L. Dong H. Mittmann M. Ho M.-H. Lockhart D.J. Nature Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar) and β-alanine transport capacity provides additional evidence that this amino acid is imported by the general amino acid permease ofS. cerevisiae. Fenpropimorph inhibits the accumulation of the pyrimidine bases uracil and cytosine from growth media in S. cerevisiae (28Crowley J.H. Lorenz R.T. Parks L.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1004-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Uracil prototrophs of S. cerevisiaewere more resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of fenpropimorph than were uracil auxotrophs. It was found later (7Marcireau C. Joets J. Pousset D. Guilloton M. Karst F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) that the product of the FEN2 gene confers sensitivity to this fungicide. The characterization of Fen2p as a pantothenate transporter suggests a more general effect of fenpropimorph on transport proteins. This is confirmed by the data presented in TableII. Fenpropimorph inhibited the transport of pantothenate by Fen2p to ∼75%. However, this inhibition was not specific, and the transport of other substrates (such lysine and biotin, which enter the cells by H+ symport) or of glucose (which enters the cells by facilitated diffusion) was also inhibited.Table IIInhibition of different transport systems by 3 mmfenpropimorphSubstrateInhibition%Pantothenate76.1d-Glucose76.8l-Lysine85.5Biotin92.9 Open table in a new tab This paper describes the functional characterization of the FEN2 gene product as a H+-pantothenate symporter of the S. cerevisiae plasma membrane.FEN2 represents the first characterized gene encoding a H+-pantothenate symporter. Uptake of pantothenate is stimulated by d-glucose (Fig. 2), an activator of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (19Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 156: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and is inhibited by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, an uncoupler of transmembrane proton gradients (Table I). Fen2p is a high affinity transport protein with a K m for pantothenate of 3.5 μm, allowing optimal uptake of pantothenate at physiological concentrations (21Blattná J. Fragner J. Vitamine, Chemie und Biochemie. Gustav Fischer Verlag Jena GmbH, Jena, Germany1965: 1232-1235Google Scholar). Fen2p is essential for growth ofS. cerevisiae on media with low pantothenate concentrations (Fig. 1). Uptake of pantothenate is modulated by extracellular pantothenate concentrations (Fig. 4), being maximal when the concentration of the vitamin is low. Sequence analyses of Fen2p (Fig. 3) predicted 12 putative transmembrane helices and revealed significant sequence homology to Dal5p (5Rai R. Genbauffe F.S. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 266-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Vht1p (2Stolz J. Hoja U. Meier S. Sauer N. Schweizer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18741-18746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fen2p shares no sequence homology with the pantothenate transporter from Escherichia coli(PanF) (29Reizer J. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Res. Microbiol. 1990; 141: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or the SMVT multivitamin transporter from rat, which accepts pantothenate, biotin, and lipoate (30Prasad P.D. Wang H. Kekuda R. Fujita T. Fei Y.-J. Devoe L.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7501-7506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These transporters are Na+-dependent and share homology with the Na+-dependent proline transporter of E. coli (PutP) (31Nakao T. Yamato I. Anraku Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 208: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and the Na+-dependent mammalian glucose transporter (SGLT) (32Hediger M.A. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5748-5752Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), which are not part of the major facilitator superfamily (29Reizer J. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Res. Microbiol. 1990; 141: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). FEN2, DAL5, and VHT1 are likely to have evolved from a common ancestral transporter gene. Identification of common structural motifs in their substrates (Fig.8) may reveal information on the substrates of the five additional, so far uncharacterized transporters of this family (4Nelissen B. De Wachter R. Goffeau A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 113-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Obviously, all of the substrates presented in Fig.8 are carboxylates, and the presence of this group seems to be essential. Allantoin, which differs from allantoate (the substrate of Dal5p) by only the absence of this carboxylate group, is taken up by the product of the S. cerevisiae DAL4 gene, which is not a member of the allantoate transporter family (33Yoo H.S. Cunningham T.S. Cooper T.G. Yeast. 1992; 12: 997-1006Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but is closely related to FUR4, the gene of the S. cerevisiaeuracil permease (34Jund R. Weber E. Chevallier M.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Similarly, pantoyltaurine, the sulfonic acid analog of pantothenate, is a poor competitor for pantothenate (TableI). The substrates of Dal5p and Vht1p possess a ureido group, which is absent from pantothenate. However, the amide bond formed by the pantothenate synthetase between the amino group of β-alanine and the carboxyl group of pantoate forms a similar structure, which may represent the second common recognition domain within this group of transporters. This suggests that members of the allantoate transporter family transport carboxylates containing a ureido group or an amide bond. Dipeptides fulfilling these criteria, such as Gly-Asp, do not compete with pantothenate (Table I). Gap1p (35Jauniaux J.-C. Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) catalyzes the uptake of β-alanine, and a mutation in the GAP1 gene causes a drastic reduction in the transport rates for β-alanine (Fig. 6). In agreement with earlier reports describing the regulation ofGAP1 expression by NH4+ ions (26Grenson M. Hou C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and increased GAP1 expression on minimal medium (27Wodicka L. Dong H. Mittmann M. Ho M.-H. Lockhart D.J. Nature Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), the transport of β-alanine is repressed under optimal nitrogen supply (Fig. 7). This indicates that S. cerevisiae is conditionally pantothenate-auxotrophic, requiring alternatively pantothenate or β-alanine for growth. These findings explain the previously described phenotype of thefen2-1 mutant strain CM2 (7Marcireau C. Joets J. Pousset D. Guilloton M. Karst F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This strain exhibited reduced ergosterol and fatty acid biosynthesis only when grown on complete medium, but not on minimal medium. Both media contain sufficient amounts of the vitamin pantothenate. However, varying amounts of the heat-labile vitamin are degraded when the medium is autoclaved, and one product of this thermal degradation is β-alanine (36Waller J.R. Appl. Microbiol. 1970; 20: 857-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1J. Stolz, unpublished data. Thus, FEN2wild-type cells can utilize undegraded pantothenate via Fen2p (on minimal and complete media) and its degradation product (β-alanine) via Gap1p (on minimal medium only). In contrast, fen2mutants are unable to import pantothenate and grow only on minimal medium due to Gap1p-dependent import of β-alanine. Therefore, fen2 mutants will not display the mutant phenotype on minimal medium, but will grow with low rates and reduced ergosterol content on rich medium. As a consequence of these complex interconnections, it was suggested that FEN2 encodes a protein responsible for the coregulation of carbon catabolite repression, nitrogen catabolite repression, and the general control of amino acid and ergosterol biosynthesis (7Marcireau C. Joets J. Pousset D. Guilloton M. Karst F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Consistent with the central position of coenzyme A as a carrier of acyl groups in metabolism, fen2 mutations leading to a reduced availability of pantothenate for coenzyme A biosynthesis have pleiotropic phenotypic effects. Mutations inFEN2 result in a reduced biosynthesis of ergosterol and fatty acids and in retarded growth under conditions of nitrogen catabolite repression. Likewise, resistance to fenpropimorph, a further consequence of fen2 mutations, is observed only under these conditions (7Marcireau C. Joets J. Pousset D. Guilloton M. Karst F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of FEN2 wild-type cells to fenpropimorph cannot be explained by a specific interaction of the fungicide with Fen2p (i) because transport of different substrates is inhibited by fenpropimorph to a similar extent (Table II) and (ii) because sensitivity to fenpropimorph is also seen in fen2 mutants grown on minimal medium when GAP1 is expressed (7Marcireau C. Joets J. Pousset D. Guilloton M. Karst F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This rather suggests that the fungicidal effect of fenpropimorph depends on the availability of intracellular pantothenate and thus of acetyl-CoA, the primary substrate of ergosterol biosynthesis, and malonyl-CoA, the substrate for fatty acid biosynthesis and elongation. One could speculate that the inhibition of sterol Δ8,7-isomerase and C14 sterol reductase, the primary target proteins of fenpropimorph (8Lorenz R.T. Parks L.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1991; 35: 1532-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Kelly D.E. Rose M.E. Kelly S.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 122: 223-226PubMed Google Scholar, 10Engels A.J.G. Holub E.F. Swart K. De Waard M.A. Curr. Genet. 1998; 33: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 11Sajbidor J. Lamacka M. Balaz S. Huong L.M. Ciesarova Z. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1998; 50: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), depends on a high substrate input into this pathway. Alternatively, the sensitivity to fenpropimorph may be modulated by the membrane composition,i.e. by the relative amounts of the products of acetyl-CoA-dependent biosynthetic pathways. This model is supported by the finding that FEN1, another yeast gene conferring fenpropimorph resistance (37Revardel E. Bonneau M. Durrens P. Aigle M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 19: 261-265Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 38Silve S. Leplatois P. Josse A. Dupuy P.H. Lanau C. Kaghad M. Dhers C. Picard C. Rahier A. Taton M. Le Fur G. Caput D. Ferrara P. Loison G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2719-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), is allelic toELO2, which encodes a protein involved in fatty acid elongation and sphingolipid formation (39Oh C.-S. Toke D.A.

Both the production of very-long-chain fatty acids and sphingolipid formation depend on malonyl-CoA and may therefore be reduced in fen2 mutants when pantothenate levels are low. Mutants carrying a fen1mutation exhibit slightly increased (rather than decreased) ergosterol levels (40Ladevèze V. Marcireau C. Delourme D. Karst F. Lipids. 1993; 28: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We therefore speculate that the antifungal activity of fenpropimorph depends on the membrane composition, specifically on the content of very-long-chain fatty acids and/or sphingolipids, and that fenpropimorph interacts directly with these membrane components. The inhibition of fungal growth by the structurally different antifungal polyene antibiotics, such as amphotericin B and nystatin, is also due to an interaction with specific membrane components (41Bolard J.

https://openalex.org/W2024128028,"In this study, we investigated the involvement of caspases in TGFβ-induced apoptosis in human B cells. Our results show that TGFβ-mediated nuclear fragmentation, observed in the Epstein – Barr virus-negative Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line BL41, was abolished in the presence of the tripeptide caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk or the specific caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD-fmk. Other apoptotic manifestations such as cell shrinkage, surface phosphatidylserine expression and chromatin condensation were strongly inhibited by ZVAD-fmk but only partially by DEVD-fmk. This suggests that other caspases in addition to caspase-3 control these apoptotis-associated features. Specific activation of caspase-3 during TGFβ-induced apoptosis was demonstrated by the DEVD-fmk-sensitive expression of the active p17 subunit of caspase-3 and by in vivo cleavage of PARP. In addition, TGFβ treatment of BL41 promoted the expression of both dephosphorylated and truncated forms of the retinoblastoma protein. Inhibition of caspase-3 activity abolished both nuclear fragmentation and expression of the truncated retinoblastoma protein, without modifying the G1 cell cycle arrest induced by TGFβ. Our data thus demonstrate that TGFβ-induced apoptosis of lymphoma B lymphocytes is dependent on caspase activation and involves caspase-dependent cleavage of the retinoblastoma protein."

A mutant strain with strongly reduced biotin uptake and with reduced levels of protein biotinylation was identified. The strain was auxotrophic for long-chain fatty acids, and this auxotrophy could be suppressed with high levels of biotin in the medium. After transformation of this mutant with a yeast genomic library, the unassigned open reading frame YGR065C was identified to complement this mutation. This gene codes for a protein with 593 amino acids and 12 putative transmembrane helices. Northern blot analysis revealed that, in wild-type cells, the corresponding mRNA levels were increased at low biotin concentrations. Likewise, cellular biotin uptake was increased with decreasing biotin availability. Expression ofYGR065C under the control of the constitutiveADH1 promoter resulted in very high biotin transport rates across the plasma membrane that were no longer regulated by the biotin concentration in the growth medium. We conclude thatYGR065C encodes the first biotin transporter identified for a non-mammalian organism and designate this gene VHT1 forvitamin Htransporter1.

Enzymes depending on enzyme-bound biotin (vitamin H) as a carrier of CO2 in carboxylation, decarboxylation, and transcarboxylation reactions are found throughout the biological world (1Dakshinamurti K. Chalifour L. Bhagavan H.N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1985; 447: 38-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 2Knowles J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 195-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Some organisms, such as Escherichia coli and all higher plants, are able to synthesize biotin de novo(3Eisenberg M. Neidhard F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 544-550Google Scholar). However, many other organisms including mammals have lost this capability and are auxotrophic for biotin. The biotin requirement of yeast is well documented for many industrial and laboratory strains ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae (4Leonian L.H. Lilly V.G. Am. J. Bot. 1942; 29: 459-464Crossref Google Scholar) including strain S288C (5Mortimer R.K. Johnston J.R. Genetics. 1986; 113: 35-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whose genome has been sequenced. Due to this deficiency, S. cerevisiae has been used in growth assays for the microbiological determination of biotin (6Hertz R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1943; 52: 14-17Google Scholar). In bakers' yeast, the covalent attachment of biotin to biotin-dependent enzymes is catalyzed by a biotin-protein ligase, which is encoded by the essential BPL1 gene (7Cronan Jr., J.E. Wallace J.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 130: 221-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the best studied substrates for Bpl1p are acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1p) and the two isoforms of pyruvate carboxylase (Pyc1p and Pyc2p). Acc1p catalyzes the first step of fatty acid biosynthesis,i.e. the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. A loss of functionally active Acc1p produces a lethal phenotype that cannot be rescued by the supply of fatty acids from the growth medium (8Haßlacher M. Ivessa A.S. Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10946-10952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Schneiter R. Hitomi M. Ivessa A.R. Fasch E.M. Kohlwein S.D. Tartakoff A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7161-7172Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This is caused by an impairment of the malonyl-CoA-dependent elongation of long-chain fatty acids to very-long-chain fatty acids, which is assumed to be essential for the nuclear pore structure in yeast (9Schneiter R. Hitomi M. Ivessa A.R. Fasch E.M. Kohlwein S.D. Tartakoff A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7161-7172Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Pyc1p and Pyc2p generate oxaloacetate from pyruvate. This reaction is required for the anaplerotic synthesis of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates during gluconeogenesis or amino acids biosynthesis. Apyc1/pyc2 double mutant is no longer able to grow on glucose with ammonia as the sole nitrogen source. Growth of the double mutant is restored when l-aspartate is added to regenerate the oxaloacetate pool (10Stucka R. Dequin S. Salmon J.-M. Gancedo C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A similar phenotype was described for another yeast, Pichia pastoris, after deletion of its single pyruvate carboxylase gene (11Menendez J. Delgado J. Gancedo C. Yeast. 1998; 14: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Pioneering work on biotin transport in S. cerevisiae has been done by Rogers and Lichstein (12Rogers T.O. Lichstein H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 557-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rogers T.O. Lichstein H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 565-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who described a carrier-mediated, high affinity (apparent k m = 0.3 μm), and energy-requiring uptake mechanism. They showed that intracellular concentrations of biotin could exceed biotin concentration in the medium >1000-fold and that this uptake was stimulated by glucose. Rogers and Lichstein also discovered that uptake of biotin is controlled by the biotin level in the growth medium. High levels of biotin reduced the rate of catalyzed biotin uptake. Further support for a specific biotin uptake mechanism in yeast came from the finding that biotin uptake was irreversibly inhibited by thep-nitrophenyl ester of biotin, presumably due to covalent modification of the transport system (14Becker J.M. Wilchek M. Katchalski E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2604-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 62: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Despite the extensive biochemical studies on many aspects of biotin transport in yeast, neither the biotin transporter nor its gene has been identified to date. In this paper, we report on the characterization of a yeast mutant (A7-9) that was isolated in a screen for fatty acid auxotrophy. It is demonstrated that the fatty acid auxotrophy in A7-9 results from a defect in biotin uptake from the environment. Complementation of A7-9 with a genomic library led to the identification of the open reading frame YGR065C. The encoded protein exhibits significant structural and sequence homologies to the large family of 12-transmembrane helix transporters. We provide evidence that this gene encodes the biotin transporter of S. cerevisiae and named the gene VHT1 forvitamin Htransporter1. The following yeast strains were used in this work: JS 91.15-5 (MATa, ura3, his3,leu2, Δino4::LEU2), JS 91.15-23 (MATα, ura3, leu2,trp1, his3, can1), and BF 89.4-36 (MAT a,Δfas1::HIS3, his3,ura3, trp1). Strains 74.2-12C (MATα,ilv1, ade2, suc 0) and JS 89.27-3 (MAT a, ura3, leu2,trp1) were used for backcrosses. The fatty acid-auxotrophic mutant A7-9 was isolated upon methanesulfonic acid ethyl ester mutagenesis of JS 91.15-5 and subsequent selection of fatty acid-requiring mutants by replica plating on synthetic complete dextrose (SCD) 1The abbreviations used are: SCD, synthetic complete dextrose; SD, synthetic dextrose; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s). agar with and without fatty acid supplementation. Details were as described previously (16Mishina M. Roggenkamp R. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The YEp24-based genomic library used for complementation was described before (17Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The library plasmid pA7-T8, which complemented the mutation of A7-9, was isolated as described in the text. The single copy plasmid pVHT1sc carrying the VHT1 gene under the control of its own promoter was constructed in two steps. The 3.2-kilobase EcoRV fragment of pA7-T8 was ligated into theSmaI site of pUC19, excised with SacI andHindIII, and cloned into the corresponding sites of YCplac33 (18Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar). For construction of the constitutivelyVHT1-overexpressing plasmid pVHT1oe, the PCR-amplified open reading frame of VHT1 (primers SM15-PstI (5′-TGACCTGCAGATGACAATTTCGAATAAATCGTGGAGG-3′) and SM12-SacI (5′-AGTCGAGCTCATAGAACGTATAAGGTGACC-3′)) was cloned into thePstI and SacI sites of the multicopy plasmid pVT100-U (19Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The sequence of the PCR product was verified. Plasmid YEp24 (20Botstein D. Falco S.C. Stewart S.E. Brennan M. Scherer S. Stinchcomb D.T. Struhl K. Davis R.W. Gene (Amst.). 1979; 8: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) was used as a vector control. Media for S. cerevisiae were prepared as described (21Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Synthetic dextrose (SD) medium contained 0.67% Bacto-yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco, Augsburg, Germany) and 2% glucose and was supplemented with the necessary amino acids to meet the growth requirements of the strains. SCD medium was prepared from SD medium by adding a complete mixture of l-amino acids and the nucleobases adenine and uracil. Fatty acids were added as described previously (16Mishina M. Roggenkamp R. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The biotin concentration in SD and SCD media prepared with Difco yeast nitrogen base without amino acids is 2 μg/liter. Media with other biotin concentrations were made from analytical grade chemicals according to the formula of Difco for yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (omitting biotin), dissolved at 10 times the final concentration, filter-sterilized, and stored at 4 °C. Biotin was added to these media from an autoclaved stock (100 mg/liter) to give the desired final concentrations. The VHT1 gene was disrupted in JS 91.15-23 by short flanking homology-mediated recombination (22Wach A. Brachat A. Rebischung C. Steiner S. Pokorni K. te Heesen S. Phillipsen P. Methods Microbiol. 1998; 26: 67-81Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, theS. cerevisiae HIS3 gene was PCR-amplified using primers 5-YGR065C-HIS3 (5′-GGACCGACACAAATCAATAGATAATGACAATTTCTCTTGGCCTCCTCTAG-3′) and 3-YGR065C-HIS3 (5′-TATGGTGTCTAAAGCGTAATATACCTATCTACTTCGTTCAGAAGTACACG-3′), which added 34 bp of VHT1 sequence (underlined) from near the ATG start codon (boldface) and 35 bp of VHT1 sequences (underlined) from a region 15 bp downstream of the stop codon to either side of HIS3, respectively. Yeast cells were transformed with the PCR product and plated on SD plates lacking histidine but containing excess biotin (2 mg/liter). Transformants were replica-plated on SD plates containing 2 μg of biotin/liter. Cells unable to grow under these conditions were checked by PCR for correct integration of the HIS3 gene into VHT1. The verified disruptant is referred to as JSYΔvht1. Yeast transformations (23Gietz D. Jean A.S. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar) and plasmid isolations from S. cerevisiae (24Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar) were performed as described. Yeast strain JS 91.15-23 was grown to mid-logarithmic phase in SD medium containing 0.2, 2, or 20 μg of biotin/liter. RNA was prepared, separated on agarose gels, and transferred to a nylon membrane according to standard protocols (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). AVHT1 hybridization probe was generated by PCR with primers SM15 (5′-TGACCTGCAGATGACAATTTCGAATAAATCGTGGAGG-3′) and SM7 (5′-GCCGTCTTTCAGCCTTGG-3′) and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Control hybridizations were carried out with a PCR-generated fragment corresponding to the entire coding region of the S. cerevisiae ACT1 actin gene (primers ACT1-fwd (5′-TGGTATGTTCTAGCGCTTGCA-3′) and ACT1-rev (5′-TGGTGAACGATAGATGGACCA-3′)). Yeast cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase (A 600 nm ∼ 1.0 in SD medium or ∼ 3.0 in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2%d-glucose)), harvested by centrifugation, and washed once with ice-cold water. After washing in citrate/phosphate buffer (30 mm citric acid and 40 mmNa2HPO4, pH 4.2), the cells were resuspended in buffer to give 16 mg (fresh weight)/ml and incubated in a rotatory shaker at 30 °C. Cells were energized with glucose (1% final concentration), and the assay was started by the addition of14C-labeled biotin (Amersham CFB 253; specific activity = 8.38 mCi/mmol, 10.7 μm final concentration). At timed intervals, cells were filtered on nitrocellulose filters and washed with excess water. Incorporated radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Inhibitors were added 1 min before the addition of labeled substrate at the given concentrations. All inhibitors were obtained from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Fatty acid-auxotrophic mutants have been assigned to four distinct chromosomal loci, i.e. the fatty acid synthase genes FAS1 and FAS2 and theACC1 and BPL1 genes encoding the acetyl-CoA carboxylase and the biotin-protein ligase, respectively (16Mishina M. Roggenkamp R. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 26Schweizer E. Werkmeister K. Jain M.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1978; 21: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Hoja U. Wellein C. Greiner E. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, several fatty acid-auxotrophic yeast strains that are non-allelic to any of the above-mentioned loci 2E. Schweizer, unpublished data. were available to us. We speculated that a defective biotin transport system in a biotin-dependent organism such as S. cerevisiaeshould cause fatty acid auxotrophy, i.e. a phenotype similar to that observed in bpl1 mutants. The fatty acid-auxotrophic phenotype of one of the unassigned mutants, strain A7-9, is demonstrated in Fig. 1. Virtually no growth was observed when A7-9 cells were supplemented with saturated medium-chain fatty acids (caprylate (C8) or caprinate (C10)). However, this growth defect was suppressed in the presence of long-chain fatty acids (laurate (C12), myristate (C14), or palmitate (C16)). Analysis of [14C]biotin transport across the plasma membrane revealed that A7-9 is completely defective in biotin uptake (Fig. 2 A). The transport rates in A7-9 were >100-fold below wild-type levels. Although the intracellular concentrations of biotin in wild-type cells clearly exceeded the extracellular concentration, the biotin level in A7-9 cells was far below the concentration equilibrium. Increased extracellular biotin concentration suppressed the fatty acid-auxotrophic phenotype in A7-9 and restored normal growth (Fig.2 B), probably due to increased passive diffusion of biotin into the cells. Thus, A7-9 is a conditionally fatty acid-auxotrophic mutant that requires long-chain fatty acids or biotin for growth. Compared with wild-type cells, A7-9 needs ∼100-fold higher vitamin H concentrations for optimal growth. As evident from Fig. 2 B, already 2 μg of biotin/liter allowed full growth of the wild type, whereas growth of the mutant was barely supported. On YPD complete medium with no extra biotin added, A7-9 showed almost wild-type growth rates (data not shown). Streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase was used to determine the degree of protein biotinylation in strains A7-9 and BF 89.4-36. A7-9 cells were grown on SD medium supplemented with both long-chain fatty acids andl-aspartate to suppress deficiencies possibly caused by a reduced biotinylation of Acc1p, Pyc1p, and Pyc2p carboxylases. As a control, the mutant was also grown on SCD medium supplemented with excess biotin (1 mg/liter). After separation of cellular proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent transfer to nitrocellulose, three biotinylated bands corresponding to Acc1p, the pyruvate carboxylase isoforms Pyc1p and Pyc2p, and a 47-kDa protein of unknown function (28Brewster N.K. Val D.L. Walker M.E. Wallace J.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were detected in wild-type and mutant cells grown on excess biotin (Fig. 3). On medium supplemented with fatty acids and l-aspartate, biotinylation of these proteins was strongly reduced in A7-9 cells, but not in wild-type cells. The reduced biotinylation of Acc1p in A7-9 was paralleled by a loss of acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity (data not shown). The biochemical characteristics of A7-9 suggest that a high affinity biotin transporter is affected in this mutant. As a consequence of reduced biotin uptake, protein biotinylation and activity of Acc1p are decreased, and growth depends on the external supply of long-chain fatty acids. Biotin at high external concentrations can restore wild-type levels of protein biotinylation and supports growth in a fatty acid-independent fashion. The wild-type allele of the gene affected in strain A7-9 was isolated by complementing the mutant with a yeast genomic library constructed in the high copy vector YEp24 (17Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Among 11,000 uracil-prototrophic colonies, 15 were able to grow on SCD plates lacking fatty acids. Two of three isolated plasmids (pA7-T8 and pA7-T10) had identical inserts of ∼8 kilobases, and the third harbored a larger, overlapping DNA fragment. Fig. 4 shows that full complementation was also achieved with plasmid pVHT1sc, which contains a 3.2-kilobase EcoRV fragment of pA7-T8 subcloned into the single copy plasmid YCplac33 (18Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of pVHT1sc identified a 3233-bp fragment from chromosome VII covering the open reading framesYGR063C,YGR064W, and YGR065C. The open reading frameYGR063C has previously been identified as SPT4, a gene coding for a zinc-finger protein involved in regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression (29Swanson M.S. Winston F. Genetics. 1992; 132: 325-336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Malone E.A. Fassler J.S. Winston F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The open reading frame YGR064W codes for a putative protein of 122 amino acids with one potential transmembrane domain. It overlaps withSPT4 and thus is unlikely to be transcribed. Therefore, onlyYGR065C was likely to be responsible for the complementation of A7-9. A DNA fragment containing only the YGR065C reading frame was generated by PCR and subcloned into pVT100-U (19Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) downstream of the strong and constitutive ADH1 promoter to give plasmid pVHT1oe. After transformation with this construct, A7-9 was able to grow in the absence of fatty acids (Fig. 4), indicating thatYCR065C indeed complements the mutation in A7-9. YGR065C, which has no functional assignment in public data bases, codes for a protein of 593 amino acids (Fig.5 A). A hydrophobicity analysis of this sequence (Fig. 5 B) (31Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166Google Scholar) suggested 12 transmembrane domains, a number that has been found in numerous plasma membrane transporters (32Henderson P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 708-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). According to the prediction, Ygr065p starts with a long hydrophilic domain of 120 amino acids, and both the N and C termini are on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Six asparagine residues are part of consensus sequences forN-glycosylation. Two of these residues are located on the extracellular surface (Asn146, between transmembrane domains 1 and 2, and Asn406, between transmembrane domains 7 and 8) and might thus be accessible for glycosylation during protein secretion. Ygr065p belongs to a family of eight putative yeast transporter proteins (33Nelissen B. De Wachter R. Goffeau A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 113-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is part of the major facilitator superfamily (34Marger M.D. Saier Jr., M.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). So far, a function has been attributed to only two members of this group: Dal5p, the plasma membrane-localized permease for allantoate and ureidosuccinate (35Rai R. Genbauffe F.S. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 266-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Turoscy V. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2598-2600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Fen2p, the plasma membrane-localized pantothenate transporter (37Stolz J. Sauer N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18747-18752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Ygr065p shares 21 and 28% amino acid identities with Dal5p and Fen2p, respectively. We named the gene represented by this open reading frame (GenBankTM accession number Z72850) VHT1 for vitamin Htransporter 1. TheVHT1 gene was disrupted in strain JS 91.15-23; transformants were selected on SD plates containing 2 mg of biotin/liter; and disruptants were identified on plates containing 2 μg of biotin/liter. These cells had the HIS3 marker gene correctly integrated at the VHT1 locus and are referred to as JSYΔvht1. By genetic complementation analysis, JSYΔvht1 proved to be allelic to the A7-9 mutant. Moreover, all biochemical parameters investigated, such as biotin- or fatty acid-dependent growth, biotin uptake, and protein biotinylation, were the same in both mutants (data not shown). Biotin transport activity inS. cerevisiae is modulated by the biotin content of the media. The activity increases with decreasing biotin concentrations, and protein biosynthesis is necessary for this increase in activity (13Rogers T.O. Lichstein H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 565-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We analyzed the biotin transport activities of A7-9 cells expressing VHT1 under the control of its own promoter from the centromere plasmid pVHT1sc and, alternatively, of A7-9 cells that carried the VHT1 coding region downstream of the strong and constitutive ADH1 promoter in the multicopy plasmid pVHT1oe. After growth in SD medium with 0.2, 2, or 20 μg of biotin/liter, biotin uptake was determined (Fig. 6). In agreement with previous data (13Rogers T.O. Lichstein H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 565-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we observed a pronounced effect of the extracellular biotin concentration on biotin uptake in pVHT1sc transformants expressing VHT1 from its genuine promoter. The biotin transport rate was maximal at 0.2 μg of biotin/liter and became very low at 2 and 20 μg of biotin/liter (Fig. 6 A). As expected, biotin transport rates in pVHT1oe transformants were increased and independent of extracellular biotin concentrations (Fig.6 B), suggesting that regulatory sequences in theVHT1 promoter are responsible for the biotin responsiveness seen in Fig. 6 A. For further analyses, RNA was prepared from JS 91.15-23 wild-type cells grown on 0.2, 2, or 20 μg of biotin/liter and probed with a radiolabeled VHT1 fragment on a Northern blot. A single hybridization signal corresponding to a mRNA of ∼1900 bp was observed in each of the three samples (Fig.7). VHT1 mRNA was most abundant at 0.2 μg of biotin/liter. VHT1 mRNA was less abundant at 2 μg/liter, and the level was even further reduced at 20 μg of biotin/liter. These results are in good agreement with the biotin transport activities determined above (Fig. 6 A) and show that extracellular biotin concentrations modulate VHT1mRNA levels and thereby Vht1p transport activity. A recently identified mammalian vitamin transporter, SMVT, transports the three vitamins biotin, pantothenate, and lipoate with similar affinities by means of a Na+symport mechanism (38Prasad P.D. Ramamoorthy S. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Placenta. 1997; 18: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 39Prasad P.D. Wang H. Kekuda R. Fujita T. Fei Y.-J. Devoe L.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7501-7506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Transport of [14C]biotin by Vht1p was not inhibited when pantothenate was added at 10 times the concentration of biotin (data not shown). Also other compounds with structural similarity to biotin, such as allantoin, allantoate, xanthine, uric acid, and urea, had no effect on biotin transport (data not shown), suggesting that Vht1p is specific for biotin. Vht1p-dependent [14C]biotin transport was further characterized by measuring its activity in the presence of protonophores (such as 2,4-dinitrophenol and carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone), the membrane-impermeable SH-modifying agent p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid, or the above-mentioned inhibitor of biotin transport (biotinyl-p-nitrophenyl ester) (Fig.8). In accordance with published data (14Becker J.M. Wilchek M. Katchalski E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2604-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), biotinyl-p-nitrophenyl ester strongly reduced biotin transport to values <4% of the uninhibited activity. The protonophores 2,4-dinitrophenol and carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone inhibited transport rates by 81 and 86%, respectively, suggesting a proton symport mechanism for biotin uptake. p-Chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid had no effect on biotin transport. The gene responsible for the fatty acid-auxotrophic phenotype of the yeast mutant A7-9 was identified, and the encoded protein was characterized as a plasma membrane-localized biotin transporter. The gene was named VHT1 for vitaminHtransporter 1. Additional phenotypic effects associated with a vht1 mutation include the inability to grow at low biotin concentrations sufficient for wild-type yeast strains. Furthermore, the mutant exhibited drastically reduced protein biotinylation and hence a very low activity of the biotin-dependent enzyme Acc1p. All of these effects can be suppressed with high extracellular concentrations of biotin when the passive diffusion of this vitamin across the plasma membrane is sufficient to meet the biotin demand of the cells. Also inE. coli, high external concentrations of biotin are reported to allow import of biotin by diffusion (40Barker D.F. Campbell A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 789-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VHT1 was identified by complementation of the mutant A7-9 with a yeast genomic library. It encodes a membrane protein from the allantoate permease family. Several lines of evidence confirm thatVHT1 codes for the biotin transporter of the S. cerevisiae plasma membrane. (i) Vht1p shows sequence homology to Dal5p, a yeast plasma membrane transporter specific for allantoate and ureidosuccinate, which are structurally related to biotin; and similarly, Vht1p is related to Fen2p, a yeast plasma membrane transporter for pantothenate. (ii) Disruption of VHT1results in the inability to grow on SD medium at low biotin concentrations (2 μg/liter). The complete loss of biotin uptake activity (Fig. 1) shows that Vht1p is the only high affinity biotin transporter encoded in the yeast genome. (iii) Overexpression ofVHT1 under the control of the ADH1 promoter causes a dramatic increase in biotin transport activity irrespective of the biotin content of the medium (Fig. 6 B). (iv)VHT1 mRNA levels and biotin uptake rates are modulated by extracellular biotin and increase as a consequence of biotin limitation (Figs. 6 A and 7). (v) Biotinyl-p-nitrophenyl ester, a strong inhibitor of biotin transport in S. cerevisiae, inhibits Vht1p-dependent biotin transport by >90%. The last two findings confirm results previously obtained from biochemical and kinetic analyses of yeast biotin transport (12Rogers T.O. Lichstein H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 557-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rogers T.O. Lichstein H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 565-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Becker J.M. Wilchek M. Katchalski E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2604-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of biotin uptake to uncouplers of transmembrane proton gradients (such as 2,4-dinitrophenol and carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone) suggests that Vht1p mediates the H+-coupled symport of biotin. Consistent with this interpretation, biotin transport leads to intracellular accumulation of biotin and is stimulated by glucose (12Rogers T.O. Lichstein H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 557-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a sugar that directly activates the proton-extruding ATPase of the yeast plasma membrane (41Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 156: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Biotin uptake studies performed with intact mammalian cells (42Dyer D.L. Said H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) or with tissue-derived membrane vesicles (43Grassl S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17760-17765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) clearly indicated a Na+ symport mechanism for biotin. Most remarkably, uptake of biotin was competitively inhibited by pantothenic acid and lipoate, suggesting a single protein for the uptake of all three vitamins (38Prasad P.D. Ramamoorthy S. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Placenta. 1997; 18: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,44Grassl S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22902-22906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was confirmed after the recent cloning and heterologous expression of the rat SMVT gene in Xenopus laevisoocytes (39Prasad P.D. Wang H. Kekuda R. Fujita T. Fei Y.-J. Devoe L.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7501-7506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The Na+-dependent SMVT protein, which belongs to the Na+-dependent glucose transporter family, exhibits no structural homology to the H+-dependent Vht1p protein characterized in this study. E. coli, like most bacteria, is able to synthesize biotin, and indeed, most of the biotin required by humans is not derived from the diet, but rather from the intestinal microflora (45Bonjour J.-P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1985; 447: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although being prototrophic for biotin, E. coli also takes up this vitamin by a carrier-mediated, saturable, high affinity (k m = 0.14 μm), and energy-dependent process (46Prakash O. Eisenberg M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 120: 785-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As in S. cerevisiae, biotin transport in E. coli is suppressed by the biotin concentration in the media (46Prakash O. Eisenberg M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 120: 785-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Piffetau A. Gaudry M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 816: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To date, no information is available on bacterial biotin transporters. A BLAST search (48Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar) in publicly available data banks using Vht1p as query sequence yielded no match. In conclusion, plants and most bacteria are able to synthesize biotin and do not depend on biotin uptake. In contrast, mammals and yeast are unable to synthesize biotin, but efficiently accumulate biotin from their environment. In yeast, the biotin transporter is only synthesized when required, i.e. at very low extracellular biotin concentrations. The biotin transporters of mammals and yeast are clearly different, both structurally and functionally. Thus, the yeast biotin transporter may represent a suitable target for new antifungal drugs with applications in agriculture and medicine. We thank H.-J. Schüller (Universität Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany) for providing yeast strains and for fruitful discussions and M. Weider, P. Rothe, and M. Ramsperger for experimental help."
https://openalex.org/W2017290264,"Perfringolysin O (θ-toxin) is a pore-forming cytolysin whose activity is triggered by binding to cholesterol in the plasma membrane. The cholesterol binding activity is predominantly localized in the β-sheet-rich C-terminal half. In order to determine the roles of the C-terminal amino acids in θ-toxin conformation and activity, mutants were constructed by truncation of the C terminus. While the mutant with a two-amino acid C-terminal truncation retains full activity and has similar structural features to native θ-toxin, truncation of three amino acids causes a 40% decrease in hemolytic activity due to the reduction in cholesterol binding activity with a slight change in its higher order structure. Furthermore, both mutants were found to be poor at in vitro refolding after denaturation in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, resulting in a dramatic reduction in cholesterol binding and hemolytic activities. These activity losses were accompanied by a slight decrease in β-sheet content. A mutant toxin with a five-amino acid truncation expressed in Escherichia coli is recovered as a further truncated form lacking the C-terminal 21 amino residues. The product retains neither cholesterol binding nor hemolytic activities and shows a highly disordered structure as detected by alterations in the circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence spectra. These results show that the C-terminal region of θ-toxin has two distinct roles; the last 21 amino acids are involved to maintain an ordered overall structure, and in addition, the last two amino acids at the C-terminal end are needed for protein folding in vitro, in order to produce the necessary conformation for optimal cholesterol binding and hemolytic activities.

Thiol-activated cytolysins (1Alouf J.E. Geoffroy C. Alouf J.E. Freer J.H. Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, London1991: 147-186Google Scholar) comprise a family of bacterial protein toxins that are produced by Gram-positive bacteria. They share a high degree of homology in their amino acid sequences (40–70%) (2Tweten R.K. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 3235-3240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shimizu T. Okabe A. Minami J. Hayashi H.

Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7301-7305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and have common biological characteristics, cholesterol binding and the formation of oligomeric pores on plasma membranes. Perfringolysin O (472 amino acids), known as θ-toxin, is such a toxin produced by Clostridium perfringens type A. Its cytolytic mechanism is thought to comprise at least four steps: binding to cholesterol in membranes, insertion into the membrane, oligomerization, and pore formation. θ-Toxin binds specifically to cholesterol on plasma membranes with high affinity (K d ∼ 10−9m) (8Ohno-Iwashita Y. Iwamoto M. Mitsui K. Ando S. Nagai Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). By forming oligomeric pores on plasma membranes (9Mitsui K. Sekiya T. Nozawa Y. Hase J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 554: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), θ-toxin causes cell disruption. After several attempts to crystallize θ-toxin (10Sugahara M. Sekino-Suzuki N. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Miki K. J. Crystal Growth. 1996; 168: 288-291Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 11Feil S.C. Rossjohn J. Rohde K. Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 290-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), its three-dimensional structure was recently revealed by x-ray diffraction (12Rossjohn J. Feil S.C. McKinstry W.J. Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). This analysis showed θ-toxin to be an elongated rod-shaped molecule rich in β-sheets and to consist of four discontinuous domains. Domain 4 (Fig. 1 b) (residues 363–472), the C-terminal domain, is an autonomous structure comprising a continuous amino acid chain. Six of the seven total tryptophan residues reside in domain 4, and three are located in the sequence of ECTGLAWEWWR (residues 430–440), the longest conserved sequence among thiol-activated cytolysins (2Tweten R.K. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 3235-3240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shimizu T. Okabe A. Minami J. Hayashi H. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 137-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From many efforts to achieve mutagenesis of this toxin family (13Sekino-Suzuki N. Nakamura M. Mitsui K. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 14Bhakdi S. Bayley H. Valeva A. Walev I. Walker B. Weller U. Kehoe M. Palmer M. Arch.

Lett. 1994; 121: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it was shown that all mutations that inhibit cell binding activity reside in domain 4, suggesting that some region in domain 4 binds to membrane cholesterol upon binding to cells. This is consistent with our previous findings that a C-terminal tryptic fragment that contains predominantly domain 4 binds to cholesterol and to cholesterol-containing membrane (18Iwamoto M. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Ando S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our findings that the toxin binding to cholesterol in liposomal membrane triggers a conformational change around tryptophan residues in domain 4 also support this view (19Nakamura M. Sekino N. Iwamoto M. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6513-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 20Nakamura M. Sekino-Suzuki N. Mitsui K. Ohno-Iwashita Y. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recently, possible roles of the C-terminal region in cell binding were suggested by a report that a monoclonal antibody thought to bind near the C terminus specifically blocks cell binding, although the exact epitope was not identified (21de los Toyos J.R. Mendez F.J. Aparicio J.F. Vazquez F. Suarez M.M.G. Fleites A. Hardisson C. Morgan P.J. Andrew P.W. Mitchell T.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 480-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this finding, it is not known whether the C-terminal region plays a role in cholesterol binding or membrane insertion activity, inasmuch as either one could affect toxin binding to cells. Recent x-ray crystallographic analysis showed that there are two β-strands in antiparallel orientation in the C-terminal end and that one of them is composed of 7 amino acids in the C-terminal end (12Rossjohn J. Feil S.C. McKinstry W.J. Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Here, we constructed and analyzed toxin mutants truncated in the C terminus to define the role of the C-terminal region on cholesterol binding activity. Using an ELISA 1The abbreviations used are: ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; CD, circular dichroism; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)- propane-1,3-diol; ESI, electrospray ionization; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.assay for quantitative analysis of cholesterol binding activity, we show that the C-terminal end is essential for folding of θ-toxin into the native conformation, thus ensuring activities of cholesterol binding and hemolysis. Anti-θ-toxin antibody was obtained by immunizing rabbits as described previously (18Iwamoto M. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Ando S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cholesterol, subtilisin Carlsberg, and isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside were purchased from Sigma. DEAE-Sephacel was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-(rabbit IgG) serum was purchased from Seikagaku (Tokyo, Japan). Plasmid pNSP10 containing the perfringolysin O gene (pfoA) (13Sekino-Suzuki N. Nakamura M. Mitsui K. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was used to construct six pfoA derivatives encoding truncated θ-toxins. Stop codons were introduced at appropriate sites in the pfoA gene by a site directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) based on the unique site elimination method (22Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The 5′-deoxyoligonucleotide, dGTGACTGGTGAGGCCTCAACCAAGTC, was used to make a unique restriction site for the selection of all mutations. Stop codon insertion was performed using the following mutagenic primers for: Δ471, 5′-deoxynucleotide dCAGTTTTTACTTTAGTaTAcTatTAAGTAATACTAG; Δ470, dCTTTAGTTTAATTtTAtcaAATACTgGATCCAGGGT; Δ468, dGTTTAATTGTAAGTttatCagGATCCAGGGT. Lowercase letters represent bases changed for mutagenesis. The DNA sequences in the resulting plasmids were confirmed by means of the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52671) Google Scholar). Predicted amino acid sequences in the C-terminal ends of the mutant toxins are shown in Fig. 1. Protein production and purification were performed as described previously (13Sekino-Suzuki N. Nakamura M. Mitsui K. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Escherichia coli strains BL21(DE3) and BL21(DE3) harboring pLysS (24Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar) (Novagen, Madison, WI) were used for the overexpression of wild type θ-toxin and mutant toxins. Wild type θ-toxin and mutant toxins were purified from the periplasmic fraction by a series of DEAE-Sephacel chromatographies. In the case of mutant toxins having no hemolytic activity, the fractions eluted from the first DEAE-Sephacel column were analyzed by immunostaining with anti-θ-toxin antibody after SDS-PAGE. Then, the toxin fractions were loaded onto a second DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated with 20 mm BisTris, pH 6.5, and eluted with the same buffer containing 40 mm NaCl. For further purification, the toxin fractions were applied to a hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and the toxins were eluted with 100 mm sodium phosphate. Then, the toxins were loaded onto a butyl-agarose column equilibrated with 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1.7 m(NH4)2SO4 and eluted with 0.5m (NH4)2SO4. The purity of the toxins was checked by SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Hemolytic activity was determined as described previously (26Saito M. Ando S. Tanaka Y. Nagai Y. Mitsui K. Hase J. Mech. Aging Dev. 1982; 20: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The amount of toxin required for 50% hemolysis of 1 ml of 0.5% sheep erythrocytes in 30 min at 37 °C (HD50) was determined using the von Krogh equation (27Mayer M.M. Kabat E.A. Kabat and Mayer's Experimental Immunochemistry. 2nd Ed. Thomas, Springfield, IL1961: 133-240Google Scholar). The hemolytic activity of each toxin was obtained as a 1/HD50 value and expressed relative to the wild type toxin. After activation with 10 mmdithiothreitol for 30 min at 10 °C, each toxin (0.3 μg) was incubated with 0.5% hematocrit sheep erythrocytes in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 20 min at 20 °C. The mixture was centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and both the pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. The cholesterol binding activity of each toxin was examined by using TLC plates as described previously (13Sekino-Suzuki N. Nakamura M. Mitsui K. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 18Iwamoto M. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Ando S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The cholesterol binding activity of each toxin was determined by ELISA using the microtiter plate (Immulon 1, Dynatech Laboratories, Alexandria, VA). The wells were coated with various concentrations of cholesterol (12 - 10,000 pmol) and treated with 10 mg/ml fatty-acid-free bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h for blocking. Toxins (each 1 ng) were then added to the wells and the mixtures were incubated for 1 h. After washing with Tris-buffered saline, the mixtures in the wells were incubated with anti-(θ-toxin) antibody for 1 h, followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h. Toxins bound to the cholesterol on the microtiter plates were detected by measuring the intensity at 410 nm of the color development with 2,2′-azino-di[3-ethyl-benzthiazoline sulfonate(6)] (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) as a peroxidase substrate. Purified toxins (600 ng each) were treated at 22 °C with subtilisin Carlsberg at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:60 (28Ohno-Iwashita Y. Iwamoto M. Mitsui K. Kawasaki H. Ando S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6048-6053Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). At appropriate times, the digestion was stopped by the addition of 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The resultant fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting by using anti-(θ-toxin) antibody. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded using a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter at room temperature with 1-or 5-mm pathlength cells. Purified proteins were diluted in 10 mm phosphate buffer with or without 150 mm NaCl. Scans from 250 to 190 nm were recorded with 1-mm cells in the absence of NaCl to minimize buffer noise. Molecular ellipticity ([θ]) was calculated based on the mean residue weight and extinction coefficient ( E2800.1%) estimated as 110.8 and 1.6, respectively. The CONTIN program for secondary structure estimation was kindly provided by Dr. S. W. Provencher. Fluorescent studies were performed with a Shimadzu spectrofluorophotometer RF-5000. Emission spectra were measured in the range of 300–400 nm with an excitation wavelength of 280 or 295 nm. Purified toxins were diluted with Hepes-buffered saline, pH 7.0, to a protein concentration of 10 μg/ml. Wild type and mutant toxins were unfolded by treatment with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl at room temperature for 10–30 min. Denaturation was confirmed by a red shift in the fluorescence emission wavelength to 350 nm at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. Refolding was carried out by dialyzing the samples against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl at 4 °C for 20 h. N-Terminal sequences of wild type and mutant toxins were analyzed with a Biosystems protein sequencer 476A. The molecular masses of the toxins were measured by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) using a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer BioApex47E (Bruker Instruments) equipped with an external ESI source (Analytica of Branford). Before being injected into the source by a syringe pump operated at 30 μl/h, the samples were desalted on a reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography column (Senshu Pak C8–1251-N) eluted with a 10–60% gradient of acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. In some cases, the samples were prepared from the SDS-PAGE gel by the method of Nakayama et al. (29Nakayama H. Uchida K. Shinkai F. Shinoda T. Okuyama T. Seta K. Isobe T. J. Chromatogr. A. 1996; 730: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE, the gel was washed with distilled water and stained with 0.3 mCuCl2 for 3 min. The toxin spot was excised from the SDS-PAGE gel and destained successively in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 12.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3. Then, the toxin was extracted from the gel in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, containing 50 mm EDTA and 0.1% SDS. To remove SDS and other impurities, the extracted toxin was applied to a Phenyl-5PW RP column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) and recovered with 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. When this method was used, the molecular mass of θ-toxin was determined by subtracting the mass of the adduct of copper, 63.4, from the observed mass. θ-Toxin mutants truncated at the C terminus were constructed and expressed in E. coli as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Figs.1 and 2). θ-Toxin has an intrinsic signal sequence at its N terminus and is secreted into the periplasm when expressed in E. coli (Fig.2 and Ref. 13Sekino-Suzuki N. Nakamura M. Mitsui K. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A similar expression profile was observed for Δ471 and amounts comparable to wild type θ-toxin were recovered from the periplasmic fraction (Fig. 2). A slightly smaller amount was recovered in the case of Δ470. Upon expression of the DNA construct for Δ468 and mutants with larger truncations, the amounts of proteins with molecular sizes close to that of intact θ-toxin decreased with concomitant increases in the amounts of degradation products with sizes around 38 kDa (Fig. 2 and data not shown). The results suggest that truncations at the C terminus affect the biosynthesis of θ-toxin and/or its secretion into the periplasm. To further characterize the mutant toxins, the expressed proteins were purified from the periplasmic fraction by DEAE-Sephacel column chromatographies and their molecular masses were determined by ESI-MS (Table I). The observed molecular masses of wild type, Δ471, and Δ470 are within the range of the predicted molecular masses. In contrast, the observed moleculer mass of the protein recovered from the cells harboring the constructed plasmid for Δ468 is smaller than the predicted mass for Δ468 (Table I). This indicates that the production of the protein with a five-amino acid C-terminal truncation brings about a further truncated form. N-terminal sequence analysis revealed that the product has the same N-terminal sequence as the wild type toxin. From the results of N-terminal and molecular mass analyses, we conclude that the product comprises residues 1–451 (predicted M r, 50,375.6), with a 21-amino acid truncation at the C terminus. We designate the product as Δ452 hereafter. The elution profile of Δ452 is different from those of wild type θ-toxin and two mutants, Δ471 and Δ470; the former eluted from DEAE-Sephacel column at 110 mm NaCl, whereas the latter two mutants eluted at 60 mm.Table IMolecular masses of wild type and mutant toxins measured by electrospray ionization mass spectrometryToxinObserved M rPredictedM rWild type52,671.4 ± 1.852,672.0Δ47152,394.3 ± 2.352,394.7Δ47052,295.9 ± 2.352,293.6Δ46850,384.0 ± 1852,093.4Refolded wild type52,673.6 ± 2.052,672.0Refolded Δ47152,395.7 ± 4.452,394.7 Open table in a new tab The relative hemolytic activities of purified wild type and three mutant toxins were determined (Fig. 3,upper part). No differences in hemolytic activity were detected between wild type θ-toxin and Δ471, indicating that the deletion of two amino acids from the C terminus of θ-toxin does not affect hemolytic activity. In contrast, Δ470 showed a lower hemolytic activity, 40% that of wild type, while Δ452 showed no hemolytic activity. These results indicate that truncation of the C terminus by 21 amino acids causes a loss of hemolytic activity. Hemolysis by θ-toxin involves two important steps, binding and insertion into membranes, prior to pore formation. The binding activity to cells was measured and compared among the wild type and mutant toxins (Fig. 3, lower part). Δ471 showed high-affinity binding to sheep erythrocytes similar to the wild type, but Δ470 showed only very weak binding. Δ452, which has no hemolytic activity, never bound to the cells. These results show a good correlation between cell binding activity and relative hemolytic activity. Cholesterol on plasma membranes serves as a receptor for θ-toxin. Fig. 4 a shows the cholesterol binding activity of mutant toxins on TLC plates as detected by immunostaining with anti-θ-toxin antibody. Δ471 and Δ470 were found to bind to cholesterol on TLC plates and to specifically recognize free cholesterol but not phosphatidylcholine or esterified cholesterol. Their manner of binding was the same as that of wild type toxin, although Δ470 shows weaker spots. On the other hand, Δ452 did not bind to cholesterol at all. Fig. 4 b shows the quantitative analysis of the cholesterol binding activity of the toxins by ELISA. Δ471 shows an activity comparable to the wild type toxin. The activity of Δ470 is about 40% of the wild type, while no activity could be detected for Δ452. The results show that the cholesterol binding activity of the toxins correlates well with their cell binding and hemolytic activities. We previously reported that mutants with Trp to Phe substitutions within the tryptophan-rich consensus sequence show decreased binding affinity for erythrocytes (13Sekino-Suzuki N. Nakamura M. Mitsui K. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We examined the cholesterol binding activity of two such mutants, W438F and W439F, by ELISA and compared the results with the cholesterol binding activity of the C-terminal truncation mutants (Fig. 4 b). Mutants with Trp to Phe substitutions show cholesterol binding activity similar to that of the wild type toxin (Fig. 4 b), showing that mutations of Trp in the consensus sequence has little effect on the cholesterol binding activity. The decrease in cell binding activity of the mutants should be attributable to step(s) other than cholesterol binding. This makes a district difference from the results for the mutants with C-terminal truncations. The defects in the cholesterol binding activities of Δ470 and Δ452 can be attributed to either the deletion of cholesterol-binding sites or conformational changes around the binding sites. To assess these possibilities, we first examined the susceptibility of mutant toxins to a protease (Fig.5). Digestion of wild type θ-toxin and Δ471 by subtilisin Carlsberg produced a distinctive 39-kDa fragment assigned as the C-terminal fragment (28Ohno-Iwashita Y. Iwamoto M. Mitsui K. Kawasaki H. Ando S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6048-6053Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); a smaller amount of this fragment was detected when Δ470 was digested. In contrast, Δ452 was digested over time into undetectable pieces showing no distinctive bands. Trypsin digestion also produced proteolytic fragments of 28 and 25 kDa (18Iwamoto M. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Ando S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) from Δ471 and Δ470, but not from Δ452 (data not shown). The results indicate that the secondary or tertiary structures of Δ452 has been changed by C-terminal truncation of 21 amino acid residues. Because six out of the seven tryptophan residues in θ-toxin are located in the C-terminal region (see Fig. 1), it is reasonable to measure tryptophan fluorescence in order to monitor the conformational alterations of θ-toxin induced by truncation. When the toxins were excited at 295 nm, no differences in the peak emission wavelength at 338 nm were detected between wild type and two mutants, Δ471 and Δ470 (Table II), showing that the environmental changes around the Trp residues are not significant in those two mutants. However, environmental changes around some fluorophores other than tryptophan appear to have occurred, since the mutants exhibited a red shift in the maximal emission wavelength when excited at 280 nm (Table II). On the other hand, a distinctive red shift of the maximal emission wavelength was observed for Δ452 as compared with the wild type toxin (Table II), indicating that the environment of the tryptophan residues in these mutants is more hydrophilic than in the wild type. Simultaneously, the intensity of the tryptophan fluorescence in Δ452 excited at 295 nm was enhanced to 3.2 times that of the wild type θ-toxin. The results suggest that the inactive mutant Δ452 has significant alteration in its tertiary structure around tryptophan residues, and that this leads to the loss in hemolytic activity.Table IIMaximal emission wavelengths and the relative intensity of wild type and truncated toxinsToxinEmission maximum (λex)Relative intensity280 nm295 nm280 nm295 nmnm%Wild type332338100100Δ471334338106 ± 3127 ± 3Δ470336338115 ± 2135 ± 3Δ452340342241 ± 3319 ± 4The fluorescence measurements of wild type and truncated toxins were carried out at excitation wavelengths (λex) of 280 and 295 nm.

Open table in a new tab The fluorescence measurements of wild type and truncated toxins were carried out at excitation wavelengths (λex) of 280 and 295 nm. The data represent mean ± S.E. for three independent experiments. Maximal emission wavelengths are displayed in nanometers (nm), and the maximal intensity of each mutant is shown relative to the intensity of the wild type toxin. When θ-toxin interacts with cholesterol on dioleoylphosphatidyl choline/cholesterol liposomes, there is an increase in the intensity of the tryptophan fluorescence (19Nakamura M. Sekino N. Iwamoto M. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6513-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The two truncated toxins, Δ471 and Δ470, also showed increases in the intensity when incubated with dioleoylphosphatidyl choline/cholesterol liposomes. In contrast, no enhancement of fluorescence intensity was detected for Δ452 (data not shown). Therefore, this mutant lacks an appropriate structure for interaction with cholesterol in membranes. In order to determine whether the deletion of C-terminal amino acids affects the secondary structure of the toxin, far ultraviolet CD spectra were measured. As shown in Fig.6 a, wild type θ-toxin has a β-sheet-rich structure and the spectra of Δ471 and Δ470 closely resemble that of the wild type toxin. On the other hand, drastic difference was detected in the spectrum of Δ452 as compared with the wild type toxin. A significant increase in negative ellipticity was observed at 208 nm and shorter wavelengths. The CD difference spectrum obtained by subtracting the wild type spectrum from the Δ452 spectrum exhibited a deep minimum at 200 nm or a shorter wavelength and a shoulder at around 225 nm. This difference spectrum resembles that usually taken to indicate an unfolded conformation (30Chang C.T. Wu C.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). This observation suggests a large disorder in the secondary structures of Δ452. The structural analysis suggests that several amino acids at the C terminus play essential roles in in vivo protein folding and/or the maintenance of protein conformation. We carried out in vitrorefolding experiments on the truncated mutants to define the function of C-terminal amino acids during folding. Wild type θ-toxin and mutant Δ471 (truncated by two amino acids) were denatured in 6m GdnHCl, renatured by dialysis, and their hemolytic activities were measured. As shown in Fig.7 a (upper part), wild type θ-toxin recovered 81% of full hemolytic activity while Δ471 displayed only 13% recovery, even though Δ471 has an activity comparable to the wild type before denaturation. The refolded Δ471 hardly bound to sheep erythrocytes as shown in Fig.7 a (lower part), showing a good correlation with relative hemolytic activity. To investigate whether the refolded Δ471 recognizes cholesterol, the cholesterol binding activity was measured by ELISA. The refolded Δ471 shows much less cholesterol binding activity than native Δ471, while the activity of the wild type toxin is not changed by the denaturation refolding treatment (Fig. 7 b). Although we could not judge whether all the refolded Δ471 molecules have lower binding affinities than in the native state or whether a small population of Δ471 refolds to the native form with full activity, it is clear that Δ471 easily loses its ability to bind cholesterol during the denaturation-renaturation process. A decrease in the cholesterol binding activity was also observed after denaturation-refolding of Δ470 (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that there might be a minor contaminating protease that cleaves the Δ471 protein during the refolding treatment and causes it to lose activity, the relative molecular masses of native and refolded Δ471 were determined by ESI-MS (Table I). The relative molecular masses determined for the refolded Δ471 and native Δ471 are the same and within the range of the predicted one (Table I), indicating that no proteolytic cleavage occurs during the refolding process. Wild type toxin also maintains its intact size during refolding treatment, as shown by the relative molecular masses before and after treatment (Table I). These results indicate that the loss of Δ471 activity after refolding is not caused by the action of protease. The above results show that even just two amino acid residues at the C terminus are involved in the correct folding of θ-toxin. To assess whether the inactivation of Δ471 by denaturation-refolding is accompanied by a conformational alteration, the structural properties of wild type and Δ471 after denaturation-refolding treatment were studied by CD and fluorescence analyses. Compared with native Δ471, the far-ultraviolet CD spectrum of refolded Δ471 shows a slight alteration in the secondary structure (Fig. 6 b), a 3% decrease in β-sheet content and a concomitant increase in random coil in the refolded Δ471 as estimated by the algorism program, CONTIN (31Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). In the case of the wild type θ-toxin, no differences were observed in the CD spectra before and after refolding (data not shown). In the maximal emission wavelength of the fluorescence spectrum, no significant changes were observed in both wild type and Δ471. These results clearly show that the secondary and tertiary structural changes in the refolded Δ471 are small compared with those observed for Δ452 (Fig. 6 a and Table II), suggesting that the changes in refolded Δ471 occur in a limited region of the toxin molecule. The crystallographic study of θ-toxin showed that domain 4, the C-terminal domain supposed to contain the cholesterol-binding region, has nine β strands folded into a compact β-sheet sandwich (12Rossjohn J. Feil S.C. McKinstry W.J. Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Two β strands in antiparallel orientation are located within the C-terminal 20 amino residues and form a part of one β sheet (Fig. 1). In this study, focusing on the two C-terminal β strands, we constructed several C-terminal truncated θ-toxin mutants to investigate how C-terminal amino acids contribute to the folding of the protein and its toxic action. We first demonstrated that amino acids in the C-terminal β strand play an important role in correct folding of the toxin. When Δ471 was refolded after denaturation in 6 m GdnHCl, it lost its membrane binding and hemolytic activities with the reduction in cholesterol binding activity (Fig. 7), indicating the importance of the two C-terminal amino acids for correct folding in vitro into the conformation required for cholesterol binding. However, Δ471 showed essentially the same hemolytic activity and secondary structure as wild type θ-toxin. This indicates that the mutant folds into the native conformation in vivo. Taking the difference betweenin vivo and in vitro folding into consideration, probably chaperone-like molecules help to achieve correct folding in vivo (32Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar, 33Fedorov A.N. Baldwin T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32715-32718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). As shown in Δ470, a three-amino acid truncation affects folding both in vivo andin vitro. The truncation of five amino acids from the C terminus leads to a further truncation of the protein in host E. coli, indicating that the C-terminal β strand protects the protein against proteolytic cleavage in host cells. For toxin production, we usedE. coli B strain, BL21(DE3), as a host, because it lacks both lon and ompT proteases. Some other minor protease(s) in E. coli may contribute to cleaving the product during synthesis or secretion into the periplasm (34Cook R.A. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 1988; 8: 159-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The product, Δ452, lacks the two β strands in the C terminus and completely loses its cell binding and hemolytic activities due to its inability to recognize cholesterol (Fig. 4). It is likely that the molecular structure required for the specific binding of cholesterol molecules is absent or not correctly organized in Δ452. Spectroscopic data indicate its partially unfolded secondary structure and an environmental alteration around tryptophan residues to a more hydrophilic and unrestricted state (Fig. 6 a and Table II). Since the elimination of the two β strands from the C-terminal end causes this remarkable disorder in structure, the C-terminal two β strands are suggested to play key roles in constructing the overall structure of the toxin. There are two distinct steps in cell binding by θ-toxin, cholesterol recognition and membrane insertion. In this study we demonstrated that truncation of the C terminus abolishes cholesterol-recognition ability, resulting in the loss of cell binding activity. This is in contrast to mutants with Trp to Phe substitutions within the tryptophan-rich consensus sequence (residues 430–440), which show a loss in cell binding activity despite their ability to bind cholesterol (Fig.4 b and Ref. 13Sekino-Suzuki N. Nakamura M. Mitsui K. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We previously suggested that the tryptophan-substituted mutants have some deficiency in membrane insertion activity (13Sekino-Suzuki N. Nakamura M. Mitsui K. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 20Nakamura M. Sekino-Suzuki N. Mitsui K. Ohno-Iwashita Y. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that could cause them to lose cell binding activity. The tryptophan-rich consensus sequence locates in close proximity to one of the two β sheets in domain 4, and distant from the other β sheet to which the C-terminal β strand belongs (Fig.1 b). The crystallographic data indicate that there are some amino residues in the proximal β sheet that are possible quenchers of the fluorescence of Trp-436 and Trp-439, Trps within the consensus sequence. Thus, a change in tryptophan fluorescence intensity could be a sensitive marker for a change in three-dimensional arrangement among these Trp residues and quenchers. Since either Δ470 or refolded Δ471 shows no significant change in tryptophan fluorescence compared with the wild type toxin, the microenvironment around the Trp residues remains intact in these mutants. This strongly suggests that the C-terminal truncation does not affect the structural features around the tryptophan-rich consensus sequence despite its significant effect on cholesterol binding activity. Probably the site of cholesterol binding is in different region in domain 4 from that of membrane insertion. Since the molecular mass of Δ471 remains unchanged by the unfolding-refolding treatment (Table I), the activity loss in cholesterol binding should be ascribed to a conformational change. It is likely that the molecular structure required for the specific binding of cholesterol molecules is not correctly organized after treatment. An approximately 3% decrease in β- sheet content in Δ471 was detected after treatment. No change occurs in tryptophan fluorescence as discussed above. This implies that the change occurs within a limited region upon refolding of Δ471 and that this local change in structure directly affects the cholesterol-binding site. Since the C-terminal β strand interacts directly with the next β strand (residues 453–460) by hydrogen bonding to form part of an antiparallel β sheet (Fig. 1 and Ref. 12Rossjohn J. Feil S.C. McKinstry W.J. Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), it is likely that the decrease in β-sheet content produced by treatment occurs near these strands. It has been reported that C-terminal truncation of pneumolysin, another cholesterol-binding cytolysin, causes a loss of cell binding activity (17Owen R.H.G. Andrew P.W. Boulnois G.J. Michell T.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 121: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to know whether this loss in the cell binding activity of pneumolysin is due to the loss of cholesterol binding activity, although conformational studies and molecular mass determination of the truncated species of pneumolysin would be required to draw a conclusion. There have been several reports showing that C-terminal residues are important for the correct folding and maintenance of the native protein conformations (35Voziyan P.A. Tremblay J.M. Yarbrough L.R. Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12526-12531Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 36Chen Y. Lin S. Tzeng S. Patel H.V. Lyu P. Cheng J. Proteins. 1996; 26: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Among them, θ-toxin is a distinct example since the deletion of only two amino acids from the C terminus out of a total of 472 residues seriously affects its folding and the maintenance of the functional conformation. We have reported chemically modified θ-toxin as a new probe for cholesterol (37Iwamoto M. Morita I. Fukuda M. Murota S. Ando S. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1327: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). If the relationships between binding activity and the conformation of the C-terminal region are clarified and the minimum binding unit is identified, further design of useful probes can be realized.

In addition to smooth muscle contraction, many fundamental cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, and division depend upon the interaction of myosin with actin in contractile filaments (reviewed in Ref. 12Narumiya S.

Activation of transfected M3 mAChR induces MLC phosphorylation and causes myosin-containing stress fibers to form in CHO cells. The involvement of PKC in these events is indicated by our findings that 1) direct activation of PKC with phorbol esters induces MLC phosphorylation and myosin reorganization in CHO cells, 2) specific PKC antagonists inhibit M3 mAChR-mediated myosin reorganization, and 3) activation of transfected M1 but not M2 mAChR subtypes also induces the formation of myosin-containing stress fibers, demonstrating that only mAChR subtypes that stimulate PKC activity induce myosin reorganization. The participation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and RhoA in mAChR-mediated myosin reorganization was also investigated, since these proteins regulate contractile processes in other systems (reviewed in Refs. 9Somylo A.P. Somylo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 10Takuwa Y. Jpn. Heart J. 1996; 37: 793-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Savineau J.P. Marthan R.

We found that MLCK antagonists inhibit mAChR-mediated myosin reorganization but only at antagonist concentrations that may affect PKC. Stable expression of dominant negative RhoAAsn-19 or inactivation of Rho with C3 exoenzyme lessens mAChR-mediated myosin reorganization but does not abolish it.This study demonstrates that M3 mAChR activation significantly affects myosin organization in non-muscle cells. Our findings indicate that M3 mAChR activation induces cytoplasmic myosin reorganization by both PKC- and Rho-dependent mechanisms. These receptor-mediated changes in cytoplasmic myosin may contribute to the unique ability of M3 mAChR to regulate the adhesion (18Williams C.L. Hayes V.Y. Hummel A.M. Tarara J.E. Halsey T.J. J.

Conventional PKC isoforms and Rho proteins participate in the mAChR-mediated formation of myosin stress fibers, as depicted in the model shown in Fig. 10. Similar pathways of mAChR-mediated myosin reorganization occur in CHO cells and smooth muscle cells, although some differences exist. Comparing these pathways provides insight into the mAChR-mediated mechanisms controlling myosin organization.Role of PKC in mAChR-mediated Myosin ReorganizationPKC participates in mAChR-mediated myosin reorganization in CHO cells. This conclusion is supported by our finding that M3 mAChR stimulation or PMA treatment activates several PKC isoforms and induces myosin stress fiber formation in these cells. Our finding that myosin reorganization is induced by the M1 but not the M2 mAChR subtype also supports this conclusion, since the M1 but not the M2 mAChR subtype activates PKC (2Caulfield M.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 58: 319-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 3Felder C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar).The effects of the PKC antagonists Go6976, calphostin C, and chelerythrine provide compelling evidence that conventional PKC isoforms are required for myosin reorganization. Both mAChR-mediated stress fiber formation and cell spreading are inhibited by calphostin C or chelerythrine, which antagonize conventional and novel PKC isoforms (34Tamaoki T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 35Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). In contrast, only mAChR-mediated myosin reorganization is inhibited by Go6976, which specifically antagonizes conventional PKC isoforms (36Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M.

It is generally believed that PKC activation is required for cell spreading, and other signals are required for cytoskeletal reorganization (45Jarvinen M. Ylanne J. Vartio T. Virtanen I. Eur. J.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that while the novel PKC isoforms are needed for cell spreading, the conventional PKC isoforms are needed for myosin reorganization.The concentrations of Go6976, calphostin C, or chelerythrine which inhibit myosin reorganization in CHO cells are approximately 10–70-fold higher than those that inhibit PKC in vitro(34Tamaoki T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 35Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Higher concentrations of these drugs may be needed in vivo for the antagonists to cross the cell membrane and gain access to intracellular PKC, in contrast to in vitro studies in which the antagonists interact directly with purified PKC. Despite this requirement for higher drug concentrations in vivo, these antagonists still inhibit myosin reorganization more effectivelyin vivo than they inhibit other kinases such as PKA in vitro. This finding indicates that these antagonists inhibit myosin reorganization by inactivating PKC.The ability of PKC to regulate myosin organization in CHO cells is consistent with the effects of PKC activation on smooth muscle myosin. Activation of PKC with phorbol esters enhances MLC phosphorylation in smooth muscle cells and induces sustained contraction of different smooth muscle tissues (reviewed in Ref. 10Takuwa Y. Jpn. Heart J. 1996; 37: 793-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MLC increases actin-myosin interactions by inducing the formation of bipolar myosin filaments and exposing actin-binding sites on myosin (reviewed in Refs. 9Somylo A.P. Somylo A.V.

PKC can directly phosphorylate MLC (52Bengur A.B. Robinson E.A. Apella E. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7613-7617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J.

Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 265-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It is believed that smooth muscle contraction induced by phorbol esters involves the PKC-dependent inhibition of MLC phosphatase, rather than direct phosphorylation of MLC by PKC (reviewed in Refs.9Somylo A.P. Somylo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 10Takuwa Y. Jpn. Heart J. 1996; 37: 793-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Savineau J.P. Marthan R. Fundam. Clin. Pharmacol. 1997; 11: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PKC activation may similarly enhance MLC phosphorylation in CHO cells by inhibiting MLC dephosphorylation, as depicted in Fig. 10.Although PKC is required for carbachol-induced myosin reorganization in CHO-m3 cells, the role of PKC in the mAChR-mediated regulation of smooth muscle myosin is less clear. PKC antagonists inhibit carbachol-induced contractions in some types of smooth muscle (55Satoh M. Hayasaka M. Horiuchi K. Takayanagi I. Gen. Pharmacol. 1998; 30: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) but not in others (56Bremerich D.H. Warner D.O. Lorenz R.R. Shumway R. Jones K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L775-L781PubMed Google Scholar). These variable responses may be due to the expression of different mAChR subtypes or PKC isoforms by different types of smooth muscle.It was previously shown that PKC activation induces or enhances the formation of actin-containing stress fibers in some types of non-muscle cells (45Jarvinen M. Ylanne J. Vartio T. Virtanen I. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 44: 238-246PubMed Google Scholar, 47Defilippi P. Venturino M. Gulino D. Duperray A. Boquet P. Fiorentini C. Volpe G. Palmieri M. Silengo L.

Cell Sc i. 1992; 101: 277-290PubMed Google Scholar) but not in others (58Ridley A.J. Hall A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2600-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). These results indicate that PKC activation has cell type-specific effects on stress fiber formation. These specific effects may be due to altered PKC isoform expression or dissimilarities in PKC-mediated signaling pathways among different cell types.Activation of M3 mAChR induces greater MLC phosphorylation and myosin reorganization than does treatment with PMA in CHO cells. We found that PKC-α remains at the junctions of carbachol-treated cells longer than it does in PMA-treated cells, indicating that mAChR stimulation and PMA treatment have different effects on PKC-α. These differences may contribute to the greater stress fiber formation induced by carbachol compared with PMA, as well as the sustained elongation of CHO-m3 cells which occurs during prolonged carbachol exposure (Fig. 1, panel D, and Fig. 4 a, panel D) (21Felder C.C. MacArthur L. Ma A.L. Gusovsky F. Kohn E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1706-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Singer-Lahat D. Ma A.L. Felder C.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).Role of RhoA in mAChR-mediated Myosin ReorganizationIncreased stress fiber formation in cells expressing constitutively active RhoAVal-14 indicates that active RhoA contributes to myosin reorganization in CHO-m3 cells. However, active RhoA is not essential for mAChR-mediated myosin reorganization in CHO-m3 cells. This conclusion is supported by our finding that carbachol-induced stress fiber formation is diminished but not abolished in CHO-m3 cells expressing dominant negative RhoAAsn-19 or treated with C3 exoenzyme. Expression of dominant negative RhoAAsn-19 may specifically inhibit RhoA activity because dominant negative RhoAAsn-19 competitively interacts with RhoA regulatory proteins. In contrast, C3 exoenzyme can ADP-ribosylate several forms of Rho, including RhoA and RhoB (59Mohr C. Koch G. Just I. Aktories K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), resulting in potentially greater Rho inactivation than that produced by expressing dominant negative RhoAAsn-19. Consistent with these possibilities, we found that the morphology of CHO-m3 cells is altered more drastically by C3 exoenzyme than by expression of dominant negative RhoAAsn-19.Treatment with C3 exoenzyme causes CHO-m3 cells to become multi-nucleate, which is an indication of Rho inactivation (60Rubin E.J. Gill D.M. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 61Mabuchi I. Hamaguchi Y. Fujimoto H. Morii N. Mishima M. Narumiya S. Zygote. 1993; 1: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 62Kishi K. Sasaki T. Kuroda S. Itoh T. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). If Rho is inactive in dividing cells, the actomyosin contractile ring at the cleavage furrow does not function properly and cytokinesis is inhibited, resulting in multi-nucleate cells (61Mabuchi I. Hamaguchi Y. Fujimoto H. Morii N. Mishima M. Narumiya S. Zygote. 1993; 1: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 62Kishi K. Sasaki T. Kuroda S. Itoh T. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The ability of carbachol to induce stress fiber formation in multi-nucleate, C3 exoenzyme-treated CHO-m3 cells provides strong evidence that mAChR-mediated stress fiber formation still occurs even when Rho is inactive.Although Rho is apparently not essential for stress fiber formation induced by mAChR activation, Rho may be required for stress fiber formation induced by other agonists. Rho must be active for bombesin or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to induce stress fiber formation in serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells (58Ridley A.J. Hall A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2600-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 63Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). Bombesin- or LPA-dependent stress fiber formation is significantly diminished by 27 μm genistein and is completely abolished by 110 μm genistein, indicating that a tyrosine kinase is required for stress fiber formation induced by these agonists (58Ridley A.J. Hall A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2600-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that genistein concentrations up to 180 μm do not alter mAChR-mediated stress fiber formation (data not shown). These findings indicate that different Rho-mediated signaling pathways leading to stress fiber formation are induced by bombesin or LPA in serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells and by mAChR activation in exponentially proliferating CHO-m3 cells.Rho inactivation diminishes the agonist-induced contraction of smooth muscle (17Lucius C.

We are investigating the possibility that Rho proteins similarly regulate myosin organization in CHO cells by altering MLC phosphorylation, as depicted in Fig. 10. This possibility is supported by studies demonstrating that Rho inactivation diminishes MLC phosphorylation in non-muscle cells (8Majumdar M. Seasholtz T.M. Goldstein D. de Lanerolle P. Brown J.H. J.

These findings are consistent with a report that Rho inactivation does not affect phorbol ester-induced contraction of cerebrovascular smooth muscle but inhibits serotonin-induced contraction of the same tissue (64Akopov S.E. Zhang L. Pearce W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H930-H939PubMed Google Scholar). These results may occur because Rho and PKC participate in separate signaling pathways to regulate myosin organization, as depicted in Fig. 10. According to this model, PKC induces myosin reorganization independently of Rho. This model explains why Rho inactivation does not affect PMA-induced myosin reorganization but diminishes mAChR-mediated myosin reorganization. This model also explains why Rho inactivation does not completely abolish mAChR-mediated stress fiber formation; mAChR-mediated activation of PKC induces myosin reorganization even when Rho is inactive.We found that PKC antagonists completely abolish mAChR-mediated stress fiber formation. This finding indicates that PKC inactivation inhibits both Rho- and PKC-dependent myosin reorganization induced by mAChR stimulation. This result may occur because PKC inactivation inhibits mAChR-mediated signaling to Rho. PKC may act in parallel with sever"

Thrombin exosite interactions with human factor V and its activation products were quantitatively characterized in equilibrium binding studies based on fluorescence changes of thrombin covalently labeled with 2-anilinonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (ANS) linked to the catalytic site histidine residue byN α-[(acetylthio)acetyl]-D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl ([ANS]FPR-thrombin). Exosite I was shown to play a predominant role in the binding of factor V and factor Va from the effect of the exosite I-specific ligand, hirudin54–65, on the interactions. Factor V and factor Va bound to exosite I of [ANS]FPR-thrombin with similar dissociation constants of 3.4 ± 1.3 and 1.1 ± 0.4 μm and fluorescence enhancements of 182 ± 41 and 127 ± 17%, respectively. Native thrombin and labeled thrombin bound with similar affinity to factor Va. Among factor V activation products, the factor Va heavy chain was shown to contain the site of exosite I binding, whereas exosite I-independent, lower affinity interactions were observed for activation fragments E and C1, and no detectable binding was observed for the factor Va light chain. The results support the conclusion that the factor V activation pathway is initiated by exosite I-mediated binding of thrombin to a site in the heavy chain region of factor V that facilitates the initial cleavage at Arg709 to generate the heavy chain of factor Va. The results further suggest that binding of thrombin through exosite I to factor V activation intermediates may regulate their conversion to factor Va and that similar binding of thrombin to the factor Va produced may reflect a mode of interaction involved in the regulation of prothrombin activation. The blood coagulation proteinase, thrombin, converts factor V into factor Va through a multistep activation pathway that is regulated by interactions with thrombin exosites. Thrombin exosite interactions with human factor V and its activation products were quantitatively characterized in equilibrium binding studies based on fluorescence changes of thrombin covalently labeled with 2-anilinonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (ANS) linked to the catalytic site histidine residue byN α-[(acetylthio)acetyl]-D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl ([ANS]FPR-thrombin).

Among factor V activation products, the factor Va heavy chain was shown to contain the site of exosite I binding, whereas exosite I-independent, lower affinity interactions were observed for activation fragments E and C1, and no detectable binding was observed for the factor Va light chain. The results support the conclusion that the factor V activation pathway is initiated by exosite I-mediated binding of thrombin to a site in the heavy chain region of factor V that facilitates the initial cleavage at Arg709 to generate the heavy chain of factor Va. The results further suggest that binding of thrombin through exosite I to factor V activation intermediates may regulate their conversion to factor Va and that similar binding of thrombin to the factor Va produced may reflect a mode of interaction involved in the regulation of prothrombin activation. Blood coagulation factor V is proteolytically processed by thrombin into factor Va through a multistep pathway that is essential for accelerating blood coagulation to the rate required for normal hemostasis (1Dahlbäck B.

Activation of factor V results in an increase in its affinity for factor Xa and prothrombin necessary for efficient assembly on phospholipid membranes of a factor Xa-factor Va-prothrombin catalytic complex that generates thrombin at a ∼300,000-fold faster rate than factor Xa alone (4Suzuki K.

The pathway of factor V activation by thrombin follows a kinetically preferred order of bond cleavage, in which products of cleavage at Arg709 appear first, followed closely by cleavage at Arg1018, and generation of the factor Va light chain by cleavage at Arg1545 as the slowest reaction (4Suzuki K.

The interactions responsible for specific binding of factor V to thrombin as a substrate and the mechanisms that regulate the specificity of the reactions on the activation pathway are not completely understood. Recent studies indicate that exosites I and II on thrombin participate in the mechanism of factor V activation (20Esmon C.T. Lollar P. J. Biol.

Exosites I and II are distinct electropositive sites on thrombin that contribute to the specificity of the enzyme by mediating the binding of certain protein substrates and inhibitors, as well as the binding of macromolecular effectors (23Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 24Stubbs M.T. Bode W. Thromb.

Proteolytic derivatives of thrombin that have lost exosite I function, β- and γ-thrombin, also show decreased activity in factor V activation (22Arocas V. Lemaire C. Bouton M.-C. Bezeaud A. Bon C. Guillin M.-C. Jandrot-Perrus M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The role of exosite II in factor V activation is less clear. Although a decreased rate of bovine factor V activation was observed with an exosite II-disabled thrombin mutant (20Esmon C.T. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13882-13887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the expected inhibitory effects of the exosite II ligands, heparin and prothrombin fragment 2, have not been observed (20Esmon C.T.

Affinity chromatography of factor V activation products on a matrix of thrombin immobilized through its active site was used in previous studies to demonstrate that thrombin binds to factor Va in a previously undescribed, exosite I-dependent interaction with the heavy chain subunit (21Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13143-13152Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This observation may have significance with respect to the function of factor Va in prothrombin activation as well as the mechanism of factor V activation, as suggested by kinetic studies of prethrombin 2 as a substrate analog of prothrombin (25Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 26Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thrombin acts as a competitive inhibitor of bovine prethrombin 2 activation through exosite interactions with the factor Xa-factor Va-membrane complex (25Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 26Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), suggesting that thrombin binding to factor Va could be involved. The roles of thrombin exosite interactions in factor V activation and factor Va activity have been investigated further in the present studies, where the interactions with human factor V, factor Va, the factor Va subunits, and the activation fragments were characterized in quantitative equilibrium binding studies for the first time. The unique properties of a fluorescent thrombin derivative labeled at the catalytic site with 2-anilinonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid as a reporter of exosite I interactions have been used to resolve the role of this regulatory site in binding of factor V/Va species. Exosite I is shown to be principally responsible for binding of factor V to active site-labeled thrombin, with a small contribution from exosite I-independent, lower affinity interactions. Examination of thrombin binding to each of the purified factor V activation products identified only one exosite I-mediated interaction of thrombin with a site on the heavy chain subunit of factor Va as the predominant mode of binding, again with small contributions from lower affinity interactions. These studies support a mechanism of factor V activation in which factor V is recognized as a specific thrombin substrate by exosite I-mediated binding at a site on the heavy chain region of factor V, which enhances specific cleavage at Arg709 to initiate the activation pathway. The observation that factor Va retains the affinity for the exosite I interaction indicates that similar thrombin binding to factor V activation intermediates may regulate other steps in the activation pathway. The finding that thrombin binding to factor Va has similar characteristics to those described previously for prothrombin binding to bovine factor Va (15Guinto E.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

Human α-thrombin was purified as described previously (28Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14963-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or obtained from Dr. John Fenton (New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY). Preparations of thrombin were >95% active by active site titration with p-nitrophenyl p-guanidinobenzoate under the conditions used previously (28Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14963-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with the protein concentrations determined from the 280 nm absorbance with an absorption coefficient of 1.74 (mg/ml)−1 cm−1 and molecular weight of 36,600 (29Fenton II, J.W.

Active site-labeled thrombin ([2-anilinonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid]FPR-thrombin ([ANS]FPR-thrombin)) was prepared by inactivation of 46 μm α-thrombin with a 2.5-fold excess ofN α-[(acetylthio)acetyl]-FPR-CH2Cl and labeling of the NH2OH-generated thiol group on the incorporated inhibitor with a 5–6-fold excess of 2-((4′-iodoacetamido)anilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid at 38 μm enzyme following procedures described previously (28Bock P.E.

Factor V was purified from normal human plasma and activated by incubation at 2–6 mg/ml with 50 nm thrombin in 50 mm Hepes, 0.11 m NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4, for 40 min at 37 °C as described previously (21Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13143-13152Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The thrombin was inactivated by incubation for 15 min at room temperature with 1 μmFPR-CH2Cl, and the factor Va was stored at −70 °C. Factor V activation products were isolated from thrombin-activated factor V by chromatography on (2-mercaptoethanol)-(3,3′-iminobispropylamine)-agarose and on thrombin immobilized onto iodoacetyl-(3,3′-iminobispropylamine)-agarose through its active site withNα-[(acetylthio)acetyl]-FPR-CH2Cl, following the methods developed previously (21Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13143-13152Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, fragment C1 was separated from factor Va and fragment E by chromatography of thrombin-activated factor V on (2-mercaptoethanol)-(3,3′-iminobispropylamine)-agarose and further purified by passage through a 5-ml column of S-Sepharose in 25 mm Hepes, 50 mm NH4Cl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 6.5, at 4 °C. Following removal of fragment C1, fragment E and the two-subunit form of factor Va (Va-hl) were separated on the immobilized thrombin matrix in buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2. The factor Va heavy chain (Va-h) and light chain (Va-l) subunits were isolated by chromatography of EDTA-dissociated Va-hl on the thrombin matrix in buffer containing 1 mm EDTA. Proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration with YM 30 membranes and dialyzed against the buffer used for the experiments. Polyethylene glycol 8000 was omitted from the buffers used for elution of the factor Va species to prevent its co-concentration during ultrafiltration. Proteins were characterized by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 4–15% gradient gels stained with Coomassie Blue or periodic acid-Schiff reagent. Concentrations of factor V/Va species were determined from the 280 nm absorbance using the following absorption coefficients ((mg/ml)−1 cm−1) and molecular weights: factor V and thrombin activated-factor V, 0.89 and 330,000 (2Kane W.H. Majerus P.W. J. Biol.

With the exception of the value for factor V, the absorption coefficients were calculated from the amino acid compositions (7Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M.

Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Nonsulfated hirudin54–65 (Sigma or Bachem) was dissolved in water, and its concentration was determined from the tyrosine absorbance at 293 nm in 0.1 m NaOH with an absorption coefficient of 2381 m−1 cm−1(33Mihalyi E. J. Chem. Eng. Data. 1968; 13: 179-182Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in 50 mm Hepes, 0.11 m NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4, and at 25 °C. FPR-CH2Cl (1 μm) was added to the buffer for all titrations except those containing native thrombin. Fluorescence measurements were made with an SLM 8100 fluorometer in the ratio mode. Acrylic cuvettes were coated with polyethylene glycol 20,000 to minimize protein adsorption (34Latallo Z.S. Hall J.A. Thromb. Res. 1986; 43: 507-521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) for measurements of ANS fluorescence, and uncoated cuvettes were used for tryptophan fluorescence. Binding of Hir54–65 to thrombin was measured from the changes in tryptophan fluorescence with 295 nm excitation (4 or 8 nm band pass) and 360 nm emission (8 nm band pass). Titrations were done by measuring the fluorescence after successive additions of small volumes of titrant. The observed fluorescence was corrected for dilution (≤13%) and for background by subtraction of measurements on solutions lacking the fluorescent species. Fluorescence data were expressed as the fractional change in the initial fluorescence (ΔF/F o =(F obs −Fo)/F o). Titrations of thrombin with Hir54–65 were fit by the quadratic equilibrium binding equation to obtain the maximum fluorescence change (ΔF max /F o) and dissociation constant (K Hir), assuming one binding site for Hir54–65 on thrombin. Binding of factor V/Va species to [ANS]FPR-thrombin was measured from changes in ANS fluorescence emission at 450 nm with excitation at 325 nm and using 8 nm band passes. Fixed concentrations of [ANS]FPR-thrombin were titrated with factor V/Va species in the absence of Hir54–65 and in the presence of a fixed, near-saturating Hir54–65 concentration. Mixtures of [ANS]FPR-thrombin and a fixed level of factor V/Va species were also titrated with Hir54–65 under the same conditions. The relatively high protein concentrations required for the titrations necessitated corrections for dilution of ≤ 35%. Dilution of [ANS]FPR-thrombin was included in analysis of the results. However, such corrections had little effect because the concentration of labeled thrombin was below the dissociation constants for the interactions. Corrections of the ANS fluorescence data for background were typically ≤13%, with the exception of the lowest fluorescence enhancement in the fragment C1 titrations (≤20%) and in the native thrombin competition experiments at the highest protein concentrations (≤27%). Binding of factor V/Va species to [ANS]FPR-thrombin and the effect of Hir54–65 were analyzed as a special case of the general situation in which two ligands bind competitively to a fluorescent protein probe and the interactions are accompanied by unequal fluorescence changes. In this model, ligands L and C bind mutually exclusively to n equivalent and independent sites on the probe (P) with dissociation constants K L andK C and maximum fluorescence changes relative to the fluorescence of the probe of ΔF max L /F o and ΔF max C /F o (Scheme I).P+nL⇄ΔFmax L/FoKLPLn+nCKC⇵ΔFmax C/FoPCnSCHEMEIThe observed fluorescence change is given by the sum of the contributions from the two probe complexes, weighted by the maximum fluorescence changes associated with their formation (35Hogg P.J.

However, this assumption is not always justified, and typically only the total concentrations are known in spectroscopic studies. The free concentrations of L and C can be expressed in terms of the total concentrations and the concentration of PL as shown in Equations 4 and 5.[L]=[L]o−[PL]Equation 4 [C]=[C]o−n[P]o+[PL](1+KL[L]o−[PL])Equation 5 Substitution of these expressions into Equation 2 and rearranging gives the cubic Equations Equation 6, Equation 7, Equation 8, Equation 9, Equation 10 for [PL]/n[P]o in terms of the total ligand and probe concentrations, the dissociation constants, and the stoichiometric factor.

The observed fluorescence change as a function of the total concentrations of the ligands and the constants is given by Equation 1, with [PL]/n[P]o and [PC]/n[P]o obtained from the solutions of the two cubic equations. Alternatively, solution of Equations Equation 6, Equation 7, Equation 8, Equation 9, Equation 10 for [PL]/n[P]o allows [PC]/n[P]o to be more easily calculated from Equation 11, which is obtained from the mass conservation equation for P and the definition of the equilibrium constant.[PC]n[P]o=1−([PL]n[P]o)−KL([PL]n[P]o)[L]o−n[P]o([PL]n[P]o)Equation 11 For the present case, P was [ANS]FPR-thrombin, L was factor V, Va or Va subunit, and C was Hir54–65. The fluorescence change accompanying Hir54–65 binding to [ANS]FPR-thrombin did not contribute directly to the observed fluorescence change because the maximum fluorescence increase was ≤3% of the change accompanying factor V/Va binding. This allowed the second term of Equation 1 to be set to zero. In the factor V/Va experiments, there was also an exosite I-independent increase in fluorescence that was a linear function of factor V/Va concentration. This was included in the binding model as a term linear in factor V/Va concentration, representing weak interactions of factor V/Va species with labeled thrombin. Simplification of Equation 1 for the present studies and incorporating the exosite I-independent fluorescence change gave Equation 12, where ANS-T represents [ANS]FPR-thrombin and V represents the factor V/Va species.ΔFFo=([ANS­T·V]n[ANS­T]o)ΔFmaxFo+ΔFexo­indoFo[V]oEquation 12 Fluorescence changes were measured in titrations of [ANS]FPR-thrombin as a function of the total concentration of factor V/Va species in the absence of Hir54–65 and at near-saturating concentrations of Hir54–65, and as a function of Hir54–65 concentration at fixed concentrations of factor V/Va species.

The fitted parameters were the dissociation constant for factor V/Va binding to [ANS]FPR-thrombin (K V/Va), the maximum fluorescence change for this interaction, the dissociation constant for Hir54–65 binding, and the slope of the exosite I-independent fluorescence increase (ΔF exo-ind /F o (where “exo-ind” indicates “exosite I-independent”)), with a value of 1 assumed for the stoichiometric factor. The effect of native thrombin on binding of factor Va to [ANS]FPR-thrombin was measured in titrations of [ANS]FPR-thrombin with factor Va in the absence and presence of fixed concentrations of native thrombin and in the absence and presence of near-saturating concentrations of Hir54–65. The results were analyzed by nonlinear least squares fitting of all of the titration data with Equation 12. For this case, which differs from the situation described above, the cubic equation described previously (38Olson S.T. Bock P.E. Sheffer R. Arch. Biochem.

The dissociation constants for factor Va binding to [ANS]FPR-thrombin and to native thrombin, the maximum fluorescence change, and the slope of the exosite I-independent fluorescence change were the fitted parameters. Least squares fitting and simulation were performed with Dnrp53, Dnrpeasy (36Duggleby R.G. Comput. Biol. Med. 1984; 14: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 37Duggleby R.G.

Binding of thrombin to factor V and its activation products was characterized quantitatively from fluorescence changes of thrombin that was specifically labeled with ANS covalently linked to the catalytic site histidine residue throughNα-[(acetylthio)acetyl]-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (28Bock P.E.

https://openalex.org/W2061775322,"Toc34 is a member of the outer membrane translocon complex that mediates the initial stage of protein import into chloroplasts. Toc34, like most outer membrane proteins, is synthesized in the cytosol at its mature size without a cleavable transit peptide. The majority of outer membrane proteins do not require thermolysin-sensitive components on the chloroplastic surface or ATP for their insertion into the outer membrane. However, different results have been obtained concerning the factors required for Toc34 insertion into the outer membrane. Using an Arabidopsis homologue of pea Toc34, atToc34, we show that the insertion of atToc34 was greatly reduced by thermolysin pretreatment of chloroplasts as assayed either by protease digestion or by alkaline extraction. The insertion was also dependent on the presence of ATP or GTP. A mutant of atToc34 with the GTP-binding domain deleted still required ATP for optimal insertion, indicating that ATP was used by other protein components in the import system. The ATP-supported insertion was observed even in thermolysin-pretreated chloroplasts, suggesting that the protein component responsible for ATP-stimulated insertion is a different protein from the thermolysin-sensitive component that assists atToc34 insertion.

Most proteins in chloroplasts are encoded by nuclear genes and post-translationally imported from the cytosol. There appear to be at least two classes of nucleus-encoded chloroplastic proteins, distinguished by the presence or absence of cleavable targeting signals. The first class of proteins are synthesized in the cytosol as higher molecular weight precursor proteins with N-terminal extensions called transit peptides. This class of proteins consists of proteins targeted to the interior of chloroplasts (the inner envelope membrane, the stroma, the thylakoid membrane, and the thylakoid lumen) and two outer membrane proteins (1Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 2Schnell D.J. Kessler F. Blobel G.

Transit peptides are necessary and sufficient for the import of these precursor proteins into chloroplasts. The import process is initiated by a binding step that involves specific interaction between the transit peptide and a thermolysin-sensitive protein complex on the chloroplastic surface, followed by translocation of the precursor protein across the envelope. The binding step requires ATP in the 100 μm range, and translocation across the envelope requires about 1 mm ATP (5Olsen L.J. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 433-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several envelope proteins that are associated with precursor proteins in the binding step have been identified (6Fuks B. Schnell D.J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Kouranov A. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1677-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These proteins are likely to be components of the machinery responsible for the import of precursor proteins into chloroplasts (8Jarvis P. Chen L.-J. Li H. Peto C.A. Fankhauser C. Chory J.

These proteins are collectively named Toc 1The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; CAB, the chlorophylla/b-binding protein of photosystem II.1The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; CAB, the chlorophylla/b-binding protein of photosystem II.

This class of proteins includes most chloroplastic outer membrane proteins. Much less is known about the import mechanism of these outer membrane proteins. Most studies indicate that their insertion into the outer membrane does not require ATP or any thermolysin-sensitive proteins on the chloroplastic surface (10Fischer K. Weber A. Arbinger B. Brink S. Eckerskorn C. Flugge U.-I. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Li H.-M. Moore T. Keegstra K.

Chem. 1992; 267: 2986-2993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One exception to this rule is the outer membrane protein Toc34.Toc34 was identified as a member of the translocon complex at the outer membrane (1Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 14Seedorf M. Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1995; 7: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It is a GTP-binding protein and contains an outer membrane-targeting/insertion signal located at the C terminus of the protein (14Seedorf M. Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1995; 7: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 15Chen D. Schnell D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10968-10974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Using the appearance of a protease-resistant fragment corresponding to the C-terminal membrane anchor to assess insertion, one research group reported that insertion of Toc34 into the outer membrane is sensitive to thermolysin pretreatment of chloroplasts and also reduced by glucose/hexokinase treatment to remove ATP (14Seedorf M. Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1995; 7: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the ATP is used by Toc34 itself or by other ATP-requiring protein components in the import system. In contrast, using resistance to alkaline extraction to assess insertion, a second group showed that ATP removal by apyrase or thermolysin pretreatment of chloroplasts has no effect on the insertion of Toc34 into the outer membrane (1Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, the second group later showed that Toc34 insertion is indeed stimulated by ATP or GTP, but the NTP is most likely bound only by Toc34 itself to acquire an insertion-competent conformation (15Chen D. Schnell D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6614-6620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Because Toc34 is a member of the translocon for protein import into chloroplasts, a clear understanding of the mechanism used for its insertion into the outer membrane will shed light on the question of how components in the translocon are transported to chloroplasts themselves. We have therefore made a more detailed analysis of the import characteristics of Toc34. We investigated Toc34 import kinetics and developed a new and cleaner method of removing NTP from the import system. We then assayed the insertion of Toc34 both by protease treatment and by alkaline extraction. We further investigated the NTP requirement using a mutant form of Toc34 that no longer binds NTP. Our results indicate that insertion of Toc34 into the chloroplastic outer membrane is assisted by at least one thermolysin-sensitive chloroplastic protein and one ATP-utilizing protein in the import system.DISCUSSIONWe have tried to resolve the ambiguities of, and have also carried out further analysis on, the insertion mechanism of Toc34 into the chloroplastic outer membrane. Using an Arabidopsis homologue of pea Toc34, our results suggest that insertion of atToc34 is assisted by at least two proteinaceous components in the import system: one being thermolysin-sensitive and one requiring ATP for its function. Our previous results have also shown that the targeting signal of atToc34, when fused in front of a passenger protein, can translocate a passenger protein of 26 kDa across the chloroplastic outer membrane (16Li H.-M. Chen L.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10968-10974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This result also suggests a mechanism of protein-assisted insertion rather than an insertion mechanism based solely on direct interactions with membrane lipids.We have assayed atToc34 insertion both by alkaline extraction and by thermolysin digestion. We showed that insertion of atToc34 is indeed reduced by thermolysin pretreatment of chloroplasts. It is not clear why conflicting results were reported concerning this issue (1Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 14Seedorf M. Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1995; 7: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,15Chen D. Schnell D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6614-6620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is possible that differences in the protease treatment conditions may cause different levels of reduction in import. We have therefore used the import of CAB, which is one of the first proteins used to demonstrate the thermolysin sensitivity of chloroplast protein import, as a control for the effectiveness of our thermolysin treatment. We showed that under conditions when the import of CAB was reduced, the association and insertion of atToc34 was also reduced. These conditions may be harsher than conditions used by other investigators. Furthermore, it may be important to inspect the effect in the linear range of import, before import reaches a plateau, so that any reduction can be more readily detected.We have reinvestigated the NTP requirement for atToc34 import by using an NTP removal system that can fully hydrolyze all NTP to NMP. Our results are consistent with previous findings that insertion of Toc34 is stimulated by ATP and GTP (14Seedorf M. Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1995; 7: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 15Chen D. Schnell D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6614-6620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). GTP is most likely used by Toc34 itself to acquire an import-competent conformation (15Chen D. Schnell D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6614-6620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Our data further extend these results by showing that Toc34 was not the only protein in the import system that required NTP. An atToc34 mutant with the GTP-binding domain deleted still required ATP for insertion, indicating that some other component in the system also required ATP. We propose that, in import reactions with full-length atToc34, the small amount of ATP remaining on the surface of chloroplasts after dark depletion was enough to support atToc34 insertion when only GTP was added. The stimulation we observed after adding GTP was mostly due to atToc34 itself changing to an import-competent conformation after binding GTP. The ATP requirement was made more evident when using a substrate that does not bind GTP (ΔN206) and pretreating the chloroplasts with apyrase in addition to dark incubation. We have no data to indicate where the ATP-utilizing component may reside. It could be an ATP-binding protein at the chloroplastic envelope, or it could be a chaperone protein in the in vitro translation system we used to prepare the import substrates. However, it has been shown thatE. coli overexpressed and purified Toc34 is fully competent in inserting into the outer membrane (15Chen D. Schnell D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6614-6620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We also have data indicating that either pea leaf soluble extracts or wheat germ extracts could not increase the insertion efficiency of purified atToc34 even in NaCl and EDTA-prewashed chloroplasts (data not shown). Therefore, at least in the in vitro import system, a cytosolic chaperone protein may not be a necessary component for Toc34 import.The ATP-requiring component that assists atToc34 insertion was present even after thermolysin pretreatment of chloroplasts. This result suggests that the ATP-requiring component is a different protein from the thermolysin-sensitive component that is also required for atToc34 insertion. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that they are two domains of the same protein. Further investigations are necessary to reveal the identity of these components and the mechanism used to target Toc34 to the chloroplast outer membrane.There are four integral chloroplastic outer membrane proteins identified so far that do not contain cleavable transit peptides (1Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar,10Fischer K. Weber A. Arbinger B. Brink S. Eckerskorn C. Flugge U.-I. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Li H.-M. Moore T. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Salomon M. Fischer K.

Plant J. 1995; 7: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Among them, the import of OEP14 and OEP6.7 is resistant to thermolysin pretreatment of chloroplasts and also does not require ATP (11Li H.-M. Moore T. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Salomon M. Fischer K. Flugge U.-I. Soll J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5778-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The import of OEP24, on the other hand, is resistant to thermolysin pretreatment of chloroplasts, but its insertion into the outer membrane is stimulated by ATP (10Fischer K. Weber A. Arbinger B. Brink S. Eckerskorn C. Flugge U.-I. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the import of Toc34 is sensitive to thermolysin pretreatment of chloroplasts and also requires ATP. These features seems to make the import of Toc34 more similar to the import of precursor proteins into the interior of chloroplasts. However, the location and composition of the outer membrane targeting signal of Toc34 (a C-terminal hydrophobic sequence) makes it unlikely that Toc34 uses the Tic/Toc translocon used by precursor proteins imported into the interior of chloroplasts. It has also been mentioned that import of Toc34 was not competed by excess amounts of a precursor protein imported through the Tic/Toc translocon (14Seedorf M. Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1995; 7: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It therefore seems there are several different pathways for protein import into chloroplasts. However, it is still possible that these different import characteristics we observed among different groups of proteins represent small branches in the same pathway. For example, each group of proteins may have some unique translocon components that they use in their import pathway, and these different import pathways may converge at various points in the import process. Most proteins in chloroplasts are encoded by nuclear genes and post-translationally imported from the cytosol. There appear to be at least two classes of nucleus-encoded chloroplastic proteins, distinguished by the presence or absence of cleavable targeting signals.

Our results are consistent with previous findings that insertion of Toc34 is stimulated by ATP and GTP (14Seedorf M. Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1995; 7: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 15Chen D. Schnell D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6614-6620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). GTP is most likely used by Toc34 itself to acquire an import-competent conformation (15Chen D. Schnell D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6614-6620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Our data further extend these results by showing that Toc34 was not the only protein in the import system that required NTP. An atToc34 mutant with the GTP-binding domain deleted still required ATP for insertion, indicating that some other component in the system also required ATP. We propose that, in import reactions with full-length atToc34, the small amount of ATP remaining on the surface of chloroplasts after dark depletion was enough to support atToc34 insertion when only GTP was added. The stimulation we observed after adding GTP was mostly due to atToc34 itself changing to an import-competent conformation after binding GTP. The ATP requirement was made more evident when using a substrate that does not bind GTP (ΔN206) and pretreating the chloroplasts with apyrase in addition to dark incubation. We have no data to indicate where the ATP-utilizing component may reside. It could be an ATP-binding protein at the chloroplastic envelope, or it could be a chaperone protein in the in vitro translation system we used to prepare the import substrates. However, it has been shown thatE. coli overexpressed and purified Toc34 is fully competent in inserting into the outer membrane (15Chen D. Schnell D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6614-6620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We also have data indicating that either pea leaf soluble extracts or wheat germ extracts could not increase the insertion efficiency of purified atToc34 even in NaCl and EDTA-prewashed chloroplasts (data not shown). Therefore, at least in the in vitro import system, a cytosolic chaperone protein may not be a necessary component for Toc34 import.The ATP-requiring component that assists atToc34 insertion was present even after thermolysin pretreatment of chloroplasts. This result suggests that the ATP-requiring component is a different protein from the thermolysin-sensitive component that is also required for atToc34 insertion. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that they are two domains of the same protein. Further investigations are necessary to reveal the identity of these components and the mechanism used to target Toc34 to the chloroplast outer membrane.There are four integral chloroplastic outer membrane proteins identified so far that do not contain cleavable transit peptides (1Kessler F.

Plant J. 1995; 7: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Among them, the import of OEP14 and OEP6.7 is resistant to thermolysin pretreatment of chloroplasts and also does not require ATP (11Li H.-M. Moore T. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Salomon M. Fischer K. Flugge U.-I. Soll J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5778-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The import of OEP24, on the other hand, is resistant to thermolysin pretreatment of chloroplasts, but its insertion into the outer membrane is stimulated by ATP (10Fischer K. Weber A. Arbinger B. Brink S. Eckerskorn C. Flugge U.-I. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the import of Toc34 is sensitive to thermolysin pretreatment of chloroplasts and also requires ATP. These features seems to make the import of Toc34 more similar to the import of precursor proteins into the interior of chloroplasts. However, the location and composition of the outer membrane targeting signal of Toc34 (a C-terminal hydrophobic sequence) makes it unlikely that Toc34 uses the Tic/Toc translocon used by precursor proteins imported into the interior of chloroplasts. It has also been mentioned that import of Toc34 was not competed by excess amounts of a precursor protein imported through the Tic/Toc translocon (14Seedorf M. Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1995; 7: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It therefore seems there are several different pathways for protein import into chloroplasts. However, it is still possible that these different import characteristics we observed among different groups of proteins represent small branches in the same pathway. For example, each group of proteins may have some unique translocon components that they use in their import pathway, and these different import pathways may converge at various points in the import process. We have tried to resolve the ambiguities of, and have also carried out further analysis on, the insertion mechanism of Toc34 into the chloroplastic outer membrane. Using an Arabidopsis homologue of pea Toc34, our results suggest that insertion of atToc34 is assisted by at least two proteinaceous components in the import system: one being thermolysin-sensitive and one requiring ATP for its function. Our previous results have also shown that the targeting signal of atToc34, when fused in front of a passenger protein, can translocate a passenger protein of 26 kDa across the chloroplastic outer membrane (16Li H.-M. Chen L.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10968-10974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This result also suggests a mechanism of protein-assisted insertion rather than an insertion mechanism based solely on direct interactions with membrane lipids. We have assayed atToc34 insertion both by alkaline extraction and by thermolysin digestion. We showed that insertion of atToc34 is indeed reduced by thermolysin pretreatment of chloroplasts. It is not clear why conflicting results were reported concerning this issue (1Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 14Seedorf M. Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1995; 7: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,15Chen D. Schnell D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6614-6620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is possible that differences in the protease treatment conditions may cause different levels of reduction in import. We have therefore used the import of CAB, which is one of the first proteins used to demonstrate the thermolysin sensitivity of chloroplast protein import, as a control for the effectiveness of our thermolysin treatment. We showed that under conditions when the import of CAB was reduced, the association and insertion of atToc34 was also reduced. These conditions may be harsher than conditions used by other investigators. Furthermore, it may be important to inspect the effect in the linear range of import, before import reaches a plateau, so that any reduction can be more readily detected.

https://openalex.org/W2071946811,"The ability of proteins of the Bcl-2 family to either induce or inhibit apoptosis is dependent on both cell type and the apoptotic stimulus. We have shown in the murine pro-B cell line FL5.12 that Bcl-2 is incapable of inhibiting tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-induced cell death and is cleaved during this process. One potential explanation for this observation is that caspase activation directly or indirectly inhibits Bcl-2 function. It has been suggested that caspase cleavage of Bcl-2 is responsible for its inability to block certain cell deaths. Consistent with Bcl-2 cleavage being a caspase-mediated event, this cleavage is inhibitable by 50 μm CBZ-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk). Furthermore, Bcl-2 can cooperate with the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk in a dose-dependent manner to block TNFα-induced cell death. Overexpression of Bcl-2 results in a 10-fold decrease in the amount of zVAD-fmk required to inhibit TNFα-induced apoptosis. However, cleavage-defective mutants (D31A and D34A) show no enhanced viability relative to wild-type Bcl-2 in response to TNFα-induced cell death and also show the same cooperativity with zVAD-fmk. These results suggest that Bcl-2 cleavage is not important for the inhibition of TNFα-induced cell death but do not preclude an involvement in a post-commitment phase of apoptosis.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an essential mechanism involved in development and homeostasis. Apoptotic signals can be induced by various stimuli, such as DNA damage, anticancer drugs, growth factor withdrawal, and members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) 1The abbreviations used are: TNFR, tumor necrosis factor-α receptor; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; CHX, cycloheximide; zVAD-fmk, CBZ-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone; IL, interleukin; HA, hemagglutinin; PI, propidium iodide; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. family of death receptors (reviewed in Refs. 1Thompson C.B.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) is a pleiotropic cytokine that is primarily involved in inflammatory responses; however, it has also been shown to have the ability to induce cell death through one of the two isoforms of its receptor, p55 TNFR1 (3Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). In some cells, however, the addition of TNFα is not sufficient to trigger cell death unless protein synthesis is also inhibited by the addition of cycloheximide. This implies thatde novo synthesis of survival genes may be regulated through TNFR1 signaling (4Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M.

Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). TNFR1 has no intrinsic intracellular signaling domains, so signaling is carried out by adapter molecules that recruit effector proteins to the receptor complex. The adapter protein TNF receptor-associated death domain protein binds directly to TNFR1 through a conserved motif referred to as the death domain contained in each molecule and also to either the adapter protein Fas-associated death domain protein or a member of the TNFR-associated factor family (primarily TNFR-associated factor 2) (3Ashkenazi A.

Fas-associated death domain protein has an additional domain that is required for cell death termed the death effector domain, which binds to the homologous domain in the protein pro-caspase-8 (FLICE/MACH1) (11Muzio M.

Caspases are cysteine proteases that cleave after aspartic acid residues (reviewed in Refs. 13Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar, 14Miller D.K. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 15Cryns V. Yuan J.

All caspases are produced as inactive proenzymes and must be activated through cleavage to release their active subunits. It is believed that the binding of TNFα to TNFR1 causes receptor trimerization and that this allows three caspase-8 proenzymes to transactivate each other and induce a caspase cascade leading to cell death. This caspase cascade can occur via two mechanisms. In some cells, caspase-8 can directly activate caspase-3, whereas in others, caspase-8 signaling induces cytochrome crelease from the mitochondria (17Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). Once released from the intermembrane space, cytochrome c participates with theced-4 homologue Apaf-1 in the activation of caspase-9 (18Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.

Caspase-9 can then continue the cascade by activating downstream caspases, such as caspase-3 or caspase-7. The anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family function at the stage of cytochromec release and caspase-9 activation (reviewed in Refs.21Reed J.C. Zha H. Aime-Sempe C. Takayama S. Wang H.-G.

Bcl-2 family members can localize to outer membranes of the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and nucleus (25Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar, 26Akao Y. Otsuki Y. Kataoka S. Ito Y. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2468-2471PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that Bcl-xL can sequester pro-caspase-9 at the mitochondria by forming a trimolecular complex with the humanced-4 homologue Apaf-1 and pro-caspase-9 (27Pan G. O'Rourke K. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5841-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 has also been shown to block the release of the apoptotic co-factor cytochrome c (28Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar, 29Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D.

Also, Caspase-9−/− embryonic fibroblasts are resistant to UV and γ-irradiation, but thymocytes are sensitive to UV irradiation and Fas-induced cell death (31Hakem R. Hakem A. Duncan G.S. Henderson J.T. Woo M. Soengas M.S. Elia A. de la Pompa J.L. Kagi D. Khoo W. Potter J. Yoshida R. Kaufman S.A. Lowe S.W. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 339-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). These results imply that whereas caspase-9 is important in some cell deaths, other cell deaths can occur in its absence. It is therefore believed that there may be multiple pathways involved in cell death and that these pathways are either dependent or independent of mitochondrial events. It is also unclear how Bcl-2 activity is regulated. It has been suggested that caspases are capable of directly cleaving Bcl-2 and that this may be responsible, at least in part, for the inability of Bcl-2 to block IL-3 withdrawal- and Fas-induced cell death (32Cheng E.H.-Y. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that phosphorylation of Bcl-2 in the 60-amino acid loop domain is an important negative regulatory mechanism for Bcl-2 function (33Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). We have shown that Bcl-2 overexpression can block cell death induced by IL-3 withdrawal in the murine pro-B cell line FL5.12 but is unable to block cell death induced by TNFα in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. One difference that we have observed is that Bcl-2 is cleaved directly in response to TNFα, but not in response to IL-3 withdrawal. This cleavage can be blocked by the addition of the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, suggesting that this cleavage is a caspase-mediated event. Moreover, addition of zVAD-fmk (50 μm) could also block TNFα-induced apoptosis in Bcl-2-transfected cells, but not in vector control-transfected cells. Surprisingly, cells that overexpress Bcl-2 require a 10-fold lower concentration of zVAD-fmk to block TNFα-induced cell death. This result implies that there is cooperativity between Bcl-2 overexpression and caspase inhibition. One possible explanation of these results is that zVAD-fmk blocks caspase-mediated cleavage of Bcl-2 so that Bcl-2 can exert its anti-apoptotic effects. However, cleavage-defective Bcl-2 mutants had no effect on viability in response to TNFα. Moreover, these cleavage-defective mutants maintained the same level of cooperativity with zVAD-fmk. Our results demonstrate that direct cleavage of Bcl-2 by caspases does not play a role in all cell deaths and imply that cleavage may be a late event in death receptor-mediated cell death. The murine pro-B cell line FL5.12 was grown at 37 °C in 5% carbon dioxide in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 mm HEPES, Wehi-3B supernatant (a source of IL-3), penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine and in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 for transfected cells. All cell culture materials were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Cell transfections were carried out as described previously (33Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 107 cells were spun for 5 min at 1100 rpm and resuspended in 0.4 ml of FL5.12 medium in an electroporation cuvette. Generally, 15 μg of DNA were used per transfection, and electroporation was carried out at 250 V and 960 microfarads as described. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and transferred to 10 ml of medium. After a 48-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were added to medium containing G418 to select for neomycin resistance. The untagged Bcl-2 construct in the pSFFV-Neo vector (Bcl-2) and a hemagglutinin-tagged full-length Bcl-2 construct in pSFFV-Neo (HA-Bcl-2) have been described previously (33Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The HA-Bcl-2 construct was used for site-directed mutagenesis using the Chameleon double-stranded DNA mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The following mutagenesis primers were used to generate Bcl-2 cleavage-defective mutants D31A and D34A: 5′-PAGAGGGGCTACGAGT GGGCTGCGGGAGATGTGGGCG-3′, D31A; and 5′-PTACGAGTGGGATGCGGGAGCTGTGGGCGCCGCGC-3′, D34A. Bcl-2 mutants were verified by sequencing and by Western blot analysis (see below). For TNFα-induced cell death assays, cells were counted, spun at 1100 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml. Recombinant human TNFα (2 ng/ml; Calbiochem) and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) (10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline; Sigma) were added for 6 h to induce cell death. To determine the dose response and time course required for TNFα-induced apoptosis to occur, cells were either incubated as described in the presence of 0–5 ng/ml TNFα and 10 μg/ml CHX (kept constant) for 6 h or incubated in the presence of 2 ng/ml TNFα and 10 μg/ml CHX for 0–9 h. In some experiments, the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, CA) was added at the indicated concentrations. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h and analyzed for cell viability on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) by propidium iodide (PI; Sigma) and annexin V-FITC (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) staining. IL-3 withdrawal assays were carried out in a similar fashion. Cells were harvested, washed three times with RPMI 1640 medium, and resuspended at a final concentration of 5 × 105cells/ml in medium lacking IL-3. At the indicated time points, cell viability was ascertained by PI staining as described previously (33Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Cells from TNFα or IL-3 withdrawal cell death experiments were harvested, washed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitors (170 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce). Samples were boiled for 5 min and loaded onto a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. Generally, 50 μg of total protein were loaded per lane. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose by standard methods (33Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used to detect full-length Bcl-2 and cleavage products: (a) a hamster anti-human Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody (6C8; PharMingen), (b) a mouse anti-hamster immunoglobulin mixture (PharMingen), and (c) a goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin linked to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We have shown that the murine pro-B cell line FL5.12 can be triggered to undergo programmed cell death in response to TNFα in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX. As shown in Fig.1 A, FL5.12 cells transfected with a vector control (Neo) were 33 ± 19.1% viable as determined by PI and annexin V-FITC staining after a 6-h incubation with 2 ng/ml TNFα and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. When FL5.12 cells overexpressing either Bcl-2 or HA-Bcl-2 are incubated with TNFα and CHX, there is no effect on viability (viability for Bcl-2 was 35.4 ± 10.9%; viability for HA-Bcl-2 was 35.5 ± 13.9%). The fact that Bcl-2 and HA-Bcl-2 cells die to the same extent implies that the addition of the HA tag to wild-type Bcl-2 does not confer any selective advantages for cell survival. The inability of Bcl-2 or HA-Bcl-2 to block TNFα-induced apoptosis was intrinsic to the signal and not the cell because these molecules were sufficient to block IL-3 withdrawal-induced cell death in the same cells (Fig.1 B). To further characterize the inability of Bcl-2 to inhibit TNFα-induced apoptosis, dose-response (Fig. 1 C) and time course (Fig. 1 D) experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 1 C, Bcl-2 overexpression was unable to block TNFα-induced apoptosis at all doses of TNFα between 0.5 and 5 ng/ml in the presence of a constant concentration of CHX (10 μg/ml) after a 6-h incubation period. There was virtually no increase in apoptosis between the 2 and 5 ng/ml doses of TNFα, thus we chose the concentration of 2 ng/ml TNFα for subsequent experiments. Fig.1 D shows a time course of TNFα-induced apoptosis in control- and Bcl-2-transfected cells. Importantly, cycloheximide at the concentration used throughout these experiments did not induce apoptosis (closed symbols) and only began to display toxic effects after 24 h (data not shown). As indicated in the figure, a very limited amount of apoptosis occurs in these cells after 3 h, but by 6 h there is a dramatic increase in the number of apoptotic cells. There is little difference between the amount of apoptosis observed at 6 and 9 h, thus we chose 6-h treatments for subsequent experiments. One possible explanation of why Bcl-2 does not inhibit TNFα-induced apoptosis in FL5.12 cells is that it is inactivated by upstream caspases activated during death receptor signaling. This inactivation could occur through cleavage of Bcl-2 or activation of kinases and subsequent phosphorylation of Bcl-2. Therefore, we determined if Bcl-2 was cleaved in response to TNF receptor ligation. As shown in Fig. 2 A, Bcl-2 can be cleaved in response to TNFα at 6 h post-treatment. It has recently been shown that Bcl-2 can be cleaved after amino acid 34, and this is consistent with the 21-kDa C-terminal cleavage product that was detected in response to TNFα treatment. Cleavage of Bcl-2 was tested after IL-3 withdrawal but was not detected in Bcl-2-transfected cells up to 4 days after growth factor withdrawal (Fig. 2 B). To determine whether the cleavage of Bcl-2 in response to TNFα was a direct caspase-mediated event, we tested for Bcl-2 cleavage in response to TNFα in the presence or absence of 50 μm zVAD-fmk. As shown in Fig.3, Bcl-2 is cleaved in response to TNFα as early as 6 h post-treatment, with an increase in the level of the indicated cleavage product occurring between 6 and 24 h. As expected, the addition of the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk efficiently blocked Bcl-2 cleavage in response to TNFα. This result suggests that the cleavage of Bcl-2 in response to TNFα is a direct caspase-mediated event. Because Bcl-2 cleavage was blocked by zVAD-fmk, we wished to determine the effects of the addition of this inhibitor to Bcl-2- and vector control-transfected cells on TNFα-induced apoptosis. Whereas zVAD-fmk (50 μm) did not lead to enhanced viability of control-transfected cells in response to TNFα, the addition of the same concentration of zVAD-fmk to cells overexpressing Bcl-2 restored viability to untreated levels (Fig.4 A). Importantly, whereas this concentration of zVAD-fmk was unable to block TNFα-induced apoptosis in control cells, this was not due to an inability of the caspase inhibitor to enter these cells, because caspase-3 activation was efficiently blocked in these cells. 2B. W. Johnson and L. H. Boise, unpublished observation. This result implies that there is some cooperation between overexpression of Bcl-2 and caspase inhibition. To further characterize this finding of cooperativity between zVAD-fmk and Bcl-2, we performed a dose-response experiment to determine the magnitude of this cooperativity. As shown in Fig. 4 B, TNFα-induced cell death could be blocked in Neo cells with the addition of 250–500 μm zVAD-fmk. However, there is a log difference between that amount and the amount that is necessary for inhibition of TNFα-induced cell death in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells. In Bcl-2-overexpressing cells, only 25–50 μm zVAD-fmk is required for complete inhibition of TNFα-induced apoptosis. If direct inhibition of Bcl-2 by caspase-mediated cleavage is the reason why Bcl-2 cannot block TNFα-induced cell death, then site-directed mutants that block Bcl-2 cleavage should have the same effect as the ectopic addition of zVAD-fmk. In other words, cleavage-defective mutants of Bcl-2 should provide increased protection against TNFα-induced cell death. It has recently been shown that mutations at amino acids 31 or 34 of the Bcl-2 sequence lead to a noncleavable Bcl-2 protein (32Cheng E.H.-Y. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). We therefore generated two site-directed mutants with amino acid changes from aspartic acid to alanine at amino acids 31 and 34, respectively (D31A and D34A). Because the addition of the HA tag to Bcl-2 has been shown to have no effect on cell survival (see Figs. 1 and 4 A), these site-directed mutants were generated from the HA-Bcl-2 DNA construct. We initially tested the ability of these mutants to functionally block Bcl-2 cleavage in response to TNFα. As shown in Fig.5 A, both site-directed mutants were defective in Bcl-2 cleavage, whereas wild-type Bcl-2 was cleaved into the expected 21-kDa C-terminal cleavage product. However, D31A and D34A cleavage-defective mutants were unable to block TNFα-induced cell death (Fig. 5 B). Also, the cleavage-defective mutants cooperate with 50 μm zVAD-fmk to the same extent as wild-type Bcl-2. The Bcl-2 cleavage-defective mutants were tested for their response to IL-3 withdrawal, and, as in the case of TNFα, there was no effect on viability relative to wild-type Bcl-2 (Fig.5 C). This result also indicates that these site-directed mutations do not affect normal Bcl-2 function. One possible explanation for our results with the Bcl-2 cleavage mutants is that Bcl-2 cleavage represents only one of several mechanisms that result in cooperativity between zVAD-fmk and Bcl-2; therefore, inhibition of cleavage alone is not sufficient to block TNFα-induced cell death. If this is the case, then it stands to reason that the concentration of zVAD-fmk required to cooperate with Bcl-2 cleavage mutants would be lower than that required for wild-type Bcl-2. Therefore, a zVAD-fmk dose-response experiment was performed again; however, this time, HA-Bcl-2 was compared with D31A and D34A mutants in a lower dose range of zVAD-fmk. Cleavage-defective mutants still required 25–50 μm zVAD-fmk to completely block TNFα-induced cell death, and no differences were observed relative to wild-type Bcl-2, even at lower concentrations of zVAD-fmk (Fig.6). These results indicate that Bcl-2 cleavage plays no apparent role in the response to TNFα-induced cell death in the murine pro-B cell line FL5.12. We believe that although Bcl-2 can be cleaved, this is a late event and occurs after the cell has been committed to die. Cleavage of Bcl-2 may amplify the apoptotic response, but cleavage does not appear to be an important regulatory mechanism involved in determining the ability of Bcl-2 to function. We have studied the role of Bcl-2 in response to TNFα-induced cell death. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members have varying effects in response to different stimuli and different cell lines. It has been shown that Bcl-2 can block cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (25Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar, 26Akao Y. Otsuki Y. Kataoka S. Ito Y. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2468-2471PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that Bcl-xLcan form a ternary complex with Apaf-1 and pro-caspase-9 at the mitochondrial outer membrane (27Pan G. O'Rourke K. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5841-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). It is thus believed that Bcl-2/Bcl-xL may be exerting their effects by both sequestering pro-caspase 9 at the mitochondrial surface in an inactive conformation and simultaneously blocking cytochrome crelease and subsequent pro-caspase-9 processing. However, it has recently been demonstrated that not all apoptotic mechanisms are dependent on mitochondria. For example, caspase-9 knockout mice are resistant to a number of apoptotic stimuli and die due to massive brain malformations, but thymocytes from these mice are sensitive to Fas-induced cell death (30Kuida K.

Cell. 1998; 94: 339-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that some cell lines are dependent on mitochondrial signals, whereas others are not, implying that this could be part of the reason for the varying anti-apoptotic responses of Bcl-2 in different cell lines (17Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). In an attempt to decipher differences in the ability of Bcl-2 to block IL-3 withdrawal-induced cell death but not TNFα-induced cell death in the same cell line, we determined that Bcl-2 was cleaved in response to TNFα but not in response to IL-3. Recently, cleavage of Bcl-2 has been reported in response to cell death induced by anti-Fas treatment, IL-3 withdrawal, viral infection, and anticancer treatment (32Cheng E.H.-Y. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 34Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This cleavage occurs after the aspartic acid residue at amino acid 34 of the Bcl-2 protein sequence and can be mediated by caspase-3 in vitro (32Cheng E.H.-Y. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 35Kim Y.-M. Kim T.-H. Seol D.-W. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31437-31441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In these cases, transient transfection of the cleaved Bcl-2 C-terminal fragment was capable of increased cell death, whereas cleavage-defective mutants were more resistant to these cell deaths. It was therefore thought that Bcl-2 cleavage might be an important regulatory mechanism for Bcl-2 function. We have tested the effects of Bcl-2 cleavage in response to TNFα-induced cell death in the IL-3-dependent murine pro-B cell line FL5.12. In these cells, stable overexpression of Bcl-2 is sufficient to block cell death induced by IL-3 withdrawal, and Bcl-2 is not cleaved during the process. This differs from previously published data in which Bcl-2 was cleaved; however, these cells were only protected to a level of 50% viability after 5 days (32Cheng E.H.-Y. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), whereas FL5.12 cells are protected to >80% viability for 8 days after the removal of IL-3. We believe that this difference may be due either to differences in Bcl-2 protein expression levels or to intrinsic differences in the two different cell lines that were used. In contrast to IL-3 withdrawal, TNFα-induced apoptosis was unaffected by Bcl-2 overexpression and associated with Bcl-2 cleavage. This cleavage could be inhibited by the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk. Furthermore, Bcl-2 as well as HA-Bcl-2 can cooperate with 50 μm of the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk to block TNFα-induced cell death. This concentration of zVAD-fmk is capable of blocking caspase-3 activation in vector control-transfected cell lines,2 but these cells die in response to TNFα, implying that TNFα-induced cell death of FL5.12 cells can occur independently of caspase-3 activation. This result can be explained by the redundancy of effector caspases in that perhaps caspase-6 or caspase-7 is activated in these cells and can take the place of caspase-3 to mediate TNFα-induced cell death. Alternatively, caspase-9 activation by mitochondrial dysfunction and cytochrome c release may bypass the requirement for caspase-3 activation. Interestingly, when a zVAD-fmk dose-response experiment was performed with Bcl-2 cells versus Neo control cells, overexpression of Bcl-2 lowered the amount of zVAD-fmk required for inhibition of TNFα-induced apoptosis 10-fold relative to control cells. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that caspase inhibition by zVAD-fmk could be regulating the ability of Bcl-2 to function in response to TNFα-induced cell death. Whereas the amount of Bcl-2 cleaved is not great, previous reports have suggested that the cleavage product could function as a dominant negative protein. Deletion analysis of Bcl-2 revealed that the loss of residues 6–31 created a dominant negative form (36Hunter J.J. Bond B.L. Parslow T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 877-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cheng et al. (32Cheng E.H.-Y. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that overexpression of the caspase-3-cleaved product of Bcl-2 can kill cells. We first wanted to show that we had in fact generated Bcl-2 cleavage-defective mutants (D31A and D34A). However, inhibition of Bcl-2 cleavage had no effect on viability in response to TNFα. Also, these mutants displayed the same level of cooperativity with 50 μm zVAD-fmk. Because overexpression of Bcl-2 lowered the amount of zVAD-fmk required for cooperativity 10-fold compared with control cells, we thought that perhaps cleavage-defective mutants of Bcl-2 would lower the amount of zVAD-fmk required for cooperativity relative to wild-type Bcl-2. However, when lower doses of zVAD-fmk were tested, this was not found to be the case. Cleavage-defective Bcl-2 mutants showed the same level of cooperativity with zVAD-fmk as did wild-type Bcl-2. These combined results imply that Bcl-2 cleavage may play a role in some cell deaths, but it has no apparent role in the response to TNFα. We believe that caspase-mediated cleavage of Bcl-2 is a late event in the apoptotic signal transduction cascade triggered by TNFα and that this cleavage is not an important regulatory mechanism involved in determining Bcl-2 function. Consistent with this hypothesis, it has recently been shown that Bcl-2 can be cleavedin vitro by recombinant caspase-1, -3, -5, -7, and -8 (35Kim Y.-M. Kim T.-H. Seol D.-W. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31437-31441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Of the caspases tested, caspase-3 was most efficient in inducing Bcl-2 cleavage, whereas the upstream caspase, caspase-8, was the least efficient in cleaving Bcl-2, suggesting that Bcl-2 cleavage could be a late apoptotic event. Phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in the 60-amino acid loop domain has also been suggested to play a role in regulating the ability of these proteins to exert their anti-apoptotic effects (37Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar,38Ling Y.-H. Tornos C. Perez-Soler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18984-18991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Chang et al. (33Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) have shown that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL loop-deleted mutants display enhanced viability in response to IL-3 withdrawal and IgM-induced cell death, and these results correlated with a decrease in Bcl-2 phosphorylation. However, recent evidence suggests that Bcl-2 phosphorylation induced by microtubule-disrupting agents such as paclitaxel and an intact loop domain are required for inhibition of cell death induced by such agents (39Fang G. Chang B.S. Kim C.N. Perkins C. Thompson C.B. Bhalla K.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3202-3208PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas we cannot completely rule out the possibility of caspase-activated kinases inducing Bcl-2 phosphorylation, preliminary data suggest that the addition of zVAD-fmk does not lead to decreased Bcl-2 phosphorylation, as would be predicted from direct caspase-activated kinase activity toward Bcl-2.2 For this reason, we do not believe that inhibition of Bcl-2 phosphorylation by inhibition of a caspase-activated kinase is the explanation for the cooperativity that is seen in response to TNFα-induced cell death. It has recently been shown that different cell lines can respond differently to cell death induced by anti-Fas treatment (17Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). One class of cells, termed type I cells, activates caspase-8 and caspase-3 efficiently in a manner independent of mitochondrial signals. For this reason, these cells are not rescued by Bcl-2 expression, which is able to block mitochondrial death signals. Type II cells, on the other hand, do not strongly activate caspase-8 and must use a signaling pathway that is dependent on mitochondrial death signals and is thus inhibited by Bcl-2 expression. FL5.12 cells do not behave like either of these two types of cells in response to TNFα; inhibition of caspase-3 activation by the addition of zVAD-fmk is insufficient to block TNFα-induced cell death, as is inhibition of mitochondrial dysfunction by overexpression of Bcl-2. We favor a model in our system in which type I and type II signals are generated and inhibition of both pathways is required to sufficiently block cell death. The addition of zVAD-fmk can block caspase-3 activation, and Bcl-2 can block mitochondrial signals. Our data also suggest that FL5.12 cells can die in the absence of caspase-3 activation by disruption of the mitochondria and, presumably, caspase-9 activation. We cannot rule out the possibility that caspase-9 activation will lead to the activation of a redundant effector caspase such as caspase-6 or caspase-7 that can cause apoptosis independent of caspase-3. Whereas Bcl-2 cleavage does not appear to be important in the pre-commitment phase of TNFα-induced apoptosis, it may play a role in a post-commitment phase. It has been suggested that activation of caspase-3 can feed back upon the mitochondria and amplify the apoptotic response (40Hengartner M.O. Nature. 1998; 391: 441-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Whereas the potential mitochondrial target of caspase-3 has been elusive, it may be that Bcl-2 is such a substrate. This cleavage of Bcl-2 may be able to amplify the apoptotic response. Further investigation into the pathways involved in TNFα-induced cell death is required to understand where the signaling pathways may diverge and how this may apply to the regulation of various cell deaths that occur in vivo.

The basic backbone structure of GPI that is conserved in all GPI-anchored proteins found in protozoa, yeast, slime mold, fish, and mammals is formulated as EtN-P-6Manα-1,2Manα1–6Manα-1,4GlcNα-1,6-inositol phospholipid (where EtN-P, Man, and GlcN are ethanolamine phosphate, mannose, and glucosamine, respectively) (3Herscovics A.

In affected hematopoietic cells from patients with the acquired hemolytic disease paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, the first step of GPI anchor synthesis is defective due to somatic mutation of the X-linked PIG-A gene (10Takeda J.

The synthesis of GPI is initiated by the transfer ofN-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol (PI) to yield GlcNAc-PI (1Kinoshita T. Ohishi K. Takeda J. J. Biochem.

Genes involved in this step have been cloned by means of complementation of mutants derived from mammalian cells and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: PIG-A, PIG-H, andPIG-C from mammalian cells (12Inoue N.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1637-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A mammalianGPI1 homologue has also been cloned, based on the sequence homology (18Watanabe R. Inoue N. Westfall B. Taron C.H. Orlean P. Takeda J. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A PIG-H homologue is not found in theS. cerevisiae genome. It was shown that PIG-A, PIG-H, PIG-C, and mammalian GPI1 proteins form a complex in the endoplasmic reticulum that has UDP-GlcNAc:PI GlcNAc transferase (GPI-GnT) activity in vitro (18Watanabe R. Inoue N. Westfall B. Taron C.H. Orlean P. Takeda J. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because PIG-A has homology to a bacterial GlcNAc transferase and other glycosyltransferases, this protein is thought to be a catalytic subunit (17Vossen J.H. Ram A.F. Klis F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1243: 549-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Bessler M. Hillmen P. Longo L. Luzzatto L. Mason P.J. Hum. Mol.

However, functions of three other proteins cannot be predicted from their sequences. Class A, C, and H mutant cells, corresponding to PIG-A, PIG-H, andPIG-C mutations, do not express GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface, and their membranes do not have GPI-GnT activity, indicating that these three proteins are essential for the enzyme (21Stevens V.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10039-10042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22Sugiyama E. DeGasperi R. Urakaze M. Chang H.M. Thomas L.J. Hyman R. Warren C.D. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12119-12122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, S. cerevisiae gpi2 and gpi3mutants are defective in GPI anchoring, indicating essential roles ofGPI2 and GPI3 in GPI synthesis (5Leidich S.D. Kostova Z. Latek R.R. Costello L.C. Drapp D.A. Gray W. Fassler J.S. Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13029-13035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast,S. cerevisiae gpi1 is not essential for growth, and thegpi1-disrupted mutant showed temperature-sensitive growth. Moreover, the gpi1-disrupted cells incorporated a significant amount of inositol to proteins and generated mature Gas1p, a major GPI-anchored protein. Therefore, GPI1 may have a regulatory function rather than a direct role in the enzymatic function (15Leidich S.D. Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27829-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As described above, human GPI1 (hGPI1) is contained in the GPI-GnT complex (18Watanabe R. Inoue N. Westfall B. Taron C.H. Orlean P. Takeda J. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that hGPI1 physically associates with three other subunits, suggesting a role for hGPI1 in complex formation (18Watanabe R. Inoue N. Westfall B. Taron C.H. Orlean P. Takeda J. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). More recently, it was reported that human and mouseGPI1 cDNAs complemented S. cerevisiae gpi1and Schizosaccharomyces pombe gpi1 mutants (23Colussi P.A. Orlean P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), indicating that mammalian GPI1 is functionally homologous to yeast Gpi1p (24Tiede A. Schubert J. Nischan C. Jensen I. Westfall B. Taron C. Orlean P. Schmidt R.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To clarify the function of GPI1 in GPI-GnT, in the present study, we generated GPI1 knockout mouse cells and found that GPI1 is necessary for stable formation of the GPI-GnT complex and stable expression of the PIG-C and PIG-H proteins. Mouse embryonal carcinoma F9 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum on 0.1% gelatin-coated dishes. Mouse GPI-deficient mutant lymphoma T1M1 (Thy-1−c) and S49 (Thy-1−h) cells were gifts from Dr. R. Hyman (Salk Institute, San Diego, CA) and were cultured and transfected as described previously (25Watanabe R. Kinoshita T. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Takeda J. Inoue N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26868-26875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To express mouse GPI, its cDNA was cloned to a pMEEB expression vector. To express GST-tagged PIG-A, GST-tagged-PIG-H, and FLAG-tagged-PIG-C at the same time, each fragment was cloned between the PGK promoter and the PGK poly(A) signal in pBS-PGKtk (7Kawagoe K. Kitamura D. Okabe M. Taniuchi I. Ikawa M. Watanabe T. Kinoshita T. Takeda J. Blood. 1996; 87: 3600-3606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three constructs were tandemly blunt-ligated in pBS-PGKzeo to introduce the zeocin resistance gene. This plasmid restored the surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins on humanPIG-A-deficient JY5 cells, Pig-c-deficient T1M1 cells (Thy-1−c), and Pig-h-deficient S49 cells (Thy-1−h). To express FLAG-tagged hGPI1, it was cloned between the PGK promoter and the PGK poly(A) signal in pBS-PGKtk and then ligated with pBS-PGKzeo to generate pBS-FLAG-hGPI1/zeo. All of the other constructs used in this study were described previously (25Watanabe R. Kinoshita T. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Takeda J. Inoue N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26868-26875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We designed degenerate primers on the basis of hGPI1 and yeast Gpi1p amino acid sequences to clone mGPI1 cDNA (15Leidich S.D. Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27829-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18Watanabe R. Inoue N. Westfall B. Taron C.H. Orlean P. Takeda J. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Two primers, forward primer HF1 (5′-GTGCTCCCGCNGGNYTNAARATGAA-3′) (N; A, T, G, and C: Y; C and T: R; A and G) and reverse primer HR1 (5′-GGAYGGTGAAGAGNARNGTNCCDAT-3′) (D; G, A, and T), and template DNA derived from a mouse testis cDNA library were used for 35 cycles of amplification reaction under the conditions of 94 °C (1 min), 55 °C (30 s), and 68 °C (1.5 min) for denaturation, annealing, and extension, respectively. A sequence of the PCR product was confirmed to be homologous to hGPI1. To obtain the 5′ and 3′ regions, we screened 96 subpools of a cDNA library, each of which contained 2 × 104 independent clones, with PCR using the same primers. We selected four subpools showing a positive PCR band. Using DNAs of these pools, forward vector primer, and HR1 primer in PCR, fragments containing the 5′ region were cloned from the subpools. The longest clone was named pGH5c7. Using HF1 primer and reverse vector primer, fragments containing the 3′ region were cloned. All subpools gave the same fragments. The longest 5′ and 3′ fragments were ligated in the EcoRV site to generate full-length cDNA. An analysis by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends with the Marathon RACE kit (CLONTECH) using RNA from F9 cells confirmed that this cDNA contained the longest 5′ sequence. To obtain genomic clones of mGPI1, we screened 1 × 106 plaque-forming units of lambda FIXII from a mouse 129/SvJ liver genomic library (Stratagene) using a 1.4-kb pGH5c7 fragment, which contained the 5′ region of mGPI1 cDNA, as a probe. We obtained eight positive clones. A 9.4-kb HindIII genomic fragment ofmGPI1 was blunted and transferred to the SmaI site of pBS, the EcoRI-XbaI fragment was then transferred to pPNT (26Tybulewicz V.L.J. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar), and the plasmid was named pPNT-18HdelF. A 2.1-kb XbaI-EcoRV fragment of mGPI1containing exons 9 and 10 was blunted and transferred to pBS. ItsXhoI-NotI fragment and a 1.8-kbXbaI-XhoI fragment derived from PGKpuro were ligated in tandem in the XbaI-NotI site in pPNT-18HdelF. This plasmid was then used as the first targeting vector. A 3.0-kb EcoRV fragment containing a region extending from the middle of exon 6 to exon 10 was transferred to the SmaI site of pBS. Its XhoI-XbaI fragment and a 1.9-kbXbaI-XhoI fragment derived from PGKneo were ligated in the XbaI-NotI site of pPNT-18HdelF. The generated plasmid was used as the second targeting vector. F9 cells (2 × 107) were electroporated with 50 μg of NotI-cut targeting vector at 230 V and 500 microfarads using a GenePulser (Bio-Rad) and seeded on plates coated with 0.1% gelatin. Positive selection was started the next day with 2 μg/ml puromycin or 380 μg/ml G418. Three days later, negative selection with 2 μm gancyclovir was performed. About 8–11 days after transfection, we screened colonies for recombinants, using PCR primers PGK-PA2970 (5′-CCTGAAGAACGAGATCAGCAGCCTCTGT-3′) and MGPI-KO154 (5′-TGTTTTATCACAATCTTGAGCACTATGG-3′) for the first targeting and PGK3254 (5′-CTGAGCCCAGAAAGCGAAGGAGCAAAGC-3′) and MGPI-KO154 for the second targeting. PCRs were started at 93 °C (1 min) followed by annealing at 62 °C (1 min) and extension at 68 °C (3 min) for 35 cycles using Long Template PCR enzyme and buffers (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Positive colonies were confirmed by Southern blot analysis. For Northern blot analysis of mousePig-c, poly(A) RNA (10 μg) prepared using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the Poly(A)Tract mRNA isolation system (Promega) was separated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and then transferred to a nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized with aPig-c cDNA probe and rehybridized with aEF1α cDNA probe (a gift from Dr. S. Nagata). ThePig-c cDNA probe was amplified with forward primer 5′-TGGGCTGTGGTATTTGAGTCCAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGGCTCCCACAGCACTGGAC-3′ from a mouse cDNA library. To examine the surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins, cells were stained with biotinylated anti-Thy1.2 or anti-CD59 antibody and phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Biomedica) and then subjected to analysis in a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) (25Watanabe R. Kinoshita T. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Takeda J. Inoue N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26868-26875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cell lysates (derived from 1 × 107cells) and microsomes (200 μg of protein equivalents) were prepared as described previously (18Watanabe R. Inoue N. Westfall B. Taron C.H. Orlean P. Takeda J. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). They were labeled with 2 μCi of UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc (14 μCi/mol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) for 1 h at 37 °C as described, and the generated glycolipids were separated by TLC on Kiesel Gel 60 (Merck) with a solvent system of CHCl3:methanol:1 mNH4OH (10:10:3) (18Watanabe R. Inoue N. Westfall B. Taron C.H. Orlean P. Takeda J. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To assay Dol-P-Glc synthase as a control, cell lysates (106 cells) and microsomes (40 μg of protein equivalents) were incubated with UDP-[6-3H]glucose for 20 min at 37 °C in 50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2 and 5 mmMnCl2. The reaction was terminated by adding CHCl3:methanol (2:1). The organic phase removed from the mixture was washed two times with CHCl3:methanol (2:1)-saturated water, evaporated, and separated by TLC with a solvent system of CHCl3:methanol:water (10:10:3) (27Maeda Y. Tomita S. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4920-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Amounts of labeled lipids were quantitated by a Fuji Image Analyzer BAS1500 (Fuji Film Co., Tokyo Japan). Treatments of lipids with Bacillus thuringiensis PI-phospholipase C (PLC) (Funakoshi, Japan) and acetylation of lipids were done as described previously (28Hirose S. Ravi L. Hazra S.V. Medof M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3762-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mild alkaline hydrolysis was done as described previously (21Stevens V.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10039-10042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfectant cells (2–4 × 108) were hypotonically lysed in water containing 0.1 mm TLCK and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, mixed with an equal volume of a lysate buffer (100 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm TLCK, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and stored at −80 °C until used. After thawing on ice, the cell lysates were further treated using a tight pestle Dounce homogenizer. Membranes and cytosol fractions were divided by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The collected membranes were solubilized in 1% digitonin in 50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm TLCK, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin or 1% Nonidet P-40 in 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.7), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm TLCK, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h, and supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation. For the cytosol fractions, Nonidet P-40 was added at 1% and used for immunoprecipitation. Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel beads (Sigma) and glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used to collect FLAG- and GST-tagged proteins, respectively. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting. Western blotting was carried out with biotinylated anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 plus horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or with anti-GST antibody (Amersham Pharmarcia Biotech) plus horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody (Organon Teknika) and visualized with chemiluminescence (Renaissance; DuPont). The band intensities in Western blotting were quantitated by measuring chemiluminescence with a Fuji Image analyzer LAS1000. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was carried out with a biotinylated genomic DNA probe for mGPI1 and a biotinylated cDNA probe forhGPI1 prepared as described previously (10Takeda J. Miyata T. Kawagoe K. Iida Y. Endo Y. Fujita T. Takahashi M. Kitani T. Kinoshita T. Cell. 1993; 73: 703-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). The full-length mGPI1 cDNA contained 3062 nucleotides except a poly(A) tract, encoding a 581-amino acid protein that had an 89% amino acid identity to hGPI1(GenBank accession number for mGPI1 cDNA is AB008895.). Using a mGPI1 cDNA probe, we obtained eight genomic clones of mGPI1, mapped them, and sequenced around the exons (GenBank accession numbers for the genomic sequences are AB008915 toAB008921). Exon sequences were exactly the same as that of the cDNA. The mGPI1 gene had 11 exons, containing a start codon in exon 2 and a stop codon in exon 11 (Fig.1 A). This structure was similar to a partial structure of hGPI1 determined by analyzing a sequence obtained from GenBankTM (Fig.1 B). Their corresponding exons had the same lengths. The amino acid sequence of mGPI1 was very different from that published recently as mouse GPI1 (24Tiede A. Schubert J. Nischan C. Jensen I. Westfall B. Taron C. Orlean P. Schmidt R.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (GenBank accession number AF030178), having only a 93% amino acid identity. We think that the published sequence is not that of mouse GPI1because: 1) our cDNA sequence and genomic exon sequence were exactly the same, 2) many mouse expressed sequence tag (EST) nucleotide sequences in the current databases matched exactly with our sequence, 3) the mGPI1 gene was successfully disrupted using ourmGPI1 DNA fragments, and 4) their sequence was simply that of an EST clone and was not confirmed in mouse cDNA or DNA. We used the F9 cell line to generatemGPI1-disrupted cells because it has a relatively high frequency of homologous recombination and is easier to culture than embryonic stem cells. We designed two targeting vectors: the vector for the first targeting had the puromycin resistance gene in place of exon 2 to exon 8, and the vector for the second targeting had the neomycin resistance gene in place of exon 2 to a part of exon 6 (Fig.2 A). Colonies grown after antibiotic selection were screened with PCR (Fig. 2 B) and confirmed with genomic Southern blotting (Fig. 2 C). Bands corresponding to the wild type allele decreased after the first targeting (lanes 2) and disappeared after the second targeting with generation of the predicted targeted bands (lanes 3). After the second targeting, no 3.1-kb RNA band ofmGPI1 was seen in Northern blotting (Fig. 2 D), indicating that both alleles were disrupted. We first assessed the surface expression of Thy-1, a GPI-anchored protein onmGPI1-knockout F9 cells, and found that the expression decreased greatly but remained at a low level (Fig.3 A). The surface Thy-1 expression was restored upon transfection of mGPI1 cDNA but not upon transfection of an empty vector (Fig. 3 B). To confirm that mGPI1 knockout cells have some ability to generate GPI-anchored proteins, we transfected a cDNA of CD59. CD59 was more efficiently expressed on the cell surface, whereas the expression of endogeneous Thy-1 stayed very low (Fig. 3 C). These results showed that mGPI1 knockout cells still have some GPI-GnT activity. We next measured GPI-GnT activity in vitro using cell lysates and microsomes of mGPI1 knockout cells (Fig.4). In contrast to the significant surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins on mGPI1knockout cells, their lysates and microsomal membranes did not generate GlcNAc-PI upon incubation with UDP-GlcNAc (lanes 2 in Fig.4 A and B), whereas they had comparable activities of dolichol phosphate glucose (Dol-P-Glc) synthase. This defect was restored by transfection of mGPI1 cDNA (lanes 3) but not by transfection of an empty vector (lanes 4). The lysates of mGPI1 knockout cells gave several radioactive spots, one of which had the same mobility as GlcN-PI (lane 2), the second intermediate derived from GlcNAc-PI by deacetylation. To determine whether it is GlcN-PI or a non-relevant material, we first tested for the presence of PI by treatment with PI-PLC (Fig.5 A). The spot was resistant to PI-PLC (lanes 3 and 4), whereas the GlcN-PI generated by the wild type cells was sensitive, as shown by a great decrease of the intensity (lanes 1 and 2), indicating that the spot did not contain PI. We next tested acetylation that would convert GlcN-PI to GlcNAc-PI (Fig. 5 B). GlcN-PI generated by the wild type cells was acetylated to GlcNAc-PI, resulting in a decrease of GlcN-PI and a slight increase of GlcNAc-PI (lanes 1 and 2); however, the spot generated bymGPI1 knockout cells did not shift to the GlcNAc-PI position (lanes 3 and 4). As a final test, we treated the spot with mild alkali (Fig. 5 C). If it contained diacylglycerol, then the acyl chains would be removed, causing a mobility shift or disappearance from the lipid fraction. The spot was resistant (lanes 3 and 4), whereas GlcN-PI and GlcNAc-PI were sensitive (lanes 1 and 2). All of these results indicated that the spot was not GlcN-PI. Other spots seen above and below the area corresponding to GlcNAc-PI and GlcN-PI should also be non-relevant. They are not related to N-glycans because a 10× higher concentration of tunicamycin did not affect them (data not shown). Therefore, the membranes of mGPI1 knockout cells did not have a detectable level of GPI-GnT activity in vitro.Figure 5Characterization of GlcNAc-labeled products. Lysates (from 2 × 107 cells) of wild type (lanes 1 and 2 in all panels) andmGPI1 knockout (lanes 3 and 4 in all panels) F9 cells were labeled with UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc for 1 h. A, extracted radiolabeled lipids were treated with PI-PLC (lanes 2 and 4) or a reaction buffer (lanes 1 and 3), and reextracted lipids were analyzed by TLC. B, the same samples as in A were treated with acetic anhydride (lanes 2 and 4) or a buffer (lanes 1 and 3). C, the same samples as in A and B were treated with mild alkali (lanes 2 and 4) or a neutral buffer (lanes 1 and 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We thought that the weak expression of Thy-1 on mGPIknockout cells (Fig. 3 A) might be due to inefficient recognition of GPI attachment signals of Thy-1 by GPI transamidase in the presence of a limited amount of GPI. To test this, we replaced the GPI attachment signal sequence of CD59 with that of Thy-1 and compared it with wild-type CD59. As shown in Fig.6, CD59 bearing the GPI attachment signal of Thy-1 was processed much less efficiently than CD59 bearing its own signal. The above results demonstrated that a very low level of GPI-GnT activity was expressed in the absence of mGPI1. A possible explanation for this is that the GPI-GnT complex cannot be formed efficiently in the absence of mGPI1. Another possible explanation is that a protein complex of PIG-A, PIG-C, and PIG-H is formed even in the absence of mGPI1 but has a very weak activity. To test the former possibility, we stably transfected mGPI1 knockout cells with a vector bearing cDNAs for FLAG-tagged PIG-C and GST-tagged PIG-A and PIG-H. A vector for free GST was also cotransfected to the same cells. A clonal cell population was isolated by limiting dilution and further transfected with either mGPI1 cDNA or an empty vector. Therefore, two cells would potentially express tagged PIG-C, PIG-A, and PIG-H and free GST at the same levels, with the sole difference being the presence or absence of mGPI1. From digitonin extracts of these cells, we precipitated FLAG-tagged PIG-C with anti-FLAG beads, and coprecipitations of GST-tagged PIG-A and PIG-H were assessed by Western blotting with anti-GST (Fig.7 A). In the presence of mGPI1, GST-tagged PIG-A and PIG-H were clearly coprecipitated (lane 1), indicating the formation of complexes of PIG-A, PIG-H, PIG-C, and mGPI1. In contrast, almost no bands of GST-tagged PIG-H and PIG-A were seen in the absence of mGPI1 (lane 2). These cells expressed comparable levels of free GST in the cytoplasm (bottom panel). Therefore, only a trace amount, if any, of the protein complex was formed in the absence of mGPI1. To evaluate the amounts of expressed FLAG-tagged PIG-C, we analyzed the immunoprecipitates with anti-FLAG beads by Western blotting against anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 7 A, lanes 3 and4). The amount of FLAG-PIG-C was significantly lower in the absence (lane 4) than in the presence (lane 3) of mGPI1, whereas a nonspecific band (asterisk) and a light chain of the antibody (L) showed comparable intensities. We also evaluated the amounts of expressed GST-tagged PIG-A and PIG-H by collecting them from Nonidet P-40 extracts with glutathione-Sepharose beads followed by Western blotting against anti-GST antibody (lanes 5 and 6). The amount of GST-tagged PIG-H was significantly lower in the absence (lane 6) than in the presence (lane 5) of mGPI1, whereas the amounts of GST-tagged PIG-A were comparable. The intensities of these bands and bands of free GST collected from the cytoplasm were quantitated by an image analyzer. Expression levels of PIG-C and PIG-H decreased to one-third of the wild type levels in the absence of mGPI1, whereas PIG-A and a control free GST were expressed at similar levels. These results were from cloned cells. To eliminate the chance that an unusual event might have occurred due to the use of cloned cells, we used cells without limiting dilution. For this we transiently cotransfected mGPI1 knockout cells with a vector bearing cDNAs for FLAG-tagged PIG-C and GST-tagged PIG-A and PIG-H in combination with mGPI1 cDNA or an empty vector and assessed the complex formation and expressions of three tagged proteins. We obtained results very similar to those with the cloned cells (data not shown). To test the association between PIG-A and PIG-H in the absence of GPI1, we cotransfected GST-tagged PIG-H and FLAG-tagged PIG-A intomGPI knockout cells (Fig. 7 B, lane 1). As a positive control, GST-tagged GPI1 and FLAG-tagged PIG-A were cotransfected (lane 2). As negative controls, GST-tagged ALDH (aldehyde dehydrogenase, a control endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein (29Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1407-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)) and FLAG-tagged PIG-A (lane 3) and GST-tagged PIG-H and FLAG-tagged ALDH (lane 4) were cotransfected, respectively. FLAG-tagged PIG-A was efficiently coprecipitated with GST-tagged PIG-H (lane 1), but not with GST-tagged ALDH (lane 3). FLAG-tagged ALDH was not coprecipitated with GST-tagged PIG-H (lane 4). Therefore, PIG-A and PIG-H associated specifically and efficiently in the absence of GPI1. This indicated that the efficient association of PIG-C with a complex of PIG-A and PIG-H is dependent upon GPI1. Because GP11 is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein (18Watanabe R. Inoue N. Westfall B. Taron C.H. Orlean P. Takeda J. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that the GPI1 protein affects transcriptions of thePIG-C and PIG-H genes. In fact, the expression levels of endogenous mouse Pig-c mRNA assessed by Northern blotting did not change between wild type and mGPI1knockout cells (data not shown). It is likely that GPI1 affects the stability of the PIG-C and PIG-H proteins. However, the decreased levels of PIG-C and PIG-H were still 30% of the wild type levels, which does not fully explain a nearly complete lack of complexes of PIG-A, PIG-C, and PIG-H. Therefore, GPI1 must function in the maintenance of the GPI-GnT complex itself. To see whether the expression of GPI1 is conversely influenced by PIG-C and PIG-H, we cotransfected FLAG-tagged hGPI1 and free GST, as a control, into Pig-c-deficient TIM1 cells (Thy-1−c) and Pig-h-deficient S49 cells (Thy-1−h), obtained the cloned cells, and transfected them with PIG-C and PIG-H cDNA, respectively, or with an empty vector. An analysis by fluorescence-activated cell sorting confirmed that PIG-C-transfected T1M1 (Thy-1−c) cells and PIG-H-transfected S49 cells (Thy-1−h) but not vector transfectants restored the surface expression of Thy-1 proteins (data not shown). However, the amounts of expressed FLAG-tagged GPI1 did not change significantly in the presence (Fig. 8 A, lane 1) and absence (lane 2) of PIG-C or in the presence (Fig.8 B, lane 1) and absence (lane 2) of PIG-H. Therefore, it seems that GPI1 influences the stability of PIG-C and PIG-H, but not PIG-A, but that the stability of GPI1 is not influenced by PIG-C and PIG-H. We investigated the chromosomal localization of mGPI1 and hGPI1using fluorescence in situ hybridization. With a 15.2-kb genomic fragment from a lamda clone as a probe, we localizedmGPI1 to mouse chromosome 17B (Fig.9 A). Using a 2.9-kbhGPI1 cDNA probe, we localized hGPI1 to human chromosome 16p13.3 (Fig. 9 B). These mouse and human chromosome regions are syntenic (30Blake J.A. Eppig J.T. Richardson J.E. Davisson M.T. Group T.M.G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The autosomal location of mammalian GPI1 is consistent with the notion that onlyPIG-A is X-linked among all GPI-anchor synthesis genes (1Kinoshita T. Ohishi K. Takeda J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this report, we present direct evidence that GPI1 is necessary for the stable formation of GPI-GnT. We disrupted mouse GPI1in F9 embryonal carcinoma cells and found that the generation of GPI-anchored proteins was severely affected in the absence of GPI1. This defect was accounted for by a decrease of complexes of PIG-C with PIG-A and PIG-H to a nearly undetectable level, whereas an association between PIG-A and PIG-H was still seen. In the absence of GPI1, the levels of PIG-C and PIG-H were only one-third of the wild type levels, indicating that GPI1 is needed to maintain normal levels of these proteins. The level of PIG-A was not affected by the absence of GPI1. These partial losses of PIG-C and PIG-H alone cannot fully account for the nearly complete lack of the complex of these components. Therefore, it is indicated that GPI1 is required for the efficient association of PIG-C with a complex of PIG-A and PIG-H. This is consistent with our previous report that GPI1 directly associates with each of the three other proteins (18Watanabe R. Inoue N. Westfall B. Taron C.H. Orlean P. Takeda J. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Among the four proteins participating in GPI-GnT, PIG-A, PIG-C, and PIG-H are essential for activity because their mutant cells are completely defective in GPI-GnT (21Stevens V.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10039-10042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sugiyama E. DeGasperi R. Urakaze M. Chang H.M. Thomas L.J. Hyman R. Warren C.D. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12119-12122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas GPI1 is not essential because GPI1 knockout cells still had some ability to generate GPI-anchored proteins. This phenotype of mGPI1knockout F9 cells is similar to that of gpi1-disruptedS. cerevisiae that was lethal at a higher temperature but was viable and incorporated some inositol to proteins at 25 °C (15Leidich S.D. Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27829-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Expression of mammalian GPI1 in gpi1-disrupted S. cerevisiae restored growth at a higher temperature and synthesis of GlcNAc-PI in vitro (24Tiede A. Schubert J. Nischan C. Jensen I. Westfall B. Taron C. Orlean P. Schmidt R.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), indicating that mammalian and yeast GPI1 proteins have conserved sites for association with other components. In the absence of GPI1, proteins that are normally GPI-anchored would compete for a limited amount of GPI. Proteins bearing different carboxyl-terminal GPI attachment signals may have different affinities for GPI transamidase that recognizes the GPI attachment signal and replaces it with GPI (2Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The mGPI1 knockout F9 cells expressed a very low level of Thy-1 on the surface but expressed CD59 quite efficiently, indicating that the GPI attachment signal of CD59 functioned more efficiently than that of Thy-1. A possible reason for this is that the signal sequence of CD59 contains asparagine at the ω site (31Sugita Y. Nakano Y. Oda E. Noda K. Tobe T. Miura N.H. Tomita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) to which GPI is linked, whereas the signal of Thy-1 has cysteine at the ω site (32Homans S.W. Ferguson M.A. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Anand R. Williams A.F. Nature. 1988; 333: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). There are reports that the asparagine ω site functions more efficiently than the cysteine ω site in the GPI attachment reaction (33Gerber L.D. Kodukula K. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12168-12173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Moran P. Raab H. Kohr W.J. Caras I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1250-1257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Nuoffer C. Horvath A. Riezman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10558-10563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We localized the mouse GPI1 gene to chromosome 17B and localized human GPI1 to chromosome 16p13.3. This autosomal location is consistent with the fact that two homologous recombinations were required to eliminate mGPI1. This is also consistent with the observation that most, if not all, patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria lost the ability for biosynthesis of GlcNAc-PI in their affected blood cells due to somatic mutation of thePIG-A gene in the hematopoietic stem cell (36Kinoshita T. Inoue N. Takeda J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1996; 47: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). BecausePIG-A is X-linked, a single somatic mutation should cause the GPI-GnT deficiency, whereas two somatic mutations ofGPI1 should occur in the same cell to cause the mutant phenotype. The latter probability would be extremely low. It is difficult to predict the outcome of a hereditary lack ofGPI1. Although a complete lack of GPI synthesis causes embryonic lethality (7Kawagoe K. Kitamura D. Okabe M. Taniuchi I. Ikawa M. Watanabe T. Kinoshita T. Takeda J. Blood. 1996; 87: 3600-3606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nozaki M. Ohishi K. Yamada N. Kinoshita T. Nagy A. Takeda J. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 293-299PubMed Google Scholar), no information is available about the effects of a partial GPI deficiency. We thank Dr. Junji Takeda for discussion and Keiko Kinoshita for technical assistance."

The central domain of tailspike, a large right-handed parallel β-helix, is essentially structured in this species. We used the isolated β-helix domain (Bhx), expressed with a hexahistidine tag, to investigate the mechanism of aggregation without the two terminal domains present in the complete protein. Although Bhx has been shown to fold reversibly at low ionic strength conditions, increased ionic strength induced aggregation with a maximum at urea concentrations corresponding to the midpoint of urea-induced folding transitions. According to size exclusion chromatography, aggregation appeared to proceed via a linear polymerization mechanism. Circular dichroism indicated a secondary structure content of the aggregates similar to that of the native state, but at the same time their tryptophan fluorescence was largely quenched. Microscopic analysis of the aggregates revealed a variety of morphologies; among others, fibrils with fine structure were observed that exhibited bright green birefringence if viewed under cross-polarized light after staining with Congo red. These observations, together with the effects of folding mutations on the aggregation process, indicate the involvement of a partially structured intermediate distinct from both unfolded and native Bhx.

Whereas some small single-domain proteins have been shown to fold without detectable intermediates (1Jackson S.E. Fersht A.R.

Biol. 1995; 2: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), many larger, especially multidomain and oligomeric proteins are known to populate intermediates during their folding process, often leading to aggregation as a side reaction (5Jaenicke R. Seckler R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 1-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insoluble aggregates of normally well behaved proteins are characteristic of a variety of human disease states, including various forms of amyloidosis (6Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 7Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) and the prion diseases (8Prusiner S.B. Science. 1997; 278: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Protein aggregation is also a common problem encountered during the heterologous expression of proteins or their renaturation in vitro (9Mitraki A. King J. Bio/Technology. 1989; 7: 690-697Crossref Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Processes such as the formation of inclusion bodies or aggregation during refolding in vitro were commonly regarded as being driven by nonspecific, hydrophobic interactions between random coil or molten globule-like states of proteins. The formation of extracellular amyloid fibrils, on the other hand, has frequently been illustrated according to the sickle hemoglobin model, which invokes the alteration of surface properties of the native state of proteins as the reason for noncovalent polymerization. A growing body of evidence, however, suggests that protein aggregation in most cases occurs by mechanisms involving structured folding intermediates. Early studies,e.g. on tryptophanase (10London J. Skrzynia C. Goldberg M.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), lactate dehydrogenase (11Zettlmeissl G. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5567-5571Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and bovine growth hormone (12Brems D.N. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4541-4546Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar), had suggested a model involving structured folding intermediates, with domains or subdomains folded as they are in the native state but which undergo intermolecular rather than intramolecular interactions. This concept has meanwhile been well established for a series of other proteins, especially some of those known to be involved in human amyloid diseases such as transthyretin (13Kelly J.W. Colon W. Lai Z. Lashuel H.A. McCulloch J. McCutchen S.L. Miroy G.J. Peterson S.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 161-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), immunoglobulin light chains (14Wetzel R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 243-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or lysozyme (15Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Blake C.C. Pepys M.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). An important model protein used to study the kinetic partitioning between folding and aggregation is the tailspike of bacteriophage P22. Tailspike folding yields decrease dramatically with increasing temperature, with very similar dependences in vivo andin vitro (16Haase-Pettingell C.A. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4977-4983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Danner M. Fuchs A. Miller S. Seckler R. Eur. J.

Marcel Dekker, New York1997: 391-413Google Scholar). The temperature dependence is even more drastic for a type of mutants designated temperature sensitive for folding ortsf 1The abbreviations used are: tsf , temperature sensitive for folding (mutant); su , global suppressor (mutant); TSP, complete tailspike protein; GdmHCl, guanidinium hydrochloride; Bhx, isolated β-helix domain of the tailspike protein; TSPΔN, amino-terminally truncated TSP; SEC, size exclusion chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: tsf , temperature sensitive for folding (mutant); su , global suppressor (mutant); TSP, complete tailspike protein; GdmHCl, guanidinium hydrochloride; Bhx, isolated β-helix domain of the tailspike protein; TSPΔN, amino-terminally truncated TSP; SEC, size exclusion chromatography.(19Smith D.H.

These tsf mutations prevent the formation of the native trimer at high growth temperature, but once assembled at a lower permissive temperature, the mutant tailspike trimers have full biological activity at the restrictive temperature (21Goldenberg D.P. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 633-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Tsfmutations have been identified at more than 40 independent sites almost exclusively in the central β-helix domain (22Yu M.-H. King J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6584-6588Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Yu M.-H. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1424-1431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Villafane R. King J. J. Mol.

Biol. 1997; 267: 88-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the main structural motif of tailspike (Fig. 1). A second class of mutations, isolated as global suppressors (su) of thetsf phenotype, have the opposite effect; they increase the yield of correctly assembled tailspikes at higher temperature, thus compensating for the effect of tsf mutations (26Fane B. Villafane R. Mitraki A. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11640-11648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mitraki A. Fane B. Haase-Pettingell C. Sturtevant J. King J. Science. 1991; 253: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Biophysical studies of tailspike folding in vitro confirmed that the tsf mutations affect tailspike folding by destabilizing thermolabile intermediates in the folding and assembly pathway and suggested that the su mutations stabilize such intermediates (28Danner M. Seckler R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1869-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A series of observations implied that the β-helix domain is largely structured in these intermediates (5Jaenicke R. Seckler R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 1-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Schuler B. Seckler R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for this hypothesis was obtained by expressing the central β-helix as an isolated domain (30Miller S. Schuler B. Seckler R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9160-9168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and investigating the effects of the tsf and su mutations on its stability (29Schuler B. Seckler R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As opposed to the complete protein, unfolding of the isolated domain is freely reversible in urea at low protein concentrations, low ionic strength, and low temperature, such that equilibrium data and thus a quantification of the effects of folding mutations on the thermodynamic stability can be obtained. The introduction of tsf mutations clearly destabilized, whereas su mutations stabilized the isolated domain. The differential effect of the four knownsu mutations on the stability of the isolated β-helix on the one hand, and on the native trimeric protein on the other, further suggested that the conformation of the isolated β-helix domain is close to that of the thermolabile intermediate populated during folding of the complete protein and responsible for kinetic partitioning between productive folding and aggregation (29Schuler B. Seckler R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The off-pathway reaction leading to the incorporation of tailspike chains into inclusion bodies has been studied in vitro by initiating refolding of the complete tailspike protein at intermediate denaturant concentrations at which a large fraction of the refolding chains can be induced to aggregate at temperatures as low as 20 °C (31Mitraki A. Danner M. King J. Seckler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20071-20075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Speed M.A. Wang D.I. King J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 900-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the association steps involved are irreversible and slow, allowing the electrophoretic separation of misassembly intermediates and their immunochemical analysis (32Speed M.A. Wang D.I. King J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 900-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 33Speed M.A. Wang D.I.C. King J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1283-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 34Speed M.A. Moreshead T. Wang D.I.C. King J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Sequential multimeric species from dimers up to hexamers or heptamers were observed as misassembly intermediates, such that the misassembly reaction can be described as a linear polymerization process. The reaction is specific, in the sense that tailspike polypeptides do not form mixed aggregates with P22 coat protein chains or carbonic anhydrase when induced to aggregate simultaneously (33Speed M.A. Wang D.I.C. King J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1283-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the aggregates, although reactive with anti-tailspike antibodies that do not recognize the native trimer, grow by incorporating tailspike chains in a specific, partly folded conformation rather than originating from unfolded chains. Here we report on the investigation of the aggregation process of the isolated β-helix domain of tailspike. Reversible unfolding of the domain could be reached only under the optimized conditions described (30Miller S. Schuler B. Seckler R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9160-9168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but a drastic aggregation tendency had already been obvious from the handling of the protein during purification and storage, and reversible unfolding could not be attained at temperatures much above 10 °C or at high protein concentration. At low to medium protein concentration and low temperature, the aggregation process is slow enough to be analyzed by spectroscopic methods or size exclusion chromatography. The results suggest the involvement of a particularly aggregation-prone, structured equilibrium intermediate that can be stabilized by high ionic strength and that can lead to the formation of fibrous aggregates. UV transparent plastic fluorescence cells (Kartell 4.5-ml PMMA cuvettes) were obtained from Semadeni (Ostermundingen, Switzerland). Ultrapure urea and guanidinium hydrochloride were purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH), and solutions containing urea were prepared fresh before use. Congo red was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Denaturant concentrations were determined by refractive index measurements (35Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). The isolated β-helix domain was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography via a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidyl tag as described and stored at −70 °C (30Miller S. Schuler B. Seckler R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9160-9168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Folding transitions were measured in a Perkin-Elmer MPF3 or a Spex FluoroMax spectrofluorometer with thermostatted cell holder using plastic fluorescence cuvettes or fused silica semimicro fluorescence cells at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and an emission wavelength of 337 nm. CD measurements were made in an AVIV 62A-DS spectropolarimeter using calibrated fused silica semimicro fluorescence cells (path length, 4.2 mm; Hellma 104F-QS). For unfolding transitions, cold 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 m sodium chloride and 1 mm EDTA (Buffer A) was first added to a small volume of concentrated protein solution; then a cold concentrated urea solution of known molarity containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.5m sodium chloride, and 1 mm EDTA was added to give a final volume of 1.2 ml (for measurements in plastic cuvettes) or 0.6 ml (for measurements in fused silica cuvettes) and an accurately known concentration of denaturant. For refolding transitions, urea solution was added first, the samples were incubated for at least 10 min, and refolding was initiated by rapid dilution with cold Buffer A. Mixing was carried out on ice if not indicated otherwise. For refolding kinetics, protein was denatured in Buffer A containing 6 murea for at least 10 min. Refolding was initiated by rapid dilution to a final urea concentration of 2 m and a protein concentration of 100 μg/ml. Circular dichroism was recorded at 10 °C as described above. Sedimentation equilibrium runs were performed in a Beckman Model E analytical ultracentrifuge using double-sector cells with a 12-mm optical path length and sample volumes of 360 μl (column height, 1.1 cm) at 18 °C and rotor speed between 3,000 and 12,000 rpm. Light scattering was measured in a Spex FluoroMax spectrofluorometer with thermostatted cell holder. Samples were stirred gently in silica semimicro fluorescence cells at 10 °C (Hellma 119.004F-QS), and the intensity of scattered light was measured using a wavelength of 360 nm. Protein denatured in Buffer A containing urea (see above) was rapidly mixed with Buffer A to a final urea concentration of 2 m, a protein concentration of 100 μg/ml, and a volume of 1.2 ml on ice, and then it was quickly transferred to a thermostatted cuvette. Control experiments performed under identical conditions with EDTA concentrations varying between 1 and 100 mm indicated that the aggregation observed was not the result of interaction of the hexahistidine tags, which is known to be mediated by divalent cations. 2A. Skerra, personal communication. Separation of monomeric and aggregated protein was performed on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 5 °C and a flow rate of 30 ml/h. The reaction was initiated by rapidly diluting a solution of β-helix domain denatured in Buffer A containing 6 m urea with Buffer A to the urea concentration specified and a final protein concentration of 100 μg/ml on ice and then transferring it to a water bath thermostatted at 10 °C. For each chromatographic separation, 10-μl samples were taken from the thermostatted solutions after a given period of time, diluted to 100 μl with Buffer A at the respective urea concentration and 5 °C to attenuate further aggregation, and applied to the column equilibrated in the same buffer. Eluting protein was detected using a Merck/Hitachi F-1000 spectrofluorometer with flow cell at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and an emission wavelength of 337 nm. Control experiments performed under identical conditions with solutions containing 1 mmdithioerythritol indicated that the aggregation observed was not the result of disulfide bond formation. For light microscopy, an Olympus BX60 was used. Samples were taken directly from aggregation reactions at 2m urea and 100 μg/ml protein as described above. For polarization microscopy, the same solutions were used, Congo red was added to a final concentration of 100 μm, and the samples were viewed in a Leitz Orthoplan polarization microscope with and without analyzer in search of the green birefringence known to be exhibited by amyloid-Congo red complexes (36Puchtler H.F. Sweat F. Levine M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1962; 10: 355-364Crossref Google Scholar, 37Glenner G.G. Eanes E.D. Bladen H.A. Linke R.P. Termine J.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1141-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). For electron microscopy, samples were negatively stained with aqueous uranyl acetate (38Bremer A. Henn C. Engel A. Baumeister W. Aebi U. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 46: 85-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and analyzed in a Philips CM12 electron microscope equipped with a Gatan TV system 673 and a Tietz on-line control and processing unit (39Rachel R. Jakubowski U. Tietz H. Hegerl R. Baumeister W. Ultramicroscopy. 1986; 20: 305-316Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Unfolding of the complete trimeric tailspike protein (TSP, Fig.1) is known to be irreversible at elevated denaturant concentrations (40Fuchs A. Seiderer C. Seckler R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6598-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This fact was evident from the hysteresis observed in guanidinium hydrochloride-induced folding transitions measured by tryptophan fluorescence (Fig.2). Denaturation of the trimer takes place above 2 m GdmHCl, whereas refolding of monomers starting from unfolded chains is observed only at GdmHCl concentrations below about 0.6 m, and trimer reassembly is not detected above 0.2 m GdmHCl. Removal of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of tailspike results in a reversibly folding monomeric protein, the isolated β-helix domain (Bhx), which trimerizes reversibly at high protein concentration with an association constant of 7·109m−2 (30Miller S. Schuler B. Seckler R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9160-9168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). When folding transitions in GdmHCl were performed with this fragment at low protein concentration, a striking resemblance was observed between the refolding transition of the complete protein leading to structured monomers and the superimposable unfolding and refolding transitions of the isolated β-helix domain (Fig. 2). Particularly remarkable was the coincidence of a plateau region at about 1 m GdmHCl that was found in both cases, identifying a separate state of conformation or association. Urea-induced folding transitions for Bhx, however, were observed to obey two-state behavior under otherwise identical conditions (29Schuler B. Seckler R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Assuming that the decisive factor leading to this three-state behavior was the ionic character of GdmHCl, and to be able to directly compare the data to Bhx folding transitions measured before (29Schuler B. Seckler R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Miller S. Schuler B. Seckler R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9160-9168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we attempted to simulate the conditions found in GdmHCl-induced denaturation by including sodium chloride at a concentration of 0.5 m in the solutions used for urea-induced unfolding. To test the suitability of urea plus sodium chloride for generating three-state folding transitions, unfolding and refolding transitions were measured at a Bhx concentration of 200 μg/ml, which is sufficient for determining both tryptophan fluorescence and circular dichroism reliably (Fig. 3). The respective denaturation and renaturation curves were congruent, but a drastic difference in the relative CD and fluorescence signals was observed. Whereas the ellipticity at 220 nm showed an apparent two-state transition with slightly curved pre- and post-transition base lines, a clear plateau region was observed between 2 and 3.5m urea when measuring tryptophan fluorescence. At a urea concentration of about 4 m, common transitions were detected with both signals, which were completely superimposable upon appropriate scaling of the data (Fig. 3, inset). This observation indicated the complete loss of secondary and tertiary structure at a urea concentration above 4.5 m, but it suggested that the secondary structure content was fairly constant up to this point. Although the congruence of unfolding and refolding transitions at first appeared to suggest reversibility of the folding transitions, no displacement of the two transition midpoints was found upon shifting the samples to lower temperature, which would be expected for an equilibrium process with a reaction enthalpy not equal to 0. On the other hand, a further increase of temperature lead to a broadening of the plateau, suggesting irreversible endothermic association as a possible process involved. To clarify the association state, analytical ultracentrifugation analysis of Bhx was attempted in Buffer A at a urea concentration of 2 m and 18 °C (data not shown). But the results unambiguously and repeatedly showed that a highly polydisperse population of molecules, including large, irreversibly formed aggregates, was present even at low protein concentrations, making an equilibrium analysis impossible. To slow down the aggregation process and thus be able to follow its time course by the consecutive measurement of folding transitions, the protein concentration was lowered to 10 μg/ml and the temperature to 10 °C. Fluorescence of the samples was measured aftert = 2, 24, 72, 168, and 264 h (Fig.4). Again, unfolding and refolding curves were superimposable at all times, indicating that the presumptive aggregation process was slow compared with folding/unfolding under these conditions and, consequently, that the transition reflecting thereversible folding of the protein could be obtained from the data by extrapolation to t = 0. The apparent denaturation midpoint c1/2 = 2.5 m of the folding transition resulting from such an extrapolation, which did not differ significantly from the data at t = 2 h, was identical to the value obtained from measurements without sodium chloride (29Schuler B. Seckler R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Miller S. Schuler B. Seckler R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9160-9168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). But contrary to what was found under low ionic strength conditions, a slow reduction of fluorescence intensity over time was observed at urea concentrations between about 1 and 3m, such that a quantitative analysis of the data according to an equilibrium model for folding was not possible. Division of the fluorescence values obtained after an incubation time of 264 h by those obtained after 2 h yielded a peak of the relative fluorescence change between 2.0 and 2.4 m (Fig. 4,inset), indicating aggregation to be strongest at these urea concentrations. A more detailed analysis of the aggregation process was performed using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and fluorescence detection. A solution of Bhx in 6 m urea was diluted to different urea concentrations at t = 0. Samples were taken at times between 1 min and 24 h and applied to a SEC column, and the elution profiles were measured by tryptophan fluorescence. Apparently, equilibration of Bhx folding and unfolding was sufficiently slow relative to the duration of the separation such that monomeric folded and unfolded protein and aggregates could be clearly separated and resolved as distinct peaks in the elution profiles. Although a quantification of kinetics was complicated by the polydispersity of the aggregates and the decrease in tryptophan fluorescence upon both aggregation and unfolding (cf. Figs. 3 and 4), aggregation was obviously fastest at about 2.5 m urea. Representative elution profiles obtained after incubation of the samples at a protein concentration of 100 μg/ml for 1 h at 10 °C are shown in Fig.5. Even at urea concentrations as low as 1 m, aggregation was observed, albeit at a much lower rate. Data for urea concentrations below 1 m could not be obtained because the interaction of the protein with the column matrix then drastically changed the elution profiles (data not shown). Especially at urea concentrations between 1 and 1.5 m, the formation of small oligomers could be well resolved. Their formation is irreversible on the time scale of at least 24 h as shown by reapplication of the corresponding eluted fractions onto the column (data not shown). The smallest oligomer observed elutes slightly earlier than amino-terminally shortened trimeric tailspike protein (TSPΔN, m = 180 kDa), which cannot be denatured by urea at pH 7 (17Danner M. Fuchs A. Miller S. Seckler R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and which was used as a reference at all urea concentrations investigated. But although the smallest oligomer observed almost co-eluted with trimeric TSPΔN, we assumed it to be the dimer for the following reason: if the logarithm of the degree of association were plotted versus the elution volume, a linear plot was obtained only under the assumption that the peaks observed corresponded to monomer, dimer, trimer, etc. or monomer, trimer, hexamer, etc. Extrapolation of these plots to the void volume of the column yielded a degree of oligomerization of about 13 for the first and about 65 for the second model (data not shown). Taking into account that the extrapolated exclusion limit of the column used was about 1.3·106 Da for globular proteins, the second model can be excluded, even if one assumes a globular shape of the aggregates formed. Generally, a migration of the averaged high molecular weight peak toward the void volume of the column was found during the time course of the reaction at all urea concentrations, even after almost all monomeric protein had been taken up, indicating further association of multimeric species. With increasing urea concentration, the formation of small oligomers appeared to be disfavored. Simultaneous with the appearance of multimer peaks, the area of the peaks corresponding to monomeric protein decreased with time. The congruence of denaturation and renaturation transitions (Figs. 3and 4) had already implied that the folding equilibrium was reached at all urea concentrations before aggregation started to occur to a detectable degree, i.e. that folding kinetics were much faster than the kinetics of aggregation. Folding kinetics under conditions identical to those used for SEC confirmed structure formation as measured by far-UV CD to be much faster than aggregation as measured by light scattering (data not shown) and SEC (cf. Fig. 5). Similar to TSP (40Fuchs A. Seiderer C. Seckler R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6598-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), about 75% of the total CD amplitude could not be resolved by manual mixing (dead time, 10 s), and even the use of rapid mixing methods did not allow us to resolve this phase. The second phase of folding proceeds with a rate constant of a"

The maintenance of the extracellular matrix is accomplished by a balance of synthesis and degradation, the latter being determined by the relative activities of a family of extracellular matrix proteinases, the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ME, malic enzyme; IRS, insulin response sequence.1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ME, malic enzyme; IRS, insulin response sequence. and the tissue inhibitors of MMPs (1Vincenti M.P.

However, several of the complications associated with both type I, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and type II, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, including glomerulosclerosis of the kidney (5Schleicher E.D.

Cardiol. 1995; 18: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), are also characterized, in part, by alterations in the amount and composition of extracellular matrix protein. In the streptozotocin rat model of type I diabetes, collagenase-1 (MMP-1; referred to henceforth as collagenase) gene expression in the glomerulus is decreased (10Nakamura T. Fukui M. Ebihara I. Osada S. Tomino Y. Kiode H. Renal Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 17: 316-325PubMed Google Scholar), and this would be predicted to contribute to an increase in the mesangial matrix and/or the glomerula basement membrane, one of the characteristics of glomerulosclerosis (5Schleicher E.D. Olgemoller B. Eur. J. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1992; 30: 635-640PubMed Google Scholar, 6Adler S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1994; 5: 1165-1172PubMed Google Scholar). This decrease in collagenase gene expression is reversed by insulin treatment (10Nakamura T. Fukui M. Ebihara I. Osada S. Tomino Y. Kiode H. Renal Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 17: 316-325PubMed Google Scholar), but it is unclear whether this represents a direct effect of insulin as opposed to an indirect effect mediated through changes in glucose concentration. The effect of insulin on collagenase expression in glomerula-derived cell lines has not been studied; however, in NIH 3T3 (11Medema R.H. Wubbolts R. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5963-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), Chinese hamster ovary (12Rutter G.A. White M.R.H. Tavaré J.M. Curr.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) insulin stimulates the expression of reporter genes when ligated to the collagenase promoter. Interestingly, if insulin does directly regulate collagenase gene expression in the glomerulus, then collagenase expression would actually be predicted to be increased in hyperinsulinemic individuals because the insulin resistance associated with muscle, adipose tissue, and liver may not be manifest in the kidney (14Reaven G.M. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1997; 30: 928-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). cis-Acting elements that mediate the action of insulin on gene transcription are referred to as insulin response sequences (IRSs) or elements (15O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Several IRSs have been identified, but it is apparent that a single consensus IRS does not exist (15O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Instead, it is predicted that multiple classes of consensus IRSs will be found, only three of which have currently been identified (15O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). One of these has the consensus sequence T(G/A)TTT(T/G)(T/G) and mediates the insulin-dependent transcriptional inhibition of several hepatic genes such as those encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1, tyrosine aminotransferase, apolipoprotein CIII, and glucose-6-phosphatase (16O'Brien R.M.

Stanley F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27773-27779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and the serum response element (15O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21127-21135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which mediate stimulatory effects of insulin on several genes. However, unlike the PEPCK-type IRS that confers a selective effect of insulin (15O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), the Ets motif and serum response element can mediate the effects of multiple other hormones on gene transcription (23Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 24Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). The activator protein-1 (AP-1) motif, which binds members of the Fos and Jun transcription factor families (25Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar) and, like the Ets motif and serum response element, mediates transcriptional changes in response to multiple ligands (26Karin M. Liu Z.-g. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar), may represent a fourth class of consensus IRS. Thus, Rutter et al. (12Rutter G.A. White M.R.H. Tavaré J.M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 890-899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have shown that in Chinese hamster ovary cells, mutation of the AP-1 motif in the collagenase promoter abolishes the stimulatory effect of insulin on the expression of a collagenase-luciferase fusion gene. Similarly, in rat H4IIE hepatoma cells, an AP-1 motif is required for the stimulatory effect of insulin on the expression of a malic enzyme (ME)-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion gene (13Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Ayala J.E. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Cave A. O'Brien R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, paradoxically, in HeLa cells insulin has almost no effect on ME gene transcription, whereas it markedly stimulates collagenase gene transcription (13Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Ayala J.E. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Cave A. O'Brien R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This observation raises the question as to why the AP-1 motif appears to only mediate an insulin-dependent activation of gene transcription in some cell contexts. To indirectly address this question, we have analyzed the promoter elements required for the stimulatory effect of insulin on collagenase gene transcription in HeLa cells. The results demonstrate that multiple promoter elements are required for the effect of insulin on collagenase gene transcription in addition to the AP-1 motif. However, the collagenase AP-1 motif appears to be a target of insulin signaling because it is sufficient to mediate an effect of insulin on the expression of a heterologous fusion gene. The additional collagenase promoter elements that are required for the full stimulatory effect of insulin may bind accessory factors that act to enhance the effect of insulin mediated through the AP-1 motif. The data also suggest that the mechanism of insulin and phorbol ester signaling through the collagenase-1 AP-1 motif are distinct.

Zilz N.D. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17623-17626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The noncompatible 3′HindIII-BglII junction was filled in using the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I prior to blunt-end ligation. The pCAT(An) vector has polyadenylation signals located 5′ of the polylinker to prevent read-through transcription (28Jacoby D.B. Zilz N.D. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17623-17626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control experiments demonstrated that there was no basal CAT expression and no effect of insulin or PMA when the pCAT(An) vector, minus the collagenase promoter, was transiently transfected into HeLa cells (data not shown). A series of truncated collagenase-CAT fusion genes was then generated, with the 5′ end points shown in Fig. 4, using the −518/+64 pCAT(An) construct as a template, by either restriction enzyme digestion or polymerase chain reaction, using standard techniques (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The 3′ polymerase chain reaction primer was designed to conserve the junction between the collagenase promoter and CAT reporter gene to be the same as that in all other collagenase-CAT fusion gene constructs. All promoter fragments generated by polymerase chain reaction were completely sequenced to ensure the absence of polymerase errors, whereas promoter fragments generated by restriction enzyme digestion were only sequenced to confirm the 5′ end points. Site-directed mutants of the collagenase Ets and AP-1 motifs in the context of the −97 to +64 promoter fragment, as shown in Fig. 5, were generated by polymerase chain reaction in conjunction with 5′ primers that incorporated the mutated sequence (Table I).Figure 5Site-directed mutation of the Ets and AP-1 motifs in the collagenase promoter reduces both basal collagenase-CAT fusion gene transcription and the stimulatory effects of insulin and PMA . HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” with a series of collagenase-CAT fusion genes, with 5′ deletion end points and mutations as shown on theabscissa, and expression vectors encoding β-galactosidase and the insulin receptor. Following transfection, cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of 10 nm insulin or 100 nm PMA. The cells were then harvested, and both CAT and β-galactosidase activity were assayed as described previously (20Streeper R.S. Svitek C.A. Chapman S. Greenbaum L.E. Taub R. O'Brien R.M. J. Biol.

A plasmid designated X(An) was generated by ligating a minimalXenopus 68-kDa albumin promoter (29Schorpp M. Kugler W. Wagner U. Ryffel G.U. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with the following sequence (5′-AAGCTTGATCTCTCTGAGCAATAGTATAAAACTCGAG-3′;HindIII and XhoI restriction enzyme sites underlined; TATA box in italics) intoHindIII-XhoI cleaved pCAT(An). The plasmid XMB was then generated by removing a BamHI site located just 5′ of the HindIII site by the use of mung bean nuclease. Double-stranded complementary oligonucleotides, representing various regions of the collagenase promoter (Table I), were synthesized withHindIII compatible ends and ligated intoHindIII-cleaved XMB in multiple copies. The number of inserts was determined by restriction enzyme analysis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Human HeLa cervical carcinoma cells were grown to 90% confluence in T150 flasks in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) calf serum and were replated the day before use into 55-cm2 culture dishes (1 flask to 26 dishes). Attached cells were transfected by addition of 0.5 ml of a calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitate (30O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanichkul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C. Wang J.-C. Powell D.R. Granner D.K.

After an overnight incubation the medium was removed and the cells incubated in 10 ml PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated for a further 8–24 h in 10 ml serum-free DMEM supplemented with or without various concentrations of PMA or insulin, as indicated in the Figure legends, prior to harvesting. Hamster insulinoma tumor cells were grown to 70% confluence in T150 flasks in DMEM containing 2.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 15% (v/v) horse serum and were replated the day before use into 55-cm2 culture dishes (1 flask to 14 dishes). Attached cells were then co-transfected as described previously (31Ebert D.H. Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Mathews C.E. Leiter E.H. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) by addition of 0.5 ml of a calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitate containing 15 μg of reporter plasmid DNA and expression vectors encoding β-galactosidase (2.5 μg) and the insulin receptor (5 μg) to the 10 ml of culture medium. After incubation for between 4 and 6 h, the cells were treated for 2 min with 20% glycerol in serum-free DMEM (5 ml/dish). The cells were then rinsed for 5 min with serum-free DMEM (5 ml/dish) prior to incubation for 24 h in serum-free DMEM (10 ml/dish) supplemented with or without various concentrations of insulin, as indicated in the Figure legends. Rat hepatoma H4IIE cells were grown in 12-well plates in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Attached cells were transfected at ∼60% confluence with the plasmid pCol·Luc (2 μg; Ref. 12Rutter G.A. White M.R.H. Tavaré J.M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 890-899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using 4 μl of the Tfx-50 transfection reagent (Promega) in a final volume of 400 μl serum-free DMEM, as described previously (32Dickens M.

After incubation for 2 h, the cells were then overlaid with 2 ml of serum-containing DMEM. After an overnight incubation, the cells were washed with serum-free DMEM for 2 h prior to incubation for 24 h in serum-free DMEM supplemented with or without various concentrations of insulin, as indicated in the Figure legends. Under these growth and transfection conditions 100 nm insulin was not toxic to these cells (see Fig. 2), in contrast to previous experiments in which the cells were grown in DMEM containing 2.5% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 2.5% (v/v) newborn calf serum and were transiently transfected in solution using calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation (13Streeper R.S.

Cells were either harvested by trypsin digestion and sonicated in 300 μl of 250 mm Tris (pH 7.8) containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, or for luciferase assays, cells were extracted by scraping into passive lysis buffer (Promega). CAT, β-galactosidase, and luciferase assays were performed exactly as described previously (20Streeper R.S. Svitek C.A. Chapman S. Greenbaum L.E. Taub R. O'Brien R.M. J. Biol.

To compare the relative basal CAT expression obtained with the various reporter gene constructs described, CAT activity in samples from control cells was corrected for the β-galactosidase activity in the same sample. Because phorbol esters and insulin affect Rous sarcoma virus-β galactosidase expression in HeLa cells (data not shown), CAT activity in these samples was corrected for the protein concentration in the cell lysate, as measured by the Pierce BCA assay, and each plasmid construct was analyzed in duplicate in multiple transfections, as specified in the Figure legends. Oligonucleotides representing the sense and antisense strands of the collagenase AP-1 and Ets motifs (Table I) were synthesized with BamHI or HindIII compatible ends, respectively, gel purified, annealed, and then labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the Klenow fragment ofEscherichia coli DNA polymerase I to a specific activity of approximately 2.5 μCi/pmol. HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared exactly as described previously (13Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Ayala J.E. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Cave A. O'Brien R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Labeled AP-1 oligonucleotide (∼7.5 fmol, ∼30,000 cpm) was incubated with HeLa (3 μg) nuclear extract in a final reaction volume of 20 μl containing 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.38 mm spermidine, 0.08 mm spermine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 12.5% glycerol (v/v), and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the reactants were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at room temperature for 90 min at 150 V in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris·HCl at pH 7.8, 190 mmglycine, and 1 mm EDTA. Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR5 film, and binding was analyzed by autoradiography. When the Ets oligonucleotide was used as the labeled probe, the binding conditions were identical to those described for AP-1 except that the NaCl concentration was decreased to 50 mm and poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) was reduced to 0.5 μg. In addition, visualization of specific Ets binding (see Fig.8 B) required preincubation of HeLa nuclear extract with 10 ng of chymotrypsin for 2 min at room temperature prior to addition of the labeled probe and binding buffer and a further 10 min of incubation at room temperature. Binding was then analyzed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above. For competition experiments (see Fig. 8), the indicated unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (100-fold molar excess) were mixed with the labeled oligomer prior to addition of nuclear extract. Binding was then analyzed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above. Gel supershift assays (see Fig. 9) were carried out by incubating HeLa nuclear extract (3 μg) with the indicated antisera for 10 min at room temperature, prior to the addition of the labeled AP-1 oligonucleotide probe and binding buffer and incubation for an additional 10 min. To begin to study the regulation of collagenase gene transcription by insulin, a collagenase-CAT fusion gene construct, containing collagenase promoter sequence from −518 to +64, relative to the transcription start site at +1 (33Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delius H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2256-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), was transiently transfected into HeLa cells (Fig. 1). An effect of insulin on reporter gene expression was only detected when the collagenase-CAT fusion gene was co-transfected with an expression vector encoding the insulin receptor (Fig. 1 A). In the absence of insulin, co-transfection with the insulin receptor alone was insufficient to activate collagenase-CAT fusion gene expression, suggesting a low level of signaling through the basal receptor (Fig.1 B). Stanley (34Stanley F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16719-16726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has previously shown that co-transfection with an insulin receptor expression vector is also required to observe an effect of insulin on the expression of a transiently transfected prolactin-CAT fusion gene in rat pituitary tumor GH4 cells. Interestingly, insulin stimulates the expression of the endogenous prolactin gene in these cells in the absence of receptor co-transfection (34Stanley F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16719-16726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The maximal effect of insulin on collagenase-CAT gene expression was seen at 100 nm (F"

The proteins from these three organisms have significant homology, yet differ in their temporal, spatial, and subcellular localizations. The human proteins bind the kinetochore in mitotic cells, whereas the chicken protein is found only in skeletal and cardiac muscle and is developmentally regulated. Mouse LEK1 is a single copy gene that codes for two developmentally regulated transcripts. The LEK1 protein is expressed early and ubiquitously in mouse development and is generally down-regulated as development proceeds in a manner that correlates to a cessation of mitosis. In adult tissues, the LEK1 protein is detected exclusively in the pronucleus of the oocyte and was not observed in other actively dividing tissues. Subcellular localization revealed that the LEK1 protein in mitotic cells does not bind the kinetochore. From these data, we hypothesize that chicken CMF1, human CENP-F, mitosin, and mouse LEK1 are members of an emerging family of genes that have important and functionally distinct roles in development and cell division.

CMF1 is a recently described gene whose product has been implicated in early chicken heart myogenesis. The possible function of the CMF1 gene product in the differentiation of cardiac muscle was demonstrated by disruption of CMF1 RNA function (1Wei Y. Bader B. Litvin J. Development. 1996; 122: 2779-2789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments revealed that cardiomyocytes infected with CMF1 antisense-containing retrovirus failed to express stage-appropriate markers of differentiation, whereas their uninfected or vector only-infected counterparts expressed these proteins. Data base searches for CMF1-like sequences found significant homology with CENP-F 1The abbreviations used are: CENP, centromere protein; Rb, retinoblastoma; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindold; NLS, nuclear localization signal; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified eagle medium; dpc, days post-coitum; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; dn-, dominant-negative; β-Gal, β-galactosidase.1The abbreviations used are: CENP, centromere protein; Rb, retinoblastoma; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindold; NLS, nuclear localization signal; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified eagle medium; dpc, days post-coitum; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; dn-, dominant-negative; β-Gal, β-galactosidase.and mitosin that were cloned by independent groups from human HeLa cell cDNA libraries (2Liao H.

Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5017-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The full-length CENP-F and mitosin cDNA sequences are nearly identical. Comparisons between these human cDNAs and chicken CMF1 found them 56% identical at the nucleotide level and 65% similar at the amino acid level. CENP-F was first isolated as an immunoreactive protein using antisera obtained from a patient with an autoimmune disease (4Rattner J.B. Rao A. Fritzler M.J. Valencia D.W. Yen T.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 26: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and was subsequently cloned from a HeLa cDNA expression library (2Liao H. Winkfein R.J. Rattner J.B. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The complete transcript of CENP-F codes for a large, 367-kDa protein. Antisera directed against CENP-F localize to the outer plate of the kinetochore during mitosis in dividing HeLa cells. The CENP-F protein is up-regulated in late S-phase of cell division and during prophase and metaphase localizes to paired foci near the centromere of each chromosome. During anaphase, CENP-F was found in the intercellular bridge and later, during telophase, was seen as two narrow bands on either side of the midbody. Pulse-chase experiments showed the CENP-F protein is rapidly turned over during mitosis (2Liao H. Winkfein R.J. Rattner J.B. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Recently, specific regions of the CENP-F protein have been shown to interact with another kinetochore protein, the kinesin-like motor protein, CENP-E (5Cha G.K.T. Schaar B.T. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Mitosin was originally cloned by its ability to bind the tumor suppressor protein retinoblastoma (Rb) (3Zhu X. Mancini M.A. Chang K.-H. Liu C.-Y. Chen C.-F. Shan B. Jones D. Yang-Feng T.L. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5017-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This and subsequent investigations showed mitosin to be a nuclear protein that not only binds the Rb protein but also binds microtubules, and similar to CENP-F, binds the outer plate of the kinetochore in dividing tissue culture cells (3Zhu X. Mancini M.A. Chang K.-H. Liu C.-Y. Chen C.-F. Shan B. Jones D. Yang-Feng T.L. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5017-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 6Zhu X. Chang K.-H. He D.

The intracellular localization of mitosin is nearly identical to that of CENP-F, particularly during mitosis. Recent studies have shown that mitosin is capable of binding a putative cytoplasmic retention protein, BRAP2 (7Li S. Ku C.Y. Farmer A.A. Cong Y.S. Chen C.F. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6183-6189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). CENP-F and mitosin have both been associated with a number of human disorders such as chronic graftversus host disease and various neoplasias (8Landberg G. Erlanson M. Roos G. Tan E.M. Casiano C.A.

Taken together, these studies led to the hypothesis that CENP-F/mitosin has an essential role in mitotic cell division. Previous data demonstrate the complexity of this emerging gene family. Several basic questions concerning the structure, expression, and function of the CENP/mitosin proteins remain unanswered. In an effort to understand the role of this gene family in development, we sought to clone gene products related to CENP/mitosin and CMF1 in mice, characterize the expression of their mRNAs and proteins, and initiate analysis of function. We have isolated a novel gene product, LEK1, that has many structural elements shared with CENP-F/mitosin and CMF1. Still, analysis of LEK1 expression and subcellular distributionin vivo suggests that it has a distinct role in mitosis and cell differentiation. In addition, overexpression of a dominant-negative form of LEK1 accelerated differentiation of a myogenic cell line, suggesting a novel function for LEK1 among CENP-F/mitosin-related proteins. Taken together, our data suggest that LEK1 is a novel member of this emerging gene family. The Access RT-PCR system (Promega) was used to amplify cDNAs from 100 ng of 9.5-dpc total ICR (Harlan Sprague-Dawley) mouse heart RNA using two sets of degenerate primers (5′-GGCTNCCAGAAGTNGTTAAA-3′ and 5′-CTTTTGTGATNTGCTGCCACC-3′, 5′-TTAYATGAWCAGCACTGT-3′, and 5′-TTCCTYAKTTTTCATAWTCYCTTG-3′) from two homologous regions between chicken CMF1 and CENP-F/mitosin. These cDNA fragments were then cloned into the T-easy vector (Promega) and sequenced using an ABI Prism Genetic Analyzer (Perkin-Elmer). Inserts from these clones were then used as probes to screen a whole embryo 8.5-dpc mouse cDNA library (courtesy of the laboratory of Dr. B. L. M. Hogan). Overlapping clones were obtained by using standard protocols for cDNA library screening, RT-PCR cloning, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and Genewalking (13Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar) and sequenced as stated above. Using standard protocols (13Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar), 10 μg of mouse, human, and chicken genomic DNA were digested with the indicated (Fig. 2) restriction endonuclease overnight at 37 °C as per the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). This DNA was processed for Southern blot analysis. The blot was then prehybridized in RapidHyb (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 65 °C. A probe corresponding to 7017–7222 nucleotides of the LEK1 transcript random prime-labeled with 50 μCi of [α 32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This probe was then hybridized to the genomic blot overnight at 65 °C. The blot was first washed three times in 2× SSC (sodium chloride (150 mm) and sodium citrate (15 mm), pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS for 1 h/wash at 55 °C and exposed overnight using Biomax intensifying screen and Biomax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). This washing and exposure protocol was repeated at 60 and 65 °C. All counts were stripped from the blot with boiling 0.05% SDS. It was then reprobed with the corresponding of region of the chicken CMF1 transcript in a similar manner as noted above. Staged embryonic and adult tissues were collected, and the total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). 10 μgs of total RNA was electrophoresed on a denaturing 1% agarose, 2.2m formaldehyde gel and visualized with ethidium bromide as a loading control. The RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane via capillary action overnight and UV-cross-linked. This blot was probed with the same region of the mouse LEK1 cDNA as the mouse-probed Southern above, using the same hybridization conditions. The blot was then washed three times at 65 °C in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 h/wash and exposed overnight using a Biomax intensifying screen and Biomax film (Kodak). Adult and staged embryonic tissues were processed for cryo-sectioning using a Jung CM 3000 cryostat (Leica) in 10-μm increments and collected on gelatin-coated slides. The slides were then fixed with 70% methanol for 10 min, permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. Affinity-purified anti-LEK1 (Biosynthesis) was incubated with these samples for 1 h at room temperature using a 1:800 dilution. After extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline, slides were incubated in donkey anti-rabbit Cy3 (The Jackson Laboratory) and DAPI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) counterstain at room temperature for 1 h and again washed extensively in phosphate-buffered saline. These samples were visualized using fluorescence microscopy (Olympus). Controls for these experiments included no primary antibody and peptide competition. In both cases, staining was completely absent. The 9.5-dpc limb bud in Fig. 4 was obtained using a confocal laser-scanning LSM410 microscope (Zeiss) on tissues prepared in a similar fashion as stated above. The nuclear marker YoPro-1 (Molecular Probes) was used in these experiments because of incapability of DAPI with this microscope. C2C12 cells (ATCC) were passaged once in 20% fetal bovine serum in DMEM. 5 × 106 cells were placed into single-well chamber slides. Myotubes were induced to form by growing cells in 4% heat-inactivated horse serum in DMEM for 4 days. Mitotically active C2C12 cells were maintained in 20% fetal bovine serum in DMEM for this same time period. These slides were processed and analyzed in an identical manner to the mouse tissues above. A dominant-negative LEK1 (dnLEK1) construct was produced by cloning 4.49 kilobases of the 3′-most cDNA sequence of the LEK1 into the mammalian expression vector pCI Neo (Promega). This protein is missing the N-terminal half of LEK1. A similar dominant-negative of mitosin produced marked phenotypic changes when transfected into human fibroblasts (3Zhu X. Mancini M.A. Chang K.-H. Liu C.-Y. Chen C.-F. Shan B. Jones D. Yang-Feng T.L. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5017-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Preliminary analysis demonstrated that this construct produces the expected dnLEK1 protein of the predicted size with the same subcellular distribution as the native protein. 2L. M. Pabón-Peña and D. Bader, unpublished results. For transfection, C2C12 cells were grown to approximately 75% confluence in 20% fetal bovine serum in DMEM. These cells were transfected with either 5 μg of the dnLEK1 and 200 ng of pβ-Gal, 5 μgs of the control pCI Neo vector, and 200 ngs of pβ-Gal or no DNA using Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as per the manufacturer's instructions. These plates were grown in 20% fetal bovine serum DMEM for 24 h. The media was then changed to differentiation media (4% heat-inactivated horse serum) to promote myogenesis. Cells were maintained in this media for 3 days, at which time the plates were stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside using the manufacturer's instructions provided in the β-Gal kit (Invitrogen). Blue-staining cells were counted and scored as single cells or differentiated myotubes in control and experimental groups. Transfection data was analyzed by two-sided χ2 methods with a significance level set at p < 0.05. Standard low stringency hybridization techniques were initially employed to isolate the murine CMF1 gene (13Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). A number of libraries (genomic and cDNA) and hybridization conditions were assayed, none of which produced clones. Consequently, an RT-PCR cloning strategy was developed using two homologous regions between the chicken CMF1 and human CENP-F/mitosin proteins to design degenerate primers (see “Experimental Procedures”). These degenerate primers were used to amplify cDNAs from heart RNA of 9.5-dpc mouse embryos. To obtain larger regions of this mouse transcript, the RT-PCR clones were then used as probes to screen an 8.5-dpc whole embryo library (courtesy of Dr. B. L. M. Hogan). The resulting cDNAs were subsequently cloned and sequenced and found to be approximately 75% identical to the human CENP-F/mitosin cDNAs. A combination of RT-PCR, cDNA cloning, genomic walking, and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends techniques were used to isolate overlapping clones such that the primary structure of the LEK1 transcript could be determined. It should be noted that an antiserum (described below) was developed against a sequence from one of the cDNA clones. Subsequently, this antiserum was used to reclone LEK1, 3R. L. Goodwin, L. M. Pabón-Peña, G. C. Foster, and D. Bader, data not shown. demonstrating the specificity of this antibody. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences of chicken CMF1, human CENP-F/mitosin, and mouse LEK1 shows that mouse LEK1 is more closely related to human CENP-F/mitosin than to chicken CMF1. CMF1, CENP-F/mitosin, and LEK1 proteins share a significant amount of homology at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. A prominent feature of these proteins is a preponderance of leucine (L), glutamic acid (E), and lysine (K) amino acid residues in these proteins, approximately 40% of the amino acid composition. Thus, we have named the mouse cDNA LEK1 and tentatively refer to these three proteins as the LEK family of genes. Like CMF1 (1Wei Y. Bader B. Litvin J. Development. 1996; 122: 2779-2789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and CENP-F/mitosin (2Liao H. Winkfein R.J. Rattner J.B. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 3Zhu X. Mancini M.A. Chang K.-H. Liu C.-Y. Chen C.-F. Shan B. Jones D. Yang-Feng T.L. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell.

Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) predicts that the LEK1 protein is largely composed of α-helices separated by turns except for the proline-rich, globular C terminus. A number of these α-helices are perfect leucine zippers, whereas others have aliphatic heptad repeats. These secondary structures have been shown to be important mediators of both protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions (15Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (2534) Google Scholar, 16O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Stafford III, W.F. Kim P.F. Science. 1989; 245: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 17Busch S.J. Sassone-Corsi P. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 36-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The number and general positions of the leucine zippers (Fig. 1, blue ovals) are conserved among these proteins. Another shared feature of the three proteins is their predicted tertiary structures. Using the Coiledcoil program (14Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), the α-helices of the LEK1 protein are predicted to fold into four coiled coils with intervening turns or loops. Mouse LEK1 protein shares a number of other protein motifs with CENP-F/mitosin and CMF1. As would be expected with such large proteins, there are a number of conserved, potential sites for post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, myristylation, and amidation. The most conserved region among the human, mouse, and chicken proteins is the C terminus (Fig. 1.) In this region, the LEK1 protein contains a predicted helix-loop-helix dimerization domain (Fig.1, asterisk), a bipartite nuclear localization signal (Fig.1, yellow stripe and bracketed) (18Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar), an atypical Rb binding site (Fig. 1, black stripe andbracketed) (3Zhu X. Mancini M.A. Chang K.-H. Liu C.-Y. Chen C.-F. Shan B. Jones D. Yang-Feng T.L. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5017-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and a P-loop, which is an ATP/GTP binding domain (Fig. 1, bracketed). These motifs are not only well conserved between the three different proteins but are distributed in a collinear fashion (Fig. 1). Though these proteins do share these abundant similarities, it is important to note that comparisons between them do have regions of significant divergence. A Southern blot analysis of mice, human, and chicken genomic DNA was conducted to investigate the number of potential LEK1-like genes in the genomes of other representative vertebrates. Mouse, human, and chicken genomic DNAs were probed with the well conserved 3′ region of the LEK1 cDNA. At low stringency conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”), numerous bands were observed in all species.3 By gradually increasing the stringency of the washes, the number and intensity of bands decreased until at 65 °C and 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, only a single band/lane was observed (Fig.2 A). When this same blot was stripped and reprobed with a corresponding region of the chicken CMF1 cDNA, single bands were also observed (Fig. 2 B), although their migration differed from those in the mouse-probed Southern blot (compare the arrows in Fig. 2, Aand B). Interestingly, bands with similar mobility were observed in a low stringency wash of the mouse-probed Southern.3 This is consistent with the hypothesis that two homologous genes exist in these organisms, a CMF1-like and a LEK1-like gene. To determine both the size and the temporal/spatial distribution of LEK1 transcripts in the murine tissues, Northern analysis experiments were performed. RNA was extracted from staged mouse embryonic and adult tissues. As seen in Fig. 3 A, two bands (approximately 10 kilobases) hybridized to the same well conserved sequence used in the Southern analysis. These two transcripts are most likely the result of alternative products from a single gene as only one band was observed in the Southern blot experiments using the same probe and high stringency conditions. The highest levels of LEK1 expression were observed in the early stages of mouse development: 8.5-dpc whole embryo, 9.5-dpc head, and 9.5-dpc caudal regions posterior to the heart (Fig. 3 A). It is interesting to note that the relative levels of the LEK1 message appeared to increase during the course of embryonic murine heart and liver development. In other tissues, such as the developing head and brain, the abundance of the LEK1 transcripts decreased with the age of the embryo (Fig.3 A). Because LEK1-like proteins such as CENP-F and mitosin have been implicated in the mitotic process in vitro, we explored the expression of LEK1 in the developing heart, where the time course of mitotic activity is well documented (19Soonpaa M.H. Kim K.K. Pajak L. Franklin M. Field L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H2183-H2189PubMed Google Scholar, 20Soonpaa M.H. Field L.J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Using a Northern blot kindly provided by the laboratory of Dr. Loren Field, we determined the temporal expression of LEK1 in the developing mouse heart. High levels of expression were found in 14-dpc embryonic mouse hearts (Fig.3 B) and continued through 4 days postpartum (Fig.3 B, N4). Little if any expression was observed in the 7-day-old mouse, and a low yet detectable level of LEK1 expression was observed in the adult mouse heart. The previous RNA data suggested that the LEK1 message is widely distributed in the early embryo, but its expression drops as development proceeds (Fig.3 A). To determine the localization of LEK1 protein during embryogenesis, we generated an affinity-purified antibody against LEK1. As seen in Fig. 4, the vast majority of cells in this 9.5-dpc limb bud have LEK1-positive nuclei, although some cells are negative (arrows in Fig. 4). The definitive ectoderm and mesoderm in this tissue are examples of the extensive expression pattern of LEK1 in early embryonic nuclei regardless of germ layer origin. As tissues differentiated, we found a general decrease in LEK1-positive nuclei. The general pattern of LEK1 expression coincides with the loss of mitotic activity in the early embryo. Because LEK1 mRNA expression is down-regulated in the developing mouse heart at a time when cardiomyocytes cease nuclear division (19Soonpaa M.H. Kim K.K. Pajak L. Franklin M. Field L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H2183-H2189PubMed Google Scholar, 20Soonpaa M.H. Field L.J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), we investigated the distribution of the LEK1 protein in this organ using immunohistochemical analysis. The majority of the nuclei in early embryonic hearts were found to be LEK1-positive (compare LEK1 Ab and DAPI counterstain in 16.5-dpc heart in Fig.5). This pattern dramatically changed between the N5 and N7 time points (Fig. 5). During this interval, the number of LEK-positive nuclei dropped from 90% to less than 10%. Thus, LEK1 is developmentally regulated at both the mRNA and protein levels at this critical time in heart development. The low level of LEK1-positive nuclei seen in N7 is maintained in N21 mouse hearts and remains low in adult hearts.3 A survey of adult organs and tissues was conducted to determine the pattern of LEK1 protein expression in differentiated tissues. Only rare cells were observed to have LEK1-positive nuclei. Interestingly, LEK1 was not observed in skin and intestinal epithelia, where cell renewal via mitosis is common.3 In fact, in all of the adult tissues examined thus far, LEK1 has only been found in the pronucleus of the oocyte in the mouse ovary (Fig. 6). However, no LEK1-positive pronuclei are observed in mature sperm cells or any other cells in the seminiferous tubules of the testes (Fig.6).Figure 6Localization of the LEK1 protein in adult gonads. Mouse adult gonads were cryo-sectioned and stained with anti-LEK1 and counterstained with DAPI. The pronucleus of the oocyte stained prominently, whereas the pronucleus of mature sperm were LEK1-negative.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) CENP-F and mitosin have been implicated in the mechanical/structural aspects mitosis (2Liao H.

Our current study found a correlation between the loss of mitotic activity during development and the down-regulation of the LEK1 protein (Fig.5). However, this correlation was not maintained in differentiated actively dividing cells of the adult mouse (testes in Fig. 6). To investigate the localization of the LEK1 protein in a system where the process of differentiation can be controlled, we employed the mouse skeletal myogenic cell line C2C12. These cells can be maintained as actively dividing cells in mitogen-rich medium or induced to form mitotically inactive, multinucleated myotubes in differentiation medium (22Sliberstein L. Webster S.G. Travis M. Blau H.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 1075-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 23Jahn L. Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Exp.

As shown in Fig. 7, nuclei of individual C2C12 cells were stained with anti-LEK1. Over 95% of mononucleated C2C12 cells had LEK1-positive nuclei (compare red fluorescence with DAPI counterstain, Fig. 7, B andC). There is some minor LEK1 staining in the cytoplasm of some cells. In mitotic cells, the LEK1 protein (Fig.8) is present in all parts of the cell as the nuclear envelope breaks down in prophase (Fig. 8, column1). At metaphase and anaphase (Fig. 8, columns 2and 3), the LEK1 protein remains fully cytoplasmic but is absent in the area of the condensed chromosomes as determined by counterstaining with DAPI (Fig. 8). At cytokinesis, the LEK1 protein is localized to an area that is slightly greater than the DAPI-staining region (Fig. 8, last column(Myotube)). With the fusion of C2C12 into myotubes, DNA synthesis and mitosis abruptly stops, and the cells enter Go (25Andres V. Walsh K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 8, there are LEK1-positive nuclei present in differentiated myotubes (compare LEK1 Ab and DAPI in the myotube), and increased cytoplasmic staining is observed. Later, however, LEK1 is absent in differentiated C2C12 myofibers. 4M. E. Dees, R. L. Goodwin, and D. Bader, manuscript in preparation. Thus, there is no sharp boundary of LEK1 protein expression as these cells are exiting the cell cycle. This pattern of LEK1 protein localization contrasts with previously published reports for both CENP-F and mitosin in mitotic cells (2Liao H. Winkfein R.J. Rat"
https://openalex.org/W1989756833,"Ionizing radiation is known to activate multiple signal transduction pathways, but the targets of these pathways are poorly understood. Phosphorylation of histone H1 is thought to have a role in chromatin condensation/decondensation, and we asked whether ionizing radiation (IR) would alter H1 phosphorylation. Our data demonstrate that low doses of IR result in a dramatic, but transient, dephosphorylation of H1 isoforms. The in vivo IR-induced dephosphorylation of H1 is completely blocked by wortmannin and is abrogated in ataxia telangiectasia cells. Furthermore, we measured radiation-induced inhibition of cyclin dependent kinase activity and activation of histone H1 phosphatase activity. Both activities were affected by radiation-induced signals in an ATM-dependent manner. Thus, the rapid IR-induced dephosphorylation of H1 involves a pathway including ATM and a wortmannin-sensitive step leading to both inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase activities as well as activation of H1 phosphatase(s)."

To examine the relationship between the Grb2-SOS complex and Ras activation, we observed that insulin stimulation results in a rapid but transient activation of Ras and the extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) followed by dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex. Although treatment with the phorbol myristate acetate resulted in ERK activation and complete dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex, there was no effect on subsequent insulin-stimulated Ras activation. Similarly, insulin stimulation followed by insulin removal resulted in a time-dependent restoration of the Grb2-SOS complex but which was significantly slower than the recovery of insulin-stimulated Ras activation. In addition, although insulin was able to activate Ras under these conditions, there was a complete desensitization of Raf and ERK activation. This apparent homologous desensitization of insulin action was specific for Raf and ERK as the insulin re-stimulation of insulin receptor autophosphorylation and protein kinase B activation were unaffected. Together, these data demonstrate the presence of a pathway independent of the Grb2-SOS complex that can lead to Ras activation but that the desensitization of Raf accounts for the homologous desensitization of ERK.

The formation of the Shc-Grb2-SOS and IRS-Grb2-SOS ternary complexes are thought to result in the conversion of the inactive GDP-bound Ras to the active GTP-bound state (12Baltensperger K. Kozma L.M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22231-22234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once in the activated GTP-bound state, Ras associates with members of the Raf family of serine/threonine kinases (17Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar, 18Warne P.H. Viciana P.R. Downward J. Nature. 1993; 364: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In turn, activated Raf functions as an upstream kinase for the dual specificity kinase MEK which phosphorylates and stimulates ERK activity providing an important bifurcation point for the regulation of metabolic, transcriptional, and mitogenic events (19Yuryev A. Wennogle L.P. Cell Res. 1998; 8: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). Thus, in this pathway Ras functions as a molecular switch converting tyrosine kinase signals into a serine/threonine kinase cascade. Although this potential mechanism for Ras activation is quite appealing, there are several lines of evidence suggesting that the Grb2-SOS complex may not necessarily be required for Ras activation. In the case of R7 cell development in Drosophila, expression of a carboxyl-terminal SOS deletion, which cannot bind the Grb2 homologue Drk, is sufficient to rescue the SOS null phenotype (21Karlovich C.A. Bonfini L. McCollam L. Rogge R.D. Daga A. Czech M.P. Banerjee U. Science. 1995; 268: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Similarly, constitutive expression of SOS can induce downstream signaling and cellular transformation in the absence of Grb2 binding (22Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. Al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J.

Genet. 1995; 10: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is also substantial evidence supporting a positive functional role for the Grb2-SOS complex; for example, point mutations in the Grb2 SH3 domain which prevent binding to SOS impairs vulval development in Caenorhabditis elegans (26Clark S.G.

In addition, Ras inactivation directly correlates with the dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex, and endothelin activation/inactivation of Ras in messangial cells was temporally dependent upon the association state of the Grb2-SOS complex (27Langlois W.J.

Based upon these data, we have examined the relationship between the Grb2-SOS association state directly with that of Ras activation and downstream signaling events. In this study we have observed that PMA pretreatment induces a complete dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex without any significant activation of Ras. Despite the loss of the Grb2-SOS complex, insulin remains fully competent in the conversion of Ras from the inactive GDP to the GTP-bound state. Similarly, uncoupling of the Grb2-SOS complex by acute insulin stimulation only partially reduces the activation of Ras by a second round of acute insulin stimulation. In contrast, the homologous desensitization of ERK activation parallels the inability of insulin to re-activate Raf. Together, these data demonstrate that the Grb2-SOS complex is not absolutely essential for the activation of Ras, which likely occurs through alternative mechanisms. Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human insulin receptor (CHO/IR) were maintained and cultured in minimum Eagle's medium-α supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin plus 20 mmglutamine as described previously (32Waters S.B.

The cells were incubated in serum-free medium at 37 °C for 6 h prior to hormone addition as indicated in the figure legends. In some cases following initial insulin treatment, the cells were rapidly washed in a low pH buffer (5 mm sodium acetate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 5.0) to remove the extracellular and cell surface-bound insulin. The cells were then allowed to recover in serum-free media for various periods followed by a second round of hormone stimulation as described in the individual figure legends. The reactions were stopped by rapid aspiration of the medium and snap freezing the cells with liquid nitrogen. The frozen cells were stored at −80 °C until use. Whole cell detergent lysates were prepared by thawing cells in a lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mmsodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm pepstatin, 0.5 trypsin inhibitory units of aprotinin, and 10 mm leupeptin) for 30 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C, and the total protein in the supernatant was determined by the method of Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were incubated with a polyclonal Grb2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and immune complexes were precipitated by incubation with protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described previously (32Waters S.B. Chen D. Kao A.W. Okada S. Holt K.H. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18224-18230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Samples for immunoblotting were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl), resuspended in SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4% (w/v) SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue), and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Whole cell detergent extracts, GST-RBD affinity precipitates, and antibody immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The samples were immunoblotted with either a monoclonal Grb2 (Transduction Laboratories), monoclonal ERK (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), polyclonal phospho-Akt (New England Biolabs), monoclonal phosphotyrosine (PY20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal Ras (Transduction Laboratories), or monoclonal SOS (Transduction Laboratories) antibodies. The primary monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies (except PY20-HRP) were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) and visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This assay is based on the fact that only activated Ras (Ras-GTP) is capable of binding to Raf-1 Ras binding domain (RBD); therefore, associated Ras proteins reflect the fraction of activated Ras molecules. A cDNA encoding for a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) Raf-1 binding domain (RBD) fusion protein (GST-RBD) was kindly provided by Dr. David Shalloway (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). This fusion protein was used to precipitate specifically according to the method of Taylor and Shalloway (34Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Briefly, the GST-RBD bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (20 μg, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was incubated with 2 mg of whole cell detergent lysates for 1 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer followed by solubilization and resuspension in Laemmli sample buffer and separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. Raf protein kinase activity was determined by an immunocomplex protein kinase cascade assay using exogenous substrates according to the manufacturer's specifications (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Briefly, clarified supernatants were incubated with an anti-Raf antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and protein G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or protein G-Sepharose alone, for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were washed three times in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5 mmsodium vanadate, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm pepstatin, 0.5 trypsin inhibitory units of aprotinin, and 10 mm leupeptin) and once with kinase dilution buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The washed precipitates were incubated with inactive fusion proteins GST-MEK1 (0.4 μg) and GST-p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (0.1 μg), 150 μm ATP, and 20 μm magnesium chloride, at room temperature with gentle agitation, after which a portion of each sample was incubated with 20 μg of myelin basic protein and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 10 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. Samples were transferred onto p81 phosphocellulose squares (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), washed 3 times in 0.75% phosphoric acid, twice with acetone, and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Previous studies have observed that agents that activate the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway can also induce the serine/threonine phosphorylation of SOS and dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex (29Waters S.B.

The dissociation of Grb2 from SOS has been postulated to be one mechanism that may be responsible for the transient nature of Ras activation and for the homologous desensitization of Ras activation by insulin (27Langlois W.J.

To compare the effects of heterologous stimulation on SOS phosphorylation and its association with Grb2, we incubated CHO/IR cells with 100 nm insulin or 100 nm PMA for various times (Fig.1). Consistent with previous findings (27Langlois W.J. Sasaoka T. Saltiel A.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol.

Furthermore, following 5 min of insulin stimulation there was a marked reduction in the amount of SOS that was co-immunoprecipitated with Grb2 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and2). Similar to insulin, PMA treatment resulted in a time-dependent decrease in SOS mobility (Fig.1 A, lanes 3–7) that correlated with the time-dependent decrease in the amount of SOS that was co-immunoprecipitated with Grb2 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3–7). The addition of insulin for 5 min following PMA pretreatment had no further effect on SOS mobility or on the co-immunoprecipitation of SOS with Grb2 (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 8–10). As a control, the immunoprecipitates were also subjected to Grb2 immunoblotting to confirm equal amounts of Grb2 were immunoprecipitated under these conditions (Fig. 1 B, bottom panel). In addition, insulin and PMA stimulation also resulted in the activation of ERK as detected by its decrease in electrophoretic mobility characteristic of threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel, lanes 1–7). PMA pretreatment followed by 5 min of insulin stimulation slightly enhanced the activation of ERK relative to PMA alone (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel, lanes 8–10). These data indicated that under conditions in which the Grb2-SOS complex was completely dissociated (PMA pretreatment), insulin was still capable of activating ERK. Several lines of evidence have implicated the Grb2-SOS complex as a major pathway for the activation of Ras and its downstream effectors (5Skolnik E.Y. Batzer A. Li N. Lee C.H. Lowenstein E.

We therefore directly examined the relationship between the Grb2-SOS complex and Ras activation (Fig. 2). To assess Ras activation, we took advantage of the ability of GTP-bound Ras to associate with a GST fusion protein containing the Ras binding domain of Raf (GST-RBD). This assay has recently been demonstrated to reflect specifically the amount of Ras in the active GTP-bound state (30Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 34Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). As previously observed using [32P]GTP loading assays, insulin stimulation resulted in the characteristic time-dependent Ras activation/inactivation cycle (Fig.2 A, lanes 1–5). Maximal Ras activation occurred 3–5 min in the continuous presence of insulin stimulation and gradually returned toward the GDP-bound inactive state. Consistent with Ras functioning upstream of ERK, the insulin activation of ERK paralleled the transient change in Ras activation (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–5). In contrast, PMA treatment had a marginal effect on Ras activation which did not appear to be time-dependent (Fig.2 A, lanes 6–9). Nevertheless, PMA stimulation resulted in a more persistent activation of ERK consistent with PMA activating the ERK pathway downstream or in parallel to Ras (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6–9). Surprisingly, however, 30 min of PMA pretreatment had no effect on the ability of insulin to stimulate Ras activation (Fig.2 A, lane 10). This occurred despite the complete PMA-induced dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex under these conditions (Fig. 1). Furthermore, insulin stimulation following pretreatment with PMA increased the extent of ERK activation (Fig. 2 B, lane 10). Together, these data suggest that insulin can activate Ras independent of the Grb2-SOS association state. Similar to PMA, osmotic shock does not activate Ras but is a potent stimulator of ERK and induces the phosphorylation of SOS and dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex (36Chen D. Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6328-6332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used osmotic shock treatment as an additional mechanism to examine the relationship between the Grb2-SOS complex and Ras activation (Fig.3). As expected, insulin stimulation resulted in the typical decrease in SOS electrophoretic mobility and activation of ERK (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and 2). Similarly, stimulation of the cells by both PMA and osmotic shock also resulted in the phosphorylation of SOS and activation of ERK (Fig.3 A, lanes 3–6). Although osmotic shock did induce a broadening and a decrease in SOS mobility, its effect was not as large as that observed by insulin or PMA treatment. Nevertheless, stimulation of the cells with all three stimuli (insulin, PMA, and osmotic shock) induced a dissociation of Grb2 from SOS (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–6). In comparison, insulin stimulation resulted in a marked activation of Ras, whereas PMA and osmotic treatment were without effect (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1–3 and 5). As previously observed (Fig. 2), despite the dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex in the PMA-stimulated cells, subsequent insulin stimulation resulted in the activation of Ras (Fig. 3 C, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, osmotic shock, which also induced the dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex (Fig. 3 B), prevented the subsequent insulin stimulation of Ras activation (Fig. 3 C, lanes 5 and6). These data demonstrate that the heterologous desensitization of Ras activation is agonist-dependent and under certain conditions can appear to directly correlate with the Grb2-SOS association state. It has been previously reported that insulin stimulation results in the homologous desensitization of downstream signaling events (28Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Conway B.R. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1485-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 31Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Ross S.E. Syu L.J. Guan K.L. Saltiel A.R. Koretzky G.A. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

To investigate further the desensitization of insulin signaling, we directly investigated the effect of homologous hormone treatment on SOS phosphorylation, Grb2-SOS association, Ras and ERK activation. To mimic the pulsatile nature of insulin exposure that occurs in vivo, we incubated the cells for 15 min with insulin followed by a rapid acidic wash to remove the free and cell surface-bound insulin and then allowed the cells to recover for various times in serum-free media (Fig.4). As is apparent, insulin stimulation for up to 15 min resulted in a time-dependent phosphorylation of SOS, activation of ERK, and dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 1–5). Removal of insulin at 15 min resulted in a slower time-dependent dephosphorylation of SOS which returned to basal state within 120–240 min (Fig. 4 A, lanes 6–11). Since ERK activation is transient even in the continuous presence of insulin, there was a more rapid recovery of ERK back to the basal state. In any case, there was a return of the Grb2-SOS complex that was fully recovered by 240 min and which directly paralleled the dephosphorylation of SOS (Fig. 4 B, lanes 6–11). By having determined the time frame for the recovery of the Grb2-SOS complex following insulin-stimulated dissociation, we next examined the ability of insulin to re-stimulate the dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex and to re-activate ERK (Fig. 5). In these studies, cells were treated with insulin for up to 10 min; the insulin was removed by a rapid low pH wash, and the cells were recovered for various times followed by a second 3-min insulin stimulation. As expected, insulin stimulation resulted in a time-dependent phosphorylation of SOS and activation of ERK (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1–3). Following insulin removal, there was a slow time-dependent dephosphorylation of SOS, with a more rapid inactivation of ERK (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4, 6, 8, and10). However, 30 min subsequent to the insulin washout, a second acute insulin stimulation was unable to induce the phosphorylation of SOS or the activation of ERK (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4 and 5). Similarly, 60 min after insulin washout, an acute insulin stimulation still had no effect on either SOS phosphorylation or ERK activation (Fig. 5 A, lanes 6 and7). In contrast, 120 min subsequent to insulin washout there was a partial restoration of acute insulin-stimulated SOS phosphorylation and ERK activation which fully recovered by 240 min following the initial insulin washout (Fig. 5 A, lanes 8–11). In parallel, insulin stimulation resulted in the dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex, which remained dissociated for up to 60 min following insulin washout (Fig. 5 C, lanes 1–6). As observed for SOS phosphorylation, 120 min following the insulin washout there was a partial recovery of the Grb2-SOS complex which was fully reassociated by 240 min (Fig. 5 C, lanes 7 and9). At these time points, the recovery of insulin-stimulated SOS phosphorylation directly correlated with the ability of acute insulin stimulation to induce a second round of Grb2-SOS dissociation (Fig. 5 C, lanes 8 and 10). These data demonstrate that subsequent to insulin stimulation and removal, there is a 120-min refractory period before the Grb2-SOS complex can reassemble that parallels the ability of insulin to re-stimulated SOS phosphorylation and ERK activation. Since PMA pretreatment was able to induce the dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex but did not induce heterologous desensitization of Ras activation to insulin stimulation, we next determined if insulin can induce homologous desensitization of Ras to a second bolus of insulin stimulation. Consistent with our previous observations, insulin stimulation resulted in a transient activation of Ras with a marked activation at 3 min followed by a decline to near basal levels by 10 min (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1–3). There was a small but further slow return of Ras to the GDP-bound state following insulin removal over a 30 to 240-min time period (Fig. 5 B, lanes 4, 6, 8,and 10). However, followin"
https://openalex.org/W2004108964,"We determined the complete nucleotide sequences of the α1 subunit gene (OlGCS-α 1) and the β1 subunit gene (OlGCS-β 1) of medaka fish soluble guanylyl cyclase. In the genome, OlGCS-α 1 andOlGCS-β 1 are organized in tandem. The two genes are only 986 base pairs apart and span approximately 34 kilobase pairs in the order of OlGCS-α 1 andOlGCS-β 1. The nucleotide sequence of a large part of the 5′-upstream region of OlGCS-α 1 is complimentarily conserved in that ofOlGCS-β 1. To analyze the promoter activity of each gene, a fusion gene construct in which the 5′-upstream region was fused with the green fluorescent protein gene was injected into medaka fish 2-cell embryos. When the fusion gene containing theOlGCS-α 1 upstream region was injected, green fluorescent protein fluorescence was detected in the embryonic brain. The 5′-upstream region ofOlGCS-β 1alone was insufficient for the reporter gene expression in the embryos. When the OlGCS-α 1 upstream region was located upstream of the OlGCS-β 1-green fluorescence protein fusion gene, the reporter gene was expressed in the brain and trunk region of the embryos. These results suggest that the 5′-upstream region ofOlGCS-α 1 can affect the expression of OlGCS-β 1. It is therefore possible that the expression ofOlGCS-α 1 andOlGCS-β 1 is coordinated.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that the β2 subunit inhibits activation of the α1/β1 heterodimer by NO (15Gupta G. Azam M. Yang L. Danziger R.S. J. Clin.

In vasodilation, soluble GC activated by NO derived from the endothelium induces relaxation of vascular smooth muscle through cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (1Drewett J.G. Garbers D.L. Endocr.

Nature. 1997; 390: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The NO/cGMP signaling pathway is also expected to participate in synaptogenesis (22Truman J.W. De Vente J. Ball E.E. Development. 1996; 122: 3949-3958PubMed Google Scholar) and synaptic suppression in a neuromuscular junction (23Wang T. Xie Z. Lu B. Nature. 1995; 374: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Despite the rapid accumulation of information concerning the functional importance of the NO/cGMP signaling pathway, there have been only a few reports related to the regulation of the soluble GC gene expression. It has been demonstrated that cAMP causes decreases in the level of mRNA for β1 subunits of soluble GC in the rat fetal lung fibroblast (24Shimouchi A. Janssens S.P. Bloch D.B. Zapol W.M. Bloch K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L456-L461PubMed Google Scholar) and for both subunits of soluble GC in the rat aortic smooth muscle cell (25Papapetropoulos A. Marczin N. Mora G. Milici A. Murad F. Catravas J.D. Hypertension. 1995; 26: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The α1 and β1 subunit genes of soluble GC are colocalized in human and rat chromosomes (26Giuili G. Roechel N. Scholl U. Mattei M.-G. Guellaën G. Hum. Genet. 1993; 91: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Azam M. Gupta G. Chen W. Wellington S. Warburton D. Danziger R.S. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This and the fact that the coexpression of both subunits is essential for enzyme activity imply that the expression of both genes is coordinated. However, there has been no report on the genomic structure and transcriptional regulation of soluble GC. Recently, we have isolated cDNA clones encoding the α1 subunit (OlGCS-α 1) and β1 subunit (OlGCS-β 1) of soluble GC of the medaka fish,Oryzias latipes (28Mikami T. Kusakabe T. Suzuki N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As a first step in investigating whether the expression of both genes is coordinated, we determined the genomic structure of OlGCS-α 1 andOlGCS-β 1 and report here thatOlGCS-α 1 and OlGCS-β 1are organized in tandem in the medaka fish genome. We analyzed promoter function of these genes by introducing promoter-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion constructs into embryos. The results suggest that the 5′-upstream region of OlGCS-α 1 controls expression of both OlGCS-α 1 andOlGCS-β 1 genes. Mature adults of the orange-red variety of medaka O. latipes were purchased from a dealer and kept in indoor tanks as described previously (29Seimiya M. Kusakabe T. Suzuki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23407-23417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Naturally spawned and fertilized eggs were collected and cultured in distilled water containing 0.00006% methylene blue at 27 °C. The developmental stage is expressed in days, and the day of fertilization is referred to as Day 0. Hatching usually occurred at Day 10. A genomic library of medaka fish (white strain) constructed in the Lambda Fix II vector was purchased from Stratagene and used for the isolation of genomic clones forOlGCS-α 1 andOlGCS-β 1. The cDNA fragments (nucleotide positions 1290 to 2346 for OlGCS-α 1 cDNA and nucleotide positions 241 to 1229 and 1833 to 2620 forOlGCS-β 1 cDNA) amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP using the digoxigenin-High Prime (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and used for screening as probes. Finally, four positive clones were obtained from approximately 1.35 × 106 recombinant phages. Phage DNA was purified by using the QIAGEN Lambda kit (QIAGEN), and the insert DNA was subcloned into pBluescript II KS(-) (Stratagene). The sequence of the insert DNA was determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination procedure (30Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar) with an Applied Biosystems 373A or PRISM 377 DNA sequencer and analyzed on DNASIS software (Hitachi Software Engineering Co.). Total RNA was extracted from Day 9 embryos according to the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63187) Google Scholar). The first strand synthesis and first PCR were performed using the 3′-Full RACE Core Set (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.). The specific primers forOlGCS-α 1 used for amplification were as follows: LF-1 for first PCR, 5′-GTGCAACTACTTGTATGTTTC-3′ (identical to nucleotides 2267–2287); LF-2 for second PCR, 5′-TTATTGATGTCTGACAGCCTA-3′ (identical to nucleotides 2304–2324); and LF-4 for second PCR, 5′-GTGTGGGTTGTGGATAAAACT-3′ (identical to nucleotides 2522–2542). Second PCR was performed using a 1/50 volume of the first PCR products as a template. The second PCR products were subcloned into pBluescript II KS(-) (Stratagene), and the sequence of the insert DNA was determined as described above. Total RNA was extracted from the adult medaka fish brain as described above. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using Oligotex-dT30 Super (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The oligonucleotides used for the primer extension experiments were as follows: PE-L1 forOlGCS-α 1, 5′-AAGACAGATGCGCTCGAG-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 97–114) and PE-S3 forOlGCS-β 1, 5′-ATGCTGAGATTGTCGGTGTT-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 2–21). The oligonucleotides were hybridized with 2 μg of the brain poly(A)+ RNA and extended by 200U SUPERSCRIPT II Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 45 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) containing 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm dNTP, 1.85 MBq of [α-32P]dCTP at 42 °C for 1 h. The sequence reaction was carried out by using Sequenase version 2.0 for the labeled dCTP kit (USB) and [α-32P]dCTP. Primer-extended products were treated with RNaseA and then separated on a 7m urea, 6% polyacrylamide gel with sequence reaction products. The radioactive signals were analyzed using a FUJIX Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Photo Film). Genomic DNA was isolated from the adult medaka brain as described (28Mikami T. Kusakabe T. Suzuki N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The genomic DNA (10 μg) was digested overnight with BamHI, EcoRV, andHindIII (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) and then separated on a 0.7% agarose gel. The DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 0.4 m NaOH as the transferring solution and hybridized with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe amplified by PCR (nucleotide positions 1290 to 1518 forOlGCS-α 1 cDNA) as described previously (28Mikami T. Kusakabe T. Suzuki N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To construct the fusion genes for the promoter analysis, the 5′-upstream regions ofOlGCS-α 1 (nucleotide positions −3913 to +45) and OlGCS-β 1 (nucleotide positions −1014 to +175) were amplified by PCR. The primer sets used for amplification were as follows: OlGCS-α 1, 5′-CTCAAGCTTCGAGCAAGGGTTTATGCAGAG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCCGTCAAATGATCAGCAAGAAGC-3′;OlGCS-β 1, 5′-CGCGGGCCCGAGTGCAATAAATGCTGTCAT-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCCGACAGATGCTGAGATTGTCG-3′. The PCR products were doubly digested with HindIII and BamHI forOlGCS-α 1, and ApaI andBamHI for OlGCS-β 1 and were subcloned into the corresponding sites of the pEGFP-1 Promoter Reporter vector (CLONTECH), and the resultant fusion gene constructs were named AG-1 and BG-1, respectively. The PCR product containing the 5′-upstream regions ofOlGCS-α 1 was subcloned into the pEBFP vector (CLONTECH), and the resultant fusion gene construct was named AB-1. A DNA fragment containing the 5′-upstream regions of OlGCS-α 1 and the blue fluorescent protein (BFP)-coding region was excised from AB-1 by digesting with HindIII and StuI and cloned into the corresponding site of BG-1. The resultant fusion gene construct was named ABBG-1. To construct a fusion gene that lacked a part of the 5′-upstream region ofOlGCS-β 1 containing the putative TATA box, PCR was performed with oligonucleotide primers 5′-CCGACAATCTCAGCATCTGT-3′ (identical to nucleotides +156 to +175 ofOlGCS-β 1) and 5′-GTTCACAGACCACAGTCGAT-3′ (complimentary to nucleotides −213 to −232 ofOlGCS-β 1). Both ends of the PCR products were blunted by T4 polymerase and then self-ligated. The resultant fusion gene construct was named ABBG-2. To prevent hardening of the chorion after fertilization, medaka fish fertilized eggs were incubated in 20 mmCAPS-NaOH (pH 10.5) containing 2 mm glutathione (Wako Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd.) at 4 °C for several hours (32Iwamatsu T. J. Exp. Zool. 1983; 228: 83-89Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Micropipettes were made by the horizontal puller (PN-3, Narishige) from a siliconized and sterilized 1 × 90-mm fiber-filled glass capillary tube (GD-1, Narishige). The DNA solution (10 ng/μl) was injected into the cytoplasm of both blastomeres of a medaka fish 2-cell stage embryo using a micropipette. The injected embryo was cultured as described above. GFP fluorescence was detected under a fluorescence microscope (IX70, Olympus). A medaka fish genomic library was screened with cDNA fragments ofOlGCS-α 1 or OlGCS-β 1. After repeated screening, four different clones (A2, A11, B5, B16) were obtained. Restriction enzyme mapping of these clones demonstrated that they overlap each other (Fig. 1). The nucleotide sequence of the insert DNA of each clone was determined and compared with that of the respective cDNA. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table I,OlGCS-α 1 consists of 9 exons andOlGCS-β 1 consists of 13 exons. The GT-AG rule was conserved for all splice sites except exon/intron 8 inOlGCS-α 1 (Table I). In the medaka fish genome, OlGCS-α 1 andOlGCS-β 1 are 986 bp apart and organized in tandem. The two genes span approximately 34 kilobase pairs in the order of OlGCS-α 1 andOlGCS-β 1.Table IExon-intron organization of the medaka fish soluble GC α1 and β1 subunit genesExon no.Exon sizeIntron size5′-Splice site sequence 3′-Splice site sequencebpbpOlGCS-α11433238GGG gtgagt . . . . . . . gtacag TTT268635AAG gtaact . . . . . . . tgacag CAC389142CAG gtactg . . . . . . . tgacag CAA4716900AAG gtatgt . . . . . . . tttcag CCC54863645AAG gtaagc . . . . . . . tcttag GTA61443391CAG gtaagg . . . . . . . cctcag ATG7155283CAG gtgaag . . . . . . . tcccag ATT8469497GGA taaaac . . . . . . . acaaag TAA9295OlGCS-β11252269ATG gtaagt . . . . . . . ttccag TAT2741834CAA gtaagt . . . . . . . ttgcag GAG310177TAA gtaagt . . . . . . . ttgcag AGA41192422CAG gtaagc . . . . . . . ttgcag AAT5198998AAG gtcagc . . . . . . . ctgcag GTA6231112CAG gtttgc . . . . . . . ccttag CTC71172653AAG gtagat . . . . . . . tgacag GAG8134742CAG gtaagc . . . . . . . ggttag TGT91981056TAG gtttga . . . . . . . ccccag ACT10238554AAG gtcaaa . . . . . . . aaacag GTG111412291CAG gtggga . . . . . . . ctgcag ATC12155231CAG gtaagt . . . . . . . tttcag GTG131182Exon sequences are in capital letters and intron sequences are in lowercase letters. Open table in a new tab Exon sequences are in capital letters and intron sequences are in lowercase letters. In a previous study, the nucleotide sequence of a part of the 3′-noncoding region of the cDNA forOlGCS-α 1, which should contain a polyadenylation signal sequence, has not been determined (28Mikami T. Kusakabe T. Suzuki N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To determine the nucleotide sequence of the 3′-end ofOlGCS-α 1, 3′-RACE was performed using total RNA from the Day 9 embryos. The 3′-RACE product with LF-2 primer contained the nucleotide sequence corresponding to that of intron 8 inOlGCS-α 1. The 3′-RACE with LF-4 primer, which was designed to cross the insert site of the intron 8, produced a 344-bp cDNA fragment. Each 3′-RACE product contained a putative polyadenylation signal sequence, AATAAA, 24–18 bp upstream of poly(A). To determine the transcription initiation sites of OlGCS-α 1 andOlGCS-β 1, primer extension experiments were performed using medaka fish brain poly(A)+ RNA (2 μg). Using a specific primer for OlGCS-α 1, one major and two minor bands were detected. The nucleotide corresponding to the major band, which is located most upstream of the three bands, was assigned to the transcription initiation site forOlGCS-α 1 (Fig.2). In the same way, the nucleotide corresponding to one detected band was assigned to the transcription initiation site for OlGCS-β 1. A putative TATA box, TATAGAA, is present 30–25 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site of OlGCS-β 1 (Fig.3). There is no TATA box in the corresponding region of OlGCS-α 1, although a TATA box consensus sequence, TATAATA, is present at 141–136 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site forOlGCS-α 1 (Fig. 2). A number of E-boxes are present in the 5′-upstream regions of each gene (Fig.4). Other known cis-regulatory elements, AP1, MEF-2, GATA, Sp1, CREB, and C/EBP binding sequences, are found in the 5′-upstream region of OlGCS-α 1. On the other hand, there is one GATA, AP1, and two C/EBP binding sequences in the 5′-upstream region ofOlGCS-β 1.Figure 3The nucleotide sequences of the 5′-upstream region of OlGCS-β 1. The first nucleotide of exon 1 was determined by the primer extension method and numbered as +1. An open box indicates the exon, and the initiation and stop codons are shaded. A putative TATA box is double-underlined, and the consensus sequences of knowncis-regulatory elements are underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Schematic drawing of fusion gene construction. Fusion genes containing the 5′-upstream regions ofOlGCS-α 1 or OlGCS-β 1with the pEGFP-1 vector were constructed and named AG-1 andBG-1, respectively. A putative TATA box and knowncis-regulatory elements found in the 5′-upstream region of the respective genes are indicated schematically in the open box. The conserved sequence regions between the 5′-upstream regions of OlGCS-α 1 andOlGCS-β 1 are indicated by arrows in the direction from 5′ to 3′. ABBG-1 and ABBG-2are BG-1 derivatives in which theOlGCS-α 1 upstream region connected with the BFP gene was inserted upstream of theOlGCS-α 1/OlGCS-β 1intervening sequence. ABBG-2 contains a 380-bp deletion (−226/+154 of OlGCS-β 1). The transcription initiation site of each gene is numbered as +1. The nucleotide number in the 5′-upstream regions of both genes is indicated every 1000 bp.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the 5′-upstream region ofOlGCS-α 1 with that of the intervening region between OlGCS-α 1 andOlGCS-β 1 demonstrated that the nucleotide sequences of about 330 bp (−1061 to −733 forOlGCS-α 1, −370 to −701 forOlGCS-β 1) are complimentarily conserved (Fig.5). The conserved sequences are divided into six highly conserved regions (I, −1046 to −977 forOlGCS-α 1; II, −971 to −953 forOlGCS-α 1; III, −942 to −888 forOlGCS-α 1; IV, −850 to −840 forOlGCS-α 1; V, −824 to −791 forOlGCS-α 1; VI, −753 to −742 forOlGCS-α 1). Some of these regions contain several consensus sequences of cis-regulatory elements, such as an E-box and C/EBP, which could be used for the transcription of both OlGCS-α 1 andOlGCS-β 1. In a previous study we performed a Southern hybridization analysis using medaka fish genomic DNA to examine whether OlGCS-α 1 andOlGCS-β 1 exist as a single copy (28Mikami T. Kusakabe T. Suzuki N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the results were not clear because the cDNA fragments used as probes crossed over many introns. Therefore, in this study we performed a genomic Southern analysis using a different probe containing a single exon (exon 5 of OlGCS-α 1). As shown in Fig.6, only one major band was detected in each of the three lanes. The size of the band in each lane is consistent with that of the DNA fragments obtained from the digestion of genomic clones by the respective restriction enzymes. These results suggest that OlGCS-α 1 is a single copy gene. To examine whether the 5′-upstream region of OlGCS-α 1 and the intervening region betweenOlGCS-α 1 and OlGCS-β 1have promoter activity, a fusion gene containing the 5′-upstream region of each gene and the GFP gene was constructed and named AG-1or BG-1, respectively (Fig. 4). The fusion gene was injected into the cytoplasm of both blastomeres of medaka fish 2-cell stage embryos. At 7 days after fertilization, the number of live embryos and embryos with GFP fluorescence was counted (TableII). GFP fluorescence was detected in the brain and somite of the Day 4 embryos injected with AG-1(Fig. 7 A). At 7 days after fertilization more than half (57.1%) of the injected embryos were alive, and GFP fluorescence in these embryos, which tended to increase as development proceeds, was detected in 14.8% of the live embryos (Fig. 7, E and F). In the embryos injected withBG-1, 74.3% of the embryos were alive at 7 days after fertilization. But no GFP fluorescence was detected in any injected embryos at this stage (Fig. 7 C), suggesting that the intervening region between OlGCS-α 1 andOlGCS-β 1 alone is not sufficient for detectable promoter activity.Table IIDetection of GFP fluorescence in medaka fish embryos injected with the fusion gene constructs containing the 5′-upstream regions of the α1 and/or β1 subunit genesConstructConcentration of DNANumber of injected embryosNumber of live embryosNumber of positive embryosμg/mlAG-11051029143BG-1102842110ABBG-11046519911ABBG-115254123ABBG-215111590The number of live and positive embryos was counted at 7 days after fertilization. Open table in a new tab The number of live and positive embryos was counted at 7 days after fertilization. Roles of the 5′-upstream region of OlGCS-α 1and the intervening region between the two subunit genes inOlGCS-β 1 expression were investigated by using a GFP-fusion construct (ABBG-1) in which theOlGCS-α 1 upstream region connected to a BFP-coding sequence were inserted upstream of the intervening region ofBG-1 (Fig. 4). GFP fluorescence was detected in the brain and trunk region of embryos injected with ABBG-1 (Table II). On the other hand, the reporter gene expression was not observed when a short upstream region (from −226 to +154) ofOlGCS-β 1 containing a putative TATA box and a transcription initiation site was removed from ABBG-1 (TableII, ABBG-2). These results suggest that the 5′-upstream region of OlGCS-α 1 can activate transcription of OlGCS-β 1 in conjunction with the intervening region between OlGCS-α 1 andOlGCS-β 1. Although ABBG-1 and ABBG-2 contain the BFP gene driven by the 5′-upstream region of OlGCS-α 1, BFP fluorescence was not observed in embryos injected with these constructs (data not shown). This might be because of much weaker fluorescence intensity of BFP than that of the enhanced variant of GFP used in this study. In this study we demonstrated that the 5′-upstream region ofOlGCS-α 1 is essential for the expression ofOlGCS-α 1. On the other hand, the intervening sequence between OlGCS-α 1 andOlGCS-β 1 seemed not to be sufficient forOlGCS-β 1 expression. Considering the tandem organization of OlGCS-α 1 andOlGCS-β 1, both genes might be cotranscribed as a single polycistronic mRNA as in the mouse and human upstream of the GDF gene (UOG-1) and the growth/differentiation factor-1 gene (GDF-1) (33Blumenthal T. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 480-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Alternatively, other regions such as the 5′-upstream region and/or intron of OlGCS-α 1would affect the transcription of OlGCS-β 1. Our results support the latter possibility. First, GFP fluorescence was observed in embryos injected with the ABBG-2 construct in which the 5′-upstream region of OlGCS-α 1 was located upstream of theOlGCS-α 1/OlGCS-β 1intervening sequence followed by the GFP gene. Second, there is a transcription initiation site for OlGCS-β 1 and a TATA box consensus sequence, TATAGAA, 30–25 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site for OlGCS-β 1. The reporter gene expression was abolished when the TATA box and the transcription initiation site were removed from ABBG-1. Therefore, basal transcription factors probably act on the intervening region between OlGCS-α 1 andOlGCS-β 1, and an enhancer in theOlGCS-α 1 upstream region can affect the promoter activity. The above could make it possible to temporally and spatially coordinate the transcription ofOlGCS-α 1 and OlGCS-β 1during the embryogenesis of the medaka fish. Sequence analysis revealed that a number of E-boxes, which are known to play a critical role in nerve and muscle differentiation (34Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1993; 75: 827-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), are present in the 5′-upstream region of each gene. This is consistent with our detection of GFP fluorescence in the brain of Day 4 embryos injected with the 5′-upstream region of theOlGCS-α 1-GFP construct. Scholz et al. (35Scholz N.L. Chang E.S. Graubard K. Truman J.W. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 34: 208-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that NO synthase and NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase are broadly distributed in the central nervous system of lobsters at hatching. The participation of the NO/cGMP signaling pathway in synaptogenesis has also been reported (22Truman J.W. De Vente J. Ball E.E. Development. 1996; 122: 3949-3958PubMed Google Scholar). Detection of GFP fluorescence in the brain of Day 4 embryos suggests a relation between soluble GC and neuronal development during the embryogenesis of the medaka fish. The ratio of embryos with GFP fluorescence to live embryos 7 days after fertilization was relatively low (14.8%). Although a higher concentration of DNA solution was able to increase the number of embryos with GFP fluorescence, it tended to cause morphological abnormalities and/or death (data not shown). It has previously been demonstrated that the mRNA level of each subunit gene is decreased by cAMP (24Shimouchi A. Janssens S.P. Bloch D.B. Zapol W.M. Bloch K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L456-L461PubMed Google Scholar, 25Papapetropoulos A. Marczin N. Mora G. Milici A. Murad F. Catravas J.D. Hypertension. 1995; 26: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this regard, it should be noted that a cAMP-response element is present in the 5′-upstream region of OlGCS-α 1. This element may participate in the regulation of transcription with a cAMP-response element modulator, which is known to inhibit transcription by binding to the cAMP-response element (36Foulkes N.S. Borrelli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1991; 64: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). There is one GATA and one MEF-2 binding sequence in the 5′-upstream region ofOlGCS-α 1, and it has been suggested that these sequences may participate in the differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (37Firulli A.B. Miano J.M. Bi W. Johnson A.D. Casscells W. Olson E.N. Schwarz J.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 38Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev.

Considering that soluble GC induces the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle in mammals (1Drewett J.G. Garbers D.L. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 135-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), these elements may regulate the expression of both genes in the medaka fish. In addition, others including Sp1, C/EBP, and AP1 in the 5′-upstream region ofOlGCS-α 1 and OlGCS-β 1may also be involved in the regulation of expression of both genes for soluble GC subunits in the medaka fish (40Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 18: 6573-6580Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of the 5′-upstream region ofOlGCS-α 1 are highly conserved in relation to that of the intervening region betweenOlGCS-α 1 and OlGCS-β 1in six different regions. Some of these regions havecis-regulatory elements in common with each other, suggesting that the highly conserved regions also participate in coordinated transcription. Adenylyl cyclase, which synthesizes another second messenger, cAMP, also has two catalytic domains punctuated by a membrane-spanning domain (41Tang W.-J. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 869-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The primary structure of each catalytic domain of adenylyl cyclase is conserved in those of the soluble and membrane forms of GCs (5Nakane M. Arai K. Saheki S. Kuno T. Buechler W. Murad F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16841-16845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that adenylyl cyclase as well as soluble GC require the two catalytic domains for cyclase activity (41Tang W.-J. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 869-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and that changes in a couple of the amino acids in the catalytic domain of adenylyl cyclase cause a functional change in adenylyl cyclase from cAMP production to cGMP production (42Tucker C.L. Hurley J.H. Miller T.R. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5993-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This suggests that soluble GC is evolutionarily related to adenylyl cyclase, although their forms are quite different. In this study, we determined the complete structure ofOlGCS-α 1 andOlGCS-β 1, demonstrating that the two genes are tandemly organized like a single gene. A comparison of the genomic structure between soluble GC and adenylyl cyclase may clarify the evolutionary relationship between both enzymes, although the genomic structure of the latter enzyme has not yet been reported. The soluble form of GC is present as a heterodimer, and the coexpression of both subunits is required for generating enzyme activity (13Harteneck C. Koesling D. Söling A. Schultz G. Böhme E.

It has been reported that two functionally related genes such as collagen IV α1 and α2 chain genes are coordinately expressed by a bidirectional promoter (43Burbelo P.D. Martin G.R. Yamada Y. Proc.

In this regard, our results presented here suggest the possibility of temporally and spatially coordinated transcription of both subunit genes for soluble GC during embryogenesis.

In order to identifycis-acting elements responsible for transcriptional regulation during the cell cycle, we investigated NIH/3T3 cells stably transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing various lengths of the human topo IIα gene promoter. Serum-deprived cells expressed low levels of luciferase, and following serum-induced cell cycle re-entry luciferase levels were gradually elevated 2-fold. During S phase, a steep 3-fold increase in luciferase activity was seen, reaching its maximum approximately 22 h after serum addition. This pattern was observed with both a full-length (nucleotides (nt) −295 to +90] and a deletion (nt −90 to +90) promoter construct. In contrast, when testing a deletion construct (nt −51 to +90) lacking the first inverted CCAAT box (ICB1) the S phase-specific induction was absent. Mutation of ICB1 revealed that it had a repressive character, since luciferase levels rose rapidly to maximal levels immediately following serum addition. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated a marked decrease in ICB1 binding activity following serum addition. Together, this suggests a role of ICB1 in cell cycle-dependent repression of topo IIα transcription.

Type II DNA topoisomerases are essential nuclear enzymes that regulate DNA topology by creating a transient double strand break through which a second intact double helix is passed (reviewed in Refs.1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar and 2Wang J.C. Q. Rev. Biophysics. 1998; 31: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). They are also the key cellular targets for a number of clinically important anticancer agents such as etoposide and the anthracyclines, doxorubicin and daunorubicin (3Chen A.Y. Liu L.F Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). There exist two isoforms of topoisomerase II (topo II) 1The abbreviations used are: topo II, topoisomerase II; ICB, inverted CCAAT box; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CDP, CCAAT displacement protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MBS, MYB binding site; bp, base pair(s). in higher eukaryotes, namely the α (170 kDa) and the β (180 kDa) isoform encoded by separate genes (4Tsai-Plugfelder M. Liu L.F. Liu A.A. Tewey K.M Whang-Peng J. Knutsen T. Heubner K. Croce C.N. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7177-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 5Jenkins J.R.

The α isoform is primarily required for chromosome (de)condensation and sister chromatid segregation during mitosis (6Adachi Y. Luke M. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1991; 64: 137-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 7Shamu C.E. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 921-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), but roles for topo IIα in replication and transcription have also been proposed (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). In contrast, a precise biological function of topo IIβ has not yet been established, although recent evidence has emerged for a role during differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 8Austin C.A. Marsh K.L. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). A major difference between the α and β isoform of topo II is their expression. The topo IIβ gene is constitutively expressed in proliferating as well as differentiated tissue (9Giaccone G. van Ark-Otte J. Scagliotti G. Capranico G. van der Valk P. Rubio G. Dalesio O. Lopez R. Zunino F. Walboomers J. Pinedo H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and its transcription rate is more or less constant throughout the cell cycle. In contrast, topo IIα activity is primarily associated with proliferating cells and progressively decreases as cells are induced to differentiate or deprived of serum (10Hsiang Y.-H. Wu H.-Y. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3230-3235PubMed Google Scholar). Levels of topo IIα enzyme also changes within a single cell cycle, with low levels during G0/G1 and accumulation during S and G2 to reach maximal levels during mitosis (11Heck M.M.S. Hittelmann W.N. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1086-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). This accumulation is obtained by enhancement of both transcriptional activity and mRNA stability during S phase (12Goswami P.C. Roti Roti J.L. Hunt C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hickson I.D. Davies S.L. Isaacs R.J. Redwood C. Sandri M.I. Wells N.J. Anticancer Drugs. 1996; 7 Suppl. 3: 19-25Google Scholar). This cell cycle-dependent pattern of expression is conserved among mammals, including mice and humans (14Adachi N. Kobayashi M. Koyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, no specificcis-acting DNA elements and/or trans-acting factors have been associated with this regulation. Topo II activity is an important determinant for the cytotoxic effect of the topo II-targeting drugs. Thus, a direct correlation between topo II levels and drug sensitivity of cells is a common finding. Indeed, reduction in the amount of topo II enzyme is one mechanism by which cancer cells acquire drug resistance (reviewed in Ref. 15Nitiss J.L. Beck W.T. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32A: 958-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). For this reason, considerable effort has been made to determine the mechanisms regulating topo II expression. These investigations have revealed that topo IIα transcription is highly susceptible to environmental stimuli such as heat shock, growth arrest, and drug treatment. For instance, when Swiss 3T3 cells are confluence-arrested topo IIα mRNA is rapidly down-regulated in response to reduced binding of the transcription factor NF-Y to an ICB (16Isaacs R.J. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16741-16747Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Another ICB has been associated with both transcriptional activation and repression of the topo IIα promoter in response to heat shock and p53 expression, respectively (17Furukawa M. Uchiumi T. Nomoto M. Takano H. Morimoto R.I. Naito S. Kuwano M. Kohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10550-10555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Wang Q. Zambetti G.P. Suttle D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During phorbol ester and sodium butyrate induced monocytic differentiation of promyeloid HL-60 cells the topo IIα promoter is trans-activated during the early stages, whereas it is down-regulated at later stages (19Fraser D.J. Brandt T.L. Kroll D.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 696-706PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the transcription factors c-MYB, B-MYB, NF-M, and Sp3 have been identified as trans-activators of the topo IIα gene promoter in various cellular backgrounds (20Brandt T.L. Fraser D.J.

We have investigated human topo IIα gene regulation during the cell cycle. Using NIH/3T3 cells stably transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing various promoter segments we show that induction of topo IIα promoter activity was sensitive to treatment with aphidicolin and roscovitine. Furthermore, S phase-specific induction can be partially reversed by treatment with the same drugs. In addition, we demonstrate that an ICB within the minimal promoter is required for G0/G1-specific repression of topo IIα transcription and that this ICB is differentially occupied during the cell cycle in a manner inversely related to promoter activity. Therefore, we propose that topo IIα transcription is cell cycle-regulated by a repressive mechanism. Human topo IIα gene promoter constructs (−562-TOP2LUC, −384TOP2LUC, −295TOP2LUC, −219TOP2LUC, −148TOP2LUC, −90TOP2LUC, and −51TOP2LUC; Ref. 20Brandt T.L. Fraser D.J. Leal S. Halandras P.M. Kroll A.R.

Point mutations in the −295TOP2LUC construct were introduced using the QiukChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutagenic primers used (together with complementary primers) were (5′ to 3′): GAGCTCTCCTAGCTGACGCGCGTC (mMBS), GGTCTGCTTCGTGCGTGCTAAAGG (mSP1), and GTCAGGGAAAAACTGGTCTGCTTC (mICB1) with the changed nucleotides in bold. Mutations were verified by sequencing of 1–2 μg of plasmid (not shown). All primers were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The mouse fibroblast cell line NIH/3T3 (gift from C. Caradelli) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.), in an incubator at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. NIH/3T3 cells were stably transfected by cotransfecting the −562TOP2LUC, −384TOP2LUC, −295TOP2LUC, −219TOP2LUC, −148TOP2LUC, −90TOP2-LUC, −51TOP2LUC, −295(mSP1)TOP2LUC, −295(mMYB)TOP2LUC, and −295(mICB1)TOP2LUC constructs together with the pTK-Hyg vector (CLONTECH) 10:1 (w/w) by the calcium phosphate method (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidmann J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, NY1994Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were selected for 4 weeks with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem). Subsequently, cells were maintained in DMEM containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. As we only investigated the relative changes of a given promoter construct, the entire population of resistant cells rather than individual clones was pooled, thus eliminating effects due to copy number and site of integration. Synchronization of stably transfected NIH/3T3 cells by serum starvation was performed by incubating cells for 72 h in DMEM containing 0.5% fetal calf serum. NIH/3T3 stable topoisomerase IIα promoter transfectants were seeded in six-well clusters (approximately 2 × 104 cells/well) and serum-starved to obtain synchronized populations. Cells were released into complete medium, and cell lysates were prepared every 2 h for a 22-h period. Thirty minutes prior to harvest, cells were incubated in prewarmed and CO2-equilibrated complete medium containing 5 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine (47.0 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subsequently, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and lysates were submitted to luciferase assay and quantitation of thymidine incorporation. Briefly, 150 μl of cold 20% trichloroacetic acid was added to an equal volume of cell lysate, vortexed, and incubated 15 min on ice. The lysates were then filtered through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters, washed, air-dried, and incorporated radioactive thymidine quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Luciferase assays were performed with 25 μl of cell lysate using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total light production was measured with a Turner Designs model TD-20/20 luminometer. Aphidicolin (Sigma) was used at 3 μmfor complete inhibition of DNA synthesis. Roscovitine (Calbiochem), an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases CDC2, CDK2, and CDK5 (36Krämer A. Carstens C.-P. Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5117-5121PubMed Google Scholar), was used at 25 μm for inhibition of CDK2-mediated S phase entry. For inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis, cells were treated with 0.1 μg/ml actinomycin D and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma), respectively. NIH/3T3 cells (∼4 × 107) were collected by exposure to trypsin, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 200 μl NE buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.75 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated 15 min on ice. Cells were then lysed by passage 10 times through a 25-gauge needle, and the lysate was centrifuged for 30 s in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 × g. The resulting nuclear pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of NESG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.75 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), incubated 30 min on ice with frequent mixing, and centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. The supernatant (nuclear extract) was stored at −80 °C, and its protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay according to the manufacturer's instruction. To detect sequence-specific protein-DNA interactions, EMSAs were performed. Briefly, 15 μg of nuclear extract protein was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 8% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC) DNA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 2 × 104 cpm of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe in the absence or presence of various competitors as indicated. The reaction mixtures were then applied to a nondenaturating 5% polyacrylamide gel and separated by electrophoresis at 100 V for 3 h in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, and 1 mm EDTA. Following electrophoresis, the gel was dried, exposed, and then recorded using a PhosphorImager. The following oligonucleotides (together with complementary ones) were used for EMSAs (5′ to 3′): GAGTCAGGGATTGGCTGGTCTGCTTCGGGC (ICB1) and GAGTCAGGGAAAAACTGGTCTGCTTCGGGC (mICB1). All oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. End labeling of oligonucleotides was done using the Ready-To-GoTM T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specific activity of the labeled oligonucleotides were determined by Cerenkov counting. The topo IIα transcription pattern is characterized by an increase during S phase of the cell cycle. To examine this pattern in detail, cell lines stably transfected with a range of different promoter constructs were prepared. The feasibility of this system required that a stably transfected full-length promoter construct would mimic the previously described expression pattern of topo IIα mRNA (12Goswami P.C. Roti Roti J.L. Hunt C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NIH/3T3 cells stably transfected with the −562TOP2LUC construct were synchronized by serum starvation, and luciferase activity and incorporation of radioactively labeled thymidine was measured every 2 h for a period of 22 h following serum addition. Low levels of luciferase activity and thymidine incorporation were observed in serum starved cells (Fig.1 A). Upon serum addition, when the cells treated with Me2SO re-entered the cell cycle, an immediate elevation of luciferase activity was detected reaching a plateau after approximately 4–6 h (Fig. 1 A). Subsequently, as cells entered S phase, seen as a steep increase in thymidine incorporation (12–14 h after serum addition), a concomitant increase in luciferase activity was seen that continued throughout the entire time course (Fig. 1 A). Together, this fitted the expected expression pattern of topo IIα mRNA and, as an identical pattern, was obtained in untreated cells (data not shown; Fig. 3 A); this approach was accordingly regarded as feasible.Figure 3Sequences between nt −90 and −51 are required for proper S phase-specific induction of the topo IIα promoter. NIH/3T3 cells stably transfected with −562TOP2LUC (A), −148TOP2LUC (B), −90TOP2LUC (C), or −51TOP2LUC (D) were synchronized by serum starvation. Following serum addition, cell extracts were prepared every 2 h for a 22-h period. Thirty min prior to harvest, radioactive thymidine was added to the medium, and luciferase activity (▪) and thymidine incorporation (▴) were measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” One of three representative experiments each done in triplicate is shown, and values represent averages ± S.E. (indicated by error bars).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It has been demonstrated that the accumulation of topo IIα mRNA during late S phase can occur independently of DNA synthesis and S phase entry (12Goswami P.C. Roti Roti J.L. Hunt C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, treatment of synchronized HeLa cells with the DNA polymerase α inhibitor aphidicolin only slightly delayed topo IIα mRNA accumulation. In order to investigate if the transcriptional induction of the topo IIα gene promoter also was insensitive to DNA synthesis inhibition, cells synchronized by serum starvation were treated with 3 μmaphidicolin or 25 μm roscovitine from 1 h after serum addition and throughout the 22-h time course. When treated only with solvent (Me2SO) a normal expression pattern was observed (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, treatment with aphidicolin or roscovitine abolished DNA synthesis and hence entry into S phase (Fig. 1, B and C). Accordingly, no S phase-specific induction of luciferase expression was seen (Fig. 1,B and C). However, an induction to almost wild type levels (Fig. 1 D, black bars) could be re-established in aphidicolin- and roscovitine-treated cells when the drug was removed 16 h after serum addition and the cells incubated for another 8 h in the absence of drug (Fig. 1 D,middle panel), indicating that the induction indeed was S phase-specific. Interestingly, an approximately 2.5-fold increase in luciferase activity occurred in aphidicolin-treated cells 4–6 h following serum addition (Fig. 1 B). In roscovitine-treated cells, an approximately 2-fold increase in luciferase was also observed, although with different kinetics (Fig. 1 C). This immediate elevation of luciferase expression was also found in Me2SO-treated cells (Fig. 1 A), implying either the presence of a specific serum-responsive cis-acting element in the promoter or a “global” effect of serum addition. In order to investigate if S phase entry per se was sufficient to mediate the observed S phase-specific induction of luciferase activity, or if ongoing DNA synthesis was required, cells were treated with aphidicolin and roscovitine 14 h after serum addition when DNA synthesis had started (see Fig.1 A). In addition, cells were treated with actinomycin D or cycloheximide to inhibit RNA or protein synthesis, respectively. As expected, treatment with solvent (Me2SO) had no effect on luciferase activity, whereas drug treatment more or less abolished the S phase-specific induction. In the case of actinomycin D, luciferase levels remained almost constant (Fig. 2), presumably due to contributions from already transcribed luciferase mRNAs and active luciferase protein. As seen, treatment with cycloheximide caused a steady decrease in luciferase activity (Fig. 2), reflecting the luciferase protein half-life of approximately 3 h (24Thompson J.F. Hayes L.S. Lloyd D.B. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 103: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Although greatly impairing the S phase-specific induction, treatment with roscovitine or aphidicolin did not completely abrogate transcription of luciferase mRNA, as reflected by the higher levels of luciferase activity compared with the actinomycind-treated cells (Fig. 2). The expression pattern mediated by the full-length promoter is, as mentioned, characterized by a steep increase in transcriptional activity coinciding with the onset of S phase (see Fig.1 A). This results in an approximately 7-fold induction relative to promoter activity in serum-starved cells, while the induction is only about 3-fold compared with the activity levels reached at the immediate plateau at 6–12 h (Figs. 1 A and3 A). All deletion constructs tested displayed similar thymidine incorporation patterns, although with some variations in incorporated counts (Fig. 3; data not shown). When deleting sequences between bp −562 and −90, no significant changes were observed in the ability of the constructs to mediate the S phase-specific induction of luciferase activity (Fig. 3,A–C), and induction levels ranged from 4- to 7-fold when comparing maximal observed luciferase activities with those in serum-starved cells (Table I). Interestingly, when comparing the induction from the immediate plateau levels to maximal levels, the increase only ranged between approximately 2.5- and 3-fold (Table I). Thus, although important for basal promoter activity per se, the sequences between bp −562 and −90 are dispensable with regard to mediating S phase-specific transcriptional induction in a heterologous context. In contrast, this induction was greatly impaired when deleting sequences between bp −90 and −51 (Fig. 3 D). Although capable of an approximately 3-fold total induction, the S phase-specific induction was almost absent (Fig. 3 D; Table I).Table IMaximal and S phase-specific induction of topo IIα promoter deletion and mutation constructsConstructLUmax/LUt = 0LUmax/LUt = 6−562TOP2LUC7.3 ± 2.1 (n = 6)3.2 ± 0.2 (n = 6)−384TOP2LUC5.2 ± 0.8 (n = 3)3.0 ± 0.4 (n = 3)−295TOP2LUC4.9 ± 0.7 (n = 8)2.9 ± 0.3 (n = 8)−219TOP2LUC4.1 ± 0.6 (n = 3)2.5 ± 0.3 (n = 3)−148TOP2LUC4.4 ± 0.5 (n = 3)2.7 ± 0.4 (n = 3)−90TOP2LUC4.9 ± 1.1 (n = 4)2.6 ± 0.5 (n = 4)−51TOP2LUC3.1 ± 0.2 (n = 5)1.1 ± 0.2 (n = 5)−295(mICB1)TOP2LUC3.0 ± 0.5 (n = 4)1.3 ± 0.3 (n = 4)−295(mMBS)TOP2LUC4.3 (n = 2)2.5 (n = 2)−295(mSp1)TOP2LUC3.4 ± 0.4 (n = 3)3.0 ± 0.5 (n = 3)Experiments similar to the one described in the legend to Fig. 3 were performed.

Values are averages of two to eight independent experiments (±S.E. when applicable). The sequences between bp −90 and −51 harbor only onecis-acting element, namely an ICB. Since the −51TOP2LUC construct had a low basal activity (not shown), this could also influence the expression. To demonstrate a possible role of this ICB (termed ICB1) in the S phase-specific induction of luciferase activity, the −295TOP2LUC construct was mutated in its ICB1. Additional mutations were also made in the MBS and the GC-box (both contained in the −51TOP2LUC construct), and the expression patterns of the three mutated constructs were examined together with the −295TOP2LUC construct. All three mutations lead to a small reduction in the maximal obtainable luciferase levels compared with the wild type promoter (Fig.4). The −295(mSp1)TOP2LUC changed expression pattern in a modest manner, as loss of the GC-box seemed to reduce the immediate increase observed in all other constructs, but not, as mentioned, the ability to mediate S phase-specific induction (Fig. 4 B; Table I). Nevertheless, the constructs carrying mutations in the MBS or the GC-box retained the ability of S phase induction. This was not the case for the −295(mICB1)TOP2LUC construct, as its expression differed markedly from the other three constructs (Fig. 4 D). Most notable was the sharp and rapid increase in luciferase activity immediately after serum addition, reaching a plateau after approximately 6 h (Fig. 4 D). From this plateau the levels did not increase significantly as the cells progressed into S phase (Fig. 4 D; Table I). Together this suggests an important repressive role of ICB1 in the S phase-specific induction of the topo IIα gene. Since the abovementioned data indicated that ICB1 might have a role in regulating S phase-specific induction of human topo IIα promoter activity, we decided to investigate if a cell cycle-dependent ICB1 binding activity was present in NIH/3T3 cells. In order to do so, nuclear extracts were prepared from synchronized cells at different time points following serum addition and tested for ICB1 binding activity in EMSAs. When examining exponentially growing NIH/3T3 cells with a oligonucleotide probe harboring ICB1, they contained a probe binding activity (Fig.5 A, lane 2). Serum-starved cells (t = 0 h; Fig. 5 A,lane 3) contained large amounts of probe binding activity compared with exponentially growing cells (Fig. 5 A,lane 2). As cells were stimulated to cell cycle re-entry by serum addition (t = 0 h), probe binding activity decreased as cells progressed through the cell cycle (Fig.5 A, lanes 4–9). Most notable are the very reduced levels of probe binding activity in nuclear extracts from cells 12–20 h post-stimulation (Fig. 5, lanes 6–8), when cells were in S phase (Fig. 1A). Twenty-four hours after serum addition, a slight increase in binding activity was observed (Fig. 5 A,lane 9), presumably coinciding with entry into mitosis. To demonstrate that the probe binding activity was dependent on ICB1, a series of EMSA experiments with various competitors were conducted. Nuclear extracts from exponentially growing cells were incubated with labeled ICB1 probe alone or in combination with 100-fold excess of unlabeled ICB1 or mICB1 probe. Coincubation with a probe containing a mutation in ICB1 (mICB1) did not reduce the amount of probe-protein complex (Fig. 5 B, lane 4), whereas the ICB1 probe was an efficient competitor when added in 100-fold excess (Fig.5 B, lane 3). Cell cycle-dependent regulation of human DNA topo IIα gene expression is controlled both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. To investigate the transcriptional changes in topo IIα expression during the cell cycle, a panel of NIH/3T3 cell lines stably transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing various lengths of the human topo IIα promoter was constructed. The entire population of resistant cells, rather than individual clones, was pooled in order to eliminate unwanted effects due to copy number and site of integration. Initial experiments indicated that this was a feasible approach, as the luciferase activity pattern in synchronized cells mimicked previously observed topo IIα expression patterns (12Goswami P.C. Roti Roti J.L. Hunt C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Adachi N. Kobayashi M. Koyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the 2–3-fold S phase-specific induction levels observed were comparable with previously reported levels (12Goswami P.C. Roti Roti J.L. Hunt C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hickson I.D. Davies S.L. Isaacs R.J. Redwood C. Sandri M.I. Wells N.J. Anticancer Drugs. 1996; 7 Suppl. 3: 19-25Google Scholar, 14Adachi N. Kobayashi M. Koyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transcriptional activation could be blocked in a reversible manner by treatment with the DNA synthesis inhibitor aphidicolin or the CDK inhibitor roscovitine. In contrast, aphidicolin does not interfere with the timing of changes in topo IIα mRNA stability in HeLa cells (12Goswami P.C. Roti Roti J.L. Hunt C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar discrepancy is also observed when cells are heat shocked: topo IIα mRNA stability decreases upon heat shock, whereas the topo IIα promoter is activated (12Goswami P.C. Roti Roti J.L. Hunt C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Furukawa M. Uchiumi T. Nomoto M. Takano H. Morimoto R.I. Naito S. Kuwano M. Kohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10550-10555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Supposedly, these differences reflect different regulatory mechanisms responsible for controlling topo IIα gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, respectively. Experiments with synchronized NIH/3T3 stable transfectants indicated that an ICB situated between bp −90 and −51 in the topo IIα promoter (ICB1) played an important role in the S phase-specific induction of the promoter. Specifically, loss of ICB1 function resulted in abrogation of the S phase-specific induction by prematurely inducing the promoter during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In addition, EMSA experiments demonstrated a cell cycle-dependent ICB1 binding activity in NIH/3T3 nuclear extracts. Binding to ICB1 was most pronounced in serum-starved cells, and as cells entered S phase, ICB1 binding was markedly decreased. Together, these data suggest a role for ICB1 in transcriptional repression of the topo IIα gene. The presence of an ICB1 binding activity has been described in several studies (17Furukawa M. Uchiumi T. Nomoto M. Takano H. Morimoto R.I. Naito S. Kuwano M. Kohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10550-10555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Herzog C.E. Zwelling L.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); however, none of these have addressed its occupation as a function of growth state. Nevertheless, ICB1 has been proposed to mediate repression of topo IIα transcription. In vivofootprint analysis of the human topo IIα promoter revealed that promoter activation by heat shock was accompanied by reduced protein binding to ICB1 (17Furukawa M. Uchiumi T. Nomoto M. Takano H. Morimoto R.I. Naito S. Kuwano M. Kohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10550-10555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ICB1 has previously been associated with p53-mediated repression of the topo IIα promoter (18Wang Q. Zambetti G.P. Suttle D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CDK inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip1 is transcriptionally activated by p53 in response to DNA damage, which among other things leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 26Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that transcriptional activation of the topo IIα gene can be suppressed by inhibition of ongoing DNA synthesis and CDK activity. Thus, p53-mediated repression of the topo IIα promoter may be an indirect effect of DNA synthesis and CDK inhibition as a consequence of p21Waf1/Cip1 activation. This is supported by the fact that the topo IIα promoter does not contain a bona fide p53 binding site. ICBs are predominantly bound by the transcriptional activator NF-Y (27Bi W. Wu L. Coustry F. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26562-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 28Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). However, evidence has accumulated for a more complex role for ICBs, other than mediation of transcriptional activation (reviewed in Ref. 29Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). For instance, occupation of ICBs by the transcriptional repressor CDP/cut has been reported in several cases (30Kim E.C. Lau J.S. Rawlings S. Lee A.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1329-1338PubMed Google Scholar, 31Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the binding specificity of CDP/cut for individual ICBs is determined by their surrounding sequences, and especially GC-boxes seem to enhance the ICB-specific binding by CDP/cut (33Mailly F. Bérubé G. Harada R. Mao P.-L. Phillips S. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5346-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). There is some support for a role of CDP/cut in the transcriptional regulation of the topo IIα promoter. First, ICB1 can mediate repression and is situated next to a GC-box (37Hochhauser D. Stanway C.A. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, CDK2 and/or CDC2 activity seems to be important for transcriptional activation of the topo IIα promoter, and both CDK2 and CDC2 have been shown to be present in a high molecular weight protein complex containing CDP/cut(32van Wijnen A.J. van Gurp M.F. de Ridder M.C. Tufarelli C. Last T.J. Birnbaum M. Vaughan P.S. Giordano A. Krek W. Neufeld E.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Stein J.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 512-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Alternatively, recent reports indicate that NF-Y activity also can be modified via interactions with other factors (35Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P.J. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J.-G. Moulinoux J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, 36Krämer A. Carstens C.-P. Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5117-5121PubMed Google Scholar). If this is the case in terms of topo IIα promoter regulation, such interactions would have to affect the DNA binding activity of NF-Y, since protein levels of the A subunit of NF-Y are unaffected by the growth state of NIH/3T3 cells (data not shown). Although such an alteration of NF-Y DNA binding activity has been proposed to mediate the down-regulation of the topo IIα promoter in confluence-arrested cells (16Isaacs R.J. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16741-16747Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), this is probably not the case in the cell cycle-dependent repression of the topo IIα promoter reported here, as an antibody against NF-Y did not produce a supershift of the ICB1-probe-protein complex (data not shown). In summary, we have shown that the transcriptional induction of the topo IIα gene requires S phase entry, ongoing DNA synthesis, and CDK2 and/or CDC2 activity. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that ICB1 plays an important repressive role in the transcriptional regulation of topo IIα. The challenge now is to identify an ICB1-binding protein complex and deliniate the biochemical changes responsible for its differential occupation of ICB1. We are indebted to Dr. David Kroll for his generous gift of gene promoter constructs and to Dr. C Caradelli for supplying NIH/3T3 cells. The technical assistance of Sanne Christiansen is highly appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W1994015734,"Calcineurin is a Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase that plays critical functional roles in T-cell activation and other Ca2+-mediated signal transduction pathways in mammalian cells. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, calcineurin regulates the transcription of several genes involved in maintaining ion homeostasis (PMC1, PMR1, and PMR2) and cell wall synthesis (FKS2). In this paper, we report the identification and characterization of 11 single amino acid substitutions in the yeast calcineurin catalytic subunit Cna1p. We show that six substitutions (R177G, F211S, S232F, D258V, L259P, and A262P) affect the stability of calcineurin and that two substitutions (V385D and M400R) disrupt the interaction between Cna1p and the calcineurin regulatory subunit Cnb1p. We also identify three mutations (S373P, H375L, and L379S) that are clustered between the catalytic and the calcineurin B subunit-binding domains. These mutations do not significantly affect the ability of Cna1p to interact with Cnb1p, calmodulin, or Fkb1p (FK506-binding protein). However, these residue substitutions dramatically affect calcineurin activity both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, by using a random mutagenesis approach, we have shown for the first time that the linker region of the calcineurin catalytic subunit, as defined by the Ser373, His375, and Leu379 residues, is crucial for its function as a phosphatase."

In addition to cornea, by use of an antibody to KSPG25, the protein was detected in a number of other bovine tissues. Comparison of the cDNA sequences showed that the entire sequence for osteoglycin occurs in KSPG25. As a result of these findings, the name mimecan was given to the gene and its full-length translation product (a 34-kDa glycoprotein) in recognition of its elusive nature, its presence in many tissues as a non-sulfated glycoprotein, and its tissue-specific glycosylation and thus conversion to KSPG in cornea (9Funderburgh J.L.

The diversity of mimecan mRNA isoforms was found in the non-coding regions. The primary structure of the encoded protein remained unchanged, indicating its functional importance. Indeed, mimecan appears to be conserved among species (2Madisen L. Neubauer M. Plowman G. Rosen D. Segarini P. Dasch J. Thompson A. Ziman J. Bentz H. Purchio A.F.

Thus,in situ proteolytic cleavage of the full-length protein was proposed to account for the multiple size protein products detectable in different tissues: a 12-kDa osteoglycin in bone and a 25-kDa KSPG25 in cornea (9Funderburgh J.L.

At present, the physiological function of mimecan is unknown. However, the protein shares a common core structure with a family of related proteins known as SLRPs. These are characterized by repeats of leucine-rich motifs bounded by two cysteine clusters and a conserved pattern of glycosylation. Numerous examples illustrate the ability of these proteins to bind growth factors and/or growth factor receptors and therefore to modulate cell proliferation and differentiation (reviewed in Refs. 13Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar and 14Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). These characteristics suggest that mimecan may play its specific role in modulation of cellular growth and matrix assembly, similarly to other closely related PGs, such as decorin (15Danielson K.G.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). As yet, there is no information on the structure of the mimecan gene. In this study, we describe the isolation of genomic clones spanning the bovine mimecan gene. We report here the structure of the gene and describe a new exon in the 5′-untranslated region. We show that mimecan transcripts from bovine cornea are heterogeneous in their 5′-regions. Two RNA transcripts are generated by alternative transcription initiation sites and an additional two result from alternative use of two distinct splice acceptor sites in the third exon. This, together with our previous demonstration of two alternative polyadenylation sites, indicates that at least eight different mRNA transcripts are generated that code for the same protein, with most of the combinations identified so far in bovine cornea. We also present evidence that the alternative use of two splice acceptor sites in a single exon and generation of two mimecan transcripts occur from the human mimecan gene as well. The diversity of mimecan transcripts detected in the same tissue suggest its importance. To explore its structural basis, we undertook studies to determine the expression pattern of differentially spliced mimecan transcripts by cultured keratocytes. We demonstrate that their expression can be differentially regulated by b-FGF. Such growth factors, therefore, may participate in the tissue-specific regulation of the mimecan gene in vivo and in the cornea in particular. Five uncloned bovine genomic “libraries” were constructed using the Universal Genome Walker Kit (CLONTECH) and used as templates for PCR amplifications. Briefly, the method involves the digestion of genomic DNA with different restriction enzymes that leave blunt ends and subsequent ligation of each pool of DNA fragments to the GenomeWalker adaptor to create uncloned libraries. Nested Adaptor Primers that anneal to the adaptor at one end and nested GSPs that anneal to the mimecan sequence at the other end were then used for the primary and secondary PCR reactions. In addition to these libraries, undigested bovine and human genomic DNAs (CLONTECH) were also used as templates for amplification of intron fragments. Genomic DNA (500 ng) was amplified in 50-μl reactions that contained 500 μm dNTPs, 1.75 mm MgCl2, 300 nm amounts of each primer pair, and 1 μl of enzyme mix containing thermostableTaq and proofreading Pwo DNA polymerases (Expand Long Template PCR System; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Amplifications were carried out for 25 cycles, with denaturation at 92 °C for 10 s, annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 18 min. The resulting PCR products were resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR products from several independent PCR amplifications were subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) for identification by sequence analysis. A bovine genomic DNA library in λ DASH II (Stratagene) was used for screening. Approximately 106 plaques were screened by standard plaque hybridization (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled mimecan cDNA probe (9Funderburgh J.L. Corpuz L.M.

Three genomic clones remained positive on tertiary screening. These were analyzed by Southern blots (22Southern E.M. J. Mol.

Two clones were positive with the middle and the 3′-end probes, and one was positive with the 5′-end and intron probes isolated in the initial experiments. The positive clones were further characterized by restriction enzyme mapping, and the overlapping restriction fragments were subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) and sequenced. Plasmid DNA was purified using Qiagen kits. Nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using M13 Forward and Reverse primers. Sequences were determined on both strands of overlapping clones. Alignment of nucleotide sequences for determination of the intron/exon boundaries was performed using the program contained in GeneWorks 2.5.1 (IntelliGenetics Corp.). Comparisons with EMBL and NCBI data bases were performed using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (24Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

Two human eyes (from 57- and 92-year-old donors) were obtained from the Missouri Lions Eye Research Foundation, Columbia, MO. The corneas were excised and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 serum-free culture medium containing 0.2% trypsin (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight and then at 37 °C for 30 min. Both sides of the cornea were then scraped to remove the endothelium and epithelium, and the stroma was cut into small pieces. The pieces were incubated with 10 mg/ml bacterial collagenase (type L, Sigma) at 37 °C for 2–3 h, and the cells were recovered by centrifugation. Bovine corneas were treated similarly, and total RNA from bovine and human keratocytes was isolated by the guanidinium/phenol/chloroform method, as described (10Tasheva E.S. Corpuz L.M.

Gene (Amst.). 1998; 218: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Total RNA from other human tissues was obtained fromCLONTECH and Ambion. RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using 10 μmol of the bovine GSP12 or human GSP3, with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.5 mm dNTPs for 50 min at 42°C in buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Reactions were terminated by addition of 1 μl of RNase H, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 20 min and heat inactivation (95 °C, 5 min). The cDNA fragments were then amplified by PCR with bovine GSP1 and GSP9, or human GSP1 and GSP2. The sequence and positions of all GSPs used in this study are shown in Table I. All 50-μl PCR amplification reactions contained 10 mm Tris, pH 9, 50 mmKCl, 0.1% Triton 100, 1.5 mm MgCl2,Taq polymerase (5 units), 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 100 ng of each primer pair and were carried out for 30 cycles (95 °C, 1 min; 55 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 2 min). Resulting PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels with DNA visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The PCR products were eluted from the gel, subcloned into pGEM-T vectors (Promega Corp.) and sequenced.Table IPCR primers used in this studyPrimer sequencePositionPrimers for bovine mimecan geneSenseGSP15′-CTAATGCAAGCCATGACCATCTATTGAGGAAACC-3′7210–7245GSP25′-AACTCACATGAGACAGGATCATGGG-3′7959–7984GSP35′-CAGGTATTCTAAGGAGACTTCAATTGCG-3′8008–8036GSP45′-GTTCGCTGGCCCCTGCTGCGTATACCCTG-3′8202–8231AntisenseGSP55′-GGTACCTTGAACAAAGGTACGCAATTGAAGTCTTCTTAG-3′8054–8017GSP65′-CTAATAAGCTAGTGGCCTGCTGACTGTGG-3′8336–8307GSP75′-GTAGATTGCAGAGTCTTCATTTTAATAG-3′8383–8355GSP85′-TGCTGAGATGGTGGTGCTGGCTTTATCAGAGG-3′8437–8405GSP95′-CCATCCAGGTATTTATCCTCATAATCTTGG-3′8524–8494GSP105′-CAAAAACATGCATTTAAATGGGTG-3′8600–8576GSP115′-CATCATTTTCTTTCTTGGGGG-3′10044–10023GSP125′-GCAGGCATGTGGGCATTTCATCATTTTCTTTCTTGGGGGG-3′15360–15342/10044–10022Primers for human mimecan gene:SenseHGSP15′-TCTCATTCACCCTCCCACTTGG-3′11–33aFrom GenBank EST data base accession no.

Anchor oligonucleotide provided in the kit was ligated to the 3′-end of the cDNA, and the ligation product was used as template for PCR reactions with a nested GSP5 and a primer complementary to the anchor sequence. The amplified products were cloned into pGEM-T and sequenced. The transcriptional start site of the bovine mimecan gene also was analyzed by primer extension. GSP8 and GSP12 were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). Twenty-five μg of RNA was mixed with 5 × 104 counts of labeled oligonucleotide, dried, and redissolved in 30 μl of hybridization solution containing 80% deionized formamide (26Tasheva E.S. Funderburgh J.F. Corpuz L.M. Conrad G.W. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 218: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Hybridization was carried out at 30 °C overnight. Primer extension was performed with 40 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) for 90 min at 42 °C. The extended products were analyzed on 8% sequencing gels. Ten μg of genomic DNA was digested with an appropriate restriction endonuclease, fractionated in a 0.8% agarose gel and transferred onto nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus, NEN Life Science Products) as described previously (29Tasheva E.S.

Hybridization was carried out overnight at 65 °C. Following hybridization, the filter membranes were washed and exposed to X-Omat AR film (Kodak Scientific Imaging System) at −70 °C for 1–3 days. Bovine corneal keratocytes were isolated from the central portions of fresh corneas as described previously (30Tasheva E.S. Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Corpuz L.M. Conrad G.W.

Cells were incubated at 2 × 104cells/cm2 in 75 cm2 T flasks (Costar) into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium with antibiotics (100 μg/ml each penicillin and streptomycin, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B). Incubation continued in the above medium containing 0.1% platelet-poor horse serum (Sigma catalog no.

Incubation was continued for up to 6 days. At the indicated time periods, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and total RNA was isolated. RPAs were performed on 1 μg of RNA using the following plasmid clones for the synthesis of antisense RNA probes: the 662-bp HindIII restriction fragment from bovine mimecan cDNA (positions 298–960) cloned into pGEM-1 vector; the BglII-NruI DNA fragment from bovine lumican (positions 548–1099) cloned into theBamHI-SmaI sites of pGEM-1; and a 350-bp DNA fragment obtained by PCR with primers complementary to bovine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (GenBank accession no.

Radioactive bands were evaluated by autoradiography and laser densitometry using an ImageQuant PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The relative quantities of RNA were calculated as the ratio of the intensity of the protected band derived from the corresponding message to that of the protected band derived from the message for the internal standard (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), after correcting for the variations in the length of all protected bands. These ratios were then plotted using the program contained in DeltaGraph®Professional. The initial strategy used to determine the structure of the bovine mimecan gene was the cloning of genomic fragments obtained from genomic DNA by PCR. Having previously demonstrated a 278-bp differentially spliced region of mimecan cDNA, between nucleotides 62 and 340 (10Tasheva E.S. Corpuz L.M. Funderburgh J.L. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32551-32556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we chose to look for introns on both sides of this region. Using primer pair GSP1 and GSP5, designed to amplify the upstream intron, a PCR product of 765 bp was obtained from genomic DNA. The fragment was 658 bp larger than the distance between the two primers on cDNA, indicating that indeed the upstream intron was amplified. The results of these experiment are shown in Fig. 1. Similar results were obtained with additional primer pairs (GSP1-GSP6 and GSP1-GSP7). Sequence analysis of these PCR products and alignment to bovine mimecan cDNA located the upstream intron exactly as predicted, between nucleotides 62 and 63. Similarly, other primer pairs (GSP2 and GSP11, GSP3 and GSP11, GSP4 and GSP11) designed to amplify the downstream intron gave PCR products whose sizes were larger than the distance between primers on cDNA indicating that the downstream intron was amplified. Much to our surprise, sequence analysis of these PCR products and alignment to mimecan cDNA showed that the downstream intron of 1.41 kb is located between nucleotides 527 and 528 of mimecan cDNA, whereas the expected position was between nucleotides 340 and 341. Additional PCR with primers GSP4 and GSP9 gave a product of 322 bp, a size corresponding to the distance between primers on cDNA and therefore confirming the lack of an intron between nucleotides 340 and 341. At least three possibilities could explain these results. First, steric DNA structures that make it difficult to obtain certain regions directly from genomic DNA; second, mimecan-related sequences, such as pseudogenes, may have been amplified; and third, a splice site within the 527-bp exon may exist. To test for the first possibility, as template for PCR amplifications, we used genomic DNA that was digested with restriction enzymes, i.e. the DNA from our uncloned libraries. To exclude the second possibility, we designed primers from the intron regions flanking the 527-bp exon. The sizes of PCR products obtained with either approach were consistent and demonstrated the lack of an intron between nucleotides 340 and 341. The third possibility required that a signal for splicing be located within the 527-bp exon. Inspection of nucleotide sequence of this region and comparison with the canonical sequence elements required for normal splicing revealed that, indeed, the AG dinucleotide at the 3′-intron terminus and the conserved branch site sequences can be found at both positions in bovine and human (see below) mimecan genes: at the intron/exon junction, as well as within the 527-bp exon, exactly 278 bp downstream of its 5′-end (Fig. 2). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the alternate mRNA message was generated by an alternate usage of these two splice acceptor sites.Figure 2Nucleotide sequences at the junction between the upstream intron and the 527-bp exon and nucleotide sequence at the alternative splice site within the 527-bp exon in bovine and human mimecan genes.

Thus, in the homeotic gene Ultrabithorax involved in specifying the identities of segments in the fly, Drosophila melanogaster, two separate splice donor sites at the end of the common 5′ exon are situated 27 bp apart (32Busturia A. Vernos I. Macias A. Casanova J. Morata G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3551-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In most cases described so far, these multiple transcripts encode different protein isoforms that are expressed in a tissue-specific or developmental manner (32Busturia A. Vernos I. Macias A. Casanova J. Morata G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3551-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 33Lopez A.J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 396-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In contrast, the RNA isoforms generated from bovine mimecan gene encode a protein whose primary structure remains unchanged. A similar case is described in the human α2(VI) collagen gene, in which a leader exon contains three distinct splice donor sites (34Saitta B. Timpl R. Chu M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6188-6196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These are alternatively used to generate multiple transcripts, but the translated domains remain unchanged, as in the bovine mimecan gene. Untranslated regions are likely to be involved in the regulation of protein expression. For example, the usage of alternative 5′-untranslated regions has been shown to discriminate the translation of mRNA coding for human insulin-like growth factor II (35Nielsen F.C. Gammeltoft S. Christiansen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13431-13434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the biological significance of multiple mimecan transcripts remains to be determined. We next attempted to determine whether this alternative splice site is similarly used in the human mimecan gene. Comparison of the bovine mimecan cD"

It also encodes three enzymes required for its replication: a heterodimeric DNA polymerase, a heterotrimeric helicase-primase or primosome, a single strand DNA-binding protein (ICP8), and an origin-binding protein (UL9 protein) (1Challberg M.

A comparison of the amino acid sequence of the HSV-1 UL9 protein with that from several other herpesviruses shows the helicase and DNA binding domains to be highly conserved (9Martinez R. Shao L.

To unwind the high affinity Box I element of the Oris, we have found that the UL9 protein must interact with ICP8 bound to a 3′ single strand positioned downstream of the Box I sequence (Box I substrate, Fig. 1) (14Lee S.S.-K. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This orientation of the UL9 protein bound to the Box I permits the specific interaction of the C-terminal 27 amino acids of the UL9 protein with ICP8, thereby determining the 3′ → 5′ directionality of Box I unwinding. The UL9 protein exists in solution as a homodimer (5Bruckner R.C. Crute J.J. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2669-2674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Fierer D.S. Challberg M.S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3986-3995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, studies of its helicase and ATPase activities have shown the active form of the UL9 protein to be a dimer (6Fierer D.S. Challberg M.S. J.

However, there have been conflicting findings regarding the interaction of the UL9 protein with Box I. In one study (15Martin D.W. Munoz R.M. Oliver D. Subler M.A. Deb S. Virology. 1994; 198: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), only one of the two monomers of UL9 protein was found to bind to Box I. In two other studies (16Stabell E.C. Olivo P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5203-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Fierer D.S. Challberg M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7330-7334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), both monomers of the UL9 protein were found to contact Box I. All of these studies were performed with a truncated 37-kDa form of the UL9 protein (t-UL9), which contains only the DNA binding domain and exists as a monomer in solution (18Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Stow N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17424-17429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support the suggestion that only one monomer of the UL9 protein contacts Box I sequence. (i) The affinity of the UL9 homodimer and the t-UL9 monomer for Box I is identical, suggesting that only one monomer is required for binding (19Elias P. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 24621-24626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) The DNase I protection pattern produced upon binding of the UL9 homodimer to the Box I sequence is indistinguishable from that found with the t-UL9 monomer (18Elias P. Gustafsson C.M.

Chem. 1991; 266: 24621-24626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (iii) A complex of Box I, the t-UL9 monomer, and ICP8 has been isolated whose molecular weight suggests that only one t-UL9 protein monomer binds to Box I (21Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19028-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). (iv) A 1:1 complex of the UL9 homodimer and ICP8 is required to unwind Box I and unwinding is unidirectional (14Lee S.S.-K. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the experiments reported here we have found that only one of the two monomers of the UL9 homodimer contacts Box I and unwinds the Box I substrate when ICP8 is bound to the downstream 3′ single strand. We have also observed that the interaction between UL9 protein and ICP8 influences the UL9 protein-Box I interaction before unwinding. Finally, we have observed that the UL9 protein monomer very likely undergoes a conformational change upon binding of Box I. Recombinant UL9 protein and ICP8 were purified from baculovirus-infected Sf21 insect cells as described previously (14Lee S.S.-K. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Rabbit antiserum directed against the C-terminal 10 amino acids of the UL9 protein was a generous gift from Dr. Mark Challberg (NIH). Rabbit antibodies directed against the C-terminal 10 amino acids (anti-UL9 CT10) as well as full-length recombinant UL9 protein were purified with the use of a protein A column. For the photocross-linking assays, two forms of Box I were prepared as described previously (14Lee S.S.-K. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A fully duplex Box I (24 bp) containing bromodeoxyuridine (B) in place of thymine was prepared by annealing 5′ 32P-labeled 5′-CGCGAAGCGBBCGCACBBCGTCCC-3′ with 5′-GGGACGAAGTGCGAACGCTTCGCG-3′ (Fig. 1). Box I containing single strand DNA tails (Box I substrate, Fig. 1) was prepared by annealing the 5′ 32P-labeled top strand (44 nucleotides) with the bottom strand (36 nucleotides) (14Lee S.S.-K. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Both substrates were gel purified. Reaction mixtures (25 μl) containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 7 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg bovine serum albumin, 2 pmol of fully duplex BrdUrd-substituted Box I, and the indicated amounts of UL9 protein were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The samples were then transferred to an ice water bath and exposed under a hand-held UV probe (Fotodyne) at 300 nm for 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min, respectively. The reactions were stopped by adding SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and heated at 90 °C for 10 min. The UL9 protein-Box I complexes were separated by 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weights of the complexes were estimated by comparison with several pre-stained molecular marker proteins. Quantitation of cross-linked UL9 protein-Box I complexes was performed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To examine the effect of ICP8 on the UL9 protein-Box I substrate interaction, the indicated amounts of ICP8 were mixed with UL9 protein (2 pmol) and Box I substrate. Photocross-linking was performed under the same conditions as described above, except that the wavelength was 260 nm. The samples were analyzed by 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the amount of cross-linked UL9 protein-ICP8-Box I substrate complexes was quantitated with a PhosphorImager. Each of the cross-linking experiments was performed a minimum of four times. Reaction mixtures (25 μl) containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 7 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 pmol of Box I substrate, 2 pmol of UL9 protein, and the indicated amounts of ICP8 were assembled on ice (14Lee S.S.-K. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The reactions were initiated by adding ATP (4 mm) and continued for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by adding 6.5 μl of stop solution (100 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 10 μg of proteinase K). The single-stranded DNA products were separated from the Box I substrate by nondenaturing 16% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 10 V/cm, and quantitated with a PhosphorImager. To examine the influence of anti-UL9 protein antibodies on unwinding of the Box I substrate, the indicated amounts of antibody were pre-incubated with UL9 protein (2 pmol) alone or UL9 protein (2 pmol) and the Box I substrate (2 pmol) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were initiated by adding 4 pmol of ICP8 and 4 mm ATP, and incubated for an additional 30 min. The reaction mixtures were analyzed as described above. Each of the unwinding assays was performed a minimum of four times. UL9 protein (120 pmol) was incubated with the radiolabeled BrdUrd-containing fully duplex Box I (60 pmol) at 37 °C for 15 min, followed by photocross-linking at 300 nm for 20 min. The mixture (100 μl) was loaded onto a Sephacryl 200 gel filtration column (1.5 × 60-cm) equilibrated with a buffer consisting of 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 mm NaCl. The column was monitored with Box I substrate and with molecular weight marker proteins, β-amylase (200 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), before and after the sample was loaded. The radioactivity of 50 μl-aliquots of the fractions was determined by scintillation counting. The UL9 protein exists as a stable homodimer in solution. In view of the uncertainty regarding the mode of interaction between Box I and the UL9 protein, we first wished to determine whether the UL9 protein contacts Box I as a monomer or dimer. The experimental protocol is illustrated in Fig. 1. UL9 protein was photocross-linked to fully duplex Box I DNA containing BrdUrd in place of thymine, and the products were analyzed by 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The reaction conditions including the concentration of UL9 protein and Box I were similar to those used for the Box I unwinding assay. If both UL9 monomers (apparent molecular mass, 83 kDa) contact Box I (molecular mass of single-stranded 44-mer, 13.3 kDa) an approximately 180-kDa complex should be formed. If only one monomer of the UL9 homodimer interacts with Box I DNA, the molecular mass of the complex should be approximately 93 kDa (Fig.1). As shown in Fig. 2, when equivalent amounts of UL9 protein and Box I were irradiated at 300 nm, a 93-kDa complex of UL9 protein cross-linked to Box I was formed. The presence of the UL9 protein in the complex was verified by immunoprecipitation with antibody directed against the UL9 protein (data not shown). Formation of this complex was UL9 protein-specific and dependent upon UV-irradiation. The molecular mass of the complex indicated that only one monomer of UL9 homodimer contacted Box I. To test whether an excess of UL9 protein can induce formation of a UL9 protein-Box I complex in which the two monomers are cross-linked to Box I, a 10-fold excess of UL9 protein was incubated with Box I and irradiated as before. These conditions are comparable to those used by Fierer and Challberg (17Fierer D.S. Challberg M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7330-7334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, only the 93-kDa complex was formed, similar to that observed with equimolar amounts of UL9 protein and Box I. We can therefore conclude that in agreement with Gustafsson et al.(21Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19028-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) only one of the two monomers of the UL9 dimer contacts the Box I sequence. To verify that the UL9 protein bound to Box I as a dimer, a mixture containing UL9 protein (120 pmol) and 32P-labeled Box I (60 pmol) was irradiated at 300 nm then subjected to Sephacryl 200 gel filtration. Two radiolabeled peaks appeared. The first eluted at a molecular mass of 200 kDa, which is consistent with the UL9 protein dimer and radiolabeled Box I. The second peak consisted of free Box I (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that although the UL9 protein binds Box I as a dimer, only one of the two monomers actually contacts Box I. This conclusion is supported by the finding that the electrophoretic mobility of the32P-labeled Box I substrate-UL9 protein complex was significantly increased upon treatment with SDS (data not shown). To examine the interaction between the UL9 protein and the Box I substrate during the unwinding reaction, increasing amounts of the UL9 protein were mixed with the Box I substrate and irradiated at 260 nm for 5 min, followed by heating at 90 °C for 10 min (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 4, two UL9 protein-Box I complexes were formed: The predominant one migrated with a molecular mass of 99 kDa and the second at 115 kDa. These forms correspond to a UL9 monomer cross-linked to the single-stranded 44-mer (13.3 kDa) and the UL9 monomer cross-linked to the duplex Box I (24.3 kDa). The latter likely resulted from some renaturation of the complementary single strands of the Box I substrate. These results demonstrate that as in the case of the fully duplex Box I, the Box I substrate contacted only one of the two UL9 monomers. Quantitation of the UL9 monomer-Box I complex formed showed that 2 pmol of UL9 homodimer was sufficient to saturate 2 pmol of the Box I substrate. As shown in Fig.5, maximal unwinding of the Box I substrate (2 pmol) also occurred in the presence of an equivalent amount of UL9 dimer (2 pmol). In these experiments, multiple unwinding events were prevented by the addition of limiting amounts (4 pmol) of ICP8, which is required in stoichiometric amounts (8Boehmer P.E. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1220-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 5Unwinding of Box I substrate by a UL9 protein-ICP8 complex. Increasing amounts of UL9 protein homodimer were incubated with 4 pmol of ICP8 and the Box I substrate (2 pmol). The reaction was initiated by addition of ATP (4 mm), and continued for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were electrophoresed through a 15% polyacrylamide gel as described under “Materials and Methods,” and the single-stranded DNA products were quantitated with a PhosphorImager.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Earlier studies (14Lee S.S.-K.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29329-29334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had shown, using a C-terminal deletion mutant of UL9, that a specific interaction between the C-terminal portion of the UL9 protein and ICP8 is required to unwind the Box I substrate. To better define the role of ICP8 in the unwinding reaction, we examined the effect of ICP8 on the UL9 monomer-Box I interaction using the photocross-linking assay. Equivalent amounts of UL9 homodimer and Box I substrate were incubated together with increasing amounts of ICP8 in the absence of ATP. As shown in Fig.6, the amount of UL9 protein-Box I complex formed following UV-cross-linking decreased significantly with increasing amounts of ICP8. The interaction between the UL9 protein and ICP8 also influenced the binding of ICP8 to the single-stranded DNA tails of the Box I substrate. As shown in Fig. 7, ICP8 interacted with the single-stranded DNA tails of the Box I substrate in the absence of UL9 protein. However, the amount of ICP8 cross-linked to the Box I substrate was increased 2–3-fold by the UL9 protein. In contrast, there was no effect of UL9 protein on the interaction of ICP8 with a single strand the same length (18 nucleotides) as the 3′ single-stranded DNA tail of the Box I substrate. There was also no effect of ICP8 on the binding of UL9 protein to the fully duplex Box I substrate (data not shown). The C-terminal 27 amino acids of the UL9 protein are required for maximal Oris-dependent DNA replication in vivo (22Boehmer P.E. Craigie M.C. Stow N.D. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29329-29334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They are also required for the interaction with ICP8, as well as the unwinding of Box I (14Lee S.S.-K. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To explore further this interaction on the unwinding of Box I, the effect of the antibody directed against the C-terminal 10 amino acids of the UL9 protein was examined. As shown in Fig. 8, preincubation of the UL9 protein with the antibody significantly inhibited unwinding. In contrast, antibody directed against full-length UL9 protein, which recognizes several native epitopes of the UL9 protein but not the C-terminal portion of the molecule, had no effect on unwinding (Fig. 8). Thus binding of the antibody to the C-terminal 10 amino acids of the UL9 protein prevents interaction between the UL9 protein and ICP8 and thereby inhibits unwinding. Addition of a peptide consisting of the C-terminal 10 amino acids of UL9 protein (UL9 CT10) prevented inhibition of Box I unwinding by the antibody, confirming that the inhibition results from an interaction between the UL9 protein bound to the Box I and the antibody directed against the peptide (Fig.9). Finally, when the antibody was added to a UL9 protein-Box I complex, followed by ICP8 and ATP, unwinding was completely inhibited (Fig. 8), suggesting that when the CT10 epitope of the UL9 protein is bound to the Box I substrate, it becomes more accessible to the antibody. These observations taken together confirm that the C-terminal portion of the UL9 protein, when bound to Box I, is required for its interaction with ICP8. They also suggest that the UL9 protein undergoes a significant conformational change upon binding Box I. Such a conformational change may be required to facilitate helicase activity. A model for the unwinding of the Box I element of Oris by the dimeric UL9 protein and ICP8, which encompasses these phenomena, is presented in Fig.10.Figure 9Effect of a synthetic peptide (UL9 CT10) on the inhibition of Box I unwinding by antibody directed against the C-terminal 10 amino acids of the UL9 protein. Increasing amounts of peptide were added to the reaction mixtures in the presence (●) or absence (■) of antibody.

Sec tRNAs are initially aminoacylated with serine by seryl-tRNA synthetase and are therefore designated Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec.

Several studies, in addition to the present one, are beginning to elucidate the role of selenium metabolism in Drosophila. For example, Perlaky et al. (12.Perlaky, S., Merritt, K., and Cavener, D.

March 25–29, 1998, Abstract 414C.Google Scholar) have shown that UGA occurs in the opening reading frame of Gld mRNA from several species of Drosophila, and these investigators have provided strong evidence that this UGA is a Sec codon. Two groups have reported a gene encoding a homologue of selenophosphate synthetase inDrosophila (13Persson B.C. Böck A. Jäckle H. Vorbrűggen G. J. Mol.

The present study was initiated to expand our understanding of selenium metabolism and, in particular, selenoprotein biosynthesis inDrosophila melanogaster by analyzing the Sec tRNA population. Like its counterpart in higher vertebrates,Drosophila Sec tRNA is aminoacylated with serine, forms selenocysteyl-tRNA, decodes UGA and, therefore, is designated Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec (2Lee B.J. Park S.I.

The Sec tRNA[Ser]Secpopulation was resolved into two major bands on polyacrylamide gels that appear to be the result of conformational and not structural changes.

Smaller quantities of Sec tRNAs were obtained from total tRNA for aminoacylation and coding studies by passing 3500A 260 units of tRNA over an RPC-5 column in 0.5m NaCl-buffer A, washing the column in this buffer until the A 260 units dropped below 1.0, and purifying Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec by two successive runs over the RPC-5 column as described (4Diamond A.M.

Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec was identified in all column fractions by northern hybridization (see “Experimental Procedures”). Ser tRNASer was identified from the BD-cellulose column (4Diamond A.M. Choi I.S.

SL2 cells were grown in serum-free insect medium (HyQ-CCMTM3 from HyClone Laboratories) to which sodium selenite was added to 1 μm. Cells (1.7 g wet weight) were collected at midlog, washed several times in medium without added selenium, and resuspended in 50 ml of fresh medium (without added selenium). The cells were labeled with 5 mCi of75Se, and the resulting 75Se-labeled tRNA was extracted and chromatographed on a RPC-5 column; the75Se-selenocysteyl-tRNA[Ser]Sec was isolated as described (20Hatfield D.L. Choi I.S. Mischke S. Owens L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Labeled aminoacyl-tRNAs were chromatographed on a RPC-5 column and responses of fractionated aminoacyl-tRNAs to trinucleoside diphosphate code words were examined by the ribosomal binding assay of Nirenberg and Leder (21Nirenberg M.

Samples were dot- or slot-blotted onto nitrocellulose filters or electrotransfered onto Hybond-N+ membranes in 0.3× 40 mmTris-acetate, 1 mm EDTA at 50 V for 18 h at 4 °C; the tRNA was cross-linked to filters or membranes with a UV StratalinkerTM 1800 cross-linker and was hybridized with QuikHybRHybridization Solution from Stratagene. Labeled probe was prepared by the protocol of Prime-ItRRmT Random Primer Labeling kit from Stratagene. After hybridization, membranes were washed 2× for 15 min each at room temperature in 0.2× SSC with 0.1% SDS and then 1× for 30 min at room temperature in 0.1× SSC with 0.1% SDS. The relative amounts of probe attached to filters or membranes in response to tRNA in northern hybridization assays were determined using a PhosphorImager. Polytene chromosomes from salivary glands of late, 3rd instar larvae of wild type D. melanogaster (Oregon R) were prepared for in situhybridization as described (23Pardue M.L. Gall J.G. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 10: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and probed with the 5-kilobaseBamHI fragment encoding the Sec tRNA gene. The nonradioactive digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe was prepared according to the method of random-primed labeling (24Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar), and hybridization and detection of the hybridized fragment were carried out by the procedures of Langer-Safer et al. (25Langer-Safer P.R. Levine M. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4381-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) and Schmidt et al.(26Schmidt E.R. Keyl H.-G. Hankeln T. Chromosoma (Berlin). 1988; 96: 353-359Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Purified Sec tRNAs were sequenced as described previously (4Diamond A.M. Choi I.S. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. Pomerantz S.C.

Cell. 1981; 25: 497-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and modified nucleosides were determined by combined liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/MS) as follows: tRNAs were digested totally to nucleosides using nuclease P1, phosphodiesterase I, and bacterial alkaline phosphatase as described (27Crain P.F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and the digest was injected directly into the liquid chromatograph without prior cleanup. Electrospray ionization LC/MS was conducted on a Fisons Quattro II mass spectrometer (Micromass, Inc., Beverly, MA) interfaced to a Hewlett-Packard 1090 liquid chromatograph. Chromatography was conducted on a 250 × 2 mm LC-18S column with 20 × 2 mm LC-18 precolumn (Supelco, Inc., Bellefonte, PA). The nucleoside mixture was fractionated using an ammonium acetate-acetonitrile gradient as described (28Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 796-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), except that the ammonium acetate concentration was decreased to 5 mm and the flow rate to 300 μl/min for compatibility with electrospray mass spectrometry. The entire effluent was conducted into the mass spectrometer without splitting; the interface temperature was 180 °C. Capillary and lens voltages were 2.8 and 0.25 kV, respectively. The mass range 105–400 was scanned in 0.4 s with a 0.1-s interscan delay. The cone voltage was ramped from 25 to 5 volts during the scan. Positive ions were detected. The 5′-ends of both Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec forms were examined by primer extending them to their 5′-termini using a 20-mer as template (see above) and determining the resulting length of the extended product by gel electrophoresis. To identify the Sec tRNA population within total tRNA, tRNA from Drosophila embryos was aminoacylated with [3H]serine in the presence of Drosophilaaminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The resulting [3H]seryl-tRNA was fractionated on a RPC-5 column as shown in Fig.1. The bulk of the labeled tRNA eluted from the column in fractions 36–60, whereas a minor peak eluted in fractions 72–75. Because vertebrate Sec tRNAs are more hydrophobic than the corresponding Ser tRNAs and they represent from about 1 to 5% of the Ser tRNA population (reviewed in Refs. 2Lee B.J. Park S.I. Park J.M. Chittum H.J. Hatfield D.L. Mol. Cell. 1996; 6: 509-520Google Scholar and 3Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Park J.M. Park S.I. Chittum H.S. Huh J.R. Carlson B.A. Kim M. Moustafa M.E. Lee B.J. Kelly J.W. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 4. Elsevier Science Ltd., Oxford, England1999: 353-380Google Scholar), we suspected that the minor later eluting peak represented the Sec tRNA population. To determine if this latter peak is Sec tRNA, column fractions were tested for their ability to hybridize to a 188-base pair fragment encoding the Drosophila Sec tRNA gene (11Lee B.J. Rajagopalan M. Kim Y.S. You K.-H. Jacobson K.B. Hatfield D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1940-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) by northern hybridization. The analysis confirmed that the minor later eluting peak represented the Sec tRNA population in Drosophila (see Fig.1). The Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec population represents 0.54% of the Ser tRNA population in Drosophila, which is lower than that found in mammalian cells and tissues (2Lee B.J. Park S.I. Park J.M. Chittum H.J. Hatfield D.L. Mol. Cell. 1996; 6: 509-520Google Scholar, 3Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Park J.M. Park S.I. Chittum H.S. Huh J.R. Carlson B.A. Kim M. Moustafa M.E. Lee B.J. Kelly J.W. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 4. Elsevier Science Ltd., Oxford, England1999: 353-380Google Scholar). To obtain sufficient quantities of Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec for determining its codon recognition properties, it was separated from the bulk of other tRNAs, including tRNASer, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec was aminoacylated with [3H]serine and chromatographed on a RPC-5 column, and the resulting single, homogeneous peak of [3H]seryl-tRNA[Ser]Sec, recognized UGA but not UGU, UGC, or UGG, which are codons with a degenerate base in the 3′-position, or the serine codons UCU, UCG, or AGU (data not shown). The data presented above show that Drosophila embryos contain a tRNA that is aminoacylated with serine, that specifically and efficiently decodes UGA in a ribosomal binding assay, and that hybridizes to the previously identified gene for Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec from this organism (11Lee B.J. Rajagopalan M. Kim Y.S. You K.-H. Jacobson K.B. Hatfield D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1940-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To obtain direct evidence that Drosophila contain selenocysteyl-tRNA[Ser}Sec, we utilized theDrosophila cell line, SL2 (29Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar). SL2 cells were labeled with75Se, and the resulting labeled tRNA was extracted and chromatographed on a RPC-5 column (Fig.2). Two 75Se-labeled tRNA isoacceptors were observed, a minor front-running peak followed by a major later eluting peak. Both 75Se-labeled tRNAs recognized UGA in a ribosomal binding assay as shown in the figure. The major eluting peak was deacylated, and the 75Se-labeled material was identified as Sec (data not shown). Because this tRNA is aminoacylated with serine and forms selenocysteyl-tRNA, it can be designated Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec like its counterpart in higher vertebrates. Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec purified by RPC-5 chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”) was used for aminoacylation and kinetic studies. The extent of aminoacylation of tRNA[Ser]Sec in the presence of either Drosophila or mammalian aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases was determined over a wide range of tRNA[Ser]Sec concentrations (data not shown). After 25 min of incubation, the extent of attachment of serine to tRNA[Ser]Sec was indistinguishable with homologous or heterologous synthetase. However, the rate of aminoacylation of Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec with serine was much faster withDrosophila than with mammalian synthetase (see Fig.3). The K m ofDrosophila Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec and Ser tRNASer for the homologous seryl-tRNA synthetase was determined. The K m for Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec was 6.67 nm and for Ser tRNASer it was 9.45 nm. TheK m for Ser tRNASer, which decodes UCU, UCC, and UCA, from bovine liver for rabbit reticulocyte seryl-tRNA synthetase was determined as a control and found to be 3.03 nm. Supplementation of the medium of cultured mammalian cells (6Hatfield D. Lee B.J. Hampton L. Diamond A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), of Xenopus oocytes (8Choi I.S. Diamond A.M. Crain P.F. Kolker J.D. McCloskey J.A. Hatfield D.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), or the diets of rats (4Diamond A.M. Choi I.S. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. Pomerantz S.C. Cruz R. Steer C. Hill K.E. Burk R.F.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14215-14223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with selenium enhances the level of the Sec tRNA[Ser]Secpopulation and causes a redistribution of the major Sec isoacceptors in cells and tissues. We therefore examined the effects of selenium on the Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec population in SL2 cells grown in culture (Fig. 4). SL2 cells were grown in varying levels of supplemented selenium, and the tRNA was extracted and examined by gel electrophoresis. Lane 1, which was included as a control, shows the resolution of two Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec forms by gel electrophoresis from adult flies. Lane 2 shows a single band of Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec from SL2 cells that corresponds to the lower running band in adult flies, indicating that cells grown in culture appeared to have little or none of the slower migrating band of Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec. These cells were grown in medium supplemented with nontoxic levels of sodium selenite (1 μm). Interestingly, higher levels of selenium that inhibited growth rate, and therefore are probably toxic to the cells, resulted in the appearance of the slower migrating band (lanes 3 and 4). Total tRNA isolated fromDrosophila at various stages of development, including embryonic, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd larval stages, pupae, and adult flies, manifested two bands of Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec as determined by gel electrophoresis (see Fig. 4 for adult flies). The amounts of these two bands did not appear to vary throughout development (data not shown). Transfer RNAs from both bands were isolated and purified from embryos as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and their primary structures were analyzed. Initially, both purified Sec tRNAs[Ser]Sec were analyzed by the partial formamide hydrolysis method previously used to determine the structure of bovine (19Diamond A.M. Dudock B. Hatfield D. Cell. 1981; 25: 497-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and rat Sec tRNAs[Ser]Sec(4Diamond A.M. Choi I.S. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. Pomerantz S.C. Cruz R. Steer C. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. McCloskey J.A. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14215-14223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In short, this procedure involves partial hydrolysis of purified tRNA, 5′-end labeling of the resulting 5′-hydroxyl termini, and resolution of the labeled “ladder” on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. A representative autoradiogram of such a gel is presented in Fig.5. Examination of the radioactive ladders indicated that the patterns are very similar, differing mainly in the higher molecular weight region. In addition to the bands seen in the faster migrating tRNA species, the pattern seen for the slower migrating species has a large radioactive band separated by a gap in the ladder. Furthermore, several bands within the patterns show different relative intensities that are indicated by anasterisk in the figure. This signifies differences in accessibility to cleavage by formamide and typically is an indication of different conformational states of the compared molecules. It is also noteworthy that neither pattern has a single gap at the position representing the wobble nucleoside within the anticodon, as would be expected if these tRNAs contained the modified residue mcm5Um in this position that was previously observed with one of the mammalian Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec isoacceptors (4Diamond A.M. Choi I.S. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. Pomerantz S.C. Cruz R. Steer C. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. McCloskey J.A. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14215-14223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the radioactive bands from the acrylamide gel was excised, as were others obtained from the same digest/labeling following electrophoresis for different times to optimally resolve the ladder and finally digested to 5′,3′-nucleotide diphosphates. Digested products were resolved by ascending chromatography on polyethyleneimine cellulose to obtain the primary sequence by comparison to the known mobilities of modified and nonmodified residues (30Silberklang M. Gillum A.M. RajBhandary U.L. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 59: 58-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). This analysis indicated that the primary sequence of both tRNAs was colinear with that reported for the Drosophila Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec gene (11Lee B.J. Rajagopalan M. Kim Y.S. You K.-H. Jacobson K.B. Hatfield D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1940-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Only three modified residues were identified in this manner, mcm5U at position 34, i6A at position 37, and ψ at position 55, in both characterized molecules (Fig. 6). Autoradiograms of representative polyethyleneimine plates are shown for the TψCG loop, variable region (Fig. 6 A), and the region including the anticodon (Fig. 6 B). The identities of modified nucleoside diphosphates were confirmed by further digestion with nuclease P1 and two dimensional chromatography as described previously for the same modified residues (data not shown) (see Refs. 4Diamond A.M. Choi I.S. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. Pomerantz S.C. Cruz R. Steer C. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. McCloskey J.A. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol.

The modified residue content of both tRNA[Ser]Sec forms was verified by electrospray ionization LC/MS (Fig. 7). Modified nucleoside identities were established from mass spectra and characteristic relative retention times (5Amberg R. Urban C. Reuner B. Scharff P. Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. Gross H.J.

In agreement with results from direct sequencing of both tRNAs, only three modified nucleosides are present in each tRNA: ψ, mcm5U, and i6A.Figure 7Chromatogram (UV absorbance at 260 nm) from LC/MS analysis of modified nucleosides in electrophoretically separated tRNA [Ser] Sec species. A, faster migrating tRNA; B, slower migrating tRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The analyses described above failed to determine a structural explanation for the different mobilities of the two Sec tRNA species detected by electrophoresis of Drosophila embryo tRNA. Clearly, the molecules are identical for the 90 nucleotides resolved by our techniques. Furthermore, 5′-end labeling of both tRNAs and complete digestion with ribonuclease T1 resulted in labeled fragments of indistinguishable mobility, consistent with the previously reported sequence of the Drosophila Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec gene. Elongation of both tRNA[Ser]Sec forms to their 5′-ends by primer extension (see “Experimental Procedures”) revealed that each contained the same number of nucleotides in this region, suggesting that these ends of both molecules were identical. Based on the collective data, we propose that the observed differences in mobility of the Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec species in embryos and in SL2 cells when they are exposed to high concentrations of selenium (Fig. 4) are because of altered conformational states of these molecules. This conclusion is supported by the observed differences in formamide cleavage susceptibility reported above. However, determination of the factors involved in the stabilization of the molecules between the conformational states will require further investigation. The Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec gene occurs in single copy in the Drosophila genome (11Lee B.J. Rajagopalan M. Kim Y.S. You K.-H. Jacobson K.B. Hatfield D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1940-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A 5-kilobase BamHI fragment encoding Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec was used as a probe to determine the location of the gene within the genome of Drosophila. As shown in Fig. 8, the gene maps to a single site on chromosome 2 in region 47E or F. Species representative of the three primary domains, archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes (31Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4576-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (4535) Google Scholar), recognize the UGA triplet as the codon for Sec (32Hatfield D.L. Diamond A.M. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 69-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because Sec tRNAs[Ser]Sec are essential for both Sec biosynthesis and the subsequent incorporation of this amino acid into selenoproteins, we have chosen to examine tRNA[Ser]Sec in an eukaryotic organism that is both evolutionarily distant from mammals yet amenable to study either as a whole organism or as an established cell line. Herein, we demonstrate that Drosophila contains a Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec, which is aminoacylated with serine, and that the seryl-tRNA[Ser]Sec is converted to selenocysteyl-tRNA[Ser]Sec, which is capable of specifically recognizing UGA in a ribosomal binding assay. In this respect, this process is similar to that observed in bacteria and mammals. Drosophila represents the lowest eukaryote from which the direct sequence analysis of a Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec has been determined. The sequence presented within this study is colinear with the gene sequence previously reported (11Lee B.J. Rajagopalan M. Kim Y.S. You K.-H. Jacobson K.B. Hatfield D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1940-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We have detected only three modified nucleosides, ψ, i6A, and mcm5U, although it remains possible that other modifications occur in a fraction of the tRNA population that is below the limits of our detection. Although we detect two distinct Sec tRNAs by electrophoresis of Drosophila tRNA derived from embryos and numerous other stages of development, only one species was detected in this manner from cultured cells. On the other hand, two peaks of selenocysteyl-tRNA[Ser]Sec from SL2 cells were resolved by RPC-5 chromatography when the cells were labeled with75Se. This observation suggests the existence of multiple species of Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec in SL2 cells, which may differ either in base modification or in their primary sequences that might also occur in developing tissues but are below our limits of detection during sequencing procedures. It is possible that the multiple forms of Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec analyzed in embryos are present in different cell types, whereas only one form is seen in SL2 cells by electrophoresis because of its clonagenic origin. Our analyses of these two forms clearly demonstrate that they do not differ because of 2′-O-methylation of mcm5U, as seen in mammalian cells and tissues. This would have been evident from the partial formamide hydrolysis procedure (Fig. 5) or from modified nucleoside analysis by LC/MS (Fig. 7). As we have been unable to detect either a difference in primary sequence or base modification of these Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec forms, we hypothesize that the distinct electrophoretic mobilities are because of a conformational difference between these molecules. Although the basis for the stabilization might occur during the initial folding of the molecules or by association with as yet undetectable molecules, we note that incubation of SL2 cells at toxic concentrations of selenium appears to stimulate the conversion of the single species of Sec tRNA[Ser]Secin cells to one with the mobility observed for the slower migrating species detected in embryos. Because mammalian Sec tRNAs respond to selenium with a shift in the distribution of the mcm5U species to that containing mcm5Um and an accompanying change in conformation (4Diamond A.M. Choi I.S. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. Pomerantz S.C. Cruz R. Steer C. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. McCloskey J.A. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14215-14223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our observation on the SL2 Sec tRNA response to selenium may represent a primordial response, which accomplishes the same end. Future studies are directed toward the determination of the biological roles for distinct Sec tRNAs[Ser]Sec observed in eukaryotes. In summary, the investigation of the selenoprotein biosynthesis machinery in Drosophila has revealed features both in common with and distinct from that already described for other eukaryotes. The general principle that this process requires a dedicated, relatively undermodified tRNA that is the site of selenocysteine synthesis from serine and decodes UGA is demonstrated for this species as well. The lack of any Sec tRNA species including either the 1-methyladenosine or mcm5Um modifications, as well as the conformational response to selenium status described above, suggests that the study of selenium metabolism in Drosophila will yield novel insights into the evolution of the translation of selenium-containing proteins. In addition, the relatively low abundance of Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec in Drosophila (Fig. 1) as compared with higher vertebrates (2Lee B.J. Park S.I. Park J.M. Chittum H.J. Hatfield D.L. Mol. Cell. 1996; 6: 509-520Google Scholar, 3Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Park J.M. Park S.I. Chittum H.S. Huh J.R. Carlson B.A. Kim M. Moustafa M.E. Lee B.J. Kelly J.W.

https://openalex.org/W2041351885,"We have identified a cDNA that encodes a variant form of murine syndecan-1. The variant cDNA lacks the sequence corresponding to the first 132 nucleotides of the third exon of the syndecan-1 gene. The corresponding message is rare. The alternative splice respects the reading frame and deletes 44 amino acids from the protein, joining the S45GS47GT sequence to a variant immediate downstream context. This sequence context initiates with alanine instead of glycine as residue 50, reducing the number of SGXG sequence motifs in the protein from two to one. Expression of this variant syndecan-1 in Madin-Darby canine kidney or MOLT-4 cells yielded a recombinant proteoglycan with a reduced number and clustering of the heparan sulfate chains. Both the conversions of Ala50 and of Lys53 into glycine enhanced the heparan sulfate substitution of the variant protein. These findings support the concept that serine-glycine dipeptide signals for glycosaminoglycan/heparan sulfate synthesis depend on sequence context (Zhang, L., David, G., and Esko, J. D. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 27127–27135) and imply that alternative splicing mechanisms may in part control the molecular polymorphism of syndecan-1 and, therefore, the efficiency and versatility of this protein in its co-receptor functions. We have identified a cDNA that encodes a variant form of murine syndecan-1. The variant cDNA lacks the sequence corresponding to the first 132 nucleotides of the third exon of the syndecan-1 gene. The corresponding message is rare. The alternative splice respects the reading frame and deletes 44 amino acids from the protein, joining the S45GS47GT sequence to a variant immediate downstream context. This sequence context initiates with alanine instead of glycine as residue 50, reducing the number of SGXG sequence motifs in the protein from two to one. Expression of this variant syndecan-1 in Madin-Darby canine kidney or MOLT-4 cells yielded a recombinant proteoglycan with a reduced number and clustering of the heparan sulfate chains. Both the conversions of Ala50 and of Lys53 into glycine enhanced the heparan sulfate substitution of the variant protein. These findings support the concept that serine-glycine dipeptide signals for glycosaminoglycan/heparan sulfate synthesis depend on sequence context (Zhang, L., David, G., and Esko, J. D. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 27127–27135) and imply that alternative splicing mechanisms may in part control the molecular polymorphism of syndecan-1 and, therefore, the efficiency and versatility of this protein in its co-receptor functions. Syndecan-1 is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan that is subject to strong developmental regulations (1Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Loose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). The protein is expressed in spatiotemporal- and cell type-specific patterns and shows, in addition, tissue- and cell-specific differences in glycosylation. This variable glycosylation pertains to the number, size, and fine structure of the glycosaminoglycan chains that substitute the protein (glycanation) and yields a highly polymorphic proteoglycan (2Sanderson R.D. Bernfield M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9562-9566Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 3Kato M. Wang H. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms that regulate this variation are not fully understood, but the differences in glycanation can change the binding properties of the proteoglycan (3Kato M. Wang H. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sanderson R.D. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Lander A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13100-13106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and the syndecans in particular, are thought to function as co-receptors for various ligands that control cell shape, adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation, these differences in glycanation could be developmentally significant (1Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Loose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Analysis of the glycanation of syndecan-1 from mouse mammary epithelial cells has indicated that substitution with heparan sulfate is limited to serines in the N-terminal half of the protein (5Kokenyesi R. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12304-12309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies, in Chinese hamster ovary cells, of recombinant chimeric proteoglycans that contained various segments of syndecan-1, and mutations of these segments have identified three serines, occurring in the sequence DGS35GDDSDNFS45GS47GTG, as the sites that prime heparan sulfate synthesis in this protein (6Zhang L. David G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27127-27135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The strongest sites for heparan sulfate synthesis in these experiments consisted of the repeat unit S45GS47G, and evidence was obtained for a coupling phenomenon across adjacent Ser-Gly dipeptides that enhances the substitution of these repeats with heparan sulfate. The same studies demonstrated that the synthesis of heparan sulfate on these serines also depended on adjacent clusters of acidic residues and identified the sequence (Ser-Gly)n (n≥2) and a nearby cluster of acidic residues ((D/E)n(n ≥3) within 6 residues) as a structural motif that is shared by many of the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (6Zhang L. David G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27127-27135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This motif incorporates a consensus peptide structure (acidic amino acids closely followed by the tetrapeptide SGXG) identified in prior studies as an efficient acceptor for xylosyltransferase, the enzyme that initiates the assembly of glycosaminoglycan chains (7Bourdon M.A. Krusius T. Campbell S. Schwartz N. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3194-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In syndecan-1 this acceptor motif is realized twice in the sequence S45GS47GTG, which is encoded by the junction of the second and third exons (TCT GGC TCT GGC ACA (G/G)T) of the syndecan-1 gene (8Hinkes M.T. Goldberger O.A. Neumann P.E. Kokenyesi R. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11440-11448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Vihinen T. Auvinen P. Alanen-Kurki L. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17261-17269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the upstream sequence DDSDNF that immediately flanks the Ser-Gly repeat. We now report a variant cDNA for murine syndecan-1 that likely results from the use of an alternative splice acceptor site. The alternative splicing process skips part of the third exon but respects the reading frame and, upon translation, is predicted to bring the S45GS47GT sequence in a variant immediate downstream sequence context. Expression of this syndecan-1 cDNA in MDCK 1The abbreviations used are: MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; bp, base pair; nt, nucleotide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HS, heparan sulfate. and MOLT-4 cells indicates that, in comparison to the more common or “standard” form of this protein, the variant protein is less substituted with heparan sulfate and that the clustering of the heparan sulfate chains is disrupted in this proteoglycan. Conversion of the S45GS47GTA sequence in the splice variant into S45GS47GTG enhances the glycosaminoglycan substitution of this protein and restores the clustering of the heparan sulfate chains in the proteoglycan. These findings support the concept that the strengths of Ser-Gly dipeptides as signals for heparan sulfate synthesis depend on sequence context and imply that alternative splicing mechanisms may in part control the molecular polymorphism of syndecan-1 and the efficiency and versatility of this protein in its co-receptor functions. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from whole 14-day-old NMRI mouse embryos, annealed to oligo(dT), and used as template for the synthesis of cDNA by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (10David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. Development. 1993; 119: 841-854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences coding for mouse syndecan-1 were amplified from this cDNA by PCR. The PCR mixture contained 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 1× Taq buffer (16.6 mm ammonium sulfate, 67 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, 6.7 mm MgCl2, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 6.7 μm EDTA, 170 μg/ml of BSA), 10% Me2SO, 1 ng of cDNA, 1.5 mm dNTP, and 1.4 μm primer. The sense and antisense primers (Fig. 1) were 42-mers identical, respectively, to the murine syndecan cDNA sequence (from residue 240 to 281) and to the complement of this sequence (from residue 1131 to 1172), as reported by Saunders et al. (11Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). After 40 thermal cycles (1 min denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min annealing at 55 °C, and 1 min extension at 68 °C), the amplification products were analyzed in 1.1% agarose gels and detected by ethidium bromide staining. The amplification products were electro-eluted, ethanol-precipitated, phosphorylated, and ligated in the SmaI restriction site of pGEM-3Z (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). After propagation in XL1-Blue cells, several independent recombinant plasmids were analyzed. Variant insert of only ∼800 bp (MoSyn-1/7) and insert of the expected standard size of 933 bp (MoSyn-1/6) were further characterized by restriction site mapping and completely sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (12Sanger F. Nicklem S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar), using supercoiled plasmid, a modified T7 DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), T7 and SP6 primers, and both dGTP and C7-deaza-dGTP. The expression of the variant mouse syndecan-1 message was analyzed by a ribonuclease protection assay kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). [32P]UTP-labeled antisense RNA complementary to the standard mouse syndecan-1 message was synthesized with SP6 RNA polymerase. The template was a SalI-linearized pGEM3Z plasmid that contained a 427-bp PstI-SphI fragment from the MoSyn-1/6 insert (spanning from residue 288 to 714 of the sequence published by Saunders et al. (11Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar)). The antisense probe (of a predicted size of 446 nt) was hybridized to 10 μg of total RNA isolated from various mouse tissues, digested with RNase, and sized in a sequencing gel. A 314-nt antisense RNA probe complementary to the variant message was synthesized from a pGEM3Z plasmid that contained a 295-bp PstI-SphI fragment from the MoSyn-1/7 insert. To provide the cDNAs with Kozak sequences, the segments spanning from the PstI to the StyI restriction sites of the MoSyn-1/7 and MoSyn-1/6 inserts were exchanged for the corresponding segments of a full-length cDNA coding for human syndecan-1, cloned in pBluescript SK−. The segments of these chimeric constructs that spanned from the (blunted)KpnI site in the multiple cloning site of the pBS vector to the XbaI restriction site in the human cDNA were then cloned in pRc/RSV plasmids (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands), using the blunted BstXI and the XbaI sites of this vector. Sequencing verified that the resulting Syn-1s and Syn-1v pRc/RSV plasmids were coding for peptides that corresponded, respectively, to the predicted products of the MoSyn-1/6 (standard) and MoSyn-1/7 (variant) cDNAs. The primers 5′-C TCT GGA TCT GGA ACA GGA GGA GAG AAG CC and 5′-CA GCC GGA GAA GGA CCA GAA GAA GGA GAG CCT GTG C and the corresponding complementary primers, in combination with T3 and T7 primers, were used in a two-step ligation PCR procedure, to convert the SGSGTA 50GEK 53PEEGEPV sequence in the variant syndecan-1 protein into, respectively, SGSGTG 50GEKPEEGEPV and SGSGTAGEG 53PEEGEPV (where boldface indicates the substitution). The Syn-1s and Syn-1v expression plasmids were linearized with BglII and introduced in MDCK or MOLT-4 cells by electroporation. For the transfections, the cells were prewashed with Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS, incubated for 10 min at 4 °C (107 cells in 1 ml) with 30 μg of linearized plasmid, and electroporated at 240 V and 960 microfarads (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad). Selection was started 48 h later, using 500 μg/ml G418. Stable transfectant syndecan-expressing MDCK clones were identified by immunoblotting. Syndecan-1 expressing MOLT-4 cells were isolated by panning on anti-syndecan-1 antibody (mAb281-2) or anti-heparan sulfate antibody (mAb 10E4) and characterized by immunoblotting, quantitative immunocytofluorometry, and adhesion tests. Transfectant cells were extracted with Triton X-100 buffer, and proteoglycan was purified from the extracts by absorption on DEAE-Trisacryl M (13Lories V. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7009-7016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant syndecan-1 eluted from DEAE was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gradient or 4% Nusieve agarose-gel electrophoresis and Western blotting, directly or after separation from endogenous proteoglycan by immunopurification on mAb 281-2 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Before electrophoresis, the proteoglycan samples were treated with heparitinase, chondroitinase ABC, both enzymes, or left untreated (13Lories V. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7009-7016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were stained with the mouse syndecan-1-specific mAb 281-2 (14Jalkanen M. Nguyen H. Rapraeger A. Kurn N. Bernfield M.R. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), mAb 2E9 (specific for the cytoplasmic domains of the syndecans 1 and 3) (12Sanger F. Nicklem S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar), or with the ΔHS-specific mAb 3G10 (15David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Cassiman J.J. Van Den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Transfectant MOLT-4 cells were analyzed for cell-surface expression of syndecan-1 protein and heparan sulfate by flow immunocytometry, using the antibodies 281-2, 10E4, and 3G10 as described before (16Steinfeld R. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The analyses were performed on a FACSort (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA), and data were analyzed with the program Lysis II. Cell binding to type I collagen from rat tails (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) was performed in polyvinyl 96-well U-bottom plates (Corning Costar Europe, Badhoevedorp, Netherlands), using a modified version of the method of Koda et al. (17Koda J.E. Rapraeger A. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8157-8162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Collagen coats were made by overnight incubation at 4 °C (100–300 μg of collagen in 1 ml of a 2:1 (v/v) mixture of 10 mm acetic acid/PBS, pH 4.4, per well). After removal of the non-absorbed collagen solution, the wells were rinsed twice with 0.3% BSA (Sigma, Bornem, Belgium) in Dulbecco's PBS (Life Technologies, Inc., Merelbeke, Belgium) and overcoated for 1 h at room temperature with 1% heat-denatured BSA in PBS. MOLT-4 cell cultures were split at a concentration of 3 × 105 cells/ml, 24 h before the cell binding assays. Just prior to the assay, the cells were labeled with the vital cytoplasmic fluorescent dye calcein AM (Molecular Probes Europe, Leiden, Netherlands), according to Braut-Boucher et al.(18Braut-Boucher F. Pichon J. Rat P. Adolphe M. Aubery M. Font J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 178: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Cells, washed twice with DMEM/F12 (1:1) medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), were suspended at 2 × 106cells/ml in Dulbecco's PBS, 1% BSA and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 25 μm (from a 1 mm stock in Me2SO) calcein AM in PBS, 0.5% BSA. Labeled cells were added to the coated microtiter wells (100 μl) at 5 × 105 cells/ml (in PBS, 1% BSA) and allowed to settle for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the microtiter plates were centrifuged at 1000–4000 rpm for 5–15 min in a Heraeus Minifuge 2 and scanned by a Fluorimager. The effect of heparin on cell adhesion was tested by preincubating the collagen-coated wells for 30 min with 100 μg/ml porcine intestinal heparin (Sigma) in PBS and adding 100 μg/ml heparin to the medium during the adhesion assay. By using primers corresponding to the published N-terminal and C-terminal amino acid sequences of murine syndecan-1 (11Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), we isolated two distinctive reverse transcription-PCR products from 14-day total mouse embryo RNA: the expected standard product of 933 bp (corresponding to residues 240–1172 of the published murine cDNA sequence) and a “variant” shorter product. Sequencing indicated that the shorter product was missing 132 bp, corresponding to residues 388–519 of the published cDNA sequence (Fig. 1). The boundaries of the missing sequence complied with the so-called GT-AG rule for splice site selection, suggestive of alternative splicing of the syndecan-1 gene transcript. The putative splice variant lacked the nucleotide sequence located just downstream of the nucleotides encoding the S45GS47GT amino acid sequence, which contains the two serines identified as the major attachment sites for heparan sulfate in this protein (6Zhang L. David G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27127-27135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The removal of these 132 bases respected the reading frame, joining the S45GS47GT sequence to alanine (Ala94 in the original sequence) instead of glycine as residue 50, followed by the sequence GEKPEEGE. Thus, the splice reduced the number of SGXG motifs in the protein and generated a novel immediate downstream context for the Ser-Gly repeat, rich in acidic amino acids but also containing a charged residue. To assess the relative abundance of the variant message, we performed ribonuclease protection assays on total and poly(A)+ RNAs from different embryonic and adult mouse tissues. By using a 446-ntin vitro antisense transcript for the standard form of mouse syndecan-1, we observed a major protected band with the size of a 430-nt fragment, consistent with the prediction for the standard syndecan-1 mRNA. Alignment of the probe with the variant cDNA predicted that protection by the alternatively spliced RNA should yield fragments of 200 and 101 nucleotides. Fragments of this size were present in 15-day mouse embryonic lung and adult lung RNA but remained nearly undetectable in 15-day total mouse embryo or adult liver RNA, even after prolonged exposures (Fig. 2). The ratio of the higher (430) versus the lower (200 + 101) bands was at least 10:1, indicating that the alternatively spliced message represented at most a minor population of the total syndecan-1 message in these tissues and a fortiori the whole embryo. The long exposure autoradiograms revealed several additional discrete protected bands that could not be accounted for by the currently identified syndecan-1 cDNAs. These bands were not due to contaminating cDNA in the probe, since the probe was completely degraded in the absence of added RNA. These extra bands might represent additional splice variants or unspliced RNAs, but this possibility was not further investigated. In Northern blot experiments, cDNA probes for the standard and the alternatively spliced forms of mouse syndecan-1 and also a 131-bp probe corresponding to the fragment that was missing in the splice variant, all recognized both the 2.6- and 3.4-kb messages for this proteoglycan, in a similar 3:1 relative abundance as described previously (not shown). Prior studies have identified the serine in the tetrapeptide sequence SGXG as an efficient in vitro xylosyltransferase acceptor and acidic amino acids at the N-terminal side of this SGXG sequence as enhancers of the recognition and substitution of the serine by xylosyltransferase (7Bourdon M.A. Krusius T. Campbell S. Schwartz N. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3194-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Consistently, acidic residues appear to be part of the consensus structure for attachment of glycosaminoglycans to proteins (7Bourdon M.A. Krusius T. Campbell S. Schwartz N. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3194-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), whereas clusters of acidic residues adjacent to coupled Ser-Gly dipeptides appear to be part of the consensus structures for heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan attachment (6Zhang L. David G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27127-27135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The variant syndecan-1 cDNA coded for S45GS47GTA instead of S45GS47GTG (one instead of two partially overlapping SGXG tetrapeptide sequences), flanked by a more acidic downstream context, suggesting that the splice potentially influenced the number, type, or structure of the glycosaminoglycan (chondroitin or heparan sulfate) chains that were bound to the core protein. We have analyzed this possibility by constructing Syn-1s and Syn-1v pRc/RSV expression vectors encoding, respectively, the standard and variant (alternatively spliced) forms of murine syndecan-1 (see “Experimental Procedures”) and expressing both these proteins in MDCK cells. Figs. 3 and4 show results of Western blotting experiments with these cells.Figure 4Recombinant murine syndecans expressed in MDCK and MOLT-4 cells. MDCK and MOLT-4 cells were transfected with pRc/RSV/Syn-1s (SYN-1S) or pRc/RSV/Syn1-v (SYN-1V). Total proteoglycan extracts from these cells were digested (+) or not digested (−) with heparitinase (Hase) and chondroitinase ABC (Case) and were fractionated by electrophoresis in SDS gels. The Western blots of these gels were stained with mAb 281-2, directed at the ectodomain of murine syndecan-1 (top panel). Murine syndecan-1, isolated from the detergent extracts of the MDCK cells by immunopurification on mAb 2E9 and mAb 281-2, and total proteoglycan from MOLT-4 cells were treated as above. The Western blots of these gels were stained with mAb 3G10, directed at ΔHS, the desaturated uronate that caps the remnant of each heparan sulfate chain after heparitinase digestion (bottom panel). All lanes were normalized for 281-2 epitope content. The highM r materials remaining after the combined digestion of syndecan-1v in MOLT-4 cells may be due to some aggregation of the core protein, a propensity that is common to all syndecan proteins. This phenomenon is concentration-dependent and was not noted in other experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Non-transfectant MDCK cells expressed a syndecan-1-related proteoglycan, as indicated by the mouse monoclonal antibody 2E9, which is specific for the evolutionarily highly conserved (and structurally very similar) cytoplasmic domains of the syndecans-1 and -3. This syndecan carried some chondroitin sulfate but mostly heparan sulfate. It yielded a core of ∼74 kDa after heparitinase treatment and slightly higher yields of this protein after combined heparitinase and chondroitinase ABC digestions, behaving as a heparan sulfate or heparan sulfate-rich hybrid proteoglycan (Fig. 3). This canine syndecan was not detected by the rat anti-mouse syndecan-1 antibody 281-2, which is directed against the evolutionarily less conserved ectodomain of this protein (not shown), but most likely represents syndecan-1 (syndecan-3 is not expressed in these cells). MDCK cells transfected with Syn-1s cDNA (encoding the standard form of murine syndecan-1) produced both 281-2-reactive (Fig. 4) and 2E9-reactive proteoglycans (Fig. 3). The properties of the 281-2-reactive (transfectant) and the 2E9-reactive (transfectant and endogenous) proteoglycan species were quite similar (although not completely identical) and reminiscent of the properties of the 2E9-reactive endogenous syndecan expressed by non-transfectant cells. Chondroitinase ABC reduced the amount of syndecan trapped at the interface of the stacking and separating gels but yielded no discrete immunoreactive bands in the separating gels, indicating that these chondroitinase-digested syndecans were still polydisperse. The effect of the chondroitinase ABC treatment, however, was more marked on the 281-2-reactive (transfectant) forms than on the 2E9-reactive (transfectant and endogenous) forms. Heparitinase-treated syndecans still migrated as a smear or stagger of bands, with small yields of ∼74-kDa core protein. Clearly, in relative terms, the heparitinase digestion of the transfectant syndecan (281-2-reactive) yielded less ∼74-kDa core protein than the heparitinase digestion of the endogenous syndecan (2E9-reactive) in the non-transfectant cells. Combined heparitinase and chondroitinase ABC digestions yielded single 2E9- or 281-2-reactive core proteins of ∼74 kDa. These results indicated that transfectant syndecan-1s was primarily a heparan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate hybrid proteoglycan with a core protein of ∼74 kDa. MDCK cells transfected with Syn-1v (the variant murine syndecan-1) cDNA also produced 2E9 and 281-2-reactive proteoglycan, but the properties of the 281-2-reactive (Fig. 4) and the 2E9-reactive (Fig. 3) syndecans were dissimilar and different from the syndecans expressed in non-transfectant cells or in cells transfected with Syn-1s cDNA. The 281-2-reactive (transfectant) proteoglycan in Syn-1v cells entered the separating gels to a larger extent than the 2E9-reactive (transfectant + endogenous syndecan-1) proteoglycan in the same cells, the 2E9 or 281-2-reactive proteoglycan in the cells transfected with Syn-1s, or the 2E9-reactive proteoglycan (endogenous syndecan-1) in non-transfectants. After treatment with only chondroitinase ABC, a substantial fraction of the 2E9-reactive syndecan-1 and an even larger fraction of the 281-2-reactive syndecan-1 migrated as a broad band of ∼70–120 kDa and small amounts as a discrete ∼56-kDa band. Single heparitinase digestion yielded a broad band of ∼65–100 kDa and a sharp band of ∼56 kDa that reacted with the mAbs 2E9 and 281-2, but the 56-kDa band was more conspicuous in the 281-2-staining than in the 2E9-staining reaction. Combined heparitinase and chondroitinase ABC digestions yielded two sharp bands of ∼74 and ∼56 kDa that reacted with mAb 2E9, and only one band of ∼56 kDa that reacted with mAb 281-2. Single enzyme digestions produced also more important band shifts and resulted in more quantitative transfers of immunostainable proteoglycan than observed for the endogenous syndecan-1 in non-transfectants and for transfectant syndecan-1 in cells transfected with Syn-1s. These results indicated that transfectant syndecan-1v represented a mixture of heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and heparan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate hybrid proteoglycans all built on a core protein of ∼56 kDa. The standard (s) and variant (v) forms of murine syndecan-1 were then isolated from the corresponding metabolically labeled transfectant MDCK cells, by immunopurification on mAb 2E9, and were separated from copurifying endogenous syndecan-1 by further immunopurification on the rat monoclonal (281-2) antibody specific for the ectodomain of murine syndecan-1. Mab 2E9 was also used to isolate syndecan-1 from non-transfectant MDCK cells. Heparitinase and chondroitinase susceptibility tests indicated that the35S-labeled recombinant syndecan-1v was more susceptible to chondroitinase ABC than recombinant syndecan-1s and endogenous syndecan-1 from non-transfectant MDCK cells (Fig.5). Sizing of the HS chains, released by alkali, and of the HS chain clusters, prepared by extensive protease K digestion of the chondroitinase ABC-pretreated proteoglycans, was performed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6) and by gel filtration (not shown). The recombinant syndecan-1v yielded protein-free HS chains (alkali release) that were slightly smaller (average size of ∼20 kDa) than the HS chains from recombinant syndecan-1s (average size of ∼22 kDa) and the chains from the endogenous syndecan-1 isolated from non-transfectant MDCK cells (average size of ∼25 kDa). When prepared by protease K treatment, most of the HS from the endogenous syndecan in non-transfectants cells and most of the HS from the recombinant syndecan-1s migrated with apparent sizes of ∼68 kDa. Most of the HS from syndecan-1v, in contrast, migrated with an apparent size of ∼20 kDa, indistinguishable from the size of the protein-free chains (obtained by alkali) from this proteoglycan. These results indicated that most of the endogenous and standard transfectant syndecan-1 core proteins were substituted with at least two HS chains that occurred mostly together in a protease K-resistant cluster, whereas the core proteins encoded by the variant message were substituted with only one chain or with several chains that were separated by a protease K-susceptible domain.Figure 6Size and clustering of the heparan sulfate chains in syndecan-1.

Recently, Vega et al.proposed that exogenous prothymosin α can specifically increase the phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF-2) in extracts of NIH3T3 cells (Vega, F. V., Vidal, A., Hellman, U., Wernstedt, C., and Domı́nguez, F. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 10147–10152). Using similar lysates prepared by four methods (detergent lysis, Dounce homogenization, digitonin permeabilization, and sonication) and three preparations of prothymosin α, one of which was purified by gentle means (the native protein, and a histidine-tagged recombinant prothymosin α expressed either in bacteria or in COS cells), we failed to find a response. A reconstituted system composed of eEF-2, recombinant eEF-2 kinase, calmodulin, and calcium was also unaffected by prothymosin α. However, unlike our optimized buffer, Vega's system included a phosphatase inhibitor, 50 mm fluoride, which when evaluated in our laboratories severely reduced phosphorylation of all species. Under these conditions, any procedure that decreases the effective fluoride concentration will relieve the inhibition and appear to activate. Our data do not support a direct relationship between the function of prothymosin α and the phosphorylation of eEF-2. Prothymosin α is a small, acidic, essential nuclear protein that plays a poorly defined role in the proliferation and survival of mammalian cells.

Our data do not support a direct relationship between the function of prothymosin α and the phosphorylation of eEF-2. The detailed function of prothymosin α remains cryptic and controversial. The protein is not, as its name intimates, a precursor for much smaller, processed, thymic hormones (1Eschenfeldt W.H. Berger S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several laboratories have noted (i) that an increase of greater than 10-fold in the mRNA and the protein occurs when quiescent cells proliferate, (ii) that the amount of prothymosin α in a tissue mirrors its inherent growth rate, and (iii) that prothymosin α is expressed in a chronologically contemporaneous manner with other growth related molecules such as Myc, histone H3, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (1Eschenfeldt W.H.

However, the most compelling evidence comes from synchronized human myeloma cells, which, when exposed to antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides directed toward prothymosin α mRNA at several locations, undergo growth arrest (25Sburlati A.R. Manrow R.E. Berger S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The particulars of prothymosin α's function are contested. The amino acid sequence, which should provide clues, is essentially unique. Except for a “classical” bipartite nuclear localization signal included in many otherwise unrelated nuclear proteins, the only shared featured is a reiterated region of glutamic acid residues found also in the Xenopus chromatin remodeling protein, nucleoplasmin (26Bürglin T.R. Mattaj I.W. Newmeyer D.D. Zeller R. De Robertis E.M. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,27Dingwall C. Dilworth S.M. Black S.J. Kearsey S.E. Cox L.S. Laskey R.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Binding studies in vitro have targeted various histones as binding partners, including core histones or histones H1, H3, and H4 depending on the conditions (28Dı́az-Jullien C. Pérez-Éstez A. Covelo G. Freire M. Biochim. et Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1296: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas an examination of a single clone of HL-60 cells permanently transfected with the prothymosin α gene suggested that excess prothymosin α might deplete and sequester nucleosomal histone H1 (29Rodrı́guez P. Viñuela J.E. Alvarez-Fernández L. Buceta M. Vidal A. Domı́nguez F. Gómez-Márquez J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, prothymosin α did not bind to histone H1-containing chromatin or to mononucleosomes in related studies (30Papamarcaki T. Tsolas O. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 31Karetsou Z. Sandaltzopoulos R. Frangou-Lazaridis M. Lai C.Y. Tsolas O. Becker P.B. Papamarcaki T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3111-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Kubota et al. demonstrated the binding of prothymosin α to the activation domain of the human immunodeficiency virus protein, rev, and the human T-cell leukemia virus protein, rex, in vitro(32Kubota S. Adachi Y. Copeland T.D. Oroszlan S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since rev is involved in the export of incompletely spliced viral RNA from the nucleus, it is tempting to speculate that prothymosin α interacts with a rev-like protein produced in normal cells and that its role is to assist in the export of RNA or protein from the mammalian nucleus. This view of prothymosin α as a facilitator of nuclear export is entirely distinct from the previous view of the protein as a histone-binding factor involved with chromatin. Studies performed in vivo provide yet another perspective. The Berger group has shown that prothymosin α is phosphorylatedin vivo on glutamic acid residues in the region homologous with nucleoplasmin (33Trumbore M.W. Wang R.-H. Enkemann S.A. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26394-26404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These acyl phosphates are unstable in vivo and energy rich (33Trumbore M.W. Wang R.-H. Enkemann S.A. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26394-26404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 34Wang R.-H. Tao L. Trumbore M.W. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26405-26412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Upon cell lysis, most hydrolyze almost instantaneously, while a tiny fraction migrate to more stable positions on nearby serine or threonine residues (33Trumbore M.W. Wang R.-H. Enkemann S.A. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26394-26404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 35Barcia M.G. Castro J.M. Jullien C.D. Gonzalez C.G. Freire M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). By observing the changes in stability of prothymosin α's phosphates in vivo in cells overexpressing prothymosin α, in synchronized cells at different stages of the cell cycle, and in cells treated with metabolic inhibitors, the group concluded that prothymosin α's phosphates become stabilized and inactive during mitosis and in transcriptionally compromised cells (36Tao L. Wang R.-H. Enkemann S.A. Trumbore M.W. Berger S.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 178: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These experiments did not identify the prothymosin α-requiring process, but imply that prothymosin α's phosphates participate in some aspect of RNA biosynthesis. This idea is compatible with all of the binding partners noted above, but is also consistent with a catalytic function involving transfer of high energy phosphate. Yet another unrelated function has been proposed. Vega et al. (37Vega F.V. Vidal A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Domı́nguez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10147-10152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) assert that prothymosin α stimulates Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF-2) 1The abbreviations used are: eEF-2, eukaryotic elongation factor 2; GST, glutathione S-transferase.1The abbreviations used are: eEF-2, eukaryotic elongation factor 2; GST, glutathione S-transferase. in cellular extracts. eEF-2 catalyzes translocation of the ribosome along mRNA during translation. Phosphorylation, which renders eEF-2 inactive (38Ryazanov A.G. Shestakova E.A. Natapov P.G. Nature. 1988; 334: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), could play a role in the regulation of the rate of protein synthesis (reviewed in Refs. 39Ryazanov A.G. Spirin A.S. Ilan J. Translational Regulation of Gene Expression. 2. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1993: 433-455Google Scholar and 40Nairn A.C. Palfrey H.C. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1996: 295-318Google Scholar). Vega et al. surmise that prothymosin α exerts its effect on eEF-2 phosphorylation at mitosis when the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments are no longer distinct. Hence, they have implicated prothymosin α in the down-regulation of translation during M phase. We take issue with this proposal and with the observations on which it is based. Here, we show that prothymosin α has no effect on the ability of extracts to phosphorylate eEF-2. We found that Vega and co-workers studied the reaction under conditions of severe, nonspecific inhibition and that in our hands even in inhibited extracts, prothymosin α is ineffective. Finally, we studied the phosphorylation of eEF-2 by eEF-2 kinase with purified components in the presence and absence of prothymosin α and found no effect. Therefore, we conclude that prothymosin α has no role to play in the regulation of eEF-2 phosphorylation. NIH3T3 cells from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL 1658) were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum from Life Technologies, Inc., antibiotic-antimycotic, and 2 mmglutamine as described by Tao et al. (36Tao L. Wang R.-H. Enkemann S.A. Trumbore M.W. Berger S.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 178: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). COS 1 cells (ATCC, CRL 1650) were cultured in the same medium containing the same additives, but with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). The cells were transiently transfected with a prothymosin α gene containing six histidine codons inserted immediately upstream of the stop codon (33Trumbore M.W. Wang R.-H. Enkemann S.A. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26394-26404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) using the DEAE-dextran procedure (41Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. HeLa S-3 cells in liter quantities were a kind gift of Dr. Bernard Moss (NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). In some experiments, Escherichia colistrain BL21(DE3) transformed with pET3a containing the prothymosin α cDNA coding region similarly tagged with six histidine codons (33Trumbore M.W. Wang R.-H. Enkemann S.A. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26394-26404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was grown and induced to overexpress histidine-tagged prothymosin α using a kit and instructions provided by Stratagene. Native prothymosin α was isolated from HeLa cells as described by Trumbore et al. (33Trumbore M.W. Wang R.-H. Enkemann S.A. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26394-26404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), Wanget al. (34Wang R.-H. Tao L. Trumbore M.W. Berger S.L. J. Biol.

Purif. 1990; 1: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, washed cells were lysed in the presence of a detergent, nuclei were removed by centrifugation, and prothymosin α, which leaks out quantitatively, was recovered from the supernatant fluids by means of a phenol extraction. However, because such preparations contain RNA and other unknown contaminants as well as prothymosin α in the aqueous phase, the protein was further purified by ion exchange chromatography on a Bioscale Q2 column run with a Biologics (Bio-Rad) medium pressure chromatography system. The Q2 column replaced the TSK-gel DEAE-5PW column used in earlier studies (33Trumbore M.W. Wang R.-H. Enkemann S.A. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26394-26404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Samples were also subjected to reverse phase chromatography on a C-18 column to remove predominantly non-macromolecular contaminants (8Sburlati A.R. De La Rosa A. Batey D.W. Kurys G.L. Manrow R.E. Pannell L.K. Martin B.M. Sheeley D.M. Berger S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4587-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged prothymosin α from COS cells was isolated from lysates with the aid of metal chelate chromatography on nickel nitrilotriacetic resin (Qiagen) and purified further on the aforementioned Q2 column. Procedures and reagents that might inactivate or denature globular proteins such as heat, acid, phenol, or reverse phase chromatography were rigorously eschewed. Recombinant prothymosin α tagged with six histidine residues (tagged prothymosin α) was obtained using the methods detailed in the Stratagene instruction manual entitled pET System Vectors and Hosts. Further purification was effected with the Bioscale Q2 and C-18 columns noted above. The concentration of purified prothymosin α was determined from the absorbance at 214 nm and validated by amino acid analysis; in lysates, the amount in arbitrary units was obtained by densitometric scanning of bands in the identical stained gel (33Trumbore M.W. Wang R.-H. Enkemann S.A. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26394-26404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic EF-2 was purified from rabbit reticulocytes essentially as described by Ryazanov and Davydova (42Ryazanov A.G. Davydova E.K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). DNA coding for eEF-2 kinase was obtained from a cDNA library (CLONTECH) derived from human glioma cell line T98G, subcloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and expressed in Escherichia coli, BL21(DE3)pLysS. A portion of the resultant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-linked kinase was purified as an active enzyme from the soluble fraction, whereas the majority was recovered from inclusion bodies after denaturation in urea and renaturation by dialysis. Our methods were modifications of published procedures (43Marston F.A.O. Hartley D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The use of the GST-linked eEF-2 kinase made it possible to distinguish phosphorylation of eEF-2 from autophosphorylation of the kinase. Without the adduct, the kinase at ∼105 kDa and eEF-2 at ∼100 kDa would have comigrated during gel electrophoresis. Lysates for analysis of eEF-2 phosphorylation were prepared by four methods: detergent lysis; Dounce homogenization; sonication; and digitonin permeabilization. The preliminary steps performed in all cases were identical: NIH3T3 cells were trypsinized, suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, recovered by centrifugation, and washed once in phosphate-buffered saline. They were then resuspended in homogenization buffer (50 mmTris-HCl at pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, and protease inhibitors: 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and stored on ice at a concentration of 40 × 106/ml in preparation for lysis. Detergent lysis was carried out by making the homogenization buffer 1% in Triton X-100 and incubating the sample for 10 min on ice. Nuclei and debris were removed by brief centrifugation in a Tomy Tech USA refrigerated microcentrifuge at top speed (15,000 rpm) for 5 min, and the supernatant fluids were recovered and stored frozen. Cell lysates were prepared by Dounce homogenization by subjecting the cell suspension in homogenization buffer to 10 strokes of the tight pestle. Nuclei and debris were eliminated centrifugally as noted above, and the supernatant fluids were collected and stored frozen in aliquots. Cells were disrupted by sonication by treating them in homogenization buffer with a Sonic Dismembrator 550 (Fisher Scientific) equipped with a microtip probe at a power setting of 2 with a 1-s pulse and a 1-s delay between pulses. Sonication was continued on ice until froth formed in the sample, ∼15 s. Debris was removed by brief centrifugation. The supernatant fluids were collected and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min in a Sw55Ti rotor. The soluble material was dispersed into several tubes and frozen. The gentlest procedure was permeabilization in homogenization buffer containing 40 μg/ml digitonin. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the perforated cells and debris were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant fluids were recovered and stored frozen. In all cases, samples were desalted by two successive passes through G-50 spin columns that had previously been equilibrated with homogenization buffer without sucrose. In some cases, the lysates were freshly prepared, desalted, and used immediately without undergoing a freeze-thaw cycle. Reactions were performed in the presence and absence of fluoride. In the absence of fluoride, reactions were carried out in a volume of 25 μl in optimized buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH at pH 6.6, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm CaCl2) with 50 μm ATP, 0.04 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO; 4500 Ci/mmol) and lysate containing 10–20 μg of protein dispersed in a volume of 2–10 μl. The concentration of protein was determined with the aid of the Bio-Rad protein assay. Phosphorylation of purified eEF-2 by its purified kinase was accomplished in a volume of 25 or 50 μl with 1–1.5 μg of partially purified eEF-2, ≪1 μg of GST-EF-2 kinase, 0.5 μg of calmodulin, 50 μm ATP, and either 0.04 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP or 2 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products; 2000 Ci/mmol) in optimized buffer. Where indicated, fluoride was added to the optimized buffer. The effect of fluoride was also ascertained in an assay mix identical with that of Vega et al. (37Vega F.V. Vidal A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Domı́nguez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10147-10152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), namely 2–10 μl of cell extract containing 10–20 μg of protein, reaction buffer (40 mm HEPES at pH 7.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 50 mm NaF), and 5 μCi of [32P]ATP in a total of 25μl. Where noted, 8 μm prothymosin α was included. Reactions were carried out for 5 min at 30 or 37 °C for lysates and for the purified components as specified in the figure legends. Reactions were stopped by a combination of rapid cooling to 4 °C, dilution with 5× SDS electrophoresis sample buffer, and boiling for 5 min. Proteins were resolved electrophoretically in 8, 10, or 18% polyacrylamide SDS gels run in Tris-glycine buffer. The gels were either prepared in the laboratory or purchased from Novex, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. We used SeeBlue™ prestained standards from Novex according to the enclosed directions. After destaining, gels were dried and exposed to X-AR film (Eastman Kodak Corp.) in the presence or absence of intensifying screens. Cytoplasmic extracts from mammalian tissues, when incubated with [γ-32P]ATP incorporate radioactivity into proteins. In the presence of Ca2+, a band at ∼100 kDa, which can be identified as eEF-2, acquires label rapidly and dominates the electrophoretic pattern (39Ryazanov A.G. Spirin A.S. Ilan J. Translational Regulation of Gene Expression. 2. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1993: 433-455Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined the ability of sonicated lysates of NIH3T3 cells to phosphorylate a ∼100-kDa protein in a series of incubations extending from 1 to 20 min. When the products were resolved electrophoretically (Fig. 1), the expected band at ∼100 kDa appeared after the shortest incubation period, and gained a modicum of additional radioactivity with increased reaction times. Although the putative eEF-2 remained prominent throughout the study, by 20 min many other radioactive proteins had appeared. The literature states that prothymosin α stimulates the rapid phosphorylation of eEF-2 (37Vega F.V. Vidal A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Domı́nguez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10147-10152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In order to corroborate these findings, we tested two different kinds of prothymosin α; the first was native prothymosin α purified to homogeneity from HeLa cells, whereas the second was a recombinant human prothymosin α with six histidines affixed to the carboxyl terminus. The results (Fig. 1) were inconsistent with the published record (37Vega F.V. Vidal A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Domı́nguez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10147-10152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Neither type of prothymosin α stimulated the phosphorylation of the ∼100-kDa band. Indeed, the incorporation of radioactivity into any band, at any period of incubation, was not enhanced by the presence of prothymosin α. In these experiments, the Coomassie Blue-stained gels of all samples were identical regardless of the nature of the addition or the time of incubation (data not shown). Clearly under these conditions, prothymosin α appeared to be inert. Sonicated extracts of cells prepared with separate instruments differ. Therefore, in order to test widely differing lysates, we prepared cell extracts using four methods: detergent lysis, Dounce homogenization, sonication, and permeabilization with digitonin. From inspection of Coomassie Blue-stained gels (Fig.2 A), it is obvious that the compositions of the extracts vary and that each extract contains an array of prominent bands of similar size. It is not obvious that the entire cell complement of endogenous prothymosin α is also present in these lysates (Fig. 2 A, lanes labeled −). In order to obtain sufficient prothymosin α to be visible in a stained gel, it would have been necessary to load 1.5 mg of total protein, an amount ∼100-fold higher than that in Fig. 2 A. We have found that Triton lysis quantitatively releases the prothymosin α in a cell into the supernatant fluids (9Sburlati A.R. Manrow R.E. Berger S.L. Protein Exp. Purif. 1990; 1: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and that electrophoretic analysis followed by densitometry of the extracted materials from 5 × 106 NIH3T3 cells resulted in 710 arbitrary units of prothymosin α. Within an error of less than 5%, the identical amount of prothymosin α was recovered from sonicated and digitonin-permeabilized extracts, but lesser amounts were obtained from Dounce-homogenized cells owing to the failure of the method to rupture all of the cells. In contrast, the exogenous prothymosin α at 8 μm in the assay was easily viewed as an intense, stained band near the bottom of the 18% polyacrylamide gel (laneslabeled P), with the more slowly migrating histidine-tagged prothymosin α located immediately above it (lanes labeledT). The products of the phosphorylation reactions catalyzed by these lysates in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP are exhibited in Fig. 2 B. Here, it is apparent that the intensities of the ∼100-kDa bands of eEF-2 are a function of the composition of the lysate, but it is equally clear that neither prothymosin α from HeLa cells nor its histidine-tagged recombinant counterpart affect the reaction. The phosphorylation of eEF-2 remained independent of prothymosin α regardless of the quality or the quantity of cytoplasmic components in the lysate. Although there is no certainty that any of these extracts is identical to those of Vega et al. (37Vega F.V. Vidal A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Domı́nguez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10147-10152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), it is also unlikely that the reported stimulatory effect of prothymosin α was obliterated in all of them by the acquisition of inhibitors or the loss of cofactors during preparation. In a reconstituted system, it is possible to study the effect of prothymosin α on the phosphorylation of eEF-2 by its specific kinase in the absence of complicating factors. Differences in the levels of eEF-2, or kinase, or phosphatases in the lysates, as well as variations in the amount of nonradioactive ATP remaining after desalting all have the potential to influence the results. To avoid these p"
