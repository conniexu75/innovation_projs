This has been done until recently by laborious or complicated techniques4,5. I am indebted to Dr. G. Morpurgo, of the Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Rome, for informing me and permitting me to make use of his discovery that treatment with para-fluoro-phenylalanine of diploids of Aspergillus nidulans leads to wholesale segregation (this discovery was made known in the privately circulated Aspergillus News Letter, p. 10, No. 2, Spring 1961). In an extensive work expanding the formal genetical analysis—via mitotic segregation—of the fungus A. niger 6, I have applied this treatment to diploids of this asexual species."

The band due to tyrosine is of particu- lar interest since it is found to be displaced by 1 to 6 rnp toward longer wave lengths in solutions of native proteins relative to free tyrosine or its peptides. This has been clearly demon- strated in denaturation, acidification, or hydrolysis .of proteins’ when the tyrosine band is usually shifted back to the blue.2 The extent of the shift is most conveniently and accurately measured in the form of a difference spectrum (2-4). The reasons for the shift have been the subject of considerable interest in recent years, since they may have an important bearing on the internal configurations of proteins. Spectral studies on insulin (4-6) and ribonuclease (7-9) have led to the suggestion that tyrosyl -OH groups are involved as donors in hydrogen bonds to other protein side chains. However, difference spectra very similar to those from proteins have been obtained with 0-methyltyrosine and other simple model compounds (10) where there is no possi- bility of hydrogen bonding in the above sense. In view of these and other data, it has been suggested (11) that protein difference spectra may arise indirectly from general configurational changes which lead to changes in polarity and polarizability in the vicinity of the tyrosyl groups. It, therefore, seems appropriate at this time to summarize the various effects which have been shown to give rise to ultraviolet spectral changes (on chromophores, in general) and attempt to determine which of these effects may be important in proteins. 1. The absorption band in the 250 to 310 rnp region can be displaced and altered in intensity for several reasons which may be grouped together as non-ionic solvent effects: a. Nonpolar solvents may produce displacements relative to the spectrum of the solute in the vapor phase (12-15). Polar solvents produce additional effects due presumably to their orientation around the solute chromophore. This orientation may stabilize dipolar excited states (12-15) and produce a red shift which increases with the dipole moment of the solvent. For the same reason, the band displacement to the red may increase with the polarizability or refractive index of the solvent (13, 16-"

https://openalex.org/W2078211218,"IN man and in other mammals, bilirubin is excreted in conjugated form, mainly as the glucuronide. Since in mammalian fœtal liver the enzymatic mechanism for glucuronide formation is poorly developed, reaching its full capacity only after birth, transient hyperbilirubinæmia is frequently observed during the neonatal period1. In the amphibian genus, Rana, hepatic glucuronide formation is absent in the larva, but present in the adult2. The larval forms undergo extra-uterine development and hence are readily accessible. These Amphibia would represent an excellent experimental model for studying various aspects of neonatal hyperbilirubinæmia, if it could be established that they, like mammals, excrete bilirubin as glucuronide. Therefore, we have examined amphibian bile pigment excretion to determine, first, whether in the adult Rana bilirubin is excreted as a glucuronide; secondly, whether metamorphosis is associated with qualitative or quantitative changes in pigment excretion; and thirdly, whether the excreted pigment is biliverdin, as has been postulated previously3, bilirubin, or another pigment."

The nature of the animal's previous experience is thus one of the variables influencing behavioral responses to exogenous hormones."

https://openalex.org/W1970516903,"THE occurrence of the heptapeptide, L-methionyl-L-glutamyl-L-histidyl- L-phenylalanyl-L-arginyl-L-tryptophyl-glycine, in both adrenocorticotropins (ACTH) and melanotropins (MSH)1–3 has led to synthesis of various peptides4–7 related to all or part of this amino-acid sequence. In recent reports8 the synthesis of the glutamine analogue of this heptapeptide has been described, and it was shown to possess corticotropin-releasing (CRF) activity. In the course of the synthesis of a nonadecapeptide9 which has a sequence identical with the first 19 amino-acid residues of ACTH and which possesses ACTH and MSH activity, we have synthesized the heptapeptide in its natural form and found it to have both MSH and CRF activity."

https://openalex.org/W2029372929,This report concerns the origin and mechanism of fibrillation potentials. It is proposed that these potentials do not necessarily arise from degenerated endplate organs. The precursor is the rhythmic oscillations of the membrane potential. This mechanism may also occur in the case of epileptic discharges from epileptic cells in the cerebral cortex.

https://openalex.org/W2069500972,"The ocular lens of the 28- to 32-day-old rat contains an active hexose monophosphate shunt pathway for the combustion of glucose. Triphosphopyridine nucleotide (TPNH) cytochrome c reductase is present in this organ and is approximately one-third more active than diphosphopyridine nucleotide (DPNH) cytochrome c reductase. Since there is no transhydrogenase activity in these lenses, and since DPNH lactic dehydrogenase is 15 times as active as TPNH lactic dehydrogenase, the presence of an active TPNH cytochrome c reductase may provide this organ with the means of reoxidizing the relatively large amounts of TPNH formed by the direct oxidative pathway of glucose metabolism. Although TPNH oxidation in other tissues has not as yet been shown to yield adenosine triphosphate (ATP) directly, it is possible that such a mechanism may be operative in the rat lens."
