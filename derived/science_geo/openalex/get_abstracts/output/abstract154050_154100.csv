https://openalex.org/W2037372977,"Relatively young landforms on Mars, seen in high-resolution images acquired by the Mars Global Surveyor Mars Orbiter Camera since March 1999, suggest the presence of sources of liquid water at shallow depths beneath the martian surface. Found at middle and high martian latitudes (particularly in the southern hemisphere), gullies within the walls of a very small number of impact craters, south polar pits, and two of the larger martian valleys display geomorphic features that can be explained by processes associated with groundwater seepage and surface runoff. The relative youth of the landforms is indicated by the superposition of the gullies on otherwise geologically young surfaces and by the absence of superimposed landforms or cross-cutting features, including impact craters, small polygons, and eolian dunes. The limited size and geographic distribution of the features argue for constrained source reservoirs."
https://openalex.org/W2042764090,"With the escalation of obesity-related disease, there is great interest in defining the mechanisms that control appetite and body weight. We have identified a link between anabolic energy metabolism and appetite control. Both systemic and intracerebroventricular treatment of mice with fatty acid synthase (FAS) inhibitors (cerulenin and a synthetic compound C75) led to inhibition of feeding and dramatic weight loss. C75 inhibited expression of the prophagic signal neuropeptide Y in the hypothalamus and acted in a leptin-independent manner that appears to be mediated by malonyl-coenzyme A. Thus, FAS may represent an important link in feeding regulation and may be a potential therapeutic target."

Here, we show that mice lacking the orphan nuclear hormone receptor RORγ lose thymic expression of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-xL. RORγ thus regulates the survival of CD4 + 8 + thymocytes and may control the temporal window during which thymocytes can undergo positive selection. RORγ was also required for development of lymph nodes and Peyer's patches, but not splenic follicles. In its absence, there was loss of a population of CD3 – CD4 + CD45 + cells that normally express RORγ and that are likely early progenitors of lymphoid organs. Hence, RORγ has critical functions in T cell repertoire selection and lymphoid organogenesis."

This effect, rather than depending on ligand-induced receptor oligomerization, was found to stem from ligand- independent interaction of wild-type and mutant Fas receptors through a specific region in the extracellular domain. Preassociated Fas complexes were found in living cells by means of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between variants of green fluorescent protein. These results show that formation of preassociated receptor complexes is necessary for Fas signaling and dominant interference in human disease."

Microactuators based on polypyrrole-gold bilayers enable large movement of structures attached to these actuators and are of particular interest for the manipulation of biological objects, such as single cells. A fabrication method for creating individually addressable and controllable polypyrrole-gold microactuators was developed. With these individually controlled microactuators, a micrometer-size manipulator, or microrobotic arm, was fabricated. This microrobotic arm can pick up, lift, move, and place micrometer-size objects within an area of about 250 micrometers by 100 micrometers, making the microrobot an excellent tool for single-cell manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W2143364414,"We report the identification of a novel human cytokine, distantly related to interleukin (IL)-10, which we term IL-22. IL-22 is produced by activated T cells. IL-22 is a ligand for CRF2–4, a member of the class II cytokine receptor family. No high affinity ligand has yet been reported for this receptor, although it has been reported to serve as a second component in IL-10 signaling. A new member of the interferon receptor family, which we term IL-22R, functions as a second component together with CRF2–4 to enable IL-22 signaling. IL-22 does not bind the IL-10R. Cell lines were identified that respond to IL-22 by activation of STATs 1, 3, and 5, but were unresponsive to IL-10. In contrast to IL-10, IL-22 does not inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes in response to LPS nor does it impact IL-10 function on monocytes, but it has modest inhibitory effects on IL-4 production from Th2 T cells.

Additional members of this family also exist in human genomic sequence (1Adams, R. L., Farrah, T. M., Jelmberg, A. C., Lok, S., and Whitemore, T. E. (1999) Patent WO9907848-A1 and U. S. Patent 5,965,704.Google Scholar). 2M-H. Xie, S. Aggarwal, W-H. Ho, J. Foster, Z. Zhang, J. Stinson, W. I. Wook, A. D. Goddard and A. L. Gurney, unpublished observations. The known biological actions mediated by these molecules are diverse and include the antiviral actions of IFNα, IFNβ, and IFNγ, the immunomodulatory effects of IFNγ, a TH1 cytokine that potentiates inflammatory responses and promotes cell-mediated immune responses, the multiple and generally immunosuppressive actions of IL-10, and the role of tissue factor as a high affinity receptor for plasma factor VII/VIIa involved in cellular initiation of the coagulation cascade. The class II cytokine receptors are evolutionarily related and are characterized by the presence of a single transmembrane domain and an extracellular domain that contains several fibronectin-type three repeats. Given the great importance of members of the interferon receptor family, it is of interest to identify proteins that interact with this system as they are likely to perform significant immune functions. In this report we identify a new human cytokine, IL-22, that signals through a receptor complex that contains CRF2–4 and a new member of the class II cytokine receptor family. CRF2–4 has previously been demonstrated to be a functional component of the IL-10 signaling complex. This is the first example within the class II cytokine receptor family of a receptor being utilized as a component of multiple distinct cytokine signaling complexes. Antibodies used for STAT supershift experiments were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies for STAT tyrosine phosphorylation were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Antibodies for isolation of T cells were purchased from Pharmingen. Recombinant human IL-4, IFNγ, IL-10, and IL-12 was purchased from R&D Systems. Human TNF, IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, and IFNγ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were purchased from R&D Systems. A cDNA clone encoding IL-22 was identified in the Lifeseq EST data base (Incyte Pharmaceuticals) and sequenced in its entirety. Coding sequence for IL-22, IL-10, and the interferon family receptors were obtained by PCR amplification. Fc fusion proteins (immunoadhesins) were prepared by fusion of the entire open reading frames of IL-22 and IL-10 in-frame with the Fc region of human IgG1 in the eukaryotic expression vector pRK5tkNEO and the baculovirus vector pHIF, a derivative of pVL1393 purchased from Pharmingen. Fusion proteins were transiently expressed in human 293 cells or Sf9 insect cells and purified over a protein A column. IL-22 was also expressed as a C-terminal 8 × His tag fusion in baculovirus and purified by nickel affinity column. The identity of the purified protein was verified by N-terminal sequence analysis. IL-22 was also expressed with an N-terminal gD epitope tag as described (2Xie M.H. Holcomb I. Deuel B. Dowd P. Huang A. Vagts A. Foster J. Liang J. Brush J. Gu Q. Hillan K. Goddard A. Gurney A.L. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The sequences of the DNA constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. STAT activation and supershift assays using the SIE sequence and Western blot analysis of STAT tyrosine phosphorylation were performed as described previously (3Gurney A.L. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. de Sauvage F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5292-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and as recommended by antibody suppliers. Monocytes were enriched from fresh human blood by isolation of leukocytes using Lymphocyte Separation Medium purchased from ICN Biomedicals followed by enrichment of monocytes by adherence to tissue culture flask. Monocytes were then cultured for 24 h in 10% fetal bovine serum RPMI medium plus indicated cytokine treatment. For IL-22 mRNA expression experiments, resting T cells were isolated from leukocytes by negative selection with antibodies to CD14, CD19, CD56, CD11A, and HLA-DR purchased from Pharmingen. Isolated T cells were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum RPMI medium with anti-CD3 coated plates for 48 h with concanavalin A (2.5 μg/ml). To drive T cell differentiation to Th1 and Th2 T cells, CD4 positive cells were first isolated with anti-CD4 magnetic beads (Pharmingen). Cells were then cultured RPMI with an equal number (∼10 million) of irradiated monocytes in the presence of concanavalin A (2.5 μg/ml) and IL-2 (4 ng/ml) and either IL-12 (8 ng/ml) + anti IL-4 (0.5 μg/ml) or IL-4 (4 ng/ml) + anti-IFNγ (0.6 μg/ml) for Th1 or Th2, respectively. After 3 days, T cells were collected and washed twice and cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of IL-22-His (8 nm). As part of a larger effort to identify novel secreted proteins, we identified a novel human sequence that bears significant similarity to IL-10 (Fig. 1 A). This protein also strongly resembles a recently identified murine protein termed IL-TIFα, and is likely its human ortholog. Based on its similarity to the cytokine IL-10 and the data presented herein on the identification of its receptor as a member of an established cytokine receptor family and its production within leukocytes and action upon leukocytes, this molecule may appropriately be considered an interleukin. Following convention, we propose terming this molecule human IL-22. The isolated cDNA encodes a protein of 179 amino acids that is 23% similar to IL-10 and 78% identical to IL-TIFα (4Dumoutier L. Louahed J. Renauld J.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1814-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The first 33 amino acids are predicted to function as a signal sequence. N-terminal amino acid analysis of IL-22 expressed and purified using baculovirus confirm the mature sequence begins at amino acid residue 34. Northern expression analysis showed only trace level expression in several peripheral tissues (not shown). RT-PCR analysis showed that IL-22 mRNA is up-regulated in T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and further induced by exposure to concanavalin A (Fig. 1 B). To establish whether IL-22 was ligand for any of the members of the class II cytokine receptors, each receptor was tested for its ability to bind IL-22. Cells transiently expressing CRF2–4 showed strong binding of IL-22-fc fusion protein (immunoadhesion) (Fig.2 A). In contrast, IL-10-fc bound only to IL-10R. IL-22 also displayed low but detectable binding to a new member of the family of unknown function which we identified by searching sequences present in public sequence databases (1Adams, R. L., Farrah, T. M., Jelmberg, A. C., Lok, S., and Whitemore, T. E. (1999) Patent WO9907848-A1 and U. S. Patent 5,965,704.Google Scholar), which we term IL-22R (Fig. 2 B). IL-22R is a 574-amino acid protein most related to IL-10R and CRF2–4 (Fig. 2 C). To confirm the direct interaction of IL-22 with CRF2–4 and IL-22R, binding studies were conducted with epitope-tagged ligand and soluble receptor immunoadhesins. IL-22 bound to CRF2–4 but not to any of the other members of the interferon receptor family (Fig. 2 D). Direct binding was not observed by Western blot analysis with IL-22R, suggesting the interaction with this component may be of low affinity. Reasoning that IL-22 likely activated the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in a manner analogous to that observed with the interferons and members of the hematopoietic cytokine family, we surveyed a series of cell lines for activation of STAT transcription factors in response to IL-22. Two cell lines were observed to show rapid and robust STAT activation; TK-10, a renal cell carcinoma (Fig.3 A) and SW480, a colon adenocarcinoma (not shown). TK-10 did not induce STAT activity in response to IL-10. Interestingly, in this survey we observed another cell line, MOLT-4, a human lymphoblast cell line that did respond to IL-10 but did not respond to IL-22. The specific STAT proteins activated in response to IL-22 were examined using antibodies to the known STATs. In gel-shift assays, antibodies to STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 were able to supershift IL-22 induced binding complexes to an SIE sequence (Fig. 3 B) and other related STAT-binding elements (not shown). Furthermore, using antibodies specific for tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT, clear tyrosine phosphorylation of these STATs was observed in response to IL-22 (Fig. 3 C). As IL-22 and IL-10 signal STAT activation in distinct cell lines, we explored the expression pattern of IL-10R, CRF2–4, and IL-22R in these lines. RT-PCR analysis indicated CRF2–4 is expressed in both TK-10 and MOLT-4 (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, expression of IL-10R was detected in MOLT-4 and not in TK-10 and IL-22R expression was detected in TK-10 but not MOLT-4. These results suggested that functional signaling complexes for IL-10 included IL-10R and CRF2–4 as previously reported, and that IL-22 signaled through a complex that included CRF2–4 and IL-22R. To test this hypothesis, these receptors were transfected into COS cells and the ability of IL-10 and IL-22 to mediate STAT activation was determined (Fig.4 B). In agreement with previous reports IL-10 was able to mediate STAT activation in cells transfected with both CRF2–4 and IL-10R. Somewhat weaker activation was also seen in cells transfected with IL-10R alone. In contrast, IL-22 was able to mediate STAT activation in cells transfected with both CRF2–4 and IL-22R but not with either receptor transfected alone. Given the distant homology between IL-22 and IL-10, we examined whether IL-22 had similar biological activities to IL-10. Monocytes from freshly isolated human blood were examined for the ability of IL-22 to effect production of cytokines known to be regulated by IL-10. LPS induces a large increase in TNF production, an effect which may be substantially repressed by the presence of IL-10 (Fig.5). We observed that IL-22 had little if any effect on TNF production in the presence or absence of LPS. Furthermore, at 10-fold molar excess IL-10, it did not appear to inhibit the action of IL-10. Similar results were observed measuring production of IL-1 and IL-6 (not shown). The effect of IL-22 on production of cytokines by T cells was studied. Human T cells were polarized in vitro to either Th1 or Th2 differentiation by activation with concanavalin A in the presence of IL-12 and anti-IL-4 antibodies or IL-4 and anti-IFNγ antibodies, respectively. Cells were then washed and cultured in the presence or absence of IL-22 for 24 h. IL-22 treatment had little effect on IFNγ production from Th1 cells, but modestly inhibited production of IL-4 from Th2 cells (TableI).Table IIFNγ and IL-4 production by human T cellsIFNγIL-4Th1Th2Th1Th2−+−+−+−+pg/mlpg/mlExperiment 122507 ± 743422114 ± 114731225 ± 390833 ± 1046.5 ± 0.65.4 ± 0.785.2 ± 1.913.6 ± 2.7Experiment 211356 ± 18038844 ± 5471014 ± 91660 ± 22276 ± 1068 ± 22476 ± 39356 ± 48Experiment 37009 ± 5577714 ± 792247 ± 21138 ± 1027 ± 1.26.6 ± 0.729.6 ± 1.519.6 ± 2.5Experiment 410022 ± 21639241 ± 1232397 ± 39465 ± 19.45.5 ± 0.25.0 ± 0.351 ± 7.510.4 ± 0.7T cells were isolated from fresh human blood and polarized in vitro towards Th1 or Th2 differentiation for 3 days.

Shown are the results from four independent experiments. IL-22 signals through a receptor complex that includes CRF2–4 and a new member of the class II cytokine receptor family, IL-22R. Previous reports have demonstrated that CRF2–4 serves as a second component in IL-10 signaling (5Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Wu W. Pestka S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5894-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 6Spencer S.D. Di Marco F. Hooley J. Pitts-Meek S. Bauer M. Ryan A.M. Sordat B. Gibbs V.C. Aguet M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). CRF2–4 was initially discovered and identified as a member of the interferon receptor family on the basis of sequence similarity (7Lutfalla G. Gardiner K. Uze G. Genomics. 1993; 16: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Gibbs V.C. Pennica D. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 186: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The gene is located within a cluster that also includes IFN-αR1, IFN-αR2, and IFN-γR2 on human chromosome 21. A two-component receptor for IL-10 signaling parallels the IFNα/β and IFNγ systems which have each been shown to signal through two component receptors. The data presented here suggest that, in addition, CFR2–4 serves as a binding component of an IL-22 signaling complex. Thus CRF2–4 could serve in combination with IL-10R to transduce IL-10 signaling and also function within a signaling complex for IL-22 that likely includes the new member of this family, IL-22R. Overexpression of CRF2–4 alone or in combination with IL-10R does not appear to be sufficient to enable IL-22-dependent STAT activation, but combined with IL-22R does enable STAT activation. While shared receptor components have not been previously observed among the class II cytokine receptor family, within the large family of hematopoietic cytokine receptors such utilization of receptors in multiple distinct combinations to respond to different cytokines is common. Examples include the common β-chain utilized by IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF, the common γ-chain utilized by IL-2, -4, -7, –9, and -15, and gp130 utilized by multiple members of the IL-6 family of cytokines (reviewed in Refs. 9He Y.W. Malek T.R. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 503-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10de Groot R.P. Coffer P.J. Koenderman L. Cell.

J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). The LIF receptor serves both as a ligand binding subunit for LIF and CT-1 and also as a second component in signaling complexes for oncostatin M and ciliary neurotrophic factor (12Pennica D. Wood W.I. Chien K.R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,13Grotzinger J. Kurapkat G. Wollmer A. Kalai M. Rose-John S. Proteins. 1997; 27: 96-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In each of these cases the ligands, as in the case of IL-10 and IL-22, are evolutionarily related. Activation of STATs 1, 3, and 5 has also been reported for both IL-10 and murine IL-TIFα (4Dumoutier L. Louahed J. Renauld J.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1814-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 14Finbloom D.S. Winestock K.D. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1079-1090PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wehinger J. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Finke J. Mertelsmann R. Weber-Nordt R.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These same STATs have also been shown to be activated by a great number of hematopoietic cytokines, suggesting that other considerations such as the pattern of receptor expression influence the biological responses (reviewed in Ref.16Chatterjee-Kishore M. van den Akker F. Stark G.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 106-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Mice with targeted disruption of either CRF2–4 and IL-10 have been reported (6Spencer S.D. Di Marco F. Hooley J. Pitts-Meek S. Bauer M. Ryan A.M. Sordat B. Gibbs V.C. Aguet M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 17Kuhn R. Lohler J. Rennick D. Rajewsky K. Muller W. Cell. 1993; 75: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar, 18Rennick D.M. Fort M.M. Davidson N.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The phenotypes bear some similarity but also significant differences. Mice deficient in IL-10 developed chronic enterocolitis, were anemic, and were growth retarded when raised in a conventional environment. In comparison only 60% of the CRF2–4 mice raised under similar conditions had colitus but this was limited to the large intestine and did not involve the small intestine. The mice did not develop anemia and unlike the IL-10-deficient mice the CRF2–4 mice displayed a 4-fold increase in spleen to body weight with extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen of erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic lineages. These differences may be due in part to contributions of environment or genetic background, however, in light of the existence of a specific ligand for CRF2–4, the function of IL-10 in the CRF2–4-deficient mice should be re-evaluated. The broad distribution of CRF2–4 expression is reminiscent of the expression patterns seen for the receptors for IFNα/β and IFNγ whereas the expression of the IL-10R is restricted mainly to hematopoietic cells. Preliminary data suggests IL-22R is also restricted in its expression, but is detectable by RT-PCR in CD3 positive T cells and at low levels in several peripheral tissues (not shown). The broad expression of CRF2–4 may reflect the existence of additional ligands yet to be discovered which also share CRF2–4 as a common subunit. Interestingly, IL-10 and IL-22 appear to have somewhat mirror actions acting to promote Th2 or Th1 type responses, respectively. The ability of IL-22 to suppress IL-4 production may have therapeutic potential, particularly in the treatment of asthma.

The extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and transmembrane domains of the Arabidopsis receptor kinase BRI1, which is implicated in brassinosteroid signaling, were fused to the serine/threonine kinase domain of XA21, the rice disease resistance receptor. The chimeric receptor initiates plant defense responses in rice cells upon treatment with brassinosteroids. These results, which indicate that the extracellular domain of BRI1 perceives brassinosteroids, suggest a general signaling mechanism for the LRR receptor kinases of plants. This system should allow the discovery of ligands for the LRR kinases, the largest group of plant receptor kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1995633773,"The mouse heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene,<i>ho-1,</i> contains two inducible enhancers, E1 and E2. Of several cell lines tested, induction of an E1/luciferase fusion construct, pE1-luc, by CdCl<sub>2</sub> is most pronounced in MCF-7 cells. In these cells, E1, but not E2, is necessary and sufficient for <i>ho-1</i> gene activation. Exposure of MCF-7 cells to 10 μm CdCl<sub>2</sub> stimulates phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, implicating one or more of these signaling pathways in <i>ho-1</i>gene induction. SB203580, an inhibitor of p38, diminishes cadmium-stimulated pE1-luc expression and HO-1 mRNA levels by up to 70–80%. PD098059, an ERK pathway inhibitor, does not affect HO-1 mRNA induction at the highest concentration (40 μm) tested. Similarly, co-expression of a dominant-negative mutant of p38α, but not of ERK1, ERK2, JNK1, or JNK2, reduces basal and cadmium-induced pE1-luc activity. E1 contains binding sites for the activator protein-1 (Fos/Jun), Cap'n'Collar/basic leucine zipper (CNC-bZIP), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) families of transcription factors. A dominant-negative mutant of Nrf2 (a CNC-bZIP member), but not of c-Jun or C/EBPβ, inhibits pE1-luc activation by cadmium. Induction of the endogenous <i>ho-1</i>gene is also inhibited by the Nrf2 mutant. Mutations of E1 that inhibit cadmium inducibility also suppress the<i>trans-</i>activation and DNA binding activities of Nrf2, and SB203580, but not PD098059, attenuates Nrf2-mediated<i>trans-</i>activation of pE1-luc. Taken together, these results indicate that cadmium induces <i>ho-1</i> gene expression via sequential activation of the p38 kinase pathway and Nrf2."
https://openalex.org/W2072532644,"Definition of cellular responses to cytokines often involves cross-communication through their respective receptors. Here, signaling by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is shown to depend on the IFN-alpha/beta receptor components. Although these IFNs transmit signals through distinct receptor complexes, the IFN-alpha/beta receptor component, IFNAR1, facilitates efficient assembly of IFN-gamma-activated transcription factors. This cross talk is contingent on a constitutive subthreshold IFN-alpha/beta signaling and the association between the two nonligand-binding receptor components, IFNAR1 and IFNGR2, in the caveolar membrane domains. This aspect of signaling cross talk by IFNs may apply to other cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W1974883772,Many evolutionary studies use comparisons across species to detect evidence of natural selection and to examine the rate of character evolution. Statistical analyses in these studies are usually performed by means of a species phylogeny to accommodate the effects of shared evolutionary history. The phylogeny is usually treated as known without error; this assumption is problematic because inferred phylogenies are subject to both stochastic and systematic errors. We describe methods for accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty in evolutionary studies by means of Bayesian inference. The methods are computationally intensive but general enough to be applied in most comparative evolutionary studies.

Post-translational transit peptide cleavage sites for the maturation of the 13 cytosolically synthesized PRPs, and post-translational N-terminal processing in the maturation of the 12 plastid synthesized PRPs are described. Post-translational modifications in several PRPs were observed: α-N-acetylation of S9, N-terminal processings leading to five mature forms of S6 and two mature forms of S10, C-terminal and/or internal modifications in S1, S14, S18, and S19, leading to two distinct forms differing in mass and/or charge (the corresponding modifications are not observed in E. coli). The four PSRPs in spinach plastid 30 S ribosomal subunit (PSRP-1, 26.8 kDa, pI 6.2; PSRP-2, 21.7 kDa, pI 5.0; PSRP-3, 13.8 kDa, pI 4.9; PSRP-4, 5.2 kDa, pI 11.8) comprise 16% (67.6 kDa) of the total protein mass of the 30 S subunit (429.3 kDa). PSRP-1 and PSRP-3 show sequence similarities with hypothetical photosynthetic bacterial proteins, indicating their possible origins in photosynthetic bacteria. We propose the hypothesis that PSRPs form a “plastid translational regulatory module” on the 30 S ribosomal subunit structure for the possible mediation of nuclear factors on plastid translation.

The plastid translation system is thus a pivotal component of the plant biosystem. The largest functional entity of a translational system is the ribosome, composed of both RNA and 50–100 distinct proteins. The rRNAs in all categories of ribosomes have been fully identified, but complete characterization of ribosomal proteins has been achieved for only a few types of ribosomes (1Wittmann H.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 155-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 2Planta R.J. Mager W.H. Yeast. 1998; 14: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 3Wool I.G. Chan Y.-L. Glück A.

For example, only 30% of chloroplast mRNAs contain ribosome-binding sites even though a canonical anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence is present in all sequenced plastid 16 S rRNAs (7Sugiura M. Hirose T. Sugita M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 437-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Plastid mRNA is edited in most plants, and the mature mRNA levels remain relatively unchanged through dark/light transitions, whereas protein synthesis rates increase dramatically upon illumination (8Fromm H. Devic M. Fluhr R. Edelman M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 291-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Malonë P. Mayfield S.P. Rochaix J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Nuclear-encoded factors mediate light-regulated translation (10Yohn C.B. Choen A. Danon A. Mayfield S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as well as transcription and post-transcriptional processes in plastids (11Rochaix J.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 12Stern D.B. Higgs D.C. Yang J. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 308-315Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (446) Google Scholar), and many isolated nuclear mutants interfere with polysome assembly (13Barkan A. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 389-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, unlike in E. coli or cyanobacteria, the plastid translation system functions with additional regulatory elements under the control of the nuclear genome. It is possible that some of these controls are exerted through modifications in the plastid ribosome. Thus, a key to the understanding of plastid/chloroplast translation system could be a precise elucidation of its component parts and in particular those components that are unique.Two chloroplast-specific ribosomal proteins (PSRPs)1 in the 30 S ribosomal subunit with no obvious homology to any E. coliribosomal proteins have been previously identified (14Zhou D.X. Mache R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Johnson C.H. Kruft V. Subramanian A.R. J. Biol.

Since then, the complete list of ribosomal proteins in yeast and mammalian ribosomes (2Planta R.J. Mager W.H. Yeast. 1998; 14: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 3Wool I.G. Chan Y.-L. Glück A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 933-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and many mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (17Graack H.R. Wittmann-Liebold B. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 433-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) have been reported, but no homologues of the PSRPs exist in these ribosomes. The 30 S ribosomal subunit is responsible for the initiation of translation and therefore would be an appropriate site for regulatory intervention. Expecting to find additional PSRPs, we started a proteomic analysis of the plastid 30 S subunit, using two-dimensional PAGE, electroblotting/protein sequencing, HPLC separation, PCR-based screening/DNA sequencing, and mass spectrometry (LC/MS, ESI MS, and MALDI-TOF MS). A summary of the results from this study are presented below, including identification of all the proteins in the plastid 30 S subunit, post-translational modifications, and identification of two additional novel PSRPs. A corresponding study of the plastid 50 S subunit is presented in the accompanying paper (54Yamaguchi K Subramanian A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28466-28482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONAll the proteins in the cytosolic ribosomes of yeast (2Planta R.J. Mager W.H. Yeast. 1998; 14: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and mammals (3Wool I.G. Chan Y.-L. Glück A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 933-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) as well as the prokaryotic ribosome of E. coli(1Wittmann H.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 155-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) are presently identified from a combination of protein and DNA sequencing experiments. Similar endeavors have been in progress for the organelle ribosomes of yeast mitochondria (17Graack H.R. Wittmann-Liebold B. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 433-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and chloroplasts (reviewed in Refs. 4Subramanian A.R. Stahl D. Prombona A. Bogorad L. Vasil I.K. The Molecular Biology of Plastids. Academic Press, New York1990: 191-215Google Scholar, 5Harris E.H. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 700-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Subramanian A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 177-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this paper we present sufficient protein and nucleic acid data to establish the identification of all the proteins in the 30 S ribosomal subunit of a higher plant chloroplast/plastid ribosome.NomenclatureWe propose here a nomenclature for plastid ribosomal proteins and their genes that accords with the Commission on Plant Gene Nomenclature rules. Chloroplast ribosomal proteins are designated PRP (plastid ribosomal protein), in line with the designation of MRP for mitochondrial ribosomal protein. (The abbreviation CRP is avoided because “C” would suggest “cytosolic”; also, plastid is the general name for the organelle). Orthlogues of E. coli ribosomal proteins occurring in chloroplast will retain the E. coli designations, with the prefix PR added. Thus chloroplast/plastid orthlogues of E. coli S1–S21 and L1–L36 are to be designated PRPS1–PRPS21 and PRPL1–PRPL36, respectively. Chloroplast ribosomes contain proteins that do not have homologues in E. coli (eubacteria) or the cytosolic ribosomes of yeast and mammals. They (six in all: four in the 30 S subunit, and two in the 50 S subunit; Ref. 54Yamaguchi K Subramanian A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28466-28482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) are designated PSRP (plastid-specific ribosomal protein), PSRP-1–PSRP-4 in the 30 S subunit; the numbering based on pI and molecular mass. The PSRP nomenclature is recommend over the previous designations,e.g. S30/S22 for PSRP-1 and S31 for PSRP-4 (14Zhou D.X. Mache R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Johnson C.H. Kruft V. Subramanian A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12790-12795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Schmidt J. Srinivasa B. Weglöhner W. Subramanian A.R. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 29: 25-31PubMed Google Scholar), because S22/S30/S31 could be imagined to be homologues of cytosolic (or mitochondrial) ribosomal proteins with those names. The genes for plastid/chloroplast ribosomal proteins are distributed between the plastid's own genome and the nuclear genome, and therefore it is informative if the gene name reflects gene location. In accordance with the approved Commission on Plant Gene Nomenclature designation for plant genes (30Price C.A. Reardon E.M. Lonsdale D.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 225-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), gene names are written in italics, with nuclear genes having capital first letters, and organelle genes having lowercase first letters. Thus, the gene for nuclear encoded PRPS1 isPrpS1, whereas the gene for plastid encoded PRPS2 isprpS2, and gene for nuclear encoded PSRP-1 isPsrp-1 (note that all six PSRPs are encoded in the nucleus).Sufficient IdentificationThis work had its main focus on proteins, and therefore amino acid sequencing was carried out to the point of identification rather than completion. We kept in view the impending completion of several plant genome sequencing projects that are in progress, which would provide the complete (derived) RP sequences. However, the genome sequencing data cannot: (a) identify proteins that are specific to the chloroplast asribosomal proteins, (b) locate maturation cleavage sites in the precursors of imported PSRPs and PRPs that are encoded in the nucleus, (c) identify post-translational N-terminal processing of PRPs that are encoded in the organelle genome, (d) provide information on occurrence of post-translational modifications in individual RPs, and (e) give precise delineation of the exact number of RPs comprising a ribosome. In this work, even with incomplete protein sequence data, we were able to accomplish almost all the tasks listed above.Post-translational Processing: Chloroplast RPs Encoded in the Genome of the OrganelleIt can be concluded from our data that orthologues of all the 21 E. coli 30 S subunit RPs are maintained in the plastid/chloroplast ribosome. Twelve of these proteins are encoded by the plastid genome in spinach and other land plants and are synthesized on the plastid ribosome using formyl-Met-tRNA for initiation. Table IIIprovides information on post-translational N-terminal processing. Nine of the proteins have the initiating N-terminal formyl-Met residue excised, but in three (PRPs S15, S16, and S18) only the formyl group is removed, showing that post-translational N-terminal processing occurs via multiple pathways in the chloroplast. In E. coli, the excision of N-terminal Met by methionyl amino peptidase depends on the size of the side chain of the second amino acid; if it is bulky, the N-terminal Met was not removed (31Hirel P.H. Schmitter M.J. Dessen P. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The concerned side chains of PRPs S15, S16 and S18 are relatively bulky (Lys, Val, and Asp, respectively); it is therefore likely that plastid methionyl amino peptidase is related to the E. coli enzyme. The protein-chemically determined N-terminal sequences of all the 12 proteins matched 100% with the derived sequences from spinach plastid DNA, available in GenBankTM data base (accession numberAJ400848), except for a total of three amino acid differences in S15 and S18, which could arise from cultivar difference. We can therefore extend the earlier conclusion (32Schmidt J. Herfurth E. Subramanian A.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that the 30 S RP genes in the plastid DNA are all functional genes.Table IIIPost-translational modifications and processing in spinach chloroplast 30 S ribosomal proteinsPlastid encoded (12 proteins)PRP nameN-terminal sequencePost-translational modification/processing1 2 3 4 5 6 7S2Met-Thr-Arg-Arg-Tyr-Trp-Asn-fMet removedS3Met-Gly-Gln-Lys-Ile-Asn-Pro-1) fMet removed; 2) modified (153.5 Da added)3-aOnly mass spectrometric evidence.S4Met-Ser-Arg-Tyr-Arg-Gly-Pro-fMet removedS7Met-Ser-Arg-Arg-Gly-Thr-Val-fMet removedS8Met-Gly-Lys-Asp-Thr-Ile-Ala-1) fMet removed; 2) modified (75.9 Da added)3-aOnly mass spectrometric evidence.S11Met-Ala-Lys-Pro-Ile-Pro-Lys-fMet removedS12Met-Pro-Thr-Ile-Lys-Gln-Leu-1) fMet removed; 2) modified (151.8 Da added)3-aOnly mass spectrometric evidence.S14Met-Ala-Arg-Lys-Ser-Leu-Ile-1) fMet removed; 2) modified to produce two froms (96.5 Da added)3-aOnly mass spectrometric evidence.S15Met-Lys-Lys-Asn-Ser-Phe-Ile-1) Formyl group removed; 2) modified (76.5 Da added)3-aOnly mass spectrometric evidence.S16Met-Val-Lys-Leu-Arg-Leu-Lys-1) Formyl group removed; 2) modified (193.2 Da removed)3-aOnly mass spectrometric evidence.S18Met-Asp-Lys-Ser-Lys-Arg-Pro-1) Formyl group removed; 2) modified to produce two formsS19Met-Thr-Arg-Ser-Lys-Lys-Asn-1) fMet removed; 2) modified to produce two formsNuclear encoded (13 proteins)PRP nameTransit peptide cleavage sitePost-translational modification/processing during/after import into chloroplastC-terminal of transit peptideN-terminal of mature protein −10 −11 10S1—LKPRFSPIVS⇓AVAVSNAQTR—Processed to two forms differing in C-terminal and/or internal length/chargeS5—STRSFPTHLY⇓CIKKDDIDIT—Uncharacterized modification at N-terminal Cys (32.7 Da added)S6—YGPYVKAIAL⇓DFSGSFFEGG—Processed to five forms differing in N-terminal lengths (see Fig. 4)S9—AVVKPLVITA⇓TSATAPVEVA—Blocked by α-N-acetylation (+41.5 Da)S10—X⇓AAPGALEVLE—Processed to two forms differing in N-terminal lengths (see Fig. 4)S13—X⇓VRVGNVEIPN—S17—X⇓MRSMQGKVIC—S20—X⇓EVATLKKADS—S21—X⇓FRSAYNVQVL—PSRP-1—SRNKPNVVCM⇓SWDGPLSSVK—PSRP-2—TNPPLLKVRA⇓VVTEETSSSS—PSRP-3—LKKKNNWSLF⇓VAPETISDVA—Partially blocked (uncharacterized modification)PSRP-4—TSPALPLIYC⇓GRGDRKTAKG—Met removed, indicated by underlined text.

Open table in a new tab Post-translational Processing: Chloroplast 30 S RPs Encoded in the Nuclear GenomeA total of 13 chloroplast 30 S subunit RPs, including nine E. coli orthologues and four plastid-specific proteins, are encoded by the nuclear genome and are synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes as precursors that are considerably larger than the mature PRPs. The extra, routing, peptide sequence at the N terminus (transit peptide), directs the precursor molecule to the chloroplast envelope, where it is cleaved off upon entry into the organelle. This post-translational processing is performed by a stromal endopeptidase (33Richter S. Lamppa G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7463-7468Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), whose sequence specificity has not been fully delineated. TableIII lists the pre- and post-cleavage peptide sequences for eight PRPs and post-cleavage sequences for five PRPs. Because the N-terminal sequences of all nuclear encoded 30 S PRPs have been determined, their transit-peptide cleavage sites are now directly established.Post-translational Modifications in 30 S PRPsA significant difference between plastid RPs and E. coli RPs exists not only in protein composition but also in post-translational modification. Plastid specific post-translational modification is discussed below.PRPS1 exists in two forms (S1α and S1 β; Fig. 1) differing in charge and size. Their relative amounts were estimated from the yields of PTH amino acids from Edman degradation during sequence analysis (S1 α, 71%; S1 β, 29%). SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF MS analysis showed S1 α and S1 β to be 41 and 37 kDa proteins, respectively. Because the N-terminal sequences of the two forms were the same and because S1α mass corresponded to the mass derived from cDNA sequence (34Franzetti B. Carol P. Mache R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19075-19081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility of S1 β being the product of a shorter mRNA generated by alternative splicing (PrpS1 gene comprises 7 exons; Ref. 26Franzetti B. Zhou D.X. Mache R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 25: 4153-4157Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). If so, two cDNA species encoding the two forms of S1 should exist, and they could be amplified by PCR. A spinach cDNA library in λgt11 (25Giese K. Subramanian A.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3525-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was subjected to PCR amplification using an appropriate S1-specific forward primer (PS1F) and a reverse primer designed from the λ right arm. The experiment yielded only a single amplified species, whose DNA sequence corresponded to S1α (data not shown). Thus, S1β must be derived by post-translational modification from S1α, either post-translational C-terminal trimming or protein splicing of an intein.The mature form of PRPS5 has a significantly long N-terminal extension of 86 residues compared with E. coli S5 (Fig.7). Edman degradation of PRPS5 yielded an unidentified N-terminal PTH-derivative. Derived protein sequence of PRPS5 precursor from data base (accession number CAA63650) combined with the N-terminal sequence of the mature form (Table I) showed N-terminal cysteine. Pyridylethylation of PRPS5 with 4-vinyl pyridine under reducing conditions did not yield PTH pyridylethyl Cys, and therefore a modified cysteine is indicated. From MS data, the N-terminal Cys is likely to be modified with a 32.7-Da mass increment (Table II). Evidently, as Edman degradation was successfully performed to 32 cycles (Table I), the modification in PRPS5 does not block the N-terminal amino group. Therefore, it is a different modification from that in E. coli S5, where the protein is N-terminally acetylated, by RimJ gene product (35Yoshikawa A. Isono S. Shevack A. Isono K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 209: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).PRPS6 exists in five forms, and as briefly discussed under “Results” (Table I and Fig. 4), they differ only in their N-terminal portion. The relative amounts of the α to ε forms were, 8, 19, 10, 10, and 53%, respectively, as estimated from the yield of PTH-derivatives. In E. coli ribosome, S6 occurs in five forms, but the forms arise by a post-translational, C-terminal glutamylation reaction (36Hitz H. Schäfer D. Wittmann-Liebold B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 497-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). C-terminal poly-glutamylation in spinach chloroplast S6 could be ruled out from our LC/MS analysis of TP30 because we detected proteins with masses corresponding exactly to the PRPS6 forms of α, β, and ε (as calculated from the derived protein sequences; Fig. 4) and none with multiple increments of mass +129 Da (Glu residue). The forms γ and δ were not detected in the LC/MS experiment, probably because of the smaller amounts and/or less ionization. It has been suggested that the S6 glutamylating enzyme (gene, rimK) in E. coli recognizes the S6 C-terminal -Glu-Glu-COOH, because the modification is abolished in anrpsF mutant with -Lys-Glu-COOH at the C terminus (37Cumberlidge A.G. Isono K. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 25: 169-189Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Spinach chloroplast S6 has -Lys-Tyr-COOH at its C terminus, in a highly positively charged C-terminal context (5 of 10 residues basic), whereasE. coli S6 has -Glu-Glu-COOH in a highly negatively charged context. BLAST search of the data base did not reveal a plant gene matching the E. coli rimK gene. It is therefore likely that the C-terminal of PRPS6 is not polyglutamylated. Spinach PRPS6 also shows significant structural differences as compared with E. coli S6, e.g. a 39-residue-long NTE and a C-terminal truncation of 39 residues (Fig. 4). We suggest that it is likely the multiple forms of chloroplast S6 arise from five different proteolytic cleavage sites in the PRPS6 precursor. However, it is remarkable that, although using different post-translational pathways at the N- and C-terminal regions, both E. coli S6 and chloroplast S6 exist in five forms that carry similar overall net charge. Theoretical pI values, calculated from the sequences for the α to epsilon forms of chloroplast S6 are 4.59, 4.68, 4.78, 5.4, and 5.4, respectively, whereas the corresponding values E. coli S6 are 4.75, 4.83, 4.91, 5.02, and 5.17. Therefore, it appears that multiple forms of an acidic protein of pI 4.5–5.5 may be a requirement for a ribosomal biological function that is conserved in photosynthetic organelle evolution. In this context, the x-ray structure of Thermus thermophilus S6 shows the N- and C-terminal portions of the S6 protein are located side by side, forming a β sheet structure (38Lindahl M. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. Sedelnikova S.E. Eliseikina I.A. Fomenkova N.P. Nevskaya N. Nikonov S.V. Garber M.B. Muranova T.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1249-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).PRPS9 (spinach) is N-terminally modified, probably by α-N-acetylation, whereas E. coli S9 is a post-translationally unmodified protein. The alignment of bacterial and plant S9 proteins showed less similarity at the N-terminal portion; even among the higher plant S9s; but the C-terminal 30 amino acids are highly conserved, also between bacteria and higher plants. Indeed, chloroplast RPS9 was identified by an early experiment in our lab (39Bartsch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from its immunological cross-reaction to E. coli S9 antiserum.PRPS10 exists in two electrophoretically resolvable forms, differing in their N-terminal portion (Fig. 2 and Table I). Both forms were present in each of the two spots (Fig. 1, S10α and S10β) with the same relative amounts (estimated from PTH-derivative yields), 60% α and 40% β in either spot. As noted under “Results,” we obtained the complete mature PRPS10 sequence of ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum) chloroplast S10. The N-terminal portions of spinach and ice plant PRPS10 are well conserved, and therefore the post-translational modification sites in the two proteins could be readily identified (Fig. 4). The land plant S10 proteins are significantly longer than their homologues in E. coli,Synechocystis sp, and P. purpurea (marine alga) chloroplast and carry a negatively charged, 35-residue-long NTE.PRPS17 showed (Fig. 2, peak a) a minor form having the N-terminal sequence of the major form, but a smaller mass of 10,614 Da by ESI MS analysis. It could be a post-translationally modified (C-terminally truncated by 15 amino acids) form. The amount of the minor form was insufficient to show a distinct spot on the two-dimensional gel (Fig. 1).PRPS18 exists in two forms that are electrophoretically well separated (Fig. 1). E. coli S18 exists in a single, N-terminally acetylated (RimI gene; Ref. 35Yoshikawa A. Isono S. Shevack A. Isono K. Mol. Gen.

We have not identified the post-translational modification in chloroplast S18 (mass spectrometry did not provide data on S18β, Table II). The maize and rye (monocot plants) PRPS18s show a 7-fold repeat of a positively charged, hydrophobic heptapeptide motif (SKQPFRK) in their NTE, whereas only two such repeats are found in the PRPS18s of the dicot plants pea and tobacco (40Weglöhner W.

The recently published, 2.6 A resolution, crystal structure of a ribonucleoprotein complex from the central domain of T. thermophilus 30 S subunit (containing both S6 and S18) shows the three-dimensional arrangements of S6 and S18 proteins on a junction of 16 S rRNA helices 22 and 23 (43). The N-terminal region of S18 and both the N- and C-terminal regions of S6 are situated next to each other. These three terminal regions are at the edge of the 30 S subunit platform, where it is likely they play a role in translational regulation via their net positive (S18) and negative (S6) charges.Plastid-specific Ribosomal ProteinsThe most important finding from the study of chloroplast ribosomal proteins is likely to be the discovery and identification of PSRPs in this organelle ribosome.

These transcripts, termed virion RNAs, were packaged within infectious virions and were delivered to the host cell on infection. This mechanism of herpesvirus gene expression allows for viral genes to be expressed within an infected cell immediately after virus entry and in the absence of transcription from the viral genome."
https://openalex.org/W2140369420,"We determined placental tissue levels, production rates, and secretion rates of isoprostanes for placentas obtained from women with normal pregnancies and women with preeclampsia, a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. Isoprostanes are markers of oxidative stress that exert biological actions such as vasoconstriction. Placental tissue was rinsed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen to determine tissue levels of total and free isoprostane. Placental tissue pieces were also incubated in serum-free DMEM for 48 h at 37 degrees C in 95% air/5% CO(2) to determine production rates. Isolated placental cotyledons were perfused for the determination of secretion rates. All samples were analyzed by EIA for isoprostane using an antibody specific for 8-Iso-PGF(2) (15-F(2t)-IsoP). In addition, medium samples were analyzed for malondialdehyde (MDA), a breakdown product of lipid peroxidation. We found that tissue levels of free isoprostane and total isoprostane (free plus esterified forms) were significantly higher for preeclamptic placentas than for normal placentas. Concentrations of isoprostane and MDA in the medium increased progressively during 48 h of incubation of placental explants. At 48 h of incubation, the mean concentrations of both isoprostane and MDA were significantly higher for the placentas from preeclamptic women than for the placentas from normal pregnant women. Concentrations of MDA were highly correlated with those of isoprostane. Induction of oxidative stress with xanthine plus xanthine oxidase increased placental production of isoprostane by normal tissue to a level similar to that of preeclamptic tissue. Placental secretion of isoprostane was eightfold greater toward the maternal side of the placenta than toward the fetal side, and was increased sixfold on the maternal side and twofold on the fetal side by inducing oxidative stress with t-butyl hydroperoxide. This study presents new information that isoprostanes are formed and secreted by the human placenta and provides convincing evidence that oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation are abnormally increased in placentas of preeclamptic women."
https://openalex.org/W1967710441,"Diatoms are a key component of marine ecosystems and are extremely important for the biogeochemical cycling of silica and as contributors to global fixed carbon. However, the answers to fundamental questions such as what diatoms can sense in their environment, how they respond to external signals, and what factors control their life strategies are largely unknown. We generated transgenic diatom cells containing the calcium-sensitive photoprotein aequorin to determine whether changes in calcium homeostasis are used to respond to relevant environmental stimuli. Our results reveal sensing systems for detecting and responding to fluid motion (shear stress), osmotic stress, and iron, a key nutrient that controls diatom abundance in the ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2061370408,"H19 RNA is a major oncofetal 2.5-kilobase untranslated RNA of unknown function. The maternally expressedH19 gene is located 90 kilobase pairs downstream from the paternally expressed insulin-like growth factor II(IGF-II) gene on human chromosome 11 and mouse chromosome 7; and due to their reciprocal imprinting and identical spatiotemporal expression, it is assumed that the two genes are functionally coupled. Here we show that human H19 RNA contains four attachment sites for the oncofetal IGF-II mRNA-binding protein (IMP) with apparentKd values in the 0.4–1.3 nm range. The multiple attachment sites are clustered within a 700-nucleotide segment encoded by exons 4 and 5. This 3′-terminal segment targets H19 RNA to lamellipodia and perinuclear regions in dispersed fibroblasts where IMP is also localized. The results suggest that IMP participates in H19 RNA localization and provides a link between the IGF-II and H19genes at post-transcriptional events during mammalian development.

Despite intense efforts, the function of the gene product, H19 RNA, remains enigmatic (1Pachnis V. Belayew A. Tilghman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5523-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The H19 gene is transcribed by RNA polymerase II and encodes five exons and four unusually small introns (80–96 nucleotides in humans). The primary transcript is fully processed into a mature 2.5-kilobase polyadenylated RNA that is exported to the cytoplasm (2Brannan C.I. Dees E.C. Ingram R.S. Tilghman S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). The exons are considerably more conserved than the introns, and the mature H19 RNA does not exhibit any conserved open reading frames, arguing for a function of H19 as an untranslated RNA (3Hurst L.D. Smith N.G. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 134-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). H19 RNA is expressed during fetal development, predominantly in tissues of mesodermal and endodermal origin, and down-regulated at birth (4Poirier F. Chan C.T. Timmons P.M. Robertson E.J. Evans M.J. Rigby P.W. Development. 1991; 113: 1105-1114PubMed Google Scholar). It is also expressed in several tumors in tissues that normally express H19 RNA only during fetal development, thus exhibiting the characteristics of an oncofetal factor (5Ariel I. Ayesh S. Perlman E.J. Pizov G. Tanos V. Schneider T. Erdmann V.A. Podeh D. Komitowski D. Quasem A.S. de Groot N. Hochberg A. Mol. Pathol. 1997; 50: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The spatiotemporal distribution of H19 RNA is strikingly similar to that of IGF-II1 mRNAs, reflecting the physical linkage and reciprocal imprinting of the two genes (6Lee J.E. Pintar J. Efstratiadis A. Development. 1990; 110: 151-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The H19 gene, which is situated ∼90 kilobase pairs downstream from the IGF-II gene and transcribed in the same direction, is generally expressed from the maternal allele of human chromosome 11 and mouse chromosome 7 (7Bartolomei M.S. Zemel S. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 1991; 351: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar), whereas the IGF-II gene usually is expressed from the paternal allele (8DeChiara T.M. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1991; 64: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). In cells of endodermal lineage, the reciprocal imprinting of the two genes has been rationalized in terms of an enhancer competition model (9Bartolomei M.S. Webber A.L. Brunkow M.E. Tilghman S.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1663-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). However, strict enhancer competition is not sufficient (10Schmidt J.V. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9733-9738Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) since an intergenic differentially methylated domain in the H19 upstream region is crucial in achieving the proper monoallelic usage (11Thorvaldsen J.L. Duran K.L. Bartolomei M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3693-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Although the reciprocal imprinting of the H19 and IGF-II genes appears to be a general phenomenon, there are exceptions with monoallelic expression of one gene and biallelic expression of the other (12Adam G.I. Cui H. Miller S.J. Flam F. Ohlsson R. Development. 1996; 122: 839-847PubMed Google Scholar, 13Svensson K. Walsh C. Fundele R. Ohlsson R. Mech. Dev. 1995; 51: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Subcytoplasmic localization of RNAs is a conserved mechanism of polarizing genetic information in the establishment of asymmetries during oocyte and embryonic development and in somatic cells such as fibroblasts and neurons. The number of identified localized RNAs with different biological functions is approaching 100, including mRNAs, mitochondrial large ribosomal RNA, and other untranslated RNAs in metazoans such as Drosophila and Xenopus(reviewed in Ref. 14Bashirullah A. Cooperstock R.L. Lipshitz H.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 335-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Moreover, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is also able to localize mRNA (15Long R.M. Singer R.H. Meng X. Gonzalez I. Nasmyth K. Jansen R.P. Science. 1997; 277: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Localization mechanisms such as differential protection from degradation, local anchoring, and active directed transport have been described, and a common theme is that cis-acting elements target the RNA to its cytoplasmic destination. The phylogenetically conservedtrans-acting factors Vera/Vg1 RNA-binding protein (Vg1RBP) and Staufen contain multiple RNA-binding modules that recognize localization elements, implying that general molecular mechanisms mediate RNA transport (16Deshler J.O. Highett M.I. Abramson T. Schnapp B.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 17Havin L. Git A. Elisha Z. Oberman F. Yaniv K. Schwartz S.P.

The integrity of the cytoskeleton is crucial for both transport and anchoring, and the molecular interactions between the translocation complex and the cytoskeletal vehicles are emerging (reviewed in Refs. 14Bashirullah A. Cooperstock R.L. Lipshitz H.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 335-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar and 20King M.L. Zhou Y. Bubunenko M. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 546-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified and characterized a family of mammalian IGF-II mRNA-binding proteins (IMPs) that contains two RNA recognition motifs and four heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K homology domains (21Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Similar proteins have been proposed to mediate the subcytoplasmic localization of Vg1 and β-actin mRNAs inXenopus oocytes and chicken embryo fibroblasts, respectively (16Deshler J.O. Highett M.I. Abramson T. Schnapp B.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 17Havin L. Git A. Elisha Z. Oberman F. Yaniv K. Schwartz S.P. Standart N.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2158-2165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we show that four molecules of this family of RNA-binding proteins bind to the 3′-part of H19 RNA and that the latter is sufficient to direct subcytoplasmic localization of H19 RNA. We suggest that the H19 and IGF-II genes are linked mechanistically at the post-transcriptional level and that IMP participates in the subcytoplasmic localization of H19 RNA. The human H19 cDNA (2313 base pairs) was generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from human fetal liver total RNA (CLONTECH) using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The amplified fragment was inserted into the in vitro transcription vector pGEM-11f (Promega) and into the in vivo intronless expression vector pCB6+ (23Gashler A.L. Swaminathan S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4556-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). DNA fragments encoding H19 RNA segments C (positions 1–1613), E (positions 1612–2313), H (positions 1836–2008), J (positions 1923–2008), and K (positions 2006–2313) were generated by polymerase chain reaction using full-length H19 cDNA as the template for Pfu DNA polymerase, and the amplified fragments were inserted into pGEM-11f and pCB6+. RNA segments were generated byin vitro transcription of linearized DNA templates with T7 RNA polymerase and purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis or by gel filtration in Microspin S-300 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In UV cross-linking studies, a 10-μl random labeling reaction contained 100 μm unlabeled UTP and 3 μl of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), generating RNA with a specific activity of 30 Ci/mmol uridine monophosphate. In electrophoretic mobility shift analysis, the concentration of unlabeled UTP was lowered to 20 μm, thereby increasing the specific activity of uridine monophosphate in RNA to 150 Ci/mmol. Antisense H19 RNA probes for in situ hybridization, incorporating either digoxigenin-11-UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or ChromaTide Texas Red-5-UTP (Molecular Probes, Inc.), were generated by SP6 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and subsequently exposed to partial base hydrolysis. The final concentrations of digoxigenin-11-UTP/Texas Red-5-UTP and UTP during in vitrotranscription were 0.35 and 0.65 mm, respectively. In a final volume of 10 μl, 20–50 fmol of radiolabeled RNA (100 nCi) were incubated with 15 μg of total protein from a cytoplasmic extract of human HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells for 25 min at room temperature in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 140 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2% glycerol, and 0.1 μg/μl Escherichia coli tRNA. Samples were irradiated in a Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene) with UV light at 254 nm for 20 min in an ice-water bath, and RNA was digested by 1 μg of RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. In a final volume of 10 μl, 100–300 amol of radiolabeled RNA (2 nCi) were incubated with 0.1–2.0 nm recombinant IMP-1 or glutathioneS-transferase-tagged polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (GST-PTB) for 20 min at 30 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.004% bromphenol blue, and 0.1 μg/μl E. coli tRNA. Samples were chilled on ice, and 1 μl of 10% Ficoll-400 was added. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis was carried out on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 90 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 at 4 °C and 80 V for 6 h. The recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (21Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). H19 segment H was dephosphorylated by calf intestinal phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 5′-end labeling was carried out by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP using standard conditions. After each step, full-length transcripts were purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis. The end-labeled RNA was renatured and probed with ribonucleases T1, T2, and V1, and the G and A sequencing tracks were obtained by partial digestion with ribonucleases T1 and U2 as described previously (24Christiansen J. Kofod M. Nielsen F.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5709-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from mouse embryos by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNA was denatured in glyoxal/dimethyl sulfoxide, separated on a 1% agarose gel, transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes. Autoradiography was carried out from 16 to 48 h, and the hybridization signals were visualized with a Fuji BAS 2000 Bioimager. A mouse H19 cDNA probe for Northern analysis was generated by polymerase chain reaction and includes positions 103–979, whereas the IGF-II and IMP cDNAs were coding region probes. Human HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells and mouse NIH 3T3 embryo fibroblast cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum or in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. Stable transfectants of NIH 3T3 cells expressing GFP-IMP-1 were generated by retrovirus-mediated insertion of a construct encoding full-length IMP-1 fused to the C terminus of GFP. A cell pellet of ∼5 × 107 confluent HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.4), 140 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol) and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 ×g and 4 °C. The supernatant was made 5% in glycerol and stored at 80 °C in aliquots containing ∼5 μg of protein/μl. NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum. Cells were transiently transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) or Superfect reagent (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Briefly, 30,000 cells/cm2 were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated microscope slides 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with 2 μg/ml pCB6+H19, pCB6+H19ΔF, pCB6+H19ΔH, pCB6+E, or pCB6+C and left for 48 h before the medium was changed to Dulbecco's minimal essential medium without phenol red for 3 h. The cells were then fixed in 4% (w/v) formaldehyde, 5% (w/v) acetic acid, and 0.9% (w/v) NaCl at room temperature for 30 min. After de- and rehydration, the slides were incubated with 5 ng/μl digoxigenin- or Texas Red-labeled and base-hydrolyzed antisense H19 RNA probe in 50% formamide, 900 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 100 ng/ml salmon sperm DNA for 16 h at 42 °C and washed in 60% formamide, 300 mm NaCl, and 30 mm sodium citrate. The slides incubated with digoxigenin-labeled RNA were subsequently incubated with alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-digoxigenin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 90 min at room temperature and developed with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 5–10 min. In an initial attempt to identify proteins that associate with H19 RNA, a UV cross-linking strategy was adopted. Full-length H19 RNA and seven RNA segments (Fig.1) were randomly 32P-labeled and subjected to UV light at 254 nm in the presence of a cytoplasmic extract from human HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Fig.1 B shows the autoradiographs from the resulting SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of full-length H19 RNA and the three 5′-terminal RNA segments A–C (left panel) and the corresponding analysis of the four 3′-RNA segments E–H (right panel). Full-length H19 RNA exhibited three cross-links migrating at apparent masses of 50, 69, and 100 kDa. The 5′-terminal segments A–C cross-linked predominantly to the p100 species and did not cross-link to the p69 species. The four 3′-segments give rise to a cross-linking pattern similar to that of full-length H19 RNA, but with an additional signal at 60 kDa. The 50- and 100-kDa bands appear in cross-links with RNAs other than the H19 RNA segments, and the p50 species has tentatively been identified as the major core protein that associates unspecifically with RNA (26Evdokimova V.M. Kovrigina E.A. Nashchekin D.V. Davydova E.K. Hershey J.W. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3574-3581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). If 4-thiouridine was incorporated during in vitro transcriptions and UV irradiation was carried out at 365 nm, a similar band pattern was observed. 2S. Runge, F. C. Nielsen, J. Nielsen, J. Lykke-Andersen, U. M. Wewer, and J. Christiansen, unpublished data. Since a UV cross-linking profile can be sensitive to the magnesium ion concentration, cross-linking of segment F was examined at various concentrations of magnesium ions. Fig.2 A shows that the 60-kDa signal was predominant at concentrations at or below 1 mm, but was absent at 10 mm Mg2+. The presence of 0.5 μg of 23 S rRNA was unable to change the cross-linking pattern substantially (Fig. 2 B). We infer that H19 RNA cross-links to at least four protein species and that the 173-nucleotide segment H in the 3′-part exhibits a similar cross-linking profile. In a previous study of IGF-II mRNA-binding proteins, we showed that four proteins (p50, p60, p69, and p100) from an RD rhabdomyosarcoma lysate are able to cross-link to IGF-II leader 3 (21Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Moreover, we identified p60 as PTB and p69 as a member of the novel RNA-binding family termed IMP. Therefore, full-length H19 RNA and IGF-II leader 3 were cross-linked in parallel to a HepG2 cytoplasmic lysate and co-electrophoresed with H19 segment F cross-linked to the same lysate and also to recombinant IMP-1 and GST-PTB. The autoradiograph in Fig.3 A shows that full-length H19 RNA, IGF-II leader 3, and H19 segment F were cross-linked to comigrating protein species and that recombinant IMP-1 gave rise to a cross-link with segment F that comigrated with the p69 band from the lysate. Moreover, recombinant GST-PTB (86 kDa) could also be cross-linked to segment F. Since the small H19 segment H could account for the cross-linking profile of full-length H19 RNA (Fig. 1) and since a previous study established that 162 nucleotides of IGF-II leader 3 (termed segment C) binds with high affinity (Kd = 0.1 nm) to recombinant IMP-1 (21Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), 32P-labeled H19 segment H was subjected to a cross-linking experiment in the presence of unlabeled IGF-II segment C or unlabeled H19 segment H. The unlabeled competitor was added at final concentrations of 10 and 100 nm, corresponding to 2- and 20-fold molar excesses, respectively. Fig.3 B shows that the intensity of the p69 cross-linking signal was decreased, whereas the intensity of the p100 signal was increased in the presence of a 20-fold molar excess, regardless of the type of unlabeled competitor. The results show that H19 RNA and IGF-II leader 3 exhibit a virtually identical UV cross-linking pattern and suggest that the p69 and p60 cross-linking signals originate from IMP and PTB, respectively. To establish firmly that IMP and PTB are able to bind to H19 RNA, an electrophoretic mobility shift analysis was carried out with the 173-nucleotide segment H and recombinant IMP-1 and GST-PTB. Fig.4 shows autoradiographs from nondenaturing gel electrophoresis of 32P-labeled segment H with increasing concentrations of recombinant IMP-1 (panel A) and with increasing concentrations of recombinant GST-PTB (panel B). In the examined protein concentration range of 0.15–1.6 nm, segment H was able to bind one molecule of IMP-1 with an apparent Kd of 0.4 nm, whereas in the concentration range of 0.25–1.5 nm, GST-PTB exhibited one attachment site with an apparent Kd of 0.7 nm. At higher GST-PTB concentrations, an additional attachment site was revealed.2 We infer that segment H in H19 RNA behaves similarly to IGF-II leader 3 (21Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) by being able to bind recombinant IMP-1 and GST-PTB with high affinity. Since the 5′-terminal 1.6 kilobases of H19 RNA are unable to cross-link to p69 (Fig. 1) and since one molecule of IMP-1 binds to segment H in the 3′-part of H19 RNA, we examined whether additional IMP-binding sites are present in the 3′-end of H19 RNA. Mobility shift analyses of segments F–K were carried out at an IMP-1 concentration range of 0.25–1.75 nm, and Fig. 5 corroborates that segment H encompasses one IMP-binding site with an apparentKd of 0.4 nm. Furthermore, it reveals that segment G exhibits two binding sites with apparentKd values of 0.75 and 1.3 nm and that segment F, which includes both segments G and H, contains three binding sites with Kd values of 0.4, 0.75, and 1.3 nm. Segment K at the 3′ terminus contains one binding site with an apparent Kd of 1.0 nm. In an attempt to reduce further the size of the high affinity binding site in segment H, subsegments I and J were generated. Fig. 5 shows that none of the subsegments nor IGF-II leader 4 was able to bind IMP-1. We conclude that H19 RNA is able to bind four molecules of IMP-1. To gain insight into a putative RNA secondary structure of the high affinity attachment site, we subjected 5′-end-labeled segment H to probing with ribonucleases T1, T2, and V1 (24Christiansen J. Kofod M. Nielsen F.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5709-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Ribonuclease T1 monitors unpaired guanosines; ribonuclease T2 preferentially attacks unpaired adenosines; and ribonuclease V1 exhibits helical specificity. Fig.6 A is an autoradiograph showing the results of the enzymatic probing experiment, and Fig.6 B depicts the derived putative secondary structure. The striking feature of segment H is that besides two hairpins, it is unstructured in a classical Watson-Crick sense. The unstructured regions exhibit reactivities toward both single-stranded probes T1 and T2 and the helical probe V1. Cleavages by V1 suggest that these pyrimidine-rich regions exhibit base stacking in the naked RNA. Computer foldings of human and mouse H19 segment H by the program RNAdraw (27Matzura O. Wennborg A. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 247-249PubMed Google Scholar) generated secondary structures similar to the one depicted in Fig. 6 B.2 Similar to IGF-II and H19 RNAs, IMPs are mainly expressed in the placenta, fetal skeletal muscle, liver, and epithelia (21Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 4Poirier F. Chan C.T. Timmons P.M. Robertson E.J. Evans M.J. Rigby P.W. Development. 1991; 113: 1105-1114PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the temporal relation between the expression of H19 RNA and the family of IMP proteins, we subjected total RNA from mouse embryonic day 8.5 to birth to Northern analysis with H19, IMP-1, IMP-2, and IMP-3 cDNA probes (Fig.7). Whereas H19 RNA expression was at its peak at embryonic day 17.5, global IMP-1, IMP-2, and IMP-3 expression attained a maximum at embryonic day 12.5, followed by a decline toward birth (21Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), indicating that IMPs exhibit maximal activity during the initial phase of H19 expression. In the cytoplasm of transfected mouse NIH 3T3 embryo fibroblasts, IMP-1 is either evenly distributed or localized to the leading edge of the lamellipodia and perinuclear regions (21Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Since the in vitro binding data in Fig. 5 demonstrate that IMP-1 bound H19 RNA with high affinity, a possible role of endogenous IMP in the subcytoplasmic distribution of transfected H19 RNA in NIH 3T3 cells was examined by in situhybridization. The results show that the distribution of full-length H19 RNA is similar to that of IMP-1 (21Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) by being either evenly distributed in areas with confluent growth-arrested cells (88% of transfected cells) or, as illustrated in Fig.8 B, localized to the leading edge of lamellipodia and perinuclear regions in dispersed proliferating cells (42% of transfected cells). Untransfected cells in Fig.8 B show that no background reaction occurred with the employed in situ hybridization procedure. Excision of positions 1612–2005 from H19 RNA (H19ΔF RNA) removed three of the four IMP-1-binding sites, and the truncated RNA exhibited a diffuse cytoplasmic localization in both growth-arrested and proliferating NIH 3T3 cells (98% of transfected cells). Excision of the 173-nucleotide segment H (H19ΔH RNA), which encompasses the high affinity IMP-1-binding site (positions 1836–2008), reduced subcytoplasmic localization to 20% of the cells. Expression of H19 segment E (positions 1612–2313), which contains the entire complement of IMP-1- and PTB-binding sites in full-length H19 RNA, resulted in RNA accumulation at the leading edge of the lamellipodia and in perinuclear regions (69% of transfected cells) in a manner indistinguishable from full-length H19 RNA. Finally, H19 segment C (positions 1–1613), which lacks all IMP and PTB attachment sites, exhibited exclusive nuclear localization. Immunocytochemical staining of cells transfected with IMP-1 cDNA showed that IMP-1 localized to similar subcytoplasmic domains as H19 RNA, and transfection of stably transfected cells expressing GFP-tagged IMP-1 with full-length H19 cDNA revealed overlapping localization of GFP-IMP-1 and H19 RNA within the same cell in Fig. 8 C. We conclude that IMP-1 and H19 RNA localize to similar subcytoplasmic domains in NIH 3T3 cells and that segment E is sufficient to provide the complete localization response. In this study, we show that four molecules of an embryonic IGF-II mRNA-binding protein (IMP-1), containing two RNA recognition motifs and four heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K homology domains, associate specifically with the 3′-part of human H19 RNA. The subcytoplasmic localization of transfected H19 RNA reflects the localization of IMP-1 in lamellipodia and perinuclear regions of fibroblasts, and removal of three of the attachment sites leads to a de-localized distribution of the truncated RNA. The 3′-terminal 700 nucleotides of H19 RNA, which contain the full complement of the four attachment sites, are sufficient to mimic the localization pattern of full-length H19 RNA. The syntenic nature of the IGF-II and H19 genes, their similar spatiotemporal expression, and their reciprocal imprinting are characteristics that have led to the assumption that the two gene products are functionally coupled. Although the biological significance of the IGF-II peptide is well established (28DeChiara T.M. Efstratiadis A. Robertson E.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar, 29Eggenschwiler J. Ludwig T. Fisher P. Leighton P.A. Tilghman S.M. Efstratiadis A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3128-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), the lack of a clue to the biology of H19 RNA has hampered progress considerably. Here, we show that a family of embryonic RNA-binding proteins that were originally identified by the ability to bind to the IGF-II leader 3 mRNA also bind to H19 RNA, thus revealing a commontrans-acting factor that may be involved in a mechanistic coupling of the IGF-II and H19 genes at post-transcriptional events such as nuclear export, cytoplasmic localization, and translation. Strictly speaking, we show that only three molecules of IMP-1 are primary RNA-binding proteins since it is conceivable that the fourth molecule associates with segment G via protein-protein interactions. This study identifies PTB as an additional commontrans-acting factor that is able to associate with high affinity with the same RNA segments as the IMP family in both H19 RNA and IGF-II leader 3 (21Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the theme of twotrans-acting factors being able to associate with one RNA is also observed in the Xenopus Vg1 mRNA localization element where the two factors are Vg1RBP/Vera and VgRBP60 (30Cote C.A. Gautreau D. Denegre J.M. Kress T.L. Terry N.A. Mowry K.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 431-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), the former being the ortholog of human IMP-3 and the latter being homologous to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein I/PTB. Thein situ hybridization data with the de-localized H19ΔF RNA, which lacks three IMP attachment sites and two PTB-binding sites, suggest that a similar molecular mechanism of localization may occur in the mammalian system. Since PTB is predominantly a nuclear protein (31Ghetti A. Pinol-Roma S. Michael W.M. Morandi C. Dreyfuss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3671-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and since IMP is generally cytoplasmic, attachment of PTB to nascent RNA may provide a “nuclear experience” in the assembly of a translocation complex, so the proper conformation of the localization signal for subsequent IMP binding is achieved. Although various sequence elements have been suggested as the binding sites of the homologous Vg1RBP/Vera (16Deshler J.O. Highett M.I. Abramson T. Schnapp B.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 17Havin L. Git A. Elisha Z. Oberman F. Yaniv K. Schwartz S.P. Standart N. Yisraeli J.K.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2158-2165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), c-Myc coding region determinant-binding protein (32Doyle G.A. Betz N.A. Leeds P.F. Fleisig A.J. Prokipcak R.D. Ross J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5036-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and IMP (21Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) proteins, the recognition motifs are not known. Segment H in H19 RNA, which encompasses the high affinity binding site for recombinant IMP-1, was divided into two similarly sized subsegments I and J, neither of which was able to bind IMP-1 with high affinity. The most straightforward interpretation of this result is that the attachment site is severed. Alternatively, the two subsegments may contribute to a higher order RNA structure, or multiple RNA-protein interfaces may exist. To distinguish between the latter possibilities, segment H was subjected to the probing experiment with ribonucleases in Fig. 6, indicating the absence of a higher order interaction between subsegments I and J. Therefore, it is more likely that “unstructured” pyrimidine-rich elements in both subsegments may participate in the recognition event. The possibility of at least two RNA-protein interfaces in the recognition event is in agreement with the multiple RNA-binding domains of the IMP family (21Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) and provides a rationale for the lack of a simple sequence element in the RNA targets identified so far. The RNA targets are found in the 3′-untranslated region (Vg1 and β-actin mRNAs), in the translated region (c-Myc mRNA), and in the 5′-untranslated region (IGF-II leader 3 mRNA) in varying numbers, which may influence the fate of a particular mRNA differently. The binding data and the overlapping cytoplasmic localization pattern of H19 RNA and IMP-1 suggest that IMP-1 recognizescis-elements in H19 RNA and participates in its subcytoplasmic localization. This suggestion is supported by thein situ hybridization analyses of H19ΔF RNA, H19ΔH RNA, and segment E, which show that the presence of an intact segment E with its four IMP attachment sites at the 3′ terminus of H19 RNA is crucial for subcytoplasmic localization. The nuclear localization of segment C implies that the 300 nucleotides at the 3′ terminus of H19 RNA, which are present in H19ΔF RNA, contain a signal for nuclear export, but that this segment is insufficient for subcytoplasmic localization. Multiple and even redundant cis-acting signals in RNA localization have been described in a few cases (33Chartrand P. Meng X.H. Singer R.H. Long R.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 333-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 34Gautreau D. Cote C.A. Mowry K.L. Development. 1997; 124: 5013-5020PubMed Google Scholar, 35Gonzalez I. Buonomo S.B. Nasmyth K. von Ahsen U. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 337-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), but the lack of biophysical data regarding RNA-protein interactions and their stoichiometry makes general conclusions regarding the importance of multiple attachments of trans-acting proteins for efficient localization difficult. H19 RNA belongs to a group of localized untranslated RNAs with members such as the Drosophila polar granule component RNA (36Nakamura A. Amikura R. Mukai M. Kobayashi S. Lasko P.F. Science. 1996; 274: 2075-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), theXenopus and Drosophila Mtlr RNAs (37Kobayashi S. Amikura R. Mukai M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1117-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 38Kobayashi S. Amikura R. Okada M. Science. 1993; 260: 1521-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and the Xenopus Xlsirt RNAs (39Kloc M. Spohr G. Etkin L.D. Science. 1993; 262: 1712-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which play crucial roles during development. Among these, it is only Xlsirt RNAs that have been associated directly with post-transcriptional regulation of a messenger RNA. During Xenopus oogenesis, localization of the untranslated Xlsirt RNAs to the vegetal cortex of stage II/III oocytes is a prerequisite for the subsequent anchoring of the Vg1 mRNA at the vegetal cortex of stage III/IV oocytes (40Kloc M. Etkin L.D. Science. 1994; 265: 1101-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Since IMP-3 and Vg1RBP/Vera are orthologous proteins and since both IGF-II and Vg1 are secreted growth factors, a similar molecular mechanism of localization is appealing. However, the Xlsirt RNAs are localized by the early mitochondrial cloud-dependent pathway, whereas Vg1 mRNA is localized later in a microtubule-dependent manner (41Kloc M. Etkin L.D. Development. 1995; 121: 287-297PubMed Google Scholar), implying that Xlsirt RNAs do not bind Vg1RBP/Vera, which is in contrast to the binding between H19 RNA and the IMP family reported in this study. What is the function of H19 RNA? Since H19 RNA is expressed in a subset of instances of IGF-II production, whereas the opposite appears not to be the case, the most straightforward interpretation of the biological role of H19 RNA is one of a regulator of IGF-II expression. H19 knockout experiments (42Leighton P.A. Ingram R.S. Eggenschwiler J. Efstratiadis A. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 43Ripoche M.A. Kress C. Poirier F. Dandolo L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1596-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) suggest that H19 RNA is a negative regulator of IGF-II production since the resulting increase in neonatal weight is a hallmark of an increased IGF-II dosage (29Eggenschwiler J. Ludwig T. Fisher P. Leighton P.A. Tilghman S.M. Efstratiadis A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3128-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). However, the increased levels of IGF-II mRNAs due to the relaxation of genomic imprinting in the H19 knockout mice might obscure a regulatory function of H19 RNA at the post-transcriptional level. Suggestions that H19 RNA could have a function in cis, in analogy with the mechanism of action of Xist RNA in X chromosome inactivation (44Jaenisch R. Beard C. Lee J. Marahrens Y. Panning B. Novartis Found. Symp. 1998; 214: 200-209PubMed Google Scholar), have now been ruled out (45Jones B.K. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2200-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The evidence regarding a possible function of H19 RNA in trans is limited, although analysis of single cells in a Wilms' tumor suggests a functional interplay between H19 RNA and IGF-II mRNA (46Li Y.M.

Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 134-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and the identity of thetrans-acting factor presented in this study point to a riboregulator of importance in IGF-II production during mammalian development. We are grateful to Lena B. Johansson and Bente Rotbøl for technical assistance and Reidar Albrechtsen for help with the immunohistochemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1654229792,"Conservation relies increasingly on biological control (BC) of organisms that invade in natural and agricultural areas throughout the world. However, some BC organisms have harmed native species. In the United States, regulations are based on old laws meant to bar agricultural pests, and these are particularly ineffective in protecting native invertebrate animals. Improved ecological safety of BC depends on recognizing that BC is not appropriate for every pest, factoring ecological safety into the selection of BC agents, and limiting the importation and dissemination of agents that can harm either native animals or plants. Reasonable reform of BC will insure the viability of this valuable tool for both agriculture and conservation."
https://openalex.org/W1854281558,"Abstract Active absorption of calcium from the intestine and reabsorption of calcium from the kidney are major determinants of whole body calcium homeostasis. Two recently cloned proteins, CaT1 and ECaC, have been postulated to mediate apical calcium uptake by rat intestine and rabbit kidney, respectively. By screening a rat kidney cortex library with a CaT1 probe, we isolated a cDNA encoding a protein (CaT2) with 84.2 and 73.4% amino acid identities to ECaC and CaT1, respectively. Unlike ECaC, CaT2 is kidney-specific in the rat and was not detected in intestine, brain, adrenal gland, heart, skeletal muscle, liver, lung, spleen, thymus, and testis by Northern analysis or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The expression pattern of CaT2 in kidney was similar to that of calbindin D28K and the sodium calcium exchanger 1, NCX1, by in situ hybridization of adjacent sections. Furthermore, the mRNAs for CaT2 and calbindin D28K were colocalized in the same cells. CaT2 mediated saturable calcium uptake with a Michaelis constant (K m) of 0.66 mm when expressed inXenopus laevis oocytes. Under voltage clamp condition, CaT2 promoted inward currents in X. laevis oocytes upon external application of Ca2+. Sr2+ and Ba2+but not Mg2+ also evoked inward currents in CaT2-expressing oocytes. Similar to the alkaline earth metal ions, application of Cd2+ elicited inward current in CaT2-expressing oocytes with a K m of 1.3 mm. Cd2+, however, also potently inhibited CaT2-mediated Ca2+uptake with an IC50 of 5.4 μm. Ca2+ evoked currents were reduced at low pH and increased at high pH and were only slightly affected by the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel antagonists, nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem, and the agonist, Bay K 8644, even at relatively high concentrations. In conclusion, CaT2 may participate in calcium entry into the cells of the distal convoluted tubule and connecting segment of the nephron, where active reabsorption of calcium takes place via the transcellular route. The high sensitivity of CaT2 to Cd2+ also provides a potential explanation for Cd2+-induced hypercalciuria and resultant renal stone formation."

However, the precise identity of 4.1R isoforms in these subcellular structures, their binding partners, and their biological significance in nonerythroid cells are not well understood. The 80-kDa erythrocyte 4.1R protein is composed of four different domains as defined by chymotryptic digestion (19Leto T.L. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4603-4608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 30-kDa N-terminal domain (aa1207–474; GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number J03796) interacts with glycophorin C (20Marfatia S.M. Lue R. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2863-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The 30-kDa domain has also been shown to bind to CD44 (23Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Tokimitsu R. Krauss S.W. Kawashima M.

Blood. 1998; 92: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 10-kDa domain (aa 579–624) forms a ternary complex with spectrin and actin (25Correas I. Avila J. Biochem.

In nonerythroid cells, 4.1R interacts with calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner through its N-terminal extension (28Leclerc E. Vetter S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), with human CASK through its 30-kDa domain (29Cohen A.R. Wood D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walter Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) through its 22–24-kDa C-terminal domain. Like 4.1R, many members of the protein 4.1 superfamily, including ezrin, radixin, moesin, merlin, and myosin, are known to associate with the plasma membrane (reviewed in Ref. 31Tsukita S. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). A Drosophilahomolog of protein 4.1, Coracle, is localized at septate junctions in ectodermally derived epithelial cells (32Fehon R.G. Dawson I.A. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Development. 1994; 120: 545-557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DrosophilaNeurexin and DLG (Discs Large), homologs of proteins that are known to bind to 4.1, glycophorin C, and human DLG, respectively, are also localized at the septate junctions (33Baumgartner S. Littleton J.T. Broadie K. Bhat M.A. Harbeck R. Lengyel J.A. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Prokop A. Bellen H.J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies suggest the localization of 4.1 to the septate junction, an invertebrate specific junction with molecular components analogous to the vertebrate tight junction (TJ) (35Willott E. Balda M.S. Fanning A.S. Jameson B. Van Itallie C. Anderson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In addition to membrane binding activity, members of this family participate in important cell signaling events. For example, merlin is involved in growth regulation (36Lajeunesse D.R. McCartney B.M. Fehon R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and ezrin, radixin, and moesin are involved in Rho-dependent signaling pathways (37Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To explore the function of 4.1R isoform(s) in nonerythroid cells, we searched for their binding partners. In this study, using a combination of molecular/genetic, biochemical, and immunofluorescence studies, we establish that two nonerythroid 4.1R isoforms bind to the C-terminal proline-rich domain of X-104, a human homolog of the canine protein ZO-2 (henceforth referred to as hZO-2), through its C-terminal domain. ZO-2 belongs to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family of proteins and is known to organize the TJ in association with other TJ-associated proteins (39Beatch M. Jesaitis L.A.

We report here that these isoforms of 4.1R colocalize with ZO-2 and occludin and also form an intracellular complex with ZO-2, ZO-1, occludin, actin, and α-spectrin at MDCK cell TJs. Our results suggest that in nonerythroid cells, 4.1R may have a role in the organization and function of the TJ by establishing a direct link between the TJ and the actin cytoskeleton. Construction of full-length 4.1R (135-kDa/pAS2-1); 80-kDa 4.1R (80-kDa/pAS2-1); its 30-kDa (30-kDa/pAS2-1), 16-kDa (16-kDa/pAS2-1), 10-kDa (10-kDa/pAS2-1), and 22–24-kDa (22–24-kDa/pAS2-1) domains; or its N-terminal extension (HP; HP/pAS2-1) (see Fig. 1 A and GenBankTMaccession number J03796) in frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in the yeast two-hybrid vectors pAS2-1 and pGBT9 have been described (13Mattagajasingh S.N.

Full-length hZO-2, ZO-2, ZO-1, occludin, or their segments were subcloned in frame with the Gal4 transactivation domain in the yeast two-hybrid vector pACT2 by PCR amplification of the desired nucleotide sequences using the ExpandTM Long Template PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), a GeneAmpTM PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and custom oligonucleotide primers (Life Technologies, Inc.) by standard molecular biology methods (42Sambrook J.

Full-length human occludin (aa 1–504, FL-hOc/pACT2; GenBankTM accession number U49185) and its N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (aa 1–57, N-hOc/pACT2) and C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (aa 250–504, C-hOc/pACT2) were amplified from phOc6 (45Ando-Akatsuka Y.

Construction of deletion constructs representing different exons of the 22–24-kDa domain of 4.1R, such as exons 17–21/pGBT9, exons 18–21/pGBT9, exons 18–20/pGBT9, exon 19/pGBT9, exon 20/pGBT9, exon 21/pGBT9, exons 20–21/pGBT9, exon 21-(762–775)/pGBT9, exon 21-(745–761)/pAS2-1, and exons 19/21/pGBT9, has been described (13Mattagajasingh S.N. Huang S.-C. Hartenstein J.S. Snyder M. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The construct exons 19–21/pGBT9 was derived from 22–24-kDa/pAS2-1 using custom oligonucleotide primers 2093–2112 and 2354–2374 (GenBankTM accession number J03796) as described above; it was cloned into the SalI and PstI sites of pGBT9. Deletion constructs of hZO-2 representing amino acids 980–1118 (hZO-2Δ980–1118/pACT2), 980–1073 (hZO-2Δ980–1073/pACT2), 980–1028 (hZO-2Δ980–1028/pACT2), 1113–1168 (hZO-2Δ1113–1168/pACT2), 1072–1118 (hZO-2Δ1072–1118/pACT2), and 1054–1118 (hZO-2Δ1054–1118/pACT2) were derived from FL-hZO-2/pACT2. Constructs used for expression of 4.1R/glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins (135-kDa/GST, 80-kDa/GST, HP/GST, 30-kDa/GST, 16-kDa/GST, 10-kDa/GST, and 24-kDa/GST) have been described (13Mattagajasingh S.N. Huang S.-C. Hartenstein J.S. Snyder M. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For in vitro transcription and translation, cDNA sequences corresponding to aa 2863–3325 (ZO-2-1/TOPO) and 3089–3653 (ZO-2-2/TOPO) of hZO-2 (GenBankTM accession number L27476), aa 4354–5588 (ZO-1-1/TOPO) and 5587–6467 (ZO-1-2/TOPO) of hZO-1 (GenBankTM accession number L14837), and aa 461–919 (Ocl-1/TOPO) and 923–1687 (Ocl-2/TOPO) of human occludin (GenBankTM accession number U49185) were amplified with the addition of the Kozak consensus sequence and the translation initiation site (GCCACCATG) incorporated at the 5′-end and a stop codon at the 3′-end. The amplified products were cloned into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To express 4.1R/green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusion proteins, the desired 4.1R cDNA sequences were amplified by PCR and cloned in frame into the SalI and SmaI sites of the pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-C2 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). HP→10-kDa/GFP, 10-kDa/GFP, and 22–24-kDa/GFP were amplified from 135-kDa/pAS2-1, 10-kDa/pAS2-1, and 24-kDa/pAS2-1, respectively. 10+24-kDa/GFP was generated by two-step PCR as described (13Mattagajasingh S.N. Huang S.-C. Hartenstein J.S. Snyder M. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) using primer sets 2026–2040 and 2294–2393 for amplification of 10-kDa/pAS2-1 and primer sets 2307–2336 and 2795–2816 (46Baklouti F. Huang S.-C. Vulliamy T.J. Delaunay J. Benz Jr., E.J. Genomics. 1997; 39: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) for amplification of 22–24-kDa/pAS2-1. 10-kDa/GFP and 10+24-kDa/GFP contained the alternatively spliced exons 14–16. Accuracy of the reading frame and the authenticity of all deletions were confirmed by manual dideoxy sequencing. The Gal4-based MATCHMAKER Two-hybrid System II (CLONTECH) was followed for the yeast two-hybrid assays as described earlier (13Mattagajasingh S.N. Huang S.-C. Hartenstein J.S. Snyder M. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Plasmid vectors pAS2-1 or pGBT9 and pACT2, encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4-BD) and Gal4-activating domain (Gal4-AD), respectively, were used to express hybrid proteins . Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y190 was transformed with full-length 4.1R (135-kDa/pAS2-1) or its 22–24- and 10-kDa domains (22–24-kDa/pAS2-1 and 10-kDa/pAS2-1, respectively). Transformants were analyzed for expression of the bait protein by Western blotting. To screen for proteins that interact with 4.1R in yeast two-hybrid assays, a human brain cDNA library in Gal4-AD vector pACT2 was screened by sequential transformation of Y190 expressing full-length 4.1R (135 kDa) or its 10- or 22–24-kDa domain as a Gal4-BD fusion protein (see “Construction of Expression Vectors” for details). Transformants were selected in synthetic medium lacking Trp, His, and Leu containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole. DNA was isolated from positive clones, and the Gal4-AD plasmids were recovered in Escherichia colistrain HB101 and further tested for specificity by cotransformation into Y190 with 135-kDa/pAS2-1, 10-kDa/pAS2-1, or 22–24 kDa/pAS2-1 or with pAS2-1 alone. The Gal4-AD plasmids recovered from positive clones were sequenced as described above. For domain mapping, plasmids carrying inserts fused to Gal4-BD or Gal4-AD were cotransformed into Y190 and assayed for β-galactosidase activity on nitrocellulose filters. In some cases, liquid β-galactosidase assays using o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside or chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside were used as described in theCLONTECH manual. MDCK cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL 1772) were used in this study because they are known to express TJ proteins and to form TJs at confluent density (47Hoi Sang U. Saier Jr., M.H. Ellisman M.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1979; 122: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have described the culture conditions for MDCK cells and have documented the expression of 4.1R in this cell line at both the protein and RNA levels (13Mattagajasingh S.N. Huang S.-C. Hartenstein J.S. Snyder M. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips in a six-well tissue culture plate 1 day prior to transfection. Cells at 50–70% confluency were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA. After 36–48 h, cells on coverslips were removed, fixed, and processed for immunofluorescence staining with anti-ZO-1 Ab as described below. Antibodies to synthetic peptides of segments of the 4.1R 22–24-kDa domain (GVLLTAQTITSETPSSTTTTKITKC, exon 19; anti-24-kDa Ab), 16-kDa domain (TQAQTRQASALIDRPAPHFERC, exon 12; anti-16-kDa Ab), and 10-kDa domain (MESVPEPRPSEWDK, exon 17; anti-10-kDa Ab) and to the recombinant (GST-fused) N-terminal extension of 4.1R (anti-HP Ab) have been characterized (2Tang T.K. Qin Z. Lato T. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Mattagajasingh S.N. Huang S.-C. Hartenstein J.S. Snyder M. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Anti-ZO-2 Ab, anti-ZO-1 Ab, and anti-occludin Ab were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Anti-actin monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. Anti-p53 Ab was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). Rabbit IgG was purchased from Pierce. Anti-spectrin (α and β) Ab was a kind gift from Dr. Robert J. Bloch (University of Maryland, Baltimore). Immunoprecipitation of 4.1R, ZO-1, ZO-2, and occludin was performed using MDCK cell extracts. About 4 × 106 cells were collected by scraping with a rubber policeman, washed three times with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2% CHAPS, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml antipain, 12.5 μg/ml chymostatin, 12 μg/ml pepstatin, 130 μg/ml ε-aminocaproic acid, 200 μg/ml p-aminobenzamidine, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5), and given 20 strokes in a tight-fitting glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C; the supernatant was collected; and the protein content was determined using a protein determination kit (Bio-Rad). Rabbit preimmune serum equivalent to 50 μg of IgG was added to 2 mg of proteins and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 200 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in immunoprecipitation buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and split equally into seven tubes. Preimmune serum, affinity-purified anti-HP Ab, anti-ZO-1 Ab, anti-ZO-2 Ab, anti-occludin Ab, rabbit IgG, or anti-p53 Ab (an irrelevant antibody as a control) containing 6 μg of IgG was added to different tubes and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (100 μl of a 50% suspension) was then added and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rocking platform. Following incubation with protein A-Sepharose, the samples were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 s at 4 °C and washed 10 times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer. The samples were resuspended in 80 μl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 μg/ml bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) and boiled in a water bath for 5 min. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were fractionated on 6–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and detection of 4.1R, ZO-1, ZO-2, occludin, actin, and spectrin were carried out by immunoblotting using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described earlier (13Mattagajasingh S.N. Huang S.-C. Hartenstein J.S. Snyder M. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Quantitation of proteins from chemiluminograms was done with NIH Image software for the Apple Macintosh computer. To visualize proteins, the gels were stained with GelCode® SilverSNAPTM from Pierce. Recombinant 4.1R/GST proteins were expressed and affinity-purified by coupling to glutathione-Sepharose beads as described (13Mattagajasingh S.N. Huang S.-C. Hartenstein J.S. Snyder M. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were quantitated by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Desired [35S]methionine-labeled segments of hZO-2, hZO-1, and human occludin were in vitro translated using a TNT® SP6 Quick Coupled transcription/translation system (reticulocyte lysate system; Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The translation products were quantitated based on percent of methionine incorporation and35S-specific activity. For in vitro binding, equal amounts of labeled proteins were incubated with 20 μg of 4.1R/GST fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C in 300 μl of binding buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml antipain, 12.5 μg/ml chymostatin, 12 μg/ml pepstatin, 130 μg/ml ε-aminocaproic acid, 200 μg/ml p-aminobenzamidine, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After incubation, the beads were washed 10 times with 1 ml of binding buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 each time. The beads were then resuspended in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% gel; National Diagnostics, Inc., Atlanta). The gels were treated with EnlightningTM (NEN Life Sciences Products), and binding of 35S-labeled proteins was detected by fluorography. To determine the dissociation constants between 4.1R and ZO-2, ZO-1, or occludin, 5 μg of 24-kDa/GST or GST (as a control) coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with 0.0025–0.015 μg of35S-labeled translated products as described above. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 20 mm glutathione, pH 8.0. The amount of bound and free labeled protein was determined from35S-specific activity and adjusted for binding to the GST-conjugated Sepharose beads. A Scatchard plot of the data was generated.

The coverslips were washed three times with PBS and fixed in freshly prepared 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 25 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized with a solution of 0.2% Triton X-100 and 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 15 min. The cells were blocked with 10% normal goat serum and 50 mmNH4Cl for 1.5 h at room temperature and washed three times with PBS containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin.

In this report, we demonstrate MIS type II receptor expression in normal breast tissue and in human breast cancer cell lines, breast fibroadenoma, and ductal adenocarcinomas. MIS inhibited the growth of both estrogen receptor (ER)-positive T47D and ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines, suggesting a broader range of target tissues for MIS action. Inhibition of growth was manifested by an increase in the fraction of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and induction of apoptosis. Treatment of breast cancer cells with MIS activated the NFκB pathway and selectively up-regulated the immediate early gene IEX-1S, which, when overexpressed, inhibited breast cancer cell growth. Dominant negative IκBα expression ablated both MIS-mediated induction of IEX-1S and inhibition of growth, indicating that activation of the NFκB signaling pathway was required for these processes. These results identify the NFκB-mediated signaling pathway and a target gene for MIS action and suggest a putative role for the MIS ligand and its downstream interactors in the treatment of ER-positive as well as negative breast cancers.

Müllerian inhibiting substance transforming growth factor-β cytomegalovirus human growth hormone chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) bone morphogenetic protein tumor necrosis factor-α MIS,1 a member of the TGF-β family of hormones, causes regression of the epithelial-mesenchymal unit of the Müllerian duct in the embryonic male urogenital ridge. In females the Müllerian duct autonomously differentiates into the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and upper vagina (1Teixeira J. Donahoe P.K. J. Androl. 1996; 17: 336-341PubMed Google Scholar). The Müllerian ducts of both male and female embryos are responsive to MIS only during a critical period in development after which they lose sensitivity (1Teixeira J. Donahoe P.K. J.

However, MIS is produced at high levels by Sertoli cells of the testis even after the regression of the Müllerian duct, decreases at adolescence, and is produced throughout adult life. In females, it is synthesized by postnatal granulosa cells of the ovary and can be detected in the female serum until menopause (3Hudson P.L. Dougas I. Donahoe P.K. Cate R.L. Epstein J. Pepinsky R.B.

The developmental significance of the MIS type II receptor was demonstrated in MIS type II receptor null male mice, which develop normally but have a persistent Müllerian duct that forms a uterus and oviducts; this phenotype resembles that of MIS ligand-deficient mice (9Behringer R.R.

MIS is a negative regulatory factor in fetal rat lung maturation, where it inhibits the production of pulmonary surfactant both in vitro andin vivo (12Catlin E.A. Manganaro T.F. Donahoe P.K. Am. J.

Biol. 1989; 25: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The importance of the signaling pathways initiated by members of the TGF-β superfamily in the control of breast cell proliferation is also demonstrated by the presence of genetic mutations or loss of expression of activin/TGF-β receptors in human breast cancers (29Di Loreto C. Reis F.M. Cataldi P. Zuiani C. Luisi S. Beltrami C.A. Petraglia F. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 141: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 37Chen T. Carter D. Garrigue-Antar L. Reiss M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4805-4810PubMed Google Scholar). However, MIS type II receptor expression and the effects of MIS-mediated signaling on growth and differentiation of the breast have not been investigated. Recent studies have shown that TGF-β-mediated inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation is associated with a decrease in NFκB DNA binding activity (38Sovak M.A. Arsura M. Zanieski G. Kavanagh K.T. Sonenshein G.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 537-544PubMed Google Scholar). The signaling cascade associated with activation of the NFκB pathway, initially described in association with inflammatory responses in the cellular immune system, is also induced by stress, growth arrest, and apoptosis in a wide variety of cell types (39Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R94-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). The NFκB family consists of transcriptional activators, including p65, p50, p52, and c-Rel, which share a Rel homology domain. These molecules form either homo- or heterodimers and bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner. NFκB in its inactive state exists in the cytosol bound to the inhibitory IκB family of molecules. Activation of the pathway by extracellular signals leads to phosphorylation and degradation of IκB with subsequent nuclear localization of NFκB (39Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R94-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). IEX-1 is an NFκB-inducible immediate early gene that is induced by radiation, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, Fas, and TNF-α (41Kondratyev A.D. Chung K.N. Jung M.O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1498-1502PubMed Google Scholar). Wu et al. recently demonstrated the existence of two IEX-1 splice variants, IEX-1S and IEX-1L. IEX-1L has an in-frame insertion of 37 amino acids resulting from the presence of the entire intronic sequence within the coding region of the IEX-1S transcript (42Wu M.X. Ao Z. Prasad K.V. Wu R. Schlossman S.F. Science. 1998; 281: 998-1001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of functional binding sites for NFκB and p53 in the IEX-1 promoter supports its role in regulation of growth, differentiation, and stress response (43Schafer H. Diebel J. Arlt A. Trauzold A. Schmidt W.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate MIS type II receptor expression in normal breast and in human breast cancer cell lines, breast fibroadenomas, and tumors. MIS inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells through activation of the NFκB signaling cascade, which is developmentally regulated in breast epithelial cells (44Clarkson R.W.E. Heeley J.L.

Thus, breast tissue might be an additional target for the action of the ovarian hormone MIS. Human breast cancer cell lines T47D, MCF7, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-231 and COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% female fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. ZR 75-1 was grown in RPMI 1640 containing the same supplements. COS cells were transfected using Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described in the manufacturer's guide to determine protein expression. To measure inhibition of cell proliferation, monolayers of equal numbers of T47D cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate DNA precipitation technique with vector or CMV-driven expression constructs (see figure legends) along with 0.5 μg of a construct that encodes hygromycin resistance. Cells were selected in medium containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 3–4 weeks, colonies were stained with crystal violet and counted. To test the growth inhibitory effect of exogenous rhMIS, cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes at 3 × 104 cells/plate in the absence of MIS. MIS was added after 24 h, cultures were grown in the presence or absence of 35 nm MIS for 4 days, and cells were counted on the Coulter counter. To analyze the effect of MIS on cell cycle progression, cells were grown to 20% confluence and treated with 35 nm (5 μg/ml) MIS for 4 days. Cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA, fixed in 95% ethanol, stained for DNA content with propidium iodide, and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Caspase-3 activity was determined as described in theCLONTECH ApoAlert Caspase-3 Assay kits user manual. Briefly, T47D cells were treated with 35 nm rhMIS for 3 days and equal amounts of protein lysate were analyzed for caspase-3 activity. Caspase-3 levels in the cell were calculated based on a standard curve, and relative fold induction was estimated. T47D cells were grown to 70% confluence and treated with indicated concentrations of rhMIS for specified lengths of time. Cells were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 1 ml of TKM 10:10:1 (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgCl2), and lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm at 4 °C, and proteins were extracted in buffer containing 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, 350 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. 3 μg of protein was used in 25-μl binding reactions containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 70 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 4% glycerol. NFκB oligonucleotides (Promega) were32P-end-labeled, and DNA protein complexes were resolved on 4% native polyacrylamide gels. Supershift experiments were performed by adding 0.1 μg of rabbit anti-p65 or -p50 antibodies (Santa Cruz) to the binding reactions. The 2X-NFκB-CAT reporter construct was a kind gift from Dr. R. Bravo (Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute). For CAT assays, T47D cells were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate DNA precipitation technique with 5 μg of 2X-NFκB-CAT and 1 μg of human growth hormone (hGH) encoding plasmid. Untreated cells and cells treated with 35 nm MIS for 12 h were harvested, lysed, and analyzed by CAT-ELISA according to the protocol provided by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Transfection efficiency was standardized using hGH-ELISA as described in the manual provided by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. RNase protection assays were done using a 302-base pair antisense probe containing exon 11 (228 base pairs) and the 3′-untranslated region (74 base pairs) of the human MIS type II receptor cDNA. This receptor fragment contained within PvuII-XhoI restriction sites was cloned in reverse orientation intoXhoI-EcoRV sites of pCDNA 3.1(−) plasmid. The resulting construct was sequenced to confirm the boundaries of the insert and was linearized with HindIII, and the antisense transcript was obtained using T7 polymerase (MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit, Ambion). RNase protection assays were done with 75 μg of total RNA isolated from T47D, MDA-MB-231, ZR 75-1, and COS-7 cells using the RPA III ribonuclease protection assay kit (Ambion). Briefly, RNA was hybridized with 375,000 cpm of radiolabeled probe overnight at 55 °C and digested with a mixture of RNase A and RNase T1 for 30 min at 37 °C. The protected fragments were precipitated and analyzed on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide, 8m urea sequencing gel. 75 μg of yeast tRNA were used as positive control for the function of RNase, and another sample containing the same amount of yeast tRNA was incubated without RNase to control for probe integrity. Sequencing reactions of the plasmid containing the antisense MIS type II receptor probe was electrophoresed on the same gel to estimate the sizes of the fragments. RNA was isolated from cells using RNA STAT-60 total mRNA isolation kit (Tel-Test, Inc). Poly(A)+ RNA from T47D, MDA-MB-231, MCF7, and MDA-MB-468 was obtained using the FastTrack 2.0 mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen) and poly(A)+ RNA from the adult human testis was purchased from CLONTECH. 4 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was separated on a formaldehyde gel, transferred to HyBond membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and probed with human MIS type II receptor cDNA. 7.5 μg of total RNA isolated from either T47D or MDA-MB-231 cells was analyzed by Northern blot with radiolabeled IEX-1 or actin. IEX-1 probe for Northern analysis was derived by PCR amplification of T47D cDNA using the following primers: sense, 5′-TCCAGAGGACGCCCCTAACG-3′; and antisense, 5′-GTTCACAGAACATACTAGGC-3′. Primers for detecting the presence of IEX-1L and IEX-1S transcripts by PCR were: sense, 5′-TCCGGTCCTGAGATCTTCAC-3′; and antisense, 5′-CTCTTCAGCCATCAGGATCT-3′. cDNA derived from total RNA isolated from untreated and MIS-treated T47D and MDA-MB-231 cells, and 50 ng of DNA from CMV-driven IEX-1S and IEX-1L expression constructs were amplified with the primers above at an annealing temperature of 50 °C for 30 cycles. Primers for detecting MIS type II receptor expression in normal human breast, breast carcinomas, and cell lines were: sense, 5′-GCT GGC TTA TGC TCT TCT CCT TC-3′; and antisense, 5′-ACC TCG CAC TCT GTA GTT CTT TCG-3′. Total RNA isolated from tissue derived from normal human breast, two invasive ductal carcinomas, and a fibroadenoma of the breast (Tumor Bank, Massachusetts General Hospital) was converted to cDNA and amplified with the above primers by PCR. The MIS type II receptor in normal rat breast cDNA was amplified using the following primers: sense, 5′-CAGCCCTGGCTTATCCTCAGG; and antisense, 5′-GCCACACGCATGTCAGCCTGT-3′ (which generates a 220-base pair fragment); sense, 5′-GTGTGTTCTTTGAGGCTCCTGGAGTT-3′; and antisense, 5′-CTCAGCAGCAGCACAAGGAACACT-3′ (which produces a 410-base pair fragment). The rabbit MIS type II receptor antibody was generated by injecting animals with the peptide C-G-T-D-F-C-N-A-N-Y-S-H-L-P-P-S-G, which corresponds to amino acids 111–127. The antibody was purified over a protein A-Sepharose column before use. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Proteins were harvested in RIPA buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mmNaC1, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane, and blocked in Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 136 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 0.1% Tween) containing 30% milk. The type II receptor antibody was used at a dilution of 1:3000 in 10% milk/Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 solution. Blots were incubated with the primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature, washed, and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS cells transfected with 3 μg of FLAG-tagged rat MIS type II receptor construct using 9 μl of FUGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and expression was detected by Western blotting using antibodies to the type II receptor or FLAG. Expression of the MIS type II receptor mRNA in human breast cancer cell lines was analyzed by RNase protection assay and Northern blot analysis. RNase protection assay was performed with a 302-base pair radiolabeled antisense riboprobe containing part of exon 11 and the 3′-untranslated sequence of the human MIS type II receptor. The MIS type II receptor mRNA was present in the breast cancer cell lines T47D, MDA-MB-231, and ZR 75-1 (Fig. 1 A,left panel). The protected fragment was approximately 93 base pairs shorter than the full-length probe due to the presence of unrelated vector sequence at both the 5′ and 3′ ends. COS-7, the SV-40 transformed kidney cell line derived from the African green monkey, did not express the MIS type II receptor mRNA (Fig.1 A, right panel). Yeast tRNA samples were hybridized with the probe and incubated with or without RNase to control for RNase activity and probe integrity, respectively. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from T47D, MCF 7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cell lines also demonstrated that the 2-kilobase MIS type II receptor mRNA was present in a pattern similar to that observed with poly(A)+RNA derived from adult human testis (Fig. 1 B). The presence of two transcripts is consistent with Northern analyses of RNA isolated from rat and mouse Leydig cell tumor lines (18Teixeira J. Fynn-Thompson E. Payne A.H. Donahoe P.K. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4732-4738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and human ovarian cancer cell lines, which express the MIS type II receptor (17Masiakos P.T. MacLaughlin D.T. Maheswaran S. Teixeira J. Fuller Jr., A.F. Shah P.C. Kehas D.J. Kenneally M.K. Dombkowski D.M. Ha T.U. Preffer F.I. Donahoe P.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 3488-3499PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of MIS type II receptor in breast cancer cell lines T47D and MDA-MB-231 was also confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR amplification and sequence analyses using primers specific for exons 1 and 5 (data not shown). The expression of the MIS type II receptor protein in breast cancer cell lines was demonstrated by Western blot analysis. COS cells transfected with a CMV-driven FLAG-tagged rat MIS type II receptor construct were analyzed by Western blot to characterize the rabbit MIS type II receptor antibody. The MIS type II receptor protein migrated with a molecular mass of approximately 63 kDa, as detected by the MIS type II receptor antibody, and was absent in cells transfected with vector (Fig. 1 C, left panel). Re-analysis of the membrane with an anti-FLAG antibody displayed a protein of the same molecular weight in cells transfected with the receptor (Fig. 1 C, right panel). Immunoblot of total cellular protein isolated from human breast cancer cell lines T47D, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 using the rabbit MIS type II receptor antiserum demonstrated the presence of the 63-kDa endogenous receptor protein. This protein was absent upon preincubation of the antibody with an excess of the cognate peptide. Antibody specificity was also confirmed by analyzing the blots with preimmune rabbit serum (Fig. 1 D). We also detected expression of the MIS type II receptor mRNA in normal breast and in a breast fibroadenoma and two invasive ductal carcinomas using PCR amplification of cDNA generated from these tissues (Fig. 1 E, upper panel). Primers specific for exons 1 and 5 demonstrated the presence of a DNA fragment of the expected size (582), the DNA sequence of which was identical to that of exons 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the human MIS type II receptor (data not shown). MIS type II receptor in normal rat breast was detected by PCR analyses using primers that span exons 2 and 4 (Fig. 1 E, lower panel) and exon 11 and the 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 1 E, lower panel) of the rat MIS type II receptor. Sequence of the DNA fragments amplified by these primers was identical to the rat MIS type II receptor (data not shown). We could not detect expression of the MIS ligand in culture supernatants obtained from either normal or cancer cell lines of the human breast by MIS-ELISA. Furthermore, PCR of cDNA derived from normal and tumor tissue obtained from human breast cancer patients did not amplify the MIS ligand. These observations suggests that, although breast epithelial cells are responsive to serum MIS, they do not produce detectable levels of the MIS ligand. To study the functional properties of MIS type II receptor expression in breast tissue, we determined whether MIS alters the growth properties of the ER-positive breast cancer cell line T47D. We cotransfected T47D cells with a plasmid encoding hygromycin resistance and either CMV-vector (V), CMV-driven cleavable bioactive MIS (K2), or noncleavable inactive MIS (K6) (23Kurian M.S. de la Cuesta R.S. Waneck G.L. MacLaughlin D.T. Manganaro T.F. Donahoe P.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 343-349PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of wild type and mutant MIS in the medium was 15–20 ng/ml by MIS-ELISA. Expression of MIS in T47D cells resulted in 75% reduction of drug-resistant colonies compared with vector-transfected cells. The noncleavable inactive form of MIS did not affect the growth of T47D cells (Fig. 2 A). Addition of exogenous rhMIS (recombinant human MIS) to proliferating cells also inhibited growth (Figs. 2 B and3 E). In order to determine whether MIS-mediated inhibition of T47D cell growth involved changes in cell cycle distribution, cells were treated with 35 nm (5 μg/ml) rhMIS, fixed in 95% ethanol, stained for DNA content with propidium iodide, and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Treatment with rhMIS lead to a consistent 10–16% increase in the G1"

Many functionally distinct serpins have been identified in higher eukaryotes, some in viruses, but none in yeast or bacteria (4Marshall C.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 30: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have been studied. Despite the high concentration of these inhibitors in the grains of monocot cereals (up to 4% total protein), the physiological functions of plant serpins remain unknown. Increasing numbers of putative serpin genes and serpin mRNAs have been identified from other monocot plants, including rice and wild oats, from eudicot plants, including tomato, cotton, and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and from the non-vascular plant Physcomitrella patens (EMBL/GenBank), suggesting that serpins are widespread in the plant kingdom.Inhibitory serpins are metastable proteins (>40 kDa) employing a unique “suicide substrate” mechanism of irreversible inhibition very different from the reversible “standard mechanism” used by other proteinase inhibitors (<25 kDa) (1Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landers Company, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). The serpin in its native, active conformation has a flexible reactive center loop (RCL) located near the C terminus and protruding from the main body of the protein as a bait. The proteinase recognizes a specific peptide bond (P1-P1′) in the RCL, and a Michaelis-type encounter complex is formed between enzyme and inhibitor. The subsequent formation of an acyl-ester bond between the proteinase and serpin (16Egelund R. Rodenburg K.W. Andreasen P.A. Rasmussen M.S. Guldberg R.E. Petersen T.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6375-6379Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) is associated with insertion of the RCL (as strand 4A) into β-sheet A of the serpin. There is evidence that loop insertion results in the translocation of the proteinase, linked to the P1 residue of the serpin, from its docking position to the opposite end of the serpin molecule (17Stratikos E. Gettins P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), but a serpin-proteinase crystal structure has not yet been obtained. This dramatic, irreversible conformational change in the serpin separates the P1 and P1′ residues by ∼70 Å and generates a C-terminal serpin fragment, which remains in the protein structure. The complex is only kinetically stable, dissociating after hours or days into active enzyme and cleaved, inactive inhibitor. The identity of the P1 residue is the major determinant of serpin inhibitory specificity, but other RCL residues, as well as serpin body-proteinase body interactions, are also involved (18Bottomley S.P. Stone S.R. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1243-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Plotnick M.I. Schechter N.M. Wang Z.M. Liu X. Rubin H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14601-14608Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus empirical testing and kinetic studies are required to identify target proteinases.Serpins are major albumins of wheat endosperm, with ∼3–4 mg of serpin/g of grain found in some bread wheat varieties (14Rosenkrands I. Hejgaard J. Rasmussen S.K. Bjorn S.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). About 40% total serpin can be extracted from flour with buffer or salt solutions. Subsequent extraction with a thiol reagent, e.g. 20 mm DTT, added to the buffer releases most of the remaining “bound” serpin together with “bound” β-amylase. One serpin with chymotrypsin inhibitor activity has been isolated from the thiol extract of bread wheat grain and partially sequenced (14Rosenkrands I. Hejgaard J. Rasmussen S.K. Bjorn S.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding a serpin (WSZ1, renamed WSZ1a in the present study) with an identical RCL sequence (P1′-P19′) was subsequently cloned and characterized kinetically as an inhibitor of enzymes with chymotrypsin-like specificity (7Dahl S.W. Rasmussen S.K. Hejgaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25083-25088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Rasmussen S.K. Dahl S.W. Norgard A. Hejgaard J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).We have now adapted a native PAGE system to characterize the serpin complement of bread wheat grain. Six serpins with distinct reactive center sequences were identified in the thiol extract. Four serpin cDNAs, in addition to that encoding WSZ1a, were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. As a step toward identification of their natural target enzymes, the inhibitory specificities of the five recombinant wheat serpins toward a panel of proteinases were determined. Interestingly, the reactive center of two of the five cloned serpins was found to be P1-P1′ Gln-Gln, whereas two of the other serpins contain a Gln residue at P1′. Reactive center Gln residues are extremely rare among serpins, and, to our knowledge, no other naturally occurring serpins for which inhibitory properties have been demonstrated contain P1 Gln.DISCUSSIONSix serpins with distinct reactive centers have been separated and identified among the major albumins in mature grain of hexaploid bread wheat (Fig. 1). Five of these serpins have been cloned, expressed inE. coli, and purified for characterization of their inhibitory specificity and elucidation of their physiological role(s) in the grain. Based on the classification of barley serpins into three subfamilies, BSZ4, BSZ7, and BSZx, sharing ∼75% amino acid identity, the sequences obtained in the present study (Fig. 2) suggested a classification of the five cloned wheat serpins into two new subfamilies, WSZ1 and WSZ2 (Fig. 3).The inhibitory specificity of a serpin is determined mainly by the sequence surrounding the RCL scissile bond cleaved during inhibition, especially the identity of the P1 residue (1Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landers Company, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). Major differences between the barley and wheat serpin sequences are found in the RCL. The three barley serpins contain RCL inhibitory-site residues commonly found in animal serpins, i.e. Arg, Leu, or Met in P1 and a conserved Ser in P1′ (1Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landers Company, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). Surprisingly, two of the five cloned wheat serpins contain P1-P1′ Gln-Gln, and two others have P1′ Gln, as confirmed by studies of inhibitory specificity and complex formation (Figs. 4 and 5). None of the >200 sequenced serpins of animal or viral origin contains a Gln in the P1position, and only one inhibitory serpin, from the insect Manduca sexta (29Jiang H. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1082-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), contains a Gln in P1′. Thus it was relevant to determine the inhibitory specificity of the wheat serpins with a selection of serine proteinases with well-characterized specificity. Comparing the k a values for inhibition of chymotrypsin, especially with WSZ1a, WSZ1b, and WSZ2a (Table I), suggests that serpins with Gln in P1 and/or P1′ are inhibitors as efficient as WSZ2a with P1-P1′ Leu-Ser, a reactive center found in many mammalian serpins, including α1-antichymotrypsin (1Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landers Company, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). Notably, WSZ1a and WSZ2a had very similar association rates (k a ∼ 105m−1 s−1), and WSZ1c was the fastest inhibitor of chymotrypsin (k a ∼ 106m−1 s−1). A correlation between k a values for inhibition of chymotrypsin and cathepsin G was not obvious (Table I), but the fastest inhibitor of cathepsin G was WSZ2a with P1′ Ser (k a ∼ 105m−1 s−1). As found for barley BSZx (7Dahl S.W. Rasmussen S.K. Hejgaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25083-25088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), WSZ2b could inhibit proteinases at overlapping sites in the RCL. Plasmin was irreversibly inhibited at P1 Arg, chymotrypsin at P2 Leu, and cathepsin G possibly at both sites. In contrast, inhibition of trypsin at P1 Arg was found to be reversible after incubation for <10 min (Fig. 6). A slow formation of stable complex combined with a high SI or cleavage at P5 Lys may explain the experiment results. Reversible inhibition has been previously associated with α2-antiplasmin, the primary plasmin inhibitor of the blood coagulation system, which inhibits plasmin irreversibly at P1-P1′ Arg-Met but trypsin reversibly at the same site (30Longstaff C. Gaffney P.J. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 3: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). WSZ2a could also inhibit pancreas elastase, but, due to substrate cleavage at several sites, the SI value was high (>20) and the inhibitory site, presumably at P1 Leu, could not be confirmed.Prolamins form the gluten protein fraction of crucial importance for making bread. The Pro- and Gln-rich prolamins account for approximately half the total grain nitrogen, and include the α-, γ-, and ω-gliadins and the LMW and HMW subunits of polymeric glutenin (31Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Tatham A.S. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar,32). The residue Gln, and more specifically, the Gln-Gln sequence, is found in abundance in the repetitive sequences of the prolamin wheat grain storage proteins. The reactive centers of many of the serpins resemble these repetitive sequences. The P2-P1′ sequence of WSZ1b (Fig. 4) appears twice in the repeated octapeptide sequence PQQPFPQQ in the N-terminal domain of γ-gliadin. Similarly, the P2-P1′ sequence of WSZ1a is identical to the last three residues of the repeat motif GYYPTSLQQ in the HMW subunit of glutenin, which also contains repeats of PGQGQQ and related sequences (31Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Tatham A.S. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 32). Most obvious is the similarity between the putative P2-P5′ sequence QQQMPIV of WSZ3 and sequences such as QQQIPIV present in repeats of LMW glutenin. The P4′-P5′ Pro-Pro sequence found in all five wheat serpins is also common in wheat prolamin repeats. During evolution, the wheat serpins may have adapted to inhibit proteinases involved in storage protein breakdown, either those from grain pests or those endogenous to the grain. Another possibility is that the RCL of the serpins acts as a substrate for a physiologically relevant conversion of the serpins from the native, stressed form to the cleaved, relaxed form, as shown recently for antithrombin (33O'Reilly M.S. Pirie-Shepherd S. Lane W.S. Folkman J. Science. 1999; 285: 1926-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar).To our knowledge, no chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases, or their genes, have been identified in plants. The plant serine proteinases with the most well-characterized specificity are cucumisin from ripe melon mesocarp (34Yamagata H. Masuzawa T. Nagaoka Y. Ohnishi T. Iwasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32725-32731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and hordolisin from barley green malt (23Terp N. Thomsen K.K. Svendsen I. Davy A. Simpson D.J. J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 156: 468-476Crossref Google Scholar). These plant subtilisin-like enzymes have a broad substrate specificity similar to that of bacterial subtilisins, but no inhibition was observed after incubation of either of the two enzymes with each of the five serpins. A few serpins display cross-class inhibition of cysteine proteinases (3Schick C. Pemberton P.A. Shi G.P. Kamachi Y. Cataltepe S. Bartuski A.J. Gornstein E.R. Bromme D. Chapman H.A. Silverman G.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5258-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), the most well-characterized being the inhibition at pH 5.5 of the lysosomal cysteine proteinases cathepsins K, L, and S by human squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 (3Schick C. Pemberton P.A. Shi G.P. Kamachi Y. Cataltepe S. Bartuski A.J. Gornstein E.R. Bromme D. Chapman H.A. Silverman G.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5258-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In wheat and barley, homologous cysteine proteinases with optimal activity slightly below pH 5 play a central role in degradation of the prolamin storage proteins during germination (22Davy A. Svendsen I. Sorensen S.O. Blom Sorensen M. Rouster J. Meldal M. Simpson D.J. Cameron-Mills V. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The specificity of barley malt cysteine proteinase EP-B is determined mainly by a large hydrophobic residue in P2 of the substrate, and Gln is among the readily accepted residues at P1. One of the preferred cleavage sites for EP-B in the highly repetitive prolamin sequences is LQ↓Q, and the most abundant site is PQ↓Q (22Davy A. Svendsen I. Sorensen S.O. Blom Sorensen M. Rouster J. Meldal M. Simpson D.J. Cameron-Mills V. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, the reactive centers of the wheat serpins should represent a selection of baits for EP-B, but none of the serpins inhibited EP-B at pH 5.0.The RCL sequences of certain mammalian serpins have been shown to accumulate amino acid substitutions at a higher rate than the rest of the sequence during evolution (35Goodwin R.L. Baumann H. Berger F.G. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 13: 346-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple α1-proteinase inhibitors with different target enzyme specificities in some animals has been suggested to constitute a defense response to exogenous proteinases from infectious parasites or predators, which developed by accelerated evolution of the RCL sequence (35Goodwin R.L. Baumann H. Berger F.G. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 13: 346-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Plant seeds, including cereal grains, contain numerous LMW protein inhibitors of proteinases (32, 36Ryan C.A. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1990; 28: 425-449Crossref Google Scholar). The majority of these inhibitors are abundantly present, and in most cases endogenous target enzymes have not been identified. The LMW inhibitors of serine proteinases in cereal grains are efficient inhibitors of subtilisin-like proteinases from microbes and/or chymotrypsin-like digestive proteinases of insects, and there is growing evidence for their participation in an integrated broad spectrum defense system against invading fungal or insect pests (32, 37Jongsma M.A. Bolter C. J. Insect Physiol. 1997; 43: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The repertoire of at least six distinct reactive centers in the abundant serpins of wheat grain may indicate that these inhibitors have similar functions. Kinetic studies showed that while barley BSZx was a fast inhibitor of subtilisins, the inhibition was inefficient, because ≥98% of the serpin was cleaved via the substrate pathway (Scheme FSI) (7Dahl S.W. Rasmussen S.K. Hejgaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25083-25088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the present study no inhibitory activity was found toward a fungal trypsin and a bacterial subtilisin, and it appears unlikely that the serpins are central components in defense against microbial attack of the grain.Many proteinase inhibitors, as well as inhibitors of other hydrolases, have been demonstrated to reduce the activity of insect digestive enzymes in vitro (37Jongsma M.A. Bolter C. J. Insect Physiol. 1997; 43: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Notably, grains of cereals, including wheat, contain specific insect α-amylase inhibitors that do not affect plant or mammalian amylases (32, 38Gutierrez C. Sanchez-Monge R. Gomez L. Ruiz-Tapiador M. Castanera P. Salcedo G. Plant Sci. 1990; 72: 37-44Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for protection of seeds against insect infestation comes from feeding tests using isolated proteinase inhibitors or seed lines with markedly different levels of inhibitor expression, as well as from studies using transgenic plants (32, 37Jongsma M.A. Bolter C. J. Insect Physiol. 1997; 43: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Notably, a serpin from the hemolymph of the insect M. sexta, as well as active-site engineered variants of the same protein, have been heterologously expressed in several plants at levels up to 0.1% of total plant protein and shown to limit plant damage by insect pests in some experiments (39Thomas J.C. Adams D.G. Keppenne V.D. Wasmann C.C. Brown J.K. Kanost M.R. Bohnert H.J. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 33: 611-614Google Scholar).The storage tissues of plant seeds are attractive food sources for many insects. Evolutionary adaptation of the proteolytic digestion system of some insects to efficient degradation of the abundant glutamine- and proline-rich repetitive structures of the cereal grain prolamins seems likely to have occurred. Here we have shown that the reactive centers of wheat grain serpins contain unique glutamine-rich sequences resembling repetitive sequences of wheat prolamins. A working hypothesis for further studies to elucidate the functions of the grain serpins might be that the RCL sequences have evolved into a complement of baits for irreversible inactivation of serine proteinases and, possibly, cysteine proteinases, from the digestive systems of insect pests, resulting in reduction of damage to seeds and thus in their increased survival. The serpins constitute a superfamily of versatile proteins participating in the regulation of complex proteolytic systems (1Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landers Company, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar, 2Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most serpins are serine proteinaseinhibitors of chymotrypsin-like enzymes, but a few have been found to inhibit cysteine proteinases (3Schick C. Pemberton P.A. Shi G.P. Kamachi Y. Cataltepe S. Bartuski A.J. Gornstein E.R. Bromme D. Chapman H.A. Silverman G.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5258-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and some are non-inhibitory. Many functionally distinct serpins have been identified in higher eukaryotes, some in viruses, but none in yeast or bacteria (4Marshall C.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1993; 342: 101-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Whisstock J.C. Irving J.A. Bottomley S.P. Pike R.N. Lesk A.M. Proteins. 1999; 36: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mammalian serpins have been shown to participate in a growing number of extra- and intracellular physiological processes, including blood coagulation, complement activation, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and hormone transport. The only plant serpin characterized in detail with respect to inhibitory specificity is recombinant barley (Hordeum vulgare) serpin rBSZx1(6Rasmussen S.K. Biochim. Biophys.

Despite the high concentration of these inhibitors in the grains of monocot cereals (up to 4% total protein), the physiological functions of plant serpins remain unknown. Increasing numbers of putative serpin genes and serpin mRNAs have been identified from other monocot plants, including rice and wild oats, from eudicot plants, including tomato, cotton, and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and from the non-vascular plant Physcomitrella patens (EMBL/GenBank), suggesting that serpins are widespread in the plant kingdom. Inhibitory serpins are metastable proteins (>40 kDa) employing a unique “suicide substrate” mechanism of irreversible inhibition very different from the reversible “standard mechanism” used by other proteinase inhibitors (<25 kDa) (1Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landers Company, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). The serpin in its native, active conformation has a flexible reactive center loop (RCL) located near the C terminus and protruding from the main body of the protein as a bait. The proteinase recognizes a specific peptide bond (P1-P1′) in the RCL, and a Michaelis-type encounter complex is formed between enzyme and inhibitor. The subsequent formation of an acyl-ester bond between the proteinase and serpin (16Egelund R. Rodenburg K.W. Andreasen P.A. Rasmussen M.S. Guldberg R.E. Petersen T.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6375-6379Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) is associated with insertion of the RCL (as strand 4A) into β-sheet A of the serpin. There is evidence that loop insertion results in the translocation of the proteinase, linked to the P1 residue of the serpin, from its docking position to the opposite end of the serpin molecule (17Stratikos E. Gettins P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), but a serpin-proteinase crystal structure has not yet been obtained. This dramatic, irreversible conformational change in the serpin separates the P1 and P1′ residues by ∼70 Å and generates a C-terminal serpin fragment, which remains in the protein structure. The complex is only kinetically stable, dissociating after hours or days into active enzyme and cleaved, inactive inhibitor. The identity of the P1 residue is the major determinant of serpin inhibitory specificity, but other RCL residues, as well as serpin body-proteinase body interactions, are also involved (18Bottomley S.P.

Many members of this family have been isolated, and three major subfamilies have been described as follows: TGF-βs, activins/inhibins, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) (reviewed in Refs. 1Derynck R.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). The effects of these cytokines are executed via ligand-induced heteromeric complex formation of different type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. In the resulting complex, the type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor, which then transmits the signal into the cell (2Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). Smad proteins have recently been defined as the main cytoplasmic transducing molecules in the TGF-β superfamily pathway. On the basis of structural and functional criteria, the Smad family has been divided into three subgroups (2Massagué J. Annu. Rev.

The receptor-regulated or pathway-restricted Smads (R-Smads) are directly phosphorylated by type I receptors. Smad2 and Smad3 propagate TGF-β and activin signals, whereas Smad1, Smad5, and possibly Smad8 are specific for BMP (2Massagué J. Annu. Rev.

However, studies of promoters ofDpp-responsive genes in Drosophila, such as vestigial and tinman, revealed GC-rich sequences as Mad and/or Medea (Drosophila Smad homologs) binding sequences (21Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Caroll S. Laughon A. Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Overall, these data indicate that Smads have relatively low DNA binding affinities and specificity. Furthermore, growing evidence suggests that Smads regulate transcription either by functional cooperation with transcription factors bound to adjacent sites or through direct association with DNA-bound transcription factors. For example, upon ligand stimulation, the forkhead transcription factors FAST1 and FAST2 recruit Smad 2/4 complexes to adjacent sites in the Mix.2 and goosecoidpromoters (22Chen X. Rubock M. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 383: 691-696Crossref Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 23Labbé E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol.

Smad3 and -4 interact with the Jun family of transcription factors and synergistically activate AP-1 promoter sequences (25Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 26Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physical interaction has also been shown between Smads and SIP1, a member of the δEF1 family of transcriptional repressors (27Verachueren K. Remacle J.E. Collart C. Kraft H. Baker B.S. Tyzanowski P. Nelles L. Wuytens G. Su M.-T. Bodmer R. Smith J.C. Huylebroeck D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20489-20498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). A similar scenario might occur with cooperative associations between Smad1 and Stat3 or Smad3 and vitamin D receptor. However, in these later cases, interactions require the presence of coactivators such as p300/CBP or steroid receptor coactivator-1, respectively (28Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Kimura N. Hisatsune T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Taga T. Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 29Yanagisawa J. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Suzawa M. Watanabe M. Kashiwagi K.

The NF-κB/rel family regulate transcription of several genes, mainly involved in immune or inflammation responses and cell growth control. A wide range of physiological and non-physiological stimuli can activate this transcription factor (30Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). Five members of the NF-κB/rel family have been identified in mammalian cells: p50, p52, p65/relA, relB, and c-rel. Before activation, NF-κB is in the cytoplasm of most cell types as homo- or heterodimers. Cytoplasmic NF-κB is an inactive complex through its association with the inhibitor proteins, IκBs (30Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 31May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). When cells are exposed to inductors of NF-κB, IκB is specifically phosphorylated. This phosphorylation is a signal for ubiquitination and later degradation of IκB by the 26 S proteasome (32Maniatis T. Science. 1997; 278: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). NF-κB is thus free to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes. Studies in vivo andin vitro indicate that different NF-κB dimers have different transcriptional activation properties. Moreover, evidence indicates that interactions between NF-κB and other transcription factors influence the ability of NF-κB to regulate gene expression in a selective manner. Consistent with this, Gerritsen et al.(33Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) have found that p65 and CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 interact to activate E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1. In addition, steroid receptor coactivator-1 interacts with p50 subunit but not with p65 and coactivates NF-κB (34Na S.-Y. Lee S.-K. Han S.J. Choi H.-S. Im S.-Y. Lee J.W. J. Biol.

Several enhancer sequences have been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of junB, a member of the AP-1 family of transcription factors, both in the 5′- and the 3′-flanking region of this intronless gene (35Perez-Albuerne E.D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) identified two Smad-binding sequences in the mouse junB 5′ promoter region that, when multimerized, mediate responsiveness by several members of the TGF-β superfamily. In this report, we have investigated the transcriptional regulation of the immediate early genejunB by TGF-β. We analyzed the downstream region of the gene and identified an NF-κB site as a TGF-β− responsive region. We demonstrate that NF-κB sites are sufficient to mediate transcriptional activation by TGF-β. This activation requires an intact NF-κB pathway and is mediated by Smad family members. Finally, we show that Smad proteins interact with NF-κB subunits. These data further support a role for Smads as transcriptional coactivators, in addition to their role as DNA-binding transcription factors.

Thompson. pJB2035-2072 and pJB2040-2068CAGAmut and pJB2040-2068NF-κBmut were generated as follows: oligonucleotides 5′-CTGCCCAGCAGAGTGCGCCGGGGCTTTCCCCGCTGAC-3′ for wild type; 5′-CAGTTGAGTGCGCCGGGGCTTTCCCCGC-3′ for CAGAmut; 5′-CAGCAGAGTGCGCCGATACTTTCCCCGC-3′ for NF-κBmut, and their respective complementary counterparts were phosphorylated at 5′ ends, annealed, and ligated with pJB, containing the minimal junB promoter-luciferase gene construct, or with pGL-2fos, containing the minimal c-fos promoter. pNF-κB-Luc, which contains two NF-κB sites (5′-AGGGGACTTTCCGAGAGG-3′) in front of the minimal c-fos promoter, MEKK-1DN, and IκBαDN were kindly provided by P. Muñoz. 3TP-Lux, Smad1, Myc Smad3, and FLAG Smad4 were provided by J. Massagué. Wild type rhoA,cdc42, and rac1 and their dominant negative and constitutively active mutants were provided by X. R. Bustelo, whereas arf6 constructs were obtained from J. Donaldson. Expression vectors for NF-κB subunits p50, p52, p65, c-Rel, and RelB, were provided by J. Caamaño. Mv1Lu and COS cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The R1B/L17 cells, provided by J. Massagué, were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium without histidine, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and 0.5 mm histidinol. Cells were grown in a 10% CO2atmosphere with 95% humidity. Cell transfection was performed by the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (19Vindevoghel L. Kon A. Lechleider R.J. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13053-13057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). When different combinations of plasmids were used, total DNA was kept constant by the addition of empty vector. Mv1Lu cells were split 24 h after transient transfection, cultured in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% fetal calf serum serum, and treated with 200 pm human recombinant TGF-β1 (Sigma) or 1 nm BMP2 (Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) for 16 h. Luciferase activities were quantified using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Proteasome inhibitor,N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (Sigma), or brefeldin A were added 15 min before TGF-β. Luciferase values are expressed as mean ± S.E. of transfection experiments performed in triplicates in three to six independent experiments. Nuclear extracts were prepared from control and TGF-β- or PDB-treated Mv1Lu as follows. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold Buffer A (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm NaF) by flicking the tube. After a 10-min incubation on ice, cells were vortexed for 30 s and then centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of ice-cold buffer C (20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 20 min for high salt extraction. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 2 min, and supernatants were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The protein content was determined using the Bradford protein concentration assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. The NF-κB oligonucleotide 5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′ (Promega) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Ten micrograms of the nuclear proteins were diluted to a final volume of 20 μl in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 1.25 μg of poly(dI-dC). Where indicated, unlabeled oligonucleotides or antibodies (H-119 for p50; K-27 for p52; H-286 for p65; C-19 for RelB and B-6 for c-Rel from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added and the samples incubated on ice for 15 min before adding 0.1 pmol of labeled probe (5–10 × 104cpm). After a 20-min incubation on ice, the reaction mixture was loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel, 0.25× TBE, and 2.5% glycerol and resolved at 20 mA for 2.5 h. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. For detection of NF-κB subunits and IκBs, Mv1Lu cells were serum-starved and treated with TGF-β for different times. Then cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with sample buffer 1× (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 100 mmdithiothreitol and 0.25 mg/ml bromphenol blue). Cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline 48 h after transfection and lysed with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm imidazole. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 1 min. The supernatant fraction was incubated with 30 μl of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were washed four times in lysis buffer, and pellet was resuspended in sample buffer two times. Bound Smad3 was detected by Western blotting using anti-Myc antibody as described above. Protein extracts were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for detection of IκBs and 10% for Smads and NF-κB subunits, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to Western blot using specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies as follows: FLAG-tagged Smad4, Myc-tagged Smad3, and His-tagged p52 were detected by immunoblotting using a 1:1000 dilution of monoclonal antibodies to the FLAG epitope (Sigma), the Myc epitope (9E10), and the His epitope (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). IκBs were detected with a 1:1000 dilution of antibodies H4 for IκBα, C-20 for IκBβ, and M-364 for IκBε (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or the antibodies against NF-κB subunits described for electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Immunocomplexes were detected with the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Previously, we and others (39Chalaux E. López-Rovira T. Rosa J.L. Bartrons R. Ventura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 537-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have shown thatjunB is an immediate early gene induced by members of the TGF-β family. Preliminary experiments, undertaken to identify regulatory elements upstream of mouse junB gene, identified a region that confers a slight response to TGF-β family members (Ref.39Chalaux E. López-Rovira T. Rosa J.L. Bartrons R. Ventura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 537-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and data not shown), which might correspond to the responsive enhancer described by Jonk et al. (37Jonk L.J.C. Itoh S. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). We further our study by focusing on the 3′-downstream region of this intronless gene, which has been shown to mediate induction of its expression by serum, growth factors, phorbol esters, or forskolin (35Perez-Albuerne E.D. Schatteman G. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11960-11964Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 36Brown R.T. Ades I.Z. Nordan R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31129-31135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Transfection of PJB 2028-2249-luc, which contains these downstream response elements and the basal junB promoter, into Mv1Lu cells elicited a small, but consistent, response to TGF-β (Fig.1 B). To localize the minimal effective region, partial constructs were assayed showing that the region from +2035 to +2072 was still fully responsive to TGF-β, whereas the region from +2071 to +2249 did not support significant reporter induction (Fig. 1 B). Sequence analysis indicates that this responsive region contains both a single SBE and a single κB site. To determine the specific role of NF-κB and SBE sites in the induction of the junB expression by TGF-β, we compared constructions containing point mutations of the κB or SBE sites. As shown in Fig. 1 C mutations of the SBE had no effect on activation by TGF-β, whereas mutations in the κB site completely suppressed reporter inducibility. In addition, a reporter construct containing two consensus NF-κB-binding sites in front of the c-fos minimal promoter conferred stronger reporter stimulation by TGF-β (Fig. 1 C). Thus, these results seem to indicate that a κB site localized at +2054 is sufficient for TGF-β-mediated activation of the junB gene in both homologous and heterologous promoter contexts. To investigate the TGF-β effect through κB sites, we used the reporter driven by κB consensus sequences that confers the strongest response. Whereas TGF-β confers 4–5-fold induction, BMP-2 had no effect on reporter activity in Mv1Lu cells (Fig.2 A). To assess whether induction from κB sites required signals initiated by functional TGF-β receptors, we used the Mv1Lu clone R1B/L17, which is unresponsive to TGF-β due to mutations in type I receptor (38Cárcamo J. Weis F.M.B. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β only showed effects in R1B cells after reconstitution of type I receptor (Fig. 2 A). In addition, dose-response experiments showed activation at TGF-β concentrations in agreement with the affinities of TGF-β receptors (Fig. 2 B). We also performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays with a radiolabeled NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide incubated with nuclear extracts of cells treated with TGF-β or phorbol dibutyrate (PDB), a known inductor of NF-κB activity. Fig. 2 C shows that NF-κB binding activity was increased in Mv1Lu cells treated with both factors. However, although the PDB effect was detected after 30 min, TGF-β effect was not detectable until 3 h after growth factor addition. This led us to examine the possibility that TGF-β could induce the release of a cytokine to the extracellular medium, which would be responsible for NF-κB induction. We treated cells with TGF-β and brefeldin A, which is a potent inhibitor of transport of newly synthesized proteins from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi (40Chardin P. McCormick F. Cell. 1999; 97: 153-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Brefeldin A, either at 1 or 5 μg/ml, had no significant effect on reporter responses for either the κB or the Smad-responsive construct 3TP-lux (Fig. 3 A). We then examined the time course of κB reporter induction in further details. As shown in Fig. 3 B, cells treated with TGF-β or PDB gave the same temporal pattern of induction. A similar pattern was also found with 3TPlux, which binds Smads and confers immediate responses to TGF-β (13Dennler S. Itoh S. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). Since the activation profile of either NF-κB or 3TP-lux transcription after PDB or TGF-β addition follows a very rapid pattern, these results suggest that TGF-β induces NF-κB transcriptional activity in an immediate manner. A number of stimuli increase DNA binding activity through induction of expression of specific NF-κB subunits or by control of their translocation to the nucleus through IκBs. IκBs are phosphorylated by a multiprotein IκB-kinase complex and then ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome (32Maniatis T. Science. 1997; 278: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To test whether the TGF-β effect proceeds via an increase in expression of NF-κB subunits, we analyzed their expression by Western blotting. No changes were found for either p50, p52, p65, RelB, or c-Rel up to 4 h after TGF-β addition (Fig. 3 C). To assess the role of TGF-β in IκB degradation, we also analyzed the levels of IκB-α, -β and -ε. Whereas PDB induced a significant decrease in IκB levels, we were unable to detect significant changes caused by TGF-β treatment (Fig. 3 D). These data suggest that TGF-β increases transactivation activity of NF-κB through a mechanism other than the classic pathway of IκB degradation. To investigate whether NF-κB activity is required for TGF-β to activate κB sites, we blocked this pathway at two levels. First, we overexpressed a dominant negative mutant of IκB, which cannot be phosphorylated and thus cannot be recognized by the ubiquitination and degradation machinery. Overexpression of this mutant form significantly reduced both the uninduced and the TGF-β-induced expression of our reporter system (Fig. 4 A). In addition, we also overexpressed a dominant negative mutant of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-1 (MEKK-1). MEKK-1 is one of the activators of IKK (41Yin M.-J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.-T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We found that the induction by TGF-β was also reduced when activation of IKK by MEKK-1 was blocked. LLnL inhibits the activity of 26 S proteasome and blocks degradation of phosphorylated IκBs (32, Fig. 3 C). Our results showed that TGF-β did not induce activation of the reporter when cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 4 B). There were no differences between control and treated cells when 3TPlux reporter was transfected, suggesting that LLnL has no effect on TGF-β signaling or cell viability. Taken together, these results indicate that TGF-β-induced gene expression from κB binding sites requires NF-κB activity. Many stimuli can activate NF-κB, such as inflamma"

https://openalex.org/W1966230375,"The role of glial cells in neuronal death has become a major research interest. Glial cell activation has been demonstrated to accompany cerebral ischemia. However, there is disagreement whether such gliosis is a cell death or a neuroprotective response. In the present study, we examined alterations in glial cell responses to the reported neuroprotective action of the free radical scavenger, melatonin, against cerebral ischemia. Adult male Wistar rats were given oral injections of either melatonin (26 micromol/rat) or saline just prior to 1 h occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), then once daily for 11 or 19 consecutive days. At 11 and 19 days after reperfusion of the MCA, randomly selected animals were killed and their brains removed for immunohistochemical assays. Melatonin significantly enhanced survival of glial cells (as revealed by glial cell specific markers, glial fibrillary acidic protein and aquaporin-4 immunostaining) at both time periods postischemia, and the preservation of these glial cells in the ischemic penumbra corresponded with a markedly reduced area of infarction (detected by immunoglobulin G and hematoxylin-eosin staining), as well as increased neuronal survival. The ischemia-induced locomotor deficits were partially ameliorated in melatonin-treated animals. In vitro replications of ischemia by serum deprivation or by exposure to free radical-producing toxins (sodium nitroprusside and 3-nitropropionic acid) revealed that melatonin (10 microg/ml or 100 microM) treatment of pure astrocytic cultures significantly reduced astrocytic cell death. These results suggest a potential strategy directed at enhancing glial cell survival as an alternative protective approach against ischemic damage."

Three-dimensional numerical modeling shows that this deformation is consistent with the dilation of a dike within Kilauea's rift zones coupled with creep over a narrow area of a low-angle fault beneath the south flank. Magma supply is estimated to be 0.18 cubic kilometers per year, twice that of previous estimates. The 1983 eruption may be a direct consequence of the high rates of magma storage within the rift zone that followed the 1975 earthquake."

The amount of mutant proteins and/or the residual activity can be rescued by chaperonin co-overexpression in Escherichia coli or growth at low temperature in COS cells.

Defects in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (GenBankTM cDNA reference sequence U49897, MIM 261600) cause phenylketonuria (PKU), a recessive disorder that if not treated from birth leads to variable degrees of mental retardation. PKU is in many ways regarded as a “model genetic disease,” as clinical and biochemical characteristics are well defined, an effective treatment has been successfully implemented, both the gene and the enzyme are well characterized, mutations have been identified, genotype-phenotype correlations have been established, and an animal model has been produced (1Levy H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1811-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although PKU is a classical monogenic disorder, the associated features are complex, as pointed out by Scriver and Waters (2Scriver C.R. Waters P.J. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 267-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). From the genetic point of view, more than 380 mutations have been described associated to different populations (3Nowacki P. Byck S. Prevost L. Scriver C.R.

After defining the mutational spectrum of PKU in several populations, the aim of the researchers has been the study of the genotype-phenotype correlations (4Kayaalp E. Treacy E. Waters P.J. Byck S.

Genet. 1998; 63: 71-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). V388M is one of the most frequent mutations in Spain, and we have shown that it retains 43% activity in COS cells (16Desviat L.R. Pérez B. De Lucca M. Cornejo V. Schmidt B. Ugarte M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 337-342PubMed Google Scholar), although normal levels of mutant immunoreactive proteins were detected. This apparent catalytic effect is discrepant with the fact that V388M affects residues located outside the active site in the three-dimensional structure of the PAH enzyme (13Erlandsen H. Fusetti F. Martinez A. Hough E. Flatmark T. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). On the contrary, S349L is located lining the active site, but expression both in COS cells and in Escherichia coli rendered a highly unstable protein (17De Lucca M. Pérez B. Desviat L.R. Ugarte M. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To clarify and extend these results, we have used several complementary expression systems (eukaryotic and prokaryotic) and experimental conditions (co-overexpression with chaperonins, different growth temperatures), providing evidence that the mutations affect directly the folding and stability of the protein. Additionally, we observe that the S349L mutation also affects the catalytic properties of the enzyme, which is attributable to the fact that serine 349 is involved in the iron binding site. Mutant PAH subunit interaction has been examined by the two-hybrid system in mammalian cells, and altered oligomerization is documented by size exclusion chromatography of mutant PAH expressed in the E. coli system. The different experimental approaches employed allow the demonstration of a major folding defect of the mutations causing protein instability, which can be modulated experimentally, revealing a possible mechanism to account for the existing inconsistencies in the genotype-phenotype correlations.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression analysis was performed in COS cells using the pRc/CMV expression vector (Invitrogen), as described previously (16Desviat L.R. Pérez B. De Lucca M. Cornejo V. Schmidt B. Ugarte M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 337-342PubMed Google Scholar), and inE. coli using pMALc2 (Biolabs) where PAH is cloned as a fusion protein with MBP under the control of an inducible promoter (17De Lucca M. Pérez B. Desviat L.R. Ugarte M. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 18Martinez A. Knappskog P.M. Olafsdottir S. Doskeland A.P. Eiken H.G. Svebak R.M. Bozzini M. Apold J. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced in the PAH cDNA sequence by site-directed mutagenesis using the Gene Editor kit from Promega. COS cells (4 × 106 or 6 × 105), grown at 37 or 27 °C were transfected with the Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc). The plasmid pGroESL bearing the GroES and GroEL genes and the chloramphenicol resistance marker was from DuPont. The plasmids pMALc2-PAH wild-type or pMALc2-PAH mutant were cotransformed with pGroESL into E. coli JM109, and the colonies were selected using LB plates with ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml) and chloramphenicol (0.1 mg/ml). Cells were grown at 37 °C, and expression of MBP·PAH fusion proteins and of GroES and GroEL was induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. At the same time, 0.2 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate was added. Bacteria were harvested 16–21 h after induction and disrupted by sonication in Na-Hepes 20 mm, NaCl 0.2M, pH 7.0, with 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.2 mm Pefabloc. After centrifugation, the supernatant (crude protein extract) was used to measure PAH residual activity by monitoring conversion of 14C-Phe to 14C-Tyr (17De Lucca M. Pérez B. Desviat L.R. Ugarte M. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, the standard reaction mixture performed in a 50-μl final volume contained 150–300 μg of total protein, catalase (10 μl at a concentration 100 units/μl), 14C-Phe (0.5 μCi, >450 mCi/mmol), and 10 μl of 1 mm6-methyltetrahydropterin (synthetic cofactor, added last), in 20 mm Na-Hepes, 0.2 m NaCl, pH 7. After 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. A 6-μl sample of the supernatant was spotted onto a TLC plate, developed two times in chloroform:methanol:amonia (55:35:10), dried, and visualized by autoradiography.Wild-type and mutant fusion proteins were purified in an amylose column equilibrated with 20 mm Na-Hepes, 0.2 m NaCl, pH 7.0, and eluted with buffer containing 10 mm maltose (18Martinez A. Knappskog P.M. Olafsdottir S. Doskeland A.P. Eiken H.G. Svebak R.M. Bozzini M. Apold J. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). PAH activity was also measured in the purified fraction, using 30–60 μg of protein. Size exclusion chromatography of the purified fusion proteins was performed at 4 °C following the conditions described (18Martinez A. Knappskog P.M. Olafsdottir S. Doskeland A.P. Eiken H.G. Svebak R.M. Bozzini M. Apold J. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and using a HiLoad Superdex 200HR column (1.6 cm × 60 cm) prepacked from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The fast protein liquid chromatography system, UV monitor, and recorder were all from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Assignation of the different enzyme forms to the peaks obtained in the chromatograms was done by comparison with previously published elution positions of tetramers and dimers of the fusion protein (18Martinez A. Knappskog P.M. Olafsdottir S. Doskeland A.P. Eiken H.G. Svebak R.M. Bozzini M. Apold J. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and by molecular mass value estimation using calibration curves obtained by running the following standard proteins, obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech: ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa). Blue dextran and acetone were used to determine the void volume (V0 = 44.06 ml) and the exclusion volume (VT = 114.9 ml), respectively.The cleavage of PAH protein from the MBP fusion partner was performed with Xa factor (ratio protein:Xa factor 1:100) at 4 °C for 3 h. The reaction was further incubated at 4 or 37 °C, and aliquots were removed at different times up to 24 h. After SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, MBP and PAH proteins were quantified by laser densitometry.The TnT-T7 transcription-translation system from Promega was used for pulse-chase experiments. The wild-type and mutant PAH cDNAs cloned in the pRc/CMV vector were amplified using a sense primer that introduces the T7 promoter and the consensus Kozak sequences close to the ATG initiation codon (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGCCACCATGTCCACTGCGGTCCTGGAA-3′). Five microliters of the polymerase chain reaction product from the wild type and mutant cDNAs were mixed with the reticulocyte lysate and [35S]methionine-cysteine (14.3 mCi/ml). After a 35-min incubation at 30 °C the reaction was stopped with excess cold methionine, RNase (1 mg/ml), and DNase (1 mg/ml). The whole reaction was incubated at 37 °C, and aliquots were removed at different times between 1 and 8 h. All samples were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the labeled PAH protein was quantitated by laser densitometry after fluorography.Thermal stability profiles were performed with purified fusion proteins MBP·PAH expressed in E. coli. Aliquots (20 μl, containing 30–60 μg of purified protein) were incubated at different temperatures for 10 min and chilled on ice. PAH enzyme activity was subsequently measured as described above.For two-hybrid analysis we have used the Mammalian Matchmaker two-hybrid assay kit (CLONTECH). The plasmid pGL-G5 (kindly provided by P. Stäheli) was used as reporter vector containing the luciferase gene under the control of the Gal4 promoter. The full-length human PAH cDNA was excised from phPAH247 (19Kwok S.C.M. Ledley F.D. DiLella A.G. Robson K.J.H. Woo S.L.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) withSmaI and EcoRI and subcloned into pBluescript. To introduce the normal PAH as fusion protein to the GAL4 (binding domain, BD) and VP16 (activating domain, AD) proteins, the PAH cDNA was excised from pBluescript with BamHI and XbaI and ligated with the AD and BD vectors previously digested with the same enzymes. Both plasmids with the normal cDNA were sequenced using a fmol sequencing kit (Promega) to confirm the in-frame cloning. The GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system from Promega was used to introduce the L348V, S349L, and V388M mutations in the PAH sequence. COS cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well. In each transfection 1 μg of each plasmid (reporter vector, AD-PAH and BD-PAH vectors) was introduced using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were harvested after 72 h, and luciferase activity was measured. In the transfection experiments using pRc/CMVPAH or in the two-hybrid system, PAH proteins were detected by Western blot using PH8 anti-PAH monoclonal antibody (20Hufton S.E. Jennings I.G. Cotton R.G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).For the homology modeling, three-dimensional models of L348V, S349L, and V388M were built on the basis of the human phenylalanine hydroxylase coordinates determined by x-ray crystallography (13Erlandsen H. Fusetti F. Martinez A. Hough E. Flatmark T. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 14Fusetti F. Erlandsen H. Flatmark T. Stevens R.C. J. Biol.

In the respective models, the formerly introduced alanine residues at the corresponding mutation sites were exchanged for the correct residues. The models were optimized for stereochemistry and refined by energy minimization using X-PLOR (21Brunger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1, a System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven1992Google Scholar). The energy-minimized structures were heated at 1000 K and were further refined with a slow cooling simulated annealing molecular dynamics protocol using X-PLOR.RESULTSAs described in a preliminary report, we have overexpressed and affinity purified PAH protein as fusion protein with MBP (17De Lucca M. Pérez B. Desviat L.R. Ugarte M. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). PAH with the S349L mutation produced an unstable protein undetectable in SDS-PAGE. The expression of this mutation in eukaryotic cells showed that the mutant enzyme was not detected by Western blot, and consequently no residual activity in bacteria nor in COS cells could be measured (17De Lucca M. Pérez B. Desviat L.R. Ugarte M. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this work we have extended the expression analysis to two other mutations, L348V and V388M, which have been previously reported to retain residual activity in COS cells, 25–33% for L348V (3Nowacki P. Byck S. Prevost L. Scriver C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and 43% for V388M (16Desviat L.R. Pérez B. De Lucca M. Cornejo V. Schmidt B. Ugarte M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 337-342PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the emerging view that many missense mutations in human disease cause defective folding resulting in protein instability (22Bross P Corydon T.J. Andresen B.S. Jorgensen M.M. Bolund L. Gregersen N. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 14: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), we have tested this hypothesis using different experimental approaches known to prevent missfolding of proteins expressed in eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems.Prokaryotic Expression StudiesIn prokaryotes, PAH was expressed as a fusion protein with MBP. Expression of the mutant proteins compared with the wild type resulted in a variable but lower yield of fusion protein. When we performed the co-overexpression of the plasmid pGroESL, there was a considerable increase in the amount of fusion protein, both for wild type and mutant PAH, although the effect was more pronounced for the mutant proteins, especially for PAH harboring S349L, which as described before, was undetectable without chaperonin coexpression (Fig. 1). Thus, high levels of GroES and GroEL have a clear stabilizing effect on the mutant proteins, revealing a primary defect in folding and/or oligomer assembly. The increase in mutant protein correlated with an increase in residual catalytic activity with chaperonin coexpression, except for the S349L mutation, for which no enzyme activity is rescued (Table I).Table IExpression analysis of PKU mutations in different systemsPAHExpression in E. coli (−GroESL)Expression in E. coli (+GroESL)Expression in COS cellsTwo hybrid system interactionActivityOligomeric state (proportion)ActivityOligomeric state (proportion)37 °C27 °CActivityProteinActivityProtein%%%%%%%Wild-type100Aggregates (27%)100Aggregates (20%)100100100100100Tetramers (60%)Tetramers (66%)Dimers (13%)Dimers (14%)L348V25Aggregates (35%)55Aggregates (53%)3870778273Tetramers (28%)Tetramers (34%)Dimers (37%)Dimers (13%)S349L0No protein0Aggregates (100%)0009010V388M40Aggregates (59%)82Aggregates (34%)4398788291Tetramers (18%)Tetramers (50%)Dimers (23%)Dimers (17%)Data obtained from the expression analysis of wild-type and mutant forms of PAH in E. coli with and without chaperonins, in COS cells at different temperatures and in a two-hybrid system. Oligomeric state and proportion (percentage of total) of fusion proteins in E. coli were estimated by size exclusion chromatography (see Fig. 2 and “Experimental Procedures”). In the two-hybrid assay, the relative strength of interaction between PAH subunits was measured as luciferase activity, 100% interaction is the luciferase activity when wild-type PAH cDNA is present on both activating and binding domain; in the rest of the assays, the mutations are present on the activation domain. The data represent the mean of three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab The oligomeric state of the fusion proteins was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. It has previously been described that the oligomeric structure of PAH is similar as fusion protein with MBP and as isolated enzyme (18Martinez A. Knappskog P.M. Olafsdottir S. Doskeland A.P. Eiken H.G. Svebak R.M. Bozzini M. Apold J. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 23Knappskog P.M. Flatmark T. Aarden J.M. Haavik J. Martinez A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and our results also show that the wild-type fusion protein is resolved into three main components, a fraction of high molecular mass aggregates, eluting at the column void volume, a major fraction corresponding to tetramers, and a minor component of dimers. With chaperonin coexpression, there is no substantial change in the oligomeric profile of the wild-type protein (Fig. 2). Regarding the mutant proteins, L348V and V388M fusion proteins show a much lower proportion of tetramers and increased amounts of aggregated forms. When V388M is coexpressed with GroES and GroEL, a major peak corresponding to the tetrameric form is observed with a concomitant decrease in aggregated forms. For L348V with chaperonins the proportion of tetramers also increases, although there is still a considerable amount of aggregates (Fig. 2). In contrast, the S349L protein rescued by chaperonin coexpression is exclusively recovered as aggregates.Figure 2Size exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad Superdex column of affinity purified MBP· PAH fusion proteins expressed with or without chaperonins. The column was equilibrated and eluted with 20 mm Hepes and 0.2 m NaCl, pH 7.0, at a flow rate of 0.38 ml/min. Peak positions: thearrow points to the position of the tetramers. Retention times were 107–116 min, aggregated forms; 137–139 min, tetrameric form; and 155–158 min, dimeric form. For each MBP·PAH fusion protein, the following amount was loaded on the column: wild-type, 380 μg; wild-type (+ GroESL), 400 μg; V388M, 54 μg; V388M (+ GroESL), 170 μg; L348V, 13 μg; L348V(+ GroESL), 120 μg. For ease of comparison the sensitivity of the detector in the chromatograms of V388M and L348V without chaperonins was 5-fold greater than for the rest of the chromatograms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In addition to impaired folding, the mutations could also be affecting the stability of the assembled enzyme. Therefore, we analyzed the thermal inactivation profiles for the L348V and V388M fusion proteins purified in the pMalc2 expression system. The curves of the mutant enzymes are clearly shifted to lower temperature, demonstrating a reduced stability (Fig. 3). The half-denaturation temperatures were 59 °C for the wild-type enzyme, 50 °C for L348V, and 51 °C for the V388M mutant protein. Similar denaturation profiles were observed if the enzymes were expressed with or without chaperonins.Figure 3Thermal inactivation profiles of normal and mutant (L348V and V388M) PAH enzymes. Aliquots of the affinity purified fusion proteins were incubated at various temperatures for 10 min and chilled on ice. PAH enzyme activity was subsequently measured. The residual enzyme activities (percentage of the maximum value obtained) are plotted versus the incubation temperature. The mean values from two independent experiments each with fusion protein expressed with (panel B) or without (panel A) chaperonins are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Another approach used to analyze the effect of the PAH mutations on the stability of the protein was performed after digestion with factor Xa of the purified normal and mutant fusion proteins. The cleaved proteins were subsequently incubated at 4 or 37 °C up to 24 h, and the Coomassie Blue-stained bands were quantified by laser densitometry. After cleavage, MBP and wild-type PAH are essentially stable up to 24 h, the ratio PAH/MBP is close to 1 up to 24 h. In contrast, immediately after cleavage, the amount of detectable mutant PAH forms, expressed as PAH/MBP ratio, is reduced to 50% (for V388M), 40% (L348V), or 20% (in the case of S349L). This remaining mutant protein is stable up to 24 h. Similar data are obtained if the fusion proteins are coexpressed with or without chaperonins (data not shown).Eukaryotic Expression StudiesTo test the relevance of these results obtained in the E. coli expression system, the mutations were also expressed in COS cells at different temperatures, 27 and 37 °C. At low temperature, S349L mutant protein could be detected by Western blot analysis, reaching near normal levels, although no activity was rescued. Both L348V and V388M showed an increase in residual activity at 27 °C, from 38 to 77% and from 43 to 78%, respectively. Western blot analysis revealed similar levels of immunoreactive protein for the wild-type and mutant proteins expressed at both temperatures (Table I).Expression by in Vitro Tran"

This relatively low activity is accounted for the catalytic residue of cit-PHGPx, which was found to be cysteine and not the rare selenocysteine (Sec) present in animal enzymes. Sec incorporation into proteins is encoded by a UGA codon, usually a STOP codon, which, in prokaryotes, is suppressed by an adjacent downstream mRNA stem-loop structure, the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS). By performing appropriate nucleotide substitutions into the gene encoding cit-PHGPx, we introduced bacterial-type SECIS elements that afforded the substitution of the catalytic Cys41 by Sec, as established by mass spectrometry, while preserving the functional integrity of the peroxidase. The recombinant enzyme, whose synthesis is selenium-dependent, displayed a 4-fold enhanced peroxidase activity as compared with the Cys-containing analog, thus confirming the higher catalytic power of Sec compared with Cys in cit-PHGPx active site. The study led also to refinement of the minimal sequence requirements of the bacterial-type SECIS, and, for the first time, to the heterologous expression inEscherichia coli of a eukaryotic selenoprotein containing a SECIS in its open reading frame.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Because of the ionization and redox properties of selenium, Sec residues usually play a crucial role in the biological activity of selenoproteins; indeed, most have been characterized as oxido-reductase enzymes. Among these selenoenzymes, the mammalian family of glutathione peroxidases (GPx), which catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, lipid hydroperoxides, and other organic hydroperoxides by utilizing glutathione, was mostly investigated (3Flohe L. Yagi K. Lipid Peroxides in Biology and Medicine. Academic Press, New York1982: 149-159Crossref Google Scholar, 4Ursini F. Maiorino M. Brigelius F.R. Aumann K.D. Roveri A. Schomburg D. Flohe L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 38-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). A member of this family, namely the phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx), was shown to play a key role in the cell protection against oxidative damage, presumably by its ability to control the peroxidation of unsaturated phospholipids comprised in biological membranes (5Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Ursini F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar,6Arai M. Imai H. Koumura T. Yoshida M. Emoto K. Umeda M. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4924-4933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The citrus PHGPx (cit-PHGPx), encoded by the csa gene, was isolated and characterized in our laboratory and found to exhibit structure and substrate specificity similar to that of the animal PHGPx (7Ben-Hayyim G. Faltin Z. Gepstein S. Camoin L. Strosberg A.D. Eshdat Y. Plant Sci. 1993; 88: 129-140Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 8Faltin Z. Camoin L. Ben-Hayyim G. Perl A. Beeor-Tzahar T. Strosberg A.D. Holland D. Eshdat Y. Physiol. Plant. 1998; 104: 741-746Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the cit-PHGPx catalytic residue, as well as that of other plant analogs so far identified, is Cys and not Sec, which is the one present in mammalian enzymes (8Faltin Z. Camoin L. Ben-Hayyim G. Perl A. Beeor-Tzahar T. Strosberg A.D. Holland D. Eshdat Y. Physiol. Plant. 1998; 104: 741-746Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As predicted, considering the lower reductive power under physiological conditions of Cys as compared with Sec, this difference in their catalytic site affects the enzymatic properties of the plant peroxidase. We found the enzymatic activity of the cit-PHGPx to be 500-fold weaker than that of the pig heart PHGPx, and similar to that of the engineered pig heart PHGPx, in which the catalytic Sec was replaced by a Cys residue by point mutagenesis (9Maiorino M. Aumann K.D. Brigelius-Flohe R. Doria D. van den Heuvel J. McCarthy J. Roveri A. Ursini F. Flohe L. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar,10Eshdat Y. Holland D. Faltin Z. Ben-Hayyim G. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 234-240Crossref Google Scholar). In all organisms investigated so far, Sec is encoded by a UGA opal codon, usually a STOP codon (11Zinoni F. Birkmann A. Leinfelder W. Bock A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the presence of a downstream mRNA stem-loop structure, designated as the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS), precludes termination of the polypeptide biosynthesis and promotes Sec incorporation into the nascent protein (2Stadtman T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 13Baron C. Bock A. Soll D. RhajBhandary U. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1995: 529-544Google Scholar). Trans elements are also required for this decoding process, including a peculiar tRNASec, encoded by theselC gene, which carries a UCA anticodon (14Leinfelder W. Zehelein E. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Bock A. Nature. 1988; 331: 723-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). This tRNASec is recognized by a specific elongation factor, SelB, which interacts specifically with both tRNASec and the mRNA stem-loop structure (15Kromayer M. Wilting R. Tormay P. Bock A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism that affords Sec incorporation into the polypeptide chain was identified in the bacterial and animal kingdoms but differs substantially between the two. In eukaryotes, the SECIS is located in the 3′-untranslated region of the mRNA. It has been shown that fusing a mammalian SECIS to the mRNA of any protein can direct Sec incorporation at each UGA codon introduced in the open reading frame (ORF) (16Berry M.J. Banu L. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 17Shen Q. Chu F.F. Newburger P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11463-11469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the Escherichia coli fdhF gene, encoding the Sec-containing formate dehydrogenase H, the stem-loop structure is immediately adjacent to the 3′ side of the UGA codon and is therefore part of the ORF (18Zinoni F. Heider J. Bock A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4660-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Consequently, expression of a eukaryotic selenoprotein in transformed bacteria would require the presence of a bacterial-type SECIS inside the ORF of the recombinant protein. Because of these species-specific requirements, attempts to obtain heterologous expression of genes coding for eukaryotic selenoproteins have been unsuccessful so far (19Tormay P. Bock A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 576-582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except for the thioredoxin reductase (20Gladyshev V.N. Krause M. Xu X.M. Korotkov K.V. Kryukov G.V. Sun Q.A. Lee B.J. Wootton J.C. Hatfield D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 21Arner E.S. Sarioglu H. Lottspeich F. Holmgren A. Bock A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1003-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In this protein, Sec is the C-terminal penultimate residue; thus, the bacterial-type SECIS could be fused to the 3′ end of the gene without introducing any further change in the ORF. Other strategies were developed to overcome the constraint of engineering SECIS in the ORF. Sec insertion into the polypeptide structure has been achieved by chemical modification of Ser residue (22Ding L. Liu Z. Zhu Z. Luo G. Zhao D. Ni J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Liu J.-Q. Jiang M.-S. Luo G.-M. Yan G.-L. Shen J.-C. Biotechnol. Lett. 1998; 20: 693-696Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or mischarging of tRNACys with Sec when Cys was omitted from the growth medium (24Muller S. Senn H. Gsell B. Vetter W. Baron C. Bock A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3404-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 25Boschi-Muller S. Muller S. Van Dorsselaer A. Bock A. Branlant G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, these strategies do not afford directed substitution, because all Ser or Cys residues along the recombinant protein are subjected to Sec conversion. Consequently, the structure-function characterization of selenoproteins and the potential use of novel engineered selenoenzymes, carrying Sec as a catalytic residue and possessing enhanced biological activity, have been hampered. Here we report for the first time the successful heterologous expression in E. coli of an engineered eukaryotic protein, namely cit-PHGPx, in which the native catalytic Cys residue was replaced by Sec. This substitution conferred enhanced peroxidase activity to the recombinant enzyme. This study clearly demonstrates the ability to engineer and express eukaryotic selenoproteins in bacteria, which is of interest for the biochemical study of this class of proteins and for the design of novel selenoproteins. E. coli strains DH10B and DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used as host for the cloning and expression experiments throughout this study. Plasmid pBluescript SK− (Stratagene) was used as the cloning vector for mutagenesis and expression experiments. E. coli cells were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml of ampicillin and 5 μm sodium selenite (Sigma). Higher concentration of sodium selenite (20 μm) was suspected to be toxic because reddish bacterial pellets were obtained after centrifugation. All recombinant DNA manipulations were carried out by standard procedures. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs and from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) was used for PCR amplification. We generated a series of mutated csagenes carrying different mRNA SECIS motifs. The mutagenesis was done by means of PCR technique. The pARO1 plasmid (26Holland D. Faltin Z. Perl A. Ben-Hayyim G. Eshdat Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 52-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which carries the csa gene encoding the cit-PHGPx protein, served as a template. The strategy for the csa mutagenesis is presented in Fig. 1. The required mutations were introduced into the csa gene using the appropriate primers during PCR amplification (Fig. 1 A). SECIS elements were encoded by two groups of primers designated as prTGT or prTGA, and prST1, prST1b, or prST2. The prTGT and prTGA primers possessed the anticodon encoding the catalytic residue of cit-PHGPx variants (amino acid at location 41 in the native enzyme), either Cys or Sec, respectively. The prST1, prST1b, and prST2 primers encoded the mRNA stem-loop of the corresponding SECIS motif ST1,ST1b, and ST2 (Fig. 1 B). The prST+ and prST− primers were hybridized to the ColE1 origin and contained the AlwNI restriction site. PCR fragments, resulting from amplification of the sequence lying between prST+ and prTGT or prTGA on one hand and between prST− and prST1, prST1b, or prST2 on the other hand were purified on agarose gel. The first fragment was then restricted withAlwNI and HpaI enzymes, whereas the second fragment was restricted with the AlwNI enzyme. After ligation, the resulting plasmid was transformed into competent cells. The mutated csa sequences were verified by DNA sequence analysis. The synthetic selC gene was constructed as described previously (27Normanly J. Masson J.M. Kleina L.G. Abelson J. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6548-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 28Chen G.T. Axley M.J. Hacia J. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The entire tRNASec coding region (14Leinfelder W. Zehelein E. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Bock A. Nature. 1988; 331: 723-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) was synthesized by annealing five complementary oligonucleotides, as shown in Fig. 2. This synthetic gene, containing an EcoRI restriction site at the 5′ end and aPstI restriction site at the 3′ end, was inserted into the unique EcoRI and PstI sites of pSU18 plasmid (29Martinez E. Bartolome B. de la Cruz F. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 68: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In the resulting construct, the synthetic selC gene is located downstream the lacZ promoter. This plasmid was then restricted with FspI and SgrAI enzymes, and the resulting fragment was inserted into the unique NgoMIV andBsaAI restriction sites of the pARO1 plasmid. Purification and enzymatic characterization of the modified cit-PHGPx were performed using bacteria overexpressing selC gene (see below). Bacteria (5 ml,A 600 = 3) were centrifuged, the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmEDTA, and 1 mm AEBSF, pH 7.5, frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed three times. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 20 min). Total protein concentration was determined according to Bradford using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Soluble protein samples (10 μg/well) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining or by Western blotting using anti-cit-PHGPx antibodies, peroxidase-conjugated second antibody, and ECL as substrate (7Ben-Hayyim G. Faltin Z. Gepstein S. Camoin L. Strosberg A.D. Eshdat Y. Plant Sci. 1993; 88: 129-140Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Estimation of the relative amounts of protein in bands of interest was obtained by densitometry, using TINA 2.07d software. The recombinant proteins were purified by reverse-phase HPLC using an Aquapore BU-300 column (100 × 2.1 mm). Lyophilized crude extract from E. coli was diluted up to 1 ml with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solution A) and was centrifuged at 1400 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was immediately applied on the Aquapore column prewashed with solution A. Elution was performed for 92 min at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min by applying a linear gradient starting from solution A up to 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid in 70% acetonitrile, using a Waters 625 LC System. Absorbance between 200 and 300 nm was monitored during the chromatography using Waters 991 Photodiode array detector. Fractions were collected manually and frozen immediately after their elution from the column and kept at −20 °C. Protein samples were dissolved in water:methanol:formic acid (50:50:5) and were introduced to API 365 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer-Sciex, Thornill, Canada) with a syringe pump (5 μl/min; Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA). The device was equipped with an atmospheric pressure ion source, used for sampling positive ions produced from a pneumatically assisted electrospray interface. The ion spray probe tip was held at 4.5 kV, and the orifice voltage was set at 130 V. The mass spectrometer was scanned continuously from m/z 800 to 1700, with a scan step of 0.1 and a dwell time/step of 2.0 ms, resulting in scan duration of 22 s. Ten scans were averaged for each analysis. Mass calibration of the instrument was accomplished by matching ions of polypropylene glycol to known reference masses stored in the mass calibration table of the mass spectrometer. Data was collected on a Power Macintosh 8600/200 and processed through the Biotoolbox 2.3 software obtained from Sciex. Pellets, corresponding to 50-ml cultures of transformed bacteria, were resuspended in 500 μl of buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm AEBSF, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and thawed three times. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. PHGPx activity was measured at room temperature (30Beeor-Tzahar T. Ben-Hayyim G. Holland D. Faltin Z. Eshdat Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) based on the assay described by Maiorino et al. (5Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Ursini F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The assay mixture (total volume, 1 ml) contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 5 mm EDTA, 15 mm glutathione, 0.15 mmNADPH, 3 units of glutathione reductase, and 250 μg of total protein sample. After 5 min of preincubation, phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide was added to give a final concentration of 20 μm, and the rate of the change in the absorbance at 340 nm was monitored, as compared with the absorbance change of the same assay mixture in the absence of phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide. Specific activity of Cys-containing cit-PHGPx proteins was calculated as the ratio between the total PHGPx activity measured in crude extracts and the amount of the enzyme actually synthesized, as estimated by the densitometry analysis. Specific activity of cit-PHGPx variants was expressed as a percentage of native cit-PHGPx specific activity. The relative specific activity of the ST2Secprotein versus ST2Cys was calculated as the ratio between the total PHGPx activity measured in crude extracts, and the amount of enzyme that was determined by Western blot analysis. Nontransformed E. coli cells do not exhibit any endogenous PHGPx-like activity. We aimed at introducing in thecsa ORF variants of the fdhF SECIS (Fig.3 A, panel a) (18Zinoni F. Heider J. Bock A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4660-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), which would afford Sec incorporation into the recombinant cit-PHGPx while preserving the enzymatic activity. The constructs were generated taking into consideration three essential requirements (31Heider J. Baron C. Bock A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3759-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 32Liu Z. Reches M. Groisman I. Engelberg-Kulka H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 896-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar): (i) the eight nucleotides defining the fdhF loop domain should be kept unchanged; (ii) base pairing on the fdhF bulge domain should be preserved and the bulged U17 remain invariant; and (iii), the length of the intermediary domain should comprise 11–14 nucleotides (Fig. 3 A). Accordingly, two SECIS variants called ST1 andST2 were designed (Fig. 3 A, panels band d). As compared with the fdhF SECIS, we particularly altered the bulge domain of ST1 stem-loop by attempting to do conservative substitutions like Tyr48 → Phe or Thr49 → Ser to preserve the cit-PHGPx activity (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the bulge domain of theST2 motif was more preserved so as to ensure its stability and its recognition by the translation machinery. Moreover, to shorten the length of the intermediary domain to 14 nucleotides, we deleted in both SECIS variants the three nucleotides encoding the residue Ser46 in cit-PHGPx. This deletion and the mutation of the flanking Asn45 and Asn47 to Gly and Gln, respectively, are based on the protein sequence of the human pGPx (33Chu F.F. Esworthy R.S. Doroshow J.H. Doan K. Liu X.F. Blood. 1992; 79: 3233-3238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where a one-residue deletion appears at position 46 as compared with other GPxSec (Fig. 3 B). The genes encoding ST1Cys and ST2Cys proteins contained theST1 and ST2 SECIS motifs, respectively, and still possessed a UGU codon for Cys41 as the catalytic residue. The genes encoding ST1Sec and ST2Sec carried a UGA opal codon that aimed to direct Sec incorporation at position 41 and not termination of the polypeptide synthesis (Fig.3 B). At first, ST1Cys and ST2Cys mutants were characterized to determine whether the SECIS mutagenesis affected cit-PHGPx biochemical properties. As shown in Fig. 4, ST1Cys and ST2Cys proteins (lanes 3 and 4) were visualized by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and were found to migrate slightly faster than cit-PHGPx (lane 2). We evaluated by densitometry analysis that the bands assigned to ST1Cys and ST2Cys presented intensity corresponding approximately to 75 and 113% of that of cit-PHGPx, respectively (Table I).Table IPeroxidase activity of Cys-containing cit-PHGPx variants towards phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxidecit-PHGPx variantsPHGPx activity1-aEnzymatic activity was measured in crude extract prepared from E. coli grown in LB medium.

Open table in a new tab Values are given as the means ± S.E. of at least four independent measurements. Determination of the enzymatic activities of the different protein preparations (Table I) revealed that the ST1Cys mutant displayed a specific activity attaining 62.5% of that of the cit-PHGPx, whereas the ST2Cys mutant exhibited a specific activity corresponding to 72% of that of cit-PHGPx. Therefore, despite the introduction of SECIS motifs that led to seven amino acids replacements in the primary sequence of cit-PHGPx (Fig. 3 B), most of the peroxidase activity was preserved in the Cys-containing variants. To examine Sec incorporation into the ST1Sec and ST2Secpolypeptides, bacteria expressing the engineered cit-PHGPx were grown in LB medium complemented or not with 5 μm sodium selenite. Protein extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5, the addition of selenium to the growth medium enabled the synthesis of ST1Sec and ST2Sec (lanes 3 and5), whose apparent molecular weight was identical to that of ST1Cys and ST2Cys. The yield of ST2Sec was higher than that of ST1Sec. Therefore, suppression of the termination codon was more efficient for the ST2Sec mutant than for ST1Sec, correlating with the fact that ST2 stem-loop resembled more closely thefdhF SECIS than the ST1 motif (Fig.3 A). Nevertheless, the amount of Sec-containing cit-PHGPx appeared to be much lower than that of the native cit-PHGPx under the same conditions (Fig. 5, lanes 1, 3, and5). In an attempt to increase ST1Sec expression, we designed the ST1b SECIS, in which A17 and U35are base paired (Fig. 3 A, panel c). The compensatory mutation A35 → T35 was expected to improve the stability of the ST1 stem-loop. However, as shown in Fig. 5 (lane 4), the SDS-PAGE analysis did not reveal any production of ST1bSec protein, demonstrating that the substitution A35 → T35 led to the complete abolition of Sec incorporation. To examine the effect of tRNASec concentration on the level of cit-PHGPxSec expression, a synthetic selC gene was inserted into the plasmids coding for the cit-PHGPx variants (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 5 (lane 6), the overexpression of tRNASec led to a significant increase of the ST2Sec production; a similar result was obtained for ST1Sec as well (data not shown). After quantitative determination of immunoblot bands, the estimated amount of ST2Sec protein in crude extract was about 8-fold lower than that of the ST2Cys protein (Fig.6). Overexpression of tRNASecalso enhanced the synthesis of a cit-PHGPx protein in the absence of selenium complementation (Fig. 5, lane 6). We assumed that such level of synthesis was due to selenium traces, which are certainly present in LB medium (see “Discussion”). Recombinant cit-PHGPx and its ST2Cys and ST2Sec mutants were partially purified from soluble fraction of bacterial extract using one-step HPLC. All three proteins were eluted after 56 min and gave very distinct peaks (Fig. 7 A). ST2Cys was purified almost to homogeneity (Fig.7 B, lane 2), whereas ST2Sec, whose amount in crude extract is substantially lower than that of ST2Cys, was estimated to be 50% pure (Fig. 7 B,lane 1). Using an integration procedure that measures the peak absorbance in comparison with a quantified cit-PHGPx standard, it was estimated that ST2Cys and ST2Secpurification yielded about 2.30 and 0.23 mg of protein, respectively, per liter of culture. These amounts are in agreement with the relative concentration of ST2Sec versusST2Cys previously calculated (Fig. 6). The fractions containing either ST2Cys or ST2Sec, obtained by the HPLC procedure (Fig. 7), did not exhibit any catalytic activity, probably because of denaturation of the protein during the purification procedure. They were used, however, to establish the chemical composition of the amino acid 41 of ST2Cys and ST2Sec by mass spectrometry. The HPLC fractions corresponding to ST2Sec and ST2Cys were analyzed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 8). A major peak representing a mass of 18258 was obtained for the purified ST2Cys, corresponding to the predicted mass of cit-PHGPx variant containing Cys41. As for ST2Sec, a major peak corresponding to a mass of 18,305 was obtained. The mass difference of 47 between ST2Cys and ST2Secpeaks, corresponding to the atomic weight difference between selenium and sulfur, clearly demonstrated Sec incorporation into the ST2Sec enzyme. Moreover, ST2Sec profile did not reveal any other peak corresponding to the incorporation at position 41 of an amino acid other than Sec. Therefore, the ST2Secprotein synthesized by bacteria grown in selenium-supplemented medium was exclusively a Sec-containing enzyme. The PHGPx activity exhibited by the soluble fractions of E. coli expressing cit-PHGPx variants was determined. It appeared that the Sec-containing cit-PHGPx was actually capable of catalyzing the reduction of phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide (Fig.9). Under conditions of selenium deficiency in LB medium, a total PHGPx activity of 0.6 and 0.7 unit was measured in the crude extracts obtained from bacteria expressing ST1Sec and ST2Sec, respectively (Fig. 9). When growth medium was supplemented with 5 μm sodium selenite, PHGPx activity from bacteria expressing ST1Sec and ST2Secincreased significantly, attaining 3.2 and 6 units, respectively, confirming that selenium complementation induced cit-PHGPxSec synthesis as shown in Fig. 5. Protein extracts from bacteria expressing ST2Sec and ST2Cys, used for the measurements of PHGPx activity (Fig. 9), were subjected to Western blot analysis as shown in Fig. 6. Considering that bacteria synthesizing ST2Sec displayed a total activity 2 ± 0.7-fold lower than that of bacteria expressing ST2Cys, whereas the corresponding amount of ST2Sec was 8.2 ± 0.6-fold lower than that of ST2Cys (Fig. 6), the specific activity of the ST2Sec peroxidase was estimated to be 4 ± 1.3-fold higher than that of the ST2Cysenzyme. In contrast to the simplicity of substituting Cys for Sec in selenoproteins via simple point mutagenesis (TGA to TGT), the reverse mutation, i.e. from Cys to Sec, is not straightforward because a point mutation from TGT to TGA will introduce a STOP codon, which normally terminates protein translation. In E. coli, TGA is decoded as a sense codon for Sec only if a bacterial-type SECIS element is located immediately downstream the TGA codon (2Stadtman T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 13Baron C. Bock A. Soll D. RhajBhandary U. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1995: 529-544Google Scholar). In the present study, we aimed at substituting Sec for the catalytic Cys41 residue of cit-PHGPx, and to produce, in prokaryotic cells, a recombinant Sec-containing eukaryotic glutathione peroxidase. The major obstacle to such engineering lies in the fact that introduction of SECIS within the csa ORF should result in alteration of the cit-PHGPx amino acid sequence and may affect its function. Accordingly, on the basis of the bacterial fdhFSECIS, we attempted to engineer two SECIS-like motifs, designated asST1 and ST2, within the csa ORF, in a way that minimized the number of amino acid substitutions in cit-PHGPx (Fig. 3). We initially characterized the ST1Cys and ST2Cys proteins whose mRNA possessed an engineered SECIS motif but still contained a UGU codon encoding the catalytic Cys41. ST1Cys and ST2Cys displayed specific activity attaining 62.5 and 72% of that of cit-PHGPx, respectively (Table I), demonstrating that cit-PHGPx biosynthesis and most of its catalytic activity were preserved despite the structural modifications induced by the SECIS mutagenesis. Such result was probably due to the fact that the amino acid substitutions were designed in a rather poorly conserved domain of the PHGPx family (Fig.3 B). We then examined whether the engineered SECIS were able to direct Sec incorporation. The UGA codon inserted in the cit-PHGPx reading frame, in addition to the stem-loop, was recognized as a sense codon, because full-sized ST1Sec and ST2Sec proteins were synthesized (Fig. 5). Moreover, this synthesis was dependent upon the addition of selenium to the growth medium. This evidence for Sec incorporation into ST1Sec and ST2Sec was conclusively confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis of the purified ST2Sec protein (Fig. 8). Thus, despite drastic mutations in the bulge domain, especially for the ST1 SECIS in which six of the eight native nucleotides were changed (Fig. 3), the altered SECIS still afforded Sec incorporation, showing that a particular array of nucleotides in the bulge domain is not essential for function and may be modified. In addition to these nucleotide substitutions, the intermediary domain between the Sec codon and the stem-loop was three nucleotides longer than that of the bacterial fdhF SECIS. This additional codon probably led to a substantial decrease in the efficiency of Sec incorporation, as suggested in previous works done on the native fdhF SECIS (31Heider J. Baron C. Bock A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3759-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 32Liu Z. Reches M. Groisman I. Engelberg-Kulka H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 896-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We attempted to obtain a higher amount of ST1Sec protein by substituting A35 by U to establish the base pairing A17-U35. Because the base A35 was not described as belonging to the minimal SECIS motif allowing Sec incorporation (32Liu Z. Reches M. Groisman I. Engelberg-Kulka H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 896-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we expected that this complementary mutation could improve the stability of the mRNA stem-loop and consequently, enhance the UGA-directed Sec incorporation. However, Sec incorporation was abolished by this single mutation (Fig. 5), suggesting that the base A35, which is, in fact, conserved among all the SECIS identified in fdh genes from E. coli,Enterobacter aerogenes, and Hemeophilus influenzae (34Wilting R. Vamvakidou K. Bock A. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 169: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), plays a critical role and therefore should be added to the minimal SECIS requirements. By overexpressing tRNASec (28Chen G.T. Axley M.J. Hacia J. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 35Tormay P. Sawers A. Bock A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the selenoprotein production was significantly increased, thus providing additional evidence that ST1Sec and ST2Sec expression was actually governed by the Sec incorporation mechanism. Probably because of the presence of selenium traces in LB medium, tRNASecoverexpression also enhanced the expression of a cit-PHGPX protein when sodium selenite was not added to the growth medium. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that this synthesis was also due to an additional read-through mechanism resulting in Trp incorporation. Indeed, it has been recently shown that the presence of a G nucleotide adjacent to the UGA on its 3′ side in the fdhF SECIS, as found in the ST1 and ST2 motifs as well (Fig.3 A), promotes Trp-inserting opal suppression when selenium is omitted (36Liu Z. Reches M. Engelberg-Kulka H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1073-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 37Sandman K.E. Noren C.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the fact that mass spectrometry analysis of ST2Sec showed no indication for incorporation at position 41 of an amino acid other than Sec (Fig. 8), suggests that when bacteria were grown in sodium selenite-supplemented medium, Sec incorporation pathway was greatly favored. Substitution of native Sec by Cys in mouse cellular GPxSec(38Rocher C. Lalanne J.L. Chaudiere J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and in pig heart PHGPxSec (9Maiorino M. Aumann K.D. Brigelius-Flohe R. Doria D. van den Heuvel J. McCarthy J. Roveri A. Ursini F. Flohe L. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) led to a dramatic reduction of the enzymatic activity, about 1000- and 250-fold, respectively. Consistently, the naturally Cys-containing cit-PHGPx displays catalytic activity of only 0.2% of that of the pig heart PHGPxSec (10Eshdat Y. Holland D. Faltin Z. Ben-Hayyim G. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 234-240Crossref Google Scholar). If the relatively low activity of cit-PHGPx is only due to the presence of a catalytic Cys instead of Sec, a superactive cit-PHGPx could possibly be generated just by replacing the Cys41 residue by Sec. Our results show that the recombinant ST2Sec PHGPx actually exhibited a 4-fold higher specific activity than that of the Cys-containing control analog, ST2Cys. Thus, it appeared that the cit-PHGPxSecvariants possibly do not possess the appropriate physico-chemical and conformational environment that confer to Sec its particularly high contribution to the catalytic efficiency of animal GPxSec. Further investigation on structure-function relationships of GPxSec is therefore required to produce, in bacteria, an improved GPxSec displaying an activity comparable with that of mammalian enzymes. Within this scope, the system developed here is of high potential for performing mutational analysis that is unconceivable in animal cell system and for producing and characterizing other novel selenoproteins as well.

Kapβ2 bound to a region at the N terminus of Nup98 that contains an M9-like sequence. The human ribonucleoprotein A1 M9 sequence competed with Nup98 for binding to Kapβ2, indicating that Nup98 can dissociate Kapβ2 from its substrate. Binding of Kapβ2 to Nup98 was inhibited by Ran loaded with guanylyl imidophosphate, suggesting that RanGTP dissociates Kapβ2 from Nup98. RanGTP is produced from RanGDP through nucleotide exchange mediated by RanGEF (RCC1). Immunoelectron microscopy and nucleotide exchange assays revealed functional RanGEF on both sides of the NPC. On the nuclear side, the localization of RanGEF coincided with that of Nup98. RanGEF bound to Nup98 at a region adjacent to the Kapβ2-binding site. These findings suggest a model where 1) import substrate is released from Kapβ2 at the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC by competition with the Nup98 M9-like site, 2) Nup98-bound RanGEF catalyzes the formation of RanGTP, and 3) RanGTP dissociates Kapβ2 from Nup98 allowing repeated cycles of import.

The vertebrate NPC is a supramolecular structure of 125 million daltons, which is approximately 30 times the size of a ribosome (2Reichelt R. Holzenburg A. Buhle Jr., E.L. Jarnik M. Engel A. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 883-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Each NPC is composed of a central cylinder surrounded by a spoke-ring structure that anchors the cylinder to the nuclear envelope (3Akey C.W. Radermacher M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 4Hinshaw J.E. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 1133-1141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Filaments extending 50–100 nm emanate from this central core into the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm (5Goldberg M.W. Allen T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 848-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 6Cordes V.C. Reidenbach S. Rackwitz H.R. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 515-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). On the nucleoplasmic side, these filaments form a basket-like structure (7Ris H. EMSA Bull. 1991; 21: 54-56Google Scholar). In the mammalian NPC, all these structures together consist of approximately 50 different proteins termed nucleoporins (8Doye V. Hurt E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). A subset of nucleoporins that contain Phe-Gly repeats (FG nucleoporins) constitute docking sites for transport factors at the NPC (9Buss F. Kent H. Stewart M. Bailer S. Hanover J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 631-638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Radu A. Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 81: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 11Katahira J. Strasser K.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Some of these nucleoporins are localized asymmetrically at the NPC. Nup358 and Nup214, for example, are associated with the cytoplasmic filaments, whereas Nup98 and Nup153 are localized at or near the basket on the nucleoplasmic side (10Radu A. Moore M.S. Blobel G.

Cell. 1993; 72: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). On the other hand, p62 appears to be symmetrically localized on both sides close to the midplane of the NPC (17Guan T. Muller S. Klier G. Pante N. Blevitt J.M. Haner M. Paschal B. Aebi U. Gerace L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1591-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 18Hu T. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 589-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The asymmetric distribution of nucleoporins and their different affinities for import and export complexes may be important in determining the directionality of transport. Nup98 contains a number of FG repeats in its N-terminal portion that act as docking sites during import (10Radu A. Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 81: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In addition, Nup98 appears to be involved in multiple RNA export pathways (19Pritchard C.E. Fornerod M. Kasper L.H. van Deursen J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 20Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Dahlberg J.E. Lund E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Nup98 has been described as a frequent target for chromosomal rearrangements in acute leukemia, and its N-terminal FG repeat region is present in all leukemia-associated Nup98 fusions that have been characterized to date (21–32). These findings suggest a link between the function of Nup98 in nuclear transport and its role in leukemogenesis. Nuclear import and export of molecules involve interactions of soluble transport factors with their cargoes and with the NPC. Transport receptors bind import or export signals present in their cargoes and are collectively known as karyopherins (also called importins or exportins). Nuclear import of proteins bearing a classical nuclear localization signal (cNLS) was the first to be characterized at the molecular level. Import of a cNLS-bearing protein is mediated by a heterodimer of karyopherin α (Kapα) and karyopherin β1 (Kapβ1). Kapα interacts directly with the cNLS, whereas Kapβ1 binds to nucleoporins resulting in the docking of the complex to the NPC. Other soluble factors are involved in the translocation process through the NPC, including the small GTPase Ran, p10 (also known as NTF2), and the Ran-binding protein RanBP1 (33Gorlich D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 34Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin.

Other members of the Kapβ family serve as import receptors for other classes of proteins that have non-classical NLSs. In many of these cases the Kapβ binds directly to the NLS of its import cargo rather than through a Kapα-like adapter. For example, hnRNP A1 has an NLS rich in aromatic residues and glycine, called M9, that is directly bound by Kapβ2 (transportin1) resulting in docking of the complex at the NPC and its import into the nucleus (36Bonifaci N. Moroianu J. Radu A. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5055-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 37Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Additional import and export pathways have been identified and are reviewed elsewhere (33Gorlich D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 34Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin.

Ran is a small GTPase that cycles between a GDP-bound form (RanGDP) and a GTP-bound form (RanGTP) and plays an important role in both import and export (38Cole C.N. Hammell C.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R368-R372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22857-22860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 40Rush M.G. Drivas G. D'Eustachio P. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Interconversion of RanGDP and RanGTP is regulated by the Ran GTPase-activating protein RanGAP1 and the Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor RanGEF (also called RCC1). RanGAP1 is localized in the cytosol and at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC and catalyzes nucleotide hydrolysis by RanGTP to form RanGDP (41Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). RanGEF is localized predominantly in the nucleus and catalyzes nucleotide exchange favoring the generation of RanGTP, since the intracellular concentration of GTP is higher than that of GDP (39Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22857-22860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 40Rush M.G. Drivas G. D'Eustachio P.

Clarke P.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2423-2427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the nucleus has a higher concentration of RanGTP than the cytoplasm. Ran appears to be imported primarily in the GDP-bound form, but functional RanGEF is required in order for Ran to accumulate in the nucleus, presumably as RanGTP (45Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which import complexes travel through the NPC and are disassembled in the nucleus are not well understood. The process is thought to involve several steps. Kapβs interact strongly with RanGTP but not with RanGDP. Binding of RanGTP to import Kapβs results in the release of their cargo. Since a higher concentration of RanGTP is predicted in the nucleus, it is thought that this reaction results in the release of cargo from import Kapβs in the nucleus (46Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 47Siomi M.C. Eder P.S. Kataoka N. Wan L. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1181-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 48Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). However, there is evidence that Kapβ2 can deliver its cargo to the nucleus in the absence of Ran when Kapβ2 and the cargo are provided in equimolar concentrations (49Ribbeck K. Kutay U. Paraskeva E. Gorlich D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 47-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus the release of cargo from the nuclear side of the nuclear pore complex may also occur by Ran-independent mechanisms. In this study, we have focused on the role of the nucleoporin Nup98 in the termination of Kapβ2-mediated nuclear import at the nuclear side of the NPC. We show that Kapβ2 binds to the N terminus of Nup98 at a region that contains an hnRNP A1 M9-like sequence. This binding is prevented by an M9-containing protein, indicating that Nup98 binds to the cargo-binding site of Kapβ2. Thus, Nup98 may disassemble the Kapβ2-M9 import complex at the nuclear side of the NPC providing a mechanism for the Ran-independent import by Kapβ2 mentioned above. The resulting Kapβ2-Nup98 complex would need to be disassembled before Kapβ2 can be recycled for further rounds of import. This function is probably performed by RanGTP since our data show that RanGMPPNP inhibits binding of Kapβ2 to Nup98. However, since Ran traverses the NPC on its way to the nucleus primarily in the GDP-bound form (45Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 50Smith A. Brownawell A. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1403-1406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a mechanism is needed for the local production of RanGTP in order to dissociate Kapβ2 from Nup98. RanGEF is the only known nucleotide exchange factor for Ran and is thought to be confined to the inside of the nucleus in association with chromatin (51Ohtsubo M. Okazaki H. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Here we show that RanGEF, in addition to its intranuclear localization, is also associated with the NPC. By using immunoelectron microscopy, we show that RanGEF is present on both the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic sides of the NPC. On the nucleoplasmic side, the localization of RanGEF coincides with the previously determined localization of Nup98 (10Radu A. Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 81: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). By using in vitro nucleotide exchange assays we found that nuclear envelope-associated RanGEF is functional. Consistent with the ultrastructural data, RanGEF indeed bound to Nup98, at the FG repeat region immediately downstream of the Kapβ2-binding site. These data are integrated into a model for the termination of Kapβ2-mediated nuclear import at the nuclear side of the NPC. Wild-type Nup98 precursor was cloned into pAlter-MAX as described previously (52Fontoura B.M. Blobel G. Matunis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1097-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). All truncated mutants were generated by PCR using the wild-type Nup98 precursor as template. An oligonucleotide complementary to the 5′ end of the indicated region for each mutant (see Fig. 3) and containing aSalI site was used in conjunction with an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to sequences at the 3′ end of the indicated regions in Fig. 3 and containing a NotI site. The resulting PCR products were digested with SalI andNotI and ligated into the SalI/NotI sites of myc-pAlter-MAX. The human NUP98 open reading frame was amplified by PCR from a bone marrow cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and subcloned into theBamHI and SalI sites of pGEX4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to produce a GST-Nup98 fusion. The GST-Nup98 fusion protein was purified from bacterial lysate by binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The human KAPβ2 gene subcloned into pGEX4T3 containing a Tev protease cleavage site, and the maltose-binding protein fused with M3 (MBP-M3) was a kind gift from Yuh-Min Chook (53Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of GST-Kapβ2 was performed as originally described (53Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The maltose-binding protein (MBP) was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The humanRANGEF open reading frame was amplified by PCR from a bone marrow cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and subcloned into the BamHI and SalI sites of pGEX4T3 to produce a GST-RanGEF fusion. The GST-RanGEF fusion protein was purified from bacterial lysate by binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads and either kept immobilized on the beads or eluted by thrombin cleavage. Human recombinant Ran protein loaded with either GDP or GMPPNP was a kind gift from Yuh-Min Chook (53Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). All wild-type and Nup98 mutant proteins were in vitro transcribed and translated using a coupled reticulocyte lysate transcription/translation system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), in the presence of [35S]methionine, according to manufacturer's instructions. Binding reactions were carried out as described (54Yaseen N.R. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26493-26502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) using 10 μl (unless otherwise indicated) of in vitro transcribed and translated proteins as indicated in the figure legends. Bound and unbound fractions were separated on SDS-PAGE, and the gels were analyzed by autoradiography. Binding reactions with bacterially expressed recombinant proteins were carried out as described previously (54Yaseen N.R. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26493-26502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Rat liver nuclei were isolated as described (55Blobel G. Potter V.R. Science. 1966; 154: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar) and stored frozen at −80 °C in 100-unit aliquots (1 unit = 3 × 106 nuclei). Nuclear envelopes were prepared by a modification of the procedure described by Dwyer and Blobel (56Dwyer N. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 70: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Nuclei were thawed and pelleted at 500 rpm in a tabletop microcentrifuge for 1 min. After removing the supernatant, the pellet was resuspended to a final concentration of 100 units/ml by dropwise addition of cold buffer A, 0.1 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 18 μg/ml aprotinin), 5 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma), and 5 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma) with constant vortexing. The nuclei were then immediately diluted to 20 units/ml by addition of ice-cold buffer B, 10% sucrose, 20 mmtriethanolamine (pH 8.5), 0.1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and protease inhibitors, again with constant vortexing. Following a 15-min incubation on ice, the suspension was underlaid with 5 ml of ice-cold buffer C, 30% sucrose, 20 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.5), 0.1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors, and centrifuged at 4,100 × g in a swinging bucket rotor (Sorvall type HB-4) for 15 min at 4 °C. After removing the supernatant and sucrose cushion, the pellet was resuspended to a final concentration of 100 units/ml in ice cold buffer D, 10% sucrose, 20 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.5), 0.1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors. The suspension was immediately underlaid with 5 ml of buffer C and pelleted as above. The pellet resulting from this second extraction is operationally defined as the nuclear envelope fraction. Isolated nuclear envelopes were fixed for 15 min in 2.5% formaldehyde in STM (10% sucrose, 20 mm triethanolamine HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mmMgCl2) and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min onto 35-mm tissue culture dishes. The pelleted nuclear envelopes were washed three times with 1% BSA, 68 mm NaCl, 13 mm KCl, 15 mm KH2PO4, 40 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and incubated with two goat polyclonal anti-RanGEF antibodies, RCC1(N-19) and RCC1(C-20), diluted 1:10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bound antibodies were detected with rabbit anti-goat IgG conjugated with 5-nm gold (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) diluted 1:50. Recombinant human Ran was prepared and loaded with [α-32P]GTP as described (57Floer M. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5313-5316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Exchange reactions were carried out at room temperature for 30 min in 300 μl of STM in the presence of 1 mm GDP. The reactions were stopped by adding 300 μl of cold transport buffer with 1 mm DTT and 1 mg/ml BSA on ice and applied onto BA85 filters (Schleicher & Schuell) by vacuum aspiration. The filters were washed with 5 ml of cold transport buffer, 1 mm DTT, 1 mg/ml BSA and allowed to dry before scintillation counting. We have previously shown that Nup98 is synthesized as a precursor derived from at least two alternatively spliced mRNAs (52Fontoura B.M. Blobel G. Matunis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1097-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The Nup98 precursor is cleaved at the C terminus, generating Nup98 (residues 1–863) and a 6-kDa C-terminal fragment (residues 864–920), and the Nup98-Nup96 precursor is cleaved at the same site generating Nup98 (residues 1–863) and Nup96-(residues 864–1712) (52Fontoura B.M. Blobel G. Matunis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1097-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Nup98 can be divided into two domains (Fig.1 A). The N-terminal half contains the FG-containing repeat domain (residues 1–497), and the second half of the molecule contains the highly conserved cleavage site domain.Figure 1Nup98 and Nup153 contain sequences similar to hnRNPA1 M9.

Using the Clustal method, the M9 sequence of hnRNP A1 and the M9-like sequence of Nup98 are approximately 30% identical and 56% similar (Fig. 1 B). No other sequence similarity was observed between Nup98 and hnRNP A1. An M9-like sequence has previously been reported on Nup153 (58Nakielny S. Shaikh S. Burke B. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1982-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This sequence has approximately 20% identity and 47% similarity to that of hnRNP A1 M9 (Fig. 1 B) and is a site for Kapβ2 binding (58Nakielny S. Shaikh S. Burke B. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1982-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Previous evidence from overlay assays suggests that Nup98 also binds to Kapβ2 (36Bonifaci N. Moroianu J. Radu A. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5055-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To determine whether the M9-like sequence in Nup98 is indeed a Kapβ2-binding site,in vitro binding assays were performed using bacterially expressed recombinant Kapβ2. Full-length Nup98 could be expressed in soluble form either with a GST tag in bacteria (rGST-Nup98) or in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitrotranscription/translation system (ivNup98). With purified rGST-Nup98 a direct interaction between Nup98 and Kapβ2 could be demonstrated (see below). However, as some of the truncated Nup98 mutants were insoluble when expressed in bacteria (data not shown), a rabbit reticulocytein vitro transcription and translation system was used to map the Kapβ2-binding site on Nup98. GST-tagged recombinant Kapβ2 was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, incubated with ivNup98, and the bound and unbound fractions were visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig.2 A). In vitrotranscribed/translated Nup96 and luciferase were used as controls. Nup98 bound to GST-Kapβ2, whereas Nup96 and luciferase showed no significant binding (Fig. 2 A). The observed binding of Nup98 to Kapβ2 could be either direct or it could be indirect,i.e. mediated by one or more of the numerous proteins present in the reticulocyte lysate. To determine whether the binding is direct, rGST-Nup98 was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with recombinant Kapβ2. Kapβ2 bound to rGST-Nup98 (Fig.2 B) showing that the two proteins interact directly. As a control, Kapβ2 was incubated with GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads to show that Kapβ2 does not interact with GST moiety (Fig. 2 B). We conclude that the binding of Kapβ2 to Nup98 is both specific and direct. To map the Kapβ2-binding site on Nup98, a series of Nup98 truncation mutants were constructed and expressed in the reticulocyte lysate system. These truncation mutants were then incubated with immobilized GST-Kapβ2 (Fig. 3). Amino acids 1–316 were shown to constitute the necessary region for binding of Nup98 to Kapβ2. As mentioned above (see Fig. 1), this region contains the M9-like sequence (amino acids 25–60) as well as FG repeats. Thus, Kapβ2 binds to the FG-containing repeat region of Nup98, a region that includes and extends beyond the M9-like sequence. The presence of an M9-like sequence in Nup98 led us to investigate whether Nup98 would compete with M9 for binding to Kapβ2. The M9 sequence of hnRNP A1 is contained within a larger sequence, called M3 (Fig.1 A), that appears to bind to Kapβ2 more efficiently (37Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The M3 fragment was expressed in bacteria as a fusion protein with MBP and used in the competition studies. In vitro binding assays were performed with immobilized GST-Kapβ2 and in vitroexpressed Nup98 in the absence or presence of either MBP or MBP fused to M3 (Fig. 4). Most of the binding of Nup98 to Kapβ2 was abolished in the presence of MBP-M3 but not in the presence of MBP alone (Fig. 4). These results indicate that Nup98 is able to compete for the substrate-binding site on Kapβ2. Thus, when Kapβ2 with its bound cargo reaches the nuclear side of the NPC, Nup98 might release the cargo. In order to complete the import cycle, Kapβ2 would then need to be released from Nup98. Since Ran is known to regulate the assembly and disassembly of nuclear transport complexes, we sought to determine the effect of Ran on the binding of Kapβ2 to Nup98. In vitro binding assays were performed with immobilized GST-Kapβ2 and in vitro expressed Nup98 in the absence or presence of Ran loaded with either GDP or GMPPNP (a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue). As shown in Fig. 5, RanGMPPNP inhibited the binding of Kapβ2 to Nup98, whereas RanGDP had no such effect. These results indicate that RanGTP could dissociate Kapβ2 from Nup98 at the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC. Thus, during import, the Kapβ2-substrate complex could be dissociated by binding of Kapβ2 to the M9-like sequence of Nup98, leading to the release of substrate. The next step would be to dissociate Kapβ2 from Nup98, which can be accomplished by RanGTP. However, Ran is imported through the NPC primarily in its GDP-bound form, and conversion of RanGDP to RanGTP can only be accomplished by RanGEF (45Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 50Smith A. Brownawell A. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1403-1406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RanGEF is known to be present in the nuclear interior in association with chromatin (51Ohtsubo M. Okazaki H. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) but has not been shown in association with the NPC. It was therefore of interest to determine whether RanGEF is also found at the NPC where it would catalyze the conversion of RanGDP to RanGTP in order to release Kapβ2 from Nup98. Isolated rat liver nuclear envelopes were probed with antibodies to RanGEF followed by secondary gold-conjugated antibody. RanGEF was found associated with both sides of the NPC (Fig. 6 A). On the cytoplasmic side, the distribution of gold particles gave a mean distance of 42.9 nm from the midplane of the nuclear envelope (n = 171). On the nucleoplasmic side, the mean distance was 39.6 nm (n = 164) (Fig. 6 B). Interestingly, the localization of RanGEF at the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC coincides with the previously determined localization of Nup98"

We have investigated the structure-activity relationships of CgA using fibroblasts and coronary artery smooth muscle cells in adhesion assays. A recombinant CgA fragment 1–78 and a peptide 7–57 containing reduced and alkylated cysteines (Cys17 and Cys38) induced cell adhesion after adsorption onto solid phases at 50–100 nm. Peptides lacking the disulfide loop region, including residues 47–68, 39–59, and 39–68, induced cell adhesion, either bound to solid phases at 200–400 nmor added to the liquid phase at 5–10 μm, whereas peptide 60–68 was inactive, suggesting that residues 47–57 are important for activity. The effect of CgA-(1–78) was blocked by anti-CgA antibodies against epitopes including residues Arg53, His54, and Leu57. Substitutions of residues His54, Gln55, and Asn56 with alanine decreased the cell adhesion activity of peptide 47–68. These results suggest that the region 47–57 (RILSILRHQNL) contains a cell adhesion site and that the disulfide bridge is not necessary for the proadhesive activity. The ability of soluble peptides to elicit proadhesive effects suggests an indirect mechanism. The high sequence conservation and accessibility to antibodies suggest that this region is important for the physiological role of CgA.

It is concentrated and stored within secretory granules and is released in the extracellular environment together with the co-resident hormones after an appropriate stimulus. Human CgA is a polypeptide of 439 amino acids that may form dimers or tetramers depending on pH and Ca2+ concentration (6Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol.

Tissue-specific patterns of proteolytic processing and formation of different fragments have been observed by many investigators (10Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D.

N-terminal fragments of CgA may also form dimers that can rapidly dissociate to monomers upon dilution (14Corti A. Sanchez L.P. Gasparri A. Flavio C. Longhi R. Brandazza A. Siccardi A. Sidoli A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The intracellular and extracellular functions of CgA and its proteolytic fragments are still unclear. It is believed that CgA is involved in hormone packaging and in modulating the secretory granule functions by buffering hydrogen ions and binding Ca2+, ATP, and co-resident hormones (15Deftos L.J. Endocr. Rev. 1991; 12: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been proposed that CgA is a precursor of biologically active peptides with endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine functions. For instance, CgA residues 248–293 were found to be homologous to pancreastatin, a pancreatic peptide that inhibits insulin secretion (16Tatemoto K. Efendic S. Mutt V. Makk G. Feistner G.J. Barchas J.D. Nature. 1986; 324: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), whereas catestatin, a peptide corresponding to residues 344–364 of bovine CgA, inhibits secretion of catecholamines from chromaffin cells and noradrenergic neurites (17Mahata S.K.

In the attempt to identify the molecular determinants of CgA cell adhesion activity, we have investigated the structure-activity relationships of vasostatin-1 using several recombinant and synthetic peptides and anti-CgA antibodies. We show that the region 47–57 of CgA N-terminal fragments contains an accessible site that induces adhesion and spreading of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells on solid phases. Mouse anti-CgA monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 4D5, 7D1, 5A8, 5B12, B4E11, and A11 were described previously (14Corti A. Sanchez L.P. Gasparri A. Flavio C. Longhi R. Brandazza A. Siccardi A. Sidoli A.

Blasi, San Raffaele H Scientific Institute, Milan) were cultured in T80 flasks (Nunc, Roskild, Denmark, catalog no. 178891) using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (catalog no. 12-604F, BioWhittaker Italia) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (DMEM-GPS), and 10% FBS (DMEM-GPSF), at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The cell line was routinely checked for mycoplasma contamination. Human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMC; obtained from Clonetics-BioWhittaker Italia) were cultured in smooth muscle cell basal medium, 5% FBS, 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor, 5 μg/ml insulin, 1 ng/ml human foreskin fibroblast growth factor, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 50 ng/ml amphotericin B (smooth muscle cell basal medium-FBS). All cell culture reagents were from Clonetics-BioWhittaker Italia. Recombinant human CgA-(1–439) and CgA-(7–439) were described previously (24Gasparri A. Sidoli A. Sanchez L.P. Longhi R.

Recombinant NH2-Ser-Thr-Ala-CgA-(1–78), hereafter termed (STA)1–78, was obtained by expression in Escherichia colicells (14Corti A. Sanchez L.P. Gasparri A. Flavio C. Longhi R. Brandazza A. Siccardi A. Sidoli A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cell extract was boiled for 15 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g (20 min). (STA)1–78 was purified from the supernatant by reverse-phase HPLC using a SOURCE 15 RPC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (14Corti A. Sanchez L.P. Gasparri A. Flavio C. Longhi R. Brandazza A. Siccardi A. Sidoli A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), followed by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S-200 HR column, pre-equilibrated and eluted with 0.9% sodium chloride. 12 mg of purified protein, by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), was recovered from 1 liter of culture. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the product showed a single band of about 9 kDa under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Endotoxin content was 0.008–0.016 units/μg by the Lymulus Amoebocyte Lysate Pyrotest (Difco). Recombinant NH2-Ser-Thr-Ala-CgA-(1–48) ((STA)1–48) was prepared as follows. The plasmid pET12a/VS-2 (14Corti A. Sanchez L.P. Gasparri A. Flavio C. Longhi R. Brandazza A. Siccardi A. Sidoli A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), containing the sequence coding for (STA)1–115, was digested with BamHI. The fragment obtained, coding for (STA)1–46, was ligated with the palindromic adapter 5′-G ATC TAA TGA GTC GAC TCA TTA-3′ to insert the codons for residues 47 and 48, two stop codons, and a SalI site. The plasmid obtained, named pET12a/CgA1–48, was used for periplasmic expression of (STA)1–48 in E. coli cells. The product was purified by reverse-phase chromatography as described for (STA)1–78 (14Corti A. Sanchez L.P. Gasparri A. Flavio C. Longhi R. Brandazza A. Siccardi A. Sidoli A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Since the purified (STA)1–48 still contained disulfide-aggregated material, as indicated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis under reducing and nonreducing conditions, the product was reduced with β-mercaptoethanol (50 mm in 0.15 m sodium chloride, 0.05m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3 (PBS), 30 min on ice) and dialyzed against PBS. The product was then mixed with oxidizedl-glutathione (0.065 mg/ml, final concentration) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The refolded material was purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a Protein C4 column (1 × 25 cm) (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) as follows: buffer A, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, 3% acetonitrile in water; buffer B, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 80% acetonitrile in water; 0% B for 4 min; linear gradient 14 to 60% B in 26 min; 100% B for 4 min (flow rate, 9 ml/min). Fractions containing immunoreactive material, by ELISA, and corresponding to a 6-kDa monomeric protein by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were pooled and lyophilized. Part of the product, reconstituted with water, was hydrolyzed with 6m hydrochloric acid (24 h at 110 °C) and analyzed using an amino acid analyzer. The amino acid composition of (STA)1–48 was in good agreement with that expected (not shown). The protein content was calculated from the amount of recovered amino acids and expected amino acid compositions. Various peptides spanning most of the CgA sequence were prepared manually by chemical synthesis as described previously (26Corti A. Longhi R. Gasparri A. Chen F. Pelagi M. Siccardi A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Each product was purified by reverse-phase chromatography. The peptide (Y)7–57SS was synthesized using an Applied Biosystems model 433A peptide synthesizer. This peptide, containing two cysteines, was oxidized by overnight incubation with a 5-fold excess of oxidized glutathione (28Ferrer M. Woodward C. Barany G. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 194-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and purified by ion exchange and reverse-phase chromatography. The peptide 7–57SEtM, corresponding to CgA-(7–57) with alkylated Cys17 and Cys38, was prepared as follows. A peptide encompassing the region 7–57 was synthesized, as above, and reduced with 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol (30 min). The product was then alkylated with 0.15 m N-ethylmaleimide (2 h) and purified by reverse-phase chromatography. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of recombinant and synthetic peptides was carried out as described (29Corti A. Gasparri A. Sacchi A. Curnis F. Sangregorio R. Colombo B. Siccardi A.G. Magni F. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3866-3872PubMed Google Scholar). Epitope mapping of mouse antibodies was carried out by direct and sandwich ELISAs. Direct ELISA was performed using various CgA peptides adsorbed onto polyvinylchloride microtiter plates and a goat anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase conjugate, as detecting reagent, as described previously (14Corti A.

Sandwich ELISAs of (STA)1–78 were performed using various anti-CgA mAbs adsorbed onto polyvinyl chloride microtiter plates, biotinylated mAbs, and streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate as described (30Corti A. Gasparri A. Chen F.X. Pelagi M. Brandazza A. Sidoli A. Siccardi A.G. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 73: 924-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Adhesion assays were carried out using 96-well polystyrene cell culture plates (Costar, catalog no. 3595). Before each assay 2 × 106 NIH 3T3 cells were seeded in T80 culture flasks (Nunc) and cultured for 72 h in DMEM-GPSF, at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Confluent cells were detached from culture flasks by treatment with a prewarmed trypsin-EDTA solution (0.5 mg/ml trypsin, 0.2 mg/ml EDTA) for 4–5 min at 37 °C and mixed with DMEM-GPSF. About 6–7 × 106 cells were usually recovered from one flask. The cells were washed one time with 20 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride, centrifuged at 200 ×g for 10 min, and resuspended in DMEM-GPS containing 0–0.2% FBS and 3% BSA (106 cell/ml). Adhesion assays with solid-phase bound peptides were carried out as follows. 96-Well cell culture plates were coated with peptide solutions in PBS (50 μl/well, 90 min at 37 °C). After coating, the plates were washed with 0.9% sodium chloride, filled with 3% BSA (Sigma) in DMEM (200 μl/well) and left to incubate for 1 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed again as above and filled with the cell suspension (50 μl/well). After incubation in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C (3–4 h), the medium was aspirated using a multichannel pipette. The cells were washed twice with DMEM and fixed by adding 100 μl/well of a solution containing 3% paraformaldehyde and 2% sucrose in PBS (15 min at room temperature). The solution was then aspirated using a needle connected to a vacuum pump. Fixed cells were stained by adding 50 μl/well of 0.5% crystal violet, in 20% methanol (10 min) and washed with water. The absorbance at 540 nm was read with a microplate reader. Adhesion assays with liquid-phase peptides were carried out essentially as described above except that peptide solutions were prepared in DMEM containing 4 mm glutamine, 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin (DMEM-GPS2×), 0–0.4% FBS, and 6% BSA. Peptide solutions (50 μl/well) and NIH 3T3 cell suspension in DMEM (50 μl/well) were sequentially added to microtiter plates, incubated for 2–3 h, and stained as described above. CASMC adhesion assays were carried out as described for NIH 3T3 cells, except that cells were cultured in smooth muscle cell basal medium-FBS medium (see above). To investigate the structure-activity relationships of CgA, we have prepared various recombinant and synthetic fragments. Each fragment is indicated with its sequence numbers (according to Konecki et al. (31Konecki D.S. Benedum U.M. Gerdes H.H. Huttner W.B. J. Biol.

(STA)1–78, containing the vasostatin sequence, and (STA)1–48 were obtained by recombinant DNA technology (14Corti A. Sanchez L.P. Gasparri A. Flavio C. Longhi R. Brandazza A. Siccardi A. Sidoli A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas the other peptides used in this work were prepared by chemical synthesis. The molecular mass of (STA)1–78 and (STA)1–48, as measured by electrospray mass spectrometry, was 9069.7 and 5579 Da, respectively (expected mass, 9069.3 and 5579 Da). To study the function of the disulfide loop, we have also prepared a peptide encompassing residues 7–57 with an oxidized disulfide bridge (peptide (Y)7–57-SS) and another one with the cysteines reduced and alkylated withN-ethylmaleimide (peptide 7–57-SEtM). The molecular mass of (Y)7–57-SS and 7–57-SEtM, were 5949 and 6038 Da, respectively (expected 5950 and 6039 Da) by electrospray mass spectrometry. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of recombinant (STA)1–78 and (STA)1–48 showed that both products were homogeneous under reducing and nonreducing conditions (data not shown), indicating that these products did not contain disulfide-related aggregated material. ELISAs carried out with various mAbs against the N-terminal region of CgA (14Corti A. Sanchez L.P. Gasparri A. Flavio C. Longhi R. Brandazza A. Siccardi A. Sidoli A. Eur. J.

Open table in a new tab The effect of (STA)1–78 on NIH 3T3 cell adhesion was first investigated using this peptide bound to a solid phase. Preliminary experiments showed that 1 μg/ml (STA)1–78 induces proadhesive effects in the presence of 0.1–0.2% FBS. With 0.5–1% FBS, cell adhesion occurred even in the absence of (STA)1–78, while in the absence of FBS the effect of (STA)1–78 was weaker (not shown). Thus, subsequent experiments were carried out using 0.1–0.2% FBS. Under these conditions, coating with 0.3– 1 μg/ml (STA)1–78 was sufficient to increase adhesion and spreading of NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Also, the synthetic peptide 7–57-SEtM increased cell adhesion, indicating that the sequence 7–57 contains a proadhesive site and that the Cys17–Cys38 disulfide bridge is not necessary for activity. Of note, a “bell-shaped” dose-response curve was obtained with (STA)1–78 but not with 7–57-SEtM (Fig.1 A). Proadhesive effects were also obtained with peptides lacking the disulfide loop region, such as 47–68(Y), 39–59, 39–68(Y), but not 60–68(Y), either bound to a solid phase (Fig. 1, A andB) or added to the liquid phase (Fig.2 A). Significant effects were obtained also in the absence of FBS (Fig. 2, upper panels). Other 22–24-mer peptides spanning most of the regions 1–46, 68–244, and 416–439, the latter corresponding to the CgA C-terminal region, were inactive (Fig. 2, B andC). Thus, peptides that included residues 47–57 increased adhesion and spreading of NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that this region of vasostatin contains a cell adhesion site. Of note, (STA)1–48 was poorly active or not active, suggesting that the contribution of this region to the adhesive activity of (STA)1–78 is of little or no importance (data not shown). To investigate the contribution of each residue in the region 47–57 (RILSILRHQNL), we prepared various 47–68(Y) peptides in which single residues were substituted with alanine. Interestingly, the activity was diminished, but not completely abolished, by some substitutions (Fig.3). In particular, replacement of residues His54, Gln55, or Asn56resulted in a marked decrease of the activity at high concentrations but not at lower levels. This behavior was observed in several assays. Although these results indicate that these residues are critical for the activity of 47–68(Y) at high doses, we cannot conclude that they are directly involved in the interaction with a target molecule. Given that changes with alanine may decrease the polarity of the peptide, these results could be also explained by changes in the peptide physico-chemical properties. The effect of CgA fragments on cell adhesion was also investigated using primary CASMC. As shown in Fig. 4, (STA)1–78 and 7–57-SEtM increased adhesion of CASMC to solid phases, whereas (STA)1–48 was less efficient. These results confirm the importance of the region 47–57 in the proadhesive activity of (STA)1–78. In previous reports, we have described several mAbs directed to epitopes located within the N-terminal region of CgA (14Corti A. Sanchez L.P. Gasparri A. Flavio C. Longhi R. Brandazza A. Siccardi A. Sidoli A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,26Corti A. Longhi R. Gasparri A. Chen F. Pelagi M. Siccardi A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To investigate the topographic relationships between epitopes and adhesion sites, we studied the epitope location and the capability of each antibody to inhibit cell adhesion induced by (STA)1–78. The epitope location was studied by measuring antibody binding to recombinant and synthetic fragments. It is important to note that these studies, although they can provide information on the regions of CgA that contain residues critical for the antibody binding, do not necessarily define the epitope boundaries. The results (Table I) suggest that the region 7–20 contains some residues recognized by mAb 4D5. The disulfide bridge is not necessary for 4D5 binding, since the 7–57SEtM peptide was recognized efficiently. In contrast, 7D1 binds an epitope located within residues 34–46, and the disulfide bridge is critical for the binding. mAb 5A8, 5B12, and B4E11 are directed to epitopes located within the regions 47–57, 47–60, and 68–70, respectively (Table I), whereas A11 is directed to residues 81–90 (26Corti A. Longhi R. Gasparri A. Chen F. Pelagi M. Siccardi A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In cell adhesion inhibition assays, mAb 5A8, 5B12, and B4E11 inhibited NIH 3T3 cell adhesion to plates coated with (STA)1–78, whereas 4D5, 7D1, and A11 were poorly active or not active, even at concentrations higher than those necessary to saturate (STA)1–78 (Fig.5, A and C). None of the antibodies affected NIH 3T3 cell adhesion to FBS-coated plates (Fig. 5 B). Thus, antibodies against epitopes located within the region 47–70 neutralized specifically the adhesive activity of (STA)1–78. Interestingly, the epitopes recognized by mAbs 5A8 and 5B12 appear to colocalize with the adhesion site. In an attempt to better define the epitope boundaries of these mAbs, we investigated their reactivity using the peptides encompassing the region 47–68 in which single residues were replaced with alanine. The results of direct binding assays, with solid-phase peptides, showed that residues Arg53, His54, and Leu57are critical for antibody binding (Fig.6). The loss of binding was not related to solid-phase artifacts, since similar results were obtained by competitive binding assays in which each peptide was added to the liquid phase (not shown). These data strengthen the hypothesis that an adhesion site is located within the region 47–57 and suggest that mAbs 5A8 and 5B12 inhibit (STA)1–78-induced adhesion by blocking this site. In contrast, B4E11 recognizes residues 68–70 (26Corti A. Longhi R. Gasparri A. Chen F. Pelagi M. Siccardi A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) outside the adhesion region. Possibly, B4E11 inhibits cell adhesion by steric hindrance or by inducing structural changes in (STA)1–78. The epitope/adhesion site topography was further investigated by measuring the capability of these mAbs to form molecular sandwiches with (STA)1–78. The epitope of B4E11 is sterically distinct from those of 7D1, 5A8, and 5B12 as indicated by the capability of a biotin-B4E11 conjugate to form molecular sandwiches with (STA)1–78 and these antibodies (Fig. 7). Moreover, similar experiments showed that the 5A8 epitope is sterically distinct from that of 4D5, 7D1, and B4E11, but not from that of 5B12 (Fig. 7). A previous study showed that the A11 epitope is sterically distinct from that of B4E11 (26Corti A. Longhi R. Gasparri A. Chen F. Pelagi M. Siccardi A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A schematic representation of the topographic relationships between epitopes and adhesion site is shown in Fig.8.Figure 8Schematic representation of epitope and cell adhesion site topography.

This fragment contains at least three sites characterized by sequence similarity with other adhesive molecules and integrin binding motifs, including (a) a KGD sequence (residues 9–11) present in barbourin, a snake venom disintegrin (32Blobel C.P. White J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); (b) a sequence characterized by 32% identity and 64% similarity with that of a portion of the fibronectin type III-9 domain of tenascin (residues 19–37) (33Siri A. Carnemolla B. Saginati M. Leprini A. Casari G. Baralle F. Zardi L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 34Spring J. Beck K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Cell. 1989; 59: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar); (c) an RGD sequence (residues 43–45) often present in extracellular matrix adhesive proteins (35Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher D. Cell. 1986; 44: 517-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). However, the results of the present study suggest that the main structural determinant of CgA fragment proadhesive activity resides within residues 47–57, i.e. in a region adjacent to the KGD-loop-RGD domain (Fig. 8). Indeed, the proadhesive activity of fragment (STA)1–48 was markedly lower than that of (STA)1–78, whereas fragments containing residues 7–57 were highly effective. Moreover, synthetic peptides lacking the KGD-loop-RGD domain, such as peptide (Y)47–68, were sufficient to induce fibroblast adhesion either bound to solid phases at 200–400 nm or added to the liquid phase at 5–10 μm, indicating that this domain is not necessary for the adhesion activity. Interestingly, the sequence 50–57 (SILRHQNL) is 100% conserved within human, mouse, rat, porcine, bovine, ostrich, and frog CgA (3Simon J.P. Aunis D. Biochem.

In contrast, the RGD sequence is replaced with QGD in the mouse and rat (39Wu H.J. Rozansky D.J. Parmer R.J. Gill B.M. O'Connor D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13130-13134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Iacangelo A. Okayama H. Eiden L.E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), whereas the KGD is replaced with TGD or EDN in horse and frog CgA, respectively (38Turquier V. Vaudry H. Jegou S. Anouar Y. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4104-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).2 The poor conservation and the observation that a CgA mutein with RGE in place of RGD can still induce fibroblast adhesion after limited trypsinization (24Gasparri A. Sidoli A. Sanchez L.P. Longhi R. Siccardi A.G. Marchisio P.C. Corti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20835-20843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) suggest that both RGD and KGD domains are not critical for CgA adhesion activity. Also the disulfide bridge does not appear to be necessary for activity, since a peptide with reduced and alkylated cysteines (7–57-SEtM) induced fibroblast and CASMC proadhesive effects. Interestingly, the activity of this peptide was even stronger than that of (STA)1–78, particularly at relatively high concentrations considering that the dose-response curve of (STA)1–78 is “bell-shaped.” Possibly, the disulfide bridge, although not necessary for the adhesive activity, is critical for the structure of (STA)1–78 at different doses. For instance, monomer-dimer transitions might occur at higher concentrations (9Thiele C. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1223-1231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14Corti A. Sanchez L.P. Gasparri A. Flavio C. Longhi R. Brandazza A. Siccardi A. Sidoli A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and change the adsorption onto the solid phase and/or the activity. However, other interpretations are possible, and further studies are necessary to investigate the quaternary structure/activity relationships. Among a panel of different antibodies described previously (14Corti A. Sanchez L.P. Gasparri A. Flavio C. Longhi R. Brandazza A. Siccardi A. Sidoli A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26Corti A. Longhi R. Gasparri A. Chen F. Pelagi M. Siccardi A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we have identified three antibodies (mAb 5A8, 5B12, and B4E11) that neutralize the (STA)1–78 adhesion activity. Epitope mapping experiments, based on the alanine scanning method, showed that residues Arg53-His54 and Leu57, included in the RHQNL sequence, are very critical for 5A8 and 5B12 binding, the reactivity being markedly decreased when these residues were replaced with alanine. Thus, these antibodies bind epitopes that sterically overlap, at least partially, with the cell adhesion site. The fact that Gln55-Asn56 can be replaced with alanine with minor effects on the antibody reactivity strongly suggests that these epitopes are conformational and not linear. Computer-aided secondary structure prediction suggested that the 47–57 region contains an amphiphilic α-helix (26Corti A. Longhi R. Gasparri A. Chen F. Pelagi M. Siccardi A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Accordingly, circular dichroism analysis of peptide 47–68(Y) showed that this peptide tends to form α-helix in solution (data not shown). Thus, given that there are 3.6 residues per turn in α-helixes, it is very likely that the Arg53-His54 and Leu57 are accessible to the antibody, while Gln55-Asn56are located on the opposite side of the helix. No sequence similarity between the 47–57 region and other known adhesive motifs was found that might suggest a function. However, a previous study showed that the region 40–65 includes a calcium-dependent calmodulin-binding site (41Yoo S.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6134-6140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although the biological meaning of this remains unknown, the binding of calmodulin and antibodies to this region suggests that this site is accessible and may therefore interact with other biological structures. The high sequence conservation and accessibility strongly suggest that this region plays an important role. Besides cell adhesion, CgA N-terminal fragments can exert other biological effects. For instance, vasostatin-1 can inhibit vascular tension (18Aardal S. Helle K.B. Regul. Pept. 1992; 41: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 19Aardal S. Helle K.B. Elsayed S. Reed R.K.

Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent reports showed that vasostatin-1 is neurotoxic in neuronal/microglial cell cultures (23Ciesielski-Treska J. Ulrich G. Taupenot L. Chasserot-Golaz S. Corti A. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14339-14346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and can kill Gram-positive bacteria as well as a variety of filamentous fungi at μmconcentrations (36Lugardon K. Raffner R. Goumon Y. Corti A. Delmas A. Bulet P. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10745-10753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that CgA fragments contribute, together with other antibacterial peptides from neural and neuroendocrine tissues, to innate immunity during stress situations. Interestingly, antifungal activity was observed with (STA)1–78, peptide 7–57 (with or without disulfide bridge) and peptide 47–60. In contrast, inhibition of parathormone secretion was obtained with peptide 1–40, but not after reduction and alkylation. It seems, therefore, that different activities require structural determinants contained in different regions of vasostatin and that the disulfide bridge may or may not be critical. Interestingly, both antifungal and proadhesive activities appear to rely on the region 47–60 and do not require the disulfide loop. The mechanisms of action underlying all these effects and their physiological significance still need to be investigated. In addition to fibroblasts, we have found that also smooth muscle cells are affected by vasostatin. The long incubation time required for optimal adhesion of both cell types (3–4 h) suggests that the adhesive activity is probably indirect and requires the synthesis of other proteins. Moreover, the observation that FBS is critical for the effect of (STA)1–78 suggests that other proteins present in FBS are involved in the (STA)1–78 mechanism of cell adhesion. The hypothesis of an indirect mechanism is also supported by the finding that peptide 47–68(Y) can elicit proadhesive effects in our assays even when added in solution. Interestingly, recent work by Soriano et al.(25Soriano J.V. Pepper M.S. Taupenot L. Bader M.F. Orci L. Montesano R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) has shown that CgA at nanomolar concentration may increase deposition of basement membrane components, such as collagen type IV, laminin, and perlecan, by mammary epithelial cells and alter ductal morphogenesis in vitro. Given the physiological importance of cell adhesion for fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells and for the production of extracellular matrix, one appealing possibility is that secretion of CgA might contribute to determining the architecture and remodeling of tissues where this protein is released, such as in normal and neoplastic neuroendocrine tissues or, in the case of smooth muscle cells, within the wall of vessels with sympathetic nerve endings. Moreover, since CgA immunoreactivity has been detected in polymorphonuclear cell secretions (41Yoo S.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6134-6140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the capability of its fragments to affect the physiology of fibroblast could be important in inflammatory reactions and tissue repair. The reagents identified in this study (peptides and antibodies) could provide useful tools for investigating these hypotheses."

Recently, we have shown that HOXA5 is a potent transactivator of p53 in breast cells and thus may affect the response of breast cancer cells to DNA damage. To determine whether HOXA5 played a role in growth and homeostasis in breast cells, we studied its interaction with the progesterone receptor. The progesterone receptor (PR) belongs to the superfamily of nuclear receptors whose members co-ordinate morphogenesis of the mammary gland in response to binding to their cognate ligands. An increased expression of the endogenous PR gene was seen in MCF-7 cells following induced expression of an exogenously transfectedHOXA5 gene. HOXA5, but not HOXB4, -B5, or -B7 activated thePR promoter in two breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and Hs578T.

Recently, it was reported that the loss of function of several genes belonging to HOX group 9 impaired proper development of mammary glands in mice during and after pregnancy, thereby leading to a strong deficit in milk production and, hence, an abnormal lactation capacity (3Chen F.

Seven putative HOX-binding sequences were found in the 1.1-kilobase pairs upstream regulatory sequence of the human progesterone receptor gene. The sequence similarity for the HOX-binding sites (Fig. 1, Aand B) was determined by using the “sequence find” option within the DNA Strider program.To investigate a possible regulation of PR by HOX proteins, a transient transfection assay was performed using the ER+/PR+ human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. Cells were cotransfected with the reporter plasmid, −1121 bp PRLuc, together with expression plasmids encoding full-length human HOXA5. Strikingly, we found a 60–66-fold increase in luciferase activity in MCF-7 cells. No such effect was observed when the reporter plasmid was cotransfected with plasmids encoding the paralogous gene,HOXB5, or an upstream effector of HOXA5 function,HOXB4, or another member of the HOX gene family,HOXB7 (Fig. 1 C). None of the HOX proteins affected the renilla luciferase activity of the pRL-SV40-Luc control plasmid (data not shown). To extend these observations, we performed similar experiments in Hs578T cells, a human breast cancer cell line that is ER−/PR−. Transactivation of the PR promoter by HOXA5 was also observed here, and the level of activation was comparable with that of MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1 C). In these cells, HOXB4 showed a low (up to 10-fold), but consistent, level of activation, but HOXB5 and HOXB7 were inactive. These results suggest that in two separate breast cancer cell lines, expression from the PR promoter is highly stimulated specifically by HOXA5, but not by three other members of the HOX gene family. Also, the ER/PR status of the cells did not influence the ability of HOXA5 to transactivate the cells, suggesting that factors responsible for the transactivation effect are present in both cell types.We also varied the dose of HOXA5 plasmid DNA in experiments in MCF-7 cells. We found that the activation effect increased as the dose was increased from 0.25 to 1 μg and then declined when 2 μg was used (data not shown). 1 μg of expression plasmid was therefore used in all subsequent experiments. A mutant of HOXA5 that introduced a stop codon leading to a C-terminal truncation was also tested in these experiments. This mutant, which lacked the HOXA5 DNA-binding site, was unable to activate expression from the PR promoter (data not shown). These results indicate that HOXA5 can activate transcription of the PR promoter in this system, and the transactivation is due to an interaction of the DNA binding domain of HOXA5 protein with the PR promoter.To further define the sequence requirements for the transactivation function, deletion constructs of the PR promoter luciferase construct were tested in cotransfection assays with the full-lengthHOXA5 expression plasmids. Deletion of the −1121-bp PRPLuc construct to −792-bp PRPLuc construct, which removes one putative HOX-binding site, resulted in a 27% reduction in luciferase activity in response to HOXA5 in MCF-7 cells (Fig.2 A) and a 35% reduction in Luc activity in Hs578T cells (Fig. 2 A). A systematic deletion of the next two HOX-binding sites (−460-bp PRPLuc, −294-bp PRPLuc) resulted in only a slight decrease in luciferase activity in both the cell lines. A further deletion to −143 bp (−143-bp PRPLuc) stimulated luciferase activity 40–45% more than the full-length PR-Luc construct in MCF-7 cells but not in Hs578T cells. This increase in Luc activity in MCF-7 cells, but not in Hs578T, suggests the presence of a negative regulatory molecule in Hs578T cells, which is absent in MCF-7 cells, reflecting the genetic heterogeneity between the two cell lines. However, a further deletion to −67 bp resulted in a 2-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with the −143-bp PRPLuc construct in both MCF-7 and Hs578T cells. This stepwise analysis suggested that the site important for transactivation by HOXA5 is located between −67 and −1. In addition, it is quite likely that the removal of a binding site for negative regulatory molecules between −67 and −143 bp within the PR promoter enhanced the positive transcriptional ability of HOXA5. Cotransfection of HOXB4, -B5, or -B7 along with the −67-bp PRPLuc yielded results similar to those shown in Fig. 1 A in MCF-7 and Hs578T cells (Fig. 2 B). Further deletion of the last HOXA5-binding site (located at −62 bp), in constructing the −48-bp PRPLuc, resulted in a drastic decrease of luciferase activity in both cell lines. However, luciferase activity was not completely abolished, suggesting the presence of a putative transactivator binding sequence in this region. From the results obtained by the deletion analysis, it appeared that the 3′-most 67 bp, containing only one HOXA5-binding site and the putative transactivator binding sequence, was sufficient for the transactivation. Finally, the specific deletion of these sequences from the full-length PR-Luc construct completely abolished the ability of HOXA5 to transactivate PR-linked reporter activity, providing confirmation that the 3′-most HOXA5-binding site is essential for the activity of PR.Figure 2Deletion analysis localizes the HOXA5-binding site in the −1121-bp PRPLuc construct. A, schematic representation of the −1121-bp PRPLuc and its deletion constructs, −792-bp PRPLuc, −460-bp PRPLuc, −294-bp PRPLuc, −143-bp PRPLuc, −67-bp PRPLuc, −48-bp PRPLuc or Δ-68 to −1-bp PRPLuc. Cells were transiently transfected with the deletion constructs along with the expression vector, pCMVHOXA5. The results of transcription assays performed with the promoter deletion in MCF-7 and Hs578T cells are shown. Luciferase activities were assayed 36 h after transfection using the Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega Corp.). The results are an average of six independent experiments ± S.D.

To determine whether the “TAAT” core-containing site in the PR promoter is a bona fide HOXA5-binding site, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed. We tested the binding of oligonucleotides corresponding to this site to HOXA5 protein present in nuclear extracts of SAOS2 cells transfected with pCMVHOXA5. Western analysis of cell extracts using a HOXA5-specific antibody showed the overexpression of the 40–42-kDa HOX protein in HOXA5-transfected MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Equal amounts of protein from cells transfected with vector DNA and pCMVHOXA5 were used. Nuclear extracts from vector-transfected and HOXA5-transfected MCF-7 cells were incubated with a 32P-end-labeled 30-mer oligonucleotide probe containing the HOXA5-binding site (Fig.3 A). HOXA5 produced a protein-DNA complex efficiently with the probe containing the wild type sequence (TAAT) (lane 2). Addition of 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe resulted in inhibition of this binding (lane 3), while a heterologous probe of a random sequence did not mediate competitive inhibition of protein/DNA binding (lane 4). Furthermore, when cell extracts were mixed with an oligonucleotide probe that carries two mutations (TGGT) in the core binding site, no protein/DNA complex formation was observed (lane 5). Finally, HOXA5 antibodies (lane 6) caused a supershift of the bound HOXA5 protein-oligonucleotide complex. These results, combined with detailed mutational analysis, indicate that the core sequence TAAT is necessary for this binding. These results clearly show that the TAAT-containing sequence present in the −67-bp PR promoter is indeed a HOX-binding sequence.Figure 3Mutations in the HOX-binding core TAAT abolish DNA binding and drastically reduce transactivation of −67-bp PRLuc by HOXA5. Nuclear extracts of SAOS2 cells transfected with the plasmid vector, pCDM8 or pCMVHOXA5, were prepared and electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed (described under “Materials and Methods”). For gel-shift analysis (A), end-labeled wild type (WT) oligonucleotide probe, containing the HOXA5-binding site, was hybridized with extracts from cells transfected with vector alone (lane 1) or pCMVHOXA5 alone (lane 2), and for competition assays, along with cold, 50-fold excess of the wild type oligonucleotide (lane 3) or random oligonucleotide (lane 4). Lane 5 shows binding assay using the mutant oligonucleotide (as described in B) with protein extracts from cells transfected with pCMVHOXA5.

The oligonucleotide probe used contains the HOX-binding site from thePR promoter (B). C, MCF-7 and Hs578T cells were transiently transfected with the constructs of −67-bp PRPLuc or −67-bp PRPLuc with either a AA to GG or A to G mutation in the core HOX-binding site, along with the expression plasmid pCMVHOXA5. Results are an average of six experiments ± S.D. D, MCF-7 and Hs578T cells were transiently transfected with the constructs of −1121-bp PRPLuc or −1121-bp 3′ HOX-MUT-2 PRPLuc (TAAT to TAGT mutation in the core HOX-binding site), along with the expression plasmid pCMVHOXA5. Results are an average of three experiments ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In a final test to confirm that the site lost in the −48-bp promoter construct is the HOXA5-binding site, we tested the in vivoeffects of the same mutations in the core binding site that had abolished DNA-protein complex formation in cell extracts. Transient transfection assays were performed using two −67-bp PRPLuc reporter constructs, MUT-1 containing two mutations (TGGT) or MUT-2 carrying one mutation (TAGT, MUT-2), in the core-binding site. The results showed that transactivation of the reporter gene was strikingly reduced with both the mutant promoters (Fig. 3B). In addition, we mutated the 3′-most HOXA5-binding site within the context of the whole PR promoter construct by converting the TAAT to TAGT. The mutated construct had a 6–9-fold lower luciferase activity when cotransfected with HOXA5 into MCF-7 and Hs578T cells, compared with the wild type 1211-bp PR promoter construct (Fig. 3 C). Thus, by a number of separate and complementary tests, we have shown that transactivation of the −1121-bp PR promoter-Luc construct is mediated by direct binding of HOXA5 to a single site, at −62 bp, in this promoter.The above results suggest that HOXA5 is a transactivator of thePR gene. To test this possibility, we generated stable MCF-7 cultures that could express the HOXA5 gene under the control of an ecdysone-inducible system. Within 3 h after induction of HOXA5 expression by the ecdysone analog, Ponasterone A (Pon A), levels of the endogenous 116-kDa PR-B isoform were induced up to 3-fold (Fig.4 A), when compared with the control vector. The induction of the PR-B isoform, although small, was observed in a reproducible manner in duplicate experiments.Figure 4HOXA5 up-regulates PR levels in breast cancer cells. Western blot analysis of cell extracts at different times following addition of Pon A to cultures of MCF7-HOX-2. Antibodies used were HOXA5 (HOXA5–2, Babco), PR (C-19, Santa Cruz), and actin (AC-15, Sigma). HOXA5 is frequently seen as a 40–42-kDa doublet; a third band is seen after Pon A induction of the transfected HOXA5 gene in MCF-7-HOX2 cells. The multiple bands may be due to post-translational modifications or alternate splicing. The smaller molecular weight bands seen in the blot probed for PR protein may represent degraded PR protein products.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In summary, we have described an effect of HOXA5 upon the protein levels of PR-B isoform. HOXA5 is a member of a class of proteins known principally for their role in pattern formation during development. Also, an oncogenic function for both murine and human HOX proteins, by overexpression or by untimely expression, has been well established (11Cillo C. Faiella A. Cantile M. Boncinelli E. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 12van Oostveen J. Bijl J. Raaphorst F. Walboomers J. Meijer C. Leukemia ( Baltimore ). 1999; 13: 1675-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). While the oncogenic activity of overexpressedHox genes has substantial experimental support, these observations and our data suggest additional functions for HOXA5. Our recent studies (4Raman V. Martensen S.A. Reisman D. Evron E. Odenwald W.F. Jaffee E. Marks J. Sukumar S. Nature. 2000; 405: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) indicate that HOXA5 is a potent transcriptional activator of p53 in breast cells. Breast cancer cell lines and primary breast cancer specimens displayed a co-ordinate loss ofp53 and HOXA5 mRNA and protein expression. We proposed that reduced or lack of expression of HOXA5 could lead to loss of p53 expression, providing a mechanism, other than by mutation, for loss of function of this important tumor suppressor during the development of breast cancer. Based upon the results of the study presented here, we raise the possibility that HOX genes play an important role in normal breast development by regulating the expression of the PR gene and that its loss in breast cancer could influence the transcription and thereby the expression of several key genes important for normal differentiation.In our experiments, HOXA5 is a strong positive regulator of PR. We have yet to define the biological significance of the relationship described here. The major modulators of PR concentration are the ovarian hormone estrogen and progesterone itself (13Brisken C. Park S. Vass T. Lydon J.P. O'Malley B.W. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5076-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). However, even though estrogen levels are biphasic in the mammary gland during menstrual cycle in normal women, the concentrations of PR are uniform, suggesting that its synthesis is not under the exclusive control of estrogen in breast tissues (14Battersby S. Robertson B.J. Anderson T.J. King R.J. McPherson K. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 65: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained using estrogen receptor-α knock-out mice. In the ERnull-homozygous mice, PR mRNA was nevertheless detected, suggesting the existence of both estrogen-dependent and -independent gene regulation (15Korach K.S. J. Soc. Gynecol. Investig. 2000; 7 Suppl. 1: S16-S17Crossref Google Scholar). In this study we have identified HOXA5 as a novel upstream regulator of PR gene expression in normal breast cells and presented evidence for the presence of an additional factor, other than estrogen, that controls PR expression in breast cancer. Similar to its well known role in body patterning during embryonic development as an “master regulator of gene action,” it is possible that HOXA5 has multiple roles in breast development and that loss of HOXA5 will have a major impact upon the action of multiple genes important in homeostasis. The proper development of the embryonic body plan depends, in large part, on a family of genes called the HOX genes (1Veraksa A. Del Campo M. McGinnis W. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 69: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,2Greer J.M. Puetz J. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 2000; 403: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that the loss of function of several genes belonging to HOX group 9 impaired proper development of mammary glands in mice during and after pregnancy, thereby leading to a strong deficit in milk production and, hence, an abnormal lactation capacity (3Chen F. Capecchi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Our own studies have shown that the expression of one member of this family, HOXA5, is undetectable in nearly 60% of breast cancers (4Raman V. Martensen S.A. Reisman D. Evron E. Odenwald W.F. Jaffee E. Marks J. Sukumar S. Nature. 2000; 405: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). One target of HOXA5 action could be the progesterone receptor. The progesterone receptor belongs to a superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors (5Shyamala G. Yang X. Cardiff R.D. Dale E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3044-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Conneely O.M. Lydon J.P. De Mayo F. O'Malley B.W. J. Soc. Gynecol. Investig. 2000; 7 Suppl. 1: S25-S32Crossref Google Scholar). Through its binding to progesterone, PR1 is implicated in the control of proliferation, differentiation, and development of the breast and uterine tissues (5Shyamala G. Yang X. Cardiff R.D. Dale E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3044-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Conneely O.M. Lydon J.P. De Mayo F. O'Malley B.W. J. Soc. Gynecol. Investig. 2000; 7 Suppl. 1: S25-S32Crossref Google Scholar). In the breast, while estrogen transmits a proliferative signal, progesterone through its interaction with PR, functions as a modulator of estrogen action, leading to pathways of differentiation (5Shyamala G. Yang X. Cardiff R.D. Dale E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3044-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Conneely O.M. Lydon J.P. De Mayo F. O'Malley B.W. J. Soc. Gynecol. Investig. 2000; 7 Suppl. 1: S25-S32Crossref Google Scholar). The most direct evidence for PR function in the mammary gland comes from studies with mice lacking the PR gene (7Lydon J.P. DeMayo F.J. Funk C.R. Mani S.K. Hughes A.R. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Shyamala G. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). The mammary glands of these mice show incomplete ductal branching and failure of lobulo-alveolar development (7Lydon J.P. DeMayo F.J. Funk C.R. Mani S.K. Hughes A.R. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Shyamala G. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). Few upstream regulators ofPR gene expression have been identified (8Moutsatsou P. Sekeris C.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 816: 99-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Soc. Gynecol. Investig. 2000; 7 Suppl. 1: S33-S37Crossref Google Scholar).

In vitro experiments with bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells have shown that MCTP can cause a moderate decrease in their ability to act as a permeability barrier (14Taylor D.W. Wilson D.W. Lamé M.W. Dunston S.D. Jones A.D. Segall H.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 143: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), cell proliferation is inhibited (15Hoorn C.M. Wagner J.G. Roth R.A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 120: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), prolonged cell cycle arrest in G2-M occurs (16Thomas H.C. Lamé M.W. Wilson D.W. Segall H.J.

Segall H.J. Wilson D.W. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1998; 151: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Apoptosis has recently been shown to occur in rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells following the in vivoadministration of MCT (19Jones P.L. Rabinovitch M. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1131-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Previous work has supported the involvement of endothelial cells as the target for MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension; however, the mechanism(s) by which these cells lose their ability to function correctly is unknown. With respect to pyrrole adduct formation this has been restricted to the measurement of covalent binding to endothelial cell DNA (16Thomas H.C. Lamé M.W. Wilson D.W. Segall H.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 141: 319-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wagner J.G. Petry T.W. Roth R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L517-L522PubMed Google Scholar). MCTP has been shown to react in a facile manner with the thiol groups of cysteine and glutathione (21Mattocks A.R. Bird I. Toxicol. Lett. 1983; 16: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Mattocks A.R. Jukes R. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1990; 75: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Reed R.L. Miranda C.L.

A carbonium ion can be generated at both the C7 and the C9 positions on the pyrrole ring with the pyrrole structure being stabilized by resonance structures that share a charge with the bridge head nitrogen (26Huxtable R.J. Gen. Pharmacol. 1979; 10: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This delocalization of charge for MCTP confers soft electrophile characteristics (27Pearson R.G. Songstad J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 1827-1836Crossref Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 28Coles B. Drug Metab. Rev. 1985; 15: 1307-1334Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar) in line more with reactivity toward soft nucleophile protein side chains than with nucleic acids, which are harder nucleophiles. It has previously been shown that MCTP reacts with thiol groups on proteins such as hemoglobin (22Mattocks A.R. Jukes R. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1990; 75: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Seawright A.A. Hrdlicka J. Wright J.D. Kerr D.R. Mattocks A.R. Jukes R. Vet. Hum.

Of the limited number of proteins identified as specific targets for MCTP, cytochrome P450 3A, which is responsible for the dehydrogenation of MCT, has also been shown to form adducts with pyrroles (31Reid M.J. Lamé M.W. Morin D. Wilson D.W. Segall H.J. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 1998; 12: 157-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have coupled the use of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) to identify five major MCTP target proteins in human lung endothelial cells and discuss their potential relevance to the enigmatic process of pulmonary hypertension. All reagents unless otherwise indicated were obtained from Fisher. Crotalaria spectabilis was grown under a confined atmosphere of 14CO2, and the14C-monocrotaline (14C-MCT, purity >98%) was extracted and purified as described before (32Lamé M.W. Morin D. Wilson D.W. Segall H.J. J. Label. Compd. Radiopharm. 1996; 38: 1053-1060Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar).14C-MCT was converted to 14C-monocrotaline pyrrole (14C-MCTP, 1.95 mCi/mmol) by the method of Mattockset al. (33Mattocks A.R. Jukes R. Brown J. Toxicon. 1989; 27: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) using tetrabromo-1,2-benzoquinone (Aldrich); the product was recrystallized in hexane:diethyl ether. Using fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry the conversion of MCT to MCTP was found to be complete; daughter spectra contained ions characteristic of the pyrrole (34Pan L.C. Wilson D.W. Lamé M.W. Jones A.D. Segall H.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 118: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 14C-MCTP was stored inN,N-dimethylformamide at −80 °C until just prior to use. Normal human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (passage 7–8) (Clonetics, San Diego, CA), from a 34-year-old female were grown to 80–90% confluence prior to treatment. Cells in 175-cm2 flasks (Falcon polystyrene) were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 with humidity in EGM-2 medium (Clonetics). The medium was replaced with EGM-2 without 10% fetal bovine serum immediately before exposing cells to 105 μm14C-MCTP delivered in 12.9 μl ofN,N-dimethylformamide/25 ml of media. Cells were removed from flasks using 39-cm cell scrapers (Sarstedt, Newton, NC). After pelleting, the cells were washed three times with isotonic phosphate-buffered saline (136.89 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 10.14 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.76 mmKH2PO4, pH, 7.4). The supernatant was removed, and the cells from five flasks were combined, lysed in a 9m urea (ultra pure) solution containing 4% CHAPS (99%), all obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech plus 40 mm Tris and α-toluenesulfonyl fluoride (Aldrich). The latter was added just prior to use in 50 μl of absolute ethanol to give a final concentration of 8 mm. Cells were disrupted with 500 μl of the above, and the lysate was maintained at room temperature for 1 h. The bicinchoninic acid method, as described by the manufacturer (Pierce), was used to determine protein concentrations. Following protein determination, dithiothreitol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to give a final concentration of 64.9 mm; lysate was retained at room temperature for an additional 25 min followed by centrifugation (100,000 ×g) for 1 h at 10 °C. Supernatants were stored under N2 at −80 °C until needed. Protein samples (60 μl, 400 μg of protein) were diluted to 250 μl with 8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 18 mm dithiothreitol, and IPG buffer pH 4–7 was added directly to give a final concentration of 2%. Electrophoresis reagents and hardware, including the Multiphor II platform and EPS 3500XL power supply were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. A trace of bromphenol blue was added, and samples (250 μl) were placed in a Immobiline DryStrip reswelling tray. Immobiline DryStrips (IPG) (13 cm, pH 4–7) were placed gel side down in sample, and a layer of mineral oil was added. Samples were allowed to equilibrate with the strips overnight. Isoelectric focusing was performed on a MultiPhor II platform at 15 °C, and strips were covered with mineral oil with the following voltage program: 360 V, 3 h; 1400 V, 0.5 h; 2600 V, 29 h, maximum current 1 mA. IPG strips were stored under N2 in acid-washed glass tubes at −80 °C prior to separation on the second dimension. After removal from storage, strips were allowed to just thaw before being first equilibrated in 30 ml of 50 mm Tris (pH 6.8) containing 30% v/v glycerol (ultra pure), 2% SDS, 6 m urea, 16.2 mmdithiothreitol, and a trace of bromphenol blue, followed by equilibration in the same buffer system (30 ml) with the replacement of dithiothreitol with 135 mm iodoacetamide (97%, Aldrich). Each equilibration phase was of 10-min duration and performed by placing IPG strips in a Petri dish with agitation generated by a rotary shaker. IPG strips along with a 0.5 × 4-mm agarose cylinder containing 0.5 μg of each molecular weight markers (14,000–66,000, Sigma no. MW-SDS-70L) were sealed on top of a 145 × 140 × 1-mm Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206908) Google Scholar) separating gel (11% T, 2.7% C, acrylamide (99.9%) and bis-N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide were both obtained from Bio-Rad using 0.5% agarose (SeaKem Gold, FMC, Rockland, ME) dissolved in 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Electrophoretic separations were performed at 4 °C, 10 mA/gel. Prior to protein transfers to Sequi-Blot PVDF membranes (0.2 μm, Bio-Rad), gels and membranes were equilibrated for 15 min in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 10% methanol). Overnight transfers were conducted using a Transphor (TE 52) tank blotting unit (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA), using the above buffer (4 °C), and the electrical conditions were 30 V, 200 mA. Membranes were transferred to glass Pyrex dishes and extensively rinsed with numerous changes of distilled water followed by drying under a stream of N2 and then a final dehydration step in a vacuum desiccator under house vacuum. All glassware used in this process and subsequent digestion protocols were thoroughly cleaned employing sonication in dilute Alconox (Alconox, Inc., New York, NY), and then 0.5 N HCl, distilled water rinses following each procedure coupled with a terminal methanol (HPLC grade) wash. The dried membrane was placed in an autoradiography cassette FBXC and covered with a BioMax TranScreen-LE intensifying screen containing BioMax MS film (Eastman Kodak). Cassettes were stored at −80 °C until the film was developed. After film development, proteins were matched to autoradiographic film spots by staining the membranes for 60 s with 0.005% w/v sulforhodamine B (laser grade, Aldrich) in 30% v/v aqueous methanol containing 0.1% acetic acid with gentle agitation, followed by a 30-s water rinse (36Pappin D.J.C. Smith B.J. Methods in Molecular Biology, Protein Sequencing Protocols. 64. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 165-173Google Scholar). Proteins containing 14C-pyrrole adducts were excised for tryptic digestion. Sections of membrane containing protein were added to microreaction vessels (0.3 ml) fitted with PTFE-lined caps (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) and washed with 300 μl of distilled water. Protein spots were then covered with 7 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 1% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Calbiochem) and 280 ng of sequencing grade-modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). Vials were sealed and placed in a secondary container, which was subsequently immersed overnight in a water bath (28 °C). Peptides were extracted from the PVDF matrix by adding 50 μl of a 50% ethanol (Aldrich, spectrophotometric grade): 50% formic acid (purity 99%) to the digestion medium and sonicating vials in a Branson ultrasonic cleaner (Shelton, CT) for 30 min. The extract was concentrated to dryness in 100-μl glass Accuform Micro-Vials (Kimble-Kontes, Vineland, NJ) using a Savant Speed Vac concentrator (Laboratory Equipment Company, Hayward, CA); samples were stored at −80 °C until they were analyzed by MALDI. Molecular masses of tryptic peptides were determined using a Voyager-DE STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA), using a nitrogen laser (337 nm) for ionization. A 10 mg/ml solution of recrystallized α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich) matrix was prepared in 50% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide digests were dissolved in 10 μl of 50% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid, and a 0.5-μl aliquot was mixed on the sample target with 0.5 μl of matrix solution and allowed to dry under ambient conditions. Multipoint mass axis calibration was performed using external standards angiotensin I, ACTH(1–17), ACTH(18–39), ACTH(7–38), and bovine insulin. Initial screening was performed in linear mode, and more accurate monoisotopic peptide masses were determined in reflector mode. To determine the identity of selected spots, MS-Fit and in some cases MS-Tag were used to search data bases for peptide mass fingerprints and to match fragment ions observed in post-source decay (PSD) spectra, respectively (37Qiu Y. Benet L.Z. Burlingame A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17940-17953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 38Clauser, K. R., Baker, P., and Burlingame, A. L. (1996) in Proceedings of the 44th ASMS Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics Portland, OR, May 12–16, p. 365Google Scholar). In addition to the above data bases we have used the ExPASy Proteomics tool ProtScale to accomplish hydropathicity calculations (39Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17157) Google Scholar). These calculations were used to determine the potential accessibility of cysteine residues to MCTP. An additional blot and the corresponding autoradiographic analysis were performed for antibody detection of PDI and galectin-1. PVDF membranes were stained with sulforhodamine B, and the proteins were matched with autoradiographic spots. The location of spots previously identified by peptide mass fingerprinting to correspond to galectin-1 and PDI were marked by recording their horizontal and vertical position prior to destaining with 100% methanol and a final rinse with 70% acetonitrile. Blots were sectioned in half, and one portion developed for galectin-1 and the other PDI. Membranes were first blocked with 3% nonfat milk (Bio-Rad) in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris buffer (TBS), pH 7.4, for 30 min at ambient conditions. This was followed by an overnight incubation with primary antibodies at 4 °C. The primary antibodies were polyclonal rabbit-raised against rat galectin-1 (generously provided by D. N. W. Cooper from UCSF), used at a concentration of 100 μl of serum/20 ml of 3% milk TBS and a mouse monoclonal raised against rat protein-disulfide isomerase synthetic peptide (amino acids 499–509) with a working concentration of 2 μg/ml. The latter was obtained from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, British Columbia, Canada and is known to cross-react with human PDI and calreticulin. After the overnight incubation the blots were washed four times with TBS, and the secondary antibody either goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) was applied at a 1/2000 dilution in 3% milk TBS. Incubations were carried out for 1.5 h at ambient conditions, and the blots were subsequently washed with 0.05% Tween-20 in TBS (two times) followed by four washes with TBS. Blots were developed for 10 min with alkaline phosphatase conjugation substrate kit (Bio-Rad). Results recorded in Fig.1 show that a selective number of proteins form covalent adducts with MCTP. This pattern was consistent from separation to separation, with six separate autoradiographic profiles showing the identical pattern of labeling. Of the 13 labeled spots, seven were chosen for analysis based on the amount of radioactivity associated with them and the intensity of the corresponding sulforhodamine B stain. The latter was used to pick protein spots that were in sufficient quantity and purity to have a reasonable chance of producing an unambiguous match with protein data bases. Of these seven spots, five were identified (TableI) as probable protein-disulfide isomerase precursor ER-60 (EC 5.3.4.1, Swiss-Prot P30101), protein-disulfide isomerase precursor (PDI, EC 5.3.4.1, Swiss-ProtP07237), β- or γ-cytoplasmic actin (Swiss-Prot P02570 and P02571, respectively), cytoskeletal tropomyosin (TM30-NM, Swiss-Prot P12324), and galectin-1 (Swiss-Prot P09382). As recorded in Table I, both the apparent molecular weights and estimated pIs from the two-dimensional separations were in close agreement to data base values with the actual tryptic peptide masses showing excellent coverage and agreement with the expected theoretical values. Typical MALDI mass spectra for tryptic digests of galectin-1 (linear mode) and PDI (reflector mode) are shown in Figs. 2 and3, respectively. PSD spectra were generated to confirm assignments of tryptic fragments from each of these two proteins. The PSD ions described here follow the nomenclature of Biemann (40Biemann K. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 886-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar); fragmentation designation is followed in parenthesis by the m/z value. For galectin-1 the peptide sequence DSNNLCLHFNPR was chosen. The PSD ions showed the expected amino acid immonium ions and numerous other expected fragments. Some of the more prominent ions were the C-terminal ions y2 (272), y2-NH3 (255), and y11 (1372); N-terminal ions b4 (431), b6-H2O (686), and c5 (561); and internal fragment ions NLCL (b ion, 501) and CLHFN (b ion, 672). For PDI the peptide ILFIFIDSDHTDNQR was subjected to PSD. Fragmentation for this peptide was not as informative as that observed for the galectin-1 peptide because of the complexity of the PSD spectrum, but the immonium ions for histidine, isoleucine/leucine, and phenylalanine were present. Some of the more prominent ions included m/z 1790, which represented the MH+-45 (loss of the threonine side chain), y3(417), NQ-NH3 (b ion, 226), FIFIDSDHT-H2O (b ion, 1059), LFIFIDSDHT (b ion, 1190), and FIFIDSDHTD (a ion, 1164). Spots three and five produced no meaningful matches considering apparent molecular weight, estimated pI, or the peptide mass fingerprint. There are also a number of discrete radiolabeled spots that travel with the dye front. Because the number of known metabolites and break down products of MCTP (24Lamé M.W. Jones A.D. Morin D.

The γ complex requires ATP to load β onto DNA. A two-color fluorescence spectroscopic approach was utilized to study this system, wherein both assembly (red fluorescence; X-rhodamine labeled DNA anisotropy assay) and ATP hydrolysis (green fluorescence; phosphate binding protein assay) were simultaneously measured with millisecond timing resolution. The two temporally correlated stopped-flow signals revealed that a preassembled β·γ complex composite rapidly binds primer/template DNA in an ATP hydrolysis independent step. Once bound, two molecules of ATP are rapidly hydrolyzed (∼34 s−1). Following hydrolysis, γ complex dissociates from the DNA (∼22 s−1). Once dissociated, the next cycle of loading is severely compromised, resulting in steady-state ATP hydrolysis rates with a maximum of only ∼3 s−1. Two single-site β dimer interface mutants were examined which had impaired steady-state rates of ATP hydrolysis. The pre-steady-state correlated kinetics of these mutants revealed a pattern essentially identical to wild type. The anisotropy data showed that these mutants decrease the steady-state rates of ATP hydrolysis by causing a buildup of “stuck” binary-ternary complexes on the primer/template DNA.

In each species, the replicase contains accessory proteins that act as processivity factors to turn their DNA polymerases into proficient replicating machines (reviewed in Refs. 1Kelman Z.

Even inMethanococcus jannaschii, an archaeon, the polymerase responsible for copying chromosomal DNA appears to use eukaryotic-like accessory proteins to assist in rapid and efficient duplication of the genome (4Bult C.J.

Individual subunits of these multicomponent replicases combine to form three distinct complexes, a polymerase, a sliding clamp, and a clamp loader (reviewed in Refs. 1Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 171-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 5Young M.C. Reddy M.K. von Hippel P.H.

Typically, the replicative polymerases extend a primer by less than 50 nucleotides before they dissociate from DNA (7Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 976-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When these polymerases are combined with accessory proteins, the clamp and clamp loader, they become highly processive and are able to incorporate thousands of nucleotides in each template-binding event (8Maki H. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12987-12992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The replicase that copies the Escherichia coli genome is pol III1 holoenzyme (10McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19127-19130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its core polymerase, composed of α, ε, and θ subunits, is responsible for DNA synthesis on both the leading and lagging strands during replication. The sliding clamp is an accessory protein of pol III holoenzyme. Analysis, using x-ray diffraction, has shown that the clamp is composed of two β subunits forming a ring-shaped structure with an inner diameter of about 34 Å, large enough to encircle double-stranded DNA (11Kong X.-P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic clamp, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, contains three monomers that form a ring-shaped complex with an overall structure that is strikingly similar to theEscherichia coli clamp (12Krishna T.S. Kong X.P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Once assembled onto DNA by action of the clamp loader, the β sliding clamp binds the core polymerase and effectively tethers core to the DNA template increasing the processivity of DNA synthesis. The clamp loader, γ complex, is a composite of five different subunits with a stoichiometry of two γ subunits and one subunit each of δ, δ′, χ, and ψ (13Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6555-6560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13348-13357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Assembly of the clamp on DNA is powered by hydrolysis of 2 to 3 molecules of ATP per β clamp (15Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Previous work using β mutants and a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog has shown that initial binding of the γ complex clamp loader to the β clamp and subsequent binding of a composite clamp-clamp loader complex to DNA requires ATP binding but not ATP hydrolysis (16Bertram J.G. Bloom L.B. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Beechem J.M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24564-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of ATP, however, is required to complete the loading reaction. A surprising result from this earlier work was that mutations to the dimer interface of β actually decreased the steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis by γ complex. Thus, hydrolysis of ATP by γ complex seems to be associated with a step in the loading reaction that is affected by mutations to the β dimer interface, possibly opening or closing the β ring. To identify the step(s) in the loading reaction requiring ATP hydrolysis, pre-steady-state kinetics of hydrolysis were measured and directly correlated with rates of loading the β clamp onto DNA. Biochemical methods for measuring ATP hydrolysis typically utilize radiolabeled ATP and thin layer chromatography to isolate and quantitate products formed at various time points. An inherent disadvantage of this approach is that of limiting the timing resolution. It is simply not practical to measure thousands of individual hydrolysis reactions during the 300 ms required to assemble the β clamp onto DNA. In this study, PBP covalently labeled with a fluorophore (MDCC) was used in a fluorescence-based ATPase assay developed by M. Webb (17Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In this assay, inorganic phosphate released following ATP hydrolysis is bound rapidly and tightly by MDCC-PBP. This binding results in an increase in fluorescence intensity and a blue shift of the emission spectrum (17Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In this manner, very high signal-to-noise ATP hydrolysis data are obtained with an intrinsic timing resolution that allows for thousands of measurements to be made per second. In addition to measuring ATP hydrolysis, physical interactions between the clamp and clamp loader with p/t DNA were measured in real time using a fluorescence anisotropy-based binding assay. The p/t DNA utilized in these studies has an X-rhodamine probe covalently attached to the 5′ position of the template (80-mer) strand (16Bertram J.G. Bloom L.B. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Beechem J.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30699-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). By using this two-color approach both reactions, ATP hydrolysis and protein-DNA association/dissociation, were measured under identical conditions in a single set of stopped-flow experiments. Thus, ATP hydrolysis could be correlated directly with protein assembly on the DNA. Global analysis methodologies were utilized to simultaneously analyze DNA assembly and ATP hydrolysis from pre-steady-state time scales directly into steady-state. These data and analysis results, when combined with our previous studies on this system, allow us to propose a model that clearly defines each step in the assembly of the β sliding clamp onto DNA (16Bertram J.G.

Purification and labeling of PBP was carried out using procedures outlined in an article by Webb et al. (17Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) with one exception. The protein was loaded directly onto a Q-Sepharose column instead of first passing it through a DEAE-cellulose column. A vector (pSN5182/N) carrying the mutated phoS gene transformed into ANCC75 E. colicells was graciously provided by Martin R. Webb. Subunits of γ complex were reconstituted (14Onrust R.

Both wt and mutant β protein were produced by overexpression of thednaN gene, and purification of the protein as described (22Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized using standard β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite chemistry on an Applied Biosystems synthesizer (model 392 RNA/DNA) and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A 30-nucleotide primer, 5′-CTGGTAATATCCAGAACAATATTACCGCCA-3′, was annealed at the center of an 80-nucleotide template, 5′-TGAGCGTTTTTCCTGTTGCAATGGCTGGCGGTAATATTGTTCTGGATATTACCAGCAAGGCCGATAGTTTGAGTTCTTCT-3′. For anisotropy measurements, the 80-mer template was labeled at the 5′ end with X-rhodamine (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (18Bloom L.B. Turner J. Kelman Z. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30699-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at room temperature in reaction buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 8 mmMgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl. The change in fluorescence of MDCC-PBP was observed on a QuantaMaster (QM-1) fluorometer (Photon Technology International) to study steady-state reactions. Wavelengths for excitation and emission of the fluorophore (MDCC) were selected using monochromators with a 2-nm band pass width. Excitation and emission were set at 425 and 464 nm, respectively. A 195-μl aliquot of protein from a stock solution was placed in the cuvette. A time-based scan from 0 to 1 min was initiated, and approximately 10 s later, the reaction was started by mixing a 5-μl aliquot of ATP into the cuvette. The molarity of ATP was varied to give final concentrations of 400, 200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.3, 3.1, and 1.6 μm. Proteins had final concentrations of 5 μm MDCC-PBP, 100 nm γ complex, 100 nm wt, or mutant β, 100 nm p/t DNA, 0.05 units/ml PNPase, and 50 μm 7-methylguanosine. The linear slope of Pi production was calculated and plotted as a function of ATP concentration to measure Michaelis-Menten constants for the various clamp-loading reactions. Reactions observing Pi release in real time were carried out on an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV Stopped-Flow Reaction Analyzer. A fluorescent probe (MDCC) attached to E. coli PBP was used to measure the rate of Piproduction. Samples were excited at 425 nm (0.5 mm slits) using a monochromater in the path of a xenon light source, and the emission signal was passed through a 455-nm cut on filter. One syringe was filled with 20 μm MDCC-PBP and 800 μm ATP. A second syringe was filled with 2 μm γ complex and 2 μm wt or mutant β. A 50-μl sample from each syringe was combined and aged for 1 s. This mixture was then combined with a 100 μl-aliquot of 1 μm p/t DNA from the third syringe and the change in fluorescence from 0 to 10 s was observed. PNPase (0.05 units/ml) and 7-methylguanosine (150 μm) were included in each syringe to remove contaminating Pi. Data points were collected every 2.5 ms. To quantify the amount of Pi produced in each reaction an experiment excluding ATP was performed. The reaction contained wt β, γ complex, p/t DNA, and MDCC-PBP. Since ATP was not present, this reaction represented 0 μm Pi production. Our experiments contained 5 μm MDCC-PBP, so saturation of the protein in the presence of ATP represented 5 μmPi production. Using this information, the voltage signal acquired by analog detection was normalized from 0 to 5 μm for each experiment. The activity of MDCC-PBP was checked and was shown to be greater than 90% active. A variable amount of Pi contamination prior to the start of a reaction occurred even with careful utilization of the Pi “mop.” For this reason, a variable amount of time 0 signal was subtracted from all stopped-flow traces to compensate for this effect. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were made using theApplied Photophysics Stopped-flow Reaction Analyzer described above with the addition of excitation and emission polarizers (T-format detection). Samples were excited at 580 nm (1-mm slits), and the emission signal was passed through a 610-nm cut on filter (1-mm slits). A 50-μl sample of 1 μm X-rhodamine labeled p/t DNA from one syringe was mixed with a 50-μl sample of 1 μm γ complex, 1 μm wt or mutant β, and 800 μmATP from a second syringe. Points were collected every 0.5 ms from 0 to 2 s. Multiple runs (typically 14) were averaged to increase signal to noise ratio. Fluorescence anisotropy and Pi release data were simultaneously analyzed using Global Analysis techniques (23Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5308-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 24Beechem J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 37-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In this analysis, the coupled differential equations governing the binding reaction (second-order on-rate), followed by a series of first-order transitions on the DNA (coupled to ATP hydrolysis) and protein dissociation from the p/t DNA were numerically solved. The entire reaction was allowed to “cycle,” such that both pre-steady-state and steady-state data could be simultaneously analyzed. The PBP signal change was numerically solved (together with the above equations), using the measured intrinsic on-rate and off-rate of PBP for Pi (k on = 1.36 × 109m−1 s−1,k off = 21 s−1) (17Brune M.

Confidence intervals on all recovered parameters were obtained using rigorous error analysis methodologies (24Beechem J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 37-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). This study utilizes a combined analysis of two distinct real time fluorescence assays to clarify the roles of ATP binding and hydrolysis in the assembly of the β clamp onto DNA. A fluorescence-based ATPase assay was used to measure pre-steady-state kinetics of ATP hydrolysis (17Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). A site-specific mutation, A197C, was made in E. coliphosphate-binding protein (phoS gene product) so that the protein (PBP) could be covalently labeled near the Pi-binding site with an environmentally sensitive probe, MDCC (17Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Bound Pi increases the fluorescence intensity of MDCC 5-fold and blue shifts the emission maximum by 10 nm. Binding of Pi is rapid and tight (17Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) so that measured rates of ATP hydrolysis by γ complex reflect the kinetics of hydrolysis and not the kinetics of Pi binding to PBP. It is important to emphasize that this assay actually measures the rate that Pi is released from γ complex following ATP hydrolysis. Thus, this assay establishes a minimum rate for ATP hydrolysis. A second assay employs fluorescence anisotropy to measure the association and dissociation of β and γ complex with p/t DNA covalently labeled with an X-rhodamine probe. Briefly, the anisotropy of the X-rhodamine probe on p/t DNA increases with the association of β and γ complex (16Bertram J.G. Bloom L.B. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Beechem J.M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24564-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Bloom L.B. Turner J. Kelman Z. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30699-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The observed anisotropy of the probe at any time point is a population weighted average of the anisotropies of all species or complexes present including free p/t DNA, p/t DNA bound by β, p/t DNA bound by γ complex, and p/t DNA bound by β and γ complex. Our previous studies have shown that there is no change in steady-state total-intensity or time-resolved fluorescence lifetime properties due to assembly/disassembly reactions (18Bloom L.B. Turner J.

Hence, the measured anisotropies are directly correlated with DNA assembly and do not require any additional quantum yield correction terms. Appropriate for second-order assembly reactions, this phase of the reaction was modeled numerically using a second-order binding constant. The system exhibited essentially linear second-order behavior over a concentration range of 1:1 to 4:1 mol ratio of β·γ complex-DNA (data not shown). It should be kept in mind that this second-order binding constant represents the interaction of a pre-equilibrated β·γ complex composite that is cycling ATP and not a single static protein species. Previous studies have shown that under steady-state conditions, γ complex hydrolyzes ATP faster in the presence of wt β than β dimers with mutations at their dimer interface, either L108A or L273A (16Bertram J.G. Bloom L.B. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Beechem J.M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24564-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Why would a mutation in β inhibit hydrolysis of ATP by the γ complex? To further address this question, Michaelis-Menten kinetic constants for ATP hydrolysis were measured in loading reactions with wt and mutant clamps using the MDCC-PBP assay to measure Pi released (Fig.1, TableI). As expected,V max in the reaction containing wt β is faster (0.27 μm s−1) than reactions containing L108A (0.15 μm s−1) and L273A (0.09 μm s−1) mutant β. However, the magnitudes of K m values are also lower for the mutants so thatV max/K m values for wt and mutant β clamps are essentially the same. Binding of ATP is required for γ complex to bind β and open the dimer interface (15Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 25Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The effect of the β mutants binding to γ complex is to slow the steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis as for an uncompetitive inhibitor bound to an enzyme-substrate complex that blocks catalytic activity and has the effect of lowering both V max andK m . While these steady-state experiments establish that β mutants are acting in a manner comparable to an uncompetitive inhibitor, they do not establish the precise step in the hydrolysis reaction that is affected. For example, either a decrease in the actual rate of hydrolysis of ATP or a decrease in the rate of γ complex recycling for the next loading reaction due to a decreased rate of dissociation of γ complex from mutant β-DNA complexes could lead to an overall decrease in the steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis.Table IMichaelis-Menten kinetic parameters for P i releaseV maxK mV max/K mμm · s −1μms −1wt β0.27 ± 0.0219 ± 40.014L108A β0.15 ± 0.0211 ± 20.013L273A β0.09 ± 0.018 ± 30.011Data from three individual experiments for each loading reaction was fit to a rectangular hyperbola.

Open table in a new tab Data from three individual experiments for each loading reaction was fit to a rectangular hyperbola. From these fits, the mathematic mean and standard deviation for V max andK m were obtained. In the presence of ATP, a complex between β and γ complex can be preassembled and ATP hydrolysis is not required for this binding reaction (16Bertram J.G. Bloom L.B. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Beechem J.M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24564-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Loading reactions are significantly faster when a complex of β and γ complex are preassembled before mixing with p/t DNA than when reactions are initiated by mixing the three simultaneously (16Bertram J.G. Bloom L.B. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Beechem J.M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24564-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Bloom L.B. Turner J. Kelman Z.

To reduce the kinetic complexity of ATPase assays and decouple the rate of formation of a complex of β and γ complex from the rate of loading β onto DNA, ATPase reactions were initiated by adding a preincubated solution of β,γ complex and ATP to p/t DNA. In these experiments, γ complex, and wt or mutant β clamps were preincubated with MDCC-PBP and ATP for 1 s. The duration of the incubation period was experimentally determined from the binding kinetics measured in the X-rhodamine anisotropy binding assays. When β,γ complex, and ATP are added to X-rhodamine labeled DNA, binding is complete within 300 ms. Additionally, ATPase assays were performed as a function of preincubation time and it was found that a 1-s delay was sufficiently long to establish a β·γ complex pre-equilibrium, yet short enough to minimize the amount of ATP hydrolyzed prior to the start of the reaction with p/t DNA (data not shown). Final concentrations for the stopped-flow experiments were: 500 nm γ complex, 500 nm β, 500 nm p/t DNA, 200 μmATP, and 5 μm MDCC-PBP. Time courses for ATP hydrolysis showed a slight lag, a burst, another lag, and then a linear rise for loading reactions with wt β as well as the β mutants (Fig. 2). The short 20-ms lag is more pronounced for the L108A mutant than wt β and the L273A β mutant is intermediate. A burst of Pi release follows the lag and is essentially identical for reactions containing wt β and β mutants. When each burst phase was fit to an empirical exponential rise term, excluding the initial lag, observed rates of increase in fluorescence intensity were 24 s−1 for wt β, 22 s−1 for L108A β, and 24 s−1 for L273A β (a more detailed analysis of this data will be described below). In addition, the amplitudes of the bursts correspond to 2 molecules of ATP (1 μm) for each γ complex (0.5 μm), a stoichiometry of 1 molecule of ATP for each γ subunit in γ complex. Following the burst, a linear increase in fluorescence intensity is seen corresponding to the steady-state hydrolysis of ATP which is faster for wt β (3.0 s−1) than for L108A β (1.4 s−1) and for L273A β (1.1 s−1). These pre-steady-state results clearly show that the first turnover of ATP is identical in reactions with wt and mutant β clamps. Slower steady-state rates of ATP hydrolysis must be achieved by a differing rate-limiting step that occurs after the first turnover. One possibility is a difference in the rates of dissociation of γ complex from β·DNA complexes. A slower dissociation rate in reactions with β mutants would limit the overall rate of “recycling” of γ complex under steady-state conditions. To directly determine which physical interactions between β,γ complex, and DNA were associated with ATP hydrolysis, pre-steady-state kinetics of association and dissociation of β and γ complex with p/t DNA were measured under conditions identical to those used in ATPase reactions. These experiments were done by measuring the change in anisotropy of an X-rhodamine probe covalently attached to p/t DNA. In these experiments, β,γ complex and ATP were mixed to form a composite complex and then p/t DNA was added to initiate the loading reactions. Final concentrations were 500 nm γ complex, 500 nm β, 500 nmp/t DNA, and 200 μm ATP, identical to those in ATPase assays. Time courses for loading reactions with wt and mutant β clamps overlaid with time courses for ATP hydrolysis are shown in Fig.3, A and B. To facilitate comparisons between each of the individual data sets, the time point and magnitude of the fluorescence anisotropy observed for the wt β clamp at maximum anisotropy (r = 0.202,t = 30.5 ms) and first approach to steady-state value (r = 0.155, t = 240 ms) is denoted asblack squares on the dashed lines in each of these figures. The smooth black lines through the data (gray lines) represent a global simultaneous analysis of all the data (i.e. wt, L108A, and L273A anisotropy and Pi release data) in terms of an internally consistent set of binding and cycling reactions (see “Experimental Procedures,” and described below). A few model-independent conclusions can be made by simple visual inspection of the data. In each case, the maximal anisotropy is found to precede a burst in ATP hydrolysis. This result is consistent with our previous study that revealed loading reactions could occur using non-hydrolyzable ATPγS (16Bertram J.G. Bloom L.B. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Beechem J.M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24564-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For wt and each of the mutants, once β and γ complex are completely loaded onto DNA, there is a rapid burst of 1 μm Pi release, representing the simultaneous hydrolysis of 2 mol of ATP for every mole of complex loaded (500 nm total concentration of p/t DNA, β, and γ complex present in these reactions).

https://openalex.org/W1983873588,"Type I allergies are immunological disorders that afflict a quarter of the world's population. Improved diagnosis of allergic diseases and the formulation of new therapeutic approaches are based on the use of recombinant allergens. We describe here for the first time the application of a rapid plant-based expression system for a plant-derived allergen and its immunological characterization. We expressed our model allergen Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen, in the tobacco-related species Nicotiana benthamiana using a tobacco mosaic virus vector. Two weeks postinoculation, plants infected with recombinant viral RNA containing the Bet v 1 coding sequence accumulated the allergen to levels of 200 microg/g leaf material. Total nonpurified protein extracts from plants were used for immunological characterizations. IgE immunoblots and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunoassay) inhibition assays showed comparable IgE binding properties for tobacco recombinant (r) Bet v 1 and natural (n) Bet v 1, suggesting that the B cell epitopes were preserved when the allergen was expressed in N. benthamiana plants. Using a murine model of type I allergy, mice immunized with crude leaf extracts containing Bet v 1 with purified rBet v 1 produced in E. coli or with birch pollen extract generated comparable allergen-specific IgE and IgG1 antibody responses and positive type I skin test reactions. These results demonstrate that nonpurified Bet v 1 overexpressed in N. benthamina has the same immunogenicity as purified Bet v 1 produced in E. coli or nBet v 1. We therefore conclude that this plant expression system offers a viable alternative to fermentation-based production of allergens in bacteria or yeasts. In addition, there may be a broad utility of this system for the development of new and low-cost vaccination strategies against allergy."

Although the importance of understanding the PriA protein interactions with a nucleic acid has been recognized, little is known about the quantitative aspects of these interactions. Nothing is known about the stoichiometry, i.e. the total site-size of the PriA·ssDNA complexes with different ss- and dsDNAs, base specificity, effect of solution conditions on the intrinsic affinity, the cooperativity of the binding process, and the structure of the complexes. Knowledge of the stoichiometry and structure of the helicase-nucleic acid complex and the mechanism of binding is a prerequisite for formulating any model of the mechanism of enzyme functioning in DNA replication (17Lohman T.M.

In this communication, we report, for the first time, quantitative analyses of the interactions of the PriA helicase with a ssDNA, using the quantitative fluorescence titration technique. We present evidence that the helicase binds the ssDNA as a monomer with the total site-size of the protein·ssDNA complex n = 20 ± 3 nucleotide residues. However, studies with a series of short oligomers indicate that the ssDNA-binding site on the enzyme, directly engaged in interactions with the nucleic acid, encompasses only 8 ± 1 nucleotide residues, significantly less than the total site-size of the complex. The obtained results indicate that the enzyme has a single ssDNA-binding site, located in the central part of the protein molecule, with the protein matrix protruding over a distance of 6 ± 1 nucleotide residues on both sides of the ssDNA-binding site. The data show the binding of PriA to the ssDNA is not accompanied by any significant cooperative interactions. All solutions were made with distilled and deionized >18 megohms (Milli-Q Plus) water.

All steady-state fluorescence titrations were performed using SLM-Aminco 48000S or 8100 spectrofluorometers. In order to avoid possible artifacts, due to the fluorescence anisotropy of the sample, polarizers were placed in excitation and emission channels and set at 90 and 55° (magic angle), respectively (28Ledneva R.K.

The binding was followed by monitoring the fluorescence of the etheno derivatives of the nucleic acids (λex = 325 nm, λem = 410 nm). Numerical fits were performed using KaleidaGraph (Synergy, PA) and Mathematica (Wolfram, IL). The relative fluorescence increase of the nucleic acid, ΔF, upon binding the PriA protein is defined by Equation1, ΔF=(Fi−Fo)FoEquation 1 where F i is the fluorescence of the nucleic acid solution at a given titration point “i,” andF o is the initial value of the fluorescence of the same solution. Fluorescence emission spectra have been corrected for the instrumental factors using the software provided by the manufacturer. In this work, we followed the binding of the PriA protein to ssDNA oligomers, by monitoring the fluorescence increase, ΔF obs, of their etheno derivatives upon the complex formation. To obtain rigorous estimates of the average degree of binding, ∑ν i (number of the bound protein molecules per ssDNA oligomer) and the free protein concentration, P F , independent of any assumption about the relationship between the observed spectroscopic signal and ∑ν i , we applied an approach previously described by us (19Bujalowski W.

Briefly, the experimentally observed ΔF obs has a contribution from each of the different possible i complexes of the PriA helicase with the ssDNA. Thus, the observed fluorescence increase is functionally related to ∑ν i by Equation 2, ΔFobs=∑viΔFi(max)Equation 2 where ΔF i (max) is the molecular parameter characterizing the maximum fluorescence increase of the nucleic acid with the PriA protein bound in complex i. The same value of ΔF obs, obtained at two different total nucleic acid concentrations, N T 1 and N T 2, indicates the same physical state of the nucleic acid, i.e. the degree of binding, ∑ν i , and the free PriA protein concentration, P F , must be the same. The value of ∑ν i and P F is then related to the total protein concentrations, P T 1and P T 2, and the total nucleic acid concentrations, N T 1 and N T 2, at the same value of ΔF obs, by Equations 3 and 4, ∑vi=(PT2−PT1)(NT2−NT1)Equation 3 PF=PTx−∑viNTxEquation 4 where x = 1 or 2 (19Bujalowski W.

Binding of the PriA helicase to the ssDNA homopolymers is not accompanied by an adequate change in the helicase fluorescence to perform quantitative analyses of the PriA-ssDNA interactions. However, we have found that formation of the complex between the enzyme and the etheno derivative of the adenosine polymer and oligomers causes a strong ∼3-fold nucleic acid fluorescence increase. Because at 325 nm (excitation wavelength) the etheno adenine is predominantly excited, the observed fluorescence increase must result from the quantum yield increase of the nucleic acid. It should be noted that incorporation of εA into the polymer induces an 8–10-fold quenching of the εA fluorescence, as compared with the free mononucleotide (36Tolman G.L. Barrio J.R. Leonard N.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4869-4878Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 37Baker B.M. Vanderkooi J. Kallenbach N.R. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1361-1372Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the strong nucleic acid fluorescence increase, when bound to the PriA helicase, indicates that some of the quenching processes have been removed in the complex with the helicase (see “Discussion”). The dramatic enhancement of the ssDNA etheno derivative fluorescence provides an excellent signal to monitor the PriA-ssDNA interactions and to perform the high resolution measurements of the stoichiometry and mechanism of the helicase·ssDNA complex formation. However, quantitative fluorescence titrations of the etheno derivative of poly(dA) and poly(dεA), with the PriA helicase, were hindered by the fact that the protein-polymer nucleic acid complex precipitates at high concentrations of the protein and the nucleic acid (data not shown). Nevertheless, these data indicate that the total site-size of the helicase·ssDNA complex, i.e. the maximum number of nucleotides occluded by the enzyme in the complex, is lower than ∼25 nucleotide residues. Therefore, to address the fundamental problem of the stoichiometry of the helicase·ssDNA complex, we performed a series of quantitative studies using several ssDNA oligomers with different numbers of nucleotide residues. Fluorescence titrations of the 24-mer, dεA(pεA)23, with the PriA protein at two different nucleic acid concentrations, in buffer C (pH 7.0, 10 °C), containing 100 mm NaCl, are shown in Fig. 1 a. At higher nucleic acid concentrations, a given relative fluorescence increase is reached at higher PriA concentrations. This increase results from the fact that, at higher DNA concentrations, more protein is required to obtain the same degree of binding, ∑ν i . The selected nucleic acid concentrations provide separation of the binding isotherms up to the relative fluorescence increase of ∼2.3. To obtain binding parameters, independent of any assumption about the relationship between the observed signal and the degree of binding, ∑ν i , the fluorescence titration curves, shown in Fig.1 a, have been analyzed, using the approach outlined under “Experimental Procedures” (19Bujalowski W.

Fig. 1 bshows the dependence of the observed relative fluorescence increase of the 24-mer as a function of the average degree of binding, ∑ν i , of the PriA helicase. Short extrapolation to the maximum fluorescence change, ΔF max = 2.8 ± 0.2, shows only one molecule of the PriA helicase binding to the 24-mer. The same 1:1 stoichiometry and the same affinities (see below) were obtained with higher and lower 24-mer concentrations providing direct thermodynamic evidence that the enzyme exists in our solution conditions predominantly as a monomer, and the monomer is the form that binds the ssDNA. This is in excellent agreement with early studies that indicated that the PriA helicase exists in solution as a monomer (7Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6794-6798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,9Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6789-6793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, using the analytical ultracentrifugation technique, we determined that the sedimentation coefficient of the enzyme,s 20, w = 5.9 ± 0.15, remains constant, within experimental accuracy, over a large protein concentration range (data not shown). These results indicate that the PriA helicase exists as a monomer in the protein concentration range studied in this work. The maximum stoichiometry of the enzyme-ssDNA oligomer is different in the case of the 30-mer, dεA(pεA)29, although this oligomer is only six nucleotide residues longer than the 24-mer. Fluorescence titrations of the dεA(pεA)29 with the PriA helicase at two different nucleic acid concentrations, in buffer C (pH 7.0, 10 °C), containing 100 mm NaCl, are shown in Fig.2 a. Separation of the titration curves allowed us to determine the average degree of binding, ∑ν i , up to ∼1.6, a value significantly higher than in the case of the 24-mer. The dependence of the relative fluorescence increase of the 30-mer, as a function of the average degree of binding of the PriA helicase on the oligomer, is shown in Fig. 2 b. Extrapolation to the maximum fluorescence increase ΔF max = 2.5 ± 0.2 provides ∑ν i = 2.2 ± 0.2. Thus, the presence of an extra six nucleotide residues in the 30-mer, as compared with the 24-mer, provides enough interaction space for the binding of the second PriA protein molecule. However, the stoichiometry of the two PriA molecules bound per ssDNA oligomer is not changed when the length of the ssDNA oligomer is further increased by an additional 10 residues. Fluorescence titrations of the 40-mer, dεA(pεA)39, with the PriA helicase at two different nucleic acid concentrations, in buffer C (pH 7.0, 10 °C), containing 100 mm NaCl, are shown in Fig.3 a. Separation of the titration curves allowed us to determine the average degree of binding, ∑ν i , up to ∼1.5. The titration at high nucleic acid concentrations could not reach a plateau because of the precipitation of the protein-nucleic acid complex at high protein and nucleic acid concentrations for this longest ssDNA oligomer studied. The dependence of the relative fluorescence increase of the 40-mer, as a function of the average degree of binding of the PriA helicase on the oligomer, is shown in Fig. 3 b. Extrapolation to the maximum fluorescence increase ΔF max = 3.5 ± 0.2 provides ∑ν i = 2 ± 0.2. Quantitative analysis of the maximum stoichiometry of PriA·ssDNA complexes has been performed for a series of ssDNA oligomers. The dependence of the maximum number of bound PriA molecules per ssDNA oligomer, determined using the approach (see “Experimental Procedures”) upon the length of the oligomer, is shown in Fig.4. Oligomers from 8 to 26 nucleotide residues bind a single PriA molecule. Transition from a single enzyme bound per oligomer to two bound protein molecules per ssDNA occurs between 26- and 30-mers (Fig. 4). However, a further increase in the length of the oligomer, up to 40 residues, does not lead to an increased number of bound PriA molecules per ssDNA oligomer. These data provide the first indication that a total site-size of the PriA·ssDNA complex is less than 24 nucleotide residues, but it must contain at least 15 nucleotide residues per bound protein molecule (see below). The total site-size of a large protein ligand-DNA complex corresponds to the DNA fragment, which includes nucleotide residues directly involved in interactions with the protein, its DNA-binding site, and the nucleotides not engaged in direct interactions (38Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. Anderson C.F. Biopolymers. 1989; 28: 1637-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 39Epstein I.R. Biophys.

The latter are prevented from interacting with another protein molecule by the protruding protein matrix of the previously bound protein molecule over nucleotides adjacent to the binding site (37Baker B.M. Vanderkooi J. Kallenbach N.R. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1361-1372Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 38Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. Anderson C.F.

This is clearly evident in the case of the PriA complexes with 8- and 26-mers (Figs. 3 and 4). Both oligomers can bind only a single enzyme molecule, yet the length of the 26-mer is more than three times longer than the length of the 8-mer. An accurate estimate of the site-size of the PriA helicase·ssDNA complex, using ssDNA oligomers, requires the evaluation of the number of nucleotide residues directly engaged in interactions with the ssDNA-binding site of the helicase. Fluorescence titrations of the dεA(pεA)13, dεA(pεA)9, dεA(pεA)7, and dεA(pεA)5 with the PriA helicase in buffer C (pH 7.0, 10 °C), containing 100 mmNaCl, are shown in Fig. 5. Titration curves of the 14-, 10-, and 8-mers show similar fluorescence increases, although slightly decreasing as the length of the nucleic acid decreases. Recall, a single molecule of the PriA helicase, binds to 14-, 10-, and 8-mers (Fig. 4). Moreover, the binding to these oligomers is characterized by very similar intrinsic affinities (TableI). A very dramatic drop in the affinity and the accompanying fluorescence increase occurs when the number of nucleotide residues is lower than eight, with the affinity of the 6-mer being beyond the quantitative analysis in our solution conditions (K ≪ 1 × 103m−1). These data clearly indicate that the number of nucleotide residues directly involved in interactions with the ssDNA-binding site of the PriA helicase, within the total site-size of the protein·ssDNA"

It has been recently shown that IL-4 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP, implicating the phosphatase in IL-4 processes.

Blood. 1991; 77: 1859-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-4 signaling is transduced via the IL-4 receptor α chain (IL-4Rα) that heterodimerizes with the common γ chain (γc) upon ligand binding, whereupon the Janus tyrosine kinases (Jaks), constitutively bound to their respective receptor chains, are activated via transphosphorylation (2Idzerda R.L.

Five conserved tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of the IL-4Rα are potential sites of phosphorylation and of subsequent interaction with downstream signaling effectors through SH2- and PTB-containing protein modules. The identification of tyrosine residues critical for activation of signaling pathways and subsequent analysis of molecules that interact with these residues have led to the biochemical characterization of pathways activated by IL-4R engagement. Accumulated evidence supports the idea that, although there appears to be some functional overlap, the IL-4Rα cytoplasmic region is segregated into distinct functional regions. The region surrounding Tyr-497 is involved primarily in proliferation and protection from apoptosis via the recruitment/activation of the adapter molecules such as insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (IRS-1/2), whereas gene activation is regulated via STAT6 recruitment/activation at one of three redundant tyrosine sites at Tyr-575, Tyr-603, or Tyr-631 (5Keegan A.D.

Although the activation of signaling from the IL-4R has been relatively well studied with the identification of proximal signaling effectors, the intracellular mechanism that limits or terminates IL-4 signaling remains less characterized. Recently, the polyphosphoinositide phosphatase SHIP has been implicated in the negative modulation of signaling initiated by a number of cytokines and other stimuli (8Rohrschneider L.R. Fuller J.F. Wolf I. Liu Y. Lucas D.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 505-520PubMed Google Scholar). SHIP was initially identified and isolated through its recruitment to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif of the FcγRIIb receptor as well as through its association with Shc in response to a number of stimuli (9Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 10D'Ambrosio D. Fong D.C. Cambier J.C. Immunol.

SHIP contains a central inositol 5′-phosphatase domain, which acts specifically on both phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-P3 and inositol-1,3,4,5-P4 (12Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K.

The central phosphatase domain is flanked by a NH2-terminal SH2 domain and a COOH-terminal containing two NPXY motifs as well as a number of interspersed proline-rich regions. The NPXY motifs mediate association with proteins such as Shc and Disabled via their respective PTB domains (14Lamkin T.D. Walk S.F. Liu L. Damen J.E. Krystal G. Ravichandran K.S. J. Biol.

SHIP has been recently implicated in IL-4 signaling by the description of IL-4-mediated SHIP phosphorylation, although its role remains to be clarified (17Zamorano J. Keegan A.D. J.

Upon cross-linking of FcγRIIb to the BCR, Ca2+ mobilization is inhibited via SHIP recruitment to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif of FcγRIIb (18Bolland S. Pearse R.N. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 1998; 8: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Studies suggest that by altering the relative composition of phosphoinositide pools, SHIP can differentially regulate membrane targeting of proteins. Indeed, an emerging picture from multiple systems suggests protein modules such as PH domains and FYVE domains bind phosphorylated inositol groups with varying specificity and thereby regulate protein localization and function (19Stenmark H. Aasland R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4175-4183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). In the case of BCR-FcγRIIb signaling, levels of PIP3 are the critical regulators of Ca2+signaling at least in part by their ability to support the activation of the PH domain containing Tec family kinases which activate phospholipase Cγ2 and subsequent inositol-1,4,5-P3production (21Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 22Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). SHIP inhibits Ca2+ mobilization by reducing the recruitment and thereby activation of the Tec kinases to the plasma membrane via shifting the PI pool away from PIP3. In a similar fashion, studies suggest that SHIP also negatively regulates activation of the PH-containing serine/threonine kinase, Akt, in response to FcγRIIb-BCR cross-linking and IL-3 stimulation in myeloid cells through the presumed negative modulation of membrane targeting (23Liu Q. Sasaki T. Kozieradzki I. Wakeham A. Itie A. Dumont D.J. Penninger J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 24Aman M.J. Lamkin T.D. Okada H. Kurosaki T. Ravichandran K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33922-33928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is likely that along with reduction in PIP3 mediated by SHIP, the concomitant increase in PI(3,4)P2 may in turn increase the membrane targeting of other yet identified proteins that preferentially bind PI(3,4)P2. Thus SHIP may lead to the shuttling of various proteins in and out of membrane compartments based at least partially on their lipid binding specificity. All reports to date have suggested that SHIP performs a negative regulatory role in cytokine signaling. Elucidation of the role of SHIPin vivo has been aided by the analysis of SHIP homozygous null mice (25Helgason C.D. Damen J.E. Rosten P. Grewal R. Sorensen P. Chappel S.M. Borowski A. Jirik F. Krystal G. Humphries R.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1610-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Hematopoietic stem cells from SHIP(−/−) mice displayed increased colony formation in response to IL-3, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and steel factor, suggesting that SHIP acts as a negative regulator of either proliferation and/or survival in response to these particular cytokines. Interestingly, SHIP(−/−) mice display decreased survival secondary to lung infiltration from cells of the myeloid and granulocytic compartment correlating with increased colony formation observed in response to this subset of cytokines. Conversely, analysis of other cellular compartments suggests that SHIP may not solely act as a negative regulator but potentially may serve other functions. In support of this notion, the null mice exhibit decreased bone marrow cellularity and a substantial reduction in pre-B cells with a concomitant reduction in peripheral B cells (25Helgason C.D. Damen J.E. Rosten P. Grewal R. Sorensen P. Chappel S.M. Borowski A. Jirik F. Krystal G. Humphries R.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1610-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 26Liu Q. Oliveira-Dos-Santos A.J. Mariathasan S. Bouchard D. Jones J. Sarao R. Kozieradzki I. Ohashi P.S. Penninger J.M. Dumont D.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1333-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This observation suggests a potential positive role for SHIP. In addition, SHIP recruitment attenuates FcγRIIb-induced B cell apoptosis via an unclear mechanism, independent of its inhibitory effect on Ca2+ mobilization (27Pearse R.N. Kawabe T. Bolland S. Guinamard R. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 1999; 10: 753-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This latter result suggests SHIP may differentially effect signals emanating from the same receptor, acting as inhibitor on the one hand or as a positive regulator on the other, depending on the signaling pathways examined. The role of SHIP in cytokine signaling has been addressed by utilizing overexpression studies of wild type SHIP and/or by analysis of knockout mice. However, it remains unclear what effect, if any, the catalytic activity of SHIP domain contributes to these observations. For example, the ability of SHIP to interact with Shc has been proposed to allow SHIP to sequester Shc from Grb2 and thereby reduce Ras signaling, allowing SHIP to inhibit signaling independently of its catalytic activity in some systems (28Tridandapani S. Phee H. Shivakumar L. Kelley T.W. Coggeshall K.M. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 1135-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Ingham R.J. Okada H. Dang-Lawson M. Dinglasan J. van Der Geer P.

Therefore, the relative contribution of the catalytic activity of SHIP in relation to its other domains may vary upon the signaling pathway and cell type. In this report, we focus on the potential role of the catalytic activity of SHIP in IL-4 signaling. In order to gain insights into possible mechanisms of SHIP action, we have begun to establish the structural arrangement of SHIP within the IL-4 receptor signaling complex. In doing so, we have implicated Jak1 in SHIP regulation in vivo. Analysis of IL-4-mediated proliferation in cells overexpressing different forms of SHIP demonstrates a novel positive regulatory role for the catalytic activity of SHIP. This regulation correlates with an alteration in PIP3 levels but surprisingly not with an alteration in Akt, STAT6, IRS-2, or p70S6k activation. These results point to a positive regulatory role of the catalytic activity of SHIP and identify SHIP as a potentially key modulator of IL-4 responses. 32D myeloid cells stably expressing IRS-2 (32D/IRS-2, kindly provided by Dr. J. Pierce, National Institutes of Health, Betheseda) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 50 μmβ-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad), and 5% WEHI-3-conditioned medium as a source of IL-3. 293T cells and Phoenix cells (a gift from Dr. Garry Nolan, Stanford University), a derivative of the 293T cell line, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine. Antibodies against phosphotyrosine (4G10), Jak1, Jak3, p85, and IRS-2 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal anti-SHIP antibody was as described previously (31Tridandapani S. Kelley T. Pradhan M. Cooney D. Justement L.B. Coggeshall K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Antibodies against pan-Akt or phosphospecific (S473) Akt as well pan-p70S6k or phosphospecific (Thr-389) p70S6k were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). To generate the retrovirus-based expression plasmids for wild type SHIP(WT) and phosphatase-inactive mutant SHIP(D672A) (32Jacob A. Cooney D. Tridandapani S. Kelley T. Coggeshall K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13704-13710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the cDNAs encoding for these SHIP were subcloned into the retroviral vector MSCV-pIRES-GFP (a kind gift of Dr. G. Nolan, Stanford University, CA), which is an internal ribosome entry site bicistronic expression vector allowing concomitant expression of both SHIP and GFP protein. Myc-tagged SHIP constructs were generated by subcloning the coding region of SHIP cDNA into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Wild type and kinase inactive mutants of Jak1 and Jak3 were also subcloned into pcDNA3.1. Transient transfection of 293T cells was performed by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. Retroviruses were generated by transient transfection of retroviral DNA into amphotropic packaging cell line Phoenix by use of the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. Supernatant-containing viruses were collected at 48 h after transfection. Viral stocks were stored at −80 °C until used or were used immediately for infection. After expansion of infected cells, GFP-positive cells were sorted by FACS (FACStar, Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting after sorting. 32D/IRS-2 cells were washed and resuspended in starvation medium containing RPMI 1640 medium, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0% fetal calf serum for 4 h at 37 °C and then incubated in the presence or absence of murine IL-4 (10 ng/ml) or IL-3 (5% WEHI-3-conditioned medium). Preparation of cell lysates, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting were performed as described previously (33Liu L. Damen J.E. Hughes M.R. Babic I. Jirik F.R. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8983-8988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). 32D/IRS-2 cell lines were grown in complete RPMI 1640 medium and 5% WEHI-3-conditioned media 3 days prior to experiment. On the day of the experiment, cells were washed 3 times with complete RPMI 1640 without 5% WEHI-3-conditioned media and seeded at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells per 200 μl in plate in complete RPMI 1640 with varying concentrations of recombinant murine IL-4 or 5% WEHI-3 conditioned medium in triplicate. One μCi of [3H]thymidine (NEN Life Science Products) was added 40 h after stimulation followed by incubation for 8 h before analysis. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was measured by a scintillation counter. 32D/IRS-2 cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 and 5% WEHI-3-conditioned media for 3 days prior to the experiment. On the day of the experiment, cells were washed 3 times with complete RPMI 1640 without 5% WEHI-3-conditioned media or serum. Cells were cultured at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells per 200 μl in a 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plate in culture media with varying concentrations of recombinant murine IL-4 (0, 1, 10 ng/ml) in triplicate for 0, 24, and 48 h. For each condition, the number of trypan blue-positive cells per total of 100 were counted as a measure of cell death. The standard deviation of the triplicate per condition was calculated and expressed as the error bar per condition. One of three representative experiments is shown. A second method to analyze cell death/viability was also performed, data not shown. Cells were prepared as in method one and then stimulated with murine IL-4 at 10 ng/ml or 5% WEHI-3-conditioned medium for a total of 24 h. After 24 h of cytokine stimulation, aliquots of cells were harvested and analyzed by Annexin-V-PE and PI staining analyzed by FACStar. The percentage of viable cells was calculated as the number of Annexin-V and PI double negative staining cells divided by the total number of cells analyzed (10,000). 32D/IRS-2 cells were IL-3-starved overnight and then washed with phosphate-free minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by incubation in the presence of 50 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (NEN Life Science Products) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 6 h. After stimulation with IL-4, 500 μl of ice-cold mixture of 1 n HCl/methanol (1:1) was added and vigorously vortexed. The lipids in organic phase were extracted 3 times with chloroform and washed with ice-cold mixture of 1 n HCl/methanol (1:1) before drying. Dried lipids were resolved by thin layer chromatography in chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/H2O (46:17:15:14:8). Ligand-induced dimerization of the IL-4Rα chain leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of five conserved tyrosines (Tyr-497, Tyr-575, Tyr-603, Tyr-631, and Tyr-713) within its cytoplasmic tail. These sites can thereafter act as docking centers for downstream effector molecules such as STAT6 (Tyr-575, Tyr-603, Tyr-631), IRS-1/2 (Tyr-497), Shc (Tyr-497), and Dok1/2 (Tyr-497) (34Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). In the murine myeloid cell line 32D, which expresses IRS-1, SHIP is tyrosine-phosphorylated independently of Tyr-497, which lies within an NPXY motif of the IL-4Rα chain (17Zamorano J. Keegan A.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 859-867PubMed Google Scholar). Upon tyrosine phosphorylation, Tyr-497 is both necessary and sufficient for IRS-1/2 and Shc recruitment to the IL-4Rα chain via their respective PTB domains and thereafter subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that IRS-1/2 and Shc are not required for SHIP phosphorylation (17Zamorano J. Keegan A.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 859-867PubMed Google Scholar). We find that SHIP tyrosine phosphorylation occurs in 32D cells lacking both IRS-1 and IRS-2 (Fig. 1). This result suggests that IRS-1/2 and thereby Tyr-497 are dispensable for SHIP recruitment to the IL-4Rα signaling complex. To investigate the functional importance of SHIP in IL-4 signaling, we generated stable transformants of 32D/IRS-2 cells expressing wild type SHIP(WT) or phosphatase-inactive SHIP (D672A), which has a point mutation Asp to Ala in the putative phosphatase active site aspartate at position 672. This mutation is reported to render the protein catalytically (32Jacob A. Cooney D. Tridandapani S. Kelley T. Coggeshall K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13704-13710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In order to establish these stable cell lines, retroviral expression plasmids containing GFP with/without SHIP(WT) or SHIP(D672A) (Fig.2 A) were transfected into amphotropic packaging cell line Phoenix, and supernatants from these cells were used for viral infection of 32D/IRS-2. After the repeated sorting by GFP, the expression of SHIP was examined by FACScan (Fig.2 B) and Western blotting (Fig. 2 C). By using this method, we established independent polyclonal cell lines expressing SHIP(WT) or SHIP(D672A). A representative cell line expresses the ectopically expressed proteins ∼5-fold higher than the endogenous SHIP protein (Fig. 2 C). Previously, it has been shown that PIP3 level is elevated by PI 3-kinase (PI3-K) in response to IL-4 stimulation (35Gold M.R. Duronio V. Saxena S.P. Schrader J.W. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5403-5412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SHIP specifically removes the 5′-phosphate from PIP3, as well as inositol 1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate in vitro (12Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold A. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 13Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SHIP(−/−) null mice appear to have increased levels of PIP3 in response to IL-3, suggesting that SHIP in vivo acts downstream of PI3-K to negatively modulate PIP3 levels (23Liu Q. Sasaki T. Kozieradzki I. Wakeham A. Itie A. Dumont D.J. Penninger J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We, therefore, sought to determine whether overexpression of either SHIP(WT) or SHIP(D672A) would be capable of altering PIP3 levels upon IL-4 stimulationin vivo. In vector alone cells, PIP3 is induced upon IL-4 treatment (Fig. 3). In cells overexpressing SHIP(WT), IL-4-induced levels of PIP3 are significantly reduced, consistent with the ability of SHIP to dephosphorylate the 5′-position of PIP3 thereby reducing its levels. In contrast, induction of PIP3 is greater in cells overexpressing SHIP(D672A) when compared with vector alone cells. Furthermore, the PI3-K inhibitor wortmannin blocked the IL-4-induced increase in PIP3 production in SHIP(D672) cells, suggesting that the catalytic activity of SHIP lies downstream of PI3-K. Taken together, these results suggest an important role for SHIP in regulating PIP3 levels upon IL-4-mediated PI3-K activation. SHIP has been shown to be a negative regulator of cellular growth induced by several receptor signaling complexes (8Rohrschneider L.R. Fuller J.F. Wolf I. Liu Y. Lucas D.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 505-520PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the role of SHIP in regulating IL-4-induced proliferation, cells were starved from IL-3 and then cultured with the various concentrations of IL-4 for 48 h. Proliferation of these cells was then examined by [3H]thymidine incorporation. SHIP(WT) cells exhibited greater proliferation in response to IL-4 stimulation when compared with vector alone cells over a range of concentrations (Fig. 4 A). In striking contrast, the proliferative response to IL-4 was suppressed in cells overexpressing SHIP(D672A) when compared with control cells (Fig.4 A). These results indicate that the increased proliferation observed in SHIP(WT) cells is not secondary to nonspecific protein-protein interactions mediated by SHIP protein overexpression but rather requires the catalytic activity of SHIP. Similar effects on cellular proliferation by SHIP in 32D/IRS-2 cells were observed in other sets of independently generated stable cell lines (data not shown). To determine if SHIP also affected the growth of these same cells in response to IL-3, thymidine incorporation was measured in cells grown in 5% WEHI-3-conditioned media. A previous study utilizing the IL-3-dependent cell line DE-AR revealed that overexpression of wild type SHIP had no effect on cell number (33Liu L. Damen J.E. Hughes M.R. Babic I. Jirik F.R. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8983-8988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In agreement with this report, there was no effect on proliferation of 32D/IRS-2 cells overexpressing SHIP(WT) or SHIP(D672A) at least at the concentration measured (Fig. 4 A). These results suggest that the catalytic activity of SHIP functions as a positive regulator of IL-4-mediated proliferation. This effect correlates with a reduced level of PIP3 (Fig. 3). In addition, the positive role for SHIP catalytic activity with respect to proliferation appears to be specific for IL-4. The observed differences in thymidine incorporation data above may have been explained by a differential effect on cell survival among cells overexpressing of SHIP(WT) versus SHIP(D672A). This is unlikely based on two independent observations. First, an analysis of cell death over 0, 24, or 48 h of either 0, 1, or 10 ng/ml of IL-4 stimulation was performed comparing vector alone cells, SHIP(WT)-, and SHIP(D672A)-expressing cells. No significant differences in cell viability as measured by trypan blue staining was observed over 48 h among the these SHIP-expressing cells under varying amounts of IL-4 (Fig. 4 B). Second, utilizing Annexin-V and PI staining to detect apoptotic cells, at 0 and 24 h of constant IL-4 stimulation at 10 ng/ml there is no difference in the level of apoptosis among the different SHIP-expressing cells (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the observed differences in proliferation between SHIP(WT) and SHIP(D672A) was not the result of differences in the rate of cell death among the these cells in the setting of constant IL-4 stimulation or upon withdrawal of IL-3. In order to gain insight into the mechanism by which SHIP alters IL-4-induced proliferation, the activation of known components of IL-4 signaling were examined. In 32D cells, IRS-1 and IRS-2 in particular have been shown to be critical for IL-4-mediated proliferation (5Keegan A.D. Nelms K. White M. Wang L.M. Pierce J.H. Paul W.E.

RNA. 1999; 6: 163-169Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar), suggesting that trans-splicing co-exists with cis-splicing in nature as in nematodes andEuglena (5Nilsen T.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 413-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It is currently unknown how the trypanosome SL RNA in its ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, SL RNP, is brought into the spliceosome to associate with the pre-mRNA. In nematodes, U6 snRNA was demonstrated to play a major role in bridging the SL RNA by interacting with the Sm-binding site and adjacent four 3′ nts (6Hannon G.J. Maroney P.A., Yu, Y.-T. Hannon G.E. Nilsen T.W. Science. 1992; 258: 1775-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Based on in vitro studies, it was also shown that the nematode SL sequence is not essential for splicing, and only the intron portion is crucial for SL RNA function (7Maroney P.A. Hannon G., J. Shambaugh J.D. Nilsen T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3869-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The mechanisms operating in trypanosomatids are not yet clear. All of the studies to date have been performed in vivo, because trans-splicing has not yet been reconstituted in vitro. In Leptomonas seymouri, major portions of the SL sequence were shown to be essential for trans-splicing (8Lücke S. Xu G.-L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas inLeishmania tarentolae, substitutions across the entire exon did not alter splicing (9Sturm N.C. Fleischmannn J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Discrepancies exist regarding the importance of the primary sequence of SL in splicing though agreement exists regarding the importance of the exon size. The exon cannot tolerate any size change in the trypanosomatid systems examined (8Lücke S. Xu G.-L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Sturm N.C. Fleischmannn J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Goncharov I. Xu Y.-X. Zimmer Y. Sherman K. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2200-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Major differences were also observed in various species in the function of SL RNA intron. In L. seymouri, mutations in stem-loops II and III and the Sm-binding site but not deletion of stem-loop II still allowed trans-splicing (8Lücke S. Xu G.-L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Different results were obtained in L. tarentolae, and they suggest that specific sequences in stem-loop II, the Sm-binding site, and stem-loop III are important for proper methylation of the cap 4 structure and trans-splicing (11Sturm N.C. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19361-19367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Studies inLeptomonas collosoma demonstrate that the loops of stem-loops II and III were tolerant to insertions; however, chimeric SL RNA mutant carrying the L. collosoma exon and the T. brucei intron was inactive in trans-splicing (10Goncharov I. Xu Y.-X. Zimmer Y. Sherman K. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2200-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These contradictory results may stem from the following points: 1) the differences in the model, tagged SL RNA molecules, which were used as the parental construct to examine the phenotype of secondary site mutations; and 2) the level of expression of the mutated SL RNA relative to the wild-type transcripts. Elucidating the complex SL-snRNA interactions is the key to understand how SL RNA is brought into the spliceosome. In vivocross-linking data suggest that two small RNAs, the spliced leader-associated RNA (SLA1) and U5 snRNA, may participate in this process (12Watkins K.P. Dungan J.M. Agabian N. Cell. 1994; 76: 171-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Dungan J.D. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4016-4029Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The location of the cross-links of T. brucei U5 RNA with SL RNA enables alignment of these sequences exactly as in cis-splicing. Based on the data, it was proposed that SL RNA interacts with the U5 by extensive base pairing involving sequences from both intron and exon of SL RNA (13Dungan J.D. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4016-4029Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The proposed interaction between the U5 and SL RNA intron is novel because in cis-splicing, the U5 invariant loop was shown to exclusively interact with exon sequences (14Newman A., J. Norman C. Cell. 1992; 68: 743-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Interestingly, analysis of L. collosoma SL-U5 interactions suggested that the extended potential is phylogenetically conserved only at the region located downstream from the 5′ splice site (SS) (15Xu Y.-X. Ben Shlomo H. Michaeli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As opposed to U5, SLA1 seems specific to trypanosomatids and its potential to interact with SL exon is conserved among all of the trypanosomatids and is situated at positions from –4 to –10 of the exon region (13Dungan J.D. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4016-4029Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Roberts T.G. Dungan J.M. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SLA1 seems to be a trans-splicing specific small RNA because, like all trypanosome spliceosomal small nuclear RNPs, it associates with a set of core proteins (17Palfi Z. Xu G.L. Bindereif A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30620-30625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from the cross-linking data, there is currently no other evidence supporting the function of U5 and SLA1 in trans-splicing. One of the most important base pair interactions that take place just before the first step of cis-splicing reaction is the interaction between positions from +4 to +6 of the intron and ACA of the hexanucleotide of U6 snRNA (18Lesser C.F. Guthrie C. Science. 1993; 262: 1982-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). An analogous interaction was proposed to occur in trypanosomatid trans-splicing, because in Crithidia fasciculata, a change at the second position of the U6 hexanucleotide is compensated by the mutation at the highly conserved 5′ SS position +5 (19Xu G.-L. Wieland B. Bindereif A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4565-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Interestingly, as in nematodes, the trypanosomatid SL RNA may have the potential to interact with the U6 RNA downstream from the Sm-site (20Goldring A. Michaeli S. Gene. 1995; 156: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined at the genetic level the proposed base pair interactions between the U5 and U6 snRNAs across the 5′ SS region of SL RNA. Single-base substitutions were introduced in all SL RNA positions that were proposed to interact with both U5 and U6 snRNAs by base pairing. Defects were observed for almost all positions except +4, suggesting the importance of both intron and exon sequences adjacent to 5′ SS for trans-splicing. Compensatory mutations were introduced in U5 and U6 snRNAs to suppress the defects. The intron +2 position, which had the most severe splicing phenotype of all of the mutants, was not suppressed by a corresponding U5 mutation. However, clear suppression was observed with U5 for mutations at positions +5 and +7/+8, and with U6 for mutation at position +5. The failure to suppress the other SL RNA mutations may suggest that these strategic positions interact with other RNA or protein factor(s). The oligonucleotides for SL RNA were as follows (21Goldring A. Karchi M. Michaeli S. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 80: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar): 9825, 5′-GCCCGAAAGCTCGGTC-3′, antisense complementary to positions 88–103 of SL RNA gene; 11837, 5′-GAAAGCTCGGTAGGATCCGCTCCAAAATTT-3′, antisense to generate Sm-site mutation complementary to positions 80–99 withBamHI site insertion (underlined); 18528, 5′-GGAAGTCTTGACATACCAAT-3′, antisense to generate +7/+8 mutation complementary to positions 38–57 carrying 2-base substitutions (CT to TG, underlined) at positions 48 and 49; 21620, 5′-ACATACCAAGGAAGTACAGA-3′, antisense to generate –4 mutation complementary to positions 28–48 with T to G transversion at position 38; 21622, 5′-CTCTACATATCAATGAAGTA-3′, antisense to generate +1 mutation complementary to positions 32–51 with C to T transition at position 42; 21624, 5′-TCTACATACGAATGAAGTAC-3′, antisense to generate –1 mutation complementary to positions 31–50 with C to G transversion at 41; 21626, 5′-TCTCTACATGCCAATGAAGT-3′, antisense to generate +2 mutation complementary to positions 33–52 with A to G at 43; 22266, 5′-ACCAATGAAGTATAGAAACTGTT-3′, antisense to generate a G-31 to A mutation in the exon complementary to positions 21–43 with C to T transition at 31; 22478, 5′-GGAAGTCTCTACCTACCAATGAAG-3′, antisense to generate +4 mutation complementary to positions 34–57 with A to C transversion at 45; 22479, 5′-GGAAGTCTCTATATACCAATGAAG-3′, antisense to generate +5 mutation complementary to positions 34–57 with C to G transversion at 46; 24389, 5′-ACATACCAAGGAAGTATAGA-3′, antisense to generate –4 mutation complementary to positions 28–48 with 2-base substitutions, C to T transition at position 31, and T to G transversion at position 38; 24390, 5′-TCTACATACGAATGAAGTAT-3′, antisense to generate –1 mutation complementary to positions 31–50 with C to T transition at 31 and C to G transversion at 41; 21995, 5′-GAGGGAGGAATGAGGTGAGC-3′ complementary to neo/hygro mRNA complementary to positions –1 to +19 (positions 4996–5016 of the pX vector) (22Kapler G.M.

The oligonucleotides for U6 snRNA (20Goldring A. Michaeli S. Gene. 1995; 156: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were as follows: 23049, 5′-AATCTTCTCTCTTGAAGTTCCA-3′, antisense to compensate for the SL RNA mutation at position +5 complementary to positions 29–50 with G to C transversion at 40; 23051, 5′-GCTCTAGAGTCAAAGGGGCAAGACTTAA-3′, sense upstream from U6 gene to positions –411 to –392 containing XbaI site (underlined); and 23052, 5′-GCTCTAGAGGGAACCCGCACACAAGCCG-3′, antisense complementary to positions 93–112 containing XbaI site. The oligonucleotide for U2 snRNA (23Hartshorne T. Agabian N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2121-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was as follows: 25327, 5′-GATCAAAGATTTCGTATTCC-3′, antisense complementary to positions 84–103 of the L. collosoma U2 RNA. L. collosoma cells were grown as described previously (21Goldring A. Karchi M. Michaeli S. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 80: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cultures were harvested at log phase and total RNA was prepared with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the supplier's protocol. Poly(A+) RNA was prepared as described previously (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Site-direct mutagenesis for SL RNA was carried out according to Kunkel (25Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar). The SmaI fragment (590 nts) of L. collosoma SL RNA gene in pBluescript KS (+) was used as the template (21Goldring A. Karchi M. Michaeli S. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 80: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The mutant SL RNA gene was further subcloned intoSmaI site of pX-hygro expression vector that confers resistance to hygromycin. The mutant U5 and U6 snRNA genes were generated by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis using primers carrying the mutation and oligonucleotides from the upstream and downstream of the snRNA genes. The mutated U5 and U6 genes were subcloned into BamHI and XbaI sites of the pX-neo expression vector, respectively, which confers resistance to neomycin. The construct containing both the U5 mutation (position 17, C to G) and the U6 mutation (position 40, C to G) was generated by subcloning the mutated genes into two expression sites of the same pX-neo vector. The mutations in SL RNA and the U5 and U6 genes were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Stable cell lines carrying the different mutant SL RNA constructs were established as described previously (27Goldring A. Zimmer Y. Ben-Yehuda E. Goncharov I. Michaeli S. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 84: 28-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The cell lines carrying compensatory mutations were generated by first transfecting the SL RNA mutations and selecting with hygromycin (Calbiochem). The established cell lines were subsequently transfected with the U5 or/and U6 constructs and selected with G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA samples (5 μg) were fractionated on a 10% polyacrylamide-7 m urea denaturing gel and electroblotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization with labeled oligonucleotides was performed at 42 °C in 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Primer extension was performed using end-labeled oligonucleotide (100,000 cpm/pmol). After annealing at 60 °C for 15 min, the sample was kept on ice for 1 min, 1 unit of reverse transcriptase (Expand RT, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1 unit of RNase inhibitor (Promega) were added, and extension was performed at 42 °C for 90 min. The reaction was analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gel next to DNA sequencing reaction performed with the same primer. The poisoning primer extension used for examining the utilization of mutated SL RNA in trans-splicing and for determining the expression of the mutated U5 snRNA was performed as described above, but containing ddCTP instead of dCTP in the reaction mixture. The reaction was analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. To examine the validity of the proposed interaction between the SL and U5 RNAs (13Dungan J.D. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4016-4029Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Xu Y.-X. Ben Shlomo H. Michaeli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we have mutated each of the positions on SL RNA that were proposed to interact with U5 by base pairing as indicated in Fig.1 B. The parental gene that we used was tagged with a 8-bp insertion in loop II of the intron (Fig.1 A) (10Goncharov I. Xu Y.-X. Zimmer Y. Sherman K. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2200-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The mutated SL RNA genes were subcloned into pX-hygro expression vector, and the individual cell lines were generated by selection with hygromycin. The expression of the mutants was detected by Northern analysis (Fig.2 A). The ratio between the levels of mutant and wild-type SL RNAs was quantified by densitometric analysis (Fig. 3 B, a). All mutants were highly expressed at levels either comparable to or higher than the wild-type RNA. In some cases, such as the parental loop II insertion and the mutations at positions –1, +4, and +7/+8, the expression level of the mutant SL RNA was higher than the wild-type, and the gene carried on the plasmid even repressed the synthesis of the wild-type RNA. These results are reminiscent of those obtained inL. seymouri, in which expression of the tagged SL RNA was at levels comparable to the wild-type SL RNA (8Lücke S. Xu G.-L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and are different from those obtained in L. tarentolae, in which the mutated SL RNA was only 2–6% of the wild-type (9Sturm N.C. Fleischmannn J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is currently unknown which factors dictate the high level expression in L. collosomaapart from the fact that the gene is flanked by 400 bp of upstream sequence compared with ∼90 bp in the cases of Leishmaniaand L. seymouri (8Lücke S. Xu G.-L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Sturm N.C. Fleischmannn J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol.

The adjusted values are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to determine the utilization of the mutant SL RNAs in the first step of splicing, poly(A+) RNA was prepared from each mutant cell line, because it was previously reported that the Y structure intermediates are enriched in poly(A+) RNA fraction (28Murphy W.J. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. Cell. 1986; 47: 517-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 29Sutton R.E. Boothroyd J.C. Cell. 1986; 47: 527-535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we examined the formation of Y structure using total RNA, and the same results were obtained (results not shown). Primer extension was performed on poly(A+) RNA using an oligonucleotide complementary to the 3′ end of SL RNA. The results were analyzed alongside a DNA sequencing ladder of the SL RNA gene (with loop II insertion) with the same oligonucleotide. Four primer extension products were observed, representing terminations at the 5′ ends of the wild-type and tagged SL RNAs and branched sites of wild-type and tagged Y structure intermediates, and the tagged RNAs were 8 nt longer than the wild-type RNAs (Fig. 3 A). All of the mutated SL RNAs were properly capped except for the mutation introduced at the Sm-site of SL RNA, because the staggered pattern of the primer extension on the mutated SL RNA was identical to that of the wild-type (Fig. 3 A). As indicated in Fig. 1 A, the Sm mutation extends the single-stranded region between stem-loops II and III, as well as possibly disrupting the potential for base pair interaction between the SL RNA and the U6 snRNA (20Goldring A. Michaeli S. Gene. 1995; 156: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All SL RNA mutants, except the Sm-site mutant, underwent the first step of splicing as shown by the formation of the branched intermediates, albeit at different levels (Fig. 3 A). The Sm-site mutant is so far the only one we have isolated that completely abolished the first step of splicing. To quantitate the utilization of these mutants in splicing, the ratio of the mutant to wild-type Y structure intermediate (Fig. 3 A) and the ratio of expression for mutant and wild-type SL RNA based on Northern analysis (Fig.2 A) were determined (Fig. 3 B). Using such quantitation, the actual utilization in splicing could be calculated by taking into account the differential expression of the SL RNA mutants. These results are marked as the adjusted values in Fig.3 B. Different phenotypes were observed: 1) splicing was not affected in the mutation at position +1; 2) splicing was affected due to the reduction of the level of the mutated Y structure intermediate as could be observed for mutations at positions –4, –1, and +4 (54, 51, and 42% of splicing compared with the wild-type, respectively) (a dramatic effect was found in the mutation of +2 position, which is only 37% of the wild-type SL RNA); and 3) splicing was affected resulting in the elevation of the Y structure intermediate. The latter phenotype was found at positions +5 and +7/+8 (300 and 120% of the wild-type respectively). The high level of the Y structure intermediates in these cell lines was not related to the high expression of these mutants (Fig. 2 A). Such a phenotype could stem either from very efficient utilization of the substrates in splicing or, in contrast, from a specific defect in the second step of splicing leading to the accumulation of the Y structure intermediates. The phenotype of the +1 mutation was very surprising because the invariant +1 position was shown to severely affect the first step of splicing in both mammals and yeast (30Aebi M. Hornig H. Padgett R.A. Reiser J. Weissmann C. Cell. 1986; 47: 555-565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 31Parker P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1985; 41: 107-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 32Newman A. Lin R.J. Cheng S.C. Abelson J. Cell. 1985; 42: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, the mutation at +2 position in this study had the most severe effect of all of the mutations across the 5′ SS, which is different from the phenotype of this mutation incis-splicing. The assay presented in Fig. 3 can only detect defects in the first step of splicing, and in order to investigate the effect that these mutations may have on the second step of splicing, we generated a double-mutated SL RNA that carries both an insertion in stem-loop II and a single-base substitution at position 31 of the exon (G-31 to A) (Fig.1 A). Because this mutant is also tagged in the exon, it enabled us to determine the overall utilization of this mutated SL RNA in trans-splicing by examining the formation of mature mRNA carrying the tag. Defects detected by this assay could result from defects in the first and/or second step of splicing. Specific defects in the second step of splicing can be revealed by determining the utilization of this double mutant intrans-splicing and taking into account the utilization in the first step of splicing (as described in Fig. 3). The same mutations as described in Fig. 1 B were introduced into the double-mutated SL RNA. The level of the different SL RNA mutants was examined by Northern analysis presented in Fig.4 A. The results indicate that the expression of the mutated SL RNAs was at levels that were either comparable to or higher than the wild-type SL RNA, as observed in Figs.4 A and 5 C, a. The exceptional case was the mutation at position +4, which was so highly expressed that it repressed the synthesis of wild-type SL RNA.Figure 5Primer extension analyses to determine the utilization of the mutant SL RNAs intrans-splicing.

https://openalex.org/W2059566750,"A fluorescent derivative of a chimeric toxin between human pro-urokinase and the plant ribosome-inactivating protein saporin (p-uPA-Sap(TRITC)), has been prepared in order to study the endocytosis of this potentially antimetastatic conjugate in the murine model cell line LB6 clone19 (Cl19) transfected with the human urokinase receptor gene. The physiological internalization of urokinase-inhibitor complexes is triggered by the interaction of plasminogen inhibitors (PAIs) with receptors belonging to the low density lipoprotein-related receptor protein (LRP) family, and involves a macro-quaternary structure including uPAR, LRP, and PAIs. However, in contrast to this mechanism, we observed a two-step process: first, the urokinase receptor (uPAR) acts as the anchoring factor on the plasma membrane; subsequently, LRP acts as the endocytic trigger. Once the chimera is bound to the plasma membrane by interaction with uPAR, we suggest that a possible exchange may occur to transfer the toxin to LRP via the saporin moiety and begin the internalization. So an unusual endocytic process is described, where the toxin enters the cell via a receptor different from that used to bind the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2015557817,"Stabilization of the T and R allosteric states ofEscherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase is governed by specific intra- and interchain interactions. The six interchain interactions between Glu-239 in one catalytic chain of one catalytic trimer with both Lys-164 and Tyr-165 of a different catalytic chain in the other catalytic trimer have been shown to be involved in the stabilization of the T state. In this study a series of hybrid versions of aspartate transcarbamoylase was studied to determine the minimum number of these Glu-239 interactions necessary to maintain homotropic cooperativity and the T allosteric state. Hybrids with zero, one, and two Glu-239 stabilizing interactions do not exhibit cooperativity, whereas the hybrids with three or more Glu-239 stabilizing interactions exhibit cooperativity. The hybrid enzymes with one or more of the Glu-239 stabilizing interactions also exhibit heterotropic interactions. Two hybrids with three Glu-239 stabilizing interactions, in different geometric relationships, had identical properties. From this and previous studies, it is concluded that the 239 stabilizing interactions play a critical role in the manifestation of homotropic cooperativity in aspartate transcarbamoylase by the stabilization of the T state of the enzyme. As substrate binding energy is utilized, more and more of the T state stabilizing interactions are relaxed, and finally the enzyme shifts to the R state. In the case of the Glu-239 stabilizing interactions more than three of the interactions must be broken before the enzyme shifts to the R state. The interactions between the catalytic and regulatory chains and between the two catalytic trimers of aspartate transcarbamoylase provide a global set of interlocking interactions that stabilize the T and R states of the enzyme. The substrate-induced local conformational changes observed in the structure of the isolated catalytic subunit drive the quaternary T to R transition of aspartate transcarbamoylase and functionally induced homotropic cooperativity.

Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar). The two states may differ on the quaternary level due to differences in the relative positions of subunits with respect to each other. Interface contacts may undergo significant changes during the T to R state transition, and these contacts often contribute to the relative stabilization of the two states of the enzyme. Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (EC 2.1.3.2), which catalyzes the committed step of pyrimidine biosynthesis, the condensation of carbamoyl phosphate and l-aspartate to formN-carbamoyl-l-aspartate and inorganic phosphate (2Gerhart J.C. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 891-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has become a model system for the study of allosteric regulation. The enzyme shows homotropic cooperativity for the substratel-aspartate and is heterotropically regulated by ATP, CTP (2Gerhart J.C. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 891-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and UTP in the presence of CTP (3Wild J.R. Loughrey-Chen S.J. Corder T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The holoenzyme from E. coli is a dodecamer composed of six catalytic chains (C)1 ofM r 34,000 and six regulatory chains (R) ofM r 17,000. The catalytic chains are organized as two trimeric subunits, and the regulatory chains are organized as three dimeric subunits. The active sites are located at the interfaces between the catalytic chains, and the nucleotide effectors bind to the same site on each of the regulatory chains (4Gerhart J.C. Pardee A.B.

Two functionally and structurally different states of aspartate transcarbamoylase have been characterized (9Kantrowitz E.R. Lipscomb W.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 53-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The conversion from the T to R state occurs upon aspartate binding to the enzyme in the presence of carbamoyl phosphate. In addition to quaternary changes, several tertiary changes also occur in the T to R state transition; specifically the 80s and 240s loops of the catalytic chains reorganize. The distinct interchain contacts of side chains of the 240s loop in the T and R states have been identified as being major contributors to stabilization of the T and R states (10Ladjimi M.M. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For example, site-specific mutagenesis experiments have identified the interactions of Glu-239 as critical for the stabilization of the T and R states of the enzyme (10Ladjimi M.M. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1, Glu-239 of C1 2C followed by a number, e.g. C1 or C4, refers to a particular polypeptide chain in aspartate transcarbamoylase. forms interchain interactions with Lys-164 and Tyr-165 of C4 in the T state (11Krause K.L. Voltz K.W. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 527-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Conversion to the R state breaks these interactions and establishes new intrachain interactions between Glu-239 of C1 and Lys-164 and Tyr-165 of C1. Due to the symmetry of the enzyme, six of these interactions exist within the molecule. Site-specific mutagenesis of Glu-239 to Gln eliminates all six interactions, resulting in a mutant enzyme that functionally exhibits R state kinetics. In the presence of saturating concentrations of carbamoyl phosphate, the mutant enzyme exhibits no homotropic cooperativity and little if any heterotropic interactions. Based upon small-angle x-ray scattering, the mutant enzyme structurally exists in an altered conformation which is shifted significantly toward the R state (12Tauc P. Vachette P. Middleton S.A. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The loss of these interchain interactions also substantially reduces the stability of the T state as judged by the ability of saturating concentrations of carbamoyl phosphate, without aspartate, to induce the transition to the R state (10Ladjimi M.M. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Tauc P. Keiser R.T. Kantrowitz E.R. Vachette P. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1998-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In order to establish how much stabilization energy is necessary to maintain aspartate transcarbamoylase in the T state, a hybrid enzyme was studied in which one catalytic trimer had the native Glu at position 239 and the other catalytic trimer had Glu-239 replaced by Gln (14Sakash J.B. Chan R.S. Tsuruta H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 752-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This hybrid enzyme had only three of the six Glu-239 interactions that occur in the wild-type enzyme. The hybrid enzyme exhibited cooperativity and had an aspartate affinity and maximal velocity similar to both parent enzymes. Furthermore, the hybrid enzyme showed an approximately 50% response with the nucleotide effectors. On a functional level, these results suggest that three interactions are sufficient for stabilization of the T state of the enzyme. On a structural level, small-angle x-ray scattering studies showed that the hybrid enzyme is in an alternate conformation close to the T state of the wild-type enzyme. Although carbamoyl phosphate can initiate a slight conformational change toward the R state, the enzyme remains in a T-like state. In this study, we evaluate the contribution that each of the interchain interactions involving Glu-239 has on stabilizing the T and R states of the enzyme, and the contribution that each of these interchain interactions makes to the homotropic and heterotropic properties of the aspartate transcarbamoylase.

Equal amounts of native 239CEEE and native 239CQQQ were mixed and diluted to a final concentration of 7 mg/ml with 50 mmTris-Cl buffer, pH 8.3, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm EDTA, similar to the method previously described (21Lahue R.S. Schachman H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13906-13913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mixture was then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 8.3, 20 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm EDTA for 24 h. After equilibrating into 40 mm KH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.0, this mixture was examined by nondenaturing PAGE to confirm the formation of four catalytic subunit species, 239CEEE, 239CEEQ, 239CEQQ, and 239CQQQ. This mixture was fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography using a Bio-Rad Uno Q-1 column. The column was equilibrated with 40 mmKH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.0. After the sample was injected, the column was washed, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, for 4 min with 40 mm KH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.0, followed by 0–50% 40 mm KH2PO4buffer, pH 7.0, 1.0 m NaCl gradient over 20 min. Nondenaturing PAGE was used to identify the fractions containing 239CEEE, 239CEEQ, 239CEQQ, and 239CQQQ. The fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 40 mm KH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.0. Each species was rechromatographed a second time using identical conditions. Equal amounts of 239CEEQ and 239CEQQ were mixed with excess regulatory subunit and dialyzed overnight against 50 mmTris acetate buffer, pH 8.3, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm zinc acetate (22Sakash J.B.

The mixture was examined by nondenaturing PAGE to confirm the existence of the three holoenzyme species, (239CEEQ)2R3, (239CEEQ)(239CEQQ)R3, and (239CEQQ)2R3. Separation of the species was performed using the UNO Q-1 column as indicated previously. Equal amounts of 239CEQQ and 239CQQQ were mixed with excess regulatory subunit and dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3, 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm zinc acetate.

Separation of the species was performed using the UNO Q-1 column as indicated previously. The concentration of the wild-type holoenzyme, catalytic subunit, and regulatory subunit were determined from absorbance measurements at 280 nm using extinction coefficients of 0.59, 0.72, and 0.32 cm2mg−1, respectively (23Gerhart J.C. Holoubek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2886-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Dembowski N.J. Kantrowitz E.R. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the mutant enzymes were determined by the Bio-Rad version of the Bradford dye-binding assay (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The aspartate transcarbamoylase activity was measure at 25 °C by the colorimetric method (26Pastra-Landis S.C. Foote J. Kantrowitz E.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Saturation curves were performed in duplicate, and data points shown in the figures are the average values. Assays were performed in 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3. Data analysis of the steady state kinetics was carried out as described previously (27Silver R.S. Daigneault J.P. Teague P.D. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 729-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As has been previously shown (21Lahue R.S. Schachman H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13906-13913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), interchange of catalytic chains occurs when the catalytic subunit of aspartate transcarbamoylase is treated with sodium pyrophosphate. The intrachain catalytic subunit hybrids 239CEEQ and 239CEQQ were generated by mixing native 239CQQQwith native 239CEEE and then dialyzing the mixture against buffer containing 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate. The four species, 239CEEE, 239CEEQ, 239CEQQ, and 239CQQQ, were identified by nondenaturing PAGE and purified by anion-exchange chromatography (see Fig.2), The six aspartate residues attached to each catalytic chain containing Glu-239 give a sufficient difference in charge for the four catalytic subunit species to be eluted differentially by a salt gradient on the anion-exchange column (see Fig. 2). In previous work (14Sakash J.B. Chan R.S. Tsuruta H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 752-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the symmetric hybrid holoenzyme (239CEEE)(239CQQQ)R3, in which one catalytic trimer had the mutation at position 239, was investigated. This hybrid holoenzyme exhibited cooperativity and nucleotide effects that were not observed for the (239CEEE)2R3 holoenzyme. In this work the asymmetric (239CEEQ)(239CEQQ)R3holoenzyme was investigated. This enzyme has the same number of 239 interchain interactions as the symmetric hybrid (239CEEE)(239CQQQ)R3 but in a different geometric arrangement. The hybrid (239CEEQ)(239CEQQ)R3holoenzyme was generated by mixing 239CEEQ and 239CEQQ and regulatory subunit in excess. The species were identified by nondenaturing PAGE, and the (239CEEQ)(239CEQQ)R3 holoenzyme was purified by anion-exchange chromatography. Fig.3 shows the aspartate saturation curves produced by the reconstituted mutant enzymes, and the kinetic parameters calculated from these curves are given in TableI. The (239CEEQ)(239CEQQ)R3 holoenzyme exhibited a sigmoidal saturation curve with a Hill coefficient of 1.4 similar to the saturation curve of the symmetric (239CEEE)(239CQQQ)R3 holoenzyme previously characterized (14Sakash J.B.

The maximal velocity of the (239CEEQ)(239CEQQ)R3 holoenzyme was 16.0 mmol/h mg and the [Asp]0.5 was 6.6 mm, both of which are similar to the parameters of the symmetric (239CEEE)(239CQQQ)R3holoenzyme.Table IKinetic parameters of E239Q hybrid holoenzymes at pH 8.3EnzymeNo. of 239 interactionsMaximal velocity1-aMaximal velocity represents the maximal observed specific activity from the aspartate saturation curves.[Asp]0.5n Hmmol · mg −1 · h −1mm(239CEEE)2R3619.3 ± 1.81-bData from Sakash et al.(14).9.6 ± 0.82.6 ± 0.5(239CEEQ)2R3417.5 ± 1.21-cAverage deviation of three determinations.7.0 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.09(239CEEQ)(239CEQQ)R3316.0 ± 2.66.6 ± 0.71.4 ± 0.03(239CEEE)(239CQQQ)R3321.2 ± 1.81-bData from Sakash et al.(14).6.4 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.09EnzymeNo. of 239 interactionsMaximal velocityK mn Hmmol · mg −1 · h −1mm(239CEQQ)(239CEQQ)R3218.0 ± 0.85.4 ± 0.41(239CEQQ)(239CQQQ)R3116.2 ± 0.65.6 ± 0.091(239CQQQ)2R31-bData from Sakash et al.(14).020.0 ± 0.68.4 ± 0.21These data were determined from the aspartate saturation curves.

The influence of the allosteric effectors ATP and CTP on the asymmetric (239CEEQ)(239CEQQ)R3 holoenzyme was determined at one-half the [Asp]0.5 (see Fig.4). This concentration of aspartate was selected since the nucleotides exert a larger influence on the activity of the enzyme as the aspartate concentration is reduced (28Tauc P. Leconte C. Kerbiriou D.

Based upon these nucleotide saturation curves, the maximal extent of activation or inhibition at infinite nucleotide concentration was determined (Table II). As seen in Fig. 4, ATP activates the (239CEEQ)(239CEQQ)R3 holoenzyme 254% and CTP inhibits to a residual activity 34%, which are essentially the same as the values determined for the symmetric (239CEEE)(239CQQQ)R3 holoenzyme (14Sakash J.B.

Open table in a new tab These data were determined from ATP and CTP saturation curves (Fig. 4). Colorimetric assays were performed at 25 °C in 50 mmTris acetate buffer, pH 8.3. ATP and CTP saturation curves were determined at saturating levels of carbamoyl phosphate (4.8 mm) and aspartate concentrations at one-half the [Asp]0.5 of the respective holoenzyme at pH 8.3. The hybrid holoenzymes containing two out of six mutations at position 239, (239CEEQ)2R3, and four out of six mutations at position 239, (239QEQQ)2R3, were formed by mixing 239CEEQ, 239CEQQ, and regulatory subunit in excess. Three species were identified by nondenaturing PAGE and purified by anion-exchange chromatography. In a similar fashion, the hybrid holoenzyme containing one out of six mutations at position 239, (239CEQQ)(239CQQQ)R3, was formed by reconstitution of 239CEQQ and 239CQQQ with excess regulatory subunit followed by chromatography as indicated above. Fig. 3 shows the aspartate saturation curves produced by the reconstituted mutant enzymes, and the kinetic parameters calculated from these curves are shown in Table I. The (239CEEQ)2R3 holoenzyme exhibits a sigmoidal saturation curve with a Hill coefficient of 1.6. The maximal velocity of the (239CEEQ)2R3holoenzyme was 17.5 mmol/h mg, and the [Asp]0.5 was 7.0 mm (Table I). On the other hand, the (239CEQQ)2R3 and (239CEQQ)(239CQQQ)R3 holoenzymes exhibit hyperbolic saturation curves. The (239CEQQ)2R3 holoenzyme has an observed maximal specific activity of 18.0 mmol/mg h and aK m of 5.4 mm; the (239CEQQ)(239CQQQ)R3 holoenzyme has an observed maximal specific activity of 16.2 mmol/mg h and aK m of 5.6 mm. Nucleotide saturation curves with CTP and ATP were determined with the (239CEEQ)2R3, (239CEQQ)2R3, and (239CEQQ)(239CQQQ)R3 holoenzymes at one-half the [Asp]0.5 (Fig. 4). As seen in Fig. 4, ATP activates and CTP inhibits all three holoenzymes. The (239CEEQ)2R3 holoenzyme is activated by ATP 345% and inhibited by CTP to a residual activity of 29.3%; these parameters indicate a greater response than the (239CEEQ)(239CEQQ)R3 holoenzyme but a reduced response compared with the (239EEE)2R3 holoenzyme. The (239CEQQ)2R3 holoenzyme is activated by ATP 147%, and the (239CEQQ)(239CQQQ)R3 holoenzyme is activated 110%. These enzymes are inhibited by CTP to a residual activity of 46.5 and 67.4%, respectively. The bisubstrate analog PALA is able to activate wild-type aspartate transcarbamoylase holoenzyme at low concentrations of aspartate and saturating concentrations of carbamoyl phosphate. This activation is due to the ability of this compound to convert the enzyme from the low activity, low affinity T state to the high activity, high affinity R state. This activation can therefore be used to verify the ability of a mutant enzyme to undergo the allosteric transition. Therefore, the effect of PALA on the mutant intrasubunit hybrid enzymes was determined at 0.2× [Asp]0.5 (data not shown). PALA activated both (239CEEQ)2R3 and (239CEEQ)(239CEQQ)R3 holoenzymes; the (239CEEQ)2R3 holoenzyme was activated to a slightly greater extent than (239CEEQ)(239CEQQ)R3 holoenzyme. PALA inhibited both the (239CEQQ)2R3 and (239CEQQ)(239CQQQ)R3 holoenzymes, with no detectable initial activation. The ability of E. coli aspartate transcarbamoylase to regulate pyrimidine biosynthesis is due to its ability to alter its activity in both a homotropic and heterotropic fashion. A characteristic of allosteric enzymes is that they exist in two or more functional and structural states that differ in activity and affinity. For aspartate transcarbamoylase these two states (T and R) are structurally different, and each structure is stabilized by different interchain and interdomain interactions. Many of these stabilizing interactions have been characterized (9Kantrowitz E.R. Lipscomb W.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 53-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and one of the most important interactions for establishment of both the homotropic cooperativity and heterotropic interactions involves Glu-239 of the catalytic chain. Previous studies have shown that the replacement of Glu-239 with Gln in all six catalytic chains of aspartate transcarbamoylase results in a holoenzyme devoid of both homotropic and heterotropic interactions (10Ladjimi M.M. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, when only three of the six 239 positions are replaced by Gln both homotropic and heterotropic interactions are restored (14Sakash J.B. Chan R.S. Tsuruta H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 752-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1, Glu-239 is involved in intersubunit interactions in the T state and intrachain interactions in the R state. Small-angle x-ray scattering experiments have shown that when all six of the Glu-239 interactions are broken, the mutant enzyme exists in a new quaternary structure, different from either T or R, but shifted toward the R state of the wild-type enzyme (12Tauc P. Vachette P. Middleton S.A. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The fact that this scattering pattern is shifted completely to the R state in the presence of only carbamoyl phosphate explains the lack of both homotropic and heterotropic interactions in the mutant enzyme. However, when only three of the Glu-239 interactions are broken, small-angle x-ray scattering data suggest an enzyme that remains essentially in the T state. This explains the restoration of both homotropic and heterotropic interactions (14Sakash J.B. Chan R.S. Tsuruta H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 752-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the addition of six aspartic acid residues as a C-terminal extension of the catalytic chain of aspartate transcarbamoylase is an effective method for the preparation of hybrid versions of aspartate transcarbamoylase in which the two catalytic subunits are different (14Sakash J.B. Chan R.S. Tsuruta H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 752-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here we show that this same Asp tail extension is also effective for preparation of hybrid versions of the catalytic subunit, in which one or more of the chains are different. By using this methodology, we have been able to prepare catalytic subunits in which one or two chains have Glu-239 replaced by Gln. These intrachain hybrid catalytic subunits were then used to create hybrid holoenzymes that have a varying number of Glu-239 stabilizing interactions. With the holoenzymes containing one or two Glu-239 interactions per molecule, we were able to evaluate the minimal number of interactions necessary to stabilize the T state of aspartate transcarbamoylase and therefore allow the enzyme to exhibit an allosteric transition. Other hybrids have allowed us to determine if the interactions between the upper and lower catalytic trimers of aspartate transcarbamoylase must be in a particular geometric arrangement for function. Both the previously investigated symmetric hybrid holoenzyme, (239CEEE)(239CQQQ)R3 (14Sakash J.B. Chan R.S. Tsuruta H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 752-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the asymmetric hybrid holoenzyme, (239CEEQ)(239CEQQ)R3, reported here, have three of the six possible Glu-239 interchain-stabilizing interactions. However, in the asymmetric hybrid holoenzyme two interactions originate from one catalytic trimer and one interaction originates from the other catalytic trimer. The asymmetric hybrid holoenzyme exhibits both homotropic and heterotropic properties that are very similar to the symmetric hybrid holoenzyme (Table I and TableII). Thus, the arrangement of the three stabilizing interactions (i.e. symmetric versus asymmetric) does not influence the homotropic and heterotropic properties of the enzyme. These data suggest that the number of stabilizing interactions and not the geometric arrangement of the interactions affects the global stabilization of the enzyme and is the critical requirement for the manifestation of homotropic and heterotropic interactions in aspartate transcarbamoylase. The cooperativity of aspartate transcarbamoylase is related to the number of Glu-239 stabilizing interactions. As seen in Fig.5, the hybrids that have less than three Glu-239 stabilizing interactions do not exhibit homotropic cooperativity. These results suggest that less than three interactions across the trimer interface do not provide sufficient stabilization to maintain the enzyme in the T state, and therefore homotropic cooperativity is lost. However, all the hybrid enzymes that have three or more of the Glu-239 stabilizing interactions exhibit cooperativity. Furthermore, the extent of cooperativity observed with these hybrid enzymes is enhanced as the number of the Glu-239 stabilizing interactions increases (see Fig. 5 and Table I). These functional data together with structural data from small-angle x-ray scattering (14Sakash J.B. Chan R.S. Tsuruta H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 752-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) indicate that three Glu-239 stabilizing interactions are sufficient to stabilize the enzyme in the T state allowing both a functional and structural transition to the R state. When one additional Glu-239 stabilizing interaction is eliminated cooperativity is destroyed. Thus, the difference in free energy between an enzyme with and without homotropic cooperativity is essentially one salt link. Each of the Glu-239 interactions adds to the global stabilization of the T state of the enzyme. As links are lost, the T state is progressively destabilized until the fourth is eliminated. With only two Glu-239 stabilizing interactions, the T state quaternary structure is no longer stable, and the enzyme shifts toward an R-like conformation. The addition of carbamoyl phosphate may convert the enzyme to a state nearly identical to the R state of the wild-type enzyme as was observed for the (239CEEE)2R3 holoenzyme (12Tauc P. Vachette P. Middleton S.A. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Contrary to the results describing homotropic cooperativity, the heterotropic interactions, such as the extent of ATP activation and CTP inhibition, are related to the number of Glu-239 stabilizing interactions (see Fig. 5). Furthermore, the extent of the response to both ATP and CTP is related to whether or not the enzyme exhibits homotropic cooperativity. As seen in Fig. 5, CTP has a strong inhibitory effect on the hybrid enzymes that have only one or two Glu-239 stabilizing interactions. With only one or two Glu-239 stabilizing interactions, the enzyme exists in an R-like state in which CTP can function both to shift the allosteric equilibrium back to the T state and to have a direct inhibitory influence on catalysis. However, wild-type like CTP inhibition is not observed for these hybrids suggesting that the Glu-239 interactions must be necessary to fully stabilize the enzyme in the T state. The ability of the nucleotides to function by both a primary and secondary mode has been previously proposed (28Tauc P. Leconte C. Kerbiriou D. Thiry L. Hervé G. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 155: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the absence of cooperativity, ATP is only able to activate these hybrids slightly, suggesting that ATP is unable to shift the enzyme toward the R state, since the quaternary structure of the holoenzyme is essentially R. The hybrid enzymes that demonstrate cooperativity, with three or more Glu-239 stabilizing interactions, have a dramatically different response toward the nucleotides. As the number of Glu-239 stabilizing interactions increases, the additional inhibition by CTP decreases, and the additional activation by ATP increases (see Fig. 5). In the case of ATP, the establishment of cooperativity in the hybrids with three or more Glu-239 stabilizing interactions makes the R state more accessible, and ATP shows significantly enhanced stimulation. All six Glu-239 interactions are necessary for a fully T state holoenzyme. Even the presence of CTP does not add sufficient stabilization for the holoenzyme to attain the T state if one Glu-239 interaction is broken. The binding energy of CTP can not compensate for the energy lost by the removal of one Glu-239 salt link. The effect of missing Glu-239 salt links is globally distributed throughout the holoenzyme based upon the kinetic and nucleotide studies on this series of holoenzymes. Each salt link may act as a clamp, holding the holoenzyme in the T conformation. When the first and second salt links are “systematically” removed, it is as if the clamps have been removed and the enzyme flips toward the R state as indicated by the sharp initial decrease in the ATP effect on the one and two mutant hybrid enzymes. CTP may be able to shift the holoenzyme back toward the T state; however, without the salt links, the enzyme cannot be clamped down in the T state. From this and previous studies (10Ladjimi M.M. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Tauc P. Vachette P. Middleton S.A. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 14Sakash J.B. Chan R.S. Tsuruta H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 752-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), it is clear that the 239 stabilizing interactions play a critical role in the manifestation of homotropic cooperativity in aspartate transcarbamoylase. The interchain interactions involving Glu-239 are critically important for stabilization of the T state. However, the binding of aspartate, after the ordered binding of carbamoyl phosphate, to one or so of the active sites initiates the global conformational change to the R state. The energy associated with aspartate binding induces the closure of the aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate domains of the particular catalytic chain to which the aspartate bound. This domain closure induces alterations in the 80s loop of an adjacent catalytic chain necessary to complete the formation of the active site as well as a repositioning of the 240s loop that allows a set of intradomain bridging interactions involving Arg-229, Arg-233, and Glu-50 to stabilize the domain-closed high activity, high affinity active site. The closure of these domains and the movement of the 240s loop influence the Glu-239 interchain-stabilizing interactions in two ways. First, as a 240s loop repositions, the corresponding Glu-239 interchain link becomes destabilized and is broken. Second, this 240s loop cannot adapt its R state conformation without the quaternary conformational change of the molecule to relieve the steric clash of this 240s loop with a nearby 240s loop moving in the opposite direction (10Ladjimi M.M. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As substrate-binding energy is utilized, more and more of the T state stabilizing interactions are relaxed and finally the enzyme flips to the R state. In the case of the Glu-239 stabilizing interactions, more than three of these interactions must be broken before the enzymes shifts to the R state. It has recently been suggested (29Endrizzi J.A. Beernink P.T. Alber T. Schachman H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5077-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that the similar structure between the isolated catalytic subunit in the unligated and PALA-ligated states compared with the catalytic subunit of the unligated and PALA-ligated states of the holoenzyme indicates that the conformational differences observed between the unligated and ligated states of the catalytic subunit are not responsible for homotropic cooperativity. However, when the catalytic and regulatory subunits combine to form the holoenzyme, additional intersubunit interactions are established. This exquisite set of intersubunit interactions between the catalytic and regulatory chains and between the two catalytic trimers, such as the Glu-239 stabilizing interactions, provides a global set of interlocking interactions for the holoenzyme. These interactions work in a concerted fashion with the substrate-induced local conformational changes, as observed in the structure of the isolated catalytic subunit, to drive the quaternary T to R transition of aspartate transcarbamoylase and functionally induced homotropic cooperativity. We thank Robin S. Chan and Tatyana Vorobyova for help in purifying the large quantities of the catalytic and regulatory subunits necessary for these experiments."

Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy microeinstein membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin lactose permease In secondary active transport, proteins employ a transmembrane electrochemical potential to translocate solutes across the membrane. This process plays a central metabolic role in all living cells. The molecular mechanism by which a transporter transduces a protonmotive force into a solute gradient is the focus of our study. The lactose permease is a transmembrane protein that is responsible for the uptake of lactose into the bacterial cytoplasm (1West I.C. Mitchell P. Biochem. J. 1973; 132: 587-592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The permease is a member of the major facilitator superfamily; members of the major facilitator superfamily catalyze uniport, symport, or antiport (reviewed in Ref.2Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lactose permease is a symporter that can harness the free energy stored in a proton electrochemical gradient to drive the accumulation of lactose against a concentration gradient (1West I.C. Mitchell P. Biochem. J. 1973; 132: 587-592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The permease transports protons and lactose with a one-to-one stoichiometry. A number of mutagenesis studies have led to models suggesting that a few ionizable residues along transmembrane segments play key roles in the mechanism of H+/lactose symport (3Kaback H.R. Wu J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1999; 32: 805-813Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar,4Johnson J.L. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4074-4081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence regarding the mechanism of chemiosmotic coupling in the lactose permease and related transporters has not been available.The goal of this study was to obtain dynamic information about structural changes in the permease associated with the imposition of an electrochemical gradient. To carry out this experiment, we have employed co-reconstitution (5Racker E. Stoeckenuis W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 662-663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Perozo E. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10471-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 7Santacruz-Toloza L. Perozo E. Papazian D.M.

Rothschild K.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 541-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Reaction-induced FT-IR spectroscopy requires that a single sample be modulated between two structural states of interest. Co-reconstituted samples provide such a light-activatable and reversible experimental system. When a laser flash is given, bacteriorhodopsin pumps protons across the membrane and creates a H+ electrochemical gradient (9Henderson R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioenerg. 1977; 6: 87-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In this initial study, we focus on structural changes in the absence of galactoside. In the absence of lactose, the protein cannot cycle through the multiple conformational states required for the transport of a H+ with lactose (10Winkler H.H. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2200-2211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the electrochemical gradient is expected to cause structural changes in the permease; these structural changes have been shown previously to decrease the K m value for lactose by 2 orders of magnitude (11Kaczorowski G.J. Robertson D.E. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3697-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This structural perturbation may consist of a number of possible events, including changes in protonation, hydrogen bonding, and pK a values of amino acid side chains, secondary and tertiary structural changes, and helix rearrangements. Vibrational spectroscopy can monitor and identify all of these changes in protein structure. Here, we report a study that is the first step in elucidating the mechanism by which a symporter responds to the imposition of an electrochemical gradient.RESULTSCo-reconstitution of bacteriorhodopsin and lactose permease was accomplished with a freeze-thaw method. Functional co-reconstitution was verified using a counterflow assay at pH 6.0 and pH 7.4 (Fig.1). In this assay, proteoliposomes were pre-loaded with a high concentration of nonlabeled lactose and then were diluted into a solution containing radiolabeled lactose. The data obtained after dilution typically yield a biphasic curve (12Patzlaff J.S. Moeller J.A. Barry B.A. Brooker R.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15363-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The initial rapid phase of radiolabeled lactose uptake is due to an electroneutral lactose exchange reaction, which is insensitive to changes in the electrochemical gradient (10Winkler H.H. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2200-2211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A slow phase of H+/lactose efflux is also seen, and this phase is affected by the H+ electrochemical gradient (11Kaczorowski G.J. Robertson D.E. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3697-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that proteoliposomes containing the purified permease have low passive permeability to protons and a slow efflux reaction (12Patzlaff J.S. Moeller J.A. Barry B.A. Brooker R.J.

However, upon illumination of the co-reconstituted sample, the efflux phase of the assay was accelerated (Fig. 1). The stimulation was observed at both pH 6.0 and 7.4 and was similar at the two pH values, given the error bars (Fig. 1, A andB). These data indicate that bacteriorhodopsin pumps H+ into the vesicles and promotes H+/lactose efflux. This inside-out orientation for bacteriorhodopsin has been observed in other reconstitution studies (5Racker E. Stoeckenuis W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 662-663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lozier R.H. Niederberger W. Bogomolni R.A. Hwang S.-B. Stoeckenius W. Biochim. Biophys.

A. 1977; 74: 5426-5430Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because illumination resulted in the efflux of lactose to background levels (Fig. 1, A and B), the results indicate that nearly all permease molecules were reconstituted into vesicles containing bacteriorhodopsin.The rate of efflux was calculated from the data presented in Fig. 1. The values were in the range from 0.01 to 0.02 lactose (min·permease)−1 and are in reasonable agreement with the rate of efflux previously observed at pH 6.0 in the presence of uncoupler (0.02 lactose (min·permease)−1) (12Patzlaff J.S. Moeller J.A. Barry B.A. Brooker R.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15363-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and observed with a different permease preparation at pH 7.5 (22Le Coutre J.

These values are much slower than reported rates of proton pumping by bacteriorhodopsin (for example see Ref. 23Oesterhelt D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 88: 10-17Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggesting that the permease reactions are rate-limiting.Fig. 2 presents the results obtained from reaction-induced FT-IR spectroscopy. The light-minus-dark spectra were generated by manipulation of data obtained 1 min following (positive) and 5 min following (negative) laser excitation. As expected, proteoliposomes containing lactose permease alone (LP) gave rise to no defined spectral features (Fig. 2 A). Proteoliposomes containing bacteriorhodopsin alone (bR) gave rise to a light-minus-dark difference FT-IR spectrum similar to spectra previously obtained (for example see Refs. 24Braiman M.S. Mogi T.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). This spectrum is associated with the isomerization of the retinal chromophore and the deprotonation of bacteriorhodopsin's retinal Schiff base chromophore (reviewed in Ref. 27Rothschild K.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 147-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). A positive band at approximately 1762 cm−1 is attributable to the protonation of Asp-85 in the M intermediate, whereas a negative band at approximately 1746 cm−1 is attributable to the deprotonation of Asp-96, which occurs in the N intermediate (see Ref. 27Rothschild K.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 147-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar and references therein). Note that bR spectral changes occurring after the 1st min of data acquisition include a shift from 1762 (positive) to 1752 (positive) cm−1 (data not shown). Such spectral evolution has previously been attributed to the N→O transitions of the proton pumping cycle (27Rothschild K.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 147-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar).Figure 2Reaction induced FT-IR spectra obtained from lactose permease (A), bacteriorhodopsin (B), bacteriorhodopsin and 0.5 mm lactose (C), bacteriorhodopsin and non-permease-containing membrane fractions from E. coli (D), bacteriorhodopsin and lactose permease (E), and bacteriorhodopsin, lactose permease, and 0.5 mm lactose (F). Data represent the average of 60 (A–D) or 240 (E and F) difference spectra obtained on 2 (A–D) or 8 (E andF) different days of data acquisition. The tick marks on the y axis are 0.002 absorbance units. Spectra in B–F were corrected for protein and bacteriorhodopsin content as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The spectrum obtained from proteoliposomes containing bacteriorhodopsin and 0.5 mm lactose (Fig. 2 C) resembles data obtained in the absence of lactose (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, when bacteriorhodopsin was co-reconstituted with non-permease containing protein fractions (MP) isolated from the E. colimembrane, no significant spectral perturbations were observed (Fig.2 D).Spectra obtained from lactose permease-bacteriorhodopsin co-reconstituted samples (bR + LP) are presented in Fig. 2 E. Spectral differences are evident when B and E of Fig. 2 are compared. Changes in intensity and frequency are observed in the 1770–1720, 1660–1600, and 1560–1510 cm−1 spectral regions. The lactose permease-bacteriorhodopsin spectrum (Fig.2 E) was altered by the addition of 0.5 mmlactose to the sample (Fig. 2 F).The spectral contributions from bacteriorhodopsin can be subtracted from these data, generating a double difference spectrum. Fig.3 A presents a double difference spectrum that identifies spectral features arising from the lactose permease, when the co-reconstituted sample was exposed to light in the absence of lactose. Generation of this double difference spectrum (Fig. 2 E minus Fig. 2 B) was based on optical measurement of the amount of bacteriorhodopsin and total protein in the sample, because the spectra shown in Fig. 2 were scaled by the absorbance at 280 and 565 nm. Notable spectral features are evident in the 1765–1720, 1700–1660, 1640–1590, and 1560–1525 cm−1 regions of these data (Fig.3 A). In Fig. 3 B, we present a double difference spectrum (Fig. 2 F minus Fig. 2 B) that demonstrates the effect of 0.5 mm lactose on these data. The presence of lactose reduced spectral amplitude; however, positive bands at 1636 and 1527 cm−1 were still observed (Fig. 3 B). Overall, the addition of lactose had a dramatic effect on the spectrum (compare Fig. 3, A andB). As a control, a double difference spectrum (Fig.3 C) was constructed from data obtained from bacteriorhodopsin-containing proteoliposomes in the absence (Fig.2 B) and the presence (Fig. 2 C) of 0.5 mm lactose. No defined spectral features were observed (Fig. 3 C), supporting the conclusion that lactose has no direct effects on the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle.Figure 3Reaction-induced FT-IR spectra associated with the effects of the electrochemical potential. Data reflect structural changes in the lactose permease in the absence (A) and in the presence (B) of 0.5 mmlactose. Data in A were derived by a one-to-one subtraction of Fig. 2 B (bR) from Fig. 2 E (bR + LP); data inB were derived by a one-to-one subtraction of Fig.2 B (bR) from Fig. 2 F (bR + LP + lactose). Negative controls in C and D were derived by a one-to-one subtraction of Fig. 2 B (bR) from Fig.2 C (bR + lactose) and by a one-to-one subtraction of Fig.2 B (bR) from Fig. 2 D (bR + MP). Shadedspectral features in A are discussed in the text. Positive features result from the imposition of the electrochemical potential (ΔμH+ ON). The tick marks on the y axis represent 0.001 absorbance units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Taken together, these experiments suggest that spectral features in Fig. 3 A arise from the permease and do not arise from indirect effects of co-reconstitution on bacteriorhodopsin. As an additional control, a double difference spectrum (Fig. 3 D) was constructed from data obtained on proteoliposomes in which bacteriorhodopsin was present alone (Fig. 2 B) or reconstituted with non-permease containing MP fractions (Fig.2 D). No defined spectral features were observed (Fig.3 D), supporting the conclusion that the subtraction and normalization procedures are effective and that the permease alone contributes to Fig. 3 A.The subtraction method employed to generate Fig. 3 has the advantage that no assumptions are made concerning potential permease contributions to the spectrum. However, more subjective methods can also be applied. In Fig. 4 B, the double difference spectrum obtained by a one-to-one subtraction of UV-visible corrected data is repeated from Fig. 3 A. In Fig.4 A, bacteriorhodopsin contributions have been over-subtracted in order to minimize spectral contributions at 1527 cm−1. In Fig. 4 C, bacteriorhodopsin contributions have been under-subtracted by the same factor. Comparison of Fig. 4, A–C, shows that the spectral region between 1760 and 1670 cm−1 is relatively insensitive to differences in the bacteriorhodopsin subtraction parameter. The positive band at 1734 cm−1 was observed to be nearly invariant in amplitude and frequency (Fig. 4, A–C). The band at 1761 cm−1 was observed at each value of the subtraction parameter but exhibited amplitude variation (Fig. 4, A–C). However, observed spectral differences are on the same order of magnitude as the spectral variation observed over different days of data acquisition and with different co-reconstituted samples (Fig. 4, insets I and II). Therefore, we attribute a positive spectral feature at 1734 cm−1, and possibly 1761 cm−1, to the permease. These conclusions will be tested with isotopic labeling.Figure 4Double difference spectra generated using different subtraction parameters. Data were derived by subtraction of Fig. 2 B (bR) from Fig. 2 E (bR + LP).B, the bR subtraction parameter was 1.0; this spectrum is repeated from Fig. 3 A to facilitate comparison.A, bR was over-subtracted with a subtraction parameter of 1.15. C, bR was under-subtracted with a subtraction parameter of 0.85. Shaded spectral regions are attributed to the lactose permease and are relatively insensitive to the choice of bR subtraction parameter. Insets I and II show the reproducibility of double difference spectra averaged over different days of data acquisition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Note that although the spectral regions between 2000 and 1660 cm−1 (Fig. 4, inset I) and between 1640 and 1250 cm−1 (Fig. 4, inset II) were similar on different days of data acquisition and with different co-reconstituted samples, the amide I region (1650 cm−1) did not give sufficiently reproducible results to enable an interpretation of this region of the spectrum. The origin of this spectral variation in the amide I region is under investigation but may be due to variation in protein content and interaction in individual proteoliposomes.The variation in water content has the potential to affect the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle (for examples see Refs. 26Sasaki J. Lanyi J.K. Needleman R. Yoshizawa T. Maeda A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28Korenstein R. Hess B.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12282-12287Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and therefore to compromise the accurate generation of double difference spectra using our methods. To address this point, we present the data in Fig. 5. The FT-IR spectrum of liquid water (Fig. 5 A) showed that an intense OH stretching band was observed at 3290 cm−1, whereas, as expected, there was little significant contribution from water at 1545 cm−1. The FT-IR spectra in Fig. 5,B and C, were generated by ratioing data to the same background and by averaging over each bR and bacteriorhodopsin permease co-reconstituted sample (bR + LP) employed for reaction-induced FT-IR data acquisition. By using the infrared molar absorptivities for water (3500 cm−1) and bacteriorhodopsin (1545 cm−1) previously reported (30Braiman M.S. Ahl P.L. Rothschild K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5221-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the hydration state of the bR sample (Fig.5 A) was estimated as approximately 30% (w/w).Figure 5FT-IR absorption spectra of water (A), bacteriorhodopsin samples employed for reaction-induced measurements (B), and co-reconstituted bacteriorhodopsin and lactose permease samples employed for reaction-induced measurements (C).The spectrum in A was collected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Spectra in B and Cwere constructed by ratioing data to the same background; data were averaged over all samples used to generate Fig. 2. Absorption spectra were amide II corrected before averaging. Dashed lines at 3290 and 1545 cm−1 show the frequencies used to evaluate the water/protein ratio. B, the concentration of bacteriorhodopsin was 34.6 μm, and the concentration of lipid was 11 μm. C, the concentration of bacteriorhodopsin was 34.6 μm; the concentration of lactose permease was 21.5 μm, and the concentration of lipid was 11 μm. The molecular masses employed were as follows: bacteriorhodopsin, 26,000 (13Stoeckenius W. Bogomolni R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 52: 587-616Crossref Scopus (566) Google Scholar); E. coli lipids, 800; lactose permease, 46,500 (38Kaback H.R. Wu J. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1997; 30: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The ratio of amplitudes at 3290 and 1545 cm−1(Fig. 5, dotted lines) can give a precise estimate of changing water content in these samples, because protein is expected to contribute at both frequencies (31Krimm S. Bandekar J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 33: 181-364Crossref Scopus (2658) Google Scholar, 32Bellamy, L. J. (1980) The Infrared Spectra of Complex Molecules, Vol. 1, pp. 183–202, 231–262, Chapman and Hall Ltd., LondonGoogle Scholar), whereas water contributes significantly only at 3290 cm−1 (Fig.5 A). The average ratio obtained (3290/1545 cm−1) was 1.3 ± 0.5 for the bR samples (Fig. 5 B), 1.1 ± 0.2 for the bR + LP samples (Fig.5 C), and 1.1 ± 0.1 for the bR + MP samples (data not shown). This analysis was consistent with no significant variation in water content when bR, bR + LP, and bR + MP samples were compared. In particular, there was no observed correlation between the 3290/1545 cm−1 ratio and the appearance of spectral features in the double difference spectrum (Fig. 3).DISCUSSIONIn order to obtain novel molecular information about transport mechanism, we have employed a new spectroscopic method, reaction-induced FT-IR spectroscopy, to study the lactose permease. Vibrational spectroscopy can yield dynamic information about structural changes occurring in membrane proteins. In our method, lactose permease and bacteriorhodopsin are co-reconstituted, and bacteriorhodopsin is then used as a light-activatable source of a proton electrochemical gradient. Subtraction of bacteriorhodopsin contributions gives a spectrum corresponding to the permease alone. In the resulting double difference spectrum, the region from 1760 to 1660 cm−1 was found to be relatively insensitive to the bacteriorhodopsin subtraction parameter employed. Accordingly, in this report, we focus on a preliminary interpretation of this spectral region.Positive vibrational lines in Fig. 3 A with frequencies between 1765 and 1720 cm−1 are assigned to carbonyl stretching bands of glutamic and aspartic acid residues. Aspartic and glutamic acid are the only functional groups in proteins expected to have absorption in this region of the spectrum (33Flett M.S.C. Spectrochim. Acta. 1962; 18: 1537-1556Crossref Google Scholar, 34Ramirez F.J. Navarrete J.T.L. Spectrochim. Acta Part A Mol. Spectrosc. 1995; 51: 293-302Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because two spectral frequencies may be observed (1761 and 1734 cm−1), it is likely that more than one glutamic/aspartic acid residue contributes to the spectrum. An inverse linear correlation of pK a values and frequency has been observed for certain classes of carboxylic acids (32Bellamy, L. J. (1980) The Infrared Spectra of Complex Molecules, Vol. 1, pp. 183–202, 231–262, Chapman and Hall Ltd., LondonGoogle Scholar). Changes in dielectric constant and hydrogen bonding also influence frequency (32Bellamy, L. J. (1980) The Infrared Spectra of Complex Molecules, Vol. 1, pp. 183–202, 231–262, Chapman and Hall Ltd., LondonGoogle Scholar, 35Dioumaev A.K. Braiman M.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 10572-10574Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar).There are two mechanisms by which carboxylic acids can contribute positive lines to Fig. 3 A. The first is that the imposition of the electrochemical gradient causes protonation of one or more carboxylates, and the second is that the electrochemical gradient causes a change in pK a, hydrogen bonding, and/or dielectric constant (32Bellamy, L. J. (1980) The Infrared Spectra of Complex Molecules, Vol. 1, pp. 183–202, 231–262, Chapman and Hall Ltd., LondonGoogle Scholar). These two processes have different vibrational signatures. For example, upon protonation of aspartatein vitro, the 1721 cm−1 C=O and 1211 cm−1 C–O vibrations of the acid replace the 1574 cm−1 asymmetric and 1391 cm−1 symmetric CO stretching vibrations of the aspartate anion (18Hutchison R.S. Steenhuis J.J. Yocum C.F. Razeghifard R.M. Barry B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31987-31995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For environmental perturbations or pK a shifts, a derivative-shaped spectral feature is expected, corresponding to a smaller frequency shift caused by a change in the basicity or double bond character of the C=O bond (32Bellamy, L. J. (1980) The Infrared Spectra of Complex Molecules, Vol. 1, pp. 183–202, 231–262, Chapman and Hall Ltd., LondonGoogle Scholar, 35Dioumaev A.K. Braiman M.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 10572-10574Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar,36Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11927-11932Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar).One interpretation of Fig. 3 A is that negative spectral features at 1692 and, possibly, 1668 cm−1 are associated with the positive 1734 cm−1 line. This interpretation is consistent with a dramatic change in pK a or environment, when the electrochemical gradient is applied. Alternatively, the 1668 cm−1 and, possibly, the 1692 cm−1 line could arise from amide I bands (31Krimm S. Bandekar J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 33: 181-364Crossref Scopus (2658) Google Scholar). Another possible interpretation of the spectrum is a protonation reaction. Although this interpretation cannot be completely excluded at this time, we do not favor it because the spectrum lacks defined features in the 1400 cm−1 region. A definitive assignment of the 1761, 1734, 1692, and 1668 cm−1 lines will be performed through the use of isotopic labeling.In the presence of lactose, the spectrum associated with the imposition of the electrochemical gradient is altered dramatically (Fig.3 B). Given our current signal-to-noise, only two significant spectral features are observed with frequencies at 1636 and 1527 cm−1. In the presence of lactose, the overall observation is a decrease in amplitude throughout most of the 2000–1250 cm−1 region. This generalized decrease in intensity may be due to the time scale of our measurements. In the absence of lactose, the permease cannot convert between inwardly accessible and outwardly accessible conformations (10Winkler H.H. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2200-2211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, when both substrates are available, the permease can cycle through the complete transport process. The turnover number for uphill lactose symport has been reported to be 16–18 s−1 in proteoliposomes (37Kaback H.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 279-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This turnover rate may preclude the accumulation of reaction intermediates on the time scale employed here. This possibility will be explored in the future through the use of step-scan and rapid-scan FT-IR techniques. A detailed interpretation of Fig.3 B awaits these future studies.The results of our spectroscopic study indicate that the electrochemical gradient perturbs aspartic and glutamic acid residues in the permease. This perturbation may correspond to an alteration in hydrogen bonding, dielectric constant, pK a, or protonation state. The observation that the electrochemical gradient perturbs carboxylic acid residues is consistent with previous work showing that mutations of carboxylates at positions 126, 240, 269, and 325 block the active accumulation of lactose (see Refs. 3Kaback H.R. Wu J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1999; 32: 805-813Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 4Johnson J.L. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4074-4081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar and references therein). A change in pK a or net protonation reaction could be involved in the storage of free energy derived from the electrochemical gradient. This change in pK a and/or protonation could be a direct result of the proton gradient or could be an indirect effect caused by the generation of positive charge or by helix dipole rearrangements. In secondary active transport, proteins employ a transmembr"
