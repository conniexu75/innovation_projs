https://openalex.org/W1553328291,"At pH 7.0, in air, 20% of the total electron flux through xanthine oxidase can be accounted for in terms of the univalent reduction of oxygen. The fraction of the total flux of electrons which traversed the univalent pathway to oxygen was increased by raising the pH and by raising the oxygen tension. It was further shown that at any given pH and oxygen tension, the amount of univalently reduced oxygen, which was detectable in terms of the reduction of cytochrome c, rose as the turnover rate of the enzyme was decreased by decreasing the concentration of xanthine. This effect of xanthine was more pronounced at pH 7.0 than at pH 10.0. Another reflection of this same phenomenon was a difference in Km for xanthine measured in terms of urate production as compared to Km for xanthine measured in terms of cytochrome c reduction. Here too the differences were diminished as the pH and the oxygen tension were raised. The quantitative aspects of these phenomena are presented as well as an explanation which is consistent with all of the observations and which was, in fact, predictive of several of them."
https://openalex.org/W1494066298,"Abstract Disulfide bonds in proteins and in seed meals were reduced with β-mercaptoethanol to sulfhydryl groups. The generated sulfhydryl groups were then alkylated by treatment with 4-vinylpyridine. The cysteine residues were thus derivatized to S-(4-pyridylethyl)-l-cysteine residues. The cysteine derivative is stable to acid hydrolysis and on amino acid analysis by ion exchange elutes just before arginine. Complete modification of sulfhydryl groups permits quantitative determination of cysteine and cystine content (half-cystine residues) of proteins and of seed meals. The sulfhydryl groups of cysteine are the only groups modified when the alkylation is performed on solutions of reduced proteins at pH 7.5 for 90 to 120 min with an amount of 4-vinylpyridine equivalent to the mercaptoethanol used for reduction. In order to obtain complete modification of the sulfhydryl groups in seed meals, a longer reaction time, 4.5 hours, and a concentration of 4-vinylpyridine equivalent to 3 times the mercaptoethanol concentration were required."
https://openalex.org/W1535941896,"Abstract The endogenous proteolytic degradation of the histones of calf thymus nucleohistone has been followed with polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis and dansylation of amino-terminal amino acids. The proteolytic enzyme is tightly associated with nucleohistone, is essentially inactive below pH 7.0, is decreased in activity at lower ionic strengths, shows a rather specific bond cleavage for those histone fractions which are susceptible to its attack, and is inactivated by brief heat treatment (2 min at 90°). The susceptibility of the five histone fractions to proteolysis is critically dependent upon whether the histones form a complex or not with DNA. In the intact nucleohistone three groups of histone are almost or totally resistant to proteolytic attack while the lysine-rich histone and the sulfhydryl-containing histone fractions are rapidly attacked. If histones are freed from DNA, only the lysine-rich fraction is resistant to the protease; all other fractions are rapidly degraded. In general those tissues having a high cell turnover, e.g. thymus and intestinal mucosa, exhibit a greater rate of proteolysis of nucleohistone than is observed for other tissue. The proteolytic activity is reversibly inhibited by either the presence of sodium bisulfite or by storing the nucleohistone at low ionic strength (∼5 x 10-4)."
https://openalex.org/W2122695744,"Abstract Human hemoglobin has been studied in parallel experiments on structure and function. Structure has been examined in terms of the extent of dissociation into subunits in very dilute solutions by sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments with a scanning ultracentrifuge. Functional properties of the hemoglobin solutions have been evaluated by two rapid kinetic approaches, stopped flow mixing experiments with deoxyhemoglobin and carbon monoxide and flash photolysis experiments with CO-hemoglobin. The experiments indicate that the dissociation of tetrameric CO-hemoglobin into dimers is accompanied by a transition in kinetic properties from a slow rate of recombination with CO following a flash (k ∼ 1.5 x 105 m-1 sec-1) to a rapid rate of recombination (k ∼ 6 x 106 m-1 sec-1). The correlation of dissociation into dimeric units with enhancement in CO recombination rate is maintained under several conditions for which the tetramer-dimer equilibrium is considerably altered by the addition of salts, such as NaCl and triethylamine-HCl. In the standard buffer, 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.0, the tetramer-dimer equilibrium is described by a dissociation constant of about 2 x 10-6 m (in heme). The dissociation of deoxyhemoglobin into subunits has also been studied by ultracentrifugation of dilute solutions under anaerobic conditions in the presence of dithionite. Compared to liganded hemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin has a much lower tendency to dissociate, and the dissociation is much less sensitive to the addition of salts. In phosphate buffer alone, a dissociation constant of K4,2 ∼ 10-7 m is found. Values for the dissociation constant of about 5 x 10-7 m are obtained under conditions which facilitate dissociation (2 m triethylamine-HCl). Companion studies, on the functional properties of these solutions by stopped flow kinetic analysis, show no transition in kinetic properties in the range of protein concentration where dissociation to dimers occurs. The slowly reacting behavior typical of strong solutions of tetrameric hemoglobin (k ∼ 1.5 x 105 m-1 sec-1) is retained even at concentrations as low as 5 x 10-8 m where dissociation to dimers is extensive. The observation that the dissociation of liganded and unliganded tetrameric hemoglobin gives rise to dimers with different functional properties may indicate the formation of different dimers, i.e. dissociation at different planes in the parent tetrameric molecules. The markedly lower sensitivity of the dissociation of unliganded hemoglobin to salts compared to liganded hemoglobin is consistent with this possibility. Further evidence is obtained by dissociation experiments on hemoglobin reacted partially or fully with p-mercuribenzoate. The results of these experiments, evaluated in terms of Perutz's atomic models of hemoglobin obtained by x-ray crystallography, suggest that liganded hemoglobin dissociates into dimers of the α1β1 type, whereas deoxyhemoglobin dissociates into dimers of the α1β2 type."
https://openalex.org/W1543862651,"Concentrations of acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate and their specific radioactivities were shown to be assayable directly in plasma of the rat without the need for prior deproteinization. By utilizing this technique ketone body turnover was estimated in the isotopic steady state and after the single injection of radioactive acetoacetate or β-hydroxybutyrate. While difficulties exist in both types of experiments, the turnover rate of total ketones in the rat was shown to be in the range of 8.1 to 13.2 µmoles per min per 100 g of body weight during starvation ketosis with the true rate probably being closer to the lower figure. The turnover rate in acute diabetic ketosis approximated 15 µmoles per min per 100 g of body weight. The liver was shown to play a central role in interconverting acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate in the intact rat. In functionally hepatectomized animals the capacity to bring radioactive acetoacetate or β-hydroxybutyrate into equilibrium was virtually abolished while in diabetic animals this capability was enhanced."
https://openalex.org/W1496059814,"Abstract Penicillium chrysogenum will grow on methylamine (methylammonium chloride) as its sole nitrogen source. The amine enters the mycelium by means of a transport system (permease) that satisfies several criteria for its identity as an ammonia (or ammonium ion) permease. Transport is temperature-dependent (Q10 of 2.1 between 20° and 30°), pH-dependent (optimum between pH 4.5 and pH 8.5), and ionic strength-dependent (optimum and relatively constant between 0 and 10-3 m KCl). Methylamine transport by nitrogen-sufficient mycelium is extremely low and obeys first order kinetics up to 10-3 m external substrate. Nitrogen starvation causes the derepression or deinhibition (or both) of a saturable transport system (Km ≃ 10-5 m, Vmax ≃ 10 µmoles per g-min). This results in an 800-fold increase in the rate of methylamine transport at external substrate concentrations below 10-5 m. Ethylamine transport has the same Vmax, but a much higher Km value (approximately 10-4 m). Methylamine transport is not inhibited significantly by other amines, amino alcohols, or amino acids previously shown to be susbtrates of a nitrogen-regulated amino acid permease (Benko, P. V., Wood, T. C., and Segel, I. H., Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 129, 498 (1968)). The amino acid permease and the methylamine permease also do not develop coincidentally during nitrogen starvation, while the choline permease is unaffected by nitrogen starvation. Ammonia (ammonium ion) is a potent competitive inhibitor of methylamine transport (Ki approximately 2.5 x 10-7 m). An independent estimate of the Vmax for ammonium transport, based on the time required to release the inhibition of methylamine-14C transport, gives a value of about 10 µmoles per g-min. Although the original development of transport activity could result from derepression, the permease is subject to feedback inhibition by intracellular glutamine and asparagine."
https://openalex.org/W2260123734,"Abstract The incorporation of 3H-TTP into the DNA of intact nuclei isolated from the livers of normal and partially hepatectomized rats has been studied. The regenerating nuclei incorporate 3H-TTP at about 10 times the rate of normal nuclei. The requirements for a maximal rate of incorporation include the three unlabeled deoxynucleoside triphosphates, ATP, and Mg++. Three pieces of evidence are presented to show that the replication of DNA by the isolated regenerating nuclei is a continuation of the process that was going on in vivo. First, with one exception, a constant relationship exists between the abilities of the nuclei to form DNA in vivo and in vitro after various manipulations of the partially hepatectomized rat. The exception is in the responses of the nuclei after treatment of the rat with cycloheximide. Second, only nuclei that were forming DNA in vivo are able to incorporate 3H-TTP in vitro. Finally, the isolated nuclei use few or no improper sites of initiation of synthesis. Most or all of the DNA formed is added to polydeoxynucleotide strands that were growing in vivo. The possibility is considered that one of the differences between normal and regenerating nuclei is that the nonreplicating nuclei lack sites of initiation for DNA synthesis. Treatment of normal nuclei with pancreatic DNase causes a marked stimulation in 3H-TTP incorporation."
https://openalex.org/W1531183960,"Abstract Chloroplast disc membranes were prepared from Chlamydomonas reinhardi y-1 after etiolated cells were exposed to light and allowed to produce chlorophyll and disc membranes for 8 to 8½ hours in liquid culture. Most, and possibly all, of the disc membrane proteins were synthesized during this period of membrane formation. The following results showed that both chloroplast and cytoplasmic ribosomes were involved in synthesizing these proteins. (a) Inhibition by chloramphenicol of the synthesis of polypeptides by chloroplast ribosomes did not prevent formation of the membrane structure in the cells. These membranes therefore contained primarily polypeptides synthesized in the cytoplasm, which became labeled when 14C-arginine was added to the cell culture along with chloramphenicol. (b) After 8½ hours in the presence of chloramphenicol the cells were transferred to medium containing cycloheximide, which inhibited protein synthesis by cytoplasmic ribosomes and prevented further membrane formation. During the following 2 hours in the light, the existing membranes became labeled when 3H-arginine was added to the culture medium, indicating that polypeptides were synthesized by chloroplast ribosomes and were incorporated into the membranes. The site of synthesis of individual membrane polypeptides was identified in such experiments by the distribution of 14C and 3H in fractions separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Several membrane polypeptides were synthesized apparently only in the chloroplast, whereas most were synthesized in the cytoplasm. Among those synthesized in the cytoplasm were two fractions that together accounted for about 36% of the total protein stain on gels containing membrane proteins from control cells but about 43% of the total protein stain on gels containing membrane proteins from cells treated sequentially with chloramphenicol and cycloheximide. About one-half of the labeled arginine incorporated into protein in the cytoplasm was contained in these two fractions. These fractions were estimated to have molecular weights of 2.1 and 2.4 x 104. During the incubation of the cells in the presence of cycloheximide the density of the membranes decreased from 1.18 g per cm3 to 1.15 to 1.16 g per cm3, apparently as the result of the continued incorporation of lipids into existing membranes under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2249396939,Four glycolipid classes were isolated from mouse fibroblasts (L cells) and accounted for 0.7% of the total cell lipid. Ceramide lactoside was the only neutral glycolipid found and made up 20% of the total glycolipid. Mono- and disialoganglioside accounted for 38% of the cell glycolipid and hematosides containing N-acetylneuraminic and N-glycolylneuraminic acids made up an additional 42%. The L cell glycolipid pattern is similar to that of other fibroblasts but different than that of other extraneural tissues and of brain. Three of the four glycolipids contain predominantly short chain saturated fatty acids while the disialoganglioside contains 45% long chain fatty acids. Mild extraction of cells with 40% aqueous ethanol extracted approximately half of the cell lipid and selectively extracted two of the four glycolipids. Surface membranes of L cells were isolated by the fluorescein mercuric acetate method. Glycolipids accounted for 0.7% of the total membrane lipid. Only the hematosides and disialoganglioside could be found in the surface membranes. Ceramide lactoside and monosialoganglioside must be located in intracellular membranes. It is suggested that glycolipid content and the specific localization of glycolipids may be useful as criteria for the classification of membranes. Extraction of surface membranes with aqueous ethanol solubilized approximately 80% of the total membrane lipid including all of the hematosides. The disialoganglioside could be solubilized only after tryptic digestion of the membrane. Hydrophobic interactions between membrane proteins and specific lipids may be the primary stabilizing forces within the membrane matrix. Surface membrane glycolipids are resistant to neuraminidase activity and may be buried within the membrane matrix or are sterically inaccessible to neuraminidase.
https://openalex.org/W1509925809,"Abstract Cells of Neurospora crassa grown in media containing low levels of glucose produce a transport system which catalyzes the accumulation of l-sorbose against a considerable concentration gradient. This system is physiologically a glucose active transport system which operates maximally at extremely low glucose concentrations (Km for glucose, approximately 10 µm). The active glucose transport system is distinct from a previously described facilitated diffusion glucose transport system which functions at high glucose concentrations (Km for glucose, approximately 8 mm). Only the facilitated diffusion system is present in cells grown on high levels of glucose, whereas the active transport system appears when cells are grown on low levels of glucose. Repression of the high affinity active transport system at high glucose concentrations and derepression of this system at low glucose concentrations provides the organism with an efficient mechanism for maintaining adequate intracellular glucose concentrations regardless of extreme fluctuations in the glucose content of the external environment."
https://openalex.org/W1625576173,"Abstract The alkynoic substrate analogue 3-decynoyl-N-acetylcysteamine (NAC) was previously shown to inhibit β-hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydrase irreversibly. 2,3-Decadienoyl-NAC prepared by chemical isomerization of 3-decynoyl-NAC inhibits dehydrase activity even more effectively. The allenic and the acetylenic inhibitors both inactivate dehydrase by combining with a histidine residue at the active site. α-Dideutero-3-decynoyl-NAC reacts more slowly with dehydrase than its hydrogen analogue: kh:kd = 2.60. No kinetic isotope effect is observed for the inhibition of enzyme by α-d-2,3-decadienoyl-NAC. It is concluded that 3-decynoyl-NAC as such is not the true inhibitor, but that the dehydrase isomerizes it to the allene which in turn inactivates the enzyme by a chemical reaction. The finding that free 2,3-decadienoic acid inhibits dehydrase, whereas 3-decynoic acid does not, supports the postulated mode of action."
https://openalex.org/W1588743614,"Abstract Proteins from a membrane fraction enriched in chloroplast material obtained by density gradient centrifugation were analyzed by electrophoresis on acrylamide gels. About 15 to 20 bands could be resolved. The electrophoretic pattern of the proteins obtained from dark-grown cells, lacking the chloroplast lamellae, differed from that of light-grown photosynthetic cells. When dark-grown cells were exposed to light, a main protein peak designated as L protein appeared parallel to the increase in the chlorophyll content. Continuous labeling and pulse labeling of the proteins during the greening process, in the presence or absence of cycloheximide and chloramphenicol, indicated that the L protein fraction is synthesized de novo; its synthesis is inhibited by cycloheximide but not by the latter compound. Membranes synthesized in the presence of chloramphenicol have a very low photosynthetic activity although a normal amount of L protein is present in the cells. Removal of the inhibitor allows synthesis of new proteins and activation of the defective membranes. This process does not require synthesis of additional L protein or chlorophyll since it is not inhibited by cycloheximide and it can occur in the dark. Pulse labeling of proteins after transfer of greening cells from chloramphenicol to cycloheximide indicates progressive reduction in the labeling of the L protein peak and appearance of radioactivity in other protein peaks which are not labeled in the presence of chloramphenicol. Cycloheximide completely blocks the synthesis of chlorophyll and protein when added at any time during the greening process in a normal noninhibited system. However, prior incubation of the greening cells with chloramphenicol leading to accumulation of L protein protects the system against the complete inhibition exerted by cycloheximide. Based on these data it is suggested that in the process of synthesis and assembly of the photosynthetic membranes, proteins of cytoplasmic and chloroplast origin concur to form a functional membrane. The synthesis of these two types of protein is regulated by a feedback-like mechanism; its features include control of the level of the lamellar proteins of cytoplasmic origin by the level of chlorophyll and control of the level of proteins of chloroplast origin by that of the cytoplasmic proteins. In addition, the light-dependent chlorophyll synthesis is controlled by the level of the lamellar proteins of chloroplasts and cytoplasmic origin."
https://openalex.org/W1508863942,"Abstract Cytidine diphosphate choline or cytidine diphosphate ethanolamine, O-alkylacylglycerol, and Mg++ are essential for the biosynthesis of O-alkyl phospholipids. The phosphorylcholine- or phosphorylethanolamine-O-alkylacylglycerol transferase activities occur in microsomes of preputial gland tumors, and they may be identical with the enzyme (enzymes) that catalyze the analogous steps in the biosynthesis of the corresponding diacylglycerophosphatides."
https://openalex.org/W1574749596,"Abstract The inhibitory effects of trivalent and other metal ions on ferroxidase (ceruloplasmin EC 1.12.3.1.) activity were investigated. All trivalent cations tested inhibited ferroxidase activity but the strongest inhibitors had an ionic radius of 0.81 A or less. The inhibition by Al(III) was found to be mixed competitive and uncompetitive with respect to the substrate, Fe(II). The uncompetitive feature of the inhibition was not due to competition by Al(III) with the other substrate, oxygen. A mechanism for the mixed inhibition by Al(III) is proposed consistent with these results. A comparison of the strong cationic inhibitors provides the following metal ion series in order of decreasing effectiveness of inhibition: In(III) g ZrO(II) g Al(III) g Sc(III) g Ga(III)"
https://openalex.org/W1556184912,"Abstract Glutamate dehydrogenase has been purified and crystallized from rat liver mitochondria and from whole rat liver preparations. No differences in the enzyme prepared by the two different methods have been observed and there is no evidence that more than one glutamate dehydrogenase occurs in rat liver. The pure enzyme has a molecular weight of 350,000 ± 20,000 and consists of six to eight subunits. In contrast to the bovine liver enzyme, rat liver glutamate dehydrogenase does not polymerize to higher molecular weight forms as the enzyme concentration is raised, even in the presence of nucleotides which promote the association of the bovine liver enzyme. Also in contrast to the bovine liver enzyme, the rat liver glutamate dehydrogenase is rather unstable during the assay at low enzyme concentrations. The amino acid composition and peptide maps of the rat and bovine liver enzymes are quite similar, indicating only a few amino acid replacements. The fact that the polymerization of the bovine liver enzyme may be important in the regulation of activity by purine nucleotides in vivo indicates that the rat liver enzyme must differ with respect to such control since polymerization is lacking."
https://openalex.org/W1566054200,"Abstract Menadione reductase from a halophilic bacterium shows a requirement for high concentrations of salt for both activity and stability, reaching maximal value at 2 to 3 m NaCl. Lower concentrations of polyvalent cations, such as Mg+2 and spermine+4, cause partial activity and some increase in stability. There is little difference in effectiveness among monovalent cations as chloride salts. Among anions, as sodium or potassium salts, the order of promoting enzyme activity and stability is Cl-, H2PO4- g Br- g NO3- g ClO4-, SCN-. The enzyme is inhibited by formamide and urea; alkyl substitution increases the effectiveness of these agents. The high salt requirement of this halophilic enzyme is proposed to be due to hydrophobic bonds which are promoted by salting-out salts, but which are disrupted by salting-in salts and other chaotropic agents. In the absence of salt, it is suggested that the enzyme is nearly completely unfolded and is inactive. At low salt concentrations and especially in the presence of polyvalent cations, the enzyme is thought to be in a partially folded conformation, and increased stability is achieved through counterion shielding. As the NaCl concentration is increased above 2 m, the native conformation is reached through the interaction of hydrophobic groups caused by their decreased solubility in the solvent. The hypothesis is supported by thermodynamic data, which show that at 0° the irreversible inactivation of the enzyme in the absence of salt is accompanied by ΔH‡ = +18.4 kcal, ΔS‡ = -6.0 entropy units, while in 3 m NaCl the corresponding parameters are -33.8 kcal and -210.0 entropy units."
https://openalex.org/W1677051152,"Abstract A soluble (105,000 x g supernatant) enzyme preparation from a pseudomonad has been obtained which catalyzes the interconversion of oleic acid and 10d-hydroxystearic acid. Evidence compatible with a mechanism involving a hydration of the double bond is presented. The crude enzyme preparation also catalyzes the formation of Δ10-trans-octadecenoic acid from either oleic acid or 10d-hydroxystearic acid. The enzyme also catalyzes the formation of 10-hydroxypalmitic acid from palmitoleic acid. The enzyme did not catalyze the formation of an olefinic acid from 9d-hydroxystearic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1583392951,"Abstract Protein catabolic activity in rat liver preparations at several levels of tissue intactness has been studied with a variety of metabolic inhibitors. The previous reports that energy inhibitors also inhibit protein catabolism in a liver slice have been confirmed. Some of these same inhibitions, although reduced, were also observed in liver homogenates. However, the ability of several types of inhibitors, including energy or respiratory inhibitors, to inhibit protein catabolism is shown to be dependent on the level of tissue integrity while other inhibitions are not affected greatly by tissue integrity. Addition of carrier amino acid to the incubations is shown to facilitate equilibration with the incubation media containing labeled amino acids released from protein catabolism and the remaining protein, refuting earlier reports that the addition diluted out amino acids for reincorporation of the tracer into new protein. This new evidence requires a re-evaluation of the apparent energy requirement for protein catabolism. There may be a structural component involved in protein catabolism, the integrity of which requires metabolic energy, while the enzymes involved in the actual degradation of proteins probably do not have an energy requirement."
https://openalex.org/W1643305366,"Abstract Lipoamide dehydrogenase (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide:lipoamide oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.4.3) has been isolated from the pig heart 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, the pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, and a pig heart extract which was devoid of the two complexes. Two major molecular forms, designated as Fp-I and Fp-II in order of increasing anodic mobility, were detected in both electrophoretic patterns and triethylaminoethyl-cellulose column chromatograms of these three flavoprotein preparations. Fp-I is the main flavoprotein component of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, and Fp-II is the main flavoprotein component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The uncomplexed form of lipoamide dehydrogenase appears to be a mixture of Fp-I and Fp-II. Ultracentrifugal analyses, absorption spectra, flavin contents, amino acid analyses, end group analyses, peptide mapping, and immunological experiments showed no significant differences between the two forms (Fp-I and Fp-II) of lipoamide dehydrogenase, thereby suggesting the identity of these two molecular forms of the enzyme. Comparison of enzymic activities, thiol contents, electrophoretic patterns after incubation with NADH and arsenite, and optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism spectra of the two forms suggests that these multiple forms may result from conformational differences around the active site, involving thiol groups and FAD. The two forms of lipoamide dehydrogenase are interchangeable with respect to both their function and ability to form the complexes; however, the enzymic, electrophoretic, and circular dichroism properties of OGDC-Fp-I were altered with respect to those of PDC-Fp-II when bound to the specific binding site in lipoate acetyltransferase molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1565345387,"Abstract The hydrodynamic properties of native Escherichia coli pyrophosphatase in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, were as follows: s20,w0 = 7.01 S, D20,w0 = 5.70 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1 (molecular weight by sedimentation-diffusion = 118,000), and [η] = 4.00 cc per g. The molecular weights obtained with high and low speed sedimentation equilibrium techniques were 122,000 and 119,000, respectively. Optical rotatory dispersion measurements gave evidence of little or no α helix structure; there was a small trough at 230.5 mµ. In studies cited in the Appendix, electron micrographs of negatively stained preparations of the enzyme revealed a round object 65 A in diameter. If this object represents a spherical particle, its estimated weight is 117,000 daltons. In mother liquor from which the enzyme had been recrystallized there were, in addition to the 65 A forms, larger, round objects 130 to 140 A in diameter. As the solution pH was lowered from 7 to 5, increasing numbers of these aggregates appeared and at the expense of 65 A particles. When the protein was denatured in 5 m guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) and either alkylated with N-ethylmaleimide or kept reduced with dithiothreitol, the following properties were observed: s20,guhcl0 = 0.595 S, D20,guhcl0 = 3.9 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1 (molecular weight by sedimentation-diffusion = 21,300), and [η] = 21.8 cc per g. The molecular weights determined with high and low speed sedimentation equilibria were 20,600 and 18,300, respectively. The optical rotatory dispersion was similar to that of native enzyme except that the 230.5 mµ trough was abolished. It is concluded that the enzyme is a compact, globular protein consisting of 6 subunits of molecular weight 20,000 each. In 5 m guanidine hydrochloride the subunits behave as randomly coiled, single polypeptide chains."
https://openalex.org/W1559071762,"Abstract Data are presented showing the distribution of 14C and tritium from radioactive tracer experiments with ribose-1-14C, uniformly labeled ribose-14C, ribose-1-3H, ribose-3-3H, uniformly labeled adenosine-14C, and adenosine-14C following their incorporation into the pyrrolopyrimidine nucleoside antibiotic, toyocamycin, elaborated by Streptomyces rimosus. The data clearly show that carbon 2, but not carbon 8, of the purine ring is incorporated into the pyrrolopyrimidine ring of toyocamycin. Carbons 1', 2', and 3' of the ribose moiety of a purine nucleoside or purine nucleotide serve as the carbon source for carbons 6, 5, and the cyano carbon of toyocamycin, respectively. Evidence is presented which shows that two ribose units are covalently bound to the nitrogen attached to carbon 4 of the pyrimidine ring following the expulsion of nitrogen 7 and carbon 8 from the imidazole portion of the purine ring. The distribution of radioactivity in the toyocamycin from the uniformly labeled adenosine-14C and adenosine-14C experiments is consistent with the notion that carbons 1, 2, and 3 of both of these ribose units contribute equally to the biosynthesis of pyrrole carbons 6, 5, and the cyano carbon of toyocamycin, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1562585769,"Abstract The rates of reaction of the (β93) and (α104 and β112) sulfhydryl groups of liganded human hemoglobin with p-mercuribenzoate (PMB) have been studied under a variety of conditions. The presence of PMB on β93 promotes the dissociation of hemoglobin into dimers and the subsequent reaction of the masked sulfhydryls promotes further dissociation into single chains. Decreasing pH and increasing NaCl concentration have opposite effects on the reaction of the masked and free groups. When PMB is in excess, the apparent first order rate constant for the reaction of the masked —SH groups is proportional to the PMB concentration, as would be expected for a simple bimolecular reaction; on the other hand, at sufficiently low values of the hemoglobin concentration, it increases with a decrease of hemoglobin concentration. This suggests that the rate of reaction of the masked —SH groups is controlled by a dissociation process beyond the dimer stage."

The asymmetrical unit contains 1 molecule assuming a molecular weight of 100,000 (6 molecules per unit cell).

https://openalex.org/W2148693734,"Abstract Type L pyruvate kinase from rat liver has been further studied with a more purified preparation (about 400- to 600-fold). The enzyme has an absolute requirement for a monovalent cation (K+ or NH4+). At pH 7.5, there is a sigmoidal velocity response with respect to both univalent cations. In the presence of fructose 1,6-diphosphate or at saturating concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate, the response to K+ concentration is transformed to give a Michaelian curve. On the other hand, K+ has only a slight heterotropic effect on the homotropic cooperativity of the substrate (phosphoenolpyruvate) and of the inhibitor (ATP). The pH exerts a complex influence on the K+ activation kinetics. At acid (6.0) or at very alkaline (8.35) pH values, the cooperativity of K+ decreases markedly. The effect of Mg++ concentration on enzyme activity was also studied."
https://openalex.org/W202602674,"Abstract A soluble (105,000 x g supernatant) enzyme preparation from a pseudomonad which catalyzes the stereospecific hydration of the double bond of a number of cis-Δ9-olefinic fatty acids has been shown to catalyze the stereospecific conversion of cis- and trans-9,10-epoxystearic acids to threo- and erythro-9,10-dihydroxystearic acids, respectively. In both cases only one isomer of each of the incubated racemic substrates was utilized by the enzyme and only one isomer of each of the threo- or erythro-9,10-dihydroxystearates was formed. The results of incubations of the cis- and trans-9,10-epoxystearic acids in water enriched with respect to 18O indicated that the enzyme-catalyzed hydration of the epoxide functions occurred with stereospecific incorporation of the oxygen of water at carbon atom 10.

The pH optimum of the enzyme's activity is 7.8 and enzyme preparations are unstable at temperatures above 55°. The apparent Km for O-phosphorylethanolamine was found to be 6.1 x 10-4. Dialyzed preparations after treatment with hydroxylamine were found to be almost completely dependent on the addition of pyridoxal phosphate. The Km for this cofactor was 2.7 x 10-7 m. Inorganic phosphate was found to be a competitive inhibitor with an apparent Ki of 1.3 x 10-3 m. None of the cations or anions tested was found to be essential for enzyme activity or to have an ability to activate the enzyme. The enzyme was inactivated by heavy metal cations, sulfate ions, and cyanide ions. Inhibition of p-chloromercuribenzoate could be reversed by dithiothreitol. Substrate specificity was tested with a variety of compounds; ethanolamine, ethylphosphate, ethylamine, ethylenimine, and 2-aminoethylphosphonate were not substrates for the enzyme. The approximate molecular weight as estimated by Sephadex G-200 chromatography was 168,000. An Arrhenius plot of enzyme activity showed a discontinuity with the energy of activation being 18,700 calories below 14° and 10,700 calories at higher temperature. By means of O-phosphorylethanolamine labeled with 14C in the amino carbon, it was shown by oxidation and Schmidt degradation of the enzymatically formed acetaldehyde that the 14C was solely in the carbonyl carbon of the product. These data serve to confirm the mechanism of this reaction as an initial β-elimination of Pi of the O-phosphorylethanolamine-pyridoxal phosphate complex. The purpose of this paper is to report the partial purification of the enzyme from liver which catalyzes the reaction H3N+CH2CH2OPO3- (pyridoxal-P)/→ NH4+ + CH2CHO + Pi and to describe some of its physical and chemical properties. In addition, studies utilizing 2-14C-O-phosphorylethanolamine indicate that the mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme is that of a phospho-lyase (Sprinson, D. B., and Weliky, I., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 36, 866 (1969)) rather than an ammonia lyase as was originally indicated (Fleshood, H. L., and Pitot, H. C., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 36, 110 (1969))."
https://openalex.org/W2247748422,"Abstract A homogeneous form of spinach leaf glyoxylic acid reductase has been isolated from commercial crystalline preparations. The enzyme catalyzes the reduction of hydroxypyruvate as well as glyoxylate and has a molecular weight of 97,500 ± 5,000. It is composed of two equal-sized subunits which are dissociated by exposure to 6.0 m guanidine hydrochloride-0.1 m mercaptoethanol, 8.0 m urea-0.1 m mercaptoethanol, or iodoacetate. Analytical disc gel analyses, amino-terminal end group analyses, and peptide mapping indicate that the polypeptide chains of each subunit are similar in their primary structure. The subunits can reassociate to yield the native enzyme and a nearly inactive tetramer. Several additional forms of the enzyme have been shown and characterized. Two of these have the same molecular weight as the above enzyme and a similar amino acid composition; another exhibits a lower molecular weight (83,000 ± 5,000) and a different amino acid content. They can be distinguished from this enzyme by their isoelectric points, stabilities, specific activities, and spectra, yet are also composed of two equal-sized subunits with similar properties of dissociation and reassociation. The lower molecular weight protein is presumed to be a degraded form of the spinach enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1516368079,"Abstract Five mutant strains of Escherichia coli were selected for resistance to the steroid antibiotic fusidic acid. The protein synthetic activity of the cell-free extracts of only one of these was resistant to the inhibitory effect in vitro of the antibiotic. G factor, one of the soluble proteins required for peptide chain elongation, was purified to virtual homogeneity from both sensitive parent and resistant mutant strains. Aside from their differing sensitivity to fusidic acid inhibition, the two G factors were indistinguishable by conventional immunological, chromatographic, and electrophoretic analyses. The two factors differed, however, in two other respects. The specific activity of the sensitive strain was approximately twice that of the resistant strain throughout purification. In addition, the Michaelis constant for the ribosomal dependent hydrolysis of GTP calculated for the sensitive factor was half that for the resistant. The study, therefore, characterizes this fusidic acid-resistant mutation as one affecting G factor and establishes a biochemical basis for further genetic studies. It also suggests that the active enzymatic site for the ribosome-dependent hydrolysis of GTP is associated with the soluble G fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1521234484,"Abstract Hybrid-heme hemoglobins in which one chain contains meso- or deuteroheme and the other chain protoheme, react with CO at a slow rate characteristic of reduced hemoglobin rather than quickly reacting hemoglobin, but at a rate at the protoheme site that is somewhat faster than in all-proto hemoglobin. The rate at the other site containing mesoheme is essentially the same as for protoheme; for deuteroheme, it is about 50% faster. There is a similar increase in the rate when both chains contain protoheme, and the iron is +3 (nonfunctional in CO binding) in one of the chains. The results support a mechanism in which the two hemes react similarly and at random with CO. In experiments with intermediate complex II, a hemoglobin with hemes only in the α chain, the rapid combination rate (4.5 x 106 m-1 sec-1), similar to quickly reacting hemoglobin, is slowed to that characteristic of reduced hemoglobin upon addition of various porphyrins to the β chain heme site. This 20-fold change in rate at the α site (and a presumably large associated conformational change) characteristic of heme-heme interaction in intact hemoglobin, cannot be mediated by bond changes between the iron and the proximal histidine in the β chain."
https://openalex.org/W2164666838,"Abstract A particle-bound enzyme from the fungus imperfectus Cryptococcus laurentii var. flavescens (NRRL Y-1401) mediates transfer of mannosyl units from GDP-mannose to endogenous primer. The enzyme requires divalent cations for activity. The pH optimum is 7.5 and the apparent Km for GDP-mannose is 0.14 mm. A polysaccharide fraction that is associated with the enzyme was found to be similar to a polysaccharide fraction that can be isolated from intact cells or from cell wall preparations by ethylenediamine extraction and fractionation with Cetavlon. Both polysaccharide fractions contain mannose, galactose, arabinose, xylose, and glucose; both are soluble in the presence of Cetavlon. In contrast, an acidic polysaccharide produced by the organism contains mannose, glucuronic acid, and xylose and is Cetavlon-insoluble. The radioactive reaction product that is obtained from GDP-mannose-14C remains particle-bound, but is solubilized with ethylenediamine. The solubilized product is Cetavlon-soluble and nondialyzable. Complete hydrolysis releases mannose as the only 14C-monomer. Structural analyses of acetolysis products of the enzymatic product reveal that mannosyl residues are newly linked to nonreducing ends of the enzyme-bound primer, resulting in α-1,2- and α-1,3-mannosyl-mannose bonds. Comparison of electron micrographs of whole cells or cell wall preparations before and after ethylenediamine extraction suggests that a polymer similar to the enzymatic product resides in the cell wall."
https://openalex.org/W1484931239,"Abstract To investigate the role of specifically bound bicarbonate in the metal-complexing function of transferrin, copper transferrin was prepared both in the presence and absence of bicarbonate ion. The magnetic field and temperature dependence of the solvent proton spin-lattice relaxation rate of solutions of the two complexes were determined. The molar relaxivity R (essentially, relaxation rate per protein concentration) for solutions of copper transferrin is very large at low fields (∼20,000 m-1 sec-1 at 4 Oe) and is highly field-dependent, decreasing to almost zero at 12 kOe. At low field, R is almost temperature-independent over the range 0–45°. Comparison of the results with theory indicates that protons are relaxed by a dipolar interaction with the unpaired electronic spin of Cu2+. The observed relaxivity results from the rapid exchange of a water molecule bound sufficiently close to the copper to be an axial ligand. The magnitude of R at low field for copper transferrin-HCO3 is about one-quarter of that for copper transferrin and also disperses almost to zero at high field. Above 25° the low field value of R has a strong positive temperature dependence. There is no significant variation in R over the pH range 7 to 9.5. The data suggest that, as in the absence of bicarbonate, the protons of water molecules are relaxed by a dipolar interaction with the electron spin of Cu2+, and that bicarbonate binding alters the water exchange rate."
https://openalex.org/W1511320459,"Twenty-three structural analogues of AMP were tested for their ability to activate and bind phosphorylase b in the presence and absence of substrate or protamine sulfate (or both). Michaelis constants, maximal velocities, and inhibition constants were measured by nucleotide activation of phosphorylase b and compared with the corresponding dissociation and inhibition constants measured by nucleotide quenching of a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-associated enzyme fluorescence. The excitation maximum was 347 mµ and the emission maximum was 522 mµ. A sigmoidal saturation curve was obtained for AMP quenching of enzyme fluorescence. This, coupled with the ATP inhibition and the glucose 1-phosphate enhancement of AMP quenching of enzyme fluorescence, identified the site of AMP binding for enzyme fluorescence quenching with the AMP binding site for activation of phosphorylase b. Protamine enhanced the binding of some nucleotides to phosphorylase b but apparently affected only the Vmax of others as measured by nucleotide activation of the enzyme. An increase in enzyme fluorescence associated with addition of ATP and a quenching effect by added AMP or glucose-1-P suggested that the observed quenching was the result of the protein conformational state changes associated with the allosteric properties of the enzyme. Nucleotide analogues of AMP exhibited different heterotropic binding properties with phosphorylase b. Binding studies in the presence and absence of substrate revealed that for some nucleotides the affinity was unchanged while others showed less affinity for enzyme in the presence of substrate. Enzyme activation by bound nucleotide was sensitive to the integrity of both the adenine ring and the 5'-phosphate, but the latter appeared to be the most critical structural feature. Both the 5'-phosphate and purine ring were involved in nucleotide binding."
https://openalex.org/W1560818517,"Abstract Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase and its subunits were examined for their physical characteristics. The intact enzyme was shown to have a molecular weight of approximately 60,000. The smallest apparent subunit was obtained by dissociating the enzyme with sodium dodecylsulfate and the molecular weight obtained was 7,500. Evidence for three partially dissociated forms was obtained; the subunits obtained by urea treatment was 25,000 to 30,000 daltons, the subunits obtained by treatment with maleic anhydride had an apparent molecular weight of 15,000 daltons, and the subunits obtained by the addition of urea and sodium dodecylsulfate together gave molecular weights of 30,000, 22,500, 15,000, as well as 7,500. Dissociation by sodium dodecylsulfate alone (no urea) produced subunits of 7,500 daltons. Therefore we propose that Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase is composed of eight subunits. These are the smallest subunits of an enzyme reported to date. The size of the subunit conflicts with genetic and analytical data presented previously. The intact enzyme can occur in five or more electrophoretic forms. Evidence is presented to show that these forms do not represent dimers or aggregates since they all have the same sedimentation rates."

https://openalex.org/W1514423438,"Abstract The amino acid composition of Escherichia coli pyrophosphatase has been determined and related to the number of peptides obtained after tryptic digestion and after cyanogen bromide treatment. The results indicated the presence of 6 identical subunits in the protein, each containing 20 lysine plus arginine residues and 3 methionines. The NH2-terminal sequence was serine-leucine (isoleucine)-leucine (isoleucine)-, and the COOH-terminal sequence was -alanine-lysine. Quantitative interpretation of the end group data led to the estimate of 6 polypeptide chains per molecule of native enzyme. Each subunit was found to contain 2 residues of cysteine, which in the native protein were inaccessible to sulfhydryl reagents. The proline content of the enzyme was very high (80 moles per 120,000 g of protein), and the serine plus threonine content was exceptionally low (72 moles per 120,000 g of protein). No cofactors nor trace metals were found in the protein."

https://openalex.org/W1624961348,"Abstract Histones F1, F2a, F2b, and F3 were isolated from a human adrenal carcinoma. The fractions were purified by chromatography on carboxymethyl Sephadex and characterized by amino acid analysis and disc electrophoresis. The histones were comparable to calf thymus histones in amino acid composition and electrophoretic patterns. Adrenal carcinoma F3 showed a more complex electrophoretic pattern than calf thymus F3. To study biosynthesis, phosphorylation, and acetylation of histones, adrenal slices were incubated with lysine-3H, Na332PO4, and sodium acetate-14C at intervals between 5 and 120 min. The rate of histone biosynthesis as measured by lysine-3H incorporation was similar for the F1 and F2b fractions and did not increase further after 30-min incubation time. The arginine-rich histone F3 showed the highest rate of lysine-3H uptake, and its biosynthetic rate was about 16 times higher than the rate of F1 biosynthesis. The incorporation of Na332PO4 and sodium acetate-14C increased with time in all histone fractions. The rate of phosphorylation and acetylation as indicated by the specific activities of the histones was similar in the F1, F2a, and F2b fractions. The F3 histone showed the highest rate of 32P and 14C uptake. However, comparison of the acetylation and phosphorylation of the histones in relation to their biosynthetic rate suggests that the turnover of histone-bound phosphate-32P and acetate-14C is faster in the lysine-rich fractions F1 and F2b than in the arginine-rich histones."
https://openalex.org/W1553440498,"Abstract The direction of exonucleolytic degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) by rat liver phosphodiesterase was investigated. 1. When 14C-labeled poly(ADP-ribose) was hydrolyzed with rat liver phosphodiesterase, the concentration of 5'-AMP in the hydrolysate increased in the early stage of hydrolysis and then after 25% hydrolysis remained constant. 2. Poly(ADP-ribose) preparations labeled with 32P in two ways were prepared: poly(ADP-ribose) (I) labeled with 32P at the ribose phosphate derived from the NMN moiety of NAD and (II) labeled with 32P at the AMP portion derived from the AMP moiety of NAD. These two polymers were hydrolyzed 14 to 22% with rat liver phosphodiesterase. Partially hydrolyzed poly(ADP-ribose), named trimmed polymer, was purified by passage through a Sephadex G-50 column. Trimmed polymers were then incubated with Escherichia coli alkaline phosphomonoesterase and radioactive inorganic phosphate released was determined. Three to 6% of the radioactivity of trimmed polymer (I) was recovered as inorganic phosphate, whereas only 0.7% of the radioactivity of trimmed polymer (II) was recovered as inorganic phosphate. 3. Trimmed poly(ADP-ribose) doubly labeled with 32P at the ribose phosphate derived from the NMN moiety of NAD and with 14C in the adenine portion was prepared. After incubation with alkaline phosphomonoesterase and removal of alkaline phosphomonoesterase, it was completely hydrolyzed with venom phosphodiesterase. 2'-(Ribosyl)-5'-AMP was recovered in the hydrolysate but 2'-(5''-phosphoribosyl)-adenosine was not detected. From these results it is concluded that poly(ADP-ribose) is degraded by rat liver phosphodiesterase from the AMP terminus to the other terminus in an exonucleotic fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1565552468,"Abstract Earlier investigations have shown that DNA synthesis in rabbit kidney cortex cells cultured directly from the animal begins after a 30- to 40-hour lag period, and that an apparently related event in the life history of these cells is a relatively abrupt doubling in the over-all rate of RNA synthesis midway through this lag period. The nature of the RNA synthesized at different times during the lag period has now been investigated by sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis. After a 1-hour exposure to 3H-uridine, most of the labeled RNA is located in the nucleus. In cells that have been in culture for 9 hours or less, a large proportion of the RNA labeled in this way is heterodisperse in sedimentation properties. After 25 hours in culture, when the RNA synthesis rate has doubled, the pattern of labeled RNA is characterized by a greatly increased proportion of 45 S and 32 S ribosomal RNA precursor. During a 4-hour chase with unlabeled uridine and actinomycin D, these nuclear precursors are converted to 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNA, and are transported to the cytoplasm. Little change occurs in the level of nuclear heterodisperse RNA at any time during the first 40 hours in culture. Thus, the increase in rate of RNA synthesis occurring during the period preceding DNA replication is primarily due to a considerable acceleration of ribosome production."
https://openalex.org/W68098729,"Abstract The function of pseudouridylic acid and of 4-thiouridylic acid in formylmethionine transfer RNA of Escherichia coli has been explored by cyanoethylation with acrylonitrile. By splitting the molecule into two complementary parts before chemical reaction, it was possible to modify specifically one of these nucleotides without reaction of the other. Recombination of the two fragments reconstituted acceptor activity only when the pseudouridylic acid-containing fragment was unmodified, and the rate of inactivation of this fragment could only be accounted for by reaction of its pseudouridylate residue. On the other hand, cyanoethylation of the 4-thiouridylate-containing fragment did not appreciably affect the methionine-accepting capacity of the recombined fragments. The pseudouridylate residue appears to be important in some way for proper transfer RNA-enzyme recognition but the 4-thiouridylate still has no known function."
https://openalex.org/W1516640809,"Abstract The extent of urea interaction with lysozyme in aqueous solution at various concentrations of urea was shown to equal that previously reported by us for bovine serum albumin (Gordon, J. A., and Warren, J. R., J. Biol. Chem., 243, 5663 (1968)). In the absence of supporting electrolyte, in contrast to albumin, the progressively greater interaction of urea with lysozyme from 3 m to 9 m urea was unaccompanied by significant change in optical rotatory parameters ([m']57820° = -52°, b0 = -142) or intrinsic viscosity ([η]20° = 5.0 cc g-1) of the protein. Lysozyme in water did show a decrease in its intrinsic viscosity to 2.8 cc g-1 and a 10-fold increase in enzymic activity upon the addition of 0.2 m NaCl. Exposure of lysozyme in aqueous 0.2 m NaCl to 8.1 m urea then increased the intrinsic viscosity of the protein to 4.6 cc g-1. Additional studies showed that, when measured by optical rotation, solubility, and sulfhydryl group determination, lysozyme in water was resistant to reduction by 0.09 m 2-mercaptoethanol or 0.02 m dithiothreitol. The further addition of urea induced unfolding of the protein with a forward rate constant dependent upon the 3.9th power of urea, as measured by changes in optical rotation, and a final intrinsic viscosity of 18.7 cc g-1. The appearance of around eight sulfhydryl groups for each completely unfolded lysozyme molecule was shown to be independent of nonspecific solvent, pH, or oxidation-reduction potential effects. The number of urea molecules interacting with each reduced, unfolded lysozyme molecule (1 urea molecule per 2.8 amino acid units) increased over that seen with unreduced, folded lysozyme (1 urea molecule per 3.5 amino acids). The native stability toward mercaptans observed with lysozyme in aqueous acetamide was consistent with the smaller solute-protein interaction and the known poor denaturing ability of this amide. The behavior of lysozyme in aqueous urea and acetamide is consistent with the following conclusions: (a) like serum albumin, the extent of solute-protein interaction is paralleled by some degree of protein perturbation, the latter reflected by lysozyme in change of intrinsic viscosity or disulfide bond stability (or both); (b) unlike serum albumin, the disruption of lysozyme conformation upon interaction with 8 m urea alone is small by the criteria of optical rotatory dispersion and viscometry; (c) the ratio of interaction of urea with reduced and unfolded lysozyme is nearly identical with that found previously with unfolded serum albumin, suggesting common sites of interaction such as peptide groups."

https://openalex.org/W1486012839,"Abstract Escherichia coli pyrophosphatase was inactivated by reaction with reagents which modify the e-amino groups of lysine residues. These reagents included 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), potassium cyanate, diazonium-1H-tetrazole, and the anhydrides of maleic and succinic acids. The enzyme was unaffected by diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate, N-acetylimidazole, and sulfhydryl reagents (N-ethylmaleimide and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate). The inactivation by lysine-modifying agents followed pseudo first-order kinetics with respect to enzyme sites. Detailed analyses with TNBS indicated that interaction of 1 molecule with an enzyme lysine residue led to inactivation with a second-order rate constant of 86 m-1 min-1 in 0.5 m NaHCO3, pH 8.5. Inorganic pyrophosphate, a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme in the absence of divalent cation, partially protected against TNBS inactivation, but kinetic analyses of this effect showed that TNBS could react with the enzyme-pyrophosphate complex, although with a lower rate constant (52 m-1 min-1). These results can be interpreted either in terms of active site modification or effect on a lysine residue apart from the active site but whose integrity is essential for function of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2138657134,"Abstract An NADH-dependent aromatic α-keto acid reductase has been purified from the soluble fraction of rat kidney homogenate by ammonium sulfate precipitation, chromatography on calcium phosphate gel cellulose, and filtration on Sephadex G-100. The purified enzyme exhibited a single homogeneous peak (s20,w020,w = 4.8 S) in an ultracentrifuge and was nearly homogeneous on acrylamide gel disc electrophoresis. Keto acids corresponding to halogenated tyrosines or thyroid hormone are active substrates for this enzyme while aliphatic α-keto acids are not. The properties of this enzyme differ from those of a similar reductase isolated from dog heart. Thus, in reduction reactions with the rat enzyme, NADH, but no NADPH, serves as the hydrogen donor. Inhibition studies indicate that sulfhydryl groups are not necessary for the activity of this enzyme. 3,5-Diiodo-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (diiodosalicylic acid), but not 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, is an inhibitor (competitive type) for the enzyme. The enzyme reaction strongly favors the formation of aromatic α-hydroxy acids. Assuming a molecular weight of 71,000, the enzyme has a molecular activity of 14,600 moles of 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid reduced per mole of enzyme per min at a pH close to the optimum, 6.5. The changes in the fluorescence of NADH or the enzyme protein that occur as a result of complex formation with the enzyme have been utilized in determining the stoichiometry and dissociation constant of the complex. The data indicate that the minimal weight of the enzyme protein, 38,700 g, binds to 1 mole of NADH with the dissociation constant of 0.2 x 10-6 m, and suggest that 1 mole of the enzyme has two binding sites for NADH."

The reconstituted enzyme had a molecular weight and sedimentation-diffusion properties which were indistinguishable from those of native protein. Optical, electrophoretic, and catalytic properties of reconstituted and native enzymes were also identical. If the protein cysteine groups (2 per polypeptide subunit) were allowed to form disulfide bonds, inactive, compact globular structures, about half the size of native protein, were formed upon removal of guanidine hydrochloride. Alkylation of the cysteines with N-ethylmaleimide and subsequent removal of the guanidine salt also yielded an inactive preparation; this appeared to consist of large, asymmetric aggregates of partially unfolded chains."
https://openalex.org/W1604861776,"Abstract GMP 3'-(2')-phosphate solutions were studied with proton magnetic resonance over a range of pH 1.6 to 7.7. It was found that the signal of the protons of the NH2 group appears when the solution gelates (pH 5), indicating that the NH2 group is involved in the binding of the gel. The involvement of N7 as a binding site has been confirmed from results on the disruption of the gel by Cu++ ions, and proton magnetic resonance evidence for stacking is given by the pH dependence of the chemical shift of the H8 resonance. These findings are in agreement with Gellert's model (Gellert, M., Lipsett, M. N., and Davies, D. R., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 48, 2013 (1962)) of the molecular structure of the gel, in which a helical structure is assumed to be formed by stacking of planar tetramers with hydrogen bonds between NH2 and N7 (and between O6 and H1). In addition, the proton magnetic resonance measurements on GMP-Cu(II) solutions at acid pH indicated that Cu(II) interacts with the GMP base even when N7 is protonated. This is supported by results from electron spin resonance measurements where the g factor anisotropy of the electron spin resonance spectra at pH 2 indicates that Cu++ is still involved in complexes at pH 2."
