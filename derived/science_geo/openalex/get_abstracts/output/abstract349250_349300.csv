The various procedures have differed in extraction method and in the reagents used in the color development. The separation of cholesterol from its esters with digitonin has had limited application because of the time and labor required in the involved and delicate technique. The errors which are encountered in the Liebermann-Burchard color reaction of different cholesterol and cholesterol ester methods have been described by Sperry (2). Because of the different methods of extraction in use, the wide range of accepted normal values for total cholesterol, the difficulty of performing cholesterol ester determinations, and the instability of color produced in the Liebermann-Burchard reaction, an investigation of the possible improvement in the method of determination of cholesterol and its ester was undertaken. The method reported has been satisfactorily used over the past 2 years for the determination of several hundred serum cholesterols and cholesterol esters."

https://openalex.org/W149061148,"(Received for publication, March 28, 1949) The blood serum (1) and plasma (2) proteins of various relatively easily accessible animals have been studied previously by the electrophoretic technique. The serum proteins of each species were found to give char- acteristic species variations in mobility, amount, and number of protein components. An electrophoretic study of the blood serum proteins of various animals of relatively lower phylogenetic order has revealed that the same species specificity of the plasma proteins that exists among the higher animals likewise obtains among the lower forms."

The ready availability of the optically active enantiomorphs has made possible the application of the carbobenzoxy method to the synthesis of peptides of Land n-methionine. A search of the literature has indicated that the only methionine peptide described thus far is glycyl-L-methionine (2), which was obtained by the treatment of L-methionine with chloroacetyl chloride, followed by the amination of the resulting chloroacetylamino acid. The rotation of the peptide was not reported, however, and, as is noted in the experimental section of this communication, the melting point of this product is about 55’ lower than that found for glycyl-nmethionine prepared by the carbobenzoxy method. In what follows, there is described the synthesis of a series of methionine peptides and peptide derivatives, and a number of these have been examined with regard to their susceptibility to the hydrolytic action of several proteolytic enzymes. In addition, the availability of such peptides of methionine makes possible the study of other metabolic reactions involving compounds in which this amino acid is bound in peptide linkage. The results of such studies will be reported in future communications. Synth,esis of Peptides of Methionine-In the experimental section, directions are given for the synthesis of the free peptides glycyl-nand n-methionine, Land n-methionylglycine, ru-L-glutamyl-L-methionine, L-"

Because of these reports several laboratories (5) have attempted to reproduce in animals the lesions seen in the human cases but with only partial success. In 1946, Dr. Leroy Gardner (6) noted that the intravenous injection of zinc-beryllium silicate or beryllium oxide into rabbits resulted in the development of osteogenic sarcomas after a latent period as short as 5$ months or as long as 1 year. This observation has been confirmed in this laboratory and will be described in a later paper. Several authors (7-10) have reported that the addition of beryllium carbonate to the diet of young rats led to the development of rachitic changes which have been termed “beryllium rickets.” Extremely low levels of serum phosphate and a marked lowering of the alkaline phosphatase content of the kidney accompanied the development of this lesion. Furthermore, this lesion could not be prevented by cod liver oil or irradiated ergosterol, though Kay and Skill (10) were able to prevent it by the daily parenteral administration of glycerophosphate. These authors think that the lesion, at least in part, is due to the precipitation of beryllium phosphate in the intestine, making the phosphate unavailable for absorption. However, Sobel, Goldfarb, and Kramer (11) in studying in vitro the calcifying power of ordinary rachitic bone and beryllium rachitic bone in normal serum noted a markedly diminished calcifying power in the latter compared to the former. They also noted that, although the addition of viosterol to the beryllium rachitogenic diet produced a rise in the calcium and phosphorus product in the serum, the rickets was not prevented and the defect in the calcifying power in vitro was still present. This work suggested that in addition to the factor of poor absorption of phosphate from the intestine there was also a local factor which interfered with calcification. In 1943, Hyslop et al. (12) presented evidence that beryllium tends to be stored in bone."

https://openalex.org/W1535624597,"Little is known of the mechanism of biosynthesis of histidine. The occurrence of the imidazole ring in both histidine and the purine bases suggests a relationship between these metabolites. It was early found that ingestion of histidine increased the excretion of allantoin in rats, and on this basis it was postulated that histidine might serve as a precursor of the purine bases (1, 2). More recent experiments, however, seem to exclude this possibility (3-5). The converse relationship, i.e. that the purine bases might serve as precursors of histidine, was envisaged (6), but no evidence in support of this idea was found, since rats failed to show increased growth when purine bases were added to a histidine-free ration 63. Appropriate studies with Lactobacillus arabinosus showed that under appropriate conditions histidine and purine bases showed a common effect in promoting growth. Further studies of this phenomenon with several bacteria fail to support the view that histidine functions as a precursor for synthesis of purine bases, but indicate strongly that the purine bases do serve as precursors in the synthesis of histidine. Vitamin Bs is required for synthesis of histidine in these organisms; data given below demonstrate that it is necessary for conversion of imidazolepyruvic acid to histidine."

https://openalex.org/W1590409332,"The preparation of isotopically labeled nucleic acid was undertaken to provide material for a study of nucleic acid metabolism and a source of labeled nucleotides and nucleosides, which are otherwise unavailable. For this purpose yeast was propagated in a manner found to produce a rich source of nucleic acid (1) on a medium supplying excess N15 in the form of ammonium sulfate. Nucleic acid was isolated by adapting the method of Redfern (2) to laboratory usage. From the nucleic acid were isolated adenine picrate, guanine sulfate, and silver pyrimidines. The isolated purines and pyrimidines contained essentially identical amounts of isotopic nitrogen (Table I). This level was slightly lower than the N15 content of the nucleic acid sample and was considered indicative of contamination of the nucleic acid sample by some proteinaceous material. The residual yeast (from which nucleic acid was extracted) showed a higher N16 content than did the nucleic acid. This could be attributed to the fact that there was proportionately more protein produced during the growth period, since the seed yeast contained 7.22 per cent nucleic acid (dry basis), whereas the final yeast contained only 6.37 per cent nucleic acid (dry basis). The molasses employed for the yeast propagation contained 20.93 gm. of nitrogen. It was calculated from the isotope analyses that 3.99 gm. (19.0 per cent) of this nitrogen was assimilated by the yeast."

https://openalex.org/W71811019,"In 1944, Taurog et al. (1) pointed out that practically all of the phospholipides in plasma of man and dog contain choline. This indicates that the plasma phospholipides of these two species consist almost entirely of lecithins and sphingomyelins. Confirmation of this finding has now come from Hack (2) and from Sinclair (3-5). The former reported that about 95 per cent of the phospholipides in the serum of normal human subjects are choline-containing and Sinclair found that 3 to 8 per cent of the plasma phospholipides in man, dog, beef, and pig are cephalins. The composition of plasma phospholipides of the bird differs, however, from that of the mammal. Thus, Flock and Bolhnan (6) reported that only 53 per cent of the plasma phospholipides of the domestic fowl are choline-containing, whereas Sinclair (3-5) has shown that in turkey serum no more than 80 per cent of the phospholipides are of this type. By combining two methods, (1) that developed by Taurog et al. (7) for separating choline-containing and non-choline-containing phospholipides by permanent adsorption of the latter upon MgO and (2) that of Schmidt et al. (8), based on the selective destruction of lecithins in a solution of choline-containing phospholipides, it became possible to measure separately the concentrations of lecithins, cephalins, and sphingomyelins in tissues. These methods were used in an earlier study dealing with dog tissues (9) and in the present investigation they have been applied to a study of plasma phospholipides of the domestic fowl. In order to investigate further the metabolic significance of the three types of phospholipides found in the bird, the plasma of the domestic fowl injected with stilbestrol was also examined. This procedure has been shown to induce a lipemia not only in the non-laying female bird but also in the male bird (10)."

https://openalex.org/W131360402,"In much of the work on phosphorus metabolism in plants and animals, primary attention has been focused on the P which is easily extracted with cold acid. However, such an extraction procedure usually removes only about one-half of the total P contained in many tissues (1, 3, 8, 11). As a result of recent work with radioactive P32, it has become increasingly apparent that the acid-insoluble P is subject to rapid turnover and hence is of interest in P metabolism. For example, Gest and Kamen (4) have shown with Chlmella hhat there is rapid turnover of the acid-insoluble P and that the rate of turnover is markedly accelerated during photosynthesis. Our own work, which will be presented elsewhere, indicates that auxin influences the rate of turnover of the acid-insoluble P during the growth of oat coleoptiles. It becomes of interest, therefore, to determine the nature of the substances in which such acid-insoluble P is found. Various attempts have been made to characterize the bound P in tissues (5, S), and as a result the general current view is that a large proportion of such P is bound to proteins, although there is little direct experimental evidence to suggest what proteins are the responsible agents. In a study of 2’ metabolism of green spinach leaves (ll), it was found that almost onehalf of the total P contained in leaves is acid-insoluble. Further investigation revealed that a large part of the bound P is associated with a bulk prot’ein of spinach cytoplasm. This protein, Fraction I, constitutes about 75 per cent of the i,otal cytoplasmic proteins, is electrophoretically homogeneous, contains 0.3 per cent total P, and has t.he enzymatic properties of a phospha.tase (10). The 1’ present in Frnct,ion I protein can be separated from the protein into two distinct, subfractions (11). When the purified protein is precipit,ated wh trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and irreversibly denat,ured as a consequence, about 50 per cent of the t,otal protein P is freed into t,he clesr Supernatant T which remains after removal of the protein by cent,rifuging. The cold acid extraction comes to an end-point, since a second identical treatment removes less than 8 per cent as much P as the first. Extending the extraction period for as long as 8 hours does not sig-"
https://openalex.org/W2061955113,"RECENT studies1 of the mobility ('metallic' character) of the unsaturation electrons within molecules containing conjugated double-bond systems suggest that solid conjugated compounds should exhibit the phenomenon of photoconductivity, provided that the unsaturation electrons can acquire enough energy to penetrate the potential barriers between adjoining molecules in the crystal lattice. Photoconductivity has, in fact, been observed in proteins2 and in certain dyes3. We have found that both naphthalene and anthracene, when melted and allowed to solidify between two platinum electrodes about 0·5 mm. apart, show weak photoconductivity when exposed in vacuo to the unfiltered radiation from a quartz mercury-vapour lamp. With applied voltages between 50 and 360, the photocurrents are detectable with a good galvanometer. They are of the order of magnitude of 10-8 amp., and are superimposed on a rather variable dark current. As in the case of dyes3, the photocurrents are quenched if air is admitted to the system."

https://openalex.org/W2074979432,"AN analysis of the composition of cosmic rays at an altitude of 3,250 m. above sea-level (Alagez) which we carried out in 1946 revealed the existence of a noticeable number of particles with masses exceeding that of the meson. This result was obtained by applying a direct method of determining the mass of fast particles, according to their deflexion in a magnetic field and their range as found by absorption experiments. It was shown that almost 10 per cent of the particles of the cosmic rays have masses lying between 250 and 2,000 electron masses. These results were published in Russian in December 19461 and in English in January 19472. We suggested calling this group of elementary particles 'varytrons', stressing in this way the diversity of masses of the new particles. A month later, in February 1947, in an article in English3, we presented some evidence which proved that there exist in the cosmic rays positive and negative particles which are heavier than the proton, their masses being as high as 5,000 me. All these results were also published in Russian in the C.R. (Doklady) of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R.4 and in more detail in June 19475."
