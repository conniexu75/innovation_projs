https://openalex.org/W2041505869,"Protein folding is inherently a heterogeneous process because of the very large number of microscopic pathways that connect the myriad unfolded conformations to the unique conformation of the native structure. In a first step towards the long-range goal of describing the distribution of pathways experimentally, Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been measured on single, freely diffusing molecules. Here we use this method to determine properties of the free-energy surface for folding that have not been obtained from ensemble experiments. We show that single-molecule FRET measurements of a small cold-shock protein expose equilibrium collapse of the unfolded polypeptide and allow us to calculate limits on the polypeptide reconfiguration time. From these results, limits on the height of the free-energy barrier to folding are obtained that are consistent with a simple statistical mechanical model, but not with the barriers derived from simulations using molecular dynamics. Unlike the activation energy, the free-energy barrier includes the activation entropy and thus has been elusive to experimental determination for any kinetic process in solution."

Their properties are strongly influenced by the spin structure in the vortex core. We have used spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy on nanoscale iron islands to probe for the first time the internal spin structure of magnetic vortex cores. Using tips coated with a layer of antiferromagnetic chromium, we obtained images of the curling in-plane magnetization around and of the out-of-plane magnetization inside the core region. The experimental data are compared with micromagnetic simulations. The results confirm theoretical predictions that the size and the shape of the vortex core as well as its magnetic field dependence are governed by only two material parameters, the exchange stiffness and the saturation magnetization that determines the stray field energy."

https://openalex.org/W1983644317,"A metallocofactor containing iron, sulfur, copper, and nickel has been discovered in the enzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA (coenzyme A) synthase from Moorella thermoacetica (f. Clostridium thermoaceticum). Our structure at 2.2 angstrom resolution reveals that the cofactor responsible for the assembly of acetyl-CoA contains a [Fe4S4] cubane bridged to a copper-nickel binuclear site. The presence of these three metals together in one cluster was unanticipated and suggests a newly discovered role for copper in biology. The different active sites of this bifunctional enzyme complex are connected via a channel, 138 angstroms long, that provides a conduit for carbon monoxide generated at the C-cluster on one subunit to be incorporated into acetyl-CoA at the A-cluster on the other subunit."

During osmotic and oxidative stress, cation chloride cotransporters, e.g. Na-K-2Cl and K-Cl cotransporters, are activated to maintain fluid/ion homeostasis. Here we report the interaction of the stress-related serine-threonine kinases Ste20-relatedproline-alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress response 1 (OSR1) with the cotransporters KCC3, NKCC1, and NKCC2 but not KCC1 and KCC4. The interaction was identified using yeast two-hybrid assays and confirmed via glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments. Evidence for in vivo interaction was established by co-immunoprecipitation of SPAK from mouse brain with anti-NKCC1 antibody. The interacting region of both kinases comprises the last 100 amino acids of the protein. The SPAK/OSR1 binding motif on the cotransporters consists of nine residues, starting with an (R/K)FX(V/I) sequence followed by five additional residues that are essential for binding but for which no consensus was found. Immunohistochemical analysis of choroid plexus epithelium revealed co-expression of NKCC1 and SPAK on the apical membrane. In contrast, in choroid plexus epithelium from NKCC1 null mice, SPAK immunostaining was found in the cytoplasm. We conclude that several cation chloride co-transporters interact with SPAK and/or OSR1, and we hypothesize that this interaction might play a role during the initiation of the cellular stress response.

Environmental change in a variety of physiological contexts elicits cellular responses via the activation of cell surface receptors. Depending on the nature of the stimulus, different protein families are involved. Osmotic and oxidative changes, for instance, have been shown to activate cation chloride cotransporters as well as stress signaling pathways. Cation chloride cotransporters are intrinsic membrane proteins that move Na+, K+, and Cl− ions across plasma membranes in a tightly coupled electroneutral fashion. They mediate secondary active transport and are driven by the gradients generated by the Na+/K+-ATPase. The cation chloride cotransporter family consists of at least seven members. A group of three Na+-dependent inward cotransporters comprises one Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC) 1The abbreviations used are: NCC, Na-Cl cotransporter; NKCC1 and -2, Na-K-2Cl cotransporters; KCC1-4, K-Cl cotransporters; SPAK, Ste20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase; OSR1, oxidative stress response 1; PP1, phosphatase 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; GCK, germinal center kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PASK, proline-alanine-rich Ste20-related kinase. and two Na-K-2Cl cotransporters (NKCC1 and -2). Na+-independent outward transport of K+ and Cl− is mediated by four K-Cl cotransporters (KCC1–4) with distinct functional properties (KCC1 (1Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush B.I. J. Biol.

Relevant functions of the cotransporters include: 1) epithelial transport such as Na+ reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle and distal convoluted tubule of the kidney, K+ reabsorption in choroid plexus, K+ secretion in the inner ear, and Cl− secretion in the sweat and salivary glands, intestine, and airway epithelia; 2) regulation of Cl− gradient and thereby modulation of excitability of neurons in both the central and peripheral nervous systems; and 3) cell volume regulation (reviewed in Refs. 5Haas M. Forbush B.I. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 515-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 6Russell J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 7Delpire E.

Several lines of evidence also suggest a role for cation chloride cotransporters in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation, especially for NKCC1 (9Matthews J.B. Hassan I. Meng S. Archer S.Y. Hrnjez B.J. Hodin R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2072-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Panet R. Marcus M. Atlan H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) but also for KCC3 (11Shen M.-R. Chou C.-Y. Hsu K.-F. Liu H.-S. Dunham P.B. Holtzman E.J. Ellory J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14714-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Identification of proteins that directly interact with cation chloride cotransporters and thereby regulate or mediate their activity is important to understand their different physiological functions. However, the sole evidence for direct protein interaction comes from a study that showed in vitro phosphorylation of NKCC1 by the stress-related kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (12Klein J.D. Lamitina S.T. O'Neill W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 46: C425-C431Crossref Google Scholar). Additionally, strong conclusive evidence for the interaction of phosphatase 1 (PP1) with NKCC1 is provided by mutation studies of the PP1 motif in heterologous expression studies (13Darman R.B. Flemmer A. Forbush B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34359-34362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Here we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to search for key proteins that interact with cation chloride cotransporters. We identified the serine-threonine kinases SPAK and OSR1 as direct interactors of several members of the cation chloride cotransporter family. The interaction was substantiated by GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation studies. Furthermore, we provide immunohistochemical evidence for the interaction by a colocalization experiment in brain sections. The results presented here support a possible role for the cation chloride cotransporter's interaction with the stress kinases as an initial sensor in the oxidative and/or osmotic stress response pathway. The amino terminus of KCC3a (N′KCC3) was amplified by PCR from mouse brain cDNA using a sense primer that contained an EcoRI site and an antisense primer that contained a stop codon followed by aBamHI site. The fragment was fused to the Gal4 binding domain in the pGBDUc2 vector and transformed into PJ69-4A cells (14James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) according to standard yeast handling procedures (Yeast Handbook, Clontech). Yeast cells that contained N′KCC3-pGBDUc2 were transformed with a mouse brain library in pACTII (Clontech). A total of 13 × 106clones was screened. The first round of nutritional selection was carried out on −Ura−Leu−Ade plates, and in the second and third round clones were restreaked on triple dropout (−Ura−Leu−His) + 2 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole plates. β-Galactosidase activity of the surviving clones was tested in a liquid assay. Yeast cells were lysed with 10 units of lyticase (Sigma) in lysis buffer (1.2m sorbitol, 100 mmNaH3PO4, pH 7.4), and clones were PCR amplified using pACTII-specific primers with AmpliTAQ Gold or the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to manufacturer instructions. Amplified fragments were sequenced with ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Shortened KCC3a-bait constructs were made by PCR usingEcoRI- or BamHI-containing primers or for shorter constructs (40 bp or less) by using annealed oligonucleotides (adapters) with the same restriction sites. For the kinase (fish) constructs, EcoRI and XhoI sites were added to PCR primers or to adaptors to allow for subcloning into pACTII. Small scale transformations of PJ69-4A yeast were performed to test for interaction between specific bait and fish constructs. Interaction was tested on triple dropout (−Ura−Leu−His) + 2 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole plates; transformation efficiency was tested throughout on double dropout (−Ura−Leu) control plates. The regulatory domain of SPAK was PCR-amplified from the library clone in pACTII using a sense primer that contained a KpnI restriction site and part of the HA epitope sequence and an antisense primer that contained 23 bp specific to SPAK, a stop codon, and an XbaI restriction site. The PCR fragment was purified, digested with KpnI andXbaI, and ligated into pcDNA3 at theKpnI-XbaI sites. The vector was transfected into HEK293 cells using Fugene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (15Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) 48 h post-transfection, incubated on ice for 60 min, passed through a 26-gauge needle, and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. HEK293 lysates were used in GST pull-down assays. KCC3 constructs were inserted into the vector pGEX4T-1 at the EcoRI andBamHI sites. GST fusion proteins were expressed in protease-deficient BL21 Escherichia coli, immobilized on GST-Sepharose beads, and incubated with HEK293 cell lysates. After several washes, proteins were eluted with glutathione and subjected to Western blot analysis. Anti-HA antibody (mouse monoclonal, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used at a dilution of 1:1000. Brains from adult C57BL6 mice were homogenized in 10-ml lysis buffer that contained 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100 protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Homogenates were incubated on ice for 20 min, sonicated for 5 s, incubated on ice for an additional 2 h, and spun at 1100 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was stored at −80 °C in 500-μl aliquots. Before immunoprecipitation the volume of the brain aliquots was increased to 1 ml by adding 500 μl of fresh lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitation was achieved by adding 20 μl of anti-NKCC1 antibody (16Kaplan M.R. Plotkin M.D. Brown D. Hebert S.C. Delpire E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) or 10 μl of anti-SPAK antibody to the brain sample under gentle rotation overnight at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 30 μl of Protein A/G Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), for 2 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer (centrifugation at 4 °C, 2000 rpm, 2 min). The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 60 μl of loading buffer that contained 5% β-mercaptoethanol, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Protein samples (brain lysates, eluates, or immunoprecipitates) were denatured in SDS-PAGE loading buffer at 37 °C for 30 min and separated on a 9% polyacrylamide gel. The gels were electroblotted onto polyvinylidine fluoride membranes, and membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in blocking solution (5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST)). Incubation of primary antibody was performed overnight at 4 °C at 1:1000 dilution in blocking solution. Membranes were washed in TBST for 3 h, incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in blocking solution (1:4000) for 1 h at room temperature, and washed again for 2 h in TBST. Protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL plus,Amersham Biosciences). A 133-amino acid peptide (residues 424 to 556) of the mouse SPAK was fused to GST. The fusion protein was grown in E. coli and purified with glutathione-coupled Sepharose beads. The peptide was then cleaved from GST using thrombin. Polyclonal antibodies were produced by subcutaneous injections of the SPAK-specific peptide (133-amino acid residues) into two New Zealand White rabbits (Covance, Denver, PA). The antiserum from the first production bleed was affinity-purified as described previously (17Pearson M., Lu, J. Mount D.B. Delpire E. Neuroscience. 2001; 103: 483-493Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because sequence alignment between SPAK and OSR1 showed some degree of conservation in the region chosen to generate the antibody, cross-reaction tests were performed with the purified antibody on GST-OSR1 and GST-SPAK fusion proteins at different concentrations. These tests showed that the purified antibody has an affinity two orders of magnitude higher for SPAK than for OSR1 (data not shown). Brains from adult wild-type and NKCC1 null mice were dissected and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS at 4 °C. Salivary glands were dissected from an adult wild-type mouse that had been perfused with ice-cold PBS for 5 min and 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, pH 7.4, for 20 min. Salivary glands were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS at 4 °C for 2 h. Tissues were then cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in PBS for a minimum of 14 h. Brain sections (10 μm) that contained choroid plexus or salivary gland sections (14 μm) were thaw-mounted on Superfrost Plus slides. Sections were permeabilized with 1% SDS in a PBS solution that contained 8% β-mercaptoethanol, washed in PBS, blocked for 30 min at room temperature with 4% goat serum/1% bovine serum albumin/PBS followed by incubation with SPAK affinity-purified antibody, NKCC1 affinity-purified antibody (16Kaplan M.R. Plotkin M.D. Brown D. Hebert S.C. Delpire E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (both at a dilution of 1:200), or anti-Na/K pump α-subunit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) at a dilution of 1:100 in 1% bovine serum albumin/4% goat serum/PBS, overnight at 4 °C. After being washed in PBS, slides were incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:800 in PBS at room temperature in the dark. They were subsequently washed with PBS and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). As controls, additional brain sections from wild-type and NKCC1 null mice were stained with hematoxylin-eosin according to standard protocols and mounted with VectaMount (Vector Laboratories). Sections were analyzed with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope equipped with an Optronics DEI-750 color CCD camera (Optronics Engineering, Goleta, CA). During our analysis of yeast two-hybrid clones that survived three rounds of nutritional selection (see “Experimental Procedures” for details), we performed liquid LacZ assays on 90 clones. Of 32 clones that had a LacZ value higher than 1, one clone was remarkably high with a β-galactosidase activity value of 27 compared with the next highest value of 5.4 (data not shown). Sequence analysis revealed that this clone represents the regulatory domain (or binding domain) of the serine-threonine kinase SPAK, which was first cloned from rat brain by Ushiro et al. (18Ushiro H. Tsutsumi T. Suzuki K. Kayahara T. Nakano K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). On the basis of its structure, with a regulatory domain located at the carboxyl terminus and the catalytic domain located at the amino terminus, SPAK can be classified within the germinal center kinase (GCK) subgroup, the prototype of which is SPS1 (Fig. 1 A). A GenBankTM search identified a closely related kinase, OSR1 (accession number AB017642), that shares an overall 67% identity with SPAK (accession number NM_019362). The OSR1 gene was originally identified on chromosome 3 through a search for genes involved in tumor suppression (19Tamari M. Daigo Y. Nakamura Y. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). OSR1 and SPAK have a similar structure. The amino acid identity is highest within the catalytic domain (80%) and lowest in the regulatory domain (56%) because of the insertion of a unique segment in the middle of the OSR1 regulatory domain. To further identify the region of SPAK that binds to KCC3a, we tested SPAK constructs of reduced sizes with KCC3a in yeast two-hybrid assays. The length of the constructs is shown in Fig. 1 B. Shortening the regulatory domain at the 5′ end by 82 amino acids and leaving a fragment of 122 residues preserved the interaction (SPAK D). In contrast, curtailing the 3′ end by only 17 amino acids abolished the interaction (SPAK F). Thus, the very carboxyl terminus of SPAK is essential for the binding of SPAK to KCC3a. The smallest fragment that tested positive for interaction encompassed the amino acids 460–556 (SPAK E). In addition, we found that the region of OSR1 that is homologous to SPAK E also interacted with KCC3a in yeast two-hybrid assays. Similarly, we identified the amino acids of KCC3a that provide the site of KCC3 interaction with the kinase (Fig. 2 A). We created KCC3a constructs of reduced sizes in the vector pGBDUc2 and demonstrated that the smallest fragment that interacted with SPAK included nine amino acids (bait P, residues 14–22 of KCC3a). Despite a very low level of conservation among the amino termini of cation chloride cotransporters, we found some homology of the interacting region of KCC3 in other members of the cation chloride superfamily: KCC1, KCC3b, KCC4, NKCC1, and NKCC2. Of significance is the presence of conserved phenylalanine and valine residues in all aforementioned cotransporters (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, no similar conservation was found in KCC2 and NCC. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we tested for the ability of these conserved sequences to interact with SPAK and OSR1. For both kinases, interaction occurred with KCC3b, NKCC1, and NKCC2 but not with KCC1 and KCC4 (Fig. 2 B). For NKCC2, we tested an 18-amino acid fragment and subsequently two smaller fragments of 10 (Fig. 2 B) and 9 amino acids, respectively. All of them interacted with SPAK and OSR1 with the same strength. This analysis suggests that the stress-related kinases SPAK and OSR1 interact with several members of the cation chloride superfamily with the same specificity and that nine amino acids are sufficient to ensure interaction. We next addressed the question of which of the nine amino acids are essential for the interaction by introducing point mutations at each position (alanine scanning of KCC3 and NKCC2). For both KCC3a and NKCC2 the interaction with SPAK or OSR1 in yeast two-hybrid assays was lost after mutations at positions 1, 2, and 4 (Arg, Phe, and Val). At position 5, the mutation of the serine residue in NKCC2 but not of histidine in KCC3a abolished binding. Mutations into alanine at positions 6, 8, and 9 reduced yeast survival, whereas substitutions at position 3 and 7 did not affect the interaction. Further shortening of the motif from either the 5′ or 3′ end led to the loss of interaction, which indicates that the five amino acids downstream of the RFXV motif are necessary for the interaction. Delineation of a consensus motif for positions 5–9 by comparing interacting and noninteracting members of the cotransporter family appears to be difficult, and no simple consensus could be found. These data are summarized in the scheme in Fig. 3 A. Also included in this scheme are results from additional single amino acid substitutions with conserved properties. Substitution of the basic arginine (R) into a lysine (K) at position 1 or of the hydrophobic valine (V) into isoleucine (I) at position 4 did not prevent interaction. However, substitution of the positively charged residue at position 1 into a negatively charged glutamate (E) prevented interaction (Fig. 3 A). Finally, we also tested the directionality of the motif by reversing the sequence of KCC3a. We failed to detect any growth of yeast colony, which indicates that the reversed motif does not promote the interaction (data not shown). To estimate the overall frequency of the minimal SPAK-binding motif (R/K)FX(V/I), we performed a comprehensive data base search of protein families. Considering the frequency of the natural occurrence of each amino acid in proteomes, we calculated that on average, the motif should be found once in every 1833 amino acids. In all protein families tested, the motif was less frequent than the theoretically calculated average. On average, for all 13,730 proteins analyzed, the (R/K)FX(V/I) motif was found once in every 4500 residues (shown as a black square in Fig. 3 B). Most interesting is the finding that cation chloride cotransporters carry the motif with the highest frequency among all protein families tested. We also tested how often the reversed motif was represented within the cation chloride cotransporters. This noninteracting motif was found with a lower frequency (on average, once in every 7200 amino acids, as indicated by the white circle in Fig. 3 B). After demonstrating interaction between several cation chloride cotransporters and the stress kinases SPAK and OSR1 and identifying the binding sites using yeast two-hybrid studies, we confirmed the interaction in yeast-independent systems. Using GST pull-down experiments, we tested the ability of bait A, bait L, and a mutant of bait L, each fused to GST, to interact in vitro with an HA-tagged SPAK fragment. As shown in Fig. 4 A, both bait A (84 amino acids) and the shorter bait L (14 amino acids) immobilized the kinase, whereas a mutated version of bait L (substitution of phenylalanine to alanine) did not, which indicates that the interaction is not the result of mere overexpression of the proteins. These data constitute an initial confirmation of the specific interaction of SPAK and the KCC3 cotransporter and are consistent with our previous yeast two-hybrid data showing that a phenylalanine to alanine mutation in bait L abolished the interaction. We generated a polyclonal antibody directed against residues 424–556 of SPAK. The antibody was first characterized by Western blot analysis. As indicated in Fig. 5 A, an ∼60 kDa band was observed in a mouse brain sample using immune serum but not preimmune serum. After purification of the antibody with the SPAK-specific peptide, a single band is observed (lane 3 in Fig. 5 A). Because, as indicated under “Experimental Procedures,” the SPAK antibody can also recognize OSR1 but only with low affinity, we used the SPAK antibody in all further assays at low concentrations to ensure specificity. To establish the subcellular localization of SPAK, we performed cellular fractioning experiments on brain tissue and detected SPAK in both the membrane fraction (microsomes) and the cytoplasmic (soluble) fraction (Fig. 5 B). Both fractions were also treated with Triton X-100 to further favor the dissociation of SPAK from other proteins (e.g. cytoskeleton). As shown in Fig. 5 B, the signal remained in the membrane fraction after Triton X-100 treatment, which suggests that a large fraction of SPAK is tightly bound to membrane structures. Although the HA-SPAK fusion protein is expressed in a eukaryotic cell system (HEK293 cells) in the GST pull-down assay, the interacting complex is in fact formed in vitro. This leaves the possibility that the interaction is artifactual and does not occur under physiological conditions. To address this concern, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments from brain tissue that guarantee that the SPAK-cotransporter complex was preformed in vivo. We used anti-NKCC1 to immunoprecipitate the cotransporter from mouse brain and from choroid plexus and anti-SPAK for the immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 5 C, we detected SPAK in the immunoprecipitate from brain (lane 2), and to a lesser extent from choroid plexus (lane 1). Along with the co-immunoprecipitation, we ran anti-SPAK immunoprecipitate from mouse brain and microsomal protein from mouse brain, as well as the SPAK antibody alone. This enabled us to identify the band for SPAK unequivocally and distinguish it from the IgG band of the antibody (shown in lanes 3–5, Fig. 5 C). These data confirm the presence of SPAK-cotransporter interaction in vivo. Because Johnstonet al. (24Johnston A.M. Naselli G. Gonez L.J. Martin R.M. Harrison L.C. Deaizpurua H.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4290-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) have shown that SPAK exclusively phosphorylates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) but not extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) or JNK-MAPK, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation experiment using the anti-SPAK antibody to address the question of whether p38 associates with SPAK. We confirmed the position of p38 by direct Western blot analysis of brain lysate with anti-p38 antibody (Fig. 5 D, lane 1). Lane 2 shows the result of the co-immunoprecipitation with anti-SPAK (Fig. 5 D), which yielded a 40-kDa band that corresponded in size with the band inlane 1. Choroid plexus cells show a distinct pattern of NKCC1 expression on the apical membrane, whereas the basolateral membrane is devoid of signal (Fig. 6 A). Given the very high expression level of NKCC1 on the apical membrane of choroid plexus, we tested the expression of SPAK in this epithelium. Using anti-SPAK antibody we demonstrated that SPAK immunolabels the apical membrane but not the basolateral membrane of choroid plexus epithelial cells (Fig. 6 C). Hence, this expression pattern closely matches that of NKCC1. Of significance is the observation that in choroid plexus from NKCC1 knock-out mice (20Delpire E., Lu, J. England R. Dull C. Thorne T. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), which completely lacks a signal for NKCC1 (Fig. 6 B), SPAK immunostaining is found solely in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6 D). To assess the integrity of the choroid plexus cells in NKCC1 null mice compared with wild-type mice, we stained brain sections with hematoxylin-eosin. No significant differences in morphology were observed between the choroid plexi of the two genotypes (Fig. 6, E and F). Because the lack of NKCC1 expression could potentially affect the membrane expression of other proteins, we examined the localization of the Na/K pump. Like NKCC1, the Na/K pump is expressed exclusively at the apical membrane of choroid plexus epithelial cells (Fig. 6 G). Localization of the Na/K pump was not affected in the NKCC1 knock-out mouse (Fig. 6 H). We then examined the expression pattern of SPAK in the salivary gland, a Cl−-secreting epithelium that expresses NKCC1 at the basolateral membrane (5Haas M. Forbush B.I. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 515-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 6Russell J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). In this tissue the NKCC1 antibody strongly labels the basolateral membrane of the epithelial cells (Fig. 7 A). Similarly, immunostaining for SPAK was found to be restricted to the basolateral membranes (Fig. 7 B). The apical membranes, which face the secretory ducts and constitute only a small portion of total membrane surface, were devoid of NKCC1 and SPAK staining. Together the choroid plexus and salivary gland data demonstrate localization of SPAK at epithelial membranes that strongly express NKCC1. Furthermore, the relocation of SPAK immunostaining in NKCC1 null mice suggests that targeting of SPAK to the membrane of choroid plexus epithelium requires the expression of NKCC1. This dependence of SPAK localization on NKCC1 strongly confirms the physiological significance of the data obtained with yeast two-hybrid, GST pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The activity of cation chloride cotransporters is affected during the cellular response to stress stimuli. The identity of the proteins involved in this process is unknown. In the present study we identified two stress-related Ste20 group kinases, SPAK and OSR1, as direct interactors of the cation chloride cotransporters. Both kinases interact with the amino terminus of NKCC1, NKCC2, and KCC3a and -b, but not of KCC1 and KCC4, thus exhibiting a remarkable overlap of specificity.

The irritating lachrymatory factor that is released by onions when they are chopped up has been presumed to be produced spontaneously following the action of the enzyme alliinase, which operates in the biochemical pathway that produces the compounds responsible for the onion's characteristic flavour1,2,3,4. Here we show that this factor is not formed as a by-product of this reaction, but that it is specifically synthesized by a previously undiscovered enzyme, lachrymatory-factor synthase. It may be possible to develop a non-lachrymatory onion that still retains its characteristic flavour and high nutritional value by downregulating the activity of this synthase enzyme."

Such reactive lipids covalently modify cellular target proteins, thereby affecting biological structure and function. Herein we report the identification of the epithelial fatty acid-binding protein (E-FABP) as a molecular target for 4-HNE modification both in vitro and in vivo. 4-HNE covalently modified (t 12 < 60 s) E-FABPin vitro, as revealed by a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and immunochemical reactivity using antibodies directed to 4-HNE-protein conjugates. Identification of Cys-120 as the major site of modification was determined through tandem mass spectral sequencing of tryptic peptides, as well as analysis of E-FABP mutants C120A, C127A, and C120A/C127A. The in vitro modification of Cys-120 by 4-HNE was relatively insensitive to pH (6.4–8.4), and temperature (4–37 °C) but was markedly potentiated by noncovalently bound fatty acids. 4-HNE-modified E-FABP was more stable than unmodified E-FABP to chemical denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride, as assessed by changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Analysis of soluble protein extracts from rat retina with antibodies directed to 4-HNE-protein conjugates revealed immunoreactivity with a 15-kDa protein that was identified by electrospray ionization and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry as E-FABP. Evaluation of retinal pigment epithelial cell extracts derived from E-FABP null mice by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using anti-4-HNE antibodies revealed increased modification in the null cells relative to those from wild type cells. These results indicate that E-FABP is a molecular target for 4-HNE modification and the hypothesis that E-FABP functions as an antioxidant protein by scavenging reactive lipids through covalent modification of Cys-120. 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) is a cytotoxic α,β-unsaturated acyl aldehyde that is naturally produced from lipid peroxidation and cleavage in response to oxidative stress and aging.

Because of their high affinity for hydrophobic molecules, they play a variety of roles in intracellular fatty acid, retinoid, bile acid, and sterol trafficking (2Coe N.R. Bernlohr D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1391: 287-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 3McArthur M.J. Atshaves B.P. Frolov A. Foxworth W.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1371-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each protein encoded by an LBP gene folds into a conserved structure consisting of 10 anti-parallel β strands that form a large interior water-filled cavity that serves as the hydrophobic ligand-binding site. Despite a wide variance in amino acid identity between family members (20–70%), x-ray crystallographic and high field NMR data demonstrate that all LBP forms exhibit the same β-barrel fold and that their α-carbon backbones are virtually superimposable (4Hertzel A.V. Bernlohr D.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 175-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 5Banaszak L. Winter N., Xu, Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S. Jones T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The epithelial fatty acid-binding protein (E-FABP) is unique among the LBPs because of the presence of six cysteine residues, two of which, Cys-120 and Cys-127, are modeled to form a disulfide bond within the ligand binding cavity (6Gutierrez-Gonzalez L.H.

Spener F. van Tilbeurgh H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12229-12239Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Importantly, the side chains of Cys-120 and Cys-127 lie within 4.5 Å of the C2–C4 methylene region of a bound fatty acid (8Kane C.D. Coe N.R. Vanlandingham B. Krieg P. Bernlohr D.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2894-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The regulation of epithelial FABP gene expression is unique, for it is up-regulated in a variety of cell types in response to experimental challenges linked to oxidative stress and the generation of reactive oxygen species. These include chemical, molecular (9Ostergaard M. Rasmussen H.H. Nielsen H.V. Vorum H. Orntoft T.F. Wolf H. Celis J.E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4111-4117PubMed Google Scholar), or viral transformation; disease states associated with inflammation (psoriasis) (10Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Leffers H. Honore B. Celis J.E. J.

Reactive oxygen species can be produced exogenously or from a variety of intracellular processes collectively linked to the generation of superoxide anions, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide (15Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7425) Google Scholar). Such reactive oxidants chemically modify a variety of biological molecules, including polyunsaturated acyl chains of membrane phospholipids generating a family of lipid hydroperoxides. In addition, enzymatic oxidation of membrane phospholipids through the lipoxygenase enzyme systems also generates bioactive lipid hydroperoxides. The combination of chemical and enzymatic lipid hydroperoxide-generating systems provide substrates for the Hock cleavage, thereby generating a variety of α,β-unsaturated acyl aldehydes, the most well studied being 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) (16Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar, 17Van Kuijk F.J. Holte L.L. Dratz E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). 4-HNE is a relatively stable, long-lived, diffusible lipid that is generally considered to be cytotoxic because of its ability to covalently modify a variety of biomolecules via Michael addition reactions across the double bond and Schiff base formation at the carbonyl (18Esterbauer H. Zollner H. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1989; 7: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 19Poli G. Schaur R.J. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). 4-HNE-modified DNA is associated with defects in replication (20Hauptlorenz S. Esterbauer H. Moll W. Pumpel R.

On proteins, 4-HNE reacts with a variety of amino acid side chains through amine and/or sulfhydryl modification, often affecting the biological structure and activity of target proteins (17Van Kuijk F.J. Holte L.L. Dratz E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Esterbauer H. Zollner H. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1989; 7: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Because reactive oxygen species are linked to oxidative stress and aging (25Sohal R.S. Weindruch R. Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2640) Google Scholar, 26Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 547-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3156) Google Scholar, 27Stadtman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar), the identification of cellular targets for 4-HNE modification has been a subject of intense investigation. Moreover, analysis of cellular mechanisms linked to the antioxidant response may provide mechanistic clues as to the regulation of macromolecule turnover. Given the lipid binding properties of E-FABP, its up-regulation in response to conditions linked to oxidative stress, and structural positioning of redox-sensitive thiols within the binding cavity near the bound lipid, we have pursued the hypothesis that the protein is an endogenous target for 4-HNE modification. Herein we report that cysteine 120 is covalently modified by 4-HNE in vitro as well as the properties of such modification. Moreover, the protein is modified with 4-HNE in vivo and retinal epithelial cell lines derived from E-FABP null mice exhibit an up-regulation of 4-HNE-modified proteins. These results indicate that E-FABP is a molecular target for 4-HNE modification and the hypothesis that the protein serves as an antioxidant by scavenging reactive lipids from the cellular environment. 4-HNE was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Polyclonal antibody against 4-HNE- protein adducts was obtained from Alpha Diagnostics (San Antonio, TX). 1-Anilinonapthalene-8-sulfonate was purchased from Biomol, Inc. Modified sequence grade trypsin was obtained from Promega. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and dihydroxybenzoic acid in methanol were purchased from Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA). Bio-Spin columns loaded with Bio-Gel P-6 were obtained from Bio-Rad. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were purchased from AmershamBiosciences. Bacterially expressed E-FABP was purified to homogeneity as previously described (28Simpson M.A. Bernlohr D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10980-10986Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) through a combination of acid fractionation and gel filtration chromatography. Homogeneous protein eluting from the Sephadex G-75 column was concentrated and dialyzed extensively against the standard buffer, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4). The protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic assay (Pierce). Using the standard purification protocol, the pH 5.0 acidification step facilitates endogenous fatty acid release and the subsequent gel filtration separates any lipid from protein. To evaluate preparations of E-FABP for the presence of fatty acids, the protein sample was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) after the addition of C15:0 as an internal standard. Extracted fatty acids were converted to methyl esters using 14% boron trifluoride in methanol and subjected to gas chromatography analysis using a HP 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and integrator. Native E-FABP purified with less than 0.05 mol of FA/mol of protein. As such, the standard purification yields protein essentially devoid of bound fatty acids and is considered apoprotein. To prepare mutants of E-FABP with various cysteine to alanine substitutions, the murine E-FABP cDNA was PCR-amplified as aBamHI/EcoRI fragment and cloned into the pRSET plasmid resulting in the expression vector pRSET-His6-E-FABP. After induction of expression inE. coli, a recombinant protein with an amino terminus containing a six-histidine tract, a flexible linker region, and a protease cleavage site amino to the E-FABP coding region is produced. The resulting protein has an amino terminus of MRGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGNNMGRDLYDDDDKSRWGSM, where the first methionine listed is the initiating residue and the last methionine listed initiates the E-FABP coding region. To generate the C120A, C127A, and C120A/C127A mutants of E-FABP, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed (29Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) within the pRSET-His6-E-FABP backbone. All expressed constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The cDNA constructs expressing the His6-tagged proteins were transformed into BL21(DE3) pLysS cells, and expression was induced by the addition of 0.01 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the growth medium for 3 h. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold standard buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture of aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin, sonicated, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g to generate a soluble protein extract. The soluble protein extract containing various E-FABP forms was used for 4-HNE modification reactions. Because the cysteine to alanine mutations have no effect on fatty acid binding activity, wild type and E-FABP mutants associate with a variety of endogenous E. coli fatty acids, the most prevalent being palmitic and oleic acid. On average, recombinant FABPs expressed in bacteria have between 0.4 and 0.6 mol of FA/mol of protein. As such, protein used in crude extracts or purified without acidification is considered largely holoprotein. Purified E-FABP (10 μm) in 10 mm potassium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) (standard buffer) was incubated with 4-HNE at 22 °C for various times. Aliquots were removed and immediately applied to a P-6 Bio-Spin column and centrifuged for 4 min to separate modified protein eluting in the void volume from any free unreacted 4-HNE remaining on the column. Protein eluting from the Bio-Spin column was analyzed by a combination of MALDI-TOF MS and electrospray MS including tandem mass spectrometry, or by immunochemical methods. To evaluate the influence of noncovalently bound fatty acids on 4-HNE modification, E-FABP (10 μm) was incubated with oleic acid (10- and 25-fold molar ratio to E-FABP) and equilibrated for 2 min to saturate the protein (30Jenkins A.E. Hockenberry J.A. Nguyen T. Bernlohr D.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2022-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) prior to addition of 4-HNE, and then treated identically. For immunochemical detection of 4-HNE bound to protein, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane was blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody directed toward 4-HNE protein adducts (1:1000 dilution) at 4 °C for 16 h. The membranes were then washed in the same buffer and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:25,000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. The immunoreactivity was detected with enhanced chemiluminescence according to the instructions from the manufacturer (31Isacsson A. Watermark G. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1974; 68: 339-362Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For some experiments, goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3000 dilution) was used in conjunction with the substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium to visualize the immunoreaction. Guanidine hydrochloride-induced protein unfolding was performed as previously described (28Simpson M.A. Bernlohr D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10980-10986Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, E-FABP (0.5 μm) in a potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was mixed with increasing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride from 0 to 3m and the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measured using a Spex Fluoromax II fluorometer. Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 285 nm, and denaturation was monitored by the red-shifting of the fluorescence emission maximum from 336 to 356 nm. 4-HNE-modified protein prepared as described from the P-6 column was dialyzed into 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8) containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 10 mm EDTA at 4 °C to denature the protein. The protein was incubated with 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) for 1 h at 56 °C and subsequently cooled to room temperature. To modify the reduced thiol groups, iodoacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 20 mm and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in the dark. For rat retinal proteins, iodoacetamide was used for cysteine alkylations. The protein was then dialyzed exhaustively against 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0). After dialysis, 0.8 nmol of protein was digested with 0.016 nmol of trypsin in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 16 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of glacial acetic acid and samples stored at −80 °C prior to mass spectral analysis. For some analyses, 4-HNE-modified E-FABP was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver-stained to identify the samples of interest. The stained protein bands were excised and processed for trypsin in-gel digestion as described (32Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Prior to protease digestion, the cysteine residues were reduced and alkylated using iodoacetic acid. Peptides were extracted by sequential extraction with 50% ammonium bicarbonate buffer and 45% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid. The peptides were then evaporated to near dryness and stored at −80 °C prior to mass spectral analysis. Prior to MALDI-TOF MS analysis, a portion of the peptide mixture was desalted using Millipore C18 ZipTips using the protocol of the manufacturer. Full scans from 500 to 3500m/z of the tryptic peptide mixtures and intact protein data from 4000 to 22,000 m/z were collected on a Brüker Biflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a N2 laser (337 nm, 3-ns pulse length) and a microchannel plate detector. The peptide data were collected in the reflectron mode, positive polarity, with an accelerating potential of 19 kV using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid diluted 1:1 (v/v) with acetonitrile:nanopure water (50:50), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Whole protein mass spectra were collected in linear mode using sinapinic acid (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) as the matrix with an accelerating potential of 19 kV. Each spectrum was the accumulation of ∼200 laser shots. External calibration for peptide analysis was performed using human angiotensin II (monoisotopic [MH+] 1046.5 m/z; Sigma) and adrenocorticotropin hormone fragment 18–39 (monoisotopic [MH+] 2465.2m/z; Sigma); external calibration for intact protein analysis was performed with myoglobin (average [MH+] 16,952 m/z) and cytochromec (average [MH+] 12,361m/z). Full scan and tandem mass spectral data of select ions of the peptide mixture were collected on a QSTAR Pulsar quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) with a MALDI source using dihydroxybenzoic acid as the matrix. The TOF region acceleration voltage was 4 kV, and the injection pulse repetition rate was 6.0 kHz. Laser pulses were generated with a nitrogen laser at 337 nm, 33 microjoules of laser energy using a laser repetition rate of 20 Hz. Mass spectra were the average of ∼50 laser shots collected in positive mode from 500 to 3500 m/z. External calibration was performed with the same standards used on the Biflex, described above. The tryptic peptides in a portion of the sample were separated on a 75-μm internal diameter C18 capillary column with a ThermoFinnigan (San Jose, CA) LCQ Classic ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoelectrospray source from New Objective (33Singh S.K.

Tandem MS data were searched against a subset protein data base containing Mus mus entries using SequestTM, the ThermoFinnigan peptide MS/MS data interpretation software (34Eng J. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5472) Google Scholar). The variable modification HNE (δ mass 156 if a Michael addition occurs on a cysteine, histidine or lysine residue and 138 if a Schiff base reaction occurs on lysine residue (19Poli G. Schaur R.J. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) was entered into the appropriate Sequest parameter field. An aliquot of the tryptic peptides was desalted using Poros R2 (ABI, Foster City, CA) in a glass purification capillary (Protana, Odense, Denmark). Briefly, the peptide mixture was loaded onto the R2, washed three times with 7 μl of H2O:acetonitrile (95:5) and 0.5% formic acid, and eluted with 1.5 μl of H2O:acetonitrile (30:70) and 0.5% formic acid into a coated nanoelectrospray capillary (Protana). Tandem mass spectra were collected in an information-dependent acquisition scan mode during nanospray infusion of peptides at ∼5 nl/min flow rate with a spray voltage of 1000 V and TOF parameters as described above. Tandem mass spectra were searched using BioAnalyst (ABI) and Mascot (www.matrixscience.com). Experiments were performed on retinas obtained from 10-month-old Fischer 344 Brown Norway F1 hybrid male rats. Retinal isolates were prepared by homogenizing the retinas from two rats in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (20% sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm Tris-acetate (pH 7.2), and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) and centrifuged for 15 min at 100 × g. The supernatant was collected and the pellet re-homogenized in an additional 1 ml of homogenization buffer. The supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 600 × g for 15 min. The supernatant containing soluble retina proteins was retained, and aliquots were stored at −80 °C. To prepare retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell lines, wild type C57Bl/6J mice or animals harboring a targeted disruption of the FABP5 gene encoding E-FABP were anesthetized with 5 mg of ketamine and 1 mg of xylazine per mouse and sacrificed with a lethal injection of Euthasol (200 μl). Epithelial cells from the retina were harvested and cultured as described (35Mayerson P.L. Hall M.O. Clark V. Abrams T. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1985; 26: 1599-1609PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the eyes were enucleated and washed two times with Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (CMF-PBS) and placed in a digest solution containing 105 units/ml collagenase and 50 units/ml hyaluronidase in CMF-PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. The globes were washed two times with CMF-PBS and digested a second time with 0.05% (w/v) trypsin containing 0.5 mmEDTA for 15 min at 37 °C. Trypsin was inactivated by washing the globes with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Using a dissecting microscope, the cornea and lens were aseptically excised from the eyes and the retina with the layer of RPE cells still attached was gently lifted away from the choroid. The connection between the retina and RPE was disrupted by incubating the tissue at 37 °C in trypsin/EDTA until the RPE cells dissociated from the retina. After removing the retina, the remaining supernatant containing RPE cells was washed two times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated as described above with the additions of 0.05% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and 50 ng/ml mouse epidermal growth factor at 37 °C. The RPE cells were immortalized ∼5 days after harvest with the papilloma virus E6a and E7 genes via a retroviral vector produced in PA317 packaging cells. To separate rat retinal or murine RPE proteins, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis consisting of first dimension isoelectric focusing and second dimension SDS-PAGE was utilized. 100 μg of soluble protein was organically precipitated according to the method of Wessel and Flügge (36Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar), dried under nitrogen, and rehydrated into an immobilized pH gradient strip (pH 3–11) using 250 μl of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2% Triton X-100, 8 m urea, and 10 mm DTT for 14 h. Following hydration, samples were focused at 250 V for 15 min, at which time the voltage was linearly increased to 8000 V over 2.5 h and held to reach a total of 35,000 V·h. For the second dimension, the focused strips were equilibrated for 10 min in 6 m urea, 2% SDS, 375 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 20% glycerol, 100 mm DTT; rinsed; and incubated for 10 min in 6 murea, 2% SDS, 375 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 20% glycerol, 135 mm iodoacetamide. The equilibrated strips were embedded in 0.5% (w/v) agarose on the top of 10% acrylamide gel, and second dimension SDS-PAGE was performed (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins in gels were either stained (32Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar) or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunochemical analysis. High resolution NMR structures of E-FABP with a bound fatty acid have revealed that the C2–C4 methylene region of the acyl chain is adjacent to the Cys-120-Cys-127 disulfide bond (8Kane C.D. Coe N.R. Vanlandingham B. Krieg P. Bernlohr D.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2894-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, E-FABP is up-regulated in response to a variety of stimuli correlated with oxidative damage. Because oxidative damage is often mechanistically linked to the generation of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation with subsequent production of reactive α,β-unsaturated medium chain acyl aldehydes, we hypothesized that E-FABP may bind such lipids, even though their chain length is generally considered too short to be bound by FABPs. Moreover, given the proximity of the Cys-120–Cys-127 disulfide to the putative position of the bound unsaturated aldehyde, we conjectured that, if such binding were to occur, a Michael addition reaction may proceed producing a covalent protein-lipid conjugate. To that end, we carried out preliminary experiments by incubating 4-HNE, as a model α,β-unsaturated acyl aldehyde, and homogeneous E-FABP and analyzed the product following separation using P-6 Bio-Spin column chromatography by MALDI-TOF MS. The calculated molecular mass of murine E-FABP lacking the initiating methionine is 15,006 Da. Fig. 1 shows that three major mass forms of E-FABP were detected. An ion atm/z of 15,001 ± 5 corresponds to the native protein, and an ion observed at m/z of 15,155 ± 5 is consistent with the calculated mass for E-FABP plus one 4-HNE molecule covalently bound. The third ion with am/z of 15,206 ± 5 represents a sinapinic acid adduct of E-FABP normally seen with high resolution mass spectrometry. The indicated errors in m/z value reflect the expected mass accuracy of the Biflex MALDI-TOF MS. Control experiments carried out by incubating E-FABP with long chain fatty acids (oleic acid) did not gener"
https://openalex.org/W2041362443,"Hec1 (highly expressed incancer) plays essential roles in chromosome segregation by interacting through its coiled-coil domains with several proteins that modulate the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase. Hec1 localizes to kinetochores, and its inactivation either by genetic deletion or antibody neutralization leads to severe and lethal chromosomal segregation errors, indicating that Hec1 plays a critical role in chromosome segregation. The mechanisms by which Hec1 is regulated, however, are not known. Here we show that human Hec1 is a serine phosphoprotein and that it binds specifically to the mitotic regulatory kinase Nek2 during G<sub>2</sub>/M. Nek2 phosphorylates Hec1 on serine residue 165, both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Yeast cells are viable without scNek2/Kin3, a close structural homolog of Nek2 that binds to both human and yeast Hec1. When the same yeasts carry an scNek2/Kin3 (D55G) or Nek2 (E38G) mutation to mimic a similar temperature-sensitive <i>nima</i> mutation in<i>Aspergillus</i>, their growth is arrested at the nonpermissive temperature, because the scNek2/Kin3 (D55G) mutant binds to Hec1 but fails to phosphorylate it. Whereas wild-type human Hec1 rescues lethality resulting from deletion of Hec1 in <i>Saccharomyces cerevesiae</i>, a human Hec1 mutant or yeast Hec1 mutant changing Ser<sup>165</sup> to Ala or yeast Hec1 mutant changing Ser<sup>201</sup> to Ala does not. Mutations changing the same Ser residues to Glu, to mimic the negative charge created by phosphorylation, partially rescue lethality but result in a high incidence of errors in chromosomal segregation. These results suggest that cell cycle-regulated serine phosphorylation of Hec1 by Nek2 is essential for faithful chromosome segregation."

Each of the four Notch genes is expressed in distinct spatiotemporal patterns and has been shown to play independent and overlapping roles in the mammalian systems (15Swiatek P.J.

Recently, we and others have identified mammalian Mam and have shown that both the mammalian andDrosophila Mam proteins stabilize and participate in the DNA-binding complex of the intracellular domains of Notch (NotchIC) and CSL proteins during the activation of the target promoters (25Kitagawa M.

These proteins have properties similar to the previously characterized human Mam. They exhibited stabilization and participation to the NotchIC/CSL DNA-binding complex and enhancement of the activation of transcription from the target promoter. However, we also show evidence that some members of the Notch receptors have a preference for the three human Mam proteins as a partner to activate the target. Thus, the multiplicity of Mam proteins may help provide divergence to the strength of the Notch signals in various cell types. Deletion mutants of hMam-2 and hMam-3 were constructed by digestions with appropriate restriction endonucleases, blunt ending by T4 DNA polymerase or S1 nuclease, and ligation. The 3′ end of the coding region of hMam-2 (1–1133) was fused to the coding region of green fluorescence protein (GFP) with double point mutations (GFP (F64L,S65T)) from pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) to give hMam-2-GFP. The 3′ end of the coding region of hMam-3 (1–1150) was fused to the sequence of GFP with single point mutation from pGreenLantern (Invitrogen) or Myc epitope from pCMV-Tag5 (Stratagene) to give hMam-3-GFP or hMam-3-Myc, respectively. The various hMam-2 and hMam-3 cDNAs were cloned into pEF-BOS (33Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) for expression in mammalian cells. Expression vectors for the intracellular domain of human Notch1 (hNotch1IC; pcDNA1/Amp-hNotch1IC) and RBP-J (pEF-RBP-J) were as described (25Kitagawa M. Oyama T. Kawashima T. Yedvobnick B. Kumar A.

Expression vectors for murine Notch1IC (residues Arg1747–Lys2531) and Notch4IC (residues Gln1465–Asn1964) (pEF-BOSneo-mNotch1 RAMIC and pEF-BOSneo-mNotch4 RAMIC) were as described (20Mizutani T.

Multiple tissue Northern blot and multiple tissue Northern blot II (Clontech) membranes that had been immobilized with polyadenylated RNAs from various human tissues were hybridized with 32P-labeled fragments from hMam-1 (2.4 kb; XhoI-XhoI) (25Kitagawa M.

Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing were done in stringent conditions under standard procedures. The washed membranes were analyzed with BAS2000 image analyzer (Fuji, Japan) without modification. After the analysis, the membranes were stripped out of the radioactivity, hybridized again with human β-actin probe (Clontech), and analyzed as above. All of the experiments for the three probes were performed concomitantly. pGEX-hMam-1 (amino acids 1–344) was constructed by introducing the coding sequence of hMam-1 into pGEX-4T (Pharmacia Corp.). Glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was expressed in the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli. The rabbits were immunized by the purified protein with a standard procedure to raise antisera against hMam-1 protein. Immunoglobulin was purified with protein G column. Two of the antibody preparations (2-4 and 3-1) cross-reacted with hMam-2 protein. 293T cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum were transfected with plasmids by the calcium phosphate method. Two days after the transfection, the protein was extracted from the cells with 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9) buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 15% glycerol, 300 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and proteinase inhibitors (25Kitagawa M.

The whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Notch1 (Santa Cruz; sc-6014) or an anti-Posh (Santa Cruz; sc-8280) and protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Corp.). After separation by SDS-PAGE, the proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies used for blotting were anti-hMam-1 (2–4 and 3–1), anti-c-Myc (9E10), anti-Notch1 (sc-6014), anti-RBP-J (T6719) (35Sakai T. Furukawa T. Iwanari H. Oka C. Nakano T. Kawaichi M.

They were visualized with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, SuperSignal (Pierce), or Lumi-Light Plus (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) chemiluminescent substrate, and x-ray films. In some cases, the membranes were stripped and reblotted. EMSA using transfected 293T cells were detailed in Ref. 25Kitagawa M. Oyama T. Kawashima T. Yedvobnick B. Kumar A. Matsuno K. Harigaya K.

Briefly, cells (2 × 106 cells/10-cm dish) were transfected with 5 μg each of the expression vectors for RBP-J, NotchIC, and Mam constructs or their empty counterparts. Total amount of the plasmid DNA was kept constant (15 μg). DNA-protein binding reactions were done by incubation of the whole cell extracts (20 μg, equivalent to the protein amount) in a solution (15 μl) containing 13 mmHepes-NaOH (pH 7.9) buffer supplemented with 8% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 66.6 μg/ml poly(dI-dC):poly(dI-dC), and 33.3 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 15 min on ice, followed by an additional 30-min incubation with 32P end-labeled synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (0.1–0.2 ng in 1 μl, 5–20 nCi) at room temperature. The final concentration of the probe is 0.25–0.5 fmol/μl. Half of the mixture was loaded on polyacrylamide gels (5%) in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer to separate the DNA-protein complexes. The complexes were detected by exposing the dried gels to x-ray films. For competition analysis to define sequence specificity of DNA-binding complexes, the molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides was included in the binding reaction. The sequences of the oligonucleotides for the labeled probe were from the murineHES-1 gene that include the RBP-J-binding site (−91 to −56; HES-1 probe) (25Kitagawa M. Oyama T. Kawashima T.

For assay with the four murine NotchICs, the cells were cotransfected with 0.3 μg of pHES-5luc reporter plasmid, 0.3 μg of pEF-BOSneo with or without NotchIC cDNAs, 1 ng of pRL-CMV, and 0.4 μg of mixtures of pEF-BOS and the expression vectors for the three Mams in various ratio. The transient transfection was done using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, firefly andRenilla luciferase activities were determined using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a Turner Designs TD20/20 dual luminometer. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized with theRenilla luciferase control activities. 293T cells were seeded on the Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge NUNC, Naperville, IL). The cells were transfected with plasmids by calcium phosphate method. Two days after the transfection, the cells were analyzed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 410, Carl Zeiss). During a project to clone long human cDNAs, we have come across two cDNA sequences (KIAA1816 and KIAA1819) (38Nagase T. Nakayama M. Nakajima D. Kikuno R. Ohara O. DNA Res. 2001; 8: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) that potentially encode proteins with similarity to hMam-1 (Fig. 1 A). The overall identity between hMam-1 protein and each of the proteins encoded by these cDNAs is 30 and 20%, respectively (TableI). The arrangements of basic and acidic amino acid clusters in the Mam proteins including DrosophilaMam are well conserved, implying that their higher order structures are related (Fig. 1 B). Based on the results reported below, we have tentatively named the protein encoded by KIAA1816 hMam-2 and that encoded by KIAA1819 hMam-3.Figure 1Primary structure of Mam proteins.

Sequences analyzed were Drosophila Mam (DMam; GenBank™ accession number X54251), hMam-1 (D83785), hMam-2 (AB058719), and hMam-3 (AB058722). The expression of hMam-2 and hMam-3 mRNA in various human tissues was examined by Northern blotting analysis. For reference, hMam-1 mRNA was also analyzed in the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 2,hMam-2 mRNA exists as a single 7.9-kb transcript, andhMam-3 mRNA exists as a single 7.5-kb species. ForhMam-3 mRNA, an additional 5.6-kb species was found inperipheral blood leukocytes and in placenta. Fig. 2 also shows that all three Mam mRNAs are expressed in many tissues with distinct patterns. Furthermore, it also indicates that multiple Mam mRNA species are expressed in a number of tissues. We cloned each of the open reading frames of hMam-2 andhMam-3 cDNAs into a mammalian expression vector. When we blotted extracts of 293T cells transfected with these vectors, we found one of antisera raised against the N-terminal portion of hMam-1 protein cross-reacts with hMam-2. As shown in Fig. 3 A, in addition to hMam-1 protein, which has an apparent molecular mass of 140 kDa, a single protein with an apparent molecular mass of 169 kDa was detected in the extract from the cells transfected with hMam-2. In contrast to hMam-2 protein, none of the anti-hMam-1 antisera reacted to hMam-3 protein (Fig. 3 A). Thus, we attached a Myc tag to the C terminus of its coding region to identify the product ofhMam-3 cDNA. Using an anti-Myc antibody, a single protein with an apparent molecular mass of 186 kDa was detected by Western blotting analysis of 293T cells transfected with this vector (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Functional association of human Mam proteins with an intracellular domain of Notch and a CSL protein.

Maruyama S. Kawaichi M. Honjo T. Cell. 1992; 69: 1191-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Using EMSA, we analyzed binding activities in the extracts of the cells to a sequence from the HES-1 promoter, which has been shown to be essential for activation by the Notch1IC domain (22Jarriault S.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 C (lane 2), an extract from the cells transfected with RBP-J exhibited two specific bands that had been shown to contain RBP-J (25Kitagawa M. Oyama T. Kawashima T. Yedvobnick B. Kumar A. Matsuno K. Harigaya K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of hNotch1IC with RBP-J induced another RBP-J/hNotch1IC complex that migrates more slowly than the bands mentioned above (Fig. 3 C, lane 3) (25Kitagawa M. Oyama T. Kawashima T. Yedvobnick B. Kumar A. Matsuno K. Harigaya K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Coexpression of hMam-1 with these two proteins reduced the RBP-J-specific bands and induced RBP-J/hNotch1IC/hMam-1 bands that migrate more slowly (Fig. 3 C, lane 4) (25Kitagawa M. Oyama T. Kawashima T. Yedvobnick B. Kumar A. Matsuno K. Harigaya K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Expression of hMam-2 with RBP-J and hNotch1IC results in activities similar to that of RBP-J/hNotch1IC/hMam-1 transfection (Fig. 3 C, lane 5). Furthermore, as was the case for hMam-1 (25Kitagawa M. Oyama T. Kawashima T. Yedvobnick B. Kumar A. Matsuno K. Harigaya K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), expression of hMam-2 without hNotch1IC does not significantly alter the DNA binding activity of RBP-J or endogenous RBP-J-like factor (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1,2, 6, and 7). Fig. 3 D shows the analysis with the hMam-3 vector. Expression of hMam-3 with RBP-J and hNotch1IC again results in similar binding activities to the RBP-J/hNotch1IC/hMam-1 and RBP-J/hNotch1IC/hMam-2 transfection (Fig. 3 D, lanes 4–6). Expression of hMam-3 without hNotch1IC also does not significantly alter the DNA binding activity of RBP-J or endogenous RBP-J-like factor (Fig. 3 D, lanes 1,2, 7, and 10). To verify the DNA binding specificities of these complexes, we examined the effects of unlabeled competitors on the DNA binding reaction. As shown in Fig. 3 E, the fast migrating complex in the vector-transfected extract and the two specific complexes in the RBP-J-transfected extracts were competed by molar excess of the unlabeled HES-1 probe but not by the same molar excess of a double-stranded oligonucleotide with unrelated sequence. Furthermore, all of the slowly migrating complexes in the RBP-J/hNotch1IC, RBP-J/hNotch1IC/hMam-1, RBP-J/hNotch1IC/hMam-2, and RBP-J/hNotch1IC/hMam-3-transfected extracts were competed out by molar excess of the unlabeled HES-1 probe but not by the unrelated oligonucleotide (Fig. 3, F and G). These results indicate that RBP-J complex and all of the apparent multimeric complexes bind to the RBP-J site in the HES-1 promoter in a sequence-specific manner. We next analyzed the complex formation by coimmunoprecipitation. This assay revealed that both hMam-2 and hMam-3 are, like hMam-1, specifically coprecipitated with hNotch1IC and RBP-J by an anti-Notch1 antibody but not by an anti-Posh antibody, which has been raised against the C-terminal portion of Posh (a downstream signaling molecule for Rac GTPase) protein (40Tapon N.

https://openalex.org/W2006398084,"A novel conotoxin, α-conotoxin ImII (α-CTx ImII), identified from Conus imperialis venom ducts, was chemically synthesized. A previously characterized C. imperialis conotoxin, α-conotoxin ImI (α-CTx ImI), is closely related; 9 of 12 amino acids are identical. Both α-CTx ImII and α-CTx ImI functionally inhibit heterologously expressed rat α7 nAChRs with similar IC50 values. Furthermore, the biological activities of intracranially applied α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII are similar over the same dosage range, and are consistent with α7 nAChR inhibition. However, unlike α-CTx ImI, α-CTx ImII was not able to block the binding of α-bungarotoxin to α7 nAChRs. α-Conotoxin ImI and α-bungarotoxin-binding sites have been well characterized as overlapping and located at the cleft between adjacent nAChR subunits. Because α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII share extensive sequence homology, the inability of α-CTx ImII to compete with α-BgTx is surprising. Furthermore, functional studies in oocytes indicate that there is no overlap between functional binding sites of α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII. Like α-CTx ImI, the block by α-CTx ImII is voltage-independent. Thus, α-CTx ImII represents a probe for a novel antagonist binding site, or microsite, on the α7 nAChR.

Many of these peptides, the conotoxins, are rich in cysteine residues and are highly disulfide-bonded. Known conotoxins may be divided into families based on shared features (reviewed in Refs. 1McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar and 2McIntosh J.M. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 605-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Members of a given conotoxin family have a characteristic number and spacing of cysteines, a conserved disulfide connectivity, and similar receptor targets. However, the toxins in a given family show great variability in their intercysteine sequence, and this accounts for the high degree of receptor subtype specificity within a toxin family. For example, the α-conotoxins are inhibitors of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs),1 but individual α-conotoxins show a high degree of selectivity for different nAChR subtypes including the neuromuscular subtype and various neuronal subtypes (1McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Minor changes in the sequence of the non-Cys residues of conotoxins can profoundly change their receptor subtype specificity. For example, the conotoxin α-CTx PnIA preferentially targets the α7 nAChR and α-CTx PnIB preferentially targets the α3β2 nAChR despite the fact that the toxins only vary in two of 16 amino acids (3Luo S. Nguyen T.A. Cartier G.E. Olivera B.M. Yoshikami D. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14542-14548Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the discovery of a novel α-conotoxin, α-conotoxin ImII (α-CTx ImII) from the worm-hunting snail,Conus imperialis. This molecule is very similar to the previously characterized C. imperialis toxin α-conotoxin ImI (α-CTx ImI) (it is identical in 9 of 12 amino acids). Like α-CTx ImI, α-CTx ImII inhibits the α7 nAChR, and both toxins display very similar potencies against this receptor. Unlike α-CTx ImI, however, α-CTx ImII does not compete with α-bungarotoxin (α-BgTx), a classical competitive inhibitor of the α7 nAChR. Additionally, we show that α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII share little, if any, overlap in their functional binding sites on the receptor. The discovery of α-CTx ImII thus illustrates that not only can small changes in intercysteine amino acids alter subtype specificity, but they can also result in toxins that target the same receptor subtype at different sites. Puregene reagents were purchased from Gentra (Minneapolis, MN); PCR and molecular biology reagents were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA); salts, acetylcholine, and α-BgTx were from Sigma; 3-125I-α-BgTx (>200 Ci/mmol) was fromAmersham Biosciences; rat brains minus cerebellum were from Zivic Miller (Zelionople, PA); HEK293 cells, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media, and fetal bovine serum were from ATCC (Manasses, VA); and all other cell culture reagents were from Sigma.

The plasmid for generation of rat α7 nAChR RNA was a gift from Dr. J. Boulter. The sequence of α-CTx ImII was obtained as part of a systematic analysis of α-conotoxin sequences, using PCR amplification of both cDNA and genomic DNA (5Colledge C.J. Hunsperger J.P. Imperial J.S.

The cDNA was prepared from venom duct as described previously (8Shon K. Olivera B.M. Watkins M. Jacobsen R.B. Gray W.R. Floresca C.Z. Cruz L.J. Hillyard D.R. Bring A. Terlau H. Yoshikami D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and genomic DNA was extracted from hepatopancreas using Puregene reagents and the marine invertebrates protocol provided by the manufacturer (Gentra). Linear α-CTx ImI was synthesized and oxidized to form disulfide bridges (folded) as described previously (9McIntosh J.M. Yoshikami D. Mahe E. Nielsen D.B. Rivier J.E. Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16733-16739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Linear α-CTx ImII was synthesized by standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, using an ABI model 430A peptide synthesizer at the University of Utah core facility. The peptide was folded to give the correct disulfide connectivity (first Cys to third Cys and second Cys to fourth Cys) using orthogonal Cys protection. The first and third Cys residues had stable Cys(S-acetomidomethyl) protection, whereas the second and fourth Cys residues had acid-labile Cys(S-trityl) protection. A previously described folding scheme (3Luo S. Nguyen T.A. Cartier G.E. Olivera B.M. Yoshikami D. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14542-14548Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) that sequentially closed the second Cys to fourth Cys bridge and then the first Cys to third Cys bridge was used to generate toxin. The analogs [P6R]α-CTx ImI and [R6P]α-CTx ImII were generated in the same way as α-CTx ImII. Biological activity of synthetic α-conotoxins was tested by intracranial injection into young mice as described previously (10Clark C. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Toxicon. 1981; 19: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Complementary RNA encoding rat α7 nAChR was prepared and injected into Xenopus laevisoocytes as described previously (11Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7522-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The RNA was generated by in vitro transcription using a plasmid that was a gift from Dr. J. Boulter. The plasmid carries a rat α7 nAChR cDNA clone (accession number M85273) inserted into the EcoRI site of pBS SK(−). RNA was transcribed from the T7 promoter of SmaI linearized plasmid. Oocytes were injected 1–2 days after harvesting and used for voltage clamping 1–7 days after injection. Voltage clamping was done essentially as has been described elsewhere (11Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7522-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were clamped at a holding potential of −70 mV with a two-electrode system and were perfused in a 30-μl bath with ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.1–7.5). Currents were elicited with 1-s pulses of 200 μm ACh in ND96 every 1 min. Only oocytes that yielded stable responses to successive ACh pulses were used. To determine the concentration dependence of inhibition of rat α7 nAChRs, toxin was applied using a static bath method. That is, the ACh pulses and ND96 flow were halted, and conotoxin was applied to the bath. The bath was allowed to equilibrate for 5 min before the ND96 flow was resumed at the same time an the ACh pulse was applied. ACh pulses and ND96 flow continued until stable ACh-evoked currents were re-established. To determine the inhibition at different conotoxin concentrations, the peak current elicited by the first ACh pulse following toxin exposure was normalized to the peak current elicited following controls where ND96 alone, instead of toxin, were applied. To show that the 5-min exposure to toxin was sufficient for toxin/receptor binding to reach equilibrium, 5- and 10-min exposures of 1, 0.33, and 0.033 μm α-CTx ImI or 1, 0.33, and 0.1 μm α-CTx ImII were carried out, and no difference in percentage inhibition was seen at the two times. To investigate the voltage dependence of α-CTx ImII inhibition, the block caused by 1 μm α-CTx ImII was measured as described above, but at a range of holding potentials randomly altered between −110, −90, −70, −50, −30, and −10 mV. To determine the current-voltage relationship in the absence of toxin, the ratio of current amplitudes at two successive potentials was determined from the average of at least five currents before and after the voltage change. The plasmid pZeoSV2-α7(V201)/5-HT3 was a gift from Dr. N. S. Millar (4Cooper S.T. Millar N.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2585-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It encodes a chimeric receptor that has the N-terminal ACh-binding domain of the rat α7 nAChR and the C-terminal of the homologous 5-HT3 receptor. The chimera was expressed in HEK293 cells, which are null for endogenous α-BgTx binding. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Cells were transfected with pZeoSV2-α7(V201)/5-HT3 using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions for HEK293 cells. After 48 h the cells were washed with ice-cold potassium Ringer's (PR) solution (140 mm KCl, 5.4 mmNaCl, 1.7 mm MgCl2 , 25 mm HEPES, and 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, adjusted to a pH of 7.4 with 10 mm NaOH). The cells were detached into fresh, ice-cold PR (3 ml/10-cm cell culture plate) with a cell scraper and were spun down (10,000 × g). The cells were washed twice by resuspension in ice-cold PR followed by recentrifugation. The suspension was passed 10 times through an 18-gauge needle, divided into 1-ml aliquots, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C until use. Crude rat brain membranes were prepared as described previously (3Luo S. Nguyen T.A. Cartier G.E. Olivera B.M. Yoshikami D. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14542-14548Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) except that membranes were frozen and stored in PR. Each assay (300 μl total volume) consisted of the following in PR: 200 μl of thawed cells or crude rat brain membranes, a final concentration of 4 nm3-125I-α-BgTx (Amersham Biosciences) and various concentrations of α-CTx ImI, α-CTx ImII, or 100 μmMLA (to determine nonsaturatable binding). α-CTx ImI, α-CTx ImII, or MLA were preincubated with cells for 30 min prior to the addition of 3-125I-α-BgTx (applied in a volume of 4 μl). The radioligand was allowed to bind for 15 min during which its association with receptor was linear with time (data not shown). The assays were quenched with 500 μl of ice-cold d-tubocurarine (2400 μm). The cells were harvested (using a Brandell cell harvester) through Whatman GF-B filters pretreated with 4% nonfat dry milk. The filters were washed three times with about 800 μl of PR and were counted using a COBRAII γ-counter (Packard). Nonsaturatable binding determined in assays containing 100 μm MLA was subtracted from all readings and the resulting specific 3-125I-α-BgTx binding was normalized as a percentage of specific binding in the absence of toxin. Assays were done at 25 ± 2 °C. Data were analyzed and plotted using PRISM software (Graphpad). Competition binding dose response curves were fit to the equation: % binding = 100/(1 + ([toxin]/EC50) n H), and electrophysiological dose response curves were fit to: % response = 100/(1 + ([toxin]/IC50) n H). For α-CTx ImII and [P6R]α-CTx ImI, competition binding assay data were fit to a straight line by linear regression. Members of a conotoxin family, both from a given Conus species as well as from different species, share conserved sequence elements in their gene structure (12Woodward S.R. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. Hillyard D.R. EMBO J. 1990; 1: 1015-1020Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 13Olivera B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2101-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Thus, PCR strategies can amplify fragments of conotoxin genes that include sequence encoding the mature toxin. PCR was used to amplify α-conotoxin gene fragments from C. imperialis genomic DNA and cDNA. The heterogeneous pools of PCR product were cloned and independent clones were sequenced; sequences encoding two closely related peptides, α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII, were found (Fig. 1). The α-CTx ImI peptide had previously been purified from C. imperialis venom (9McIntosh J.M. Yoshikami D. Mahe E. Nielsen D.B. Rivier J.E. Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16733-16739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is a potent and specific competitive inhibitor of rat α7 nAChRs (14Johnson D.S. Martinez J. Elgoyhen A.B. Heinemann S.F. McIntosh J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 194-199PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pereira E.F. Alkondon M. McIntosh J.M. Albuquerque E.X. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 1472-1483PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the predicted sequence from the clone, α-CTx ImII was chemically synthesized and folded to form disulfide bonds (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the synthetic peptide was then used to evaluate potential interactions with α7 nAChRs. α-CTx ImI and α-BgTx have been shown to cause complex seizures when introduced intracranially into rats (14Johnson D.S. Martinez J. Elgoyhen A.B. Heinemann S.F. McIntosh J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 194-199PubMed Google Scholar). This behavior is believed to be because of inhibition of α7 nAChRs. To see if α-CTx ImII caused similar effects, intracranial injections of α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII were made in young mice. As can be seen in Table I, the effects of both toxins were generally similar and are consistent with both toxins acting on the neuronal α7 subtype of the nAChR.Table IDose dependence of effects of α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII on miceAmount of conotoxin injectedNumber of affected animals/totalα-CTx ImIIα-CTx ImInmol1.01 /40 /45.02 /53 /5104 /63 /5253 /32 /3Intracranial injections were made in young mice as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The behavior of the mice was observed for at least 1 h.

The numbers of animals exhibiting clearcut effects divided by the total number injected are shown for each dose. The effects seen were fine to coarse tremors, circling, weak gait and at the higher doses, rolling and death. The ability of α-CTx ImII to inhibit ACh-gated currents through rat α7 nAChRs heterologously expressed in X. laevis oocytes was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” α-CTx ImII inhibits these currents; the concentration dependence of inhibition is shown in Fig. 2. As previously reported (14Johnson D.S. Martinez J. Elgoyhen A.B. Heinemann S.F. McIntosh J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 194-199PubMed Google Scholar), α-CTx ImI was also found to be an inhibitor of oocyte-expressed rat α7 nAChR. Using the protocol described under “Experimental Procedures,” α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII were found to have similar IC50 values (191 nm for α-CTx ImI and 441 nm for α-CTx ImII). The functional inhibition of oocyte-expressed rat α7 nAChRs by 1 μm α-CTx ImII was measured at different holding potentials. As can be seen from Fig. 2 C, the percent block was independent of holding potential indicating that the activity of α-CTx ImII is not voltage-dependent. Block by α-CTx ImI is also voltage-independent (15Pereira E.F. Alkondon M. McIntosh J.M. Albuquerque E.X. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 1472-1483PubMed Google Scholar). α-BgTx is a classical competitive inhibitor of some nAChR subtypes, including the α7 subtype. Therefore, the abilities of α-CTx ImII and α-CTx ImI to inhibit 3-125I-α-bungarotoxin binding to two different rat α7 nAChR preparations were assessed. The ability of α-CTx ImII and α-CTx ImI to compete with 3-125I-α-BgTx for binding to crude rat brain membranes was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 3 A, α-CTx ImII is unable to significantly inhibit 3-125I-α-BgTx binding, whereas α-CTx ImI inhibits all specific 3-125I-α-BgTx binding. This contrasts with the functional inhibition of receptors expressed in oocytes, where both conotoxins exhibited roughly equal IC50 values (compare Fig. 3 A with Fig. 2 A). The 5-HT3 receptor is highly homologous to the α7 nAChR, and the N-terminal ACh-binding domain of the α7 nAChR has been used to replace the N-terminal 5-HT-binding domain from the 5-HT3 receptor (4Cooper S.T.

The resulting chimera can be expressed in HEK293 cells such that α-BgTx-binding sites are produced at a level ∼1000-fold higher than when the native α7 receptor is used (17Quiram P.A. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11001-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, the chimera retains the pharmacology of the wild-type receptor with respect to many cholinergic agonists and antagonists (16Eiselé J.-L. Bertrand S. Galzi J.-L. Devillers-Thiery A. Changeux J.-P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1993; 366: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 17Quiram P.A. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11001-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The ability of α-CTx ImII and α-CTx ImI to inhibit 3-125I-α-BgTx binding to rat α7–5-HT3 chimera was tested as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 3 B, the same pattern of inhibition was seen with the chimera as with the native α7 receptor. Again, α-CTx ImII was unable to significantly block 3-125I-α-BgTx binding, but α-CTx ImI inhibited all specific binding of the radiolabel. It was previously shown using rat hippocampal neurons (15Pereira E.F. Alkondon M. McIntosh J.M. Albuquerque E.X. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 1472-1483PubMed Google Scholar) that preincubation of α7 nAChRs with α-CTx ImI prevents the very slowly reversible functional block by α-BgTx. We have used a similar approach to investigate the functional binding sites of α-CTx ImII and α-CTx ImI on oocyte-expressed rat α7 nAChRs. It was found that a 5-min bath application of 100 nm α-BgTx is sufficient to block about 95% of ACh-gated current in oocytes expressing rat α7 nAChRs. Because of the very slow off-rate of α-BgTx, no significant recovery was observed after washing toxin from the oocyte bath (Fig. 4 A). However, when oocytes were pretreated for 5 min with 100 μm α-CTx ImI and then subjected to a 5-min co-application of α-BgTx and α-CTx ImI, very rapid and essentially full recovery was observed after washing out the toxins. This result is consistent with α-CTx ImI binding preventing the slowly reversible block by α-BgTx, i.e. that the two toxins compete for the same functional site. However, a much more limited ability to protect against block by α-BgTx (Fig. 4 C) is achieved by a similar preincubation with α-CTx ImII. Note that 5 min of bath application of α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII is sufficient for both to reach equilibrium with receptor (see “Experimental Procedures”). The ability of α-CTx ImII to bind to oocyte-expressed receptor was tested with and without pre-equilibration of oocytes with a high concentration of α-CTx ImI. As can be seen in Fig. 5 A, a 5-min bath application of α-CTx ImI (100 μm) or α-CTx ImII (10 μm) is sufficient to completely inhibit ACh-gated ion currents in oocyte-expressed rat α7 nAChRs. Subsequent washout results in full recovery for both toxins; however, α-CTx ImII has a noticeably slower off-rate than α-CTx ImI. Although the differences are subtle, they are highly reproducible and a diagnostic functional difference between the toxins. When 100 μm α-CTx ImI was bath-applied to oocytes expressing rat α7 nAChRs for 10 min, the characteristic fast off-rate of α-CTx ImI was observed (Fig. 5 C). However, when 100 μm α-CTx ImI was bath-applied for 5 min and 10 μm α-CTx ImII was then added, giving 5 min of co-application of α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII, the characteristic slow off-rate for α-CTx ImII was observed, and the result was not detectably different from that of the control experiment in Fig. 5 B (no toxin was applied for 5 min, 10 μmα-CTx ImII was then added for 5 min). This suggests that 100 μm α-CTx ImI does not inhibit α-CTx ImII binding to rat α7 nAChRs despite this concentration being about 520 times greater than the functional IC50. These, as well as the previous data, are consistent with the conclusion that α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII have little if any overlap in their high affinity binding sites on the α7 receptor. Nevertheless, occupancy of the two different sites by each α-conotoxin leads to functional block of the receptor. The peptides α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII are identical in 9 of 12 amino acids. Because they appear to target different sites on the α7 nAChR, we performed a structure/function study to identify which amino acids were critical for the difference in targeting. Of the three differences, those at positions 6 (Pro versus Arg) and 9 (Ala versusArg) seem the most striking. At position 1 (Gly versus Ala), the two residues differ only by a methyl group. Additionally, the absence of a first loop Pro is very unusual in α-conotoxins (see Table II). The two analogs shown in TableII were thus synthesized (see “Experimental Procedures”) and characterized.Table IIα-Conotoxin and analog sequencesSequenceSourceNative α-conotoxins AuIBGCCSYPPCFATNPD C#Conus aulicus EpIGCCSDPRCNMNNPDYC#Conus episcopatus EIRDOCCYHPTCNMSNPQIC#C. ermineus GIECCNPACGRHYSC#C. geographus ImIGCCSDPRCAWRC#C. imperialis ImIIACCSDRRCRWRC#C. imperialis MIGRCCHPACGKNYSC#C. magus MIIGCCSNPVCHLEHSNLC#C. magus PnIAGCCSLPPCAANNPDYC#C. pennaceus SIICCNPACGPKYSC#C. striatus SIAYCCHPACGKNFDC#C. striatusAnalogs P6R ImIGCCSDRRCAWRC# R6P ImIIACCSDPRCRWRC#All the native sequences except α-CTx ImII are from a recent review (1McIntosh J.M.

P6R α-CTx ImI and R6P α-CTx ImII are the analogs described in this study. Both analogs are significantly less functionally potent than the corresponding native peptides as determined by electrophysiological characterization of α7 nAChR inhibition (data not shown). Nevertheless, what is clearly indicated by the data is that the presence of a proline residue at position 6 is the major determinant of whether a peptide will compete with radiolabeled α-bungarotoxin for binding to the α7 receptor (Fig. 6). Thus, R6P α-CTx ImII is better at displacing α-bungarotoxin than native α-CTx ImII. In contrast, replacement of the Pro-6 residue in α-CTx ImI with Arg results in failure to displace α-bungarotoxin even at a concentration of 100 μm (compared with an EC50 for native α-CTx ImI of 407 nm). Thus, the presence or absence of proline at position 6 determines whether or not these peptides preferentially bind to a site that overlaps with the α-bungarotoxin-binding site or another site. We report the discovery and characterization of α-CTx ImII that has high sequence identity (9 of 12 amino acids) to α-CTx ImI (Fig. 1); both peptides are from the venom ducts of C. imperialis (9McIntosh J.M. Yoshikami D. Mahe E. Nielsen D.B. Rivier J.E. Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16733-16739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α-CTx ImI is a specific competitive inhibitor of the α7 nAChR subtype (14Johnson D.S. Martinez J. Elgoyhen A.B. Heinemann S.F. McIntosh J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 194-199PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pereira E.F. Alkondon M. McIntosh J.M. Albuquerque E.X. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 1472-1483PubMed Google Scholar). Given the close sequence similarity of α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII, it was not surprising that α-CTx ImII was also found to inhibit the α7 nAChR. However, most unexpectedly, the two closely related peptides appear to cause their similar functional effects by binding to different sites on the α7 nAChR. α-CTx ImII was found to be similar to α-CTx ImI in the behavioral effects observed when injected intracranially into mice; both peptides elicited complex seizures, weakness, tremors and, at higher doses, death. Similar behavior was also observed following intracerebral-ventricular injection of α-BgTx, another α7 nAChR inhibitor, into rats (14Johnson D.S. Martinez J. Elgoyhen A.B. Heinemann S.F. McIntosh J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 194-199PubMed Google Scholar). In view of its homology to α-CTx ImI and the characteristic symptoms observed when it was injected into the central nervous system, α-CTx ImII was tested for its ability to inhibit ACh-gated currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing rat α7 nAChRs. α-CTx ImII was found to inhibit the receptor with an IC50 similar to that of α-CTx ImI (Fig. 2) when the toxins were tested using identical protocols. The first surprising result was obtained when α-CTx ImII was tested in a competition assay with 3-125I-α-BgTx. As had been previously demonstrated by others (18Quiram P.A. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11007-11011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we found that α-CTx ImI competed with α-BgTx for binding to the receptor. In contrast, α-CTx ImII did not appreciably displace α-BgTx binding in the concentration range tested. These results for α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII were obtained with both rat brain α7 nAChRs (Fig. 3 A) as well as rat α7–5-HT3 chimeras (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, experiments using rat α7 nAChRs expressed in oocytes (Fig. 4) demonstrated that preincubation with α-CTx ImI prevents α-BgTx from binding to its functionally relevant site, a result consistent with competitive antagonism, and previously shown by others (15Pereira E.F. Alkondon M. McIntosh J.M. Albuquerque E.X. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 1472-1483PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, α-CTx ImII had only a very weak effect on α-BgTx inhibition of oocyte-expressed receptor, consistent with a different binding site. The binding site for competitive antagonists of nAChRs is located at the interfaces between subunits that make up the receptor (reviewed in Refs. 19Galzi J.-L. Changeux J.-P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 554-565Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar and 20Galzi J.L. Changeux J.-P. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 563-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The site includes contacts in three conserved loops from one subunit (loops A, B, and C) that make up the “+” face, and four loops from an adjacent subunit (loops I to IV) that make up the “−” face. The binding of α-CTx ImI to the α7 nAChR is affected by mutations in or near loops A, B, and C, and II and III (17Quiram P.A. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11001-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Quiram P.A. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11007-11011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The α-BgTx site on the α7 nAChR has also been mapped to the A, B, and C loops (21Galzi J.L. Bertrand D. Devillers-Thiery A. Ravah F. Bertrand S. Changeux J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and a loop II mutation causes a minor reduction in α-BgTx affinity (22Corringer P.-J. Galzi J.-L. Eiselé J.-L. Bertrand S. Changeux J.-P. Bertrand D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11749-11752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This and other evidence are consistent with α-CTx ImI-binding sites in α7 nAChRs overlapping with ACh and α-BgTx-binding sites, and being at subunit interfaces. The data in Fig. 5 suggest that α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII do not bind to the same site at a subunit interface. Assuming a potential five identical subunit interfaces in the α7 nAChR pentamer, and that occupation of even one site by α-CTx ImI results in inhibition of the receptor, then the concentration of α-CTx ImI that occupies half the potential sites, K d, is related to the functional IC50 by IC50/K d = 0.15 (3Luo S. Nguyen T.A. Cartier G.E. Olivera B.M. Yoshikami D. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14542-14548Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar),i.e. K d = IC50 × 6.67. The IC50 of α-CTx ImI on the α7 nAChR is 191 nm(Fig. 2). Therefore, 100 μm α-CTx ImI (see Fig. 5) would clearly occupy most subunit interface-binding sites on the α7 nAChR (assuming these are identical) and should significantly reduce binding of α-CTx ImII if α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII share a binding site. The α-CTx ImII-binding site awaits definitive characterization; however, several possibilities are outlined below. Because the primary structures of α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII are so similar, and because they share the characteristic α-conotoxin disulfide framework, it seems possible that α-CTx ImII also binds to the interface between α7 subunits. In this case, the inability of α-CTx ImII to compete with α-BgTx or α-CTx ImI might be explained by the following models. One potential explanation for the results is that α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII can simultaneously bind at a single subunit interface by positioning differently within the cleft at different microsites. In fact, α-BgTx appears to make more contacts with the + face than with the − face at α7 nAChR subunit interfaces (21Galzi J.L. Bertrand D. Devillers-Thiery A. Ravah F. Bertrand S. Changeux J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Corringer P.-J. Galzi J.-L. Eiselé J.-L. Bertrand S. Changeux J.-P. Bertrand D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11749-11752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It is possible, for example, that α-CTx ImII binds predominantly to the − face and is thus unable to displace α-BgTx, whereas α-CTx ImI, because of many contacts in the + face, disrupts many α-BgTx-receptor interactions, and is thus able to compete with this toxin. An alternative explanation is based on the work of Green and co-workers (23Rakhilin S. Drisdel R.C. Sagher D. McGehee D.S. Vallejo Y. Green W.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), who have shown that despite amino acid sequence identity, the subunits of a functional α7 nAChR receptor are not identical. Evidence was presented that the functional α7 nAChR complex requires a mixture of α7 subunits that are in at least two states that differ in their N-terminal domain conformation and the oxidation state of Cys residues (23Rakhilin S. Drisdel R.C. Sagher D. McGehee D.S. Vallejo Y. Green W.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A direct consequence of this nonidentity is that putative ligand-binding sites located between subunits become distinguishable. One possibility is that one type of interface between α7 subunits is the α-CTx ImI and α-BgTx-binding site, whereas another type of subunit interface does not bind α-BgTx, but is the α-CTx ImII target site. Bertrand and co-workers (24Palma E. Bertrand S. Binzoni T. Bertrand D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 491: 151-161Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar) have shown that for the competitive α7 nAChR antagonist MLA there are five identical binding sites. This is not necessarily incompatible with a heterogeneous interface model. MLA may recognize structural elements at interfaces that are unaffected by the state of flanking subunits. However, other ligands might be sensitive to the state of flanking subunits and thus have distinguishable interface-binding sites. In fact, there is evidence to support the notion of nonhomogeneous α-BgTx-binding sites on α7 nAChRs (25Rangwala F. Drisdel R.C. Rakhilin S., Ko, E. Atluri P. Harkins A.B. Foy A.P. Salma S.S. Green W.N. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8201-8212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, in mouse brain, some [3H]MLA-binding sites are resistant to competition by α-BgTx (26Whiteaker P. Davis A.R. Marks M.S. Blagbrough I.S. Potter B.V. Wolstenholme A.J. Collins A.C. Wonnacott S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar); because the resistant fraction does not appear to be because of a distinct MLA receptor, a simple explanation could be that MLA binds to all five subunit interfaces but α-BgTx, even at high concentrations, cannot. Although α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII show extensive sequence homology, it is possible that α-CTx ImII binds to a nonsubunit-interface site on the receptor. For example, it might bind extracellular regions of the receptor that are not in the N-terminal ACh-binding domain,i.e. the extracellular loop that occurs between two transmembrane helices of the α7 nAChR or the C-terminal extracellular region. α-CTx ImII could also potentially bind to nonsubunit interface regions on the N-terminal ACh-binding domain or the channel pore; however, because α-CTx ImII block is not voltage dependent, this supports the model that it is not an open channel blocker. The experiments with analogues suggest that although α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII have very similar sequences, the amino acid residue at position 6 (Pro in α-CTx ImI, Arg in α-CTx ImII) is critical in determining where they bind on the α7 nAChR. Relative to wild-type α-CTx ImI, P6R α-CTx ImI is a very poor competitor of α-BgTx binding to α7–5-HT3 chimera. In contrast, R6P α-CTx ImII has an enhanced ability to compete with α-BgTx compared with wild-type α-CTx ImII. Because the two native toxins apparently target different sites, a key determinant for selectivity is which amino acid is present at position 6. Additional information about interactions of α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII with their distinct binding sites can be derived from the analog toxin data if one assumes the initial Gly and Ala residues in the two toxins are functionally equivalent. In this case, the P6R α-CTx ImI analog is equivalent to R9A α-CTx ImII and the R6Pα-CTx-ImII analog is equivalent to A9R α-CTx-ImI. Because P6R α-CTx ImI does not compete with α-BgTx for binding to the α7 nAChR, this strongly suggests that R9A α-CTx ImII would be like α-CTx ImII and also not compete with α-BgTx. Because R6P α-CTx ImII has some ability to compete α-BgTx but is not as potent as α-CTx ImI, this strongly suggests that A9R α-CTx ImI would compete with α-BgTx for binding to the α7 nAChR but would be a less potent competitor than α-CTx ImI. Taken together, these observations imply that the residues at position 9 in α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII are not critical in determining whether the α-CTx ImI or α-CTx ImII site is targeted, but are important for ensuring optimal affinity of α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII for their respective sites. The discovery of α-CTx ImII reveals that C. imperialis has two toxins that inhibit the rat α7 nAChR, and that these act at different sites. Although caution must be applied when extrapolating this observation to the native prey, it suggests that C. imperialis may target marine worms with both α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII, which may bind to different sites on an “α7-like” receptor in native prey. This would represent a second example of cone snail venom containing two distinct antagonists of the same nAChR. It was previously demonstrated thatConus purpurascens produces two structurally unrelated nAChR antagonists, a competitive αA-conotoxin and a noncompetitive ψ-conotoxin (reviewed in Ref. 1McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The present case is different, however, in that the toxins are both α-conotoxins that are very closely related to each other in sequence. A caveat that must be applied to this model is that natural, venom-derived α-CTx ImII may possess post-translational modifications that were not incorporated in the synthetic peptide used in this study. The native toxin may thus differ from the synthetic molecule in its functional properties,i.e. it may not target an α7-like receptor at all. On the other hand, post-translational modification in α-conotoxins isolated from venom have so far been limited to C-terminal amidation and tyrosine sulfation (α-CTx ImI and α-CTx ImII lack tyrosine residues). Previously, it has been shown that very minor changes in the intercysteine amino acid sequences of conotoxins can drastically affect their specificity. The toxins α-CTx PnIA and α-CTx PnIB fromConus pennaceus are different in only 2 of 16 amino acids, but preferentially block α3β2 and α7 nAChRs, respectively (3Luo S. Nguyen T.A. Cartier G.E. Olivera B.M. Yoshikami D. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14542-14548Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The discovery of α-CTx ImII illustrates that in C. imperialis, minor differences between two toxins result in molecules that target, not distinct receptor subtypes, but distinct sites on a single nAChR subtype.

DAP4, which is encoded by a member of a vertebrate-only gene family, contains no identifiable domains, but is identical over its amino-terminal 488 amino acids to p52rIPK, a putative modulator of protein kinase R. DAP4 is a widely expressed, constitutively nuclear polypeptide that homodimerizes through its amino terminus and binds MST1 through its carboxyl-terminal segment. MST1 is predominantly cytoplasmic, but cycles continuously through the nucleus, as evidenced by its rapid accumulation in the nucleus after addition of the Crm1 inhibitor, leptomycin B. Overexpression of DAP4 does not cause apoptosis, however, coexpression of DAP4 with a submaximal amount of MST1 enhances MST1-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion. DAP4 is not significantly phosphorylated by MST1 nor does it alter MST1 kinase activity in vivo or in vitro. MST1-induced apoptosis is suppressed by a dominant interfering mutant of p53. MST1 is unable to directly phosphorylate p53, however, DAP4 binds endogenous and recombinant p53. DAP4 may promote MST1-induced apoptosis by enabling colocalization of MST with p53. The protein kinase MST1 is proapoptotic when overexpressed in an active form, however, its physiologic regulation and cellular targets are unknown. An overexpressed inactive MST1 mutant associates in COS-7 cells with an endogenous 761-amino acid polypeptide known as “death-associated protein 4” (DAP4). The DAPs are a functionally heterogeneous array of polypeptides previously isolated by Kimchi and colleagues (Kimchi, A. (1998) Biochim. Biophys.

MST1 (1Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21695-21700Google Scholar) (also known as Krs-2 (2Taylor L.K. Wang H.C. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10099-10104Google Scholar)) is a 487-aa 1The abbreviations used are: aa, amino acid(s); SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; DAP, death associated protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody. mammalian protein kinase best classified as a group II GC kinase (3Dan I.

MST1 (and its close homolog MST2/Krs-1) contains a Ste20-related kinase catalytic domain in the amino-terminal segment (aa 30–270) followed by a noncatalytic tail that contains successively an autoinhibitory domain (aa 331–394), a dimerization domain (after aa 431), and a nuclear localization signal at the COOH terminus (1Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21695-21700Google Scholar, 2Taylor L.K. Wang H.C. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10099-10104Google Scholar, 5Creasy C.L. Ambrose D.M. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21049-21053Google Scholar). Although initially identified as a kinase activated late after transformation by v-Src, MST kinase activity can also be activated by certain severe stresses, such as 0.25 m sodium arsenite or heat shock at 55 °C, as well as by protein phosphatase inhibitors such as okadaic acid (2Taylor L.K. Wang H.C. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10099-10104Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the physiologic regulation of MST1 and -2 remains obscure. MST1 contains a caspase 3 cleavage site at DMED326, just amino-terminal to the autoinhibitory domain, and cleavage of MST1 occurs during apoptosis initiated by a variety of stimuli, which yields a 36-kDa catalytic fragment whose specific activity is increased about 10-fold over the parent MST1 (6Graves J.D.

In addition, overexpression of either wild-type MST1 or a carboxyl-terminal truncated mutant (but not a kinase inactive MST) is itself sufficient to initiate apoptosis. Reciprocally, overexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant of MST1 is able to partially suppress the apoptosis induced by the anti-tumor agents cytotrienin A (9Watabe M. Kakeya H. Onose R. Osada H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8766-8771Google Scholar), MT-21 (10Watabe M. Kakeya H. Osada H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5211-5220Google Scholar), or staurosporine, suggesting that the recruitment of MST plays a significant role in the apoptosis induced by these agents. The mechanism of MST-induced apoptosis is not well defined; overexpression of MST1 is accompanied by activation of SAPK/JNK (6Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2224-2234Google Scholar, 9Watabe M. Kakeya H. Onose R. Osada H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8766-8771Google Scholar, 11Graves J.D. Draves K.E. Gotoh Y. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14909-14915Google Scholar), and coexpression with a dominant inhibitory SAPK mutant partially suppresses MST1-induced apoptosis (12Ura S. Masuyama N. Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 519-530Google Scholar). Moreover, whereas wild-type MST1 is a cytoplasmic protein, caspase-cleaved MST enters the nucleus and induces chromatin condensation followed by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (13Ura S. Masuyama N. Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10148-10153Google Scholar, 14Lee K.K. Ohyama T. Yajima N. Tsubuki S. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19276-19285Google Scholar), suggesting that nuclear entry of MST may be important to the expression of its proapoptotic action. In an effort to gain further insight into the mechanism of MST1 cellular actions, we transiently overexpressed a kinase-inactive, caspase-resistant mutant of MST1 and analyzed by mass spectrometry the polypeptides recovered in association with MST1. Herein we characterize the physical and functional interactions of MST1 with one candidate partner identified thereby, death-associated protein 4 (DAP4). In an effort to identify proteins that associate with MST1 in intact cells with sufficient avidity to survive extraction and washing, a FLAG-tagged MST1 was overexpressed transiently in COS-7 cells and recovered by affinity purification on anti-FLAG-agarose. The MST1 was rendered kinase inactive by mutation at the ATP binding site (K59R) so as to avoid the induction of apoptosis, and the caspase 3 cleavage site was also mutated (D326N). Cells transfected in parallel with empty vector were processed in tandem. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were extracted into buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 A with protease inhibitors. The supernatant of a 13,500 × g, 15-min centrifugation was adsorbed onto FLAG-agarose, washed extensively in the lysis buffer with and without 1 m NaCl, eluted at pH 2.5, concentrated, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After staining with Coomassie Blue, the lane containing the sample prepared from cells transfected with empty vector showed only a faint band of light chain; the lane containing FLAG-MST1 exhibited a major band at 61 kDa and 10 minor bands at about 1–10% abundance of the 61-kDa FLAG-MST1. Each of the latter was excised, subjected to tryptic digestion in situ, and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry, using the nanospray MS-MS approach (15Figeys D. McBroom L.D. Moran M.F. Methods. 2001; 24: 230-239Google Scholar). Among the seven bands atMr < 61,000, five were fragments of MST1. Among the three bands at Mr > 61,000, two were heat shock proteins (HSP 90 and 70). A third band, atMr 88,000, contained 5 tryptic peptide fragments, two of which could be assigned to p52rIPK(regulator of the inhibitor ofprotein kinae R), a 492-amino acid polypeptide modulator of the PKR inhibitor, p58IPK (16Gale Jr., M. Blakely C.M. Hopkins D.A. Melville M.W. Wambach M. Romano P.R. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 859-871Google Scholar), and three other tryptic peptides that could be identified within the human expressed sequence tag polypeptide GI1616050 (AA076164). Alignment of overlapping human, mouse, and rat expressed sequence tags enabled the assembly of a sequence that extended amino-terminal from GI1616050 to produce an identical overlap with amino acids 389–488 of p52rIPK. Combining the sequence of p52rIPK and the overlapping human, mouse, and rat expressed sequence tags yielded a polypeptide of 761 amino acids. Blast of this combined sequence against human genomic sequences yielded several matches exceeding 90% on different chromosomes. Shortly thereafter a 761-amino acid sequence was deposited in the nonredundant data bank (accession number AF081567) by Barzilay and Kimchi under the name “death-associated protein 4,” which differed at five amino acids from our assembled sequence. The sequence of DAP4 is shown in Fig. 1A; it is identical with p52rIPK over the NH2-terminal 488 amino acids. DAP4 was cloned from human skeletal muscle cell cDNA library using PCR 5′ primer, GCGGGATCCATGCCGAACTTCTGCGCTGCC, and 3′ primer, GGCGGCCGCTTAGGTATTTTCCACAGTTTC. Mouse MST1 cDNA was kindly provided by Leonard Zon (Children's Hospital, Boston, MA). Constructs encoding wild-type p53 and a mutant p53 miniprotein (p53 aa 302–393) (17Shaulian E. Zauberman A. Ginsberg D. Oren M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5581-5592Google Scholar, 18Gottlieb E. Haffner R. von Ruden T. Wagner E.F. Oren M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1368-1374Google Scholar) were generous gifts from Dr. Moshe Oren. DNA manipulations were performed using the standard techniques (19Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Third Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Full-length, truncated, and point mutations of constructs were subcloned into different plasmids including pCMV5 FLAG, pEBG GST, pEGFP-C1, pEGFP-N1, and pdsRed-N1. All the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. COS-7, HEK 293, and HeLa cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin in 10% CO2atmosphere at 37 °C. NIH 3T3 were cultivated as above except 10% bovine calf serum (Invitrogen) was used. Cells were replaced at a density of 3–5 × 106 per 10-cm dish and transfected 5 h later with a total of 8 μg of DNA and 30 μl of LipofectAMINE per dish following the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen). The binding assays in vitro employed extracts from HEK 293 cells expressing recombinant FLAG or GST fusion proteins individually. At 48 h after transfection, cells were snap frozen and stored at −70 °C until use. One 10-cm dish of frozen cells was scraped into 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris base, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 nm calyculin A, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 tablet/50 ml of protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Lysates were centrifuged at 13,500 rpm for 10 min. Aliquots of the supernatants containing equal amounts of protein, measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), were added to 15 μl of settled GSH-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, once with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.5 mLiCl, and again with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Thereafter, aliquots of the lysate from the FLAG fusion protein-transfected cells matched for proteins were added to the beads and incubated at 4 °C for another 3 h. The beads were then washed extensively and adsorbed proteins were eluted in 15 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 10 min, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with antibodies as indicated. Blots were visualized using horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary antibody followed by chemiluminescence as outlined by the manufacturer (Pierce). The studies of binding in vivo, mapping of the sites of DAP4/MST1 association, DAP4/p53 association, and DAP4 dimerization were carried out after cotransfection of the constructs indicated into COS-7 or HEK 293 cells. The procedures of cell lysis and immunoaffinity purification were as described above. HEK 293, HeLa, and NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in 60-mm plates and transfected with 3–4 μg of GFP/red fluorescent protein-tagged cDNA constructs using 15 μl of LipofectAMINE. In some cases, 6 μl of FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or 15 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) were used. At 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated with 0.2 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 30 min at 37 °C and observed directly by fluorescence microscopy. The same plates were also observed after 48 and 72 h transfection. To examine the effect of leptomycin B on cellular localization, 10 ng/ml leptomycin B or carrier was added to the cells at 24 h after transfection, and images were taken from 20 min to 1 h after addition of leptomycin B. When used for immunocytochemistry, cells were seeded onto glass coverslips 24 h before the transfection. At the times indicated after transfection, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in methanol for 10 min, and blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 10 min. Anti-FLAG mAb (10 μg/ml) was added for 30 min followed by washing with PBS. The secondary antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Cappel), was used at a 1:400 dilution for 30 min then washed with PBS. Cells were incubated with 0.2 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for an additional 30 min and washed again in PBS. The coverslips were then mounted on a glass slide using Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology). Images were collected using a Zeiss Axiovert S100M microscope (Carl Zeiss) connected to a CCD camera. The figures were prepared using MetaMorph Imaging software (Universal Imaging). The method used for measuring cell death was modified from Rabizadeh et al. (20Rabizadeh S. Ye X. Wang J.J. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1222-1227Google Scholar) and Sperandioet al. (21Sperandio S. de Belle I. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14376-14381Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 1 × 106 cells were seeded in 60-mm plates and 15 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 was used. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours after transfection, the pro-apoptotic agent tamoxifen was added at a final concentration of 20–25 μm to increase the rate of apoptosis. Floating cells were collected at 20–24 h after the addition of tamoxifen and cell death was assessed by trypan blue exclusion method. For the experiment shown in Fig. 7, HEK 293 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged MST1 and DAP4 (total 8 μg/plate in a 60-mm plate) using LipofectAMINE; some cells were incubated with zVAD-fmk at 50 μm (BioMol) and other cells were transfected with plasmid encoding BV p35 (22Fisher A.J. Cruz W. Zoog S.J. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2031-2039Google Scholar) along with the DAP4 and MST1. At 72 h after transfection, cells were rinsed, frozen, and harvested into 0.6 ml of lysis buffer, followed by centrifugation at 13,500 × g for 10 min. Supernatant were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with anti-FLAG antibody prebound to protein G beads. The beads were then washed 4 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and 3 times with 1 ml of kinase buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate). The kinase assay was performed in 30 μl of reaction buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.8 μg/μl histone 2B, 100 μm ATP, and 2 μCi/tube) for 15 min at 30 °C on a thermomixer. The reaction was stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer to 1× concentration followed by boiling for 5 min. An aliquot of the sample was separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and staining with Coomassie Blue, the 32P incorporation into DAP4, MST1, and H2B was quantified by phosphorimaging. The same membrane was used for immunoblot determination of polypeptide abundance after decay of the32P signal. In the experiments shown in Figs. 8, A and B, and 9C, the kinase assay was performed as above except using purified, soluble proteins. To obtain the proteins, individual FLAG-tagged constructs were transfected into HEK 293 cells. At 48 h after transfection, the clarified supernatant of a concentrated cell lysate was incubated with 15 μl of FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma) for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 4 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, 4 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.5 mLiCl, and the FLAG-tagged proteins were then eluted by three successive incubations in lysis buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) for 10 min on ice. The elutes were combined and centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 × g through Spin-X centrifuge tube filters (Corning).Figure 9p53 participates in MST1-induced cell death. A, the effect of dominant inhibitory p53 miniprotein (p53 aa 302–393, p53 C-fg, Refs 17Shaulian E. Zauberman A. Ginsberg D. Oren M. Mol. Cell.

HEK 293 cells were transfected with equal amounts of total DNA as indicated. Cell death induced by p53 or MST in the absence and presence of the p53 miniprotein was measured. A representative immunoblot of polypeptide expression in selected conditions is shown; an actin blot was used as a control. B, DAP4 binds p53.Left panel, binding of p53 to DAP4 or MST1 in vitro: HEK 293 cells were transfected with vectors encoding GST (G), GST-MST1 (G-MST1), GST-DAP4 (G-DAP4), or FLAG-p53 (F-p53). The GST proteins were immobilized on GSH-agarose, washed, and then the lysates from FLAG-p53-transfected cells were added to the GSH-agarose beads. After washing, the bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-FLAG mAb. Middle panel, association of coexpressed DAP4 and p53. Plasmids encoding GST (G) or a GST-DAP4 fusion protein (G-DAP4) were each coexpressed in HEK 293 cells with empty FLAG vector or FLAG-p53 (F-p53). The FLAG blot of the GSH-agarose isolate is shown in the bottom. Right panel, recombinant DAP4 binds endogenous p53. HEK 293 cells were transfected with FLAG (F) or FLAG-DAP4 (F-DAP4). FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG mAb prebound to protein G. The bead was subjected to intensive washed and run on 10% SDS-PAGE. The endogenous p53 blotting is shown in thebottom. C, SAPK, but not MST1 phosphorylates p53 in vitro. FLAG-p53 were expressed transiently in HEK 293 cells, purified, and eluted from FLAG-agarose. A phosphorylation reaction was carried out in vitro using purified recombinant MST1 or SAPK as described under “Materials and Methods.” H2B was included as a positive control. All the blots are representative of one experiment repeated 2–3 times. Data are mean ± S.E. (n = 3). *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Treatment effects were evaluated using a two-tailed Student'st test. A p value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. DAP4 was identified as a polypeptide that was co-isolated with recombinant, kinase-inactive MST1 (see “Materials and Methods”). In view of the prior recovery of DAP4 in a functional screen for elements involved in interferon-induced apoptosis, we attempted to determine whether DAP4 participated in MST-induced apoptosis. Blast of the DAP4 polypeptide sequence against the human genome sequence data base yields seven polypeptide sequences (shown in Fig. 1A) that exhibit >75% identity in amino sequence with DAP4; we have arbitrarily named these polypeptides as DAP4A (Chr11) through DAP4G(Chr1) in order of decreasing identity. In addition, other homologous sequences can be identified at a second site on Chr11 (65% identity to DAP4), on Chr13 (63% identity), Chr4 (52% identity), Chr6 (45% identity), and Chr15 (47% identity), with probable additional homologues on Chr6, -13, -1, and -12, and a third homologous gene on Chr11; altogether 17 humanDAP4-related genes were identifiable. The DAP4ADNA sequence on Chr11 is identical to the deposited DAP4cDNA, and certainly encodes the gene corresponding this cDNA polypeptide. The DAP4A gene contains at least three introns, and the DAP4C sequence on Chr3 contains at least one intron, however, the DAP4B sequence on chromosome 8 lacks introns, and may represent a processed psuedogene. Among these polypeptides only the genes on Chr11 (DAP4A) and Chr3 (DAP4C) encode sequences identical to the five peptides identified by MS analysis of the 88-kDa MST1-associated polypeptide (indicated in Fig. 1), and the sequence on Chr8 (DAP4B) differs by 1 aa of the aggregate 66 aa within these peptides. Based on available data we conclude that the polypeptide recovered in association with MST1 is either DAP4A (=DAP4) or DAP4C; the latter is 87% identical in amino acid sequence to DAP4A. The DAP4 polypeptides contain no domain motifs identifiable within the Prosite, Pfam, or Interpro algorithrims. A polyclonal antibody was raised against the synthetic peptide Cys-KSELPTDNSETVENT, coupled through its amino terminus to KLH. This sequence corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acids of DAP4A, and is highly conserved among the DAP4-related gene products described in Fig. 1A. Immunoblot of extracts prepared from a variety of human cell lines, using affinity purified anti-DAP4A(CT peptide) IgG (Fig. 1B) showed the ubiquitous presence of a single major polypeptide band at ∼88 kDa, which we presume to be DAP4A, and perhaps one or more of the closely related gene products indicated in Fig. 1, many of which differ in length from DAP4A by less than 15 amino acids. Some extracts exhibit a second, faint band at ∼103 kDa; the identity of this polypeptide is unknown. Thus, DAP4-related polypeptides are commonly expressed in human cell lines. We next employed PCR to isolate, from a human skeletal muscle library, a cDNA corresponding exactly in sequence to the human DAP4A, and proceeded to characterize its properties and its interactions with MST1. Plasmids encoding GST or a GST-DAP4 fusion protein were expressed separately in HEK 293 cells and each recombinant GST polypeptide was immobilized at comparable concentrations by adsorption to GSH-agarose. Extracts of cells transfected with FLAG-MST1, FLAG-MST (K59R), or empty vector were matched for protein content and incubated with immobilized GST proteins; after washing, the adsorbed proteins were eluted, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and probed with anti-FLAG antibody. As seen in Fig. 2A, both wild-type and kinase-inactive MST1 polypeptides bind specifically to GST-DAP4. We next examined the ability of MST1 and DAP4 to associate during transient coexpression. Both FLAG-MST1 wild-type (Fig. 2A) and K59R (not shown) bind specifically to GST-DAP4. The binding site on DAP4 for MST1 is located carboxyl-terminal to aa 362, and predominantly after aa 489; thus MST1 associates with a segment in the carboxyl-terminal half of DAP4 that is mostly distal to the p52rIPK splice site. Recombinant DAP4 is capable of homodimerization during transient expression, as demonstrated by the specific recovery of coexpressed FLAG-DAP4 with GST-DAP4; DAP4 homodimerization is mediated by the DAP4 amino-terminal segment aa 1–488 (Fig. 3A); self-association increases progressively as the amino-terminal fragment is lengthened from 60 to 300 amino acids, mediating that the self-association surface involves most of the amino-terminal half of DAP4 (Fig. 3B). These results also indicate that DAP4 is as likely to dimerize with the p52rIPK splice variant as with the full-length DAP4 polypeptide. We next ascertained the cellular localization of DAP4 by examining the distribution of recombinant FLAG-DAP4 or DAP4 fused in-frame with eGFP, either at the DAP4 NH2 or COOH terminus; all three DAP4 polypeptides gave indistinguishable results. DAP4 localizes exclusively in the nucleus, whether examined in HeLa (Fig. 3C), HEK 293, or NIH 3T3 cells (not shown). DAP4 nuclear localization is determined by sequences near the DAP4 amino terminus, between aa 1 and 120 (Fig. 3D). In contrast to DAP4, GFP-MST1 is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3C), at least prior to the onset of apoptosis. The finding that endogenous DAP4 can be recovered from the cell in association with MST1, together with the presence of a classical bipartite nuclear localization signal at the MST1 carboxyl terminus (aa 469–487) led us to inquire whether MST1 enters and exits the nucleus; we therefore coexpressed GFP-MST1 with red fluorescent protein-DAP4 in several cell types, and followed the localization of these polypeptides over time; the localization of these two polypeptides remained distinct (Fig. 4A) until the onset of apoptosis and nuclear membrane breakdown, whereupon substantial overlap ensued (not shown). If, however, NIH 3T3 cells expressing GFP-MST1 were treated with leptomycin B, an inhibitor of CrmA-mediated nuclear export (23Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Google Scholar), substantial MST1-GFP fluorescence became evident in the nucleus within 20 min (Fig. 4B); identical results were seen in the HeLa cells. Thus MST1 is transiting rapidly through the nucleus, with its export mediated by the leptomycin B-sensitive CrmA nuclear export apparatus. We next sought to define the MST1 NES signals; the MST1 carboxyl-terminal tail contains two candidate leucine-rich NES motifs, at aa 361–370 and 444–451 (Fig. 5A). Each was mutated separately as shown in Fig. 5B, resulting in the partial localization of FLAG-MST to the nucleus. Concurrent mutation of both motifs resulted in the exclusive localization of MST1 to the nucleus. Similar findings were reported by Ura et al. (13Ura S. Masuyama N. Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Proc. Natl.

In summary, DAP4 is a constitutively nuclear protein that can bind directly the protein kinase MST1; the latter in turn cycles in and of the nucleus.Figure 4MST1 cycles between cytoplasm and nucleus. A, HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-MST1 and DAP4-red fluorescent protein using FuGENE according to the manufacturer's instruction.

https://openalex.org/W2061071151,"A sensitive, specific, reproducible, robust, and cost-effective customized cDNA array system based on established nylon membrane technology has been developed for convenient multisample expression profiling for several hundred genes of choice. The genes represented are easily adjusted (depending on the availability of corresponding cDNAs) and the method is accordingly readily applicable to a wide variety of systems. Here we have focused on the expression profiles for interferon-α2a, the most widely used interferon for the treatment of viral hepatitis and malignancies, in primary cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells, T cells, and dendritic cells) and cell lines (Kit255, HT1080, HepG2, and HuH7). Of 150 genes studied, only six were consistently induced in all cell types and donors, whereas 74 genes were induced in at least one cell type. IRF-7 was identified as the only gene exclusively induced in the hematopoietic cells. No gene was exclusively induced in the nonhematopoietic cell lines. In T cells 12, and in dendritic cells, 25 genes were induced in all donors whereas 45 and 42 genes, respectively, were induced in at least one donor. The data suggest that signaling through IFN-α2 can be substantially modulated to yield significant cell-type and donor-specific qualitative and quantitative differences in gene expression in response to this cytokine under highly standardized conditions.

Type I (predominantly α and β) and type II (γ) IFNs 1The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; DC, dendritic cell; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cells; TC, peripheral blood T cells; rIL, recombinant interleukin; LB, Luria-Bertani; RPA, RNase protection assay; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; ISGF, interferon-stimulated gene factorplay a central role in mediating antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory responses. The pathways that are involved in IFN-induced gene expression include specific type I and II receptors, JAKs and STATs (1Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, STATs form homo- or heterodimers through phosphotyrosine-SH2 interactions following activation by JAKs. Whereas STAT dimers bind to γ-activated sequence elements, both STAT1–2 heterodimers and STAT1 homodimers bind to p48 (ISGF-3γ/IRF-9) resulting in a trimer that binds to interferon-stimulated regulatory elements in promoters of responsive genes (2Bluyssen A.R. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To date the gene expression profile induced by IFN-α2 has been studied predominantly in fibrosarcoma and melanoma cell lines (3Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar, 4Certa U. Seiler M. Padovan E. Spagnoli G.C. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 85: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Little is known about the transcriptional profiles for other cell lines and nontransformed cells or of donor-specific differences. The definition of cell-type and donor-specific quantitative and qualitative differences is, however, central to a full understanding of the biology of the IFNs and their mechanisms of action. Approaches through expression profiling are also of potential clinical importance. IFN-α2 is widely used in the treatment of diseases including chronic viral hepatitis B and C and several malignancies (5McHutchison J.G. Gordon S.C. Schiff E.R. Shiffman M.L. Lee W.M.

Gluud C. Br. Med. J. 2001; 323: 1151-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The definition of gene expression profiles that correspond to “response” or “nonresponse” should ultimately result in further optimization of IFN treatment. Genes that are abnormally expressed in “nonresponders” to IFN-α2 may define novel pharmacological targets and provide further insight into the pathophysiology of the underlying disease. To address these questions it is critical to use read-out systems that cover expression from a large number of genes. Technological advances have made possible the simultaneous detection of thousands of gene transcripts using small tissue or cell samples. These technologies include DNA chips (high density oligoarrays (8Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat.

Although large scale array techniques are particularly useful to give a broad view of gene expression changes between samples and to discover “novel” genes that are induced by a particular cytokine or drug, they are, in general, costly, labor intensive, and unsuitable for the assay of multiple samples necessary for the detailed analysis of cytokine responses. Appropriate, customized, nylon membrane-based filter arrays, however, are attractive for precisely such analyses. Here, we describe a customized cDNA array system that is specific, sensitive, robust, reproducible, convenient to use, and cost-effective. Using this technology we have defined significant quantitative and qualitative differences in the response of cells of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic origin to IFN-α2a under highly standardized conditions. Substantial quantitative and qualitative donor-specific differences for T cells and DC were observed in response to this cytokine. Human HT1080 (fibrosarcoma), HepG2 (hepatoma), HuH7 (hepatoma), and Kit255 (T cell lymphoma) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2. Recombinant human IFN-α2a was provided by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The human IL-2-dependent T cell line Kit255 (26Hori T. Uchiyama T. Tsudo M. Umadome H. Ohno H. Fukuhara S. Kita K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 70: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 20 ng/ml rIL-2 (Proleukin, Chiron, Emeryville, CA). Prior to treatment of cells with IFN-α2, Kit255 cells were washed and then cultured for 48 h in the absence of rIL-2. PBMC were isolated from buffy coat by density centrifugation on Lymphoprep (Nycomed, Norway). To obtain TC, PBMC were activated with phytohemagglutinin (Murex, UK) and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal calf serum and human rIL-2 (20 ng/ml) for 1 week. Prior to treatment of cells with IFN-α2, TC were washed and then cultured for 48 h in the absence of rIL-2. To generate DC, monocytes were isolated from PBMC by magnetic cell sorting using anti-CD14-conjugated magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Cologne, Germany) and cultured for 6 days in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and 50 ng/ml IL-4 (both from R&D Systems). All experiments were performed under stringent endotoxin-free conditions. Total RNA was isolated from cells using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. RNA quantity and quality was analyzed by spectrophotometry and additional visualization by agarose gel electrophoresis. Genes of interest were selected from the UniGene data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/Hs.Home.html). 5′ IMAGE clones with 0.5–0.8 kb length were chosen and ordered from the Human Genome Mapping Project, Hinxton, UK (www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk). Bacteria were streaked out onto 1.5% LB-agar plates containing 75 μg/ml ampicillin and cultured overnight at 37 °C. Single clones were picked, transferred to 96-well plates with 200 μl of LB medium containing 75 μg/ml ampicillin and 10% glycerol, and grown overnight at 37 °C in an incubator without shaking. A 1/10 dilution of individual clones was set up in 96-well plates by adding 10 μl of bacterial culture to 90 μl of sterile ddH2O. Throughout the duration of the experiments, the number of genes present on the filters was constantly extended from 150 to 231 genes (Fig. 1 A), reflecting the flexibility of the method. The data presented here are, however, restricted to the initial 150 genes (Table I).Table IComplete list of genes investigated in this studyGeneAccession No.GeneAccession No.GeneAccession No.2–5-A synthetaseX02875HouU32849NKC-4M598075′ NucleotidaseX55740HPAST proteinAF001434p48/ISGF-3γ/IRF-9M8750360 S Ribosomal protein L11U43522Hypoxia-induced factor-1U22431Phospholipid scramblase 1AF0986426–16U22970ICAM-1M24283PIAS x-βAF07795472-kDa type IV collagenaseJ03210ICSB 1M91196Pim-1M167509–27J04164IFI-16M63838PKRU50648α-1-AntiproteinaseK01396IFI-41L22342Placental calcium-binding proteinM80563Auto Ag SS-A/RoNM003141IFN-αR1J03171PLOD2U84573BST2D28137IFN-αR2L42243PML-1M79462BTG1X61123IFN-γM29383PPP3CAL14778CalcyclinJ02763IFN-γR1J03143PRAMEU65011CASP proteinAJ006470IFN-γR2U05875Prolyl-4-hydroxylase αM24486Caspase 8X98172IFP-35U72882Proton-ATPase-like proteinD89052Caspase-1M87507IFP-53X62570Putative serine/threonine kinaseG833810Catecholo-methyltransferaseM58525IL-1αM28983Pyridoxal kinaseU89606Cathepsin DM11233IL-10RαU00672RAP46/Bag-1Z35491CCR1L09230IL-10RβZ17227RbAp48X74262CCR5U54994IL-12Rβ2U64198ReticulocalbinD42073CIITAX74301IL-15U14407RHO GDP-diss.

The cDNA inserts were amplified in the presence of 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm of each of the deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and 50 units of Taqpolymerase using the following conditions: initial denaturation 94 °C, 3 min; denaturation 94 °C, 40 s; annealing 55 °C, 30 s; elongation 72 °C, 1 min for 30 cycles followed by a final elongation at 72 °C, 7 min using the M13 forward primer (5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′) and the M13 reverse primer (5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′). The PCR-amplified DNA was diluted 1/2 with Tris/EDTA, pH 8.0, in round-bottom 96-well plates, and stored at −20 °C. This DNA was used for spotting onto nylon membranes. To confirm the identity of the IMAGE clones, DNA was PCR amplified in 50-μl reactions, purified (QIAquick PCR purification kit, Qiagen, Crawley, UK), and sequenced (ABI Prism, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Membranes (Hybond N+,Amersham Biosciences) were cut (12.5 × 8 cm), placed on top of one 3MM sheet (12.5 × 8 cm) and assembled on an aluminum board using a registration device (V&P Scientific, San Diego, CA, catalog number VP382). 96-pin replicators (V&P Scientific, catalog number VP409) were treated with surfactant (V&P Scientific, catalog number VP110) prior to use according to the manufacturer's instructions. Library copiers (V&P Scientific, catalog number VP381) were used for exact positioning of the replicator on the 96-well plates containing the amplified IMAGE clones. DNA was then transferred from 96-well plates to the membranes using 96-pin replicators (1 stroke). Each clone was spotted in triplicate. Membranes were dried overnight at room temperature. Batches of four membranes were transferred to plastic boxes (20 × 20 × 5 cm) and the DNA was denatured in 1 liter of 0.66 m NaCl, 0.5 m NaOH for 10 min at room temperature. The membranes were washed in 1 liter of deionized water, neutralized (40 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.2), and rewashed with deionized water all for 10 min at room temperature in an orbital shaker. Prior to use, the DNA on the membranes was UV cross-linked (120,000 μJ/cm2). Radiolabeled cDNA was generated from 5 to 40 μg of total RNA by reverse transcriptase at 42 °C for 2 h using 360 units of reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Invitrogen), dATP, dTTP, dGTP (0.5 mm each, AmershamBiosciences), and dCTP (2 μm, Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 30 μCi of [α-33P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, catalog number NEG613H), T23ACG anchored primers (1 μg), and RNase inhibitor (40 units Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands, catalog number 300–151) in a total volume of 30 μl. After reverse transcription, residual RNA was hydrolyzed by alkaline treatment (15 μl of 0.1 m NaOH) at 70 °C for 20 min followed by neutralization with 15 μl of 0.1 mHCl. To remove unincorporated nucleotides the 33P-labeled cDNA was purified using Sephadex columns (ProbeQuant G-50, AmershamBiosciences, catalog number 27-5330-01). Before hybridization to the arrays, the labeled cDNA was mixed with 50 μg of COT1-DNA (Invitrogen, catalog number 15279-011) and 10 μg of poly(dA) DNA (Amersham Biosciences, catalog number 27-7836-02) in 4× SSC, 0.1% SDS, denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, and hybridized for 1 h to minimize nonspecific binding to repetitive sequences and the poly(A) tail. After denaturation, the cDNA was added directly to medium sized hybridization bottles (260 × 40 mm, Amersham Biosciences, catalog number RPN2516) containing the membrane arrays prehybridized in 20 ml of CHURCH buffer for 30 min in a rotary hybridization oven. Hybridization with the 33P-labeled cDNA was for 16 h at 65 °C. After hybridization the hybridization buffer was discarded and replaced by 150 ml of washing buffer: the membranes were washed once in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, twice in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and once in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min each at 65 °C. The membranes were transferred to a sheet of 3MM paper, immediately wrapped in Saran wrap, exposed to intensifying screens for 48 h, and scanned with a PhosphorImager at 200-micron resolution (Storm 820, AmershamBiosciences). Images were subsequently analyzed with ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences) and converted into a table of signal intensities. Further data analysis was performed using Excel (Microsoft). For normalization between samples data were corrected for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase present in 18 copies on each filter. A detailed laboratory protocol for the cDNA array method described here is available on request from the Schlaak ([email protected]) or Kerr ([email protected]) labs. RPAs were carried out as described previously (27Muller M. Laxton C. Briscoe J. Schindler C. Improta T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4221-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Briefly, probes were synthesized from SP6/T7 transcription vectors and labeled with [32P]UTP to a specific activity of 2–5 × 108 cpm/μg of input DNA. Aliquots equivalent to 1–3 × 105 cpm of each probe and 13 μg of total RNA were used per assay. The intensities of radioactive bands were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Storm,Amersham Biosciences). Bands of interest were quantitated and corrected for background. Data are expressed as -fold induction compared with unstimulated samples. Statistical analysis was performed using the two-sample Wilcoxon test. Here we have developed a customized cDNA array methodology for ISGs based on nylon filter technology. At present this system permits the analysis of between 288 (triplicate spot) and 864 genes (single spot) for up to 12 samples per day (Fig.1 A). Throughout the duration of the experiments it was constantly extended from 150 to 231 genes. The analysis presented here, however, is restricted to the initial 150 genes (Table I). A substantial spectrum of known ISGs can be assayed with this macroarray (“macro”array: spot size >300 μm; “micro”array: spot size <300 μm) and it allows the convenient investigation of complex experimental settings including, for example, extensive kinetic and dose-response curves. Moreover the processing, analysis, storage, and recovery of the data is significantly easier and quicker compared with that for microarrays, because only genes of interest are investigated. Accordingly, the analysis of the data for 12 arrays takes ∼60–90 min using standard Microsoft Excel software. Currently, each cDNA is spotted in triplicate (mean coefficient of variation for triplicates: 6–8%) to yield maximal reproducibility and sensitivity (Fig. 1 B). The high flexibility of the spotting procedure also permits the generation of filters with only one spot per gene that are particularly useful for scanning higher numbers of target genes with lower sensitivity. To enhance the performance of the system it is critical to block nonspecific hybridization through repetitive sequences or the poly(A) tail using COT1-DNA and poly(dA) (Fig.2). This is particularly useful for genes only marginally (1.5–2.5-fold) induced: differentials for highly induced genes are still detectable in the absence of prehybridization with COT1-DNA and poly(dA). The system offers a high degree of reproducibility as indicated by its low inter- and intra-assay variation (Fig. 3, A andB, Supplementary Materials for TableII, Table IV, experiment TC V/a-d). To achieve this it is essential to use strict endotoxin-free culture conditions because lipopolysaccharide can induce IFN-β and the expression of ISGs (28Navarro L. David M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35535-35538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). 2J. F. Schlaak, unpublished data. For RNA extraction, to avoid artifacts induced by prolonged trypsinization and centrifugation, adherent cells were lysed directly on the tissue culture plates and suspension cells directly after spinning down without washing.Figure 3Assay variation. A, intra-assay variation. Two independent samples of total RNA were extracted from 10-cm dishes of unstimulated HT1080 cells, reverse transcribed into labeled cDNA, and hybridized to target cDNA spotted onto nylon membranes. In this scatter plot analysis data are shown as absolute intensity values for each gene. B, inter-assay variation. HT1080 cells were stimulated in two independent experiments with 1000 units/ml IFN-α2a for 8 h. Total RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed into labeled cDNA, and hybridized to target cDNA spotted onto nylon membranes.

Comparability of the macroarray data for known genes with data obtained by alternative accepted RNase protection methodology was established by data from experiments carried out as an integral part of our ongoing program.

Similarly good correlations have been obtained in a number of further experiments comparing the results by the two methods for the above and additional ISGs including IP-10, GBP-1, 6-16, MxA and 2–5OAS (for example, Fig. 7, TableV). 3C.

As a rule of thumb, in most micro- and macroarray systems a 2-fold change in the expression level is regarded as being significant. Statistical analysis showed that the macroarrays are capable of detecting smaller differences, after stimulation with very low concentrations of IFN-α (e.g. 10 IU/ml, Fig. 5), changes in gene expression of 30% or less are detectable with a high degree of significance (p value < 0.05) by this method. This permits the analysis of dose-response curves for poorly induced (<2-fold, Fig. 6) genes considered marginally significant by other methods. Using more replicates of the spotted DNA this high sensitivity may be enhanced even further. The physiological relevance of these relatively small changes, however, still have to be determined for the individual genes. Accordingly, we have retained 2-fold as the threshold level for significant inducibility for comparative expression profiling (TablesTable II, Table III, Table IV), which is, in addition, associated with a very high degree of statistical significance (p = 0.001 and less, Fig.5).Figure 6Dose-response curves for “marginally induced” genes.

Chk2 from unstressed human cells is largely monomeric and inactive in phosphorylating its substrate, Cdc25C. It is also unphosphorylated at Thr-68, a site that is the target of the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated protein kinase. After treatment of HCT116 cells with a radiomimetic compound neocarzinostatin, active Chk2 exists as stable Thr-68-phosphorylated dimers as well as interconvertable Thr-68-unphosphorylated monomers and dimers. Interestingly, Chk2 from insect cells behaves by all criteria tested like active Chk2 from neocarzinostatin-treated HCT116 cells. Based on Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient values, Chk2 monomers and dimers have asymmetric rather than globular shapes. Both Thr-68-phosphorylated and Thr-68-unphosphorylated forms of active Chk2 are capable of phosphorylating Cdc25C. Thus, although phosphorylation of Thr-68 may be required for initial oligomerization and activation of Chk2, it is not needed for maintenance of dimerization or kinase activity.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 877-886Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Cdc25A by Chk2 prevents it from activating Cdk2, which plays an essential role in G1 to S transition (9Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Google Scholar). In a similar manner, Chk2 phosphorylation of Cdc25C interferes with activation of Cdk1 activity thus resulting in G2/M cell cycle arrest (5Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Google Scholar,7Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Schwarz J.K. Mitiku N. Piwnica-Worms H. Chung J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has also been shown that Chk2 can phosphorylate p53 in a DNA damage-dependent manner (11Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Crossref Google Scholar, 12Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref Google Scholar), and mouse cells lacking Chk2 are defective in signaling to p53 after DNA damage (13Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Google Scholar). However, cell cycle regulation via the Chk2-p53-dependent pathway has been recently questioned (14Jack M.T. Woo R.A. Hirao A. Cheung A. Mak T.W. Lee P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9825-9829Google Scholar). Chk2 can also phosphorylate the C terminus of BRCA1 (15Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Google Scholar) although the significance of phosphorylation of BRCA1 in DNA repair is not well understood.The 543-amino acid human Chk2 (hChk2) protein contains three domains including a SQ/TQ cluster domain (SCD) at the N terminus (residues 19–69), a forkhead homology-associated (FHA) domain within the central portion (residues 115–175), and a kinase domain within the C-terminal region (residues 226–486). Direct phosphorylation of Chk2 by ATM at Thr-68 within the SCD is required for activation and is also a likely priming event for subsequent phosphorylation at other hChk2 sites (16Ahn J.Y. Schwarz J.K. Piwnica-Worms H. Canman C.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5934-5936Google Scholar, 17Melchionna R. Chen X.B. Blasina A. McGowan C.H. Nat.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Google Scholar). A tumor-derived Chk2 mutation within the FHA domain, R145W, renders the protein incapable of being phosphorylated in an ATM-dependent manner, suggesting that the FHA domain is involved in activation of the protein (19Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Google Scholar, 20Wu X. Webster S.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2971-2974Google Scholar). Despite many studies showing that FHA domains are phosphopeptide recognition motifs (21Durocher D. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 387-394Google Scholar, 22Liao H. Byeon I.J.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1169-1182Google Scholar), progress in identification of proteins interacting with FHA domains has been limited. It was shown that a phosphorylated receptor-like kinase interacts with the FHA domain of Arabidopsis thaliana phosphatase (25Stone J.M. Collinge M.A. Smith R.D. Horn M.A. Walker J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 793-795Google Scholar, 26Li J. Smith G.P. Walker J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7821-7826Google Scholar). Another protein,Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad53, a homolog of human Chk2, which contains two FHA domains, was also shown to interact with phosphorylated Rad9 in a DNA damage-dependent manner (27Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Google Scholar). Recently, Ahn et al. (28Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19389-19395Google Scholar) demonstrated that synthetic hChk2 peptides spanning Thr-68 interact with isolated hChk2 FHA domains in a Thr-68 phosphorylation-dependent manner. They reported as well that the dimers formed are transient in nature during activation and that active Thr-68-phosphorylated hChk2 protein exists as a monomer. In another study Xu et al. (29Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar) show that both the SCD and the FHA domains are required for formation of Chk2 oligomers, and they concluded that Chk2 phosphorylation is required for stable dimerization. Here we report the isolation of highly purified forms of Chk2 protein and show that Chk2 is an unusually shaped non-globular protein. Chk2 monomers that are unphosphorylated at Thr-68 can be isolated from either untreated or DNA-damaged cells, whereas Thr-68-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Chk2 dimers form only in DNA-damaged cells. Interestingly, both Thr-68-phosphorylated dimers and unphosphorylated Chk2 existing as interconvertable dimer-monomer forms are similarly active as kinases toward Cdc25C. We propose a model for activation and oligomerization of Chk2 upon DNA damage to cells.DISCUSSIONAlthough aspects of Chk2 structure and function have been described, there are still many gaps in our understanding of its biochemical properties. In this study we examined some of the characteristics of human Chk2 purified from insect and human cells. The experiments yielded several findings. First, unstressed cells produce only inactive Thr-68-unphosphorylated monomers. Second, upon DNA damage, Chk2 comprises stable Thr-68-phosphorylated dimers as well as Thr-68-unphosphorylated Chk2 dimers that can exist in a state of dynamic equilibrium with monomers. Third, Thr-68 phosphorylation is not required for maintenance of Chk2 kinase activity. Our data taken together suggest a model by which Chk2 phosphorylation at Thr-68 is a priming event for subsequent events leading to activation of the protein but that maintenance of phosphorylation at that site is not required for dimerization or activity (Fig. 7). It is acknowledged that our data to support the latter hypothesis rest partly on experiments using Chk2 isolated from insect cells and that further confirmation awaits the ability to isolate non-Thr-68-phosphorylated Chk2 dimers from DNA-damaged human cells. Nevertheless all of our data indicate that insect cell-derived Chk2 is virtually identical to that from DNA-damaged human cells.Wu et al. (20Wu X. Webster S.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2971-2974Google Scholar) report that wild-type Chk2 mainly exists as a protein complex of ∼200 kDa in human cells. They speculated that this complex might contain other cellular proteins. Based upon their results, our initial goal was to identify the components of the protein complex. However, when we characterized and compared the biochemical and biophysical properties of recombinant Chk2 purified from both baculovirus-infected insect cells and mammalian cells, it became evident that highly purified Chk2 exists as monomers and homodimers. Gel filtration and sedimentation analyses of the protein suggest that it has a rather unusual shape and that the ∼200-kDa protein complex is the dimeric form of Chk2. Chk2 is not terribly unique in possessing a non-globular shape; a sample of asymmetric proteins include p53 (35Friedman P.N. Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3319-3323Google Scholar), calreticulin (36Bouvier M. Stafford W.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14950-14959Google Scholar), and the HSC70 co-chaperone, HIP (37Velten M. Gomez-Vrielynck N. Chaffotte A. Ladjimi M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 259-266Google Scholar), among others.Highly purified HA-Chk2 proteins from human cells after treatment with NCS also consist of homodimers and monomers. There did not appear to be detectable quantities of larger forms of Chk2. This suggests that there is no highly stable interaction between Chk2 and other cellular factors as a result of DNA damage. We cannot rule out transient or weak interaction between such proteins, however, which would not be sustained in our immunoaffinity purification. The recombinant Chk2 FHA domain was found to interact with BRCA1 in both phosphorylation-dependent and -independent manners (15Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Google Scholar,38Li J. Williams B.L. Haire L.F. Goldberg M. Wilker E. Durocher D. Yaffe M.B. Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1045-1054Google Scholar). BRCA1 is a part of BASC, a supercomplex of a BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex comprised of tumor suppressors, DNA damage repair proteins, and DNA replication factors (39Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Google Scholar). Therefore, Chk2 may well participate in huge macromolecular complexes. In fact Wardet al. (40Ward I.M. Wu X. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47755-47758Google Scholar) report that Thr-68-phosphorylated Chk2 is localized to sites of DNA strand breaks after ionizing radiation. The interacting partner(s) of Chk2 in such conditions have yet to be identified.There are some differences between what we have observed and others have reported regarding Chk2 dimerization. Ahn et al. (28Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19389-19395Google Scholar) report that Chk2 was activated through transient dimerization after phosphorylation at Thr-68 after DNA damage to cells. They were not able to observe a stable interaction between two wild-type Chk2 proteins differentially epitope-tagged at the N terminus by immunoprecipitation from transiently transfected mammalian cells after ionizing radiation. However, they obtained stable complexes of catalytic inactive mutant and wild-type Chk2 independently of ionizing radiation to the cells, leading them to propose that Chk2 exists as an active monomer that is phosphorylated at Thr-68 as a response to DNA damage in cells. On the other hand, Xu et al. (29Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar) report that two wild-type Chk2 constructs differentially tagged at their N termini could form a stable complex using similar conditions to those of Ahn et al.(28Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19389-19395Google Scholar). Xu et al. (29Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar) also observed dimerization of Chk2 in the absence of ionizing radiation with a concomitant increase in dimerization and phosphorylation of the SCD domain after DNA damage. Both groups proposed that homooligomerization of the proteins arises from the intermolecular interaction between the phosphorylated SCD domain of one Chk2 molecule and the FHA domain of the other molecule. By contrast, neither Wu et al. (20Wu X. Webster S.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2971-2974Google Scholar) nor ourselves was able to detect interactions between endogenous Chk2 and HA-Chk2 from HCT116 cells by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody. Our results strongly suggest that the anti-HA antibody, when bound to the N-terminal HA epitope, interferes with the intermolecular interaction between the SCD domain and the FHA domain probably by steric hindrance. A possible explanation for the differences in our results and those of Xu et al. (29Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar) was that their Chk2 construct had multiple tandem epitopes that could result in antibody binding at the extreme N terminus without perturbing the SCD-FHA domain interaction. Additionally, a possible explanation as to why other groups observed oligomerization even without having irradiated cells is because they used transient transfection to overexpress Chk2 proteins, and this process has been shown to cause stress to cells that is akin to DNA damage and activate a DNA damage response pathway (41Renzing J. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1865-1868Google Scholar, 42Rodriguez A. Flemington E.K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 171-181Google Scholar). We have not tested whether the process of transfection of HCT116 cells would yield dimeric Thr-68-phosphorylated Chk2.In the SCD domain of Chk2 are seven SQ/TQ sites. Thr-68 phosphorylation is the presumed priming event that activates the protein upon DNA damage to cells (16Ahn J.Y. Schwarz J.K. Piwnica-Worms H. Canman C.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5934-5936Google Scholar, 17Melchionna R. Chen X.B. Blasina A. McGowan C.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Google Scholar, 18Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Google Scholar, 19Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Google Scholar). We observed the most stable forms of dimers are phosphorylated at Thr-68. Interestingly, our results showed that active forms of Chk2 protein lacking Thr-68 phosphorylation still formed dimers, although the interaction is not stable as judged by their elution profile from gel filtration chromatography and resistance to chemical cross-linking. Xu et al. (29Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar) also show that a mutant form of Chk2 (T68A) forms dimers but to a lesser extent than wild-type proteins. Because the mutant protein used in our study is defective in autophosphorylation, Thr-68 phosphorylation-independent dimerization cannot be due to autophosphorylation during activation of kinase domain. Secondary dimerization determinants may be other phosphorylation sites in the SCD domain. The existence of Chk2 protein from DNA-damaged cells that is not phosphorylated at Thr-68 implies that such proteins arise from dimers from which phosphorylation at Thr-68 has been removed but which retain phosphates necessary and sufficient for activation of the kinase activity.Our results pose a number of questions. 1) If secondary dimerization is due to phosphorylation at other sites, is it mediated by ATM or other unknown kinases? 2) What is the activity that selectively removes phosphate from Thr-68 after DNA damage? 3) If both monomer and dimer forms of Chk2 are active in DNA-damaged cells, what are their respective purposes? Answers to these questions will provide the impetus for future work on this interesting checkpoint kinase. In cells the DNA damage checkpoint pathway exists to prevent transmission of altered genetic information to progeny.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 877-886Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Cdc25A by Chk2 prevents it from activating Cdk2, which plays an essential role in G1 to S transition (9Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Google Scholar). In a similar manner, Chk2 phosphorylation of Cdc25C interferes with activation of Cdk1 activity thus resulting in G2/M cell cycle arrest (5Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Google Scholar,7Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Schwarz J.K. Mitiku N. Piwnica-Worms H. Chung J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has also been shown that Chk2 can phosphorylate p53 in a DNA damage-dependent manner (11Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Crossref Google Scholar, 12Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref Google Scholar), and mouse cells lacking Chk2 are defective in signaling to p53 after DNA damage (13Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Google Scholar). However, cell cycle regulation via the Chk2-p53-dependent pathway has been recently questioned (14Jack M.T. Woo R.A. Hirao A. Cheung A. Mak T.W. Lee P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9825-9829Google Scholar). Chk2 can also phosphorylate the C terminus of BRCA1 (15Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Google Scholar) although the significance of phosphorylation of BRCA1 in DNA repair is not well understood. The 543-amino acid human Chk2 (hChk2) protein contains three domains including a SQ/TQ cluster domain (SCD) at the N terminus (residues 19–69), a forkhead homology-associated (FHA) domain within the central portion (residues 115–175), and a kinase domain within the C-terminal region (residues 226–486). Direct phosphorylation of Chk2 by ATM at Thr-68 within the SCD is required for activation and is also a likely priming event for subsequent phosphorylation at other hChk2 sites (16Ahn J.Y. Schwarz J.K. Piwnica-Worms H. Canman C.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5934-5936Google Scholar, 17Melchionna R. Chen X.B. Blasina A. McGowan C.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Google Scholar, 18Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Google Scholar, 19Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Google Scholar). A tumor-derived Chk2 mutation within the FHA domain, R145W, renders the protein incapable of being phosphorylated in an ATM-dependent manner, suggesting that the FHA domain is involved in activation of the protein (19Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Google Scholar, 20Wu X. Webster S.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2971-2974Google Scholar). Despite many studies showing that FHA domains are phosphopeptide recognition motifs (21Durocher D. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 387-394Google Scholar, 22Liao H. Byeon I.J.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1169-1182Google Scholar), progress in identification of proteins interacting with FHA domains has been limited. It was shown that a phosphorylated receptor-like kinase interacts with the FHA domain of Arabidopsis thaliana phosphatase (25Stone J.M. Collinge M.A. Smith R.D. Horn M.A. Walker J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 793-795Google Scholar, 26Li J. Smith G.P. Walker J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7821-7826Google Scholar). Another protein,Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad53, a homolog of human Chk2, which contains two FHA domains, was also shown to interact with phosphorylated Rad9 in a DNA damage-dependent manner (27Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Google Scholar). Recently, Ahn et al. (28Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19389-19395Google Scholar) demonstrated that synthetic hChk2 peptides spanning Thr-68 interact with isolated hChk2 FHA domains in a Thr-68 phosphorylation-dependent manner. They reported as well that the dimers formed are transient in nature during activation and that active Thr-68-phosphorylated hChk2 protein exists as a monomer. In another study Xu et al. (29Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar) show that both the SCD and the FHA domains are required for formation of Chk2 oligomers, and they concluded that Chk2 phosphorylation is required for stable dimerization. Here we report the isolation of highly purified forms of Chk2 protein and show that Chk2 is an unusually shaped non-globular protein. Chk2 monomers that are unphosphorylated at Thr-68 can be isolated from either untreated or DNA-damaged cells, whereas Thr-68-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Chk2 dimers form only in DNA-damaged cells. Interestingly, both Thr-68-phosphorylated dimers and unphosphorylated Chk2 existing as interconvertable dimer-monomer forms are similarly active as kinases toward Cdc25C. We propose a model for activation and oligomerization of Chk2 upon DNA damage to cells. DISCUSSIONAlthough aspects of Chk2 structure and function have been described, there are still many gaps in our understanding of its biochemical properties. In this study we examined some of the characteristics of human Chk2 purified from insect and human cells. The experiments yielded several findings. First, unstressed cells produce only inactive Thr-68-unphosphorylated monomers. Second, upon DNA damage, Chk2 comprises stable Thr-68-phosphorylated dimers as well as Thr-68-unphosphorylated Chk2 dimers that can exist in a state of dynamic equilibrium with monomers. Third, Thr-68 phosphorylation is not required for maintenance of Chk2 kinase activity. Our data taken together suggest a model by which Chk2 phosphorylation at Thr-68 is a priming event for subsequent events leading to activation of the protein but that maintenance of phosphorylation at that site is not required for dimerization or activity (Fig. 7). It is acknowledged that our data to support the latter hypothesis rest partly on experiments using Chk2 isolated from insect cells and that further confirmation awaits the ability to isolate non-Thr-68-phosphorylated Chk2 dimers from DNA-damaged human cells. Nevertheless all of our data indicate that insect cell-derived Chk2 is virtually identical to that from DNA-damaged human cells.Wu et al. (20Wu X. Webster S.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2971-2974Google Scholar) report that wild-type Chk2 mainly exists as a protein complex of ∼200 kDa in human cells. They speculated that this complex might contain other cellular proteins. Based upon their results, our initial goal was to identify the components of the protein complex. However, when we characterized and compared the biochemical and biophysical properties of recombinant Chk2 purified from both baculovirus-infected insect cells and mammalian cells, it became evident that highly purified Chk2 exists as monomers and homodimers. Gel filtration and sedimentation analyses of the protein suggest that it has a rather unusual shape and that the ∼200-kDa protein complex is the dimeric form of Chk2. Chk2 is not terribly unique in possessing a non-globular shape; a sample of asymmetric proteins include p53 (35Friedman P.N. Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3319-3323Google Scholar), calreticulin (36Bouvier M. Stafford W.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14950-14959Google Scholar), and the HSC70 co-chaperone, HIP (37Velten M. Gomez-Vrielynck N. Chaffotte A. Ladjimi M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 259-266Google Scholar), among others.Highly purified HA-Chk2 proteins from human cells after treatment with NCS also consist of homodimers and monomers. There did not appear to be detectable quantities of larger forms of Chk2. This suggests that there is no highly stable interaction between Chk2 and other cellular factors as a result of DNA damage. We cannot rule out transient or weak interaction between such proteins, however, which would not be sustained in our immunoaffinity purification. The recombinant Chk2 FHA domain was found to interact with BRCA1 in both phosphorylation-dependent and -independent manners (15Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Google Scholar,38Li J. Williams B.L. Haire L.F. Goldberg M. Wilker E. Durocher D. Yaffe M.B. Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1045-1054Google Scholar). BRCA1 is a part of BASC, a supercomplex of a BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex comprised of tumor suppressors, DNA damage repair proteins, and DNA replication factors (39Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Google Scholar). Therefore, Chk2 may well participate in huge macromolecular complexes. In fact Wardet al. (40Ward I.M. Wu X. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47755-47758Google Scholar) report that Thr-68-phosphorylated Chk2 is localized to sites of DNA strand breaks after ionizing radiation. The interacting partner(s) of Chk2 in such conditions have yet to be identified.There are some differences between what we have observed and others have reported regarding Chk2 dimerization. Ahn et al. (28Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19389-19395Google Scholar) report that Chk2 was activated through transient dimerization after phosphorylation at Thr-68 after DNA damage to cells. They were not able to observe a stable interaction between two wild-type Chk2 proteins differentially epitope-tagged at the N terminus by immunoprecipitation from transiently transfected mammalian cells after ionizing radiation. However, they obtained stable complexes of catalytic inactive mutant and wild-type Chk2 independently of ionizing radiation to the cells, leading them to propose that Chk2 exists as an active monomer that is phosphorylated at Thr-68 as a response to DNA damage in cells. On the other hand, Xu et al. (29Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar) report that two wild-type Chk2 constructs differentially tagged at their N termini could form a stable complex using similar conditions to those of Ahn et al.(28Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19389-19395Google Scholar). Xu et al. (29Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar) also observed dimerization of Chk2 in the absence of ionizing radiation with a concomitant increase in dimerization and phosphorylation of the SCD domain after DNA damage. Both groups proposed that homooligomerization of the proteins arises from the intermolecular interaction between the phosphorylated SCD domain of one Chk2 molecule and the FHA domain of the other molecule. By contrast, neither Wu et al. (20Wu X. Webster S.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2971-2974Google Scholar) nor ourselves was able to detect interactions between endogenous Chk2 and HA-Chk2 from HCT116 cells by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody. Our results strongly suggest that the anti-HA antibody, when bound to the N-terminal HA epitope, interferes with the intermolecular interaction between the SCD domain and the FHA domain probably by steric hindrance. A possible explanation for the differences in our results and those of Xu et al. (29Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar) was that their Chk2 construct had multiple tandem epitopes that could result in antibody binding at the extreme N terminus without perturbing the SCD-FHA domain interaction. Additionally, a possible explanation as to why other groups observed oligomerization even without having irradiated cells is because they used transient transfection to overexpress Chk2 proteins, and this process has been shown to cause stress to cells that is akin to DNA damage and activate a DNA damage response pathway (41Renzing J. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1865-1868Google Scholar, 42Rodriguez A. Flemington E.K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 171-181Google Scholar). We have not tested whether the process of transfection of HCT116 cells would yield dimeric Thr-68-phosphorylated Chk2.In the SCD domain of Chk2 are seven SQ/TQ sites. Thr-68 phosphorylation is the presumed priming event that activates the protein upon DNA damage to cells (16Ahn J.Y. Schwarz J.K. Piwnica-Worms H. Canman C.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5934-5936Google Scholar, 17Melchionna R. Chen X.B. Blasina A. McGowan C.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Google Scholar, 18Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Google Scholar, 19Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Google Scholar). We observed the most stable forms of dimers are phosphorylated at Thr-68. Interestingly, our results showed that active forms of Chk2 protein lacking Thr-68 phosphorylation still formed dimers, although the interaction is not stable as judged by their elution profile from gel filtration chromatography and resistance to chemical cross-linking. Xu et al. (29Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar) also show that a mutant form of Chk2 (T68A) forms dimers but to a lesser extent than wild-type proteins. Because the mutant protein used in our study is defective in autophosphorylation, Thr-68 phosphorylation-independent dimerization cannot be due to autophosphorylation during activation of kinase domain. Secondary dimerization determinants may be other phosphorylation sites in the SCD domain. The existence of Chk2 protein from DNA-damaged cells that is not phosphorylated at Thr-68 implies that such proteins arise from dimers from which phosphorylation at Thr-68 has been removed but which retain phosphates necessary and sufficient for activation of the kinase activity.Our results pose a number of questions. 1) If secondary dimerization is due to phosphorylation at other sites, is it mediated by ATM or other unknown kinases? 2) What is the activity that selectively removes phosphate from Thr-68 after DNA damage? 3) If both monomer and dimer forms of Chk2 are active in DNA-damaged cells, what are their respective purposes? Answers to these questions will provide the impetus for future work on this interesting checkpoint kinase. Although aspects of Chk2 structure and function have been described, there are still many gaps in our understanding of its biochemical properties.

Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar) also show that a mutant form of Chk2 (T68A) forms dimers but to a lesser extent than wild-type proteins. Because the mutant protein used in our study is defective in autophosphorylation, Thr-68 phosphorylation-independent dimerization cannot be due to autophosphorylation during activation of kinase domain. Secondary dimerization determinants may be other phosphorylation sites in the SCD domain. The existence of Chk2 protein from DNA-damaged cells that is not phosphorylated at Thr-68 implies that such proteins arise from dimers from which phosphorylation at Thr-68 has been removed but which retain phosphates necessary and sufficient for activation of the kinase activity. Our results pose a number of questions. 1) If secondary dimerization is due to phosphorylation at other sites, is it mediated by ATM or other unknown kinases? 2) What is the activity that selectively removes phosphate from Thr-68 after DNA damage? 3) If both monomer and dimer forms of Chk2 are active in DNA-damaged cells, what are their respective purposes? Answers to these questions will provide the impetus for future work on this interesting checkpoint kinase. We thank Ella Freulich and Juyun Kim for excellent technical assistance."

This in vivo activity correlates with the ability of maspin to inhibit cell migrationin vitro. This behavior suggests that maspin inhibits matrix-degrading proteases, such as those of the plasminogen activation system, in a similar manner to the serpin PAI-1. However, there is controversy concerning the protease inhibitory activity of maspin. It is devoid of activity against a wide range of proteases, in common with other non-inhibitory serpins, but has recently been reported to inhibit plasminogen activators associated with cells and other biological surfaces (Sheng, S. J., Truong, B., Fredrickson, D., Wu, R. L., Pardee, A. B., and Sager, R. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 499–504; McGowen, R., Biliran, H., Jr., Sager, R., and Sheng, S. (2000) Cancer Res. 60, 4771–4778). We have compared the effects of maspin with those of PAI-1 in a range of situations in which plasminogen activation is potentiated, reflecting the biological context of this proteolytic system: urokinase-type plasminogen activator bound to its receptor on the surface of tumor cells, tissue-type plasminogen activator specifically bound to vascular smooth muscle cells, fibrin, and the prion protein. Maspin was found to have no inhibitory effect in any of these situations, in contrast to the efficient inhibition observed with PAI-1, but nevertheless maspin inhibited the migration of both tumor and vascular smooth muscle cells. We conclude that maspin is a non-inhibitory serpin and that protease inhibition does not account for its activity as a tumor suppressor.

We conclude that maspin is a non-inhibitory serpin and that protease inhibition does not account for its activity as a tumor suppressor. Proteolytic activity is a key event in cell migration and invasion, being required to dynamically modulate interactions between the cell and its surrounding extracellular matrix (1Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Google Scholar). Multiple protease systems are implicated in this process, including the serine proteases of the plasminogen activation system (2Ellis V. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 1-5Google Scholar). In the pericellular environment the activity of this system is regulated by binding of the proteases or their zymogens to specific cell-surface receptors or binding sites. The plasminogen activator uPA 1The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; uPAR, cellular receptor for uPA; tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; RSL, reactive-site loop; PrP, prion protein; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells; AMC, amido-4-methylcoumarin; α1-PI, α1-proteinase inhibitor; S, stressed; R, relaxed binds to uPAR, a well characterized glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein (3Ploug M. Ellis V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 163-168Google Scholar); tPA binds to cell-surface proteins on cell types including endothelial (4Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Google Scholar) and VSMC (5Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2312-2322Google Scholar, 6Werner F. Razzaq T.M. Ellis V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21555-21561Google Scholar); and plasminogen binds to multiple cell-surface molecules (7Hawley S.B. Green M.A. Miles L.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 882-890Google Scholar). These interactions lead to assembly of complexes on the cell surface that greatly increase plasmin generation (5Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2312-2322Google Scholar, 8Ellis V. Behrendt N. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12752-12758Google Scholar, 9Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Werner F. Deadman J.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 651-659Google Scholar). The activity of tPA is also potentiated by binding to protein cofactors, including fibrin (10Hoylaerts M. Rijken D.C. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2912-2919Google Scholar) and PrP (11Ellis V. Daniels M. Misra R. Brown D.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6891-6896Google Scholar). This powerful proteolytic system is inhibited by members of the serpin (serine protease inhibitor) family, in particular PAI-1 (SERPINE1), which can inhibit free, cofactor-bound and cell-associated plasminogen activators (6Werner F. Razzaq T.M. Ellis V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21555-21561Google Scholar, 12Ellis V. Wun T.-C. Behrendt N. Rønne E. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9904-9908Google Scholar). The protease inhibitory activity of PAI-1 has been shown to be of importancein vivo, inhibiting VSMC migration (13Carmeliet P. Moons L. Lijnen R. Janssens S. Lupu F. Collen D. Gerard R.D. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3180-3191Google Scholar) and regulating tumor angiogenesis (14Bajou K. Masson V. Gerard R.D. Schmitt P.M. Albert V. Praus M. Lund L.R. Frandsen T.L. Brunner N. Dano K. Fusenig N.E. Weidle U. Carmeliet G. Loskutoff D. Collen D. Carmeliet P. Foidart J.M. Noel A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 777-784Google Scholar), and its expression correlates with disease progression and prognosis in human cancers (15Duffy M.J. Clin. Chem. 2002; 48: 1194-1197Google Scholar). Some serpins have biological activities independent of protease inhibition. For example, PAI-1 binds to vitronectin, modulating cell adhesion and migration (16Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Google Scholar). Other serpins lack intrinsic inhibitory activity. Examples of this are ovalbumin, thyroid-binding globulin (SERPINA6), angiotensinogen (SERPINA8), and pigment epithelium-derived factor (SERPINF1), which has neurotrophic and anti-angiogenic activity (17Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G. Irving J.A. Lomas D.A. Luke C.J. Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Salvesen G.S. Travis J. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33293-33296Google Scholar, 18Dawson D.W. Volpert O.V. Gillis P. Crawford S.E. Xu H. Benedict W. Bouck N.P. Science. 1999; 285: 245-248Google Scholar). Maspin (SERPINB5) is thought to be another non-inhibitory serpin. Maspin was first identified as a class II tumor suppressor in human breast cancer (19Zou Z. Anisowicz A. Hendrix M.J. Thor A. Neveu M. Sheng S. Rafidi K. Seftor E. Sager R. Science. 1994; 263: 526-529Google Scholar), and transfection of maspin into carcinoma cells reduces their metastatic potential in vivo (19Zou Z. Anisowicz A. Hendrix M.J. Thor A. Neveu M. Sheng S. Rafidi K. Seftor E. Sager R. Science. 1994; 263: 526-529Google Scholar, 20Shi H.Y. Zhang W. Liang R. Abraham S. Kittrell F.S. Medina D. Zhang M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6945-6951Google Scholar). It is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, but is also secreted to the cell surface (21Pemberton P.A. Tipton A.R. Pavloff N. Smith J. Erickson J.R. Mouchabeck Z.M. Kiefer M.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1697-1706Google Scholar), where it has been shown to reduce the migration of various cell types in vitro (22Sheng S. Pemberton P.A. Sager R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30988-30993Google Scholar, 23Sheng S. Carey J. Seftor E.A. Dias L. Hendrix M.J. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11669-11674Google Scholar) and to inhibit angiogenesis in both in vitro and in vivo models (24Zhang M. Volpert O. Shi Y.H. Bouck N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 196-199Google Scholar). These activities of maspin are consistent with those of a protease inhibitor, yet extensive biochemical characterization has failed to demonstrate a protease target for maspin, and it lacks key features of inhibitory serpins (25Pemberton P.A. Wong D.T. Gibson H.L. Kiefer M.C. Fitzpatrick P.A. Sager R. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15832-15837Google Scholar). Therefore the mechanisms underlying its biological activities are considered to be largely unresolved (26Hendrix M.J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 374-376Google Scholar). However, recent studies have suggested that maspin does exhibit inhibitory activity toward the plasminogen activators uPA and tPA, but only when these proteases are bound to macromolecular cofactors, that is tPA bound to fibrin (27Sheng S.J. Truong B. Fredrickson D. Wu R.L. Pardee A.B. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 499-504Google Scholar) and uPA on the cell surface (28McGowen R. Biliran Jr., H. Sager R. Sheng S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4771-4778Google Scholar, 29Biliran Jr., H. Sheng S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8676-8682Google Scholar). Using techniques that we have previously established to investigate the activity and inhibition of cell-surface plasminogen activators, we demonstrate here that maspin has no inhibitory activity against these protease in either cellular environments or other situations in which their activities are potentiated and that reflect the biological context of this proteolytic system. Nevertheless, maspin was able to inhibit cell migration, strongly suggesting that this activity of maspin is not dependent on protease inhibition. Recombinant maspin expressed inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (25Pemberton P.A. Wong D.T. Gibson H.L. Kiefer M.C. Fitzpatrick P.A. Sager R. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15832-15837Google Scholar) was obtained from Andy Robertson (Department of Biochemistry, University of Iowa). tPA (Actilyse) was obtained from Boehringer-Ingleheim (Ingleheim, Germany). Recombinant PAI-1 was obtained from Calbiochem and its concentration determined by titration against tPA (6Werner F. Razzaq T.M. Ellis V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21555-21561Google Scholar). Lys-plasminogen (i.e. with Lys77 as N terminus) was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (Swansea, UK). The soluble fibrin fragment preparation Desafib-X was obtained from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). Recombinant PrP was prepared as described previously (11Ellis V. Daniels M. Misra R. Brown D.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6891-6896Google Scholar). The fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080 and DU 145 prostate carcinoma cells were from ATCC, and VSMC of aortic origin were isolated and cultures as described previously (5Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2312-2322Google Scholar). Plasminogen activation by uPAR-bound uPA on the surface of HT-1080 and DU 145 cells was determined as described previously (8Ellis V. Behrendt N. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12752-12758Google Scholar). In brief, cells grown to confluence in 24-well plates were washed in phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound uPA and incubated at 37 °C with varying fixed concentrations of plasminogen (20–200 nm), the plasmin specific substrate H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-AMC (0.25 mm), and varying concentrations of maspin or PAI-1. Plasmin generated by endogenously bound uPA was measured continuously as change in fluorescence in a SpectraMAX Gemini microplate reader (Molecular Device, Sunnyvale, CA) at λ 360/440 nm. Plasmin concentration was determined as δF and plasmin generation represented as δF versus time. Second-order inhibition rate constants were calculated from inhibition curves according to (30Liu W. Tsou C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 870: 185-190Google Scholar), as described previously (6Werner F. Razzaq T.M. Ellis V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21555-21561Google Scholar, 12Ellis V. Wun T.-C. Behrendt N. Rønne E. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9904-9908Google Scholar). Plasminogen activation by tPA bound to VSMC was determined essentially as described previously (5Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2312-2322Google Scholar, 6Werner F. Razzaq T.M. Ellis V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21555-21561Google Scholar). In brief, cells grown to confluence in 24-well plates were incubated with tPA (10 nm) for 20 min at 37 °C, washed extensively to remove unbound tPA, and plasminogen activation determined as described above. In these experiments plasmin generation was represented as F versustime2. tPA-catalyzed plasminogen activation stimulated by fibrin was determined by incubation of tPA (1.5 nm), Lys-plasminogen (25 nm), and varying concentrations of fibrin fragments in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, 0.1 mNaCl, pH 7.4, containing H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-AMC (0.25 mm). In preliminary experiments the fibrin concentration giving maximal stimulation (∼250-fold) was determined and found to be 250 μg/ml. This concentration was used for all subsequent experiments. Varying concentrations of either maspin or PAI-1 were included in these experiments and inhibition of plasminogen activation determined as described above. Similar experiments were performed to determine the effect of PrP on tPA inhibition by maspin. Recombinant PrP in its divalent metal ion-free form (apo-PrP) was included, in place of fibrin, at an optimal concentration of 50 μg/ml leading to more than a 250-fold stimulation of plasmin generation (11Ellis V. Daniels M. Misra R. Brown D.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6891-6896Google Scholar). Cell migration was determined using time-lapse video microscopy. VSMC were seeded into four-well plates at a density of 7500 cells/ml/well in Medium 231 containing Smooth Muscle Cell Growth Supplement (Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR). After 24 h the medium was changed to L15 air-buffered medium (Sigma), 0.1% bovine serum albumin containing varying concentrations of maspin (0–200 nm). Cell movement was recorded by computerized time-lapse video microscopy (Nikon, Kingston upon Thames, UK) with images acquired every 5 min for 15 h. 10–20 cells were tracked per movie and cell movement quantified using Lucia 32G/Magic 4.11 software (Nikon) and expressed as micrometer/hour. The best characterized pericellular proteolytic system is the uPA/uPAR system, which specifically activates cell-associated plasminogen. We have previously shown that uPA bound to cellular uPAR is efficiently inhibited by PAI-1, with kinetics similar to those in solution (12Ellis V. Wun T.-C. Behrendt N. Rønne E. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9904-9908Google Scholar). Fig.1 A shows the inhibition of endogenous uPA on HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells. Increasing concentrations of PAI-1 (up to 20 nm) lead to a complete inhibition of uPA activity in a time-dependent manner, consistent with the standard serpin inhibitory mechanism. The calculated second-order inhibition rate constant, 4.1 × 106m−1 s−1, compares with 7.9 × 106m−1 s−1determined for uPA in solution. In sharp contrast to this, maspin at concentrations up to 200 nm completely failed to inhibit uPA activity (Fig.1 B). Decreasing the concentration of plasminogen in the experiment to greater than 10-fold below K m, to minimize possible competitive effects on the reaction with maspin, did not lead to an observable inhibitory effect. In the absence of cells, uPA bound to recombinant soluble uPAR was also not inhibited by maspin (data not shown). From these data in Fig. 1 B it can be estimated (assuming a minimum detection level of 5% inhibition) that the maximum value of the rate constant for uPA inhibition by maspin is ∼400 m−1 s−1, 4 orders of magnitude less than for inhibition by PAI-1. Experiments were also performed using DU 145 prostate carcinoma cells (as used in the study of McGowen et al. (28McGowen R. Biliran Jr., H. Sager R. Sheng S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4771-4778Google Scholar)), and a similar lack of inhibition by maspin was observed (data not shown). tPA is also known to associate with certain cell types, and we have shown that VSMC bind tPA and stimulate its activity more than 100-fold (5Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2312-2322Google Scholar, 6Werner F. Razzaq T.M. Ellis V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21555-21561Google Scholar). This involves a putative receptor-mediated mechanism analogous to the uPAR-dependent mechanism for the activation of cell-associated plasminogen. Fig. 1, C and D, show that tPA specifically bound to VSMC is efficiently inhibited by PAI-1, but again no inhibition was detectable at maspin concentrations of up to 200 nm. Plasmin generation at the highest maspin concentration was consistently increased, but was also observed with the non-inhibitory serpin ovalbumin (data not shown), suggesting an additional stimulation possibly by cleaved serpin. A similar effect has previously been observed (27Sheng S.J. Truong B. Fredrickson D. Wu R.L. Pardee A.B. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 499-504Google Scholar), and high concentrations of both maspin and ovalbumin led to a small stimulation of tPA activity in solution (data not shown). tPA activity is stimulated, in the absence of cells, by binding to fibrin. This involves the binding of tPA and plasminogen to fibrin as a catalytic “template” and direct effects on catalytic activity. In the presence of this very specific stimulatory mechanism, PAI-1 is still an effective inhibitor of tPA (Fig. 1 E), but maspin once again failed to manifest inhibitory activity. We have recently shown that certain conformations of PrP can enhance tPA-catalyzed plasminogen activation by greater than 300-fold by a template mechanism involving independent and specific interactions of PrP with plasminogen and tPA (11Ellis V. Daniels M. Misra R. Brown D.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6891-6896Google Scholar). Maspin was also unable to inhibit tPA activity in this environment (data not shown). Previous studies have correlated the inhibitory effects of maspin on cell migration to the inhibition of plasminogen activator activity (28McGowen R. Biliran Jr., H. Sager R. Sheng S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4771-4778Google Scholar, 29Biliran Jr., H. Sheng S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8676-8682Google Scholar). We have determined the effect of maspin on the migration of VSMC using time-lapse video microscopy. Fig. 2 shows that maspin inhibited VSMC migration in a biphasic manner, consistent with previous observations on other cell types (22Sheng S. Pemberton P.A. Sager R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30988-30993Google Scholar, 28McGowen R. Biliran Jr., H. Sager R. Sheng S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4771-4778Google Scholar). Migration of HT-1080 cells was also inhibited in a similar manner (data not shown). Interestingly, the time course of migration in the presence of maspin was linear (Fig. 2,inset), suggesting that maspin exerts an immediate inhibitory effect. These experiments both verify the biological activity of the maspin used in these experiments and more importantly demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of maspin on cell migration, thought to be intimately involved in its tumor suppressing activity, is not a consequence of protease inhibition. The activity of the plasminogen activation system is regulated by two opposing mechanisms: cell-surface-binding sites and protein cofactors, which facilitate productive catalytic interactions with plasminogen and thereby potentiate plasmin generation, and serpin inhibitors, which temporally and spatially restrict the activities of the proteases. These mechanisms have been shown to have a complex interplay in vivo, for example, in the regulation of angiogenesis (31Devy L. Blacher S. Grignet-Debrus C. Bajou K. Masson V. Gerard R.D. Gils A. Carmeliet G. Carmeliet P. Declerck P.J. Noel A. Foidart J.M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 147-154Google Scholar). The ability of maspin to inhibit cell migration and its tumor suppressing activity in vivo are consistent with the inhibition of pericellular proteases, particularly the plasminogen activators. However the data presented here show that in a wide variety of situations in which the functional activity of the plasminogen activation system is highly up-regulated, and in which PAI-1 is an extremely effective inhibitor, maspin has no detectable inhibitory effect. Despite this lack of protease inhibitory activity, maspin was nevertheless able to inhibit the migration of both VSMC and tumor cells in a biphasic manner consistent with previous reports (22Sheng S. Pemberton P.A. Sager R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30988-30993Google Scholar). Our observations are consistent with the molecular characteristics of maspin in relation to current knowledge of serpin mechanisms. This involves complex formation between protease and serpin and cleavage at the P1 residue of the reactive-site loop (RSL) followed by insertion of this loop into the major β-sheet as a new central strand and translocation of the protease to the opposite pole of the serpin leading to structural alterations in the now covalently bound protease (32Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 19: 923-926Google Scholar). This mechanism is critically dependent on a number of features of the serpin RSL, one being its length (32Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 19: 923-926Google Scholar, 33Zhou A. Carrell R.W. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27541-27547Google Scholar). In the far majority of inhibitory serpins the RSL has 17 residues (determined from the Glu residue of the proximal hinge region to the reactive-site P1 residue) and 16 residues in the remainder (Fig.3). Although a three-dimensional structure is not available for maspin, its sequence suggests that it has the shortest RSL of both the inhibitory and non-inhibitory serpins. Arg340 is the putative P1 residue in maspin, giving an RSL of just 13 residues. A potential alternative P1 residue for cleavage by serine proteases with trypsin-like specificity is Lys345, which would give an 18-residue RSL. The length of neither of these RSLs appears to be compatible with protease inhibition. For maspin to have an RSL of 16 or 17 residues, the P1 residue would be either Gln343 or His344, neither of which is a suitable P1 residue for serine protease inhibition. Gln is not found as a P1 residue in any serpin, and His is found only in the “fast” isoform of α1-PI from guinea pig, a species with multiple α1-PI isoforms and homologs (34Suzuki Y. Yoshida K. Honda E. Sinohara H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 928-932Google Scholar), suggesting that this protein may not be inhibitory. Another critical feature of the RSL is its sequence, as incorporation of the RSL into the β-sheet requires residues to be compatible with adopting β conformation and not to involve burial of unfavorable side chains (33Zhou A. Carrell R.W. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27541-27547Google Scholar). Maspin lacks the Ala-rich sequence found in the RSL of most inhibitory serpins, instead having bulky or charged residues including Ile334 and Glu335. Pro337at the P8 position is particularly unfavorable, being a Thr residue in the majority of inhibitory serpins and a critical determinant of RSL insertion (35Harrop S.J. Jankova L. Coles M. Jardine D. Whittaker J.S. Gould A.R. Meister A. King G.C. Mabbutt B.C. Curmi P.M. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 43-54Google Scholar). P14 is also important in regulating serpin inhibitory function and is also a Thr residue in the inhibitory serpins but Gly in maspin. The introduction of a P14 Thr → Gly mutation in PAI-1 leads to a significant reduction in inhibitory activity (36Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Muhammad S. Day D.E. Kvassman J.O. Ginsburg D. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5839-5844Google Scholar). Maspin also lacks the hinge region P12 Ala residue found in all inhibitory, but never in non-inhibitory, serpins. A corollary of the serpin mechanism is that RSL cleavage by non-target proteases induces a transition from a “stressed” (S) to a “relaxed” (R) form by incorporation of the cleaved RSL into the major β-sheet, equivalent to the insertion occurring during the inhibitory mechanism. However, it has previously been shown that maspin does not undergo this hallmark S → R transition on cleavage at Arg340, the putative P1 residue (25Pemberton P.A. Wong D.T. Gibson H.L. Kiefer M.C. Fitzpatrick P.A. Sager R. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15832-15837Google Scholar), consistent with the preceding structural considerations. Other non-inhibitory serpins also fail to undergo this conformational transition (37Stein P.E. Tewkesbury D.A. Carrell R.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 103-107Google Scholar, 38Mast A.E. Enghild J.J.

These observations strongly suggest that maspin cannot be an inhibitory serpin, in agreement with our failure to detect inhibition of plasminogen activator activity under a wide range of conditions. Our conclusions differ from those of Sheng and co-workers, who claimed that maspin has protease inhibitory activity against both tPA bound to a fibrin surface (27Sheng S.J. Truong B. Fredrickson D. Wu R.L. Pardee A.B. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 499-504Google Scholar) and uPA associated with tumor cells (28McGowen R. Biliran Jr., H. Sager R. Sheng S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4771-4778Google Scholar, 29Biliran Jr., H. Sheng S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8676-8682Google Scholar). This is not easily reconciled, but two lines of argumentation can be proposed that support our conclusions. The first is that the previously reported effects were not characteristic of the standard covalent serpin inhibitory mechanism, being more suggestive of competitive inhibition. Non-inhibitory serpins act as protease substrates and, at sufficiently high concentrations, will act as competitive inhibitors in the same way as other competing substrates. However, as the kinetic mechanism underlying the stimulation of plasminogen activation in the various situations studied here is a large reduction in theK m for plasminogen, the reaction with substrate plasminogen is highly favored and reactions with potential competing substrates equally disfavored. We have used plasminogen concentrations both above and below K m, but no effects indicative of maspin behaving as a competing substrate were observed. Therefore, our data suggest that surface-bound plasminogen activators are no different to the soluble proteases in their reactivity with maspin, with neither being inhibited. The second consideration, in the case of uPA, is that our observations are consistent with the known independence of the C-terminal catalytic domain from the N-terminal uPAR-binding domain (40Oswald R.E. Bogusky M.J. Bamberger M. Smith R.A.G. Dobson C.M. Nature. 1989; 337: 579-582Google Scholar) and our previous observations on the mechanism of enhancement of plasminogen activation by uPAR. We have shown that the catalytic activity of uPA is not affected by uPAR and that the enhanced plasminogen activation is due to the formation of catalytically favored complexes with cell-associated plasminogen (8Ellis V. Behrendt N. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12752-12758Google Scholar, 9Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Werner F. Deadman J.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 651-659Google Scholar,41Ellis V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14779-14784Google Scholar). A consequence of this is that both uPAR-bound uPA and uPA in solution are inhibited by the plasminogen activator inhibitors PAI-1 and PAI-2 with similar kinetics (12Ellis V. Wun T.-C. Behrendt N. Rønne E. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9904-9908Google Scholar). Therefore, the reaction of receptor-bound uPA with other serpins would be expected to be similarly unaffected, i.e. maspin would not be expected to inhibit either free or cell-associated uPA. Maspin has been reported to bind specifically to the cell surface (23Sheng S. Carey J. Seftor E.A. Dias L. Hendrix M.J. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11669-11674Google Scholar,28McGowen R. Biliran Jr., H. Sager R. Sheng S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4771-4778Google Scholar), raising the possibility that this interaction conformationally converts maspin into an inhibitory form or facilitates a reaction between uPA and maspin by close juxtaposition of the proteins. Neither of these possibilities are compatible with the previous considerations regarding the requirements for an inhibitory RSL, although the latter could favor competitive substrate-like behavior. However, our observations provide no evidence for such an effect under conditions where the inhibitory effects of PAI-1 are readily detected. Although it cannot be completely excluded that specific conditions favor inhibitory-like activity in maspin, the observations here that maspin inhibits cell migration in the absence of detectable protease inhibitory activity demonstrates that this is not the mechanism responsible for the biological activity of maspin. Our data are consistent with reports that maspin both directly and indirectly affects cell adhesion, a critical event in the regulation of cell motility. Maspin has recently been shown to bind directly to collagen, an interaction that may contribute to cell adhesion (42Blacque O.E. Worrall D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10783-10788Google Scholar). Interestingly, maspin has also been shown to alter the expression profile of integrins in breast carcinoma cells, in particular inducing the expression of the α5β1 fibronectin receptor (43Seftor R.E. Seftor E.A. Sheng S. Pemberton P.A. Sager R. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5681-5685Google Scholar). Although we have shown here that maspin does not inhibit the activity of uPAR-bound uPA, the reported increase in α5β1 expression by maspin may potentially lead to an indirect effect on this proteolytic system. uPAR is known to associate with α5β1 (44Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Liu D. Mignatti A. Kovalski K. Ossowski L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 863-879Google Scholar), and recent observations in this laboratory indicate that this interaction may lead to a reduction in uPA binding and a concomitant reduction in cell-surface plasminogen activation. 2R. Bass, F. Berditchevski, and V. Ellis, unpublished observations. Therefore, despite lacking protease inhibitory activity, it is possible that maspin can indirectly influence the activity of the cell-surface plasminogen activation system and that this mechanism may contribute to its function as a tumor suppressor.

Biochemical studies indicate that Tax, together with cellular transcription factors, interacts with viral cAMP-response element enhancer elements to recruit the pleiotropic coactivators CREB-binding protein and p300. Histone acetylation by these coactivators has been shown to play a major role in activating HTLV-I transcription from chromatin templates in vitro. However, the extent of histone modification and the precise identity of the cellular regulatory proteins bound at the HTLV-I promoter in vivo is not known. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was used to investigate factor binding and histone modification at the integrated HTLV-I provirus in infected T-cells (SLB-1). These studies reveal the presence of Tax, a variety of ATF/CREB and AP-1 family members (CREB, CREB-2, ATF-1, ATF-2, c-Fos, and c-Jun), and both p300 and CREB-binding protein at the HTLV-I promoter. Consistent with the binding of these coactivators, we observed histone H3 and H4 acetylation at three regions within the proviral genome. Histone deacetylases were also present at the viral promoter and, following their inhibition, we observe an increase in histone H4 acetylation on the HTLV-I promoter and a concomitant increase in viral RNA.

These elements, referred to as viral cyclic AMP-response element (viral CREs), carry a central CRE that serves as a binding site for members of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors. This octanucleotide CRE sequence is immediately flanked by conserved GC-rich DNA sequences.

Transcription factor binding to CBP/p300 brings the coactivators to target promoters, resulting in covalent modification of the promoter-associated nucleosomes. CBP/p300 have been shown to directly acetylate lysine residues present within the amino-terminal tails of all four core histones (24Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

Virology. 2001; 279: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), have also been implicated in binding to the viral CREs and mediating HTLV-I gene expression. This is not surprising, as members of the ATF/CREB and AP-1 families recognize DNA sequences identical or similar to the viral CRE (40van Dam H. Castellazzi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2453-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, previous in vivo footprinting studies have shown occupancy of the viral CREs (41Datta S. Kothari N.H. Fan H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8277-8285Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 42Datta S. Kothari N.H. Fan H. Virology. 2001; 283: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, the identities of these CRE-binding proteins and their roles in the regulation of the chromosomally integrated HTLV-I provirus remain unknown.In this study, we used the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to identify transcription factor and cellular coactivator binding at the proviral promoter in HTLV-I-infected, Tax-expressing human T-cells (SLB-1). We find that, in addition to Tax and CREB, a number of ATF/CREB and AP-1 family members associate with the HTLV-I transcriptional control region in vivo. We also demonstrate the association of both CBP and p300 and the TFIID component TAFII250. Consistent with the activator/coactivator interactions, we find that the nucleosomal histones H3 and H4 are acetylated at the HTLV-I promoter, as well as within the gagand envelope genes of the provirus. Furthermore, we find histone H3 lysine 4 methylation within these same regions. Both of these histone amino-terminal tail modifications are found within transcriptionally active chromatin. Interestingly, we also find the presence of histone deacetylases (HDAC-1–3) at the viral promoter. Treatment of HTLV-I-infected cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitors trichostatin A or sodium butyrate increases H4 acetylation at the HTLV-I promoter and enhances viral transcription, further supporting a direct role for histone acetylation in HTLV-I gene expression.DISCUSSIONIn living T-cells infected with HTLV-I, the specific cellular transcription factors that participate in viral transcription are unknown. Prior studies have relied on in vitro binding and transient transfection assays to determine the transcription factors that interact with the HTLV-I transcriptional control region. Although these studies have implicated a variety of transcription factors, their direct binding to the integrated proviral promoter has never been demonstrated. In this study, we used the ChIP assay to analyze transcription factor and coactivator binding as well as histone modifications at the HTLV-I promoter in infected human T-cells. This approach allows direct detection of essentially any protein at its genomic binding site in vivo, including associated proteins that are not in direct contact with the proviral DNA.Previously, a significant number of in vitro studies have focused on the transcription factor CREB, and based on this work, CREB has been implicated as the primary player in both basal and Tax-activated HTLV-I transcription (12Goren I.

However, a number of additional bZIP proteins have been suggested to participate in HTLV-I transcription (5Grant C. Barmak K. Alefantis T. Yao J. Jacobson S. Wigdahl B. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 133-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The ChIP studies presented herein reveal that, in addition to CREB, several other bZIP proteins bind specifically to the HTLV-I transcriptional control region in living SLB-1 cells. These proteins include ATF-1, ATF-2, and CREB-2 as well as the AP-1 family members c-Fos and c-Jun. Significantly, our data provide the first direct demonstration of an interaction between these bZIP proteins and the HTLV-I promoter under physiological conditions. These observations substantiate many of the previous studies using DNA binding and transient transfection assays. Furthermore, they suggest that a closer examination of the role of these other bZIP proteins in HTLV-I transcription and Tax transactivation is warranted.The fact that multiple factors are found at the HTLV-I promoter is surprising and may indicate that they collectively form a higher order complex, such as an enhanceosome, required for basal transcription and Tax transactivation. Such a complex could augment CBP/p300 recruitment through interactions with multiple DNA-bound bZIP proteins, explaining why at least two viral CREs are required for efficient transactivation (6Brady J.

This type of mechanism has been proposed in other systems (reviewed in Ref. 23Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has recently been shown that the binding of a single activator may be insufficient for CBP recruitmentin vivo (65Lomvardas S. Thanos D. Cell. 2002; 110: 261-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Alternatively, distinct bZIP proteins (or distinct bZIP complexes) may assemble on individual proviral promoters, with each having a unique role in HTLV-I transcription. This scenario permits enhanced flexibility in the protein-DNA complexes that may participate in HTLV-I transcriptional regulation. However, which of these individual proteins or protein complexes mediate Tax transactivation is not known.An essential role for CBP/p300 in activating HTLV-I transcription from chromatin templates has recently been shown in vitro (26Georges S.A. Kraus W.L. Luger K. Nyborg J.K. Laybourn P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,27Lu H. Pise-Masison C.A. Fletcher T.M. Schiltz R.L. Nagaich A.K. Radonovich M. Hager G. Cole P.A. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4450-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).2 Our ChIP assay reveals the presence of both p300 and CBP at the HTLV-I promoter in living T-cells. This observation is intriguing and raises the question as to whether they play distinct or redundant roles in HTLV-I transactivation. Consistent with the binding of CBP and p300, we found histone H3 and H4 acetylation at the HTLV-I promoter and within the proviral genome. Surprisingly, we did not observe a spike in histone acetylation at the viral promoter that would be expected to coincide with the binding of CBP and p300. Instead, we observed enhanced H4 acetylation centered about 525 bp downstream of the transcriptional start site. Histone acetylation has previously been observed within the coding regions of transcriptionally active genes (66Myers F.A. Evans D.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20197-20205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These results are in contrast to a previously reported in vitro ChIP assay that showed H3 and H4 histone acetylation localized to the HTLV-I promoter (27Lu H. Pise-Masison C.A. Fletcher T.M. Schiltz R.L. Nagaich A.K. Radonovich M. Hager G. Cole P.A. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4450-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition to acetylation, we found histone H3 lysine 4 methylation throughout the provirus, another modification associated with transcriptionally active genes (56Wang H. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Borchers C. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1207-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 57Nishioka K. Chuikov S. Sarma K.

Liu J.S. Kouzarides T. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8695-8700Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). It should be noted that in our ChIP assays, analysis of the HTLV-I promoter reveals histone modifications at both the 5′ and 3′ long terminal repeats. If the 3′ long terminal repeat is inactive, then our results represent the average of histone modifications at both active and silenced promoter regions of the provirus. Future studies will be aimed at distinguishing factor binding and histone modifications at the individual long terminal repeats.The regulation of transcriptional activity through histone acetylation is also influenced by HDACs, which serve to remove acetyl groups from the histone tails. We tested for the presence of HDACs on the HTLV-I promoter and found that HDAC-1 to -3 were each associated with at least a subset of HTLV-I promoters in living cells. HDACs may be directly recruited to the HTLV-I promoter by Tax, as has recently been suggested (28Ego T. Ariumi Y. Shimotohno K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7241-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). By inhibiting HDAC function, we show an increase primarily in H4 acetylation at the HTLV-I promoter, concomitant with an increase in viral RNA levels. This study shows that HDACs are localized to the HTLV-I promoter and are involved in regulating HTLV-I transcriptionin vivo, suggesting that a dynamic balance between HDAC and HAT activities may dictate the overall level of HTLV-I transcriptionin vivo.

Mortreux F. Cavrois M. Leroy A. Gessain A. Wain-Hobson S. Wattel E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2305-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Expression of the virally encoded oncoprotein Tax leads to both clonal expansion of the infected cell and efficient expression of the viral genome (4Wattel E. Cavrois M. Gessain A. Wain-Hobson S. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retrovirol. 1996; 13: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To activate HTLV-I transcription, Tax interacts with enhancer elements in the transcriptional control region of the virus in a complex that contains members of the ATF/CREB family of cellular transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 5Grant C. Barmak K. Alefantis T. Yao J. Jacobson S. Wigdahl B. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 133-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).

These elements, referred to as viral cyclic AMP-response element (viral CREs), carry a central CRE that serves as a binding site for members of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors. This octanucleotide CRE sequence is immediately flanked by conserved GC-rich DNA sequences. Tax associates with the viral CREs through protein-DNA interactions with the minor groove of the GC-rich sequences (9Lenzmeier B.A. Giebler H.A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W1970926420,"The Rho family GTPases are pivotal for T cell signaling; however, the regulation of these proteins is not fully known. One well studied regulator of Rho GTPases is Vav1; a hematopoietic cell-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor critical for signaling in T cells, including stimulation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Surprisingly, Vav1 associates with Ly-GDI, a hematopoietic cell-specific guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor of Rac. Here, we studied the functional significance of the interaction between Vav1 and Ly-GDI in T cells. Upon organization of the immunological synapse, both Ly-GDI and Vav1 relocalize to T cell extensions in contact with the antigen-presenting cell. Ly-GDI is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues following T cell receptor stimulation, and it associates with the Src homology 2 region of an adapter protein, Shc. In addition, the interaction between Ly-GDI and Vav1 requires tyrosine phosphorylation. Overexpression of Ly-GDI alone is inhibitory to NFAT stimulation and calcium mobilization. However, when co-expressed with Vav1, Ly-GDI enhances Vav1 induction of NFAT activation, phospholipase Cγ phosphorylation, and calcium mobilization. Moreover, Ly-GDI does not alter the regulation of these phenomena when coexpressed with oncogenic Vav1. Since oncogenic Vav1 does not bind Ly-GDI, this suggests that the functional cooperativity of Ly-GDI and Vav1 is dependent upon their association. Thus, our data suggest that the interaction of Vav1 and Ly-GDI creates a fine tuning mechanism for the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways leading to NFAT stimulation.

The Rho GTPase proteins participate in cellular processes such as cell cycle, movement and migration, metabolism, survival, proliferation, and differentiation (1Ridley A.J.

Rho GTPase proteins cycle between the GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active forms. Extracellular signals can affect Rho GTPase activity through at least three types of regulatory molecules: the GTPase-activating proteins that stimulate conversion from the GTP-bound form to the GDP-bound form; the GDP/GTP exchange factors (GEFs), 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, GDP/GTP exchange factors; GDI, GDP dissociation inhibitor; SH2 and SH3, Src homology 2 and 3, respectively; TCR, T cell receptor; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PLC, phospholipase C; APC, antigen-presenting cell; WT, wild type; DIC, differential interference contrast which facilitate the shift from the GDP-bound form to the GTP-bound form; and the GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which block GDP dissociation from Rho GTPases, thus maintaining the inactive state (4Symons M. Settleman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 415-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Despite accumulating experimental evidence, many details of the regulation of GDP/GTP exchange remain to be elucidated. One of the well studied GEFs for Rho GTPases is Vav1, a hematopoietic cell-specific signal transducer protein (5Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 6Katzav S. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1995; 6: 87-97PubMed Google Scholar). Vav1 contains several characteristic structural motifs that enable its function as a signal transducer protein. In fact, Vav1 and the other ubiquitously expressed members of the Vav family of proteins (Vav2 and Vav3) are the only known Rho GEFs that have SH2 domains, suggesting that their GEF activity is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation (7Abe K.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). One of the best studied roles of Vav1 is as a signal transducer in activated T cells. TCR stimulation with antigen or with cross-linking antibodies initiates a complex signaling cascade. The earliest event in this cascade is the activation of multiple cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, including the Src family tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn. This leads to the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifs on the TCR (11van Oers N.S. Killeen N. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated tyrosines in these immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifs associate with the SH2 domains of ZAP-70, another cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (12Isakov N. Wange R.L. Burgess W.H. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Samelson L.E. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Src tyrosine kinases also phosphorylate and activate ZAP-70, leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins, including Vav1 (5Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 6Katzav S. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1995; 6: 87-97PubMed Google Scholar). TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 leads to activation of its GEF function toward Rac, its preferred target GTPase (9Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 10Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This signaling cascade results in the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), which plays a critical role in the regulation of many genes including interleukin-2 (13Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The cardinal role of Vav1 in NFAT induction is inferred from numerousin vitro and in vivo experiments. Overexpression of Vav1 was shown to induce NFAT stimulation in T cells (13Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This effect was enhanced upon stimulation of TCR (13Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Vav1-deficient cells fail to mobilize calcium and reorganize the cytoskeleton, events that are related to Vav1 GEF activity and are important for NFAT stimulation (14Fischer K.D.

The precise mechanism by which Vav1 induces NFAT is not yet entirely resolved. It is clear that Vav1's function as a GEF toward Rac is important for this process. However, it has been suggested that Rac-independent Vav1 activities are also involved (5Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in T cell activation, Vav1 is also involved in numerous other immune functions such as T-cell development, differentiation, and cell cycle control (19Turner M. Billadeau D.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Vav1 was first isolated as an oncogene (20Katzav S. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). However, wild-type Vav1 transforms NIH3T3 fibroblasts only when it is overexpressed. It is significant to note that converting wild-type Vav1 to an oncogene involves mutations/deletions in its amino terminus (21Katzav S. Cleveland J.L. Heslop H.E. Pulido D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1912-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 22Coppola J. Bryant S. Koda T. Conway D. Barbacid M. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 95-105PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, removal of 66 residues from the amino terminus, mimicking the mode of activation of the originally isolated oncogene, is sufficient to induce transformation by Vav1 in murine fibroblasts. A more potent transforming form of Vav1 is obtained when an even larger (186 residues) region is removed (5Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The amino terminus of Vav1 is not only necessary for regulating its transforming activity but was also found to be important for Vav1-mediated NFAT transcription. Overexpression of wild-type Vav1 in Jurkat T cells leads to activation of NFAT; however, the truncated oncogenic proteins, Vav1-66 and Vav1-186, do not cause any changes in NFAT transcription, even when the TCR is stimulated (5Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar,13Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The amino terminus region resembles a calponin homology region yet is unlikely to directly associate with F-actin, since two such regions in tandem are needed for association with actin (23Gimona M. Winder S.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R674-R675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since this region is devoid of any catalytic activity and is rich in α-helical content, it seemed plausible that it might participate in protein-protein interactions. Indeed, we have recently demonstrated that the amino terminus region of Vav1 interacts in vitro and in vivo with another potential regulator of Rho GTPases, the hematopoietic-specific GDI protein, Ly-GDI (24Groysman M. Shifrin C. Russek N. Katzav S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). GDIs regulate Rho GTPase activity by inhibiting GDP dissociation, promoting the inactive form (4Symons M. Settleman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 415-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 25Olofsson B. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The ubiquitously expressed Rho-GDI also appears to function as a chaperone for the Rho GTPases, shuttling them between the cytosol and the membrane. In addition, Rho-GDI blocks both intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis (4Symons M. Settleman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 415-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 25Olofsson B. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Whether all of these functions are also carried out by Ly-GDI in T cells is still an open question. Stimulation of T lymphocytes and myelomonocytic cells with phorbol esters leads to phosphorylation of Ly-GDI on serine/threonine residues, raising the possibility that Ly-GDI is involved in signaling pathways in these cells (26Gorvel J.P.

A. 1993; 90: 7568-7572Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition, Ly-GDI is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in neutrophils (28Kasper B. Tidow N. Grothues D. Welte K. Blood. 2000; 95: 2947-2953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known if the function of Ly-GDI in these cells is also regulated by extracellular signals. The association between Vav1 and Ly-GDI is particularly intriguing because, theoretically, these two proteins should have opposite effects on the activity of small Rho GTPases. Since the function of Ly-GDI in T cells is largely unknown, we examined its activity, localization, response to TCR stimulation, and potential effect on the function of Vav1 in T cells. Here, we show for the first time that the distribution of Ly-GDI is altered in stimulated T cells and accumulates with Vav1 in the membrane extensions in the periphery of the “immunological synapse.” Ly-GDI exhibits several characteristics of a protein involved in signaling. First, Ly-GDI is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues following TCR stimulation. Second, it associates with the SH2 region of an adapter protein, Shc. Third, Ly-GDI interacts with Vav1 when signaling is enabled in T cells. Ly-GDI can block calcium mobilization in Jurkat cells; however, surprisingly, rather than counteracting the effects of Vav1, Ly-GDI further enhances the induction of NFAT when the TCR is stimulated in T cells overexpressing Vav1. Thus, in T cells, these two regulators of Rho GTPases appear to function cooperatively as signal transducers in the TCR pathway and may be involved in the cytoskeletal reorganization required for formation of the “immunological synapse.” Antibodies were obtained from the following sources: anti-Myc mAbs (clone 9E10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); anti-CD28 mAbs (R&D Systems).

The glutathioneS-transferase bacterial expression vector encoding the SH2 region of Shc was a gift from Dr. N. Isakov (Ben-Gurion University, Beer-Sheva, Israel). Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting were performed as previously described (24Groysman M. Shifrin C. Russek N. Katzav S.

Fusion proteins were purified from transformed Escherichia coli bacteria and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (24Groysman M. Shifrin C. Russek N. Katzav S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Jurkat T cells at 2 × 107 cells/200 μl were activated with anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 (1:100; American Type Tissue Culture Collection) for 2 min at 37 °C. The procedure we followed was similar to the one published by Roumier et al. (30Roumier A. Olivo-Marin J.C. Arpin M. Michel F. Martin M. Mangeat P. Acuto O. Dautry-Varsat A. Alcover A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 715-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, T cell activation with superantigen was performed by pulsing APCs (Raji) for 15 min at 37 °C with 5 μg ofStaphylococcus enterotoxin E superantigen. T cells were then incubated with the APCs at various periods as indicated under “Results.” Cells were then placed on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, allowed to sediment for 5 min, and then centrifuged 1 min at 200 × g and fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde. Intracellular proteins were stained in 0.05% saponin, whereas immunofluorescence staining of TCR was performed without permeabilization. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy analysis were performed as previously described (30Roumier A. Olivo-Marin J.C. Arpin M. Michel F. Martin M. Mangeat P. Acuto O. Dautry-Varsat A. Alcover A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 715-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells (Jurkat Tag) were transfected as previously described (13Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For the electroporations the following amounts of plasmids were used: pEF-VavF, 8 μg; pEF-oncoVav, 8 μg; Ly-GDI, 16 μg; Rho-GDI, 16 μg; NFAT-luc, 5 μg; and β-galactosidase, 1 μg. Cells were lysed after the indicated time and treatment, and luciferase activity, in duplicate samples, was measured and normalized to the β-galactosidase values. Cytosolic and particulate (membrane) fractions were obtained as previously described (31Gelkop S. Isakov N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21519-21527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were resuspended in a buffer that contains 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin. The cells were repeatedly aspirated through a 1-ml syringe with a 26-gauge needle. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min to remove nuclear pellets and then recentrifuged at 100,000 × g. Triton X-100 was added to generate a final concentration of 1% in the supernatants (cytosolic fractions) and the pellets (particulate, membrane fraction) that were resuspended in the above mentioned buffer. Jurkat T cells (2 × 106/ml) treated as indicated under “Results” were resuspended in RPMI and 2% fetal calf serum and dually loaded with Fluo-3/AM (4 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) and Fura Red-AM (10 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) for 45 min at 37 °C. Cells were then rinsed and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Each sample was left untreated for 30 s, and then cells were stimulated by the addition of anti-human CD3 and anti-mouse IgG. Calcium mobilization was determined by the intensity ratio of Fluo-3/Fura Red fluorescence over time as recorded by flow cytometry. Upon stimulation of the T cell, redistribution of signaling molecules occurs leading to the formation of an organized “immunological synapse” at the contact between a T cell and an APC (32Dustin M.L. Cooper J.A. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 33Bromley S.K. Burack W.R. Johnson K.G. Somersalo K. Sims T.N. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 375-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). High resolution immunofluorescence imaging of T cell-APC conjugates allows the visualization of two distinct regions within the immunological synapse: the central zone and the peripheral zone. The central zone (c-SMAC) contains the TCR, surface co-stimulatory receptors such as CD28, and intracellular signaling molecules such as protein kinase Cθ, whereas the peripheral zone (p-SMAC), is enriched for the integrin LFA-1 and the actin-binding protein talin (34Potter T.A. Grebe K. Freiberg B. Kupfer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12624-12629Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 35Kupfer A. Nat.

It is widely believed that reorganization of the immunological synapse is required for TCR signaling (32Dustin M.L. Cooper J.A. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 33Bromley S.K. Burack W.R. Johnson K.G. Somersalo K. Sims T.N. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 375-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). F-actin plays a critical role in this reorganization (32Dustin M.L. Cooper J.A. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The polymerization of F-actin is regulated by Rac (37Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar); therefore, it was of interest to establish the involvement of the Rac regulators, Vav1 and the GDIs, in organization of the immunological synapse. We used confocal microscopy to determine the localization of Vav1 and Ly-GDI during the formation of the immunological synapse. This approach allowed us to determine the specific subcellular localization of these proteins in Jurkat T cells, information that could not be achieved by biochemical approaches. Jurkat cells were incubated with APCs either unpulsed (control) or prepulsed (activated) with S. enterotoxin E superantigen and the intracellular localization of Vav1 and Ly-GDI was determined with two-color immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig. 1, an accumulation of Vav1 in membrane extensions in the contact area with the APC was observed at 5 min (B), was maximal at 15 min (C), and was mostly undetectable at 30 min (D). Likewise, Ly-GDI accumulated in these membrane extensions overlapping Vav1 accumulation in these areas and following the same kinetics (Fig.1, B–D). In addition to the accumulation in membrane extensions, a minute fraction of Vav1 was also observed in the central zone of the junction, whereas Ly-GDI was mainly seen in the extensions and not in the center. In contrast, in conjugates formed by T cells and unpulsed APCs, no relocalization of Vav1 or Ly-GDI was observed at any of the incubation times (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). Contrary to Ly-GDI, no accumulation of Rho-GDI in the contact area seemed to occur (Fig. 2). Thus, the same fluorescence density of Rho-GDI was observed in the membrane extensions in contact with the APC and in other areas of the cell (Fig. 2,B–D). These data indicate that Vav1 and Ly-GDI, but not Rho-GDI, translocate to membrane extensions in contact with the APC in response to superantigen stimulation. Their accumulation was transient and correlated with strong T cell shape changes in the contact zone with the APC.Figure 2Relocalization of Vav1 and Rho-GDI upon activation of T cells. This experiment was identical to that described in the legend to Fig. 1, except that anti-Rho-GDI Abs were used in place of anti-Ly-GDI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Activation-induced changes in cell shape usually correlate with modified actin dynamics in particular subcellular areas. Since Vav1 and Ly-GDI are regulators of Rac GTPase and this in turn can control actin dynamics (37Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether subcellular accumulations of Vav1 and Ly-GDI coincided with actin polymerization in these areas. To this end, three-color immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy analyzed the presence of Vav1, Ly-GDI, and F-actin. As shown in Fig.3 B, the membrane extensions in contact with the APC that displayed accumulation of Vav1 and Ly-GDI were also enriched in F-actin. Therefore, a correlation seems to exist between accumulation of Vav1 and Ly-GDI and increased actin polymerization in these subcellular areas. In contrast to activated cells, nonactivated T cell-APC conjugates did not display accumulation of F-actin, Vav1, and Ly-GDI in the contact area (Fig. 3 A). Comparison of staining for TCR-CD3, Vav1, and Ly-GDI revealed that Vav1 and Ly-GDI accumulations occurred at the periphery of the T cell-APC contact site, whereas the TCR-CD3 clustered in the center. Some overlap between TCR-CD3 and Vav1 staining was observed in the center of the contact zone, although Vav1 was mostly present in the peripheral cell extensions (Fig. 3 D). Altogether, these immunolocalization experiments indicate that Vav1 and Ly-GDI accumulate in the contact zone between T cells and stimulatory APCs within membrane extensions that transiently form and enlarge the contact area between the cells. These extensions are also enriched in F-actin, suggesting that a correlation exists between Vav1 and Ly-GDI accumulation and increased actin dynamics in these cellular areas. Activation of the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rho family GTPases is accompanied by their intracellular translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. The subcellular localization of the regulators of Rho GTPases is less well established, although Vav1 was shown to be recruited to the plasma membrane in response to activation of Fc receptors (38Coppolino M.G. Krause M. Hagendorff P. Monner D.A. Trimble W. Grinstein S. Wehland J. Sechi A.S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4307-4318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GDI regulators, Ly-GDI and Rho-GDI, are considered to be predominantly cytosolic (25Olofsson B. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Our confocal microscopy results raised the possibility that Vav1 and Ly-GDI proteins are present in the same cellular microenvironment upon activation of Jurkat T cells (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3), suggesting that these proteins might cooperate. To explore this possibility, we first established whether Vav1 and Ly-GDI interact in specific subcellular compartments in Jurkat T cells. Vav1, Ly-GDI, and Rho-GDI were found predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 A). Immunoblotting with anti-CD28 mAbs and anti-actin mAbs verified the purity of the particulate (membrane) and cytoplasmic fractions and ruled out significant cross-contamination (Fig. 4 A). We demonstrated previously that Vav1 and Ly-GDI associate in T cells bothin vitro and in vivo (24Groysman M. Shifrin C. Russek N. Katzav S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To further investigate the subcellular localization of their interaction, cytoplasmic and particulate (membrane) fractions of Jurkat T cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Vav1 Abs (Fig. 4 B) and immunoblotted with either anti-Vav1 mAbs (Fig. 4 B,upper panel) or with anti-Ly-GDI Abs (Fig.4 B, lower panel). Co-immunoprecipitation of Vav1 and Ly-GDI was observed in the cytoplasmic fraction and was not apparent in the particulate fraction (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, Rho-GDI, previously shown to bind to Vav1 in vitro (24Groysman M. Shifrin C. Russek N. Katzav S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), does not associate with Vav1"

However, it is unknown which of these many target genes play primary roles in determining the antidiabetic and hypolipidemic effects of thiazolidinediones. To specifically investigate the role of the Cd36 fatty acid transporter gene in the insulin-sensitizing actions of thiazolidinediones, we studied the metabolic effects of pioglitazone in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) that harbor a deletion mutation in Cd36 in comparison to congenic and transgenic strains of SHR that express wild-typeCd36. In congenic and transgenic SHR with wild-typeCd36, administration of pioglitazone was associated with significantly lower circulating levels of fatty acids, triglycerides, and insulin as well as lower hepatic triglyceride levels and epididymal fat pad weights than in SHR harboring mutant Cd36. Additionally, insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation in isolated soleus muscle was significantly augmented in pioglitazone-fed rats with wild-type Cd36 versus those with mutantCd36. The Cd36 genotype had no effect on pioglitazone-induced changes in blood pressure. These findings provide direct pharmacogenetic evidence that in the SHR model, Cd36is a key determinant of the insulin-sensitizing actions of a thiazolidinedione ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ.

Thiazolidinediones such as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone have attracted considerable attention for the treatment of type II diabetes. The insulin-sensitizing effects of these compounds are believed to be related at least in part to their ability to bind to the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ), 1The abbreviations used are: (PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; SHR, spontaneously hypertensive rats; FFA, free fatty acid; AUC, area under curve; NEFA, nonesterified fatty acids. 1The abbreviations used are: (PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; SHR, spontaneously hypertensive rats; FFA, free fatty acid; AUC, area under curve; NEFA, nonesterified fatty acids. a nuclear hormone receptor that regulates the expression of multiple genes involved in the control of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (1Lehmann J.M.

Although many genes and metabolic pathways are likely to be involved in the insulin-sensitizing action of PPARγ ligands, it has been proposed that the effect of thiazolidinediones on genes regulating free fatty acid (FFA) transport and metabolism may be one of the key mechanisms responsible for the antidiabetic effects of these drugs (2Kliewer S.A.

Accordingly, a number of investigators have suggested that thiazolidinediones may attenuate insulin resistance by increasing the metabolic clearance of FFA and decreasing FFA levels in the circulation. The fatty acid transporter CD36 is one of a number of molecules that mediate the uptake of FFA by adipocytes and muscle cells (15Abumrad N.A. Elmaghrabi M.R. Amri E.Z. Lopez E. Grimaldi P.A. J.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2316-2322Google Scholar) reported that infusion of FFA induces reductions in systemic glucose disposal rate that are paralleled by decreases in muscle expression of CD36. These investigators also found that oral administration of the thiazolidinedione troglitazone can attenuate the decreases in CD36 expression and glucose disposal rate otherwise induced by infusion of FFA (6Hevener A.L. Reichart D. Janez A. Olefsky J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2316-2322Google Scholar). Based on these correlational observations, Hevener and colleagues have proposed that the insulin-sensitizing effects of thiazolidinediones may at least be partly mediated by their effects onCd36 expression and FFA metabolism (6Hevener A.L. Reichart D. Janez A. Olefsky J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2316-2322Google Scholar). The availability of animal models lacking Cd36 provides an opportunity to use a pharmacogenetic approach to specifically test the proposed role of Cd36 in the insulin-sensitizing actions of thiazolidinediones. Based on the hypothesis of Hevener and colleagues, it might be predicted that the insulin-sensitizing effects of thiazolidinediones would be attenuated in animals lackingCd36 (6Hevener A.L. Reichart D. Janez A. Olefsky J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2316-2322Google Scholar). We now report a positive test of this hypothesis by showing that the insulin-sensitizing actions of pioglitazone are impaired in spontaneously hypertensive rats harboring mutantCd36 compared with congenic and transgenic strains of spontaneously hypertensive rats expressing wild-type Cd36. Whereas previous studies have demonstrated that PPARγ ligands can alter the expression of multiple genes related to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (3Way J.M. Harrington W.W. Brown K.K.

We compared the SHR progenitor strain carrying a spontaneous mutation in Cd36 that abolishes membrane expression of CD36 protein to a congenic strain and transgenic strain of SHR that express wild-type Cd36 (19Pravenec M.

The progenitor strain of SHR with defective Cd36 descends from inbred SHR originally obtained from National Institutes of Health and was beyond the F90 generation when derivation of the congenic and transgenic strains was initiated. The defect in Cd36 in the SHR progenitor strain has been previously described in detail (21Aitman T.J. Glazier A.M. Wallace C.A. Cooper L.D. Norsworthy P.J. Wahid F.N. Al-Majali K.M. Trembling P.M.

The SHR.BN-Il6/Npy (abbreviated as SHR-4) congenic strain was derived by backcrossing an inbred Brown Norway strain (Charles River Laboratories) with the SHR progenitor strain for 8 generations (19Pravenec M. Zidek V. Simakova M. Kren V. Krenova D. Horky K. Jachymova M. Mikova B. Kazdova L. Aitman T.J. Churchill P.C. Webb R.C. Hingarh N.H. Yang Y. Wang J.M. Lezin E.M. Kurtz T.W. J.

St Lezin E. Kurtz T.W. Kren V. Pravenec M. Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N.A. Stanton L.W. Scott J. Nat.Genet. 1999; 21: 76-83Google Scholar). The SHR-4 congenic strain is 99% genetically identical to the SHR progenitor strain, which differs only with respect to the region of chromosome 4 that includes Cd36. Details regarding derivation and characterization of the SHR-4 congenic strain have been previously described (19Pravenec M. Zidek V. Simakova M. Kren V. Krenova D. Horky K. Jachymova M. Mikova B. Kazdova L. Aitman T.J. Churchill P.C. Webb R.C. Hingarh N.H. Yang Y. Wang J.M. Lezin E.M. Kurtz T.W. J. Clin.Invest. 1999; 103: 1651-1657Google Scholar, 21Aitman T.J. Glazier A.M. Wallace C.A.

Nat.Genet. 1999; 21: 76-83Google Scholar). SHR-4 congenic rats of the N8F8 generation were used in the current study. The SHR/Ola-TgN(EF1aCd36)19Ipcv (abbreviated as SHR-TG19) transgenic rats were derived by microinjecting SHR progenitor zygotes with wild-type Cd36 cDNA under control of the elongation factor 1α promoter (20Pravenec M. Landa V. Zidek V. Musilova A. Kren V. Kazdova L. Aitman T.J. Glazier A.M. Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N.A. Qi N. Wang J.M. St Lezin E.M. Kurtz T.W. Nat.Genet. 2001; 27: 156-158Google Scholar). Details regarding derivation of the transgenic strain and the expression pattern of the Cd36transgene have been previously described (20Pravenec M. Landa V. Zidek V. Musilova A. Kren V. Kazdova L. Aitman T.J. Glazier A.M. Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N.A. Qi N. Wang J.M. St Lezin E.M. Kurtz T.W. Nat.Genet. 2001; 27: 156-158Google Scholar). In the current studies, we used SHR-TG19 transgenic rats of the F7 generation that were homozygous for the Cd36 transgene as confirmed by progeny testing. For in vivo studies, a minimum of 8 animals were studied in each group and for in vitro studies, a minimum of 5 animals were studied in each group. All experiments were performed in agreement with the Animal Protection Law of the Czech Republic (311/1997) which corresponds fully to the European Community Council recommendations for the use of laboratory animals 86/609/ECC. The experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Physiology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague. Control groups from each strain (without pioglitazone) were compared with treatment groups from each strain (with pioglitazone). The control groups was fed standard chow from weaning and then given a semi-synthetic diet containing 60% fructose (TD 00202, Harlan Teklad, Madison, Wisconsin) beginning at 8 weeks of age. The treatment groups from each strain were treated identically to the control groups but in addition were given pioglitazone mixed in the high fructose diet (300 mg/kg of diet). After 13 days of fructose feeding, oral glucose tolerance tests were performed using a glucose load of 300 mg/100 g body weight after 7 h of fasting. Blood was drawn from the tail without anesthesia before the glucose load (0 min time point) and at 30, 60, and 120 min thereafter. The area under the glucose curve (AUC) above the baseline at 0 min was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. After 15 days of fructose feeding, serum levels of glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) were measured in nonfasted animals. Blood samples were clotted at 4 °C, centrifuged, and the sera were kept frozen until analysis. At the end of the study, body weights were determined, the rats sacrificed by decapitation, and blood and tissues were collected for experimental measurements. Additional groups of SHR progenitor and SHR-4 congenic rats were used to investigate the effects of Cd36 genotype on pioglitazone-induced changes in arterial blood pressure and heart rate. Insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation was determined in isolated soleus muscle by measuring the effects of insulin on incorporation of [U-14C]glucose into CO2according to Vrana et al. (23Vrana A. Poledne R. Fabry P. Kazdova L. Metabolism. 1978; 27: 885-888Google Scholar). After decapitation, the soleus muscles were attached to a stainless steel frame in situ or at in vivo length by special clips and separated from other muscles and tendons and immediately incubated for 2 h in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.4 that contained 5.5 mm unlabeled glucose, 0.5 μCi/ml of [U-14Cglucose, and 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Armour, Fraction V) with or without 250 microunits/ml insulin. After 2 h incubation, 0.3 ml of 1 m hyamine hydroxide was injected into central compartment of the incubation vessel and 0.5 ml of 1 m H2SO4 into the main compartment to liberate CO2. The vessels were incubated for another 30 min, the hyamine hydroxide was then quantitatively transferred into the scintillation vial containing 10 ml of toluene-based scintillation fluid for counting of radioactivity. For measurement of insulin-stimulated incorporation of glucose into glycogen, soleus muscles were incubated for 2 h in 95% O2 + 5% CO2 in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 μCi/ml of [U-14C]glucose, 5 mmol/L of unlabeled glucose, and 2.5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (Armour, Fraction V), with or without 250 μunits/ml insulin. Glycogen was extracted, and insulin-stimulated incorporation of glucose into glycogen determined as previously described (23Vrana A. Poledne R. Fabry P. Kazdova L. Metabolism. 1978; 27: 885-888Google Scholar). Measurement of insulin-stimulated lipogenesis from glucose was performed as previously described (24Vrana A. Zak A. Kazdova L. Nutr.Rep.Int. 1988; 38: 687-690Google Scholar). Briefly, the distal segments of epididymal adipose tissue (200–250 mg) were incubated in vials containing 3 ml of modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer with 2.5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (Armour, Fraction V.), 0.1 μCi/ml [14C]glucose, and 5.5 mmol/l unlabeled glucose at pH 7.4 with a gas phase of 95% O2 + 5% CO2. After incubation with and without 250 microunits of insulin for 120 min, pieces of adipose tissue were rinsed in saline and homogenized, and the total lipids were extracted for counting to determine the nmol of glucose converted into lipid per gram of adipose tissue as previously described (24Vrana A. Zak A. Kazdova L. Nutr.Rep.Int. 1988; 38: 687-690Google Scholar). For determination of triglycerides in liver and soleus muscle, tissues were powdered under liquid N2 and extracted for 16 h in chloroform:methanol, after which 2% KH2PO4 was added, and the solution was centrifuged. The organic phase was removed and evaporated under N2. The resulting pellet was dissolved in isopropyl alcohol, and triglyceride content was determined by enzymatic assay (Lachema, Brno, Czech republic). Arterial blood pressures and heart rates were measured continuously in unanaesthetized, unrestrained male SHR progenitor rats and SHR-4 congenic rats from 80 days of age using radiotelemetry. All rats were allowed to recover for at least 10 days from surgical implantation of radiotelemetry transducers. Pulsatile pressures and heart rats were recorded in 5-s bursts every 5 min throughout the day and night for 10 weeks. 24-hour averages for mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were calculated for each rat in each day of the study. The results from each rat in the same group were then averaged to obtain the group means. Rats were fed 60% fructose powder chow (TD 00202, Harlan Teklad, Madison, Wisconsin) and tap waterad libitum throughout the study. Pioglitazone was added in the high fructose diet (300 mg/kg of diet) from 94 to 122 days and 136 to 150 days of age. Blood glucose levels were measured by the glucose oxidase assay (Lachema, Brno, Czech Republic) using tail vein blood drawn into 5% trichloroacetic acid and promptly centrifuged. Serum NEFA levels were determined using an acyl-CoA oxidase-based colorimetric kit ((Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Serum triglycerides and total cholesterol concentrations were measured by standard enzymatic methods (Lachema, Brno, Czech Republic). Serum insulin concentrations were determined using a rat insulin radioimmunoassay kit (Amersham Biosciences).Cd36 gene expression was determined by Northern blot analysis of epididymal fat tissue as previously described (20Pravenec M. Landa V. Zidek V. Musilova A. Kren V. Kazdova L. Aitman T.J. Glazier A.M. Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N.A. Qi N. Wang J.M. St Lezin E.M. Kurtz T.W. Nat.Genet. 2001; 27: 156-158Google Scholar, 21Aitman T.J.

Stanton L.W. Scott J. Nat.Genet. 1999; 21: 76-83Google Scholar) and further quantified by real-time PCR using the cyclophilin (peptidylprolyl isomerase A) gene as an internal control and primers specific for wild-type Cd36. The upstream primers were CAAATGCTGGACCCAACACA (cyclophilin A) and TCAAGGTGTGCTCAACAGCC (Cd36); the downstream primers were TGCCATCCAACCACTCAGTC (cyclophilin A) and AGGATAAAACACACCAACTGT (Cd36). The RNA was reverse transcribed using random primers and the cDNA was amplified by real-time PCR using QuantiTect SYBR Green reagents (Qiagen) on an Opticon continuous fluorescence detector (MJ Research) running 35 cycles of the following protocol: 1 min denaturation at 95 °C, 30 s annealing at 51.2 °C for Cd36 or 58.9 °C for cyclophilin, followed by 30 s extension at 72 °C. Post-PCR melting curves confirmed the specificity of single-target amplification and -fold expression of Cd36relative to cyclophilin was determined in triplicate using the preferred method of Muller et al. (25Muller P.Y. Janovjak H. Miserez Z. Dobbie Z. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 1372-1379Google Scholar). All data are expressed as means ± S.E. Two-way analysis of variance was used to test for effects of strain, pioglitazone treatment, and strain × treatment interactions on the dependent variables of interest. Differences between control versus treatment groups within a strain were evaluated by Student's t test, and differences among strains within groups were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's method to adjust for multiple comparisons using the SHR strain as the control. Statistical significance was defined asp < 0.05. Before starting the high fructose diet, mean body weights of the three strains were similar with the SHR-4 congenic strain (193 ± 3 g) weighing slightly less (p < .05) than the SHR progenitor strain (209 ± 3 g) and SHR-TG19 transgenic strain (214 ± 3 g) (Fig. 1A). Within each strain, rats treated with pioglitazone gained the same amount of weight as untreated rats (Fig. 1B), so no excess weight gain was observed during the pioglitazone treatment. The SHR-4 congenic rats gained ∼10 grams more than the SHR progenitor rats and the SHR-TG10 transgenic rats (both p < .05), perhaps because of their slightly lower body weights at the beginning of the study (Fig. 1B). Compared with control treatment (no pioglitazone), administration of pioglitazone was associated with significant reductions in NEFA levels in both the SHR-4 congenic (p < .005) and SHR-TG19 transgenic (p < .001) strains expressing wild-typeCd36, but this effect did not achieve statistical significance in the SHR progenitor strain harboring defectiveCd36 (p = .06) (Fig. 2A). Without pioglitazone treatment, mean serum NEFA levels were 0.72 ± 0.06, 0.77 ± 0.05, and 0.70 ± 0.06 mmol/L in the SHR-4, SHR-TG19, and SHR progenitor strains, respectively. With pioglitazone treatment, serum NEFA levels were 0.37 ± 0.03, 0.47 ± 0.02, and 0.56 ± 0.04 mmol/liter, respectively. With pioglitazone treatment, analysis of variance showed a significant strain effect on NEFA levels (p < .005) with significantly lower values in the SHR-4 congenic and SHR-TG19 transgenic strains compared with the SHR progenitor strain. Compared with control treatment (no pioglitazone), administration of pioglitazone was also associated with significant reductions in triglyceride levels in the SHR-4 congenic (p < .005) and SHR-TG19 transgenic (p < .005) strains expressing wild-type Cd36 but not in the SHR progenitor strain harboring defective Cd36 (p = .38) (Fig. 2B). Without pioglitazone treatment, mean serum triglyceride levels were 1.7 ± 0.2, 1.7 ± 0.1, and 1.8 ± 0.2 mmol/liter in the SHR-4, SHR-TG19, and SHR progenitor strains, respectively. With pioglitazone treatment, serum trigylceride levels were 1.0 ± 0.1, 1.3 ± 0.1, and 1.5 ± 0.2 mmol/liter, respectively. Analysis of variance showed a significant strain effect on NEFA levels (p < .005) with significantly lower values observed in the pioglitazone-treated SHR-4 congenic and SHR-TG19 transgenic strains compared with the pioglitazone-treated SHR progenitor strain (p < .05 by Dunnett's method). The effects of pioglitazone on serum insulin levels are shown in Fig. 3. Analysis of variance showed a significant effect of strain (p < .002) and treatment (p < .001) on serum insulin levels. Pioglitazone treatment was associated with significantly lower serum insulin levels in the SHR congenic and transgenic strains but not in the SHR progenitor strain harboring mutant Cd36. Serum insulin levels in pioglitazone-treated SHR congenic rats, 0.48 ± 0.03 nmol/liter, and in pioglitazone-treated SHR-TG19 transgenic rats, 0.58 ± 0.05 nmol/liter, were significantly lower than in pioglitazone-treated SHR, 0.75 ± 0.05 nmol/liter (bothp < .05). There was no significant effect of pioglitazone on serum glucose levels in the three strains (SHR, 5.7 ± 0.2 mmol/liter with pioglitazone versus 5.3 ± 0.1 mmol/liter without pioglitazone; SHR-TG19 transgenic, 5.7 ± 0.1 mmol/liter with pioglitazone versus 5.6 ± 0.1 mmol/liter without pioglitazone; SHR-4 congenic, 6.2 ± 0.2 mmol/liter with pioglitazone versus 6.1 ± 0.2 mmol/liter without pioglitazone). In the absence of pioglitazone, oral glucose tolerance was not significantly different among the three strains by analysis of variance, although there was a tendency for better glucose tolerance in the SHR-TG19 strain compared with the SHR-4 congenic strain and SHR progenitor strain (AUC = 155 ± 23 mmol·liter−1·2 h−1, 189 ± 18 mmol·liter−1·2 h−1, and 181 ± 2 mmol·liter−1·2 h−1, respectively) (Fig. 4). With pioglitazone, oral glucose tolerance was significantly better in both the SHR-TG19 transgenic strain (AUC = 163 ± 10 mmol·liter−1·2 h−1) and the SHR-4 congenic strain (AUC = 154 ± 7 mmol·liter−1·2 h−1), compared with the SHR progenitor strain (AUC = 193 ± 16 mmol·liter−1·2 h−1, bothp < .05) (Fig. 4). Glucose tolerance in the SHR-4 congenic rats fed pioglitazone was also significantly better than in the SHR-4 congenic rats not given pioglitazone (p < .05) (Fig. 4). Glucose tolerance was similar in SHR with or without pioglitazone and in SHR-TG19 rats with and without pioglitazone. In the SHR-TG19 strain, the lack of effect of pioglitazone on the oral glucose tolerance AUC may have been related to its modest level ofCd36 expression and the more modest effects of pioglitazone on NEFA levels in this strain.Figure 4Oral glucose tolerance tests in rats treated with pioglitazone compared with rats not given pioglitazone. *, significantly greater (p < .05) area under the curve in SHR rats treated with pioglitazone compared with SHR-4 and SHR-TG19 rats treated with pioglitazone. #, significant difference (p < .05) in area under the curve in SHR-4 rats treated with pioglitazone compared with SHR-4 rats not treated with pioglitazone.

In the absence of insulin, pioglitazone treatment had no effect on glucose oxidation in soleus muscles from any of the strains (data not shown). However, in the presence of insulin, pioglitazone treatment induced increases in glucose oxidation in both the SHR transgenic and congenic strains, although statistical significance was achieved only in the TG19 strain (p < .05) (Fig. 5). No effect on insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation was observed in the SHR progenitor strain with mutant Cd36 (Fig. 5). As a consequence, insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation in SHR treated with pioglitazone, 141 ± 21 nmol glucose·g tissue−1·2h−1, was significantly lower (p < .05) than in the pioglitazone-treated SHR-4 congenic strain, 276 ± 51 glucose·g tissue−1·2h−1, and in the pioglitazone-treated SHR transgenic strain, 316 ± 44 glucose·g tissue−1·2h−1 (Fig. 4). No differential effects of pioglitazone treatment were observed on incorporation of glucose into diaphragm muscle glycogen or into adipose tissue lipids between any of the strains (data not shown). Epididymal fat pad weights, which were similar among the three strains, were significantly increased by pioglitazone treatment (Fig. 6). The magnitude of the increase appeared greatest in the SHR progenitors, where epididymal fat pad weight at the end of the treatment, 1.4 ± 0.4 g/100 g body weight, was significantly greater (p < .05) than in both the SHR-4 congenic strain, 1.1 ± 0.3 g/100 g body weight, and the SHR-TG19 strain, 1.29 ± 0.3 g/100 g body weight (Fig. 6).

https://openalex.org/W1980419634,"The mammalian eye is a remarkable optical device, but its design is not perfect. The blood vessels that supply the inner retina are located in front of the photoreceptor layer, blocking access to light. Their shadows create a pattern of blindness in the field of vision that corresponds precisely to the location of the largest vessels in the eye. We show here that in squirrel monkeys, focal deprivation by blood vessels leads to rewiring of the eye's geniculocortical projections, imprinting an image of the retinal vascular tree onto the primary visual cortex. This process illustrates vividly that local imbalances in neuronal activity can influence column formation during normal development."

Immunofluorescence staining showed that CD38 was expressed not only on the surface of intact HL-60 cells but also intracellularly, which was revealed after permeabilization with Triton. Concomitant with CD38 expression was the accumulation of cADPR, and both time courses preceded the onset of differentiation, suggesting a causal role for CD38. Consistently, treatment of HL-60 cells with a permeant inhibitor of CD38, nicotinamide, inhibited both the CD38 activity and differentiation. More specific blockage of CD38 expression was achieved by using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides targeting its mRNA, which produced a corresponding inhibition of differentiation as well. Similar inhibitory effects were observed when CD38 expression was reduced by the RNA interference technique targeting two separate regions of the coding sequence of CD38. Further support came from transfecting HL-60 cells with a Tet-On expression vector containing a full-length CD38. Subsequent treatments with doxycycline induced both CD38 expression and differentiation in the absence of retinoic acid. These results provide the first evidence that CD38 expression and the consequential accumulation of cADPR play a causal role in mediating cellular differentiation.

The cell line is derived from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia and can be induced to differentiate in vitro to a number of different cell types, such as granulocytes, monocytes, or macrophages (22Collins S.J. Blood. 1987; 70: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is a widely used model system for elucidating hemopoietic differentiation (22Collins S.J.

In this study we present evidence that the CD38 expression may play a causal role in mediating the differentiation process in HL-60 cells. ADP-ribosyl cyclase was prepared by a yeast expression system as described previously (24Munshi C. Lee H.C. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 11: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Alcohol dehydrogenase from yeast (suitable for cycling), activated charcoal, diaphorase fromClostridium kluyveri, NAD+, nicotinamide, nucleotide pyrophosphatase from Crotalus atrox venom, NADase from Neurospora crassa, NBT, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, resazurin, tri-n-octylamine Tris, and 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane were from Sigma. Alkaline phosphatase from bovine intestine was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Centricon filters and Immobilon filter plates were from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Alexa Fluor goat anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Molecular Probes. HL-60 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were maintained in suspension in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf bovine serum and kept at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were passaged by dilution in fresh medium to a density of about 0.2 × 106 cells/ml. Prior to induction of differentiation by retinoic acid (RA), the cells were maintained at a logarithmic growth rate and seeded at a density of 0.2 × 106 cells/ml. RA was added at a final concentration of 1 μm by dilution from a 10 mm stock solution prepared in Me2SO. Control cells were treated with a similar dilution of Me2SO, which was found to have no effect on the differentiation or the rate of cell division. At the indicated times of continuous exposure to RA, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min. Differentiation of HL-60 cells was measured by adding 1 ml of cell suspension (0.5–2 × 106 cells) to a solution containing 2 mg/ml of NBT and 20 ng/ml of phorbol myristate acetate in phosphate-buffered saline. The incubation was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C and was stopped by the addition of 0.4 ml of cold 2 m HCl. The formazan product was obtained by centrifugation of the sample at 700 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the formazan was dissolved in 1 ml of Me2SO. The absorbance of the solution was measured at 590 nm. The data are expressed as absorbance units/106 cells. Following treatment of HL-60 cells with RA, 1.5–2 × 106 cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min. The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 2.5% fetal bovine serum and 0.02% NaN3) and washed once by a centrifugation step at 14,000 × g for 20 s in a microcentrifuge and resuspended in 125 μl of FACS buffer. The cells were incubated with the primary monoclonal antibody, IB4 (1:100), for 30 min on ice and washed once in 1 ml of FACS buffer and resuspended in 200 μl. The secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor goat anti-mouse IgG, was added at a dilution of 1:200, and the sample was incubated on ice after mixing and kept in the dark to avoid bleaching. The cells were then washed twice and resuspended in 1 ml of FACS buffer containing 1% paraformaldehyde. The samples were sorted on a FACScalibur instrument, and data from 10,000 cells were collected and analyzed by the CELLQuest Pro software. Acid extracts were prepared for 5–20 × 106 cells after centrifugation and the addition of 0.5–1 ml of cold 0.6 m perchloric acid, which could be stored at −80 °C until processing. After thawing, the acid was removed by extraction with a solution (3:1) of 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane and tri-n-octylamine on ice as described (25Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The neutral extracts were supplemented with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, and treated with an enzyme mixture containing 0.44 unit/ml nucleotide pyrophosphatase, 0.0625 unit/ml NADase, 12.5 units/ml alkaline phosphatase, and 2 mm MgCl2 for 15–18 h at 37 °C as described (25Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), to effectively remove interfering nucleotides, such as NAD, without degrading cADPR. Subsequently, the enzymes were removed by ultrafiltration with Centricon filters or 96-well Immobilon-P plates. The cADPR in the extracts was measured by an enzyme cycling assay as described previously (25Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For comparison, cADPR standards were prepared in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, and processed in a manner identical to that of the cell extracts. This parallel processing of cADPR standards allowed for adjustment of losses of cADPR resulting from the procedure, which was typically about 30%. The enzyme cycling assay was performed in 96- or 384-well plates, using sample volumes of 100 or 40 μl, respectively. The cADPR content was determined from the slopes of fluorescence increase of samples and compared with those produced by cADPR standards (25Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The assay of cADPR was linear in the concentration range from 0 to 25 nm. The cADPR content was expressed in pmol/106cells. NAD content of extracts was measured by the cycling assay before enzyme treatment. Extracts were prepared by centrifugation of 2.5–10 × 106 cells and resuspension in 0.5 ml of a cold solution containing 10 mmTris-Cl, pH 8, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. These hypotonic cell extracts could be stored at −80 °C. For the enzyme assay, 20 μl of the thawed extract was added to a 200-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8, and 50 μm NGD. The production of the fluorescent cGDPR was measured fluorimetrically (excitation wavelength, 300 nm; emission wavelength, 405 nm) using a fluorescence plate reader and calibrated by with known concentrations of cGDPR (21Graeff R.M. Mehta K. Lee H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 722-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were measured over several hours at 25 °C, and the rates of cGDPR production were determined from the slopes of fluorescence increase and expressed as nmol of cGDPR formed per 106 cells. Morpholino antisense oligonucleotides have been recently designed to overcome some of the known limitations of regular antisense oligonucleotides. Morpholinos are assembled from four subunits, each of which contains one of the four bases linked to a six-membered morpholine ring. The subunits are joined in a specific order by nonionic phosphorodiamidate linkages. Applications of morpholino antisense oligonucleotides in different species indicate that it has improved specificity and stability against nucleases (reviewed in Refs. 27Kipshidze N. Moses J. Shankar L.R. Leon M. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2001; 3: 265-277PubMed Google Scholar and 28Iversen P.L. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2001; 3: 235-238PubMed Google Scholar). Morpholino antisense and sense oligonucleotides were synthesized by Gene Tools (Philomath, OR) to target a sequence residing in the 69 bases of the 5′ cap of human CD38 mRNA (GenBankTMaccession number M34461) (29Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2811-2815PubMed Google Scholar). We selected the sequence 5′-GGTTGGCTGGGCGAAGATGAGGC-3′, which starts 37 bases upstream of AUG and 32 bases into the 5′ cap. The sequence has minimal secondary structure and the lowest self-complementarity, based upon the GC content. The invert of the antisense (sense) (5′-GCCTCATCTTCGCCCAGCCAACC-3′) was used as the control. A short stretch of each morpholino oligonucleotide (5 bases at the 3′ end) was paired to complementary DNA, and an extra 10 bases of the DNA was added to form a 5′ overhang. The DNA acts as an “adaptor” and binds electrostatically to the delivery reagent, a weakly basic ethoxylated polyethylenimine reagent (Gene Tools). Equimolar concentrations (1.4 μm) of the oligonucleotides and ethoxylated polyethylenimine were first combined and incubated at room temperature for 20 min, following which, serum-free RPMI medium (Invitrogen) was added. HL60 cells were suspended in this solution at 1.0 × 106/ml and incubated at 37 °C in a 10% CO2atmosphere for 3 h. The cells were then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min, resuspended in RPMI with 10% serum at 0.2 × 106/ml, and returned to the incubator. Following a 24-h treatment with the oligonucleotides, RA (1.0 μm, Sigma) was added, and the cells were harvested for analysis 3 days later. Down-regulation of CD38 was facilitated by using the following primers targeting two separate coding regions of CD38 mRNA: region 3 sense primer, 5′-CTCTGTCTTGGCGTCAGTATTcctgtctc-3′; region 3 antisense primer, 5′-TACTGACGCCAAGACAGAGTTcctgtctc-3′; region 27 sense primer, 5′-AGGACTGCAGCAACAACCCTTcctgtctc-3′; and region 27 antisense primer, 5′-GGGTTGTTGCTGCAGTCCTTTcctgtctc-3′. The two regions start 70 and 533 bases downstream of ATG, respectively. Bases indicated by capital letters correspond to the region in the CD38 mRNA, while the 8-nucleotide stretch at the 3′ end, in lowercase letters, is required for the T7 promoter primer sequence, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGgagacagg-3′, to hybridize to the sense and antisense primers for transcription. The two thymidines, in italics, are needed for the stability of the siRNA (30Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). The HiScribe RNAi transcription kit from New England BioLabs was used to synthesize the double-stranded siRNA. Following synthesis, the siRNA was purified twice by ethanol precipitation and dissolved in sterile RNase-free water. Transfection of HL60 cells was facilitated by theTransIT-TKO Transfection Reagent (Mirus Corporation, Madison, WI). 24 μl of the TKO reagent was first incubated with 100 μl of OPTIMEM-I medium (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 15 min before siRNA was added. After another 15 min at room temperature, 500 μl of RPMI 1640 (with 10% calf serum) containing 0.8 × 106 cells was added. The final siRNA concentration was 125 nm, and the incubation proceeded for 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, after which 3.5 ml of RPMI 1640 (with 10% calf serum) was added, and the incubation continued at 37 °C for 24 h. RA was added to a final concentration of 1.0 μm, and the cells were harvested 72 h later for analyses. The system was from Clontech and contains two components. The first is the pTet-On vector, which directs the expression of a regulatory protein, the reverse tetracyclin-controlled transactivator. The second is the pBI vector, which contains a bidirectional promoter, a tetracycline-responsive element flanked by two identical promoters in opposite orientations, allowing two genes of interest, CD38 and green fluorescent protein in our case, to be regulated by the tetracycline-responsive element. The inclusion of the green fluorescent protein was intended to facilitate monitoring of transfection and for selection of transfected clones. Cationic liposomes were used for transfecting HL60 cells with the pTet-On plasmid. DC-Cholesterol, l-α-dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine, and diphytanoyl phosphatidylethanolamine were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Formulations used were 1:1 and 1:3 (molar ratio) of l-α-dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine/DC-cholesterol and diphytanoyl phosphatidylethanolamine/DC-cholesterol. 5 mg of total lipid of each formulation were dried down and resuspended in 250 μl of distilled H2O, followed by 5 min of sonication. 250 μl of 2× phosphate-buffered saline, pH. 7.4, was added, and the liposomes were further sonicated for 3 min. 5 μl of the liposomal suspension was diluted in 50 μl of OPTIMEM-I medium and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. 1.2 μg of theScaI-digested pTet-On plasmid was diluted in 50 μl of OPTIMEM-I medium. The DNA and liposomal dilutions were combined in equal volumes and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. HL-60 cells (8 × 104) in 500 μl of OPTIMEM-I medium was added and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Afterward, 5 ml of RPMI 1640 (with 10% fetal calf serum) was added, and the transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C. After two cell divisions (48 h), the cells were resuspended in 5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium at a density of 2.0 × 104/ml with 380 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), the selection antibiotic. The medium was replaced every 5 days. The cells stably expressing reverse tetracyclin-controlled transactivator were obtained after repeated selection with G418. Over the next 9 weeks the cells were passaged 12 times until there were virtually no dead cells in the cultures. Control experiments show that these stably transfected cells differentiate normally in response to RA. At that point a portion of the cells was frozen, and the remaining cells were used for the next transfection. All of the subsequent incubations were carried out in the presence of 380 μg/ml G418 in the medium. A pBI plasmid containing both green fluorescent protein and a full-length CD38. cDNA encoding for the full-length CD38 was inserted into the one of the two multiple of the pBI plasmid at theMluI and NheI restriction sites. The green fluorescent protein cDNA was spliced into the other cloning site at the SalI and PstI restriction sites. HL60 cells were co-transfected with the construct and the pTK-Hyg (Clontech) plasmid; the latter allowed positive selection using hygromycin. HL-60 cells containing the pTet-On vector were transfected with the construct using cationic liposomes as described above, and the positive clones were selected using 200 μg/ml hygromycin. Treatment of HL-60 cells with RA induces differentiation into granulocytes (22Collins S.J. Blood. 1987; 70: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which possess many of the functional characteristics of normal peripheral blood granulocytes, including phagocytosis and chemotaxis. The underlying mechanism is largely unknown. During phagocytosis, rapid generation of superoxide anion occurs, which can be conveniently monitored with NBT. It is a water-soluble dye, which is converted to insoluble intracellular blue formazan by phagocytizing neutrophils, a reaction mediated by superoxide (31Collins S.J. Ruscetti F.W. Gallagher R.E. Gallo R.C. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 149: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 32Breitman T.R. Selonick S.E. Collins S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2936-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar). Differentiated cells that are phagocytizing are thus stained blue and black, whereas undifferentiated cells are not stained. The NBT reaction can also be monitored in cell suspensions by measuring the increase in absorbance at 590 nm. Differentiated cells produce greatly increased NBT reaction as compared with control cells. Either the absorbance changes or direct counting of NBT staining cells was used for quantifying granulocytic differentiation. We and others have shown that accompanying differentiation, RA also induces expression of CD38 in HL-60 cells (19Takahashi K. Kukimoto I. Tokita K. Inageda K. Inoue S. Kontani K. Hoshino S.

Commun. 1994; 205: 722-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which can be conveniently measured by using FACS analyses or by measuring the ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity of CD38 in cell extracts using the NGD technique (21Graeff R.M. Mehta K. Lee H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 722-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CD38 cyclizes NGD, a nonfluorescent substrate analog of NAD, to cGDPR, a fluorescent product, which can be measured fluorimetrically. It is generally believed that CD38 is an antigen and is mainly expressed on the cell surface. Fig.1 A shows immunofluorescence localization of CD38 in the differentiated cells. Intact cells (− Triton) showed ring-like immunostaining as revealed by confocal fluorescence microscopy, consistent with surface expression. Permeabilization with a detergent, Triton, before staining allowed internal access and resulted in even more intense staining that exhibited prominent intracellular structures (Fig. 1 B). The RA-induced expression of CD38 is thus not limited to the cell surface but intracellularly throughout the cells as well, appropriate for a signaling role. This is supported by measuring the cellular accumulation of its enzymatic product, cADPR, as shown in Fig.2. At various times after RA induction, aliquots of the culture were assayed for the enzymatic activity of CD38 (Fig. 2 A), cellular contents of cADPR (Fig. 2 B), and differentiation (Fig. 2 C). Parallel cultures without the RA treatment served as control. As seen, intracellular cADPR levels in the cells elevated progressively with a time course slightly lagging behind the appearance of CD38 activity (19Takahashi K. Kukimoto I. Tokita K. Inageda K. Inoue S. Kontani K. Hoshino S. Nishina H. Kanaho Y. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Both CD38 expression and cADPR accumulation, however, preceded cellular differentiation by more than 20 h, consistent with a causal role. If this were the case, inhibition of CD38 expression should lead to inhibition of differentiation. Nicotinamide has been used as a cell-permeant inhibitor of the NAD cyclization activity of CD38. Mechanistically, nicotinamide actually forces the reverse of the cyclase reaction and produces NAD from cADPR (10Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 25Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 33Kim H. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Science. 1993; 261: 1330-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). HL-60 cells were induced with RA and nicotinamide was added at 24 or 48 h afterward (indicated by arrows in Fig. 3), and endogenous cADPR levels were measured at 72 h after induction. As can be seen in Fig. 3 A, nicotinamide produced partial inhibition of the CD38 activity. Because the cells were washed to remove nicotinamide before the extracts were prepared, the observed inhibition actually reflected the reduction of CD38 expression. This was surprising, but the results were confirmed by using FACS analyses as shown in the inset in Fig.3 A. Treatment with nicotinamide (20 mm) during the RA induction resulted in most cells exhibiting less CD38 fluorescence. The cellular cADPR levels exhibited similar changes to those of the CD38 activity as shown in Fig. 3 B. The extent of reduction in cADPR levels appeared more pronounced than the CD38 activity, and the levels were reduced close to the basal levels of the control cells without the RA treatment. This is likely to be due to the combined effects of the inhibition of the cyclase activity of CD38 by nicotinamide as well as the actual reduction in CD38 expression in the cells. Parallel to the reduction in cADPR and CD38, there was corresponding inhibition of cellular differentiation as shown in Fig.3 C. The inhibitory effect of nicotinamide was specific for differentiation because the treated cells were not only viable throughout the 72 h of incubation but also proliferated equally well as compared with control cells not treated with the inhibitor. Furthermore, the NAD content of the cells actually doubled, from 0.35 ± 0.05 to 0.70 ± 0.01 nmol/106 cells, after 72 h of treatment with nicotinamide, indicative of the treated cell being in an energetically favorable state. A common method for suppressing expression of a protein is to use antisense oligonucleotides. Morpholino oligonucleotides represent a recent improvement of the technique and offer better specificity and stability against nucleases than regular oligonucleotides (reviewed in Refs. 27Kipshidze N. Moses J. Shankar L.R. Leon M. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2001; 3: 265-277PubMed Google Scholar and 28Iversen P.L. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2001; 3: 235-238PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that preincubation with the antisense oligonucleotides reduced both the expression of CD38 and cellular differentiation to levels similar to the control cells not treated with RA. Preincubation with the sense oligonucleotides or with just the carrier (ethoxylated polyethylenimine) affected neither the expression of CD38 nor cellular differentiation induced by RA. Similar to that described above for nicotinamide, HL-60 cells proliferated equally well in the presence of the antisense oligonucleotides as compared with control cells not treated, indicating that its inhibitory effect was specific for cellular differentiation. In addition to antisense oligonucleotide, the RNAi technique has recently been used for the same purpose (reviewed in Ref. 34Ullu E. Djikeng A. Shi H. Tschudi C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2089702328,"Statins improve vascular functions by mechanisms independent from their cholesterol-lowering effect. Rho GTPases are emerging as key targets for the vascular effects of statins. RhoB is a short-lived, early-response inducible protein involved in receptor endocytosis, apoptosis, and gene expression. Here we show that statins regulate RhoB expression by acting at multiple levels. Simvastatin increased RhoB protein levels by 8- to 10-fold. This effect was related to a depletion of isoprenoid intermediates, as deduced from the observation that several metabolites of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, namely, mevalonate and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate, attenuated simvastatin-induced RhoB up-regulation. Moreover, prenyltransferase inhibitors mimicked simvastatin effect. Cholesterol supplementation did not prevent simvastatin-elicited up-regulation but increased RhoB levels per se. Simvastatin moderately augmented RhoB transcript levels, but markedly impaired the degradation of RhoB protein, which accumulated in the cytosol in its non-isoprenylated form. Inhibition of RhoB isoprenylation was apparently required for simvastatin-induced up-regulation, because levels of an isoprenylation-deficient RhoB mutant were not affected by simvastatin. Moreover, this mutant was found to be markedly more stable than the wild-type protein. These results show that RhoB isoprenylation is necessary for rapid turnover of this protein and identify a novel link between the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and the regulation of G-protein expression.

Statins are a family of drugs widely used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. They are competitive inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) 1The abbreviations used are: HMG-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cells; GGPP, geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin1The abbreviations used are: HMG-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cells; GGPP, geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin reductase (1Goldstein J.L.

Mevalonate is also the precursor of farnesyl-pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate, the isoprenoid lipids involved in the posttranslational modification of a number of proteins, including most G-proteins (2Zhang F.L.

For this reason, statins have also been used as pharmacological tools to assess the importance of protein isoprenylation in signal transduction (4Schafer W.R. Kim R. Sterne R. Thorner J. Kim S.-H.

However, the mechanisms responsible for these effects are not fully elucidated.RhoB is a short-lived protein, the levels of which can be regulated by growth factors and stress signals both transcriptionally and posttranslationally (26Engel M.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30637-30644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). RhoB can be modified either by farnesylation or geranylgeranylation at its C terminus (20Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that its function may depend on the presence and the nature of the isoprenoid moiety (30Lebowitz P.F.

Among the reported RhoB functions are the modulation of receptor endocytosis (31Gampel A. Parker P.J. Mellor H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 955-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), apoptosis (32Liu A.-X. Cerniglia G.J. Bernhard E.J. Prendergast G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. 2000; 87: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (33Delarue F.L. Taylor B.S. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6531-6537Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A detailed knowledge of the effect of statins on Rho protein biology is of primary importance in the context of the therapeutic strategies for hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. In the present study we have explored the effect of statins on RhoB expression and processing in several cell types. Our results show that statins drastically increase the levels of cellular RhoB by mechanisms that involve the regulation of RhoB mRNA by the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and the impairment of the proteolytic degradation of the non-isoprenylated RhoB protein. This latter observation provides the first evidence for the regulation of protein stability by isoprenylation.DISCUSSIONThe results presented in this work show that RhoB levels are modulated by the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Down-regulation of this pathway either by means of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or excess cholesterol is associated with an increase in the amount of RhoB. This regulation occurs in part at the mRNA level and largely at the protein level, because inhibition of RhoB isoprenylation either by pharmacological or genetic manipulation markedly reduces the degradation of this protein.The cholesterol biosynthetic pathway provides the isoprenoid intermediates needed for the posttranslational modification of G-proteins. Although protein isoprenylation is an irreversible modification, it is susceptible to a certain degree of regulation, because the activity of the prenyltransferases may be controlled by some growth factors and by the availability of isoprenoids. The cholesterol pathway is subjected to a complex feedback regulation (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4499) Google Scholar), and it can be modulated by stress (39Shack S. Gorospe M. Fawcett T.W. Hudgins W.R. Holbrook N.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6021-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In recent years it has become evident that the activity of this pathway may control the maturation of certain G-proteins such as Ras, thus resulting in the regulation of Ras-mediated cellular processes in response to cholesterol levels or cellular stress (39Shack S. Gorospe M. Fawcett T.W. Hudgins W.R. Holbrook N.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6021-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 40Gadbut A.P. Wu L. Tang D. Papageorge A. Watson J.A. Galper J.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7250-7260Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, several lines of evidence indicate that the mevalonate pathway may influence the expression of other members of the Ras superfamily, namely Ras1 and Ras2 in yeast (23Dimster-Denk D. Schafer W.R. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and Rab5 and Rab7 in thyroid cells (24Laezza C. Bucci C. Santillo M. Bruni C.B. Bifulco M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), through mechanisms not yet completely elucidated.The relationship between G-protein expression and cholesterol metabolism may be bidirectional. In a recent report, cdc42 proteins have been involved in the regulation of cholesterol efflux (41Hirano K.-I. Matsuura F. Tsukamoto K. Zhang Z. Matsuyama A. Takaishi K. Komuro R. Suehiro T. Yamashita S. Takai Y. Matsuzawa Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, in fibroblasts from patients with the inherited disorder of lipid metabolism known as Tangier disease, characterized by cellular accumulation of cholesteryl esters, the expression of several Rho proteins, including RhoB, is increased (42Utech M. Hobbel G. Rust S. Reinecke H. Assmann G. Walter M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). On this basis, a role for Rho proteins in cholesterol transport has been hypothesized. Our results raise the possibility that the observed increase in Rho proteins expression may be caused in part by the accumulation of cholesterol in cells.The mechanisms by which the mevalonate pathway regulates RhoB appear to be multiple. Recently, mevalonate depletion has been reported to result in an increase in RhoB mRNA (25Holstein S.A. Wohlford-Lenane C.L. Hohl R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10678-10682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of isoprenoid intermediates or isoprenylated proteins in this effect has not been explored. Here we have shown that inhibition of mevalonate biosynthesis with simvastatin moderately up-regulates RhoB mRNA levels and that this effect is prevented by GGPP. In addition, we have observed that inhibition of Rho signaling by means of bacterial toxins that target and inactivate Rho proteins (43Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar) or by a Rho kinase inhibitor, is also associated with a moderate increase in RhoB protein and mRNA levels. These observations suggest that geranylgeranylated proteins and, in particular, Rho proteins, exert a negative feedback on RhoB mRNA expression in endothelial cells. This interpretation is in accordance with previous studies that identified a negative role of RhoA and B on the activity of the mouse RhoB promoter (29Fritz G. Kaina B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30637-30644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the main effect of simvastatin on RhoB expression takes place at a posttranslational level by reducing RhoB degradation. This could occur through several mechanisms. Simvastatin could affect the activity of proteolytic pathways within the cell. In fact, statins have been reported to modulate the activity of the proteasome (44Rao S. Porter D.C. Chen X. Herliczek T. Lowe M. Keyomarsi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 45Wojcik C. Bury M. Stoklosa T. Giermasz A. Feleszko W. Mlynarczuk I. Pleban E. Basak G. Omura S. Jakobisiak M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), a protein-degradation pathway proposed to mediate RhoB turnover (26Engel M.E. Datta P.K. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9921-9926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, the effect of simvastatin on RhoB levels and stability was completely prevented by co-treatment with cycloheximide, thus showing that de novo protein synthesis is required for its effect. Moreover, inhibition of protein isoprenylation by using peptidomimetic inhibitors of prenyltransferases reproduced the effect of simvastatin on RhoB levels. These observations suggest that the effect of simvastatin is related to the inhibition of protein isoprenylation rather than to a direct interference with cellular proteases. Because the increase in RhoB protein elicited by simvastatin occurs at the expense of non-prenylated cytosol-partitioned RhoB, it could be hypothesized that the immature cytosolic protein is a poorer substrate for proteases or it does not localize to the appropriate cellular compartment for degradation. This is supported by the fact that the Cys193Ser RhoB mutant, which lacks the isoprenylation site and is cytosolic, is markedly more stable than the wild-type protein. These observations indicate that isoprenylation of RhoB determines the half-life of the protein. Interestingly, carboxyl methylation of the isoprenylated cysteine in RhoA has been reported to reduce its turnover (46Backlund P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33175-33180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), thus providing another example of the regulation of Rho protein stability as a function of their posttranslational processing.Whether the increased stability of unprenylated RhoB is caused by changes in subcellular distribution, activity, or ability to interact with other cellular proteins will be the subject of further studies. Although inhibition of RhoB isoprenylation may abolish some of RhoB functions, like its cell transforming ability (47Lebowitz P.F. Du W. Prendergast G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16093-16095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or the activation of the endothelin-1 promoter (10Hernández-Perera O. Pérez-Sala D. Soria E. Lamas S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), other functions could be conserved, as it has been described for the activation of the serum-response element-dependent transcription in overexpression experiments (47Lebowitz P.F. Du W. Prendergast G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16093-16095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Future work will address whether unprenylated RhoB may have specific functions or whether it behaves as a dominant-negative RhoB protein.In conclusion, we have found that RhoB mRNA levels and protein stability can be regulated by the availability of isoprenoid intermediates needed for protein modification. These findings unveil the novel role of isoprenylation in the control of RhoB protein degradation and may contribute to the understanding of the complex structure-function relationships of RhoB posttranslational modifications. Statins are a family of drugs widely used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. They are competitive inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) 1The abbreviations used are: HMG-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cells; GGPP, geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin1The abbreviations used are: HMG-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cells; GGPP, geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin reductase (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4499) Google Scholar), the enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of cholesterol, that is, the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate (Scheme FS1). Mevalonate is also the precursor of farnesyl-pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate, the isoprenoid lipids involved in the posttranslational modification of a number of proteins, including most G-proteins (2Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 3Rando R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1300: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For this reason, statins have also been used as pharmacological tools to assess the importance of protein isoprenylation in signal transduction (4Schafer W.R. Kim R. Sterne R. Thorner J. Kim S.-H.

A. 2001; 98: 6192-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and vascular gene expression, including that of pre-pro-endothelin-1 (10Hernández-Perera O. Pérez-Sala D. Soria E. Lamas S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (33Delarue F.L. Taylor B.S. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6531-6537Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A detailed knowledge of the effect of statins on Rho protein biology is of primary importance in the context of the therapeutic strategies for hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. In the present study we have explored the effect of statins on RhoB expression and processing in several cell types. Our results show that statins drastically increase the levels of cellular RhoB by mechanisms that involve the regulation of RhoB mRNA by the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and the impairment of the proteolytic degradation of the non-isoprenylated RhoB protein. This latter observation provides the first evidence for the regulation of protein stability by isoprenylation. DISCUSSIONThe results presented in this work show that RhoB levels are modulated by the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Down-regulation of this pathway either by means of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or excess cholesterol is associated with an increase in the amount of RhoB. This regulation occurs in part at the mRNA level and largely at the protein level, because inhibition of RhoB isoprenylation either by pharmacological or genetic manipulation markedly reduces the degradation of this protein.The cholesterol biosynthetic pathway provides the isoprenoid intermediates needed for the posttranslational modification of G-proteins. Although protein isoprenylation is an irreversible modification, it is susceptible to a certain degree of regulation, because the activity of the prenyltransferases may be controlled by some growth factors and by the availability of isoprenoids. The cholesterol pathway is subjected to a complex feedback regulation (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4499) Google Scholar), and it can be modulated by stress (39Shack S. Gorospe M. Fawcett T.W. Hudgins W.R. Holbrook N.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6021-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In recent years it has become evident that the activity of this pathway may control the maturation of certain G-proteins such as Ras, thus resulting in the regulation of Ras-mediated cellular processes in response to cholesterol levels or cellular stress (39Shack S. Gorospe M. Fawcett T.W. Hudgins W.R. Holbrook N.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6021-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 40Gadbut A.P. Wu L. Tang D. Papageorge A. Watson J.A. Galper J.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7250-7260Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, several lines of evidence indicate that the mevalonate pathway may influence the expression of other members of the Ras superfamily, namely Ras1 and Ras2 in yeast (23Dimster-Denk D. Schafer W.R. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and Rab5 and Rab7 in thyroid cells (24Laezza C. Bucci C. Santillo M. Bruni C.B. Bifulco M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), through mechanisms not yet completely elucidated.The relationship between G-protein expression and cholesterol metabolism may be bidirectional. In a recent report, cdc42 proteins have been involved in the regulation of cholesterol efflux (41Hirano K.-I. Matsuura F. Tsukamoto K. Zhang Z. Matsuyama A. Takaishi K. Komuro R. Suehiro T. Yamashita S. Takai Y. Matsuzawa Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, in fibroblasts from patients with the inherited disorder of lipid metabolism known as Tangier disease, characterized by cellular accumulation of cholesteryl esters, the expression of several Rho proteins, including RhoB, is increased (42Utech M. Hobbel G. Rust S. Reinecke H. Assmann G. Walter M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). On this basis, a role for Rho proteins in cholesterol transport has been hypothesized. Our results raise the possibility that the observed increase in Rho proteins expression may be caused in part by the accumulation of cholesterol in cells.The mechanisms by which the mevalonate pathway regulates RhoB appear to be multiple. Recently, mevalonate depletion has been reported to result in an increase in RhoB mRNA (25Holstein S.A. Wohlford-Lenane C.L. Hohl R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10678-10682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of isoprenoid intermediates or isoprenylated proteins in this effect has not been explored. Here we have shown that inhibition of mevalonate biosynthesis with simvastatin moderately up-regulates RhoB mRNA levels and that this effect is prevented by GGPP. In addition, we have observed that inhibition of Rho signaling by means of bacterial toxins that target and inactivate Rho proteins (43Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar) or by a Rho kinase inhibitor, is also associated with a moderate increase in RhoB protein and mRNA levels. These observations suggest that geranylgeranylated proteins and, in particular, Rho proteins, exert a negative feedback on RhoB mRNA expression in endothelial cells. This interpretation is in accordance with previous studies that identified a negative role of RhoA and B on the activity of the mouse RhoB promoter (29Fritz G. Kaina B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30637-30644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the main effect of simvastatin on RhoB expression takes place at a posttranslational level by reducing RhoB degradation. This could occur through several mechanisms. Simvastatin could affect the activity of proteolytic pathways within the cell. In fact, statins have been reported to modulate the activity of the proteasome (44Rao S. Porter D.C. Chen X. Herliczek T. Lowe M. Keyomarsi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 45Wojcik C. Bury M. Stoklosa T. Giermasz A. Feleszko W. Mlynarczuk I. Pleban E. Basak G. Omura S. Jakobisiak M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), a protein-degradation pathway proposed to mediate RhoB turnover (26Engel M.E. Datta P.K. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9921-9926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, the effect of simvastatin on RhoB levels and stability was completely prevented by co-treatment with cycloheximide, thus showing that de novo protein synthesis is required for its effect. Moreover, inhibition of protein isoprenylation by using peptidomimetic inhibitors of prenyltransferases reproduced the effect of simvastatin on RhoB levels. These observations suggest that the effect of simvastatin is related to the inhibition of protein isoprenylation rather than to a direct interference with cellular proteases. Because the increase in RhoB protein elicited by simvastatin occurs at the expense of non-prenylated cytosol-partitioned RhoB, it could be hypothesized that the immature cytosolic protein is a poorer substrate for proteases or it does not localize to the appropriate cellular compartment for degradation. This is supported by the fact that the Cys193Ser RhoB mutant, which lacks the isoprenylation site and is cytosolic, is markedly more stable than the wild-type protein. These observations indicate that isoprenylation of RhoB determines the half-life of the protein. Interestingly, carboxyl methylation of the isoprenylated cysteine in RhoA has been reported to reduce its turnover (46Backlund P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33175-33180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), thus providing another example of the regulation of Rho protein stability as a function of their posttranslational processing.Whether the increased stability of unprenylated RhoB is caused by changes in subcellular distribution, activity, or ability to interact with other cellular proteins will be the subject of further studies. Although inhibition of RhoB isoprenylation may abolish some of RhoB functions, like its cell transforming ability (47Lebowitz P.F. Du W. Prendergast G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16093-16095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or the activation of the endothelin-1 promoter (10Hernández-Perera O. Pérez-Sala D. Soria E. Lamas S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), other functions could be conserved, as it has been described for the activation of the serum-response element-dependent transcription in overexpression experiments (47Lebowitz P.F. Du W. Prendergast G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16093-16095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Future work will address whether unprenylated RhoB may have specific functions or whether it behaves as a dominant-negative RhoB protein.In conclusion, we have found that RhoB mRNA levels and protein stability can be regulated by the availability of isoprenoid intermediates needed for protein modification. These findings unveil the novel role of isoprenylation in the control of RhoB protein degradation and may contribute to the understanding of the complex structure-function relationships of RhoB posttranslational modifications. The results presented in this work show that RhoB levels are modulated by the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2058712144,"The morbidity and mortality associated with Escherichia coli K1 meningitis during the neonatal period have remained significant over the last decade and are once again on the rise. Transcytosis of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) by E. coli within an endosome to avoid lysosomal fusion is crucial for dissemination into the central nervous system. Central to E. coli internalization of BMEC is the expression of OmpA (outer membrane protein A), which interacts with its receptor for the actin reorganization that leads to invasion. However, nothing is known about the nature of the signaling events for the formation of endosomes containing E. coli K1. We show here that E. coli K1 infection of human BMEC (HBMEC) results in activation of caveolin-1 for bacterial uptake via caveolae. The interaction of caveolin-1 with phosphorylated protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) at the E. coli attachment site is critical for the invasion of HBMEC. Optical sectioning of confocal images of infected HBMEC indicates continuing association of caveolin-1 with E. coli during transcytosis. Overexpression of a dominant-negative form of caveolin-1 containing mutations in the scaffolding domain blocked the interaction of phospho-PKCalpha with caveolin-1 and the E. coli invasion of HBMEC, but not actin cytoskeleton rearrangement or the phosphorylation of PKCalpha. The interaction of caveolin-1 with phospho-PKCalpha was completely abrogated in HBMEC overexpressing dominant-negative forms of either focal adhesion kinase or PKCalpha. Treatment of HBMEC with a cell-permeable peptide that represents the scaffolding domain, which was coupled to an antennapedia motif of a Drosophila transcription factor significantly blocked the interaction of caveolin-1 with phospho-PKCalpha and E. coli invasion. These results show that E. coli K1 internalizes HBMEC via caveolae and that the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 plays a significant role in the formation of endosomes."

It is highly glycosylated, with multiple isoforms and glycoforms expressed on the cell surface depending on the cell type and stage of differentiation. Interestingly, we found two pools of newly synthesized CD45 expressed on plasma membrane, one of which arrived by 5 min after synthesis. The remaining pool of CD45 was fully glycosylated and began to arrive at the cell surface at ∼15 min. The rapidly expressed population of CD45 possessed exclusively endoglycosidase H-sensitiveN-linked carbohydrate. Additionally, this rapidly expressed pool of CD45 appeared on the cell surface in a brefeldin A (BFA)-insensitive manner, suggesting that it reached the cell surface independent of the Golgi complex. The remaining CD45 trafficked through the Golgi complex, and transport proceeded via a BFA-sensitive mechanism. These data suggest that CD45 is able to reach the cell surface via two distinct routes. The first is a conventional Golgi-dependent pathway that allows fully processed CD45 to be expressed. The second utilizes an ill defined mechanism that is independent of the Golgi, is BFA-resistant, and allows for the expression of CD45 with immature carbohydrate on the cell surface.

Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). CD45 exerts its effects, at least in part, by regulating the phosphorylation state of Src family kinases through the dephosphorylation of a negative regulatory carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residue (3Thomas M.L. Brown E.J. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 406-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 4Ashwell J.D. D'Oro U. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 412-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition to the cytoplasmic phosphatase domains, CD45 contains a large extracellular region. Three alternatively spliced exons reside within the external domain of CD45 and contain numerous sites for potentialO-linked carbohydrate additions. These exons are developmentally regulated with respect to usage in T cells; and therefore, cells at different developmental stages have the potential to express vastly different forms of CD45. In addition to theO-linked carbohydrate found in the alternatively spliced sequences, there are numerous potential N-linked carbohydrate attachment sites (5Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 339-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These N-linked carbohydrate additions have been demonstrated to be important for both cell-surface expression and stability of CD45 (6Pulido R. Sanchez-Madrid F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently shown that the composition of the CD45 N-linked carbohydrate is developmentally regulated, possibly through the action of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 enzyme glucosidase II (GII) (7Baldwin T.A. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3829-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, no typical cell-surface ligand for the extracellular domain of CD45 has been identified; however, several lectins have been demonstrated to bind CD45 carbohydrate (7Baldwin T.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4581-4584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The intracellular transport of proteins from the ER to the cell surface is a tightly controlled process involving the coordinated action of many enzymes and proteins (13Lippincott-Schwartz J. Roberts T.H. Hirschberg K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 557-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). For the most part, as a protein moves through the secretory pathway, a level of control is exerted at each stage of the transport process, from protein folding and vesicle budding at the ER to movement through the Golgi stacks and finally sorting at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) en route to its final destination (14Roche P.A. Immunity. 1999; 11: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In many cases, this regulation is necessary for proper function of the protein. For example, transport of Class I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen-presenting proteins as well as CD1 follows different routes to the cell surface, and those specific routes are necessary to ensure that the appropriate antigens are loaded into their peptide- or glycolipid-binding grooves (15Briken V.

For CD45, it is clear that cell-surface expression is required for proper function and that the N-linked carbohydrate on CD45 plays a role in this process (6Pulido R. Sanchez-Madrid F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recently, mannose-binding lectin has been shown to bind cell-surface CD45, which indicates that CD45 is able to escape complete carbohydrate processing, leaving immature, high mannose carbohydrate (7Baldwin T.A.

Nature. 2001; 409: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar), as well as the limited information on CD45 trafficking in general, we set out to determine the overall trafficking patterns of CD45. By examining the transport of CD45 to the plasma membrane, we hoped to gain insight into the mechanism of expression of CD45 bearing mannose-binding lectin ligands. Our results indicate that there is a pool of CD45 that is very rapidly expressed on the cell surface after synthesis. It appears that two different mechanisms exist that allow CD45 to reach the cell surface: one involving the Golgi complex, resulting in endoglycosidase H (Endo H)-resistant carbohydrate modification; and the other independent of the Golgi, resulting in the maintenance of exclusively Endo H-sensitive carbohydrate on the cell surface. These data support the existence of a transport pathway where cargo can reach the cell surface extremely rapidly, without the requirement of the Golgi complex. The T lymphoma cell line BW5147 (referred to below as BW) was maintained as previously described (23Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol.

Rabbit antisera H2 and J37, specific for GIIβ and the intracellular region of CD45, respectively, were previously described (26Baldwin T.A. Gogela-Spehar M. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 1753-1757PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-GIIα antiserum was purchased from Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp. (Vancouver). Cell-surface biotinylation was performed as previously described (7Baldwin T.A. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3829-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were biotinylated with 50 μl of 10 mm sulfosuccinimidobiotin (Pierce)/5 × 107 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min on ice. Reactions were quenched by washing cells twice with PBS containing 5 mm glycine. All cells were lysed at a density of 5 × 107/ml in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Pierce)/Tris-buffered saline buffer (lysis buffer) and incubated for 20 min on ice. Post-nuclear supernatants were incubated with I3/2-coupled Sepharose 4B for 1–2 h or with 10 μl/ml rabbit antiserum, followed by capture of the immune complexes with protein A-Sepharose 4B. Biotinylated proteins were isolated by incubation with streptavidin-agarose for 1–2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates and streptavidin pull-downs were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. After washing, the immunoprecipitates were boiled in reducing sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates were treated with Endo H (Calbiochem) in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol for 16 h at 33 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS prior to depletion of intracellular methionine by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C with methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen). Cells were then pulsed for 10 min at 15 °C or for 5 min at 37 °C (pulse conditions are indicated for each figure) with 0.5 mCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN Biomedicals) at 5 × 107/ml. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold unlabeled complete medium (containing methionine) prior to initiation of the chase. Cells were chased at 37 °C (or as indicated) in complete medium, followed by washing with PBS prior to lysis. Where indicated, the chase medium was supplemented with 10 mm methionine. All cells were kept on ice after the chase prior to isolation of the cell-surface protein as described below to prevent antibody or biotin internalization. For specific isolation of cell-surface proteins, either an antibody or biotinylation method was employed. For isolation of cell-surface protein by the antibody method, cells were incubated for 20 min with 20 μg/ml I3/2 or 10 μl/ml rabbit antiserum at 4 °C, followed by washing three times with PBS. Cells (5 × 106) were then lysed with 500 μl of 2.5 × 107/ml unlabeled lysate. Immune complexes were recovered with secondary antibody-coated protein A-Sepharose 4B. For isolation of cell-surface CD45 by biotinylation, cells were surface-biotinylated as described above and lysed at 2.5 × 107/ml in lysis buffer, followed by total CD45 immunoprecipitation. Captured CD45 was released by boiling for 2 × 5 min in 50 μl of 2% SDS-containing Tris-buffered saline. Eluent was diluted to 1 ml with lysis buffer. Biotinylated CD45 was isolated with immobilized streptavidin as described above. Cell-surface proteins were selectively isolated by the antibody method unless otherwise stated. All immunoprecipitates and pull-downs were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer prior to boiling with reducing sample buffer. In the cases where brefeldin A (BFA) was used to block protein trafficking, cells were preincubated with 2 μg/ml BFA for 30 min at 37 °C. BFA was also present during the pulse-chase at 2 μg/ml. Proteins were resolved on polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon (polyvinylidene difluoride; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) as described previously (23Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2313-2319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For separation under nonreducing conditions, 2-mercaptoethanol was omitted from the sample buffer. Autoradiography was performed with the BioMax TranScreen intensifying system (Eastman Kodak Co.). Western blot analysis was conducted with the indicated antiserum followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (Pierce) and visualized by ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Densitometry was performed using NIH Image Version 1.62 software. Cells (1 × 106) were incubated with 10 μl/ml antiserum H2 for 20 min on ice, followed by two washes with PBS containing 0.1% serum. For detection of bound antibody, cells were further incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody for an additional 20 min on ice. Cells were then fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde before analysis. Because CD45 is capable of reaching the cell surface with incompletely processed carbohydrate (7Baldwin T.A. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3829-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 12Uemura K. Yokota Y. Kozutsumi Y. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4581-4584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we wished to follow the processing of CD45 carbohydrate through the secretory pathway using the acquisition of Endo H resistance as a marker of protein location. Treatment of newly synthesized CD45 with Endo H after various chase times indicated that CD45 began to acquire Endo H resistance ∼15 min after synthesis and that 80% of newly synthesized CD45 was Endo H-resistant after 60 min (Fig. 1). Class I MHC showed a lag period before acquiring Endo H resistance (Fig. 1). This lag phase in glycoprotein trafficking seen with Class I MHC may reflect the requirement for peptide loading, β2-microglobulin association, and transport to the Golgi before Class I begins to achieve Endo H resistance. It should be noted at this point that CD45 never achieved full Endo H resistance, with ∼50% of its carbohydrate remaining Endo H-sensitive (Fig. 1). In addition to determining the rate of acquisition of Endo H resistance, another key parameter in the trafficking of CD45 is the time required to reach the cell surface. By ascertaining the time required to reach the plasma membrane, we can observe whether or not CD45 traffics directly from the Golgi to the cell surface, or if a route through other compartments occurs. Initial experiments performed to address the time required for newly synthesized CD45 to reach the plasma membrane indicated that a population of newly synthesized CD45 was able to traffic to the surface during a 5-min pulse at 37 °C (data not shown). This time to cell-surface expression seems to be extremely rapid compared with the kinetics reported for the majority of other cell-surface proteins. However, Nori and Stallcup (28Nori M. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) used CD45 as a control in a pulse-chase experiment and reported similar results with respect to rapid CD45 cell-surface expression. To more accurately determine the time required for newly synthesized CD45 to reach the cell surface, a modification to the previous pulse-chase protocol was necessary. A pulse condition was needed that prevented or substantially slowed bulk protein transport, but still allowed for sufficient incorporation of metabolic label. Incubation of cells at 15 °C has previously been demonstrated to block protein transport at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (29Saraste J. Kuismanen E. Cell. 1984; 38: 535-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar); therefore, pulsing cells with [35S]methionine at 15 °C instead of 37 °C should slow protein transport enough to reveal a true zero chase time for cell-surface expression. Using this new protocol, no radiolabeled CD45 was detected on the cell surface at time 0 (Fig. 2 A). By 5 min, a lower molecular weight population of newly synthesized CD45 appeared at the plasma membrane, whereas a higher molecular weight population reached the cell surface at ∼15 min. The amount of newly synthesized, higher molecular weight CD45 isolated from the cell surface increased through 60 min, whereas the amount of the lower molecular weight population remained fairly constant after 15 min. As determined by densitometric analysis, at 60 min, the lower molecular weight population of newly synthesized cell-surface CD45 composed ∼20% of the total newly synthesized cell-surface material; and in examining the steady-state levels of surface CD45, the lower form was ∼20% of the total (Fig. 2 A). We also observed that the total amount of newly synthesized CD45 increased over the chase time, which raises the possibility that labeled CD45 continues to be synthesized over the chase or that, because the antibody used to isolate CD45 is conformation-dependent, this increase may reflect an increase in the amount of folded CD45. Because the inclusion of 10 mm methionine during the chase did not prevent the increase in labeled CD45 isolated over the chase (Fig. 2 A,expt. 2), we suspect that the increase in labeled CD45 recovered is due to an increased ability of the antibody to recognize CD45 over the chase time. It still remains possible that, during the cell-surface isolation of newly synthesized CD45, we were recovering internal pools of labeled CD45 nonspecifically. This may be particularly problematic at the early time points. For a number of reasons, we feel that this possibility is unlikely. Perhaps the most compelling argument against this possibility is that, using the same isolation protocol with a fibroblast cell line transfected with CD45, we were unable to recover newly synthesized cell-surface CD45 until 30 min, even though a significant amount of newly synthesized CD45 could be recovered over the chase time (Fig. 2 B). In fact, with this cell line, cells were pulsed for 5 min at 37 °C before initiating the chase; and even with this pulse procedure, a rapidly expressed population of CD45 was not detected (Fig. 2 B). Additionally, there appears to be only one glycoform of CD45 isolated from these cells, in contrast to the two forms isolated from the BW cell line. Furthermore, using Class I MHC as a control for the protocol, the surface expression of newly synthesized Class I MHC followed trafficking kinetics similar to those previously reported (30Williams D.B. Swiedler S.J. Hart G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Williams D.B. Borriello F. Zeff R.A. Nathenson S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4549-4560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with no newly synthesized Class I MHC being isolated from the cell surface until 30 min of chase time (Fig. 2 C). Finally, control mixing experiments in which unlabeled surface protein was isolated in the presence of labeled lysates showed that barely detectable levels of labeled material (significantly lower than the amount we detected at the early time points in Fig. 2 A) were isolated with the unlabeled cell-surface complexes (data not shown). Another published method to isolate cell-surface proteins involves surface biotinylation and isolation of the protein of interest, followed by streptavidin affinity enrichment (15Briken V. Jackman R.M. Dasgupta S. Hoening S. Porcelli S.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Hobman T.C. Woodward L. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Using the surface biotinylation approach to isolate cell-surface CD45, we obtained results similar to those attained with the surface antibody method described above (Fig. 3 A). Newly synthesized surface-biotinylated CD45 began to appear on the cell surface at 5 min and increased through to 60 min of chase time, with the existence of two different forms (Fig. 3 A). Between experiments and surface CD45 isolation protocols, the only variability in results occurred in the amount of the higher molecular weight form of CD45 isolated at 15 min. To control for possible nonspecific isolation of cell-surface CD45 by the biotinylation method, two controls were performed. First, a cytosolic protein-tyrosine kinase (Pyk-2) was immunoprecipitated from a surface-biotinylated lysate or a lysate biotinylated after detergent solubilization. Pyk-2 was found to be biotinylated only in the case where biotin was added post-lysis, not during the surface biotinylation procedure (Fig. 3 B). Second, non-biotinylated CD45 eluted from a CD45 immunoprecipitate was not captured by streptavidin-coated beads (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, it appears that there is a rapidly expressed population of CD45 in BW cells and that the mechanism used to express this form of CD45 does not exist in all cell types. Because bulk CD45 acquired Endo H resistance rapidly after synthesis and there were two different forms of CD45 expressed on the cell surface with different kinetics, we wished to determine whether both forms were in fact Endo H-resistant or if one was possibly Endo H-sensitive. To determine the carbohydrate status of the two different forms of newly synthesized cell-surface CD45, surface CD45 was isolated after pulse-chase and subjected to Endo H treatment. The rapidly expressed population of CD45 was entirely Endo H-sensitive, whereas the higher molecular weight form achieved its full Endo H resistance (Fig. 4). These data suggest that the higher molecular weight form is a mature glycoform of CD45 with fully processed carbohydrate, whereas the lower molecular weight form is an immature glycoform with unprocessed carbohydrate. Note again that the fully processed glycoform of CD45 still contains a significant fraction of Endo H-sensitive carbohydrate, but mature cell-surface CD45 always appears to contain this level of Endo H-sensitive carbohydrate in these cells (7Baldwin T.A. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3829-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The finding that CD45 was capable of reaching the cell surface without complete processing of its carbohydrate raises the question of how this material traffics from the ER to the cell surface. The prevailing model of glycoprotein transport states that once a glycoprotein leaves the ER, it is transported through the ERGIC to the Golgi, where the carbohydrate is processed to a complex form, and finally to the cell surface. Our finding that the rapidly expressed pool of CD45 reached the cell surface with exclusively unprocessed N-linked carbohydrate suggests that this pool may by-pass the Golgi entirely en route to the cell surface. One of the most well characterized and commonly used methods to inhibit protein transport through the Golgi is treatment of cells with the fungal metabolite BFA. BFA interferes with the recruitment of the ADP-ribosylation factor-1 GTPase to COPI-coated membranes, effectively blocking protein transport through the prevention of ER export and subsequent Golgi redistribution (33Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar,34Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with BFA effectively inhibited Class I MHC cell-surface expression and the trafficking of the higher molecular weight mature glycoform of CD45, indicating that the BFA-induced blockade was successful; however, it did not inhibit the transport of the rapidly expressed, lower molecular weight glycoform of CD45 to the cell surface (Fig. 5). Examination of the carbohydrate on newly synthesized CD45 after BFA treatment revealed that it contained entirely Endo H-sensitive carbohydrate, as expected (Fig. 5). These data suggest that the rapidly expressed population of CD45 reaches the cell surface independent of the Golgi complex and does not rely on a BFA-sensitive transport mechanism. As we did not observe increasing amounts of CD45 reaching the cell surface after BFA treatment, and the amount of cell-surface CD45 appeared fixed at ∼20% in the presence of BFA, the data suggest that there is an early commitment of a significant portion of CD45 to the conventional transport pathway. Apparently, once it enters the conventional pathway, CD45 cannot be expressed on the cell surface in the presence of BFA by the rapid alternative pathway. To further dissect the pathway used by the rapidly expressed pool of CD45, we took advantage of blocks at the ERGIC and TGN imposed by chasing proteins at 15 and 20 °C, respectively (29Saraste J. Kuismanen E. Cell. 1984; 38: 535-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 35Griffiths G. Pfeiffer S. Simons K. Matlin K. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 949-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 36Griffiths G. Simons K. Science. 1986; 234: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Performing the chase at 15 °C resulted in delayed and reduced expression of the lower molecular weight form of CD45, whereas this treatment completely prevented the surface expression of the higher molecular weight form of CD45 and Class I MHC, indicating that the blockade was successful (Fig. 6 A). Chasing cells at 20 °C after pulsing at 15 °C and isolation of cell-surface CD45 resulted in the appearance of the lower molecular weight form of CD45 beginning at 15 min and increasing through the entire chase time (Fig. 6 B). By chasing at 20 °C, both the higher molecular weight form of CD45 and Class I MHC were prevented from reaching the plasma membrane, indicating that the kinetic block was functional (Fig. 6 B). Examination of the remaining CD45 after the chase at 15 or 20 °C revealed that it still contained predominantly Endo H-sensitive carbohydrate (Fig. 6, A and B). The observation of reduced kinetics of acquisition of Endo H resistance is in accordance with previously published data (35Griffiths G. Pfeiffer S. Simons K. Matlin K. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 949-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that a block of glycoprotein traffic through thecis-Golgi or at the TGN does not prevent the expression of the lower molecular weight form of CD45, but it does appear to delay its trafficking kinetics. Because CD45 and GII associate stably in the BW cells used for this study and a number of other putative resident ER proteins have been found on the cell surface of numerous cell types (37Arosa F.A. de Jesus O.

After activation of FX, the light chain (18 kDa) containing the Gla and two epidermal growth factor-like domains remains associated via a disulfide bridge to the heavy chain (27 kDa) composed of the serine-protease domain (15Steinberg M. Nemerson Y. Hemostasis and Thrombosis. 2nd Ed. Lippincott, Philadelphia1987: 112-119Google Scholar, 16McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Sasagawa T. Howald W.N. Kwa E.Y. Weinstein B. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2875-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Even though the kinetics of the prothrombinase complex have been well characterized, surprisingly little is known about structure-function relationships of the complex and the sites of protein-protein interaction between FVa and FXa. Two regions in the A2 domain of FVa, 493–506 (17Heeb M.J. Kojima Y. Hackeng T.M. Griffin J.H. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1883-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and 311–325 (18Kojima Y. Heeb M.J. Gale A.J. Hackeng T.M. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14900-14905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), have, based on peptide studies, been suggested to be important for binding of FXa. In addition, removal of the C-terminal region of the A2 domain, 684–709, has been shown to result in reduced FXa affinity (19Bakker H.M. Tans G. Thomassen M.C. Yukelson L.Y. Ebberink R. Hemker H.C. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20662-20667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the FVa·FXa complex, extensive interaction studies have been carried out on the structurally and functionally homologous FVIIIa·FIXa complex. Various interaction sites for FIXa have been identified on FVIIIa. Three of these binding sites, comprising residues 511–530, 558–565, and 692–710, are located in the A2 domain (20Celie P.H. Van Stempvoort G. Jorieux S. Mazurier C. Van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 106: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 21O'Brien L.M. Medved L.V. Fay P.J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, a FIXa binding sequence, including residues 1811–1818 in the A3 domain of the FVIIIa light chain, has also been identified previously (23Lenting P.J. van de Loo J.W. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1935-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To map the regions on FVa that are important for binding of FXa, targeted glycosylation created by site-directed mutagenesis was used as the experimental strategy. It has been shown that mutations aiming at introduction of N-linked glycosylation at selected residues can be a useful way to probe molecular regions involved in protein-protein interaction (24Ueda T. Iwashita H. Hashimoto Y. Imoto T. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Cook B.C. Rudolph A.E. Kurumbail R.G. Porsche-Sorbet R. Miletich J.P. J. Biol.

Blood. 1998; 91: 538-548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The size of a carbohydrate chain is convenient for searching binding site regions, because it probes larger areas than can be achieved via amino acid scanning, while it is more directed than peptide or antibody inhibition studies. The targeted glycosylation was achieved by introduction of the sequence signaling for N-linked glycosylation, Asn-X-Thr. Threonine rather than serine was chosen at the third position of the consensus sequence of glycosylation, because it has been shown to result in a higher degree of glycosylation than when serine occupies the third position (27Kasturi L. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Shakin-Eshleman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14756-14761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 28Nicolaes G.A. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13584-13591Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A recently created three-dimensional model of FVa was very helpful for the selection of adequate sites for the novel carbohydrate side chains (29Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1317-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 30Pellequer J.L. Gale A.J. Getzoff E.D. Griffin J.H. Thromb. Haemost. 2000; 84: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We focused on introducing the glycosylation sites at residues that are surface-exposed in the three-dimensional model of FVa. Unfortunately, in the model, the end of the A2 domain (after residue 656) is missing. In addition to the computer model of the A domains of FVa, we designed our mutations taking into account documented binding sequences of FVIIIa and corresponding homologous sequences in FVa (20Celie P.H.

The results of this study show that regions surrounding residues 467, 511, 652, and 1683 of FVa are important for binding of FXa and thus for the assembly of the prothrombinase complex.

Bovine serum albumin (BSA), ovalbumin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and leupeptin were purchased from Sigma. Aprotinin was from Bayer (Leverkusen, Germany). Bovine FX (bFX) was purified as described (32Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 355-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and activated using Russel's viper venom (33Furie B.C. Furie B. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Bovine- Factor Xa (bFXa) was labeled with 125I using the chloramine T method. The specific activity was 20,000 cpm/ng, equal to 0.4–0.5 MBq/μg of protein.

Mutations were introduced into the expression vector pMT2 containing the full-length cDNA of human FV using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).

The three amino acids given before the number represent WT FV sequence; the number, referring to the amino acid residue after mutagenesis, represents the carbohydrate attachment site. Expression plasmids containing the various FV cDNA constructs were transfected into COS 1 cells using both the DEAE-dextran method as described (34Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and the LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) method as described by the manufacturer. Proteins were collected 72 h after transfection in serum-free media (Optimem Glutamax). For the expression in the presence of tunicamycin, cells were pretreated with 10 μg/ml tunicamycin prior to protein collection in serum-free media in the presence of 10 μg/ml tunicamycin. Media containing the recombinant proteins were concentrated ∼40-fold using Vivaspin 100,000 molecular weigh cut off, on the day of harvest, and the FV concentration was measured using an ELISA, after minor modifications (35Thorelli E. Kaufman R.J. Dahlback B. Blood. 1999; 93: 2552-2558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, microtiter plates were coated overnight with 10 μg/ml monoclonal Mk1 and then quenched for 30 min. Samples were diluted in ELISA buffer supplemented with 10 mm benzamidine and 2 mm CaCl2 and incubated in 4 °C overnight. Standard curves were created using pooled normal citrated plasma, assuming the FV concentration to be 7 μg/ml (8Tracy P.B. Eide L.L. Bowie E.J. Mann K.G. Blood. 1982; 60: 59-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biotinylated monoclonal HV-1 (0.1 μg/ml) was used as secondary antibody, and after 2 h streptavidin-peroxidase was added. After 30 min, the plates were developed for 3 min, and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm. To rule out that the cell culture medium interfered with the ELISA, plasma-purified FV was diluted in mock medium or in buffer. No difference was detectable, indicating that the medium does not interfere. A pulse Labeling experiment was performed 24 h after transfection by radioactive labeling with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine as previously described with some modifications (36Katsumi A. Senda T. Yamashita Y. Yamazaki T. Hamaguchi M. Kojima T. Kobayashi S. Saito H. Blood. 1996; 87: 4164-4175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cell extracts were prepared by lysis in a cell lysis buffer supplemented with inhibitors. Cell lysate was precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C and immune precipitated overnight at 4 °C using a polyclonal anti-FV antibody, 8806 (20 μg). The immune complexes were precipitated and washed with immune precipitate washing buffer. After elution by boiling, samples were subjected to 2 units/ml thrombin for 30 min in an activation buffer. Proteins were deglycosylated by endoglycosidase H digestion (1 unit/ml) overnight at 37 °C in an endoglycosidase H buffer, supplemented with inhibitors. Boiling the sample terminated the digestion. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar). The gels were then exposed in a cassette and finally scanned using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The purification was performed as described by Heeb et al. (38Heeb M.J. Rehemtulla A. Moussalli M. Kojima Y. Kaufman R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) after some modifications. The supernatant of conditioned medium of rFV (100 ml) was concentrated to 3 ml using the Vivaspin 100,000 molecular weight cut off. Concentrated medium was treated with 10 mm benzamidine and 2 μm PPACK and incubated on ice for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml Hi-trap column (AmershamBiosciences) coupled with 2 mg of anti-(FV light chain) monoclonal antibody AHV 5101 at a flow rate of 0.18 ml/min. The column was then washed with 20 ml of buffer at a flow rate of 0.18 ml/min. Finally, the column was then eluted with buffer B at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and collected in 1-ml fractions. Fractions were analyzed for FVa activity and the SDS-PAGE profile. Pooled fractions were desalted using PD-10 (Amersham Biosciences) and stored at −80 °C. Phospholipids dissolved in chloroform/methanol (9:1, v/v) were dried in a glass tube under a mild flow of nitrogen. The phospholipids were suspended in 25 mmHepes, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5), vigorously vortexed for 2 min, and then sonicated for 10 min at room temperature at amplitude 3, using an XL 2020 sonicator (Misonix). For the binding experiments, the phospholipid composition of the vesicles was PE/PS/PC at molar ratio of 10/20/70. A trace amount of 14C-labeled PC was included, and 10% of the PE was biotinylated. For the prothrombinase assay, the phospholipid composition was PS/PC, at molar ratio of 10/90. Recombinant FV proteins were incubated with 0.5 unit/ml of α-thrombin (Hematologic Technologies Inc.) for 10 min at 37 °C prior to analysis in the prothrombinase assay. Typically, if not specifically noted, the conditions for the prothrombinase assay were 50 pm FVa, 5 nm FXa, 0.5 μm prothrombin, and 50 μm phospholipid vesicles (10/90 of PS/PC). Thrombin generation was allowed to continue for 1 min before the reaction was stopped by dilution with ice-cold EDTA buffer. The amount of generated thrombin was quantified using the chromogenic substrate S-2238. In control experiments, plasma-purified FVa and recombinant wild-type (WT) FVa in conditioned medium behaved similarly with respect to FXa cofactor activity and FXa affinity. Moreover, in the absence of added FV, there was no appreciable thrombin generation. The prothrombinase assay was used to determine the apparent K d for the binding of FXa to the thrombin-activated FV variants. The formation of membrane-bound FXa·FVa complexes was measured by determining the rates of prothrombin activation in the presence of phospholipid vesicles at increasing concentrations of FXa and a fixed concentration of FVa. FVa (50 pm) was preincubated for 4 min with FXa (0.1–50 000 pm) and phospholipid vesicles (50 μm of 10/90, PS/PC). Thrombin generation was started by addition of 0.5 μm preheated prothrombin and allowed to continue for 1 min. The apparent K d for the membrane-bound FXa·FVa complex was obtained from plots of the rate of thrombin generation as a function of the FXa concentration. TheK d was obtained by fitting the data to the following equation for a single-site binding isotherm using non-linear least squares regression analysis, B=Bmax/(1+(Kd/[FXa]))Equation 1 The free concentration of FXa [FXa] was assumed to be equal to the added concentration of FXa. The binding maximum,B max, set as the value where the binding of FXa to WT FVa, was saturated. The K mfor prothrombin activation by the different prothrombinase complexes was determined by varying the prothrombin concentrations. FVa (200 pm) was preincubated for 4 min with increasing concentrations of prothrombin (5–2500 nm) and 25 μm phospholipid vesicles (5/95, PS/PC). Thrombin generation was started by addition of preheated FXa (5 nmfinal concentration) and allowed to proceed for 1 min before being stopped. A magnetic bead-based assay for FXa binding to membrane-bound FVa was performed as described by Rudolph, after some modifications (39Rudolph A.E. Porche-Sorbet R. Miletich J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2861-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this assay, biotinylated phospholipid vesicles were immobilized on the surface of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The beads were washed twice with the assay buffer and then quenched during constant shaking with BSA-containing buffer for 4 h at 37 °C. The beads (2.5 mg/ml) were mixed with 2 mm small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles (biotinylated-PE/PE/PS/PC/[14C]PC, with the molar ratio 1/9/20/70/trace amounts) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C during constant shaking. The beads were then washed twice and resuspended in assay buffer. The concentration of phospholipid was determined by counting [14C]PC and typically found to be around 50 μm. To measure the binding of FXa to membrane-bound FVa, FVa (0.5 nm) was incubated for 10 min with the phospholipid-coated beads. The final concentration of the phospholipid was 625 nm (this concentration was experimentally found to give the best signal-to-noise ratio). Increasing concentrations of125I-bFXa (200–6000 pm) were incubated with the beads for 30 min. The binding reaction was stopped by isolation of the magnetic beads using an MPC-96 plate (Dynal). The collected beads were washed with ice-cold assay buffer to reduce nonspecific binding. The amount of FXa that was associated with the beads and the FXa remaining in the supernatants were measured. Nonspecific binding determined from reactions containing a 100-fold excess of unlabeled bFXa was subtracted from the total binding. In addition, binding that was not dependent on FVa was determined in parallel from reactions lacking added FVa. To estimate the K d of the FXa binding to FVa, the amount of bound FXa was plotted as a function of added FXa concentration. The data were fitted to the above equation for a single site-binding isotherm via non-linear least squares regression analysis. In control experiments, plasma-purified FVa and recombinant WT FVa in conditioned medium behaved in an identical manner. All results are presented as mean values ± S.E. of three independent experiments performed in duplicate. To identify potential interaction sites on FVa for FXa and/or prothrombin, the consensus' sequence Asn-X-Thr for N-linked glycosylation was introduced at thirteen different positions in FV. We took advantage of previously identified interaction sites for FIXa in FVIIIa when choosing probing sites, assuming the FIXa·FVIIIa and FXa·FVa complexes to have similar molecular architectures. Four different FIXa interaction sites in FVIIIa have been identified; three in the A2 domain comprising regions 511–530, 558–565, and 692–710 and one in the A3 domain composed of residues 1811–1818 (20Celie P.H.

Corresponding regions in FVa include residues 455–474, 502–509, and 638–655 in the A2 domain and 1676–1683 in the A3 domain. Therefore, carbohydrate side chains were introduced at FV residues 461, 467, 511, 652, 655, 1677, and 1683 to probe the different regions for FXa interaction sites. In addition, six other carbohydrate side chains were introduced in areas surrounding these segments. Thes"

Together with vesicle-associated membrane protein-2 (VAMP-2) and syntaxin, SNAP-25 forms a ternary complex implicated in docking and fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane during exocytosis. These so-called SNARE proteins are believed to regulate tubulovesicle trafficking and fusion during the secretory cycle of the gastric parietal cell. Here we examined the cellular localization and functional importance of SNAP-25 in parietal cell cultures. Adenoviral constructs were used to express SNAP-25 tagged with cyan fluorescent protein, VAMP-2 tagged with yellow fluorescent protein, and SNAP-25 in which the C-terminal 25 amino acids were deleted (SNAP-25 Δ181–206). Membrane fractionation experiments and fluorescent imaging showed that SNAP-25 is localized to the apical plasma membrane. The expression of the mutant SNAP-25 Δ181–226 inhibited the acid secretory response of parietal cells. Also, SNAP Δ181–226 bound poorly in vitro with recombinant syntaxin-1 compared with wild type SNAP-25, indicating that pairing between syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 is required for parietal cell activation. Dual expression of SNAP-25 tagged with cyan fluorescent protein and VAMP-2 tagged with yellow fluorescent protein revealed a dynamic change in distribution associated with acid secretion. In resting cells, SNAP-25 is at the apical plasma membrane and VAMP-2 is associated with cytoplasmic H,K-ATPase-rich tubulovesicles. After stimulation, the two proteins co-localize on the apical plasma membrane. These data demonstrate the functional significance of SNAP-25 as a SNARE protein in the parietal cell and show the dynamic stimulation-associated redistribution of VAMP-2 from H,K-ATPase-rich tubulovesicles to co-localize with SNAP-25 on the apical plasma membrane.

The secretion of HCl by the gastric parietal cell is driven by a heterodimeric protein known as the H,K-ATPase or proton pump. The regulation of the acid secretory process is thought to be accomplished by secretagogue-dependent trafficking of the proton pump to and from the apical membrane (1Forte J.G. Yao X.

Upon stimulation, the H,K-ATPase-containing cytoplasmic tubulovesicles fuse with the apical (canalicular) membrane and the process is reversed when the stimulus is removed. Evidence to support this recycling model of acid secretion is extensive, although the regulatory mechanisms underlying the trafficking and fusion events remain elusive. Originally from the study of synaptic transmission, we have come to recognize that membrane fusion is mediated by a set of highly conserved proteins called SNARE proteins (3Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 4Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar).

Warren G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 220-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Complementary proteins located on cytoplasmic vesicle membranes are known as v-SNAREs such as VAMP-2. Docking of the vesicle at the plasma membrane occurs through complementary interaction of v-SNAREs and target SNAREs, ultimately to form a stable SNARE complex that perhaps leads to or catalyzes the fusion of the two membranes (4Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Additional factors, both membrane-attached and cytosolic ones, ensure the necessary control of the process. In this study, we used a recombinant adenoviral system to express two of these SNARE proteins, SNAP-25 and VAMP-2 fused to spectrally distinct green fluorescent proteins, in primary cultures of gastric parietal cells. Our goal was to localize the SNARE proteins within the cells and to study their dynamic redistribution when the cells were activated from the resting to stimulated state. We also used a C-terminal deletion mutant of SNAP-25 (SNAP-25 Δ181–206) to examine the role of SNAP-25 in the activation of parietal cells. Gastric mucosal cell fractions were obtained from rabbit and guinea pig stomachs as described previously (6Reenstra W.W. Forte J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and in accordance with procedures approved by the local Animal Care and Use Committee. After tranquilization, animals were injected with 20 mg/kg cimetidine 1 h before sacrifice to put parietal cells in a resting state. Gastric mucosa was homogenized in 25 volumes of buffer containing 5 mm PIPES/Tris, pH 6.7, 125 mm mannitol, 40 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 30 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. After centrifugation at 80 × g for 10 min to remove whole cells and connective tissue, the resulting supernatant was used to generate three crude particulate fractions and a final supernatant by sequential centrifugation steps: P1 (4300 ×g for 10 min) containing large cellular structures including nuclei and plasma membranes; P2 (13,000 × g for 10 min) containing mainly mitochondria and large granules; and P3 (100,000 × g for 1 h) containing ER and H,K-ATPase-rich tubulovesicles (TV). The final high speed supernatant (S3) was saved as the cytosol. An enriched plasma membrane (PM) fraction was prepared from P1 by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h through a density step gradient made of 12 and 18% Ficoll (type 400) with membranes collected from atop each layer (6Reenstra W.W. Forte J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A TV fraction highly enriched in H,K-ATPase was prepared from P3 by density gradient centrifugation on a sucrose step gradient as described previously (7Tyagarajan K. Chow D.C. Smolka A. Forte J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1236: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Isolated gastric glands and parietal cells were prepared from New Zealand White rabbits by a combination of high pressure perfusion and collagenase digestion in HEPES-minimal essential medium (MEM), pH 7.4, as described previously (8Chew C.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 445-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The resulting suspension containing both glands and cells was strained through a 40-μm mesh to remove connective tissue and large debris. The resulting supernatant was left standing on ice for 5–10 min, time sufficient for large gastric glands to settle leaving individual cells suspended in the medium. Intact cells for primary culture were recovered from the suspension by three repetitions of centrifugation (200 ×g for 5 min) followed by resuspension in fresh HEPES-MEM. This low speed centrifugation favors the harvesting of the larger parietal cells, although few other epithelial cells and fibroblasts were recovered. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in medium A consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm glucose, 8 nm epidermal growth factor, 1× SITE medium (Sigma), 1 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 400 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, and 15 μg/liter Geneticin or 20 μg/ml novobiocin, pH 7.4, containing 25 μg/ml amphotericin B to destroy contaminating yeast and bacteria. Cells were then plated onto Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical) coated coverslips in 12-well plates and incubated at 37 °C in culture medium A. For binding studies where we wished to harvest relatively large amounts of SNAP-25 and its C-terminal deletion mutant, settled glands were collected, washed twice in HEPES-MEM, and plated onto Matrigel in medium A as described for cell culture. Membrane fractions were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (1% SDS, 0.4 m urea, 5% 0.7m 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.25 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.0025% bromphenol blue, and 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). Samples were run on 12% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and then probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against SNAP-25 (provided by H. P. Moore, University of California, Berkeley, CA) followed by secondary probing with horseradish peroxidase-tagged goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratories). For the detection of VAMP, we used a polyclonal antibody made in rabbit using GST-VAMP-2 fusion protein as antigen (provided by Dr. A. W. Lowe, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA). This was followed by the goat anti-rabbit IgG tagged with horseradish peroxidase. H,K-ATPase was detected by monoclonal antibody 2G11, a mouse monoclonal antibody against its β-subunit (Affinity Bioreagents) followed by secondary antibody with horseradish peroxidase-tagged goat anti-mouse IgG. Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence with the Renaissance kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Stimulation of parietal cells was quantified using the AP uptake assay as described for cultured parietal cells (9Duman J.G. Tyagarajan K. Kolsi M.S. Moore H.P. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C361-C372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Culture medium was removed from the wells and replaced with 0.5 ml of HEPES-MEM containing 11 nCi/ml [14C]AP. Cells were either held in a resting state by the H2-receptor blocker cimetidine (100 μm) or stimulated by the addition of histamine and IBMX (100 and 30 μm, respectively). Cultures were gently shaken for 30 min at 37 °C. The coverslips were removed from the medium, quickly dipped in phosphate-buffered saline to remove external radioactivity, and incubated in solubilization buffer (125 mm Tris-Cl, 2% SDS, and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then scraped from the coverslip, and the protein content of the cell scrapings was assayed using the filter paper blot method (10Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Aliquots of both the reaction medium and cell scrapings were assayed for [14C]AP by liquid scintillation counting. These data were used to calculate the AP accumulation ratio (ratio of [AP]i:[AP]e). AP uptake values were normalized among the various preparations by expressing data as a fraction of the stimulated control. Adenoviruses were obtained as previously described with the following mouse cDNA constructs (11Xia Z. Zhou Q. Lin J. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1766-1771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Yang Y. Xia Z. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29482-29487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar): SNAP-25 fused to cyan fluorescent protein (CFP); VAMP-2 fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP); SNAP-25 wild type and GFP unfused; and C-terminal deletion mutant SNAP-25 Δ181–206 and GFP unfused. Adenoviruses with the incorporated cDNAs (rAd) were used to infect cells and glands with the respective cDNAs. Infections with rAd were executed by the addition of ∼2 × 106 viral particles/ml to the culture medium immediately after isolation of gastric glands or 6-h post-plating for cultured parietal cells. Various concentrations of viruses were tested with our culture system, and we chose our experimental conditions based on the level of fluorescent protein expression. After 36-h infection, AP uptake experiments were performed on cultured cells. Wild type and mutant SNAP-25 were expressed by rAd infection for 18 h in gastric glands, which were then solubilized with Triton X-100 and used for binding assay. After rAd infection, cultured parietal cells were either held in a resting state or stimulated with histamine plus IBMX. In some cases, cells were treated with a proton pump inhibitor (5 μm SCH-28080) as described previously (13Agnew B.J. Duman J.G. Watson C.L. Coling D.E. Forte J.G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2639-2646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Infected cells were observed in the presence of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) for the duration of live cell imaging. Images were collected using conventional epifluorescence microscopy (excitation/emission: GFP, 488/509 nm; YFP, 500/20 nm; CFP, 436/10 nm) with a Nikon Microphot FX-2 using Isee Imaging software. In the case of cells double-labeled with CFP-SNAP-25 and YFP-VAMP-2, images are presented for each of the fluorescent proteins along with images recorded by differential interference microscopy (DIC). To compare and distinguish the distribution of two fluorophores, we also performed a subtraction of the YFP image from the CFP image. This was done using Isee Imaging software by first adjusting the total intensity of the two images to approximately the same level and then performing a pixel by pixel subtraction. Recombinant rat GST-syntaxin-1 was expressed in bacteria as fusion protein as described previously (12Yang Y. Xia Z. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29482-29487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant SNAP-25 were expressed in gastric glands for 18 h by rAd infection, which were then solubilized with Triton X-100 and used for binding assay. For binding assays, aliquots of total soluble protein were added to 20 μl of glutathione-agarose beads pre-adsorbed with GST-syntaxin-1 and incubated overnight at 4 °C in 300 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100). Beads were washed three times with 0.5 ml of binding buffer at 4 °C. Samples were separated into supernatant and pellet, solubilized in sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blot. Blots were first probed with antibody against SNAP-25, stripped, and then probed with antibody against syntaxin-1 (HPC-1, Sigma). The relative abundance of SNAP-25 in crude subcellular fractions and partially purified membrane fractions from rabbit and guinea pig gastric mucosa was assayed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using a SNAP-25 antibody. The same blots were stripped and reprobed for relative abundance of H,K-ATPase using an antibody against the 60–80-kDa β-subunit. As shown in Fig.1 A for crude cell fractions from rabbit stomach, a visible immunoreactive band was detected in the 25-kDa SNAP-25 region of the low speed fraction (P1) and in the microsomal fraction (P3). There was little or no detectable SNAP-25 reactivity in either the mitochondrial-rich fraction (P2) or the cytosolic supernatant (S3). To better characterize the localization of SNAP-25 in parietal cells, P1 and P3 were further fractionated by density gradient centrifugation. SNAP-25 was highly enriched in the PM fraction purified from P3. In contrast, there was virtually no enrichment of SNAP-25 in the H,K-ATPase-enriched TV fraction purified from P3. The cross-reactivity of the anti-SNAP-25 antibody prepared from immunized rabbit serum resulted in the appearance of several minor immunoreactive bands in the rabbit cell fractions, some more prominent than others (e.g. P1). To circumvent this problem, comparable cell fractions were prepared from guinea pig gastric mucosa. The results shown in Fig. 1 B were similar to those for the rabbit; that is SNAP-25 was most highly enriched in the plasma membrane-rich fractions (P1 and PM), whereas H,K-ATPase was most enriched in the membrane fraction derived from TV P3. Earlier experiments from our laboratory (14Peng X.R. Yao X. Chow D.C. Forte J.G. Bennett M.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and that of Calhoun and Goldenring (15Calhoun B.C. Goldenring J.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) demonstrated that another SNARE protein, VAMP-2 (also known as synaptobrevin), was associated with the H,K-ATPase-rich tubulovesicle fraction from parietal cells. To distinguish the distribution of SNAP-25 and VAMP-2, another set of cell fractions was prepared from rabbit gastric mucosal homogenate and Western blots were probed for these two proteins along with H,K-ATPase as a control. The results shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate that VAMP-2 was most highly enriched along with tubulovesicles and H,K-ATPase-rich membranes, whereas SNAP-25 was more highly enriched in the fractions containing plasma membranes. To further evaluate the cellular localization of SNAP-25, we used fluorescence microscopy in cultured parietal cells infected with adenovirus containing the CFP-SNAP-25 cDNA construct. By 12 h post-infection, parietal cells clearly expressed CFP, and high levels of expression were observed by 36 h post-infection. Cyan fluorescence was detected in ∼90% of the parietal cells. Fig.3 shows the intracellular localization of CFP-SNAP-25 in resting (non-stimulated) rabbit parietal cells 24 h post-infection. At this low magnification, some diffuse fluorescence was found in the cytoplasm of many parietal cells, but a prominence of CFP fluorescence is clearly seen outlining the apical membrane vacuoles. Because these membrane vacuoles in cultured parietal cells are derived from the apical plasma membrane of parietal cells in situ (13Agnew B.J. Duman J.G. Watson C.L. Coling D.E. Forte J.G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2639-2646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we call them apical membrane vacuoles. No fluorescence was detected on the “basolateral” membrane surrounding the cells. Thus, the results indicate that SNAP-25 is clearly targeted to the apical plasma membrane. The C terminus of SNAP-25 has been shown to be important in forming a SNARE complex; therefore, we used a C-terminal deletion mutant of SNAP-25 Δ181–206 to probe for a direct functional role of SNAP-25 in parietal cell activation. After 36 h, cultures infected with adenovirus including either wild type or mutant SNAP-25 or a control adenovirus containing the β-galactosidase gene were compared with uninfected cultures for their acid secretory response to stimulants. Parietal cell cultures from each condition were either maintained in a resting state (cimetidine) or stimulated to maximum secretion with histamine plus IBMX. The [14C]AP uptake was measured as an index of acid secretion (Fig.4). To account for variations among four separate preparations, the [14C]AP uptake ratio was normalized to the control non-infected, stimulated parietal cells that was set at 100% for each experiment. Compared with uninfected controls, [14C]AP uptakes were not significantly lower in cells infected with wild type SNAP-25 adenovirus (85.7 ± 19.2% of stimulated control; p = 0.9) or control adenovirus containing β-galactosidase gene but no SNAP-25 (70.4 ± 14.9% of stimulated control; p = 0.24). However, we detected almost 70% inhibition of acid secretion by cells infected with the C-terminal mutant SNAP-25 (AP ratio was 31.0 ± 5.9% of the stimulated control, p < 0.003). To further explore the molecular involvement of SNAP-25 in the gastric acid secretion process, an in vitro binding assay was performed. SNAP-25 wild type and C-terminal deletion mutant were expressed in cultured rabbit gastric glands by adenovirus infection similar to that used for cell cultures. Membrane proteins were solubilized with Triton X-100 and incubated overnight with GST-syntaxin-1A immobilized on glutathione beads. After separating pellet and supernatant by centrifugation, the fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and successively probed for SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1 by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 5, wild-type SNAP-25 was effective in facilitating the assembly of a complex with syntaxin-1, whereas the C-terminal deletion mutant was much less effective. Wild type SNAP-25 was detected entirely in the binding fraction, but the majority of the C-terminal deletion mutant of SNAP-25 was detected in the non-binding fraction. The mutant, which runs at a lower molecular weight, allows native SNAP-25 to be seen recovered only in the binding fraction (also seen in the non-infected gland lysates). In previous studies, we have shown that expressed GFP-VAMP-2 was localized to cytoplasmic membranes along with H,K-ATPase in resting parietal cell cultures and that the two proteins were translocated to apical membrane commensurate with stimulation of acid secretion (16Karvar S. Yao X. Duman J.G. Hybiske K. Liu Y. Forte J.G. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 281-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here we sought to monitor the dynamic changes in response to stimulation of live parietal cells that were co-infected with adenovirus containing cDNA constructs for CFP-SNAP-25 and YFP-VAMP-2. Cyan fluorescence was detected in ∼90% of the parietal cells. Yellow fluorescence was detected in ∼75% of the parietal cells, most of which also displayed cyan. The distribution of CFP-SNAP-25 and YFP-VAMP-2 in parietal cells during different functional states is shown in Figs. 6 and7 along with a comparable image using DIC optics. In addition, for each cell there is a “coincident fused image” that is a mathematical reconstruction showing only pixels that were positive for both probes. In a series of resting cells shown in Fig. 6, CFP-SNAP-25 was clearly localized to the apical membrane vacuoles, although there was usually some diffuse cytoplasmic labeling. In these same resting cells, YFP-VAMP-2 was observed almost exclusively throughout the cytoplasm surrounding the apical membrane vacuoles but with very limited yellow fluorescence directly on the apical membrane vacuoles. In no case was either CFP-SNAP-25 or YFP-VAMP-2 associated with the basolateral plasma membrane or the visible lamellipodial extensions. Because there was considerable overlap in the CFP and YFP signals, especially in the cytoplasmic region surrounding the apical vacuoles, we performed a mathematical subtraction of YFP signal from that of CFP. The resulting difference is shown in Fig. 6 as the last column of images. In every case, there is a ring of remaining CFP fluorescence denoting that CFP-SNAP-25 is more preferentially localized to the apical membrane vacuoles in the resting parietal cells. Note that the nuclear membrane, which is denoted on the DIC image by an asterisk, is approximately the same size as the apical vacuoles, but it is not labeled by CFP fluorescence and does not appear in the subtractive image. Thus, separate compartments can be identified for the SNAP-25 and VAMP-2 in resting cells, although there is a subset of overlapping coincidence in the cytoplasm.Figure 7Dynamic changes in the intracellular distribution of CFP-SNAP-25 and YFP-VAMP-2 in live parietal cells and following stimulation. Primary cultures of gastric parietal cells were co-infected with recombinant CFP-SNAP-25 and YFP-VAMP-2 adenoviruses and maintained in culture in the presence of 100 μm cimetidine as described in Fig. 6. After 36 h, cimetidine was removed and cells were stimulated with 100 μm histamine plus 30 μm IBMX, either in the absence (A) or presence (B) of the proton pump inhibitor SCH-28080 (5 μm) as indicated. After 25 min of stimulation, live cells were examined for general morphology (DIC) and for CFP-SNAP-25 fluorescence (CFP .SN25) and YFP-VAMP-2 fluorescence (YFP .VMP2). Apical membrane vacuoles are much enlarged in the stimulated state because of the accumulation of HCl and water, whereas the vacuoles are not enlarged when the H+/K+ pump is inhibited by SCH-28080. For both conditions of stimulation, there is a high degree of co-localization of the CFP-SNAP-25 and YFP-VAMP-2 fluorescence on the apical membrane vacuoles and a relative diminution of signal in the cytoplasm. The co-localization is substantiated by the subtractive image (CFP-YFP) in which the vacuolar signal all but disappears. The asterisk in DIC image indicates nucleus. Bar marker is 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the case of cells stimulated by histamine and IBMX, the apical membrane vacuoles become highly enlarged filling with HCl and water because of the action of newly incorporated H,K-ATPase pump. The images of maximally stimulated cells shown in Fig. 7 A demonstrate an almost coincident distribution of CFP-SNAP-25 and YFP-VAMP-2 on the enlarged apical vacuoles, consistent with the notion that YFP-VAMP-2 translocated to the apical membrane after stimulation. However, the relative diminution of free cytoplasmic space in these maximally stimulated cells makes it difficult to exclude the possibility that some spatial artifact might contribute to apparent co-localization of the two signals. We previously showed that treatment of the cells with a proton pump inhibitor eliminates the swelling artifact by inhibiting the delivery of HCl and water while permitting other events in the signaling cascade including the recruitment of H,K-ATPase to the apical membrane vacuoles (13Agnew B.J. Duman J.G. Watson C.L. Coling D.E. Forte J.G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2639-2646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to avoid the swelling artifact parietal cells were stimulated and treated with the proton pump inhibitor SCH-28080. The corresponding images in Fig. 7 B show that CFP-SNAP-25 and YFP-VAMP-2 are primarily associated with the vacuolar membranes, even while the cytoplasmic area was preserved by the treatment of stimulated cells with SCH-28080. Thus, in live parietal cells, there is a dynamic stimulation-dependent co-localization of VAMP-2 and SNAP-25 in the apical plasma membrane vacuoles. In this study, we examined the distribution dynamics and functional importance of SNAP-25 in gastric parietal cells. In the cell fractionation studies, SNAP-25 immunoreactivity was mostly associated with the enriched plasma membrane fraction. SNAP-25 was also detected in the P3 (microsomal) fraction, but because it did not purify with H,K-ATPase-rich tubulovesicles, we suspect that this was may be a contamination of the rough ER. On the other hand, VAMP-2 clearly associates with the P3 fraction and is further enriched when H,K-ATPase is purified by density gradient purification. These data are consistent with earlier work suggesting that VAMP-2 is associated with H,K-ATPase-rich membranes typical of a v-SNARE, whereas SNAP-25 may be associated with the apical plasma membrane more typical of a target SNAREs (14Peng X.R. Yao X. Chow D.C. Forte J.G. Bennett M.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Jons T. Lehnardt S. Bigalke H. Heim H.K. Ahnert-Hilger G. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). However, the present SNAP-25 data are in disagreement with the findings of Jöns et al. (17Jons T. Lehnardt S. Bigalke H. Heim H.K. Ahnert-Hilger G. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) who report that SNAP-25, syntaxin-1, and synaptobrevin (VAMP-2) all co-localize with H,K-ATPase in tubulovesicles of resting parietal cells and redistribute to the apical membrane after stimulation. In their study, Jöns et al. (17Jons T. Lehnardt S. Bigalke H. Heim H.K. Ahnert-Hilger G. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) did not establish co-localization by double labeling but rather used comparative staining patterns observed in sections of resting and secreting gastric mucosa and in isolated parietal cells. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that none of the three proteins was associated with the apical membrane in resting cells. Furthermore, the isolated parietal cell preparations used by these authors were highly rounded and appeared to lack apical membrane vacuoles, indicating that they may have been functionally and morphologically compromised. To localize SNAP-25 more specifically and because we found that existing commercial antibodies against SNAP-25 were not suitable for immunocytochemistry, we used the recombinant adenovirus technique as an ideal vector for introducing specific gene expression into primary cultures of parietal cells. This allowed us to localize targeted protein expression, observe the dynamic changes associated with functional activity, and introduce mutations to alter that activity. Gastric acid secretion by the parietal cell involves secretagogue-regulated recycling of the H,K-ATPase to and from the apical membrane (1Forte J.G. Yao X. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 45-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 2Okamoto C.T. Forte J.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 532: 287-296Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These regulated trafficking events, which deliver the pump to the apical cell surface, result in massive morphological transformations of the parietal cell. The trafficking of the H,K-ATPase and the remodeling of the apical membrane during this process probably involve the coordinated function of vesicular trafficking machinery (1Forte J.G. Yao X. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 45-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 13Agnew B.J. Duman J.G. Watson C.L. Coling D.E. Forte J.G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2639-2646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dramatic nature of the morphological transformation facilitates superior visualization of changes in the distribution of proteins such as SNAP-25 and VAMP-2, affecting fusion. By introducing both CFP-SNAP-25 and YFP-VAMP-2 adenoviral constructs into the same gastric parietal cells, we have successfully studied the subcellular localization and dynamic distribution of these proteins. In resting cells, YFP-VAMP-2 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm in a pattern similar to that of H,K-ATPase. YFP-VAMP-2 was largely translocated to the apical membrane vacuoles upon stimulation. These data are consistent with previous work where GFP-VAMP-2 was expressed in parietal cells (16Karvar S. Yao X. Duman J.G. Hybiske K. Liu Y. Forte J.G. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 281-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the case of parietal cells expressing CFP-SNAP-25, the majority of signal was localized to the apical membrane vacuoles in both resting and stimulated cells; however, there was always a component of CFP-SNAP-25 detected in cytoplasm, especially in the resting state. An artifactual localization is always a possibility when one is inducing overexpression, and the specific location of the expressed protein is frequently related to the integrity of the product such as correct folding, glycosylation, and so forth (18Okamoto C.T. Chow D.C. Forte A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C727-C738Crossref Google Scholar, 19Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cases of overexpression, we would expect to find abundant signal associated with the ER or recycling endosomal compartment as well as in the final targeted cytolocation. The formation and stability of the SNARE complex including VAMP-2, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 are believed to play a central role in the molecular mechanism underlying exocytosis (3Jahn R. Sudhof T.C.

More specifically, botulinum neurotoxins A and E cleave the C-terminal domain of SNAP-25, causing complete or partial inhibition of secretion in neuronal and endocrine systems as well as pancreatic acinar cells (22Lawrence G.W.

Moreover, mutation studies have shown important details regarding the participation of SNAP-25 in the exocytic process (12Yang Y. Xia Z. Liu Y. J. Biol.

These results suggest that SNAP-25 may promote membrane fusion by contributing two cytoplasmic-helices including the C-terminal helix to stabilize the four-helix core complex. Yang et al. (12Yang Y. Xia Z. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29482-29487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) recently report that the overexpression of the C-terminal deletion mutant Δ180–206 significantly inhibited glutamate release from neuronal cells. Because of the functional effects in neuronal cells, we used the C-terminal deletion mutant to study the function of SNAP-25 in parietal cells. In gastric parietal cells, we observed that cells expressing C-terminal deletion mutant SNAP-25 Δ180–206 showed consistent and significant diminution of stimulated acid secretion as compared with wild type expression. In addition, our binding data demonstrate that the C-terminal deletion mutant unlike wild type SNAP-25 was relatively ineffective in associating with syntaxin-1. These secretion and binding data agree with a previous study involving cerebellar neurons, which showed that overexpressed SNAP-25 Δ180–206 mutant altered the vesicle fusion kinetics, reaffirming the importance of SNAP-25 and specifically this C-terminal segment in exocytosis (12Yang Y. Xia Z. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29482-29487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The results also add further evidence for the importance of SNARE proteins for the activation of parietal cells. A major function of the gastric parietal cell is to produce HCl secretion. Because of the massive membrane transformations required for the regulation of its functional activity, the parietal cell may be a model system to characterize the protein-protein interactions that regulate membrane trafficking in other cell types (2Okamoto C.T.

The Fe/S clusters contained in Fe/S proteins are crucial for these functions and have been characterized in considerable detail by biochemical as well as biophysical methods (1Beinert H. Holm R.H.

A related protein is encoded outside the nif operon and has counterparts in non-nitrogen-fixing bacteria (4Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20096-20103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Therefore, a variety of metabolic pathways, which require activated sulfur, depend on IscS, at least in E. coli. This organism also contains two further IscS/NifS-like proteins termed CsdB and CSD. They have been grouped in a separate class of NifS-like proteins based on sequence comparisons (9Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Soda K. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22417-22424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). CsdB has been implicated in selenocysteine metabolism and selenophosphate synthesis (10Lacourciere G.M. Mihara H. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. chem. 2000; 275: 23769-23773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), because it prefers selenocysteine instead of cysteine, forming l-alanine and selenium (see Ref. 11Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar for detailed kinetic studies of the three NifS-like proteins of E. coli). Most recently CsdB was shown to contribute to an isc-independent minor pathway for the assembly of Fe/S clusters in E. coli (12Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Scopus (347) Google Scholar).The cystine lyase C-DES1 is another, but unique, member of the family of NifS-like proteins. It was isolated from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis by its capacity to direct 2Fe-2S cluster assembly of ferredoxin in vitro (13Leibrecht I. Kessler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10442-10447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The cysteinyl residue, which is conserved in the active site of orthodox NifS-like proteins, is lacking. In variance to the NifS-type reaction pathway, C-DES was found to perform a usual β-elimination reaction with l-cystine instead ofl-cysteine as substrate (Reaction 1) (14Lang T. Kessler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar),Cystine+H2O→cysteine persulfide+pyruvate+NH3REACTION1By solving the three-dimensional structure of an N-terminal modified C-DES (C-DESN), it could be demonstrated that the labile product cysteine persulfide firmly bound in a hydrophobic pocket in the active site of C-DES (15Clausen T.

In comparison to NifS that generates a protein-based cysteinyl persulfide, C-DES seems to use an alternative enzymatic strategy to produce activated sulfur for biosynthetic purposes.In this report, the interaction of C-DESN with both the preferred substrate cystine and cysteine was studied in solution by time-resolved absorption spectroscopy and in the crystalline state by polarized absorption microspectrophotometry (16Mozzarelli A.

Furthermore, a catalytically inactive mutant, in which the PLP-binding lysine 223 was replaced by alanine (C-DESK223A), was characterized both at the functional and the structural level. Combining these results with previous structural data (15Clausen T. Kaiser J.T. Steegborn C. Huber R. Kessler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3856-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), a detailed reaction sequence for β-elimination can now be postulated. A structural comparison of C-DES with other members of the NifS-like protein family (NifS (20Kaiser J.T. Clausen T. Bourenkow G.P. Bartunik H.D. Steinbacher S. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and CsdB (21Fujii T. Maeda M. Mihara H. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Hata Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1263-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)) is presented. Specific structural features of NifS-like proteins and implications for Fe-S cluster synthesis are discussed.DISCUSSIONThe net reaction of C-DES consists of the elimination of the Cβ substituent of l-cystine and various cystine analogues. The different covalent intermediates formed during PLP-dependent catalysis exhibit characteristic UV-visible spectra. Thus, the analyses of spectral changes that accompany substrate turnover contribute substantially to the mechanistic understanding of this enzyme implicated in Fe/S-cluster biosynthesis.In analogy to other well characterized β-lyases, the reaction with cystine is associated with a fast disappearance of the internal aldimine, absorbing at 427 nm, and the concomitant formation of a species absorbing at about 340 nm, and a band at 470 nm, attributed to the ketoenamine tautomer of the aminoacrylate. The enolimine tautomer of the α-aminoacrylate usually absorbs at 340–350 nm, the enolimine tautomer of external aldimines at 330–340 nm, and the geminal diamine at 320–330 nm. Thus, all three intermediates are likely candidates for the 340-nm absorbing species, with the quite unstable and low absorbing geminal diamine being the most unlikely one. Most probably, both enolimine tautomers contribute to the 340-nm absorption. In any case, the results suggest a clear preference for an enolimine form. Pursuant to this, the C-DES-catalyzed conversion of cystine should proceed as indicated in Scheme FS1. Most remarkably, the tautomerization equilibrium of the protonated aldimines is inverted in the enzyme-substrate complex with respect to the internal aldimine. The ketoenamine is the predominant tautomer in the absence of substrate, whereas the neutral enolimine dominates upon substrate binding. Because this tautomer prefers a non-polar environment (32Faeder E.J. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 1041-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the change in the tautomer equilibrium indicates an increased hydrophobicity of the environment around the aldimine linkage, which is essential for subsequent product stabilization.Steady-state spectra recorded in the presence of cystine or cysteine reflect the rate-determining steps of the individual reactions. Interestingly, the spectra collected in the presence of the two closely related compounds suggest different key intermediates and thus distinct rate-limiting steps. For cysteine turnover, α-proton abstraction from the external aldimine is rate-limiting, whereas conversion of the aminoacrylate-enzyme intermediate is the critical step during cystine turnover. As indicated in Scheme FS1, these results can be rationalized in the light of the recently solved crystal structure of C-DES complexed with its reaction products (15Clausen T. Kaiser J.T. Steegborn C. Huber R. Kessler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3856-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). One key observation derived from the experiments in the crystalline state is the formation of a species absorbing at 470–480 nm after either prolonged incubation or co-crystallization with cystine or cysteine. Under the crystallization conditions used, this species is the predominant reaction intermediate and, on the basis of x-ray crystallographic data, has been identified as the α-aminoacrylate (15Clausen T. Kaiser J.T. Steegborn C. Huber R. Kessler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3856-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In contrast to aminoacrylate species formed by other PLP-dependent enzymes catalyzing β-elimination and β-replacement reactions (33Miles E.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1979; 49: 127-186PubMed Google Scholar, 34Cook P.F. Hara S. Nalabolou S. Schnackerz K.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2298-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the C-DES aminoacrylate is remarkably stable under crystallization conditions. This is partially due to the low pH of 6.5, where C-DES only displays 8% of its maximal activity, which is observed at pH 8.5; presumably this property reflects a particularly “locked” state of the active site, which impedes reverse transaldimination and concomitant release of iminopropionate. Cysteine persulfide, the product of cystine cleavage, is bound in the active site forming several, specific interactions. It is anchored on the solvent-accessible side of the PLP system, thereby capturing the aminoacrylate-enzyme intermediate and preventing further proceedings in the reaction. Obviously, the scissile “side chain” of cysteine, H2S, is too small to fulfill a similar locking function. In solution this “locking” is somewhat weakened, and cysteine persulfide leaves the active site, which allows a coupled indicator reaction to be used to detect pyruvate as the final product of the C-DES reaction. Nevertheless, our results provide direct spectroscopic evidence that C-DES stabilizes its reaction products. To which extent this stabilization is maintained in solution remains to be proven. The polarization ratio of the 470- to 480-nm band is about four, significantly different from that observed for the species absorbing at 470 nm, obtained immediately upon reaction with cystine and cysteine, suggesting that additionally a slow conformational change might have taken place causing a PLP ring reorientation.The experiments carried out on crystals of C-DESN provide further evidence of the mechanism of catalysis, thus linking function to structure. Formation of the aminoacrylate- and external aldimine-enzyme complexes in the crystalline state indicates that the enzyme is catalytically competent in the reaction with cystine and cysteine. However, in the case of cysteine, the steady-state accumulation of catalytic species appears to be different in the crystal with respect to solution. In fact, a species absorbing at 470 nm, possibly aminoacrylate, is present, whereas no such species was observed in solution. This finding might be due to alteration of the rate-determining step associated to diffusion of substrates and products in and out the crystal channels. It is difficult to exclude that the aminoacrylate intermediate accumulates due to a small amount of cystine formed in the cysteine solution.As compared with cystine cleavage showing the formation of a band at 338 nm, the steady-state intermediate of cysteine cleavage in the crystal exhibits a band at 345 nm, characterized by a polarization ratio close to five, different from those observed for the enolimine tautomers of l-cystine external aldimine and α-aminoacrylate. This finding suggests that the enolimine tautomer of the external aldimine of cysteine possesses either a coenzyme orientation different from the enolimine tautomer of cystine, or the transition dipole moments directions of the two enolimines are significantly different. Unfortunately, due to crystal morphology, it is not possible to collect spectra in the third direction, thus preventing to obtain further information.As in solution, the K223A mutant exhibits a spectrum characteristic of a Schiff-base linkage. As shown in Fig. 6 A, in agreement with the spectroscopic data, the electron density can be interpreted as an external aldimine with a glycine acquired from the surrounding medium and anchoring its carboxylate group to Arg-360. The only subtle changes in the spectra when the K223A mutant is incubated with cysteine or cystine can be attributed to a slow transaldimination reaction from the external Gly-aldimine to the external substrate-aldimine. The absence of the absorption at 338 nm, which was attributed to an enolimine species, can be explained in the light of the active site structure of the mutant. The place available upon Lys-223 → Ala replacement is occupied by three water molecules. Therefore the surrounding of the Schiff-base linkage in the mutant is much more hydrophilic thus favoring the ketoenamine species regardless of the bound ligand.Concerning the crystallographic results for the early and late steps of the reaction, it is possible to draw the following picture. We assume that the substrate cystine is pre-oriented by binding with one of its carboxylate groups to Arg-369. Initially cystine is spanned in an extended conformation (E*S1) between Arg-369 and Trp-251*. In this binding mode, the distal substrate carboxylate group is 5.6 Å from the guanidino group of Arg-360. Transaldimination to the external aldimine can take place with a concomitant rearrangement of cystine and Arg-360, gathering the distal carboxylate group of the substrate. In this way, cystine reorients into a bent conformation similar to the subsequently formed product molecules (E*S2). On one hand, this rearrangement causes stress in the substrate SS bond, on the other hand, this leads to subtle side-chain movements in the active site. Trp-168 moves by about 0.8 Å away from the active site center. This residue forms part of the proximal wall of the active site and is in contact to His-114, the residue stacking to the cofactor. While moving, Trp-168 frees space for His-114 allowing it to rotate by about 20° around the Cβ-Cγ bond. This rotation is necessary to accommodate for the movement of the external aldimine-PLP adduct. In turn, the hydrophobic loop around Tyr-282* moves about 1.6 Å backward, thereby increasing the total hydrophobic surface area of the active site and, at the same time, forming the distal wall of the hydrophobic pocket, which finally stabilizes the cysteine persulfide product. During β-lysis His-114 moves by 1.8 Å toward Trp-168, thereby forming the final hydrophobic pocket. Interestingly, the substrate binding is accompanied with an opening of the enzyme of about 3.5 Å. This breathing is only observed in the substrate complexed form and cannot be attributed to specific movements. It is best reflected by the r.m.s.d. of the E to E*S over all Cα atoms of 1.4 Å compared with the deviations ofE to E* and E to EP of 0.2 and 0.1 Å, respectively.Using the crystallographic results for the early (E,E*S1, E*S2) and late steps (EP) and the spectroscopic results for the intermediate steps, it is now possible to draw a mechanism for the enzymatic action of C-DES (Fig. 7). The substrate cystine is acquired by C-DES in an extended conformation being spanned between Arg-369 and Trp-251*, permitting transaldimination in a relaxed substrate state. Subsequent rearrangement of the distal substrate carboxylate group toward Arg-360 positions cystine in a conformation similar to the products, which seems to be necessary for C-S bond cleavage. Concomitant movement of the active site residues around Gly-260* enlarges the hydrophobic distal wall of the active site, which is essential for persulfide stabilization. The increased hydrophobic nature of the active site is also reflected by the preference for the enolimine tautomer of the external aldimine. Subsequent substrate Cα deprotonation and β-lysis position the product cysteine persulfide in the hydrophobic pocket generated by Trp-251*, Tyr-256*, Pro-115, and His-114 and retains the aminoacrylate of PLP. The fact that hydrolysis of the aminoacrylate intermediate is rate-limiting points to the locking of this complex in an unreactive state. Reverse transaldimination yielding iminopropionate can only occur after cysteine persulfide is released from the active site. This explains the unusual stability of the ternary complex between enzyme, PLP-aminoacrylate, and cysteine persulfide thus suggesting a role of C-DES as persulfide carrier protein.Figure 7Crystallographically determined reaction cycle of C-DES.

Clausen T. Bourenkow G.P. Bartunik H.D. Steinbacher S. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and CsdB (21Fujii T. Maeda M. Mihara H. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Hata Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1263-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) are all classified as NifS-like enzymes. Although the production of activated atomic chalcogen species is common to these proteins, they show remarkably distinct reactivities. In contrast to NifS, CsdB shows preference for selenocysteine over cysteine. This reactivity is not inhibited by thiol-alkylating agents, thus demonstrating a deviation from the mechanism proposed for cysteine desulfuration by NifS, although possessing the conserved cysteine residue in the C-terminal part of the protein. Not surprisingly, these agents do not inhibit C-DES, in which the active site Cys is absent. C-DES is compensating for this residue by using cystine as substrate, thereby mimicking it by the substrate itself. The most obvious structural difference is the absence of a large loop with partial β-structure in NifS, which forms the distal wall of the active site in C-DES and CsdB (Fig. 8). This part bears residues crucial for persulfide stabilization in C-DES, suggesting a similar mechanism of product stabilization for CsdB. Nevertheless, in the region of the distal wall, the active site of C-DES is by far the most closed due to Trp-251*. In CsdB the corresponding wall is constructed by Ala-125, Gly-253*, and Gly-277* in tmNifS by Gly-228* and Gly-237*. The preference for hydrophobic residues in this segment is evident, though the binding of the substrate in this region can lock probably only C-DES. Another remarkable difference concerning NifS, on one hand, and CsdB and C-DES, on the other hand, is the “Cys-324” loop. In NifS, where Cys-324 is crucial for function, this loop is by far the longest, composed of mainly hydrophilic and small residues (STSSACTSKDER in tmNifS) and disordered in the crystal structure. C-DES shows only a small turn and CsdB exhibits a short loop, composed of large and hydrophobic residues (VRTGHHCAMPL). This further points to the close relationship of C-DES and CsdB, whose functions seem not to depend on this flexible loop. As it has been suggested for NifS, this loop may act as a sulfur-delivery arm (20Kaiser J.T. Clausen T. Bourenkow G.P. Bartunik H.D. Steinbacher S. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). C-DES and CsdB seem to supply their reaction products directly from the active site.Figure 8Comparison of C-DES , NifS, and CsdB.A, stereo representation of the overlaid Cαtraces: NifS (yellow), C-DES (red), and CsdB (blue). B, topology diagrams of C-DES, NifS, and CsdB with differences emphasized in red. C, comparison of the active sites of the three enzymes with critical residues labeledView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Remarkably, CsdB has an analogue to Arg-360 of C-DES, namely Arg-359. Both residues superimpose well, suggesting that possibly CsdB can utilize cystine or probably selenocystine as substrate. In the light of the finding that, at least in case of the selenocysteine-lyase activity of CsdB Cys-364, the homologue to Cys-324 in NifS, is not necessary, this similarity needs further investigation.In summary, the family of NifS-like enzymes, although sharing remarkable sequence homologies, seems to perform catalysis by quite distinct mechanisms. In this work we have shown by combining spectroscopic and crystallographic results a possible mode of stabilization of the reaction product of C-DES, an, albeit quite unique, NifS-like enzyme. Comparative spectroscopic, biochemical, and crystallographic studies of more proteins of this interesting family of enzymes will surely help to understand the evolutionary relationship of a clan of “cofactor chaperones” required to build up the probably most ancient cofactor, the iron-sulfur cluster. Iron sulfur (Fe/S) proteins perform important biological functions varying from electron transfer and catalysis to gene regulation and redox sensing (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Beinert H. Holm R.H. Münck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar and 2Johnson M.K. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The Fe/S clusters contained in Fe/S proteins are crucial for these functions and have been characterized in considerable detail by biochemical as well as biophysical methods (1Beinert H. Holm R.H. Münck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). However, research concerning the biosynthetic assembly of these complexes has intensified only recently. The characterization of nif gene products besides the nitrogenase components NifH, NifD, and NifK of Azotobacteridentified NifS as a cysteine desulfurase that provides activated sulfur for cluster assembly in form of an enzyme-bound persulfide yielding l-alanine as the byproduct (3Zheng L.

A related protein is encoded outside the nif operon and has counterparts in non-nitrogen-fixing bacteria (4Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol.

Therefore, a variety of metabolic pathways, which require activated sulfur, depend on IscS, at least in E. coli. This organism also contains two further IscS/NifS-like proteins termed CsdB and CSD. They have been grouped in a separate class of NifS-like proteins based on sequence comparisons (9Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Soda K. Esaki N. J. Biol.

Lutz Y. Gansmuller A. Vonesch J.L. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1671-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). 10.2 ml of 30–50% linear sucrose gradients were prepared in 10 mm Hepes KOH buffer pH 7.5 containing 1 mm EDTA, 35 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor cocktail (2.5 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, antipain, chymostatin) (1× PIC), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) in Beckman tubes (44Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and overlaid with 0.4 ml of the same buffer containing 5% sucrose (20Remboutsika E. Lutz Y. Gansmuller A. Vonesch J.L. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1671-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 0.8 ml of chromatin was applied on the top, and the sample was centrifuged in a SW41 rotor (Beckman) at 26,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C. At the end of the centrifugation, 1-ml fractions were recovered from the top of the gradient and 50 μl were used either directly for immunoblotting or deproteinized for plasmid DNA isolation (47Paranjape S.M. Krumm A. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1978-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Chromatin reconstruction was performed on pBluescript plasmid (2.9 kbp, Stratagene) using a core histone:DNA molar ratio of 1:1, by step salt dialysis from 2 m to 0.05 m NaCl in 100 mm Tris HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 (buffer A) in dialysis bags presaturated with 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The samples were dialyzed in buffer A (above) containing 2, 1.5, 1, 0.5m NaCl for 2 h and 0.05 m NaCl overnight at 4 °C. Chromatin was purified by sucrose gradient sedimentation and prepared for electron microscopy. Chromatin, prepared either by chromatin assembly using the S190 extract or by salt dialysis, was purified by sucrose gradient sedimentation and dialyzed in 5 mmtriethanolamine, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm PMSF before it was diluted to an estimated DNA concentration of 1 ng/μl. Grids were prepared and observed under a Philips CM12 electron microscope (48Dubochet J. Ducommun M. Zollinger M. Kellenberger E. J Ultrastruct. Res. 1971; 35: 147-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Size measurements for individual nucleosomes were performed using the NIH Image program; particles were circled, and the program was fitted an ellipse to define a long and short axis. Deletion and point mutations were generated by PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing. TIF1α and TIF1α(1–791) were cloned into the pAcSG-His-NTA expression vector (PharMingen) and expressed in baculovirus-infected SF9 cells using recombinant baculoviruses. TIF1α(734–1017), TIF1α(734–853), and TIF1α(854–1017) were cloned into the pET15b expression vector (Novagen) and overexpressed inE. coli BL21(DE3) cells. All clones had a His tag at the N terminus. Recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Amersham Biosciences), dialyzed in 12.5 mm Hepes-KOH buffer, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 50 μm EDTA, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× PIC, 1 mm PMSF, and 50% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. 1.5 × 107P19 nuclei were incubated with 24 units of MNase (Roche) in 200 μl of buffer N for 30 min at 37 °C as described (20Remboutsika E. Lutz Y. Gansmuller A. Vonesch J.L. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1671-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant (S1 fraction, euchromatin) was collected (20Remboutsika E. Lutz Y. Gansmuller A. Vonesch J.L. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1671-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Huang S.Y. Garrard W.T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 116-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and genomic DNA fragments were purified after Proteinase K treatment (40 μg/ml), phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. DNA fragments were cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript and sequenced. One of the clones contained a 158-bp insert with a unique PstI site whereas a 145-bp fragment, including an 8-bp multiple cloning site from pBluescript in the 5′-flanking region of the insert, was released byHindIII-PstI digestion (for core nucleosome reconstitution). This fragment was designated M2. M2 sequence (158 bp) is shown below: 5′-GAGTTTGCCATTGAAACTTAAAGTAGGGGAAGAAGGGCTGAGGAGGTGACTCATGGATAAGAGCATTCCTTGCTCTTTGAGAGTAAATGACAGTTCACAATTGCCTGTAACCCTAACTCCATGGCATCTGATCCTTCTGCAGACCTCTGTGGCCTCCT-3′. Another clone contained a 173-bp insert and a 189-bp fragment, including an 8-bp multiple cloning site both in the 5′- and 3′-flanking region of the insert, was released byHindIII-EcoRI digestion (for linker-contained nucleosome reconstitution). This fragment, designated M4.M4 sequence (173 bp) is: 5′- CAGCCGGCCTTAGAAAGGCCATCTGATTCTTTGAGTTGCTTGTGGTCGACGCAGAGTCGCCACCGTTTCTGGTTTCTTTTTTGTCTTAGTCTCGTGTCCGCTCTTGTAGTGTCTACTGTTTTTCTAGAAATGGGACAATCGGTGTCCACTCCCCTTTCTCTGAATCTGGAGCA-3′. The M2 and M4 sequences have been submitted to Genbank data base with accession numbers AY155467 (M2) and AY155468 (M4). Proteins and DNA from P19 cells (3 × 106 per plate) were crosslinked by the addition of formaldehyde directly to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1% and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The medium was then aspirated, and the cells were washed twice using ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline in the presence of protease inhibitors as described above. 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH, and a protease inhibitor mixture) were added to each plate, the cells were scraped off, placed into an Eppendorf tube, and incubated on ice for 10 min before they were sonicated to generate 200- to 1000-bp fragments. After centrifugation, the cleared supernatant was diluted 10-fold with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5%Nonidet P-40, and 1× PIC). The cell lysate was precleared by incubation with 40 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A beads (Upstate Biotechnology) supplemented with 40 μl of either protein A (for polyclonal antibodies) or protein G (for monoclonal antibodies) beads for 2 h at 4 °C. At the same time, with anti-acetylated histone H3 polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) or no antibody (negative control), the following was pre-absorbed on 80 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A beads:Protein A beads (1:1 ratio) and anti-TIF1α monoclonal antibody (5T1E8) on 80 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A beads:protein G beads (1:1 ratio) in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer for 2 h at room temperature. At the end of the incubation period, the antibody-coupled beads were washed once in immunoprecipitation buffer before they were further incubated with the cleared lysates overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated on the beads by centrifugation, washed twice in immunoprecipitation buffer, and eluted in 1% SDS/100 mmsodium carbonate. DNA-protein crosslinks were reversed by heating the samples at 65 °C for 4 h, and the DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Levels of M2 and M4 genomic fragments were determined by PCR using specific sets of oligonucleotides that would generate 130-bp and 160-bp DNA fragments, respectively. The primers used for PCR were: for the M2 fragment, 5′-GTAGGGGAAGAAGGGCTGAGGAGGTGACTC-3′ (primer A, 5′ → 3′) and 5′-CCACAGAGGTCTGCAGAAGGATCAGATGCC-3′ (primer B, 3′ → 5′); and for the M4 fragment, 5′-TAGAAAGGCCATCTGATTCTTTGAGTTGCT-3′ (primer A, 5′ → 3′) and 5′-TCCAGATTCAGAGAAAGGGGAGTGGACACC-3′ (primer B, 3′ → 5′). 1.5 × 107 P19 nuclei were incubated with 24 units of MNase (Roche) in 100 μl of buffer N for 30 min at 37 °C as described (20Remboutsika E. Lutz Y. Gansmuller A. Vonesch J.L. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1671-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Huang S.Y. Garrard W.T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 116-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× PIC, and 1 mm PMSF solution and incubated for 10 min on ice (20Remboutsika E. Lutz Y. Gansmuller A. Vonesch J.L. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1671-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The supernatant (S2 fraction, heterochromatin) was collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C, and the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 0.35 m. To deplete histone H1, an equal volume of 80% slurry of CM Sephadex C-25 (in 0.35 m NaCl) was added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rocking. The supernatant was recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. H1 depletion was confirmed by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody specific for mouse histone H1 (data not shown). M2 and M4 DNA fragments were end-labeled with [α32P]dCTP using Klenow DNA polymerase and incubated in a 1:1 ratio with histone H1-depleted donor nucleosomes in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 1m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol for 1 h. TE buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) was added to adjust the NaCl concentration to 0.8 m. After 1 h of incubation, the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 0.66 m, followed by a 1-h incubation before NaCl was subsequently diluted to 0.2, 0.1, and 0.05 m with successive additions of TE every 10 min. All incubations were performed at room temperature. Nucleosome particles were purified by sedimentation in sucrose as described (20Remboutsika E. Lutz Y. Gansmuller A. Vonesch J.L. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1671-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm PMSF at 26,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW60 rotor. Fractions were collected and analyzed by 4% (29:1) native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris base/45 mm boric acid/1.25 mm EDTA) for 1 h at 10V/cm. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Unless otherwise indicated, 1 μg (0.7 μm) of purified TIF1α protein was incubated either with32P-labeled reconstituted nucleosomes or naked DNA in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 15 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol for 15 min at room temperature. For quantitative EMSA, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 μg of TIF1α (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 μm), TIF1α (734–853)(PHD) (0.8, 1.6, 3.2, and 6.4 μm), and TIF1α(734–1017)(BrD) (0.6, 1.2, 2.3, and 4.6 μm) were used. For competition experiments, 25 or 100 μg/ml poly(dI·dC) was included in the reaction. Samples were loaded onto 4% (29:1) native polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed at room temperature in 0.5× TBE for 1 h at 10 V/cm. Gels were dried and exposed to autoradiography. The fact that TIF1α associates with euchromatinin vivo (20Remboutsika E. Lutz Y. Gansmuller A. Vonesch J.L. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1671-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) prompted us to analyze its molecular properties on reconstituted chromatin in vitro. For our study, we used an in vitro chromatin assembly system prepared fromDrosophila postblastoderm embryos (S-190 extract) (44Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 45Remboutsika E. Jacq X. Tora L. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1978-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion analysis (Fig. 1 E), supercoiling assays (data not shown), and electron microscopy (Fig. 1, Aand F) demonstrated that the extract efficiently assembled regularly spaced nucleosomal arrays (50Oudet P. Gross-Bellard M. Chambon P. Cell. 1975; 4: 281-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) on various length templates in the presence of exogenously added core histones as previously described (44Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Because the S-190 extract appeared to be devoid of any detectable TIF1α cross-reacting activity (Fig. 1 C, Western Blot), purified recombinant mouse TIF1α (Fig. 1 C,Coomassie Staining) was included in the assembly reaction to determine whether TIF1α can be incorporated efficiently onto chromatin (Fig. 1 B). At the end of the chromatin assembly reaction, chromatin (assembled on mRARβ2-LacZ, (Ref. 46Mendelsohn C. Ruberte E. LeMeur M. Morriss-Kay G. Chambon P. Development. 1991; 113: 723-734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 10.2 kb) was purified by sucrose gradient sedimentation and the DNA was isolated and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining (44Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 45Remboutsika E. Jacq X. Tora L. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1978-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 D). From immunoblotting analysis of gradient fractions and by comparison to the sedimentation profile of the recombinant protein, it was evident that TIF1α was readily incorporated onto chromatin assembled in vitro (Fig. 1 B). A ratio of approximately one TIF1α molecule per 3 nucleosomes was estimated. When chromatin generated with or without TIF1α was subjected to time-dependent MNase digestion (45Remboutsika E. Jacq X. Tora L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12781-12784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), we found that TIF1α incorporation had no apparent effect on the regularity of nucleosomal spacing (Fig. 1 E). Moreover, analysis of purified chromatin by electron microscopy, where fully assembled chromatin was indeed observed both with and without TIF1α (Fig. 1, A and F), indicated that TIF1α does not affect the efficiency of the chromatin assembly (Fig. 1,A, E, and F). However, chromatin prepared with TIF1α consistently presented a statistically significant enlargement in core nucleosome dimensions (Fig. 1 F). Nucleosomes assembled in the presence of TIF1α presented on average an increase of 16–19 Å when compared with core nucleosomes (50Oudet P. Gross-Bellard M. Chambon P. Cell. 1975; 4: 281-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when chromatin was packaged either using postblastoderm extracts (Fig. 1, A andD) or by salt dialysis using purified core histones (Fig. 1 D; data not shown), suggesting an interaction between TIF1α and core nucleosomes. These results demonstrate that TIF1α associates with chromatin in vitro and moreover indicate that no additional factors are required to mediate TIF1α-chromatin interactions. In the nucleus, TIF1α is tightly bound to euchromatin (20Remboutsika E. Lutz Y. Gansmuller A. Vonesch"

CFTR inhibits epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) currents in many epithelial and non-epithelial cells, whereas the presence of ENaC increases CFTR functional expression. This interregulation is reproduced inXenopus oocytes where both the open probability and surface expression of wild type CFTR Cl− channels are increased when CFTR is co-expressed with αβγ-mouse ENaC (mENaC) and conversely when the activity of mENaC is inhibited after wild type CFTR activation. Using the Xenopus oocyte expression system, different functional regulatory interactions were observed between G551D-CFTR and αβγ-mENaC. The co-expression of G551D-CFTR and αβγ-mENaC resulted in a 5-fold increase in G551D-CFTR Cl− current compared with oocytes expressing G551D-CFTR alone. Oocytes co-injected with both G551D-CFTR and ENaC expressed an amiloride-sensitive whole cell current that was similar to that observed before and after G551D-CFTR activation with forskolin/isobutylmethylxanthine.

In contrast, the ΔF508-CFTR mutation, the most prevalent mutation found in North American Caucasian patients with CF, does not inhibit the functional expression of rat (15Mall M. Hipper A. Greger R.

The G551D mutation in CFTR results in a channel that is appropriately localized to the apical membrane but does not normally conduct Cl− in response to cAMP stimulation (20Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Genistein can improve G551D-CFTRs cAMP-dependent chloride transport (19Illek B. Zhang L. Lewis N.C. Moss R.B. Dong J.Y. Fischer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C833-C839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Others have shown that G551D-CFTR does not inhibit sodium transport by ENaC in Xenopus oocytes (6Briel M. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. J. Physiol (Lond.). 1998; 508: 825-836Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that genistein would restore the functional interactions between G551D-CFTR and mENaC and examined this interaction in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. ENaC was able to enhance the functional expression of G551D-CFTR in the absence of genistein, in contrast to our previous results examining interactions between ΔF508-CFTR and ENaC (11Suaud L., Li, J. Jiang Q. Rubenstein R.C. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8928-8933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous data, we observed that G551D-CFTR did not inhibit the functional expression of ENaC after activation with IBMX/forskolin (6Briel M. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. J. Physiol (Lond.). 1998; 508: 825-836Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As we observed with ΔF508-CFTR, genistein restored functional interactions between G551D-CFTR and ENaC. Forskolin, IBMX, and genistein were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were purchased from Fisher Chemical Company. Human G551D-CFTR and mouse ENaC were expressed inXenopus oocytes as described previously (10Jiang Q., Li, J. Dubroff R. Ahn Y.J. Foskett J.K. Engelhardt J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

Human G551D-CFTR and mouse α-, β-, and γ-ENaC cRNAs were prepared using a cRNA synthesis kit (mMESSAGE mMachine, Ambion Inc, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cRNA concentrations were determined spectroscopically. Oocytes obtained from adult femaleXenopus laevis (NASCO, Fort Atkinson, WI) were enzymatically defolliculated and maintained at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mmCa(NO3)2, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, supplemented with 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate). Each batch of oocytes obtained from an individual frog was injected (50 nl/oocyte) using a Nanoject II microinjector (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA) with α, β, and γ subunits of mENaC (0.33 ng/subunit), G551D-CFTR (10 ng), or a combination of mENaC and G551D-CFTR cRNAs dissolved in RNase-free water. Whole cell current measurements were performed 24–48 h after injection using the two-electrode voltage clamp method as described previously (10Jiang Q., Li, J. Dubroff R. Ahn Y.J. Foskett J.K. Engelhardt J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13266-13274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Suaud L., Li, J. Jiang Q. Rubenstein R.C. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8928-8933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Oocytes were placed in a 1-ml chamber containing modified ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 5.8 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and impaled with micropipettes of 0.5–5-megohm resistance filled with 3 m KCl. The whole cell currents were measured by voltage-clamping the oocytes in 20-mV steps between −140 and +60 mV adjusted for base-line transmembrane potential. Whole cell currents (I) were digitized at 200 Hz during the voltage steps, recorded directly onto a hard disk, and analyzed using pClamp 8 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Ion replacement studies were performed in an identical manner with the exception that equimolar N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG+) replaced Na+ in the ND96 solution. To reduce error due to series resistance, the voltage clamp (Axon Geneclamp 500B) was configured to clamp the bath potential to 0 mV. In this configuration, we independently monitored the oocyte membrane potential during our clamp protocol and routinely observed membrane potentials that were <5% depolarized from our target holding potentials. The difference in whole cell currents measured in the absence and presence of 10 μm amiloride was used to define the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current that was carried by ENaC. G551D-CFTR was activated by perfusion of the oocyte with buffer containing 10 μm forskolin and 100 μm IBMX for 25 min (10Jiang Q., Li, J. Dubroff R. Ahn Y.J. Foskett J.K. Engelhardt J. Kleyman T.R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8928-8933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In some experiments, this first step was followed by incubation with 10 μm forskolin, 100 μmIBMX, and 50 μm genistein for 20 min. In all experiments, G551D-CFTR Cl− current was defined as the difference between amiloride-insensitive current measured before and after perfusion with forskolin/IBMX (or before and after perfusion with forskolin/IBMX/genistein). Whole cell currents were recorded at a clamp potential of −100 mV for comparisons. All measurements were performed at room temperature. Bath and pipette solutions were identical and contained 110 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 2.5 mm KCl, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Oocytes were placed in a hypertonic solution (bath solution supplemented with 200 mm sucrose, 10 μmforskolin, 100 μm IBMX, and 50 μmgenistein) for 5–10 min, and the vitelline membranes were then removed manually. The oocytes were then transferred to the bath solution containing 10 μm forskolin, 100 μm IBMX, and 50 μm genistein and maintained at room temperature (22–25 °C) for at least 20 min before recording. Patch pipettes with a tip resistance of 20–35 megohms were used. Currents were recorded in the cell-attached configuration using Axopatch 200B Patch Clamp Amplifier (Axon) and DigiData 1322A interface (Axon) connected to Pentium 4, 1.5 GHz PC (Gateway, Inc.). Single channel recording data were acquired using pClamp 8.1 (Axon) at 4 kHz, filtered at 1000 Hz by a 4-pole low pass Bessel Filter built in the amplifier, and stored on the hard disk. Single channel currents were further filtered at 500 Hz with a Gaussian filter for display purposes. Recordings were performed at −80 mV. pCLAMP version 6.0 and Clampfit 8.1 (Axon) and SigmaPlot version 2001 (Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA) software were used for data analysis and plotting, respectively. The open probability (P o) was calculated as P o= I/(n × i) where I is the mean current, nis the number of channels in the patch, and i is the single channel current. Statistical comparisons were performed using the Student's t test. A pairwise t test was used for pretreatment and posttreatment in experiments using an individual oocyte. A two-tailed t test was used when comparing currents obtained from oocytes injected with a cRNA for a single transporter (i.e. ENaC or G551D-CFTRversus oocytes co-injected with a cRNAs for both ENaC and G551D-CFTR). p values < 0.05 were accepted to indicate statistical significance. We used the Xenopus oocyte expression system and two-electrode voltage clamp technique to examine the functional expression of G551D-CFTR. We measured whole cell currents at varying clamping potentials in oocytes expressing G551D-CFTR (Fig. 1) and generated I/V curves from data obtained prior to and after 20 min of incubation with 10 μm forskolin and 100 μm IBMX to activate endogenous protein kinase A (Fig. 1 A). Whole cell currents measured at a holding potential of −100 mV (adjusted for resting membrane potential) increased two-fold from −0.1 ± 0.0 to −0.2 ± 0.1 μA (mean ± S.E., n = 22,p = 0.006) in response to forskolin/IBMX. These data are consistent with previous observations that forskolin/IBMX-stimulated chloride current in G551D-CFTR-expressing oocytes is very low (14Kunzelmann K. Kiser G.L. Schreiber R. Riordan J.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As the isoflavone genistein is able to stimulate G551D-CFTR chloride conductance (19Illek B. Zhang L. Lewis N.C. Moss R.B. Dong J.Y. Fischer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C833-C839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whole cell currents in G551D-CFTR-expressing oocytes were assessed before and after additional stimulation with 50 μm genistein (in addition to IBMX and forskolin). Fig. 1 B demonstrates the I/V relationship prior to and after activation of G551D-CFTR by 25 min of incubation with 10 μm forskolin and 100 μm IBMX followed by 15 min of incubation with 10 μm forskolin, 100 μm IBMX, and 50 μm genistein. Whole cell currents measured at a clamp potential of −100 mV increased 4.4-fold from −0.09 ± 0.0 to −0.4 ± 0.1 μA (n = 21, p < 0.001) after the addition of IBMX, forskolin, and genistein. These data are consistent with IBMX/forskolin-stimulated G551D-CFTR-mediated chloride current being enhanced by genistein in Xenopusoocytes. Given the small magnitude of the whole oocyte current in these experiments, it is possible that the regulation of endogenous channels may contribute to these observations. However, we do not feel that modulation of endogenous currents confound our data. Forskolin, IBMX, and genistein did not alter whole cell currents in oocytes that had not been injected with G551D-CFTR (n = 3). We also assessed the I/V relationship of G551D-CFTR-injected oocytes in the presence of inhibitors of putative endogenous channels (Fig. 1 C). The I/V relationships in the absence (Fig. 1, A andB) and presence of these inhibitors (Fig. 1 C) were similar. These data suggest that endogenous oocyte channels do not confound our observations. Several groups have reported (7Chabot H. Vives M.F. Dagenais A. Grygorczyk C. Berthiaume Y. Grygorczyk R. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Ji H.L.

Furthermore, the co-expression of ENaC enhances forskolin/IBMX-stimulated CFTR Cl− currents (7Chabot H. Vives M.F. Dagenais A. Grygorczyk C. Berthiaume Y. Grygorczyk R. J. Membr.

Whole cell currents measured at a holding potential of −100 mV in oocytes injected with G551D-CFTR (10 ng) or αβγ-ENaC (0.33 ng/subunit) or both G551D-CFTR and αβγ-ENaC are shown Fig. 2. In oocytes expressing αβγ-ENaC, the amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents measured at a clamp potential of −100 mV were similar in the absence or presence of 10 μm forskolin and 100 μm IBMX. These data are consistent with previous reports (7Chabot H. Vives M.F. Dagenais A. Grygorczyk C. Berthiaume Y. Grygorczyk R. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Mall M. Hipper A. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Oocytes co-injected with G551D-CFTR and αβγ-ENaC had 5-fold increased forskolin/IBMX-stimulated, amiloride-insensitive current compared with oocytes injected with G551D-CFTR alone (Fig. 2 A, ICl = −0.1 ± 0.0 μA (G551D-CFTR)versus −0.5 ± 0.1 μA (G551D-CFTR/αβγ-ENaC),p = 0.007). Thus, a co-expression of ENaC in oocytes resulted in enhanced forskolin/IBMX-stimulated G551D-CFTR Cl− current similar to its previously described enhancement of WT CFTR current (7Chabot H.

Oocytes co-injected with both G551D-CFTR and ENaC expressed amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents (−2.8 ± 0.6 μA,n = 25) in the absence of forskolin/IBMX that were significantly lower than the amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents recorded in the absence of forskolin/IBMX in oocytes injected with ENaC alone (−5.3 ± 1.0 μA, n = 22). However, similar levels of amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents were observed in oocytes co-injected with G551D-CFTR and ENaC prior to and after G551D-CFTR activation with forskolin/IBMX (−2.8 ± 0.6 μAversus −2.5 ± 0.6 μA, n = 25,p = n.s.) (Fig. 2 B), which is similar to ΔF508-CFTR behavior and differs from WT CFTR behavior in this system (10Jiang Q., Li, J. Dubroff R. Ahn Y.J. Foskett J.K. Engelhardt J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13266-13274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Suaud L., Li, J. Jiang Q. Rubenstein R.C. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

When Na+ in the ND96 bath buffer was replaced by the impermeant cation NMDG+, oocytes co-injected with G551D-CFTR and αβγ-ENaC had a 6-fold increased forskolin/IBMX-stimulated whole cell current compared with oocytes injected with G551D-CFTR alone (ICl = −5.1 ± 1.4-fold stimulation (ND96),n = 25, versus −6.3 ± 1.7-fold stimulation (NMDG-CL96), n = 18, p = n.s.) (Fig. 3). These data suggest that ENaC enhancement of forskolin/IBMX-mediated activation of G551D-CFTR is not dependent on extracellular Na+, Na+ influx, or inward Na+ conductance. G551D-CFTR exhibits a poor Cl−conductance in response to cAMP. As this might reflect the presence of alterations in other functional properties of this mutant, we examined whether genistein, which activates G551D-CFTR Cl−conductance, would restore functional interactions between G551D-CFTR and ENaC. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the amiloride-insensitive component of the forskolin/IBMX/genistein-stimulated whole cell current in oocytes co-expressing G551D-CFTR and αβγ-ENaC was 4-fold greater than the forskolin/IBMX/genistein-stimulated current measured in oocytes expressing G551D-CFTR alone (−0.3 ± 0.0 μA (G551D-CFTR,n = 21) versus −1.2 ± 0.4 μA (G551D-CFTR/ENaC, n = 20), p = 0.03). Consistent with our previous results (11Suaud L., Li, J. Jiang Q. Rubenstein R.C. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8928-8933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whole cell amiloride-sensitive currents modestly but significantly increased in response to 100 μm IBMX, 10 μm forskolin, and 50 μm genistein (−5.9 ± 1.3 μA (−forskolin/IBMX/genistein) versus −6.8 ± 1.3 μA (+forskolin/IBMX/genistein), n = 21, p= 0.05) in oocytes injected with ENaC alone (Fig. 4 B). Amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents recorded before and after stimulation by forskolin/IBMX/genistein in oocytes expressing ENaC and G551D-CFTR were significantly lower than the amiloride-sensitive currents obtained both before and after stimulation by forskolin/IBMX/genistein in oocytes expressing ENaC alone (Fig. 4 B). Although amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents significantly increased in oocytes expressing ENaC alone following stimulation by forskolin/IBMX/genistein (Fig. 4 B), amiloride-sensitive currents recorded in oocytes co-expressing ENaC and G551D-CFTR remained stable following stimulation with forskolin/IBMX/genistein (−2.1 ± 0.7 μA (−forskolin/IBMX/genistein) versus −2.0 ± 0.3 (+forskolin/IBMX/genistein), n = 20, p= n.s.). These data suggest that the activation of G551D-CFTR by forskolin/IBMX in the presence of genistein partially restored the inhibition of ENaC activity by activated G551D-CFTR and are similar to our observations for ΔF508-CFTR (11Suaud L., Li, J. Jiang Q. Rubenstein R.C. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8928-8933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We again assessed whether the enhanced forskolin/IBMX/genistein-stimulated amiloride-insensitive whole cell currents recorded in oocytes co-injected with G551D-CFTR and ENaC compared with oocytes injected with G551D-CFTR alone depended on ENaC-mediated sodium transport. Oocytes co-injected with G551D-CFTR and αβγ-ENaC had a 3.75-fold increased forskolin/IBMX/genistein-stimulated G551D-CFTR Cl− current compared with oocytes injected with G551D-CFTR alone both in ND96 (NaCl) buffer and in NMDG-Cl buffer (Fig. 5). These data suggest that ENaC enhancement of forskolin/IBMX/genistein-mediated activation of G551D-CFTR is not dependent on extracellular Na+, Na+ influx, or inward Na+ conductance. In Fig. 6, we have replotted the whole oocyte forskolin/IBMX-stimulated (Fig. 3, NMDG-Cl − ) or forskolin/IBMX/genistein-stimulated (Fig. 5,NMDG-Cl − ) currents and expressed these relative to that of oocytes injected with G551D-CFTR alone and stimulated with IBMX/forskolin. In co-injected oocytes (+ENaC), amiloride-insensitive forskolin/IBMX-stimulated currents increased 5.1-fold in the presence of ENaC and increased 14.6-fold in the presence of ENaC and genistein, whereas the amiloride-insensitive current increased only 3.9-fold in the presence of genistein alone. These data demonstrate synergistic activation of G551D-CFTR function by genistein and ENaC in the presence of forskolin/IBMX and suggest that genistein and ENaC enhance G551D-CFTR function in oocytes by different and complementary mechanisms. We next sought to assess the mechanism by which αβγ-mENaC increased G551D-CFTR-mediated current in co-injected oocytes. Oocytes were injected with G551D-CFTR alone or co-injected with ENaC, and G551D-CFTR was stimulated with forskolin/IBMX/genistein prior to single channel recordings of chloride transport (Fig. 7). At a pipette potential of −80 mV in the cell-attached mode, single channel currents in G551D-CFTR-injected oocytes (1.08 ± 0.13 pA, n = 6) were similar in magnitude to the currents recorded in oocytes co-expressing G551D-CFTR and ENaC (0.92 ± 0.14 pA, n = 6,p = n.s.). The P o for G551D-CFTR in oocytes co-injected with ENaC (0.24 ± 0.6, mean ± S.E.,n = 6) was not significantly different from that determined in oocytes injected with G551D-CFTR alone (0.29 ± 0.2,n = 6, p = n.s.). We did not observe a difference in number of G551D-CFTR channels/patch from oocytes injected with G551D-CFTR alone (n = 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, and 4 forn = 6 patches) or co-injected with G551D-CFTR and ENaC (n = 3, 1, 1, 4, 2, and 2 for n = 6 patches). Given the difficulties in estimating small changes in channel density from single channel analyses and the lack of a difference in G551D-CFTR open probability following stimulation with forskolin/IBMX/genistein in oocytes expressing G551D-CFTR alone or co-expressing G551D-CFTR and ENaC, our results are consistent with the increase in forskolin/IBMX/genistein-stimulated G551D-CFTR currents in the presence of ENaC, reflecting an increase in the number of G551D-CFTR channels at the plasma membrane. As genistein increases theP o for G551D-CFTR (22Weinreich F. Wood P.G. Riordan J.R. Nagel G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 434: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), these data are consistent with genistein and ENaC enhancing G551D-CFTR function in oocytes by different and complementary mechanisms. One hypothesis of the pathophysiology of the CF airway is that the absence of CFTR leads to increased ENaC activity in the airway epithelia, which results in increase solute and liquid absorption and decreased airway surface volume (23Knowles M.R. Boucher R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). This up-regulation of Na+ absorption in CF airways has been attributed to defective or absent regulatory interactions between ENaC and mutants of CFTR. Previous studies have suggested that regulatory interactions between CFTR and ENaC in airway epithelia are replicated inXenopus oocytes where functional expression of WT CFTR is associated with an inhibition of functional ENaC expression, making this system useful for studying these functional interactions. The forskolin/IBMX-regulated inhibition of ENaC by CFTR does not require expression of the full-length CFTR protein. The first nucleotide binding fold (nucleotide binding domain (NBD-1)) of CFTR in which G551D mutation is located seems important for this interaction. Forskolin/IBMX-dependent inhibition of ENaC can be observed when ENaC is co-expressed either with WT CFTR truncation mutants containing an intact first NBD-1 (24Schreiber R. Hopf A. Mall M. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5310-5315Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or with a WT CFTR peptide fragment containing NBD-1 and the regulatory (R) domain (14Kunzelmann K. Kiser G.L. Schreiber R. Riordan J.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A similar NBD-1/R peptide fragment containing the G551D mutation did not demonstrate forskolin/IBMX-regulated inhibition of ENaC (14Kunzelmann K. Kiser G.L. Schreiber R. Riordan J.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). G551D-CFTR when co-expressed with αβγ-ENaC and activated by IBMX/forskolin was unable to inhibit ENaC in our experiments. Similar results were obtained with ΔF508-CFTR where the mutation is also located in NBD-1 (11Suaud L., Li, J. Jiang Q. Rubenstein R.C. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8928-8933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These data suggest that form and/or function of NBD-1 are important in the inhibition of ENaC by CFTR and that genistein may improve ENaC regulation by mutant CFTR by influencing NBD-1. The importance of NBD-1 in this interaction is further suggested by our previous data regarding the interaction of ΔF508-CFTR and αβγ-mENaC. In these experiments, no ENaC-dependent increase in ΔF508-CFTR-mediated Cl− current or ΔF508-CFTR-mediated regulation of ENaC was observed until ΔF508-CFTR was further “repaired” with genistein (11Suaud L., Li, J. Jiang Q. Rubenstein R.C. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8928-8933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Genistein activates CFTR (WT, ΔF508, and G551D) (16al-Nakkash L., Hu, S., Li, M. Hwang T.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 464-472PubMed Google Scholar, 22Weinreich F. Wood P.G. Riordan J.R. Nagel G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 434: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) by increasing channel open time and decreasing channel closing, thereby increasing channel P o. Whereas the molecular details of this action remain elusive, some have suggested that genistein interacts directly with CFTR via the second nucleotide binding fold, NBD-2 (26Randak C. Auerswald E.A. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Reenstra W.W. Machleidt W. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This is consistent with genistein being able to activate both ΔF508- and G551D-CFTR as these two mutants have intact NBD-2s and further suggests that in some way an interaction of NBD-2 influences NBD-1 form and/or function. The increase in CFTR-mediated whole cell Cl− conductance when WT CFTR is co-expressed with αβγ-mENaC results from an increase in both CFTR open probability (10Jiang Q., Li, J. Dubroff R. Ahn Y.J. Foskett J.K. Engelhardt J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13266-13274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and in N, the number of CFTR Cl− channels expressed at the plasma membrane (4Konstas A.A. Koch J.P. Tucker S.J. Korbmacher C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25377-25384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 8Ismailov I.I. Awayda M.S. Jovov B. Berdiev B.K. Fuller C.M.

Engelhardt J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13266-13274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In oocyte co-injected with G551D-CFTR and αβγ-mENaC, the enhancement of G551D-CFTR Cl− current most probably correlates with an increase in the N or the number of Cl−channels present at the oocyte surface as the measured open probability of forskolin/IBMX/genistein-stimulated G551D-CFTR was the same in the presence or absence of ENaC. We also observed that amiloride-inhibited whole oocyte currents decreased with co-expression of G551D-CFTR (in these studies) or with WT CFTR in our previous studies (11Suaud L., Li, J. Jiang Q. Rubenstein R.C. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8928-8933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, we observed that ENaC functional expression was essentially unaltered by co-injection of ΔF508-CFTR (11Suaud L., Li, J. Jiang Q. Rubenstein R.C. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8928-8933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One potential explanation for these observations is that co-expression of ENaC increases G551D-CFTR N, whereas co-expression of G551D-CFTR could decrease either ENaC N or open probability. Previous studies in a number of systems have suggested that co-expression of WT CFTR decreases ENaC open probability (21Ling B.N. Zuckerman J.B. Lin C. Harte B.J. McNulty K.A. Smith P.R. Gomez L.M. Worrell R.T. Eaton D.C. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 594-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 27Stutts M.J. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14037-14040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar); however, such an effect on open probability was not noted for G551D-CFTR in lipid bilayers (8Ismailov I.I. Awayda M.S. Jovov B. Berdiev B.K. Fuller C.M. Dedman J.R. Kaetzel M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4725-4732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Our data do not directly address this issue, but if G551D-CFTR does not decrease ENaC open probability in oocytes (similar to its behavior in lipid bilayers), we can speculate that G551D-CFTR inhibits ENaC functional expression via an N effect. This effect might result from altered trafficking of ENaC to the oocyte membrane, changing its rate of retrieval from the plasma membrane or both. These considerations suggest that there may be multiple ways that CFTR and ENaC can interact. One interaction may be through competition for the folding/trafficking machinery. The co-expression of an appropriately folded and trafficked CFTR (G551D-CFTR as shown in Figs.2 and 4 or WT) (11Suaud L., Li, J. Jiang Q. Rubenstein R.C. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8928-8933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) would decrease the accessibility of this machinery for the folding and trafficking of ENaC, thereby decreasing ENaC functional expression and increasing CFTR functional expression. Conversely, co-expression of an inefficiently folded and trafficked CFTR (like ΔF508-CFTR) would not inhibit ENaC access to folding and trafficking machinery and result in unaltered functional ENaC expression in the presence of ΔF508-CFTR as we observed previously (11Suaud L., Li, J. Jiang Q. Rubenstein R.C. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8928-8933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Another potential site of interaction/competition between CFTR and ENaC is at the plasma membrane where cAMP-activated WT CFTR but not G551D-CFTR and ΔF508-CFTR inhibited ENaC function. One possibility is that both G551D-CFTR and ΔF508-CFTR undergo more rapid removal from the plasma membrane when compared with WT CFTR as has been suggested for ΔF508-CFTR (25Sharma M. Benharouga M., Hu, W. Lukacs G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8942-8950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that G551D-CFTR and ΔF508-CFTR, perhaps because of their aberrant NBD-1s, are not able to interact or interact differently with either ENaC or proteins important in transducing cAMP-activated CFTR signal to inhibit ENaC function. These considerations suggest a potential added level of complexity in considering pharmacologic repair of mutant CFTR function. Current investigational strategies, such as combinations of agents to improve CFTR trafficking such as 4-phenylbutyrate for ΔF508-CFTR, given together with genistein to activate the mutant CFTR and restore its interaction with ENaC may require further refinement. Additional agents that modulate ENaC functional expression when added to current combinations may further bolster such therapeutic strategies for pharmacologic repair therapy for mutant CFTR."

AT acts by inhibiting the tryptophan-activatedtrp RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP). AT is an oligomer of identical 53-residue polypeptides; it is produced in response to the accumulation of uncharged tRNATrp.

In Bacillus subtilis the genes of tryptophan metabolism are coordinately regulated in response to the cellular level of free tryptophan and the extent of charging of tRNATrp (1Babitzke P. Gollnick P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5795-5802Google Scholar). Tryptophan biosynthesis requires expression of the trpoperon (trpECDFBA) and an unlinked trp gene,trpG (2Gollnick P. Babitzke P. Merino E.

When the concentration of tryptophan is sufficiently high tryptophan binds to and activates the trpRNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP). 1The abbreviations used are: TRAP, trpRNA-binding attenuation protein; AT, anti-TRAP protein; HMB, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate; DTT, dithiothreitol; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1, 1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]glycine; PAR, 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; wt, wild type; ReAT, zinc-reconstituted AT. 1The abbreviations used are: TRAP, trpRNA-binding attenuation protein; AT, anti-TRAP protein; HMB, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate; DTT, dithiothreitol; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1, 1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]glycine; PAR, 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; wt, wild type; ReAT, zinc-reconstituted AT. Activated TRAP recognizes and binds to (G/U)AG repeat sequences in the trpoperon leader RNA, promoting formation of an RNA terminator structure and transcription termination (3Babitzke P. Yanofsky C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20494-20503Google Scholar, 7Du H. Tarpey R. Babitzke P. J.

The structures of tryptophan-activated TRAP and of an active TRAP-RNA complex have been reported (10Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Smith T.M. Yang M.

TRAP has 11 identical subunits arranged as a doughnut-shaped molecule. Tryptophan binds cooperatively to 11 binding sites in TRAP (12Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12452-12456Google Scholar) and is believed to promote a conformational change on the periphery of each TRAP subunit, activating its RNA-binding surface (13Yang M. Chen X. Militello K. Hoffman R. Fernandez B. Baumann C. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 696-710Google Scholar). The extent of charging of tRNATrp is also sensed inB. subtilis (9Sarsero J.P. Merino E. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2656-2661Google Scholar, 14Steinberg W. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 1023-1034Google Scholar, 15Valbuzzi A. Yanofsky C. Science. 2001; 293: 2057-2059Google Scholar). Uncharged tRNATrpaccumulation induces expression of an operon containing the genertpA (regulator of the TRAP protein, previously namedyczA) encoding the protein AT. Induction occurs by the T-box transcription antitermination mechanism (9Sarsero J.P. Merino E. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2656-2661Google Scholar, 16Henkin T.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 381-387Google Scholar). AT is a multimeric protein composed of identical 5.6-kDa subunits (15Valbuzzi A. Yanofsky C. Science. 2001; 293: 2057-2059Google Scholar). AT binds to the tryptophan-activated form of TRAP (15Valbuzzi A. Yanofsky C. Science. 2001; 293: 2057-2059Google Scholar). By masking the RNA-binding surface of TRAP, AT blocks the regulatory action of TRAP and inducestrp operon expression (17Valbuzzi A. Gollnick P. Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10608-10613Google Scholar). The predicted 53-residue sequence of AT shows remarkable similarity to the sequence of the cysteine-rich domain of the chaperone protein DnaJ (18Martinez-Yamout M. Legge G.B. Zhang O. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 805-818Google Scholar). In particular the signature motif CXXCXGXG, which is repeated four times in DnaJ, is present twice in the AT polypeptide (15Valbuzzi A. Yanofsky C. Science. 2001; 293: 2057-2059Google Scholar). The cysteine-rich domain of DnaJ is believed to be involved in the binding of unfolded protein substrates (19Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Google Scholar). Structure-function analyses with DnaJ of Escherichia coli revealed that this domain contains two Zn(II) atoms, each coordinated to four cysteine residues. The removal of zinc ions from DnaJ resulted in destabilization of its tertiary structure (20Banecki B. Liberek K. Wall D. Wawrzynow A. Georgopoulos C. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14840-14848Google Scholar). Deletion of the cysteine-rich region (20Banecki B. Liberek K. Wall D. Wawrzynow A. Georgopoulos C. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14840-14848Google Scholar) or substitution of pairs of cysteine residues by serine residues (19Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Google Scholar) significantly affected the activity of the protein. The spacing between the cysteine residues of DnaJ that chelate zinc is similar to that found in a family of C4 zinc finger proteins (19Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Google Scholar). However, the structure of the cysteine-rich domain of E. coli DnaJ reveals a unique fold in which an extended V-shaped structure is formed, and each Zn(II) ion is coordinated by pairs of cysteine residues that are far apart in the primary sequence (18Martinez-Yamout M. Legge G.B. Zhang O. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 805-818Google Scholar, 21Laity J.H. Lee B.M. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 39-46Google Scholar). In this article we present the results of studies on the possible roles of zinc and the cysteine residues of AT in determining the structure and function of the AT. We show that AT is indeed a metalloprotein and that zinc removal converts the protein into inactive monomers. The Zn(II) content of AT was determined, and the zinc/AT monomer molar ratio was found to be 1. All four cysteine residues appear to be essential for the integrity of the AT complex; substitution of any of the cysteine residues of AT by an alanine residue destabilizes the protein. The AT complex is shown to be a hexamer that appears to be composed of two trimers of AT chains. We propose a model for AT structure in which three Zn(II) ions are coordinated to cysteine residues from three polypeptide chains to assemble the trimer. Two trimers subsequently associate to form the hexamer. Purified native AT was prepared as described previously (17Valbuzzi A. Gollnick P. Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10608-10613Google Scholar). Zinc-free AT was prepared as follows: 8 molar equivalents of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (HMB) were added to 40 μm AT (monomer concentration) in 100 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.8 buffer. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and 8 additional eq of HMB were then added as well as EDTA to 2 mm (producing HMB-AT) (22Giedroc D.P. Keating K.M. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. Coleman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8452-8456Google Scholar). Following an additional 15 min of incubation, the mixture was centrifuged in a Microcon YM-3 device (Millipore), and the retained sample was washed three times with 100 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.8, containing 2 mm EDTA. Subsequently, the HMB reaction was reversed by incubating the recovered protein with the same Tris buffer containing 2 mm DTT plus 2 mm EDTA for 10 min at room temperature. This zinc-free AT preparation was concentrated by centrifugation in a fresh Microcon device, and the concentrate was diluted with metal-free water to lower the DTT concentration to 0.5 mm. Zinc-reconstituted AT (ReAT) was prepared as described for zinc-free AT, except that EDTA was omitted, no wash steps were performed to remove the displaced zinc, and instead the sample was treated with DTT immediately following the last incubation with HMB (no exogenous zinc was added). The buffers and water employed in these studies were treated with Chelex X-100 resin (Bio-Rad) overnight (5 g of resin per 100 ml) to remove free metal ions. Protein concentration was determined using the Advanced Protein Assay (Cytoskeleton). Cross-linking experiments were performed as described previously (15Valbuzzi A. Yanofsky C. Science. 2001; 293: 2057-2059Google Scholar), except that 0.5 μg of AT (various preparations) and 1 μl of 8% w/v glutaraldehyde were used in each reaction (10 μl total volume) in the presence of 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.8. In the time course experiment with native AT, 30 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.8, 20 mmNaCl, and 4 mm MgCl2 were present in each reaction mixture. In vitro transcription termination assays were performed as described previously (15Valbuzzi A. Yanofsky C. Science. 2001; 293: 2057-2059Google Scholar). The atomic absorption spectroscopy analysis for zinc in our purified AT preparation was performed by the Galbraith Laboratories. Mercurial promoted Zn(II) release experiments were performed in metal-free 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.8. In the HMB titration experiments, 1.25-μl aliquots of 1 mmHMB were added to a 500-μl cuvette containing 6 μm AT (monomer concentration). The reactants were mixed by inversion, and the absorbance at 250 or 500 nm was measured. When measurements were performed at 500 nm, 0.1 mm 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR) was present in the cuvette (Δε = 6.6 × 104m−1 cm−1 at 500 nm for the (PAR)2-Zn(II) complex) (20Banecki B. Liberek K. Wall D. Wawrzynow A. Georgopoulos C. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14840-14848Google Scholar). Cys → Ala substitutions were introduced in the AT sequence of a multicopy expression plasmid by multiple steps of PCR. For each substitution, in the first step two oligonucleotides were used that are complementary to each other and anneal to thertpA gene sequence but carry the desired nucleotide change. Each was used in combination with an external oligonucleotide that anneals to the vector sequence to perform PCR using the plasmid pDGrtpAwt (15Valbuzzi A. Yanofsky C. Science. 2001; 293: 2057-2059Google Scholar) as template. The two amplified products corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ portions of the rtpA gene and partially overlapping in the central mutagenized region were gel-purified. They were then mixed, annealed, and used as template for the second step of PCR performed with the two external oligonucleotides. The product obtained, carrying an rtpAgene sequence with the desired substitution, was cloned in pDG148, and the sequence was verified by sequencing. Each modified vector was transformed into a B. subtilis strain carrying a chromosomal deletion of the rtpA-ycbK region and a trppromoter-leader-trpE′-′lacZ translational fusion (9Sarsero J.P. Merino E. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2656-2661Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (15Valbuzzi A. Yanofsky C. Science. 2001; 293: 2057-2059Google Scholar). Cultures were grown under the conditions employed for β-galactosidase assays (15Valbuzzi A. Yanofsky C. Science. 2001; 293: 2057-2059Google Scholar) and were diluted to an A600 nm reading of 0.59. Cell pellets from 1 ml of culture were resuspended in 20 μl of SDS Tris·Tricine sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. 8.7 μl of sample were electrophoresed on SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels in Tris·Tricine buffer and then electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran BA79, Schleicher & Schuell). Immunoblotting was performed following the supplied instructions using rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against AT prepared by the Covance company. Bound antibody was visualized by use of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (AmershamBiosciences) and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent detection reagents (Pierce). The AT protein contains a putative zinc-binding domain similar to a portion of the cysteine-rich zinc-binding domain of DnaJ (15Valbuzzi A. Yanofsky C. Science. 2001; 293: 2057-2059Google Scholar). Atomic absorption spectroscopy was performed with a sample of pure AT (1 mg in 5 ml of 100 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm DTT) that was previously dialyzed overnight against Chelex X-100 (Bio-Rad) to remove free zinc from the buffer. The results obtained (Galbraith Laboratories) indicated that zinc was indeed present in the protein at a level of 1.5 ppm. This corresponds to 0.6 Zn(II) atoms per AT monomer. Zinc appeared to be tightly bound as incubation of AT with Chelex X-100 or chelators such as EDTA orN,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) had no noticeable effect on the stability of the protein (analyzed by native gel electrophoresis) or on its anti-TRAP activity (tested in the in vitro transcription termination assay) (data not shown). Based on AT-DnaJ similarity we expected the cysteine residues of AT to be involved in Zn(II) coordination. Therefore, we attempted to displace the intrinsic zinc by treating the protein with HMB. This compound, a strong sulfhydryl-binding reagent, has been widely used to remove zinc from metalloproteins and is generally incorporated at one molecule per –SH group (22Giedroc D.P. Keating K.M. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. Coleman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8452-8456Google Scholar, 23Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Schachman H.K. Ginsburg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14793-14803Google Scholar). Pure native AT was treated with HMB to produce HMB-AT. The displaced zinc was removed by addition of EDTA and multiple washings, and the treated AT was concentrated using a Microcon YM-3 filtration device. These steps were all performed in the presence of EDTA. Subsequently, the mercurial agent was removed by reversing the reaction with DTT to generate zinc-free AT. In a parallel experiment an aliquot of the same HMB-AT preparation was subjected to DTT treatment without the steps designed to remove the labilized zinc being performed, producing zinc-reconstituted AT. We examined AT subunit association in native AT, HMB-AT, zinc-free AT, and zinc-reconstituted AT using cross-linking with glutaraldehyde (Fig. 1). Under the conditions employed, the most efficiently cross-linked species observed with native AT was a trimer (predicted Mr = 16,800; Fig. 1, lane 1). After treatment with HMB, AT was reduced to the monomeric state (HMB-AT), indicating that displacement of zinc and incorporation of the mercurial agent destroyed the AT complex (Fig. 1, lane 2). However, when the HMB reaction was reversed in the presence of the labilized zinc, ReAT, the protein appeared to return to its original structure (Fig. 1,lane 3). Conversely, when the reaction was reversed following zinc elimination, most of the AT protein remained as monomer or formed aggregates of high molecular weight (Fig. 1, lane 4). Some trimer species were observed in the presumed zinc-free AT sample. This could be caused by incomplete removal of the zinc (Fig. 1,lane 4). Further incubation of zinc-free AT with 100 μm ZnCl2 did not restore the original trimeric structure, suggesting that the cysteine residues had been rendered incapable of coordinating Zn(II) (Fig. 1, lane 5). We believe that in the absence of zinc the free cysteine residues in the AT monomer undergo oxidation-forming Cys-Cys bridges that promote aggregation (in the various AT preparations the DTT concentration was lowered prior to analysis). In fact, when zinc-free AT was incubated with ZnCl2 in the presence of DTT, a pattern resembling that obtained with native AT was observed (Fig. 1, lane 6). We also compared the activities of these different AT preparations using an in vitro transcription termination assay (TableI). As expected, zinc-free AT had reduced ability to inhibit TRAP-dependent transcription termination in the leader region of the trp operon. The residual activity observed is probably caused by the fraction of native protein remaining in the preparation, because not all the zinc had been removed. From the values obtained with the native AT preparation we derived a saturation curve describing the inhibition by AT of TRAP-dependent transcription termination (15Valbuzzi A. Yanofsky C. Science. 2001; 293: 2057-2059Google Scholar). Based on this curve we estimate that 27% of the AT molecules in the zinc-free preparation are still functional. Incubation of zinc-free AT with ZnCl2 did not increase its activity. However, zinc-reconstituted AT was fully active (Table I), demonstrating that AT can regain both its original structure and function upon zinc re-incorporation.Table IFunctional analysis of AT subjected to Zn(II) removal and restorationAT preparationAT/TRAPaThe concentration of AT added in each reaction is expressed as molar excess over that of the TRAP protein present.% TbPercentage of transcripts that are terminated, the values in the table are the averages (± S.D.) of measurements from multiple experiments.No AT—cNo AT/TRAP molar ratio is expressed because no AT was present.63.5 ± 1.6Native AT5×d5-Fold molar excess.35.5 ± 8.6Native AT15×e15-Fold molar excess.11.5 ± 2.7Zinc-free ATfZinc-free AT was tested without zinc addition or following incubation with 100 μm ZnCl2 (+zinc).5×56 ± 3.3Zinc-free AT15×37 ± 9.8Zinc-free AT + zinc15×39 ± 11.4ReATg5×33.5 ± 8ReAT15×8 ± 2a The concentration of AT added in each reaction is expressed as molar excess over that of the TRAP protein present.b Percentage of transcripts that are terminated, the values in the table are the averages (± S.D.) of measurements from multiple experiments.c No AT/TRAP molar ratio is expressed because no AT was present.d 5-Fold molar excess.e 15-Fold molar excess.f Zinc-free AT was tested without zinc addition or following incubation with 100 μm ZnCl2 (+zinc). Open table in a new tab To obtain an independent and accurate measure of the zinc content of AT, we took advantage of the effective reaction between AT and HMB. It is possible to follow formation of the mercaptide bond between the free cysteine residues of AT and HMB by monitoring absorbance at 250 nm. If this assay is conducted in the presence of the high affinity metallochromic indicator PAR, release of Zn(II) ions, concomitant with HMB reaction with the sulfhydryl groups of AT, can be detected by monitoring absorbance at 500 nm (20Banecki B. Liberek K. Wall D. Wawrzynow A. Georgopoulos C. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14840-14848Google Scholar, 23Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Schachman H.K. Ginsburg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14793-14803Google Scholar). In our experiments, the absorbance at both 250 and 500 nm reached a plateau at a HMB/AT monomer molar ratio of 4.1 (Fig. 2). Because the same amount of HMB is required to saturate the cysteine residues and to exhaustively remove zinc from AT, it appears that all four cysteine residues are involved in tetrahedral coordination with Zn(II) ions. From the absorbance at 500 nm measured for HMB/AT mixtures at saturation, A500 nm = 0.397, we derived the concentration of the (PAR)2Zn(II) complex formed as 6.015 μm, which corresponds to the concentration of the zinc ions released by 6 μm AT (Δε = 6.6 × 104m−1 cm−1 at 500 nm for (PAR)2Zn(II) complex). Therefore, we unambiguously established the zinc/AT monomer molar ratio to be 1. Chemical cross-linking with bifunctional reagents can help elucidate important details about the structure of oligomeric proteins (24Azem A. Weiss C. Goloubinoff P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 253-268Google Scholar). As previously mentioned, in a standard 5-min reaction of glutaraldehyde with pure native AT, most of the protein appears to be cross-linked as a trimeric species. We decided to allow the cross-linking reaction to proceed for longer periods, analyzing identical AT samples incubated with glutaraldehyde for different lengths of time (Fig. 3). After 30 s of incubation the trimer species was already visible, and at all subsequent time points it appeared to be the most abundant product. Starting with 10 min of incubation, a new complex became evident, with a size matching the predicted molecular weight for an AT hexamer (Mr = 33,600). The progressive increase of the hexamer concentration with incubation time was paralleled by the gradual disappearance of the monomer and dimer species. Note that no intermediate species between trimer and hexamer are visible. This biphasic cross-linking pattern suggests that the fastest unit to be cross-linked is a trimer of AT chains. However, upon continued incubation the native form of AT, a hexamer composed of two trimers, is detectable. It is unlikely that in solution AT exists both as trimer and hexamer species, because native AT behaves as a single species when examined by gel-filtration chromatography or native gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The crucial role of zinc for the maintenance of AT stability and activity was confirmed by mutagenesis experiments. Mutant AT proteins, each lacking one of the four cysteine residues, were overproduced in B. subtilis using an isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible promoter in a multicopy plasmid construct (15Valbuzzi A. Yanofsky C. Science. 2001; 293: 2057-2059Google Scholar). Each of the mutant proteins had one of its four cysteine residues substituted by alanine. These substitutions were obtained by introducing a maximum of four nucleotide changes in the sequence of the wild type rtpAgene. Cell extracts of cultures presumably overexpressing wild type or mutant AT proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using an antiserum specifically directed against AT (Fig. 4). Visual inspection of the blot indicated that the AT levels in strains expressing Cys → Ala variant proteins were dramatically lower than the level observed in a strain producing the wild type protein. A possible explanation for this finding is that these variant proteins, each lacking one cysteine residue, are rapidly degraded. To examine AT lability further, the inducer IPTG was removed from each growing culture, and the cultures were reincubated for 1 h without IPTG. In these 1-h samples following IPTG removal, which had only a 16% increase in mass per culture, the mutant proteins were no longer detectable (Fig. 4). Thus, degradation is most likely responsible for the low levels of mutant AT proteins observed in the induced samples. In contrast, wild type AT was maintained at a stable level (Fig. 4). Two hours after IPTG removal, the wild type AT concentration decreased; this decrease was caused by dilution associated with cell growth (data not shown). Therefore, all four cysteine residues in the conserved DnaJ motif of AT appear to be essential for the stability of the AT polypeptide in vivo. The instability of the Cys → Ala mutant proteins does not exclude the possibility that these variant proteins are still able to interact with TRAP and exert an inhibitory action. Hence, we compared the activities of the mutant proteins with that of wild type AT expressed from the same plasmid by monitoring the effect of AT overexpression on β-galactosidase production by an integratedtrpE′-lacZ translational fusion (TableII). Overexpression of wild type AT completely inactivated TRAP, inducing high level β-galactosidase synthesis (15Valbuzzi A. Yanofsky C. Science. 2001; 293: 2057-2059Google Scholar). No increase in β-galactosidase activity was observed with any of the overexpressed mutant AT proteins (C12A, C15A, C26A, C29A). In all cases the β-galactosidase level detected was comparable to that of a control strain in which AT translation from the inducible construct was abolished (pDGSTOPrtpA).Table IIIn vivo analysis of the regulatory activity of different AT mutant proteinsPlasmidβ-Galactosidase activityaThe activity assayed is β-galactosidase expressed from the trpE′-lacZ fusion and is given in Miller units.pDGrtpAwt615pDGSTOPrtpA13pDGrtpAC12A12pDGrtpAC15A13pDGrtpAC26A13pDGrtpAC29A13a The activity assayed is β-galactosidase expressed from the trpE′-lacZ fusion and is given in Miller units. Open table in a new tab The rtpA gene of B. subtilis encodes a 53-residue polypeptide that associates with other AT polypeptides to form a multimeric protein that is an effective regulator of gene expression. AT is capable of binding to and inhibiting the activity of the tryptophan-activated form of the TRAP regulatory protein (15Valbuzzi A. Yanofsky C. Science. 2001; 293: 2057-2059Google Scholar, 17Valbuzzi A. Gollnick P. Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10608-10613Google Scholar). Thus AT is an anti-protein. The most notable feature of the amino acid sequence of AT is the presence of an array of cysteine and neighboring residues resembling the classical zinc finger motif; this arrangement most closely matches the signature motif of the cysteine-rich domain of the DnaJ family of proteins (15Valbuzzi A. Yanofsky C. Science. 2001; 293: 2057-2059Google Scholar, 18Martinez-Yamout M. Legge G.B. Zhang O. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 805-818Google Scholar). In the present study we examined the role of these conserved cysteine residues and established the importance of zinc binding for AT structure, function, and stability. We determined that AT does contain Zn(II), a ratio of one atom per monomer, and that all four cysteine residues in the conserved motif are involved in its coordination. Preliminary electrospray mass spectrometry analyses also showed one zinc atom per AT monomer. 2W. Burkitt, personal communication. Zinc was shown to be required to maintain the quaternary structure of the AT complex and its biological activity. Removal of the metal caused dissociation of the complex into single inactive chains. Zinc appears to protect the cysteine residues from oxidation; interestingly, this was also observed with DnaJ (20Banecki B. Liberek K. Wall D. Wawrzynow A. Georgopoulos C. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14840-14848Google Scholar). The crucial role of the cysteine residues of AT was confirmed by examining mutant AT proteins in vivo, each with a single Cys → Ala substitution. All four Cys → Ala substitutions had deleterious effects, with the resulting mutant AT proteins being rapidly degraded and showing no detectable anti-TRAP activity. Because the cysteine residues are involved in Zn(II) chelation and bound zinc appears to be essential for AT integrity and activity in vitro, we speculate that any cysteine substitution would eliminate zinc binding. Therefore, the corresponding mutant AT protein would exist as an unstable monomer. Apparently AT monomers are incapable of inactivating TRAP. Analysis of cross-linking of the subunits of native AT with glutaraldehyde indicated that the AT oligomer is a hexamer composed of two identical trimers. Based on the information collected in this study, and taking into consideration the peculiar fold of the DnaJ zinc-binding domain, we postulate a model for the AT complex (Fig. 5). We propose that three 5.6-kDa AT chains are associated by three Zn(II) ions, which are coordinated by pairs of cysteine residues belonging to different chains. A single type of interaction involving the cysteine residues near the N terminus of one chain with the cysteine residues near the C terminus of an adjacent chain would be the simplest way to bring the three subunits together into a trimer. Two assembled trimers would then interact to produce the AT hexamer. The disruptive effect of single cysteine substitutions in the AT mutagenesis experiments is consistent with each Zn(II) ion being coordinated by only two cysteine residues from the same chain; the equal importance of each of the four cysteine residues would favor our proposed symmetrical structure. In the highly reducing intracellular environment of the cell, ubiquitous zinc represents a convenient and economic vehicle for assembly and stabilization of protein domains or oligomers (25Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Google Scholar). The AT protein adds to the growing number of zinc-binding proteins that are distinct from the classical zinc-finger proteins in that they present novel types of folding (21Laity J.H. Lee B.M. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 39-46Google Scholar) and bind proteins rather than nucleic acids (25Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Google Scholar). We anxiously await a determination of the structure of AT and analyses of how AT forms specific inhibitory complexes with the 11-subunit tryptophan-activated TRAP regulatory protein.
