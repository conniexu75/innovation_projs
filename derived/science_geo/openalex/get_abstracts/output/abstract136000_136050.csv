https://openalex.org/W1630241876,"There is some discussion as to whether glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol(GPI)-anchored proteins occur in microdomains in the cell membrane. These putative microdomains have been implicated in processes such as sorting in polarized cells and signal transduction. Complexes enriched in GPI-anchored proteins, cholesterol and glycosphingolipids have been isolated from cell membranes by using non-ionic detergents: these complexes were thought to represent a clustered arrangement of GPI-anchored proteins. However, results obtained when clustering of GPI-anchored proteins induced by antibodies or by detergents was prevented support the idea of a dispersed surface distribution of GPI-anchored proteins at steady state. Here we use chemical crosslinking to show that membrane microdomains of a GPI-anchored protein exist at the surface in living cells. This clustering is specific for the GPI-anchored form, as two transmembrane forms bearing the same ectodomain do not form oligomers. Depletion of membrane cholesterol causes the clustering of GPI-anchored proteins to break up, whereas treatment of cells with detergent substantially increases the size of the complexes. We find that in living cells these GPI-anchored proteins reside in microdomains consisting of at least 15 molecules, which are much smaller than those seen after detergent extraction."

In this study, we employed epitope tagging, cell-surface biotinylation, and immunoprecipitation techniques to demonstrate that the CaR is expressed mostly in the form of a dimer on the surface of transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. Western analysis of cell-surface proteins under nonreducing conditions showed that the CaR exists in several forms with molecular masses greater than 200 kDa. Most of these high molecular mass forms of the receptor could be converted to a single monomeric species at 160 kDa under reducing conditions. This result suggests that the CaR forms dimers or even higher oligomers on the cell surface through intermolecular disulfide bonds that are sensitive to reducing agents. Consistent with this hypothesis, use of a cell-surface cross-linking agent substantially increases the proportion of the putative dimeric CaR at 280 kDa relative to the monomeric form of the receptor at 160 kDa under reducing conditions. Dimerization of the CaR in intact cells was further demonstrated when we co-transfected and co-immunoprecipitated the wild type, full-length receptor and a truncated form of the CaR lacking its cytoplasmic tail. Taken together, we conclude from these results that the functional CaR resides on the cell surface of transfected HEK293 cells in the form of a dimer.

The extracellular calcium (Ca2+o)-sensing receptor (CaR)1 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) (1Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J.

Activation of the CaR by elevated levels of Ca2+o stimulates phospholipase C and raises the cytosolic calcium concentration (Ca2+i). The physiological importance of the CaR in determining the level at which Ca2+o is set in vivo has been documented by the characterization of human syndromes resulting from activating or inactivating mutations of the CaR, which alter the function of parathyroid and kidney so as to produce hypo- or hypercalcemia, respectively (2Pollak M.R.

CaR-transfected HEK293 cells respond to Ca2+o with an EC50 of 4.1 ± 0.1 mm (the effective concentration of Ca2+o producing one-half of the maximal Ca2+i response). The concentration-response curve for the Ca2+o-elicited Ca2+i responses in CaR-transfected HEK293 cells exhibits a relatively high Hill coefficient of about 3. This large Hill coefficient suggests a substantial degree of positive cooperativity in the binding of ligand and/or G protein by the CaR, which may involve intra- or intermolecular interactions (e.g. via formation of homodimers); namely, binding of the first ligand or G protein increases the affinity of the second ligand or G protein. Intermolecular interactions leading to cooperativity, for example, could result from dimerization of GPCRs (e.g. as for the muscarinic receptor and rhodopsin), which has been suggested as the molecular basis for cooperativity in the binding of their respective agonists (10Potter L.T.

Our earlier biochemical studies had shown the presence of considerable amounts of CaR-specific, high molecular mass immunoreactivity by Western analysis, in addition to the putative monomeric form of the receptor, in membrane proteins prepared from both CaR-transfected HEK293 cells and native parathyroid cells (4Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). These high molecular mass species likely correspond to dimeric and trimeric CaRs. The presence of dimeric forms of the CaR has also recently been described in detergent extracts prepared with the inner medulla of the rat kidney (14Ward D.T. Brown E.M. Harris H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14476-14483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A structurally related GPCR, mGluR5, forms homodimers via intermolecular disulfide linkages within the amino-terminal extracellular domain. The extracellular domains of mGluR5 and the CaR share 17 cysteines in equivalent positions, raising the possibility that the CaR could also dimerize in this manner (15Romano C. Yang W.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28612-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In addition, several less structurally related GPCRs have been demonstrated to form homodimers, including the muscarinic receptor (16Avissar S. Amitai G. Sokolovsky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), β2-adrenergic receptor (17Venter J.C. Fraser C.M. Fed. Proc. 1983; 42: 273-278PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hebert T.E. Moffett S.

Codina J. Rich K.A. Rojas F.J. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9285-9294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and δ-opioid receptor (20Cvejic S. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26959-26964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). A noncovalent hydrophobic dimerization motif has been suggested to mediate homodimerization of the β2-adrenergic receptor (18Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), which was also present in the CaR. Therefore, the CaR can potentially dimerize through two distinct types of intermolecular interactions, i.e.noncovalent hydrophobic interactions and formation of covalent intermolecular disulfide bonds. In this report, using molecular and biochemical approaches, we show that the functional CaR normally resides on the cell surface mostly as a homodimer. The unusually high degree of cooperativity in the activation of the CaR by its polycationic agonists suggests that dimerization of the CaR is likely to have functional implications. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the approach described by Kunkel (21Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). The dut-1 ung-1 strain of Escherichia coli, CJ236, was transformed with cassette VI of a reconstructed CaR containing unique restriction sites introduced into the wild type human CaR as silent point mutations as described previously (4Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Uracil-containing, single-stranded DNA was produced by infecting the cells with the helper phage, VCSM13. The single-stranded DNA was then annealed to a mutagenesis primer, which contained a stop codon at the desired position and was flanked on both sides by a wild type sequence. The primer was then extended around the entire single-stranded DNA and ligated to generate closed circular heteroduplex DNA. DH5α-competent cells were transformed with the DNA heteroduplex, and incorporation of the desired mutation was confirmed in all cases by sequencing the entire cassette. Finally, the mutated cassette VIs were cloned into the XhoI and XbaI sites of the reconstructed CaR (4Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Cassette III in each of the mutant receptors was replaced with that in the Flag-tagged wild type receptor (9Bai M. Janicic N. Trivedi S. Quinn S.J. Cole D.E.C. Brown E.M. Hendy G.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1917-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) by double restriction digestion with AflII and NheI followed by ligation of the larger restriction fragments containing point mutations and the smaller restriction fragment containing the Flag-tag. The DNA for transfection was prepared using the Midi Plasmid Kit (QIAGEN). LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) was employed as a DNA carrier for transfection (22Hawley-Nelson P. Ciccarone V. Gebeyehu G. Jessee J. Felgner P.L. Focus. 1993; 15: 73-79Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's procedures. The HEK293 cells used for transient transfection were provided by NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Salt Lake City, UT) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). The DNA-liposome complex was prepared by mixing DNA and LipofectAMINE in Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubating the mixture at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA-LipofectAMINE mixture was then diluted with Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium and added to 90% confluent HEK293 cells plated on 13.5 × 20.1 mm glass coverslips using 0.625 μg of DNA (for measurement of Ca2+i) or in 100-mm Petri dishes using 3.75 μg of DNA (for obtaining protein for immunoprecipitation and Western analysis). After 5 h of incubation at 37 °C, equivalent amounts of Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium with 20% fetal bovine serum were added to the medium overlying the transfected cells, and the latter was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 24 h after transfection. The expressed Ca2+o-sensing receptor protein was assayed 48 h after the start of transfection. To perform co-expression of two receptors, 0.625 μg each of the two cDNAs were mixed and used to transfect HEK293 cells. Prior to preparing whole cell lysates, intact HEK293 cells transiently transfected with Flag-tagged CaR were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 1 mm ImmunoPure Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce), a membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent, at room temperature with constant agitation for 30 min to biotinylate the proteins on the cell surface. The reaction was then quenched by incubating the cells in 0.5m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 5 min. For cross-linking experiments, we added an appropriate amount of Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3), a noncleavable, membrane-impermeant cross-linker, into the labeling solution with ImmunoPure Sulfo-NHS-Biotin. The surface-biotinylated and/or cross-linked HEK293 cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, protease inhibitors, including 83 μg/ml aprotinin, 30 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml Pefabloc, 50 μg/ml calpain inhibitor, 50 μg/ml bestatin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin (1 × immunoprecipitation buffer), at room temperature. Insoluble material was removed by centrifuging the cell lysates at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected as total cell lysates. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). First, 5 μg of anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (VWR), 400 μl of H2O, 500 μl of 2 × immunoprecipitation buffer (see above), and 100 μl of total lysate containing approximately 500 μg of protein were added to a microcentrifuge tube. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Then, 5 μl of an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated, anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) was added to the mixture. The incubation was continued for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, 50 μl of 10% Protein A-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to the mixture for an additional 30-min incubation at 4 °C. The Protein A-agarose was washed three times with 1 × immunoprecipitation buffer, and the immunoreactive species were subsequently eluted in 60 μl of 2 × electrophoresis sample buffer at 65 °C for 30 min. The receptor of interest was detected by Western analysis. An appropriate amount of immunoprecipitated proteins from CaR-transfected HEK293 cells was subjected to SDS-containing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) using a linear gradient of polyacrylamide (3–10%). The proteins on the gel were subsequently electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% milk, the forms of the receptor present on the cell surface were detected using an avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) followed by visualization of the biotinylated bands with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After removal of the avidin using the recommended procedure for stripping the blots (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), all forms of the CaR on the same blot were detected using anti-CaR antiserum (4641, a polyclonal antiserum raised against a peptide within the extracellular domain of the CaR, kindly provided by Drs. Forrest Fuller and Rachel Simin at NPS) followed by a secondary, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody and then an Enhanced Chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Coverslips with nearly confluent HEK293 cells previously transfected with the appropriate CaR cDNAs were loaded for 2 h at room temperature with fura-2/AM in 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, containing 125 mm NaCl, 4 mmKCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% dextrose and were then washed once with a bath solution (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 125 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% dextrose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C for 20 min. The coverslips were then placed diagonally in a thermostatted quartz cuvette containing the bath solution, using a modification of the technique employed previously in this laboratory (24Fajtova V.T. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E151-E158PubMed Google Scholar). Extracellular calcium was increased stepwise to give the desired final concentrations with additions of Ca2+o in increments of 1 mm that were followed by 5 mm increments after achieving a level of 5.5 mm Ca2+o and 10 mm increments after reaching a level of 20 mm Ca2+o. Excitation monochrometers were centered at 340 nm and 380 nm with emission light collected at 510 ± 40 nm through a wide band emission filter. The 340/380 excitation ratio of emitted light was used to calculate Ca2+i as described previously (24Fajtova V.T. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E151-E158PubMed Google Scholar). The mean EC50 values for the wild type or truncated receptors determined in response to increasing concentrations of Ca2+o were calculated from the EC50 values for all of the individual experiments and were expressed with the standard error of the mean (S.E.) as the index of dispersion. Comparison of the EC50 values was performed using analysis of variance or Duncan's multiple comparison test (25Duncan D.B. Biometrics. 1955; 11: 1-42Crossref Google Scholar) (p ≤ 0.05). Each of the experiments described above in the experimental protocols was generally performed at least four times. To detect cell-surface expression of the CaR, we introduced the Flag epitope tag into the extracellular domain of CaR. The function as well as the pattern and overall level of expression of the Flag-tagged CaR are identical to those of the wild type receptor, as assessed by high Ca2+o-evoked Ca2+iresponses and Western analysis, respectively (9Bai M. Janicic N. Trivedi S. Quinn S.J. Cole D.E.C. Brown E.M. Hendy G.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1917-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Proteins on the cell surface of HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the Flag-tagged CaR or empty vector were first labeled with membrane-impermeant, Sulfo-NHS-Biotin prior to lysing the cells. The CaR was then immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag monoclonal antibody and eluted with SDS-sample buffer containing dithiothreitol (DTT) or no DTT. The free thiol groups of the native CaR were prevented from forming nonspecific disulfide bonds during protein preparation by including 100 mm iodoacetamide in the lysis buffer (see below). The immunopurified CaR was first detected with an avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate to visualize the forms of the receptor expressed on the cell surface. After removal of the avidin from the blot, the CaR was detected with a polyclonal anti-CaR antiserum (4Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), 4641, to detect both cell-surface and intracellular forms of the immunopurified receptor. On reduced SDS-PAGE, using avidin for detection we identified a major band at 160 kDa (the expected position of the mature monomeric CaR) in the sample immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody and reduced with DTT (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). When we detected with anti-CaR antiserum, in contrast, two immunoreactive bands (i.e. a doublet) were observed at the expected positions of the monomeric as well as the putative dimeric and higher multimeric CaRs (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). The surface forms of the monomeric receptor corresponded to the upper band of the doublet. With both methods of detection, the CaR-specific bands were not present in cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 1,A and B, lane 1). Therefore, the observed bands are specific for the CaR. To preserve specific intermolecular disulfide linkages, we surface-biotinylated and immunoprecipitated the CaR, but eluted the immunoprecipitated receptor with SDS-sample buffer lacking DTT. The monomeric CaR observed in Fig. 1 A, lane 2, was completely absent when nonreduced conditions were employed (see Fig. 2,lane 2). Instead, we detected two major bands between 200 and 300 kDa with avidin as well as one higher molecular mass species between 300 and 500 kDa for the wild type CaR (Fig. 2, lane 2). In this experiment, the control with DTT in Fig. 2, lane 1, showed a trace amount of a high molecular mass species at 280 kDa (the expected position of the dimeric CaR) in addition to the monomeric species. This 280-kDa band in Fig. 2, lane 1,lined up with the upper band of doublet observed between 200 and 300 kDa in Fig. 2, lane 2. It is likely that this 280-kDa band in Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2, represents a more denatured dimeric receptor than the lower band at 250 kDa in Fig. 2,lane 2, if both bands are homodimeric receptors. Next, to determine whether the dimerization is agonist-dependent, we preincubated the intact cells with high Ca2+o, e.g. 5 mm in 1 mm phosphate buffer, at 37 °C for 6 min prior to surface labeling. Under nonreducing conditions, the patterns of surface expression of the CaR were the same in cells stimulated and nonstimulated with high Ca2+o (data not shown), suggesting that activation of the receptor does not alter its degree of dimerization. It was important in these studies to prevent the formation of nonspecific disulfide linkages during protein preparation by including 100 mm iodoacetamide in the lysis buffer. Iodoacetamide is a compound chemically reactive with the sulfhydryls on cysteines and prevents the latter from forming disulfide bonds. As shown in Fig. 3, lane 2, inclusion of 100 mm iodoacetamide in the lysis buffer prevented the formation of a smear of CaR immunoreactivity (Fig. 3, lane 1) that otherwise was evident in Western blots performed using the CaR-specific antiserum. Therefore, the high molecular species observed in Figs. 2 and 3, lane 2, are not the artifacts because of formation of nonspecific disulfide bonds. To show that the putative dimers of the CaR observed on the cell surface were not artifacts of other types of nonspecific aggregation occurring during protein preparation, we stabilized pre-existing multimeric forms of the receptor on the cell surface by covalently linking them with BS3, a noncleavable, membrane-impermeant cross-linker, while we surface-labeled the cells with the Sulfo-NHS-Biotin. The surface-biotinylated and cross-linked cells were then lysed in the presence of iodoacetamide. The Flag-tagged wild type receptor was immunoprecipitated, and the immunoprecipitated CaR was eluted with DTT-containing, SDS-sample buffer. When we increased the concentration of cross-linker, the ratios of dimer to monomer increased progressively (Fig. 4 A). Without cross-linker, the monomer is the principal CaR species identified on the cell surface (Fig. 4 A, lane 1) while with 5 mmBS3, the dimer becomes the major species visible on the blot (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). This result confirms that the dimeric receptor is the principal species present on the cell surface. The reduction in intensities of overall surface labeling by the Sulfo-NHS-Biotin in the presence of BS3 occurs because both reagents form covalent bonds with the same pool of primary amines on the receptor. When we employed anti-CaR antiserum to detect CaR-immunoreactive proteins to assess sample loading after removal of the avidin, we found that the sample loaded in Fig. 4, lane 1, was somewhat less than others based on the CaR immunoreactivities of the intracellular species, i.e. the lower band at 140 kDa in Fig. 4 B, lane 1. Of interest, we found that the cross-linker did not change CaR immunoreactivity at 160 kDa in Fig. 4 B, unlike what we observed for the surface expression of the CaR in Fig. 4 A, and all CaR-immunoreactive bands had similar ratios of monomers relative to dimers or oligomers (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, the amount of the receptor on the cell surface must be sufficiently small that any changes in surface distribution between the monomeric and oligomeric forms as a result of cell-surface cross-linking does not produce any readily detectable alterations in the ratios of the intensities of the various CaR-immunoreactive bands when detected with anti-CaR antibody. To examine the role of the CaR cytoplasmic tail in dimerization, several receptors with varying degrees of truncation of their carboxyl-terminal tails were constructed. We introduced stop codons at amino acid positions 863 (located at the beginning of the cytoplasmic tail), 877, and 892; the respective receptors are referred to below as K863Stop, A877Stop, and S892Stop. The truncated receptors, K863Stop (data not shown), similar to a slightly longer receptor terminated at position 865 that has been documented to be inactive by Ray et al. (26Ray K. Fan G.F.

We then transfected HEK293 cells with the truncated receptors, surface-biotinylated the cells, and immunoprecipitated as above. Western analysis showed that the levels of expression of the truncated receptors were either similar to (K863Stop) or more than (A877Stop and S892Stop) that of the wild type receptor, and all three truncated receptors formed homodimers on the cell surface similar to the full-length, wild type receptor (Fig. 5) under nonreducing conditions. This result raised the possibility that the truncated receptors could form heterodimers with the full-length receptor when the two receptors were co-transfected, if high molecular weight species detected in nonreducing conditions (Fig. 5) were truly homodimers. Therefore, we next undertook studies to prove that the high molecular weight species of the various CaRs observed in Figs. 2 and 5,i.e. the wild type receptor and the truncated receptors, are indeed homodimers. To determine whether the full-length and truncated receptors associate, we co-transfected the nontagged truncated receptors with a Flag-tagged full-length receptor or Flag-tagged truncated receptors with a nontagged full-length receptor and immunoprecipitated the tagged receptors. If the nontagged and tagged receptors formed heterodimers, we would be able to co-immunoprecipite nontagged receptors with tagged receptors. Because monomeric full-length and truncated receptors can be resolved under reducing conditions on SDS-PAGE, we would be able to determine the relative amounts of tagged and nontagged receptors, which were associated during immunopurification prior to elution with SDS-sample buffer containing DTT, on Western blot using avidin as a probe if we surface-biotinylated the co-transfected cells. Subsequently, we would be able to determine the nature of the association, namely dimers or higher oligomers, on nonreduced SDS-PAGE. Fig. 6 A, lanes 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, and 13, shows that surface forms of nontagged receptors in co-transfected cells were co-immunoprecipitated using the anti-Flag antibody, which was resolved from co-transfected tagged receptors on a reduced SDS-PAGE and detected with avidin. As a control, the nontagged receptors isolated from singly transfected cells could not be immunoprecipitated by anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 6 A, lanes 1, 10, 12, and 14). On nonreduced PAGE, only oligomers (mostly dimers) were detected, and no monomeric forms of either full-length or truncated receptors were detected on the surface of co-transfected cells (Fig. 6 B). As shown in Fig. 6 A, the intensity of the Flag-tagged receptor was higher than that of the nontagged receptor, indicating that besides the heterodimers, there were substantial amounts of the homodimers of each of the co-transfected receptors. Of interest, the expression of the full-length receptor was significantly increased in cells co-transfected with S892Stop (Fig. 6 A, lane 13) compared with that in cells transfected with the full-length receptor alone (Fig. 6A, lane 8). The cross-linking and co-immunoprecipitation experiments carried out in the present study, together with Western analysis of cell-surface CaR under nonreducing conditions, clearly demonstrate that the CaR resides on the cell surface mostly as a dimer and possibly as higher oligomers but hardly at all as a monomer. Formation of homodimers between cytoplasmic tail-truncated receptors suggests that the cytoplasmic tail is not necessary for homodimerization. Unlike epidermal growth factors, platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor receptors, which undergo ligand-induced dimerization upon activation (27Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar), the dimerization of the CaR is not agonist-dependent. Fig. 3 shows that iodoacetamide blocks nonspecific aggregation of the CaR in whole cell lysates. Because iodoacetamide blocks the thiol groups on free cysteines from forming disulfide bonds with other free cysteines in the vicinity, the aggregates formed in the absence of iodoacetamide were most probably because of oxidation of the three cysteines that are present in the cytoplasmic tail of the CaR during the preparation of cellular proteins for gel electrophoresis. In the intact cell, these intracellular cysteines likely remain in a reduced form because of the strongly reducing intracellular environment maintained by the glutathione system (28Schulz G.E. Schirmer R.H. Cantor C.R. Principles of Protein Structure. 1st Ed. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1985: 53-55Google Scholar). Indeed, no such nonspecific aggregation was observed with a mutant CaR in which the entire carboxyl-terminal tail was deleted, even in the absence of iodoacetamide. 2M. Bai, unpublished observation. The majority of the surface dimeric form of the CaR and higher oligomers of the receptor observed under nonreducing conditions is readily converted to a single form of the monomeric receptors with a molecular mass of 160 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig. 2). Our earlier biochemical studies had shown that there are three monomeric forms of the CaR in crude membrane preparations of CaR-transfected HEK293 cells with molecular masses of 120, 140, and 160 kDa on reduced SDS-PAGE. These forms of the receptor represent the nonglycosylated CaR and receptors with varying types and extent of glycosylation (4Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), respectively. The 160-kDa species contains N-linked complex carbohydrates that we refer to as the mature form, whereas the 140-kDa species contains N-linked, high mannose-containing carbohydrates. The exclusive conversion of the surface CaR to a single form of monomeric receptor (160 kDa, Fig. 2, lane 1) suggests that only the CaR N-glycosylated with complex carbohydrate reaches the cell surface. In other words, biosynthetic intermediates, such as the immature forms of the CaRN-glycosylated with high mannose (140 kDa), fail to arrive at the cell surface. The sensitivity of the dimeric receptor to reducing agents suggests that one type of intermolecular interaction mediating dimerization is intermolecular disulfide bonds. It is likely that the cysteine(s) involved in the intermolecular disulfide bond(s) of the CaR are located in the same general region identified in mGluR5 (15Romano C. Yang W.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28612-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), because mGluR5 and the CaR share the relative positions of 20 cysteines. These shared cysteines may form either intramolecular disulfide bonds that are involved in the correct folding of both the CaR and mGluRs or intermolecular disulfide bonds for dimerization of these two receptors. It has been shown that the cysteine(s) involved in the intermolecular disulfide linkage of dimeric mGluR5 are located within about 17 kDa of the amino terminus (15Romano C. Yang W.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28612-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In this region, the CaR has six cysteines, including two within the putative signal peptide that are likely cleaved off by signal peptidase during biosynthesis of the receptor. Therefore, one or more of the four cysteines located within 17 kDa of the amino terminus and/or some of the nonconserved cysteines present in CaR may be involved in forming intermolecular disulfide bonds. Moreover, we noted putative dimers even in the presence of reducing agents when we detected the CaR with either avidin, to detect cell-surface expression (Figs. 2 and 4 A), or an anti-CaR antiserum (4641) to assess the overall level of CaR protein expression (Figs. 1 B and 4 B), including both the mature and immature forms. It has been suggested that a noncovalent hydrophobic dimerization motif in the β2-adrenergic receptor (18Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) mediates the formation of a functionally important homodimer that is SDS-resistant. Interestingly, this consensus dimerization motif for noncovalent hydrophobic interactions is also present in the CaR within TM5 (LMALGFLIGYTCL, note that the conserved amino acids forming the putative intermolecular interface are underlined). Molecular modeling of GPCRs has suggested that TM5 is one of the most membrane-exposed of all the transmembrane segments, likely making this motif in one receptor molecule accessible to the same motif in another receptor molecule (29Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that P747frameshift (a mutation identified in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia syndrome with a single-base deletion as well as a separate transversion in codon 747, which normally encodes proline, thereby resulting in a frameshift and a truncated CaR lacking TM5 and the rest of carboxyl terminus) can no longer form an SDS-resistant dimer in the presence of 100 mm DTT (5Pearce S.H. Bai M. Quinn S.J. Kifor O. Brown E.M. Thakker R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1860-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, the CaR's putative dimerization motif in TM5 could contribute to the formation of dimers of the receptor and/or stabilization of dimeric CaR during post-translational processing. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the CaR resides on the cell surface as homodimers that likely represent the active form of the receptor and contribute to the high degree of apparent cooperativity observed for the CaR. It is likely that the wild type and mutant CaRs form heterodimers in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia patients carrying a normal CaR on one allele and an abnormal CaR on the other. Furthermore, dominant negative phenotypes present in some familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia patients suggest that formation of heterodimers between wild type and mutant receptors may negatively affect the function of the normal receptor in the heterodimeric complex. For example, a purely random association of the mutant receptor with either wild type CaRs or with other mutant receptors in the heterozygous state in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia could potentially reduce the level of the wild type homodimer to approximately one-quarter of that present in normal individuals.

The pharmacological profiles of GALR1 and GALR2 are similar to one another in that both show a preference for the N-terminal portion of the galanin peptide, and chimeric “antagonist” peptides such as M35 and M40 act as full agonists at both cloned receptors (11Smith K.E.

Recently, the cloning of a third galanin receptor cDNA was described by Wanget al. (22Wang S.K. He C.G. Hashemi T. Bayne M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31949-31952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), but the pharmacological characterization of this receptor was limited by an extremely low apparentB max in porcine 125I-galanin binding assays, and no functional coupling was reported. We now report the cloning and functional characterization of a third galanin receptor subtype, termed GALR3, from the rat hypothalamus based on a combination of expression and homology cloning methods. We have also isolated and characterized the functional human homologue of GALR3. Both human and rat GALR3 receptors exhibit pharmacological profiles distinct from GALR2 and GALR1. Moreover, we have shown that galanin acting at GALR3 receptors can activate GIRK currents in Xenopus oocytes, demonstrating that GALR3 can couple to a G-protein of the Gi/Go class. The cloning and characterization of rat and human GALR3 receptors will facilitate the association of functional roles with specific galanin receptor subtypes and will help to circumscribe the properties of any remaining uncloned galanin receptors. A rat hypothalamus cDNA library in λZAP II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened using overlapping oligonucleotide probes representing the transmembrane domains of the rat GALR2 receptor cDNA (11Smith K.E. Forray C. Walker M.W. Jones K.A. Tamm J.A. Bard J. Branchek T.A. Linemeyer D.L. Gerald C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24612-24616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The oligomers were labeled, and hybridizations were performed at reduced stringency as described (23Bard J.A. Walker M.W. Branchek T.A. Weinshank R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26762-26765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The cDNA insert from one hybridizing clone, rHy35a, was sequenced on both strands by cycle sequencing with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase FS (Perkin-Elmer), and products were run on an automated fluorescent sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Sequence analysis (GCG Version 9.1, Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI) indicated that rHy35a represented a fragment of a novel galanin-like receptor. A rat hypothalamus plasmid cDNA library consisting of 1.2 × 106 primary clones (average insert size of ∼3.2 kilobase pairs) was constructed, processed, and screened for porcine125I-galanin binding/photoemulsion detection as described (11Smith K.E.

Groups of primary hypothalamic cDNA library pools (10 pools of ∼3200 colony-forming units/pool) were screened by polymerase chain reaction using primers specific for rHy35a; primary pools (20Crawley J.N.

The slide corresponding to pool K163 exhibited positive galanin binding and also contained the rHy35a sequence. The cDNA encoding the new galanin receptor was isolated by sib selection (24McCormick M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 151: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and sequenced on both strands using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase FS. A human placenta genomic library in λDASH II (≈1.5 × 106 total recombinants; Stratagene) was screened at reduced stringency using GALR2 transmembrane domain probes as described above. One positive phage clone, plc21a, contained a 2.7-kilobase pair KpnI/EcoRI fragment that hybridized with the rat GALR2 transmembrane domain II oligonucleotide probe. Subcloning and sequence analysis revealed that the fragment encoded the first three transmembrane domains of the human GALR3 receptor as well as a large intron. To obtain additional exons encoding the receptor, the original phage clone plc21a (∼18-kilobase pair insert) was hybridized with probes directed to the third extracellular loop or transmembrane IV regions of the rat GALR3 cDNA. The full-length human GALR3 construct was prepared by ligating a polymerase chain reaction-derived product of the 5′-exon, representing the starting Met through the III/IV loop, with a genomic fragment containing the 3′-exon. The calcium phosphate technique (25Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) was used to co-transfect receptor cDNA plus a G418-resistant plasmid into mouse fibroblast LMTK− cells for human GALR3 studies or into human embryonic kidney 293 cells for rat GALR3 studies. Stable clones were selected with G418 and screened as membrane preparations for specific porcine 125I-galanin binding. By the same protocol, rat GALR1 receptors were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and rat GALR2 receptors in LMTK−cells. Supplements (10% bovine calf serum, 4 mml-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) were added to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for the culture of mouse fibroblast LMTK− and human embryonic kidney 293 cells or to Ham's F-12 medium for Chinese hamster ovary cells. Cells were grown on 150-mm plates at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Stock plates were split with trypsin every 3–4 days at a ratio of 1:6 for 293 cells, 1:8 for Chinese hamster ovary cells, or 1:10 for LMTK− cells. Membranes were prepared from transfected cells, and protein was measured as described previously (11Smith K.E. Forray C. Walker M.W. Jones K.A. Tamm J.A. Bard J. Branchek T.A. Linemeyer D.L.

Membranes, peptides, and porcine 125I-galanin (2200 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) were diluted in galanin binding buffer supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% bacitracin and then distributed into 96-well Millipore GF/C filter plates (pretreated for 30 min with 1% polyethyleneimine in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) so that the 125I-galanin concentration was ∼375,000 dpm/sample for GALR3 and ∼187,500 dpm/sample for GALR1 and GALR2. Following incubation at room temperature for 120 min, membranes were collected by filtration, and125I was measured by liquid scintillation. Nonspecific binding was defined by 1 μm porcine galanin. Saturation and displacement binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression and are reported as mean ± S.E. The sequences comprising the coding regions of rat and human GALR3 were subcloned into pBS KS+AMV-pA50 (26Nowak M.W. Kearney P.C. Sampson J.R. Saks M.E. Labarca C. Silverman S.K. Zhong W. Thorson J.

All mRNAs were transcribed using T7 polymerase (Message Machine, Ambion Inc.). Oocytes received 2 ng each of GIRK1 and GIRK4 mRNAs in combination with 5–25 ng of receptor mRNA; after injection, oocytes were incubated at 17 °C for 3–8 days. Dual-electrode voltage clamping was performed using microelectrodes with resistances of 1–3 megaohms. During the application of agonists, oocytes were superfused in high K+ medium containing 48 mm KCl, 49 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Solution hybridization/ribonuclease protection assays were used to detect rat GALR3 receptor transcripts in mRNA isolated from rat tissues. A 445-base pair fragment of the rat GALR3 cDNA (nucleotides 1061–1506) flanked by RNA polymerase promoter sequences was used to synthesize a radiolabeled GALR3 cRNA probe using standard methods and reagents (Promega).

Based on the potential presence of multiple galanin receptors in the hypothalamus, we attempted to isolate additional galanin receptors using both homology and expression cloning strategies. The convergence of these strategies resulted in the isolation of a partial galanin receptor-like cDNA fragment (rHy35a) by reduced stringency homology cloning and the discovery of the same fragment in a galanin-binding library pool (K163, ∼3200 primary clones) identified by expression cloning. Isolation of the full-length cDNA from pool K163 of the rat hypothalamus expression library and subsequent transfection/radioligand binding confirmed that the cDNA encoded a novel rat galanin receptor, termed GALR3. The human homologue of GALR3 was subsequently isolated from a human placenta genomic library and subcloned for sequencing and expression studies. The rat GALR3 cDNA can encode a protein of 370 amino acids with 35% amino acid identity to rat GALR1 (10Parker E.M. Izzarelli D.G. Nowak H.P. Mahle C.D. Iben L.G. Wang J. Goldstein M.E. Brain Res.

The sequence similarity to GALR2 is higher within transmembrane domains II–IV, where amino acid identities range from 70 to >90%. The human GALR3 receptor comprises 368 amino acids with 90% identity to rat GALR3 (Fig. 1); compared with human galanin receptor subtypes, GALR3 is 37 and 57% identical to human GALR1 (9Habert-Ortoli E.

In accord with its high level of sequence identity to GALR2, the human GALR3 gene contains an intron within the coding region at the same location as reported for rat GALR2 (11Smith K.E. Forray C. Walker M.W. Jones K.A. Tamm J.A. Bard J. Branchek T.A. Linemeyer D.L. Gerald C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24612-24616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 34Howard A.D.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Notably, the amino acid sequences for the rat and human GALR3 receptors shown here (Fig. 1) differ from previous preliminary reports: the sequence of human GALR3 differs by 6 amino acids from that of an unannotated receptor-like sequence in GenBankTM (EM_HTG:HS81I2), and the rat GALR3 receptor differs by 4 amino acids from another galanin receptor also described as GALR3 by Wang et al. (22Wang S.K. He C.G. Hashemi T. Bayne M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31949-31952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Both rat and human GALR3 receptor sequences contain a single consensus site forN-linked glycosylation in the N terminus (see Fig. 1) and several predicted intracellular sites for phosphorylation by protein kinases; one putative phosphorylation site common to rat and human GALR3 in the third intracellular loop is absent in GALR1 and GALR2. To assess the distribution of GALR3 mRNA in the rat, we carried out solution hybridization/RNase protection assays on poly(A)+RNA isolated from a variety of tissues and brain regions (Fig. 2). GALR3 transcripts were broadly distributed, but present at low abundance within the rat central nervous system and many peripheral tissues. Among all tissues examined, the highest levels of GALR3 mRNA were found in the rat hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Within the central nervous system, lower levels were observed in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, medulla oblongata, caudate putamen, cerebellum, and spinal cord; no GALR3 mRNA was detected in the hippocampus or substantia nigra. In peripheral tissues, areas containing low levels of GALR3 included the liver, kidney, stomach, testicle, and adrenal cortex. Additionally, GALR3 mRNA was found in the lung, adrenal medulla, spleen, and pancreas (data not shown). GALR3 transcripts were not detected in RNA extracted from the heart, uterus, vas deferens, choroid plexus, or dorsal root ganglion. This localization pattern suggests that GALR3 may contribute more to galanin-mediated physiology in the rat hypothalamus and pituitary than in other areas. However, the up-regulation of galanin peptide expression in a variety of pathophysiological states (2Wiesenfeld-Hallin Z. Xu X.J. Langel U. Bedecs K. Hokfelt T. Bartfai T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3334-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 35Chan-Palay V. Adv. Neurol. 1990; 51: 253-255PubMed Google Scholar, 36Schreiber R.C. Hyatt-Sachs H. Bennett T.A. Zigmond R.E.

Radioligand binding assays were conducted to characterize the cloned GALR3 receptor homologues. Porcine125I-galanin bound in specific and saturable fashion to membranes from cells stably transfected with either human or rat GALR3. Data generated from experiments in which porcine125I-galanin concentrations ranged from 0.5 pmto 3.0 nm were best fit to a one-site model. Apparent pK d and B max values are listed in Table I. For comparison, rat GALR1 and GALR2 receptors were studied under similar conditions. Data in Table I show that both the observed binding affinity of porcine125I-galanin and the measurable B maxwere lowest for the GALR3 receptors.Table ISaturation binding studies with porcine 125I-galaninReceptorCellApparent pK d ± S.E.(K d)ApparentB maxnfmol/mg ± S.E.Rat GALR1CHO1-aCHO, Chinese hamster ovary.9.84 ± 0.08(0.145 nm)21,400 ± 45005Rat GALR2LMTK−9.53 ± 0.07(0.293 nm)5800 ± 4903Rat GALR32939.01 ± 0.08(0.981 nm)460 ± 306Human GALR3LMTK−8.65 ± 0.05(2.23 nm)1530 ± 1703Membranes from cells stably transfected with cloned galanin receptors were analyzed in filtration binding assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-a CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. Open table in a new tab Membranes from cells stably transfected with cloned galanin receptors were analyzed in filtration binding assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The rat GALR3 receptor bound galanin and related peptide analogues in porcine 125I-galanin binding assays with a distinctive rank order of binding affinity (Table II): rat galanin, porcine galanin, porcine galanin-(−7 to +29) > human galanin, porcine galanin-(1–16) > porcine galanin-(3–29). The chimeric peptides bound to rat GALR3 with a distinctive rank order: M32, C7, M35, galantide > M40. Comparison with the other cloned rat galanin receptor subtypes indicates that apart from quantitative differences, rat GALR3 shares certain features in common with rat GALR1 despite the high degree of sequence divergence. For example, both receptor subtypes display the lowest affinity for M40 out of all the chimeric peptides studied, and both receptors are sensitive to galanin C-terminal truncation, with lower affinity for porcine galanin-(1–16)versus porcine galanin. Also, GALR3 and GALR1 receptors are sensitive to N-terminal modification in having decreased affinity for [d-Trp2]galanin versus galanin and no detectable binding affinity for porcine galanin-(3–29), the latter being a common feature of all three cloned galanin receptor subtypes. In accord with its high level of amino acid identity to GALR2, GALR3 maintains moderate affinity for galanin-(2–29) (22Wang S.K. He C.G. Hashemi T. Bayne M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31949-31952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In sharing a general preference for the conserved N-terminal portion of the galanin peptide, all three cloned receptors are thus distinct from the galanin receptor subtypes activated by C-terminal fragments of galanin (14Wynick D.

In an effort to identify intracellular proteins expressed by activated T cells that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of β1-integrin (CD29), we used the β1-integrin cytoplasmic domain as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. Here we report that the cytoplasmic domain of β1-integrin specifically interacts with the cytoskeletal protein filamin. This interaction required all but the most carboxyl-terminal three residues of the cytoplasmic domain of β1, and the carboxyl-terminal 477 residues of filamin containing the terminal 4.5 ∼96-residue tandem repeats of filamin. To verify this interaction in vivo, we showed that filamin specifically coprecipitated with β1 in mammalian cells. We also showed that recombinant filamin chimeric proteins were able to bind to the β1 cytoplasmic domain in vitro. We observed that a subset of single point mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of β1, which had been previously reported to impair its function, disrupt the interaction between β1and filamin. Taken together, these findings suggest that the interaction between β1 and filamin, which in turn can bind actin, provides a mechanism for the interaction of this cell surface receptor with cytoskeletal proteins and that this interaction plays a role in normal receptor function.

The integrins are a family of closely related heterodimeric cell surface receptors, which play an important role in mediating cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8988) Google Scholar). The integrins are composed of an α chain, which is associated with a β chain. To date, 16 α chains and 8 β chains have been characterized at the molecular level. Each α and β chain combination results in a cell surface receptor with a unique ligand specificity. Although both chains are required for ligand binding, it appears that the interaction of integrins with cytoplasmic proteins is predominantly mediated by cytoplasmic residues of the β chain. Typically, integrins are expressed in a low affinity conformation on the surface of resting cells. Cell activation can result in increased numbers of receptors; however, more importantly, cellular activation results in a transient change in receptor affinity that is critical for receptor-ligand interaction. The β1-integrin (CD29) family of receptors is composed of at least 10 members by virtue of the association of β1with at least 10 different α chains, α1–α9, and α v. This family of receptors is involved in mediating interactions between cells and extracellular matrix proteins including laminin, fibronectin, collagen, and vitronectin. We have been particularly interested in studying the α4β1 (VLA-4, or very late antigen-4; CD49d/CD29) receptor. This protein has been shown to have at least two ligands, the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin (2Wayner E.A. Garcia-Pardo A. Humphries M.J. McDonald J.A. Carter W.G. J.

Both β1 integrins and VCAM-1 have been shown to be critical for normal development. Mice lacking β1 are not viable (7Fassler R. Meyer M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1896-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), and studies with chimeric mice lacking expression of β1 in blood cells and hematopoietic cells indicate that hematopoietic stem cells lacking β1 can differentiate normally but are unable to populate the fetal liver (8Hirsch E. Iglesias A. Potocnik A.J. Hartmann U. Fassler R. Nature. 1996; 380: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the majority of mice lacking VCAM-1 have abnormal placental development and die at the embryo stage within 3 days (9Gurtner G.C. Davis V. Li H. McCoy M.J. Sharpe A. Cybulsky M.I.

In mature individuals the interaction between VLA-4 and its two ligands plays an important role in regulating the recruitment and migration of leukocytes to sites of inflammation. Interactions between VLA-4 and VCAM-1 are in part responsible for mediating the adhesion of leukocytes to activated vascular endothelial cells (11Carlos T.M. Schwartz B.R. Kovach N.L. Yee E. Rosso M.

The contribution of α4 to the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation in mature animals has been demonstrated by examining the effects of anti-α4mAbs1 in various models of immune disease. Antibodies directed against α4, VLA-4, and VCAM-1 have been shown to block antigen-induced eosinophil and T cell infiltration into bronchial tissue (16Pretolani M. Ruffie C. Lapa e Silva J.-R.

Using an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, anti-α4 antibodies have been shown to prevent the accumulation of lymphocytes in the central nervous system and the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (18Yednock T.A. Cannon C. Fritz L.C. Sanchez M., F. Steinman L. Karin N. Nature. 1992; 356: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). Antibodies to α4 and VCAM-1 have also been shown to delay the onset of diabetes in an adoptive transfer model of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and block lymphocyte infiltration of the islets of Langerhans (19Baron J.L. Reich E.-P. Visintin I. Janeway C.A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1700-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Anti-α4 antibodies also lower leukocyte infiltration at sites of inflammation in an in vivo contact hypersensitivity model (20Ferguson T.A. Kupper T.S. J.

These effects may reflect blocking of the interaction between VLA-4 and/or α4/β7-integrins and their respective ligands. In a similar experiment, a soluble VCAM-1-Ig fusion protein was shown to inhibit the onset of insulin-dependent diabetes in an adoptive transfer model and delay the appearance of islet-specific leukocyte infiltration (22Jakubowski A.

We have been interested in the interaction between VLA-4 and VCAM-1 and have examined the role of this interaction in cell adhesion and signaling.

In this report, we describe the use of the yeast two-hybrid system to identify an interaction between the cytoskeletal protein filamin and the cytoplasmic domain of β1. This interaction was verified by examining the ability of filamin to coimmunoprecipitate with β1 in the Jurkat T cell line. Additionally, we show that recombinant filamin chimeric proteins were able to bind to the β1 cytoplasmic domain in vitro. We also show results of experiments that define the minimal regions of β1 and filamin required for their interaction. Finally, we show that mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of β1, which had previously been shown to disrupt β1 function, prevent filamin binding. Taken together, this work suggests that the molecular interaction between β1 and filamin plays a critical role in the function of the β1-integrin in vivo. The cytoplasmic domain of the β1-integrin subunit (CD29) containing residues 757–803 was obtained by PCR and cloned in-frame into the GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4bd; bait) vector pGBT9 (CLONTECH). The GAL4bd-β1 vector was cotransformed with an activated human leukocyte cDNA expression library fused to the activation domain of GAL4 (GAL4ad; prey) in the pGAD10 vector (CLONTECH) into the yeast strain HF7c using the method of Schiestl and Gietz (33Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). Prey plasmids were recovered from transformants that exhibited β-galactosidase activity and were tested in a cotransformation assay with GAL4bd-β1 or control heterologous baits. To assay for β-galactosidase activity, individual yeast transformants were patched onto filter paper, grown overnight at 30 °C, then incubated with the chromogenic substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactosidase according to the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH). To examine the ability of filamin truncations to interact with the cytoplasmic tail of β1, the GAL4bd-β1vector was cotransformed with individual filamin truncations, fused to the activation domain of GAL4 in the pGAD424 vector (CLONTECH), into Y190 yeast cells. Colonies selected for growth in the absence of leucine and tryptophan were assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described above. To examine the ability of the β1 truncations and point mutants to interact with the original filamin clone, GAL4bd vector containing the individual β1 truncations or point mutants were cotransformed with the pGAD10 vector containing the original filamin clone into Y190 yeast cells, selected for growth in the absence of leucine and tryptophan, and assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described above. Truncated forms of filamin and the β1 cytoplasmic tail were generated by PCR using the primer sets shown in Tables I and II. PCR products of the β1cytoplasmic tail truncations were fused in frame to the GAL4bd in the pGBT9 bait vector; PCR products of the filamin truncations were fused in frame to the GAL4ad in the pGAD424 vector. Point mutations of the β1 cytoplasmic tail, fused to the GAL4bd in the pGBT9 vector, were generated using the Quik Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the primer sets shown in Table III.Table IPCR primer sets used to generate filamin truncation constructsFilamin residuesPCR primer set2225–2647CGC GGA TCC GTC CCT TCC AGT TCA CCG TGCAG GTC GAC TCA GGG CAC CAC AAC GCG2323–2647CGC GGA TCC GTG TGC CTG TGG CTT CTC CGT CTCAG GTC GAC TCA GGG CAC CAC AAC GCG2418–2647CGC GGA TCC GTA TCC GAG TTG GGG AGC CTG GCAG GTC GAC TCA GGG CAC CAC AAC GCG2514–2647CGC GGA TCC GTG CCA AAG TCA CAG GCC CCC GTCAG GTC GAC TCA GGG CAC CAC AAC GCG2550–2647CGC GGA TCC GTC CGG GTC CTG GGC CTG CTCAG GTC GAC TCA GGG CAC CAC AAC GCG2171–2550CGC GGA TCC GTC AGG ATA TGA CAG CCC AGG TGCAG GTC GAC TCA CGG GGC CCC ATG CTG GGG GGC ACA GGT GGC2171–2516CGC GGA TCC GTC AGG ATA TGA CAG CCC AGG TGCAG GTC GAC TCA GAC TTT GGC CTT GAA GGG GCT GCC CCC AAT2171–2420CGC GGA TCC GTC AGG ATA TGA CAG CCC AGG TGCAG GTC GAC TCA AAC TCG GAT CTT GAA GGG GCT TCC AGG GAT2171–2325CGC GGA TCC GTC AGG ATA TGA CAG CCC AGG TGCAG GTC GAC TCA CAC AGG CAC CAC GAA GGG GCT GTC GGG AAT2171–2230CGC GGA TCC GTC AGG ATA TGA CAG CCC AGG TGCAG GTC GAC TCA CAC GGT GAA CTG GAA GGG GCT CCC AGG CAC Open table in a new tab Table IIPCR primer sets used to generate CD29 truncation constructsCD29 residuesPCR primer set757–803CCG GAA TTC AAG CTT TTA ATG ATA ATT CAT GACCCG CTG CAG TTG CTA CTT TGC ATT CAG TGT TGT776–803CCG GAA TTC ATG AAT GCC AAA TGG GAC ACG GGT GAACCG CTG CAG TTG CTA CTT TGC ATT CAG TGT TGT757–780CCG GAA TTC AAG CTT TTA ATG ATA ATT CAT GACCCG CTG CAG TCA CCA TTT GGC ATT CAT TTT CTC CTT TTC757–790CCG GAA TTC AAG CTT TTA ATG ATA ATT CAT GACCCG CTG CAG TCA ACT CTT ATA AAT AGG ATT TTC ACC CGT757–796CCG GAA TTC AAG CTT TTA ATG ATA ATT CAT GACCCG CTG CAG TCA GAC CAC AGT TGT TAC GGC ACT CTT ATA757–800CCG GAA TTC AAG CTT TTA ATG ATA ATT CAT GACCCG CTG CAG TCA ATA CTT CGG ATT GAC CAC AGT TGT TAC Open table in a new tab Table IIIPCR primer sets used to generate CD29 point mutant constructsCD29 point mutantPCR primer setD764VGCT TTT AAT GAT AAT TCA TGT CAG AAG GGA GTT TGCGCA AAC TCC CTT CTG ACA TGA ATT ATC ATT AAA AGCN785IGGA CAC GGG TGA AAT TCC TAT TTA TAA GAGCTC TTA TAA ATA GGA ATT TCA CCC GTG TCCN785DGGA CAC GGG TGA AGA TCC TAT TTA TAA GAGCTC TTA TAA ATA GGA TCT TCA CCC GTG TCCP786AGGA CAC GGG TGA AAA TGC TAT TTA TAA GAGCTC TTA TAA ATA GCA TTT TCA CCC GTG TCCY788ECAC GGG TGA AAA TCC TAT TGA GAA GAG TGC CGT AAC AAC TGCAG TTG TTA CGG CAC TCT TCT CAA TAG GAT TTT CAC CCG TGY788ACAC GGG TGA AAA TCC TAT TGC TAA GAG TGC CGT AAC AAC TGCAG TTG TTA CGG CAC TCT TAG CAA TAG GAT TTT CAC CCG TGY788FCAC GGG TGA AAA TCC TAT TTT TAA GAG TGC CGT AAC AAC TGCAG TTG TTA CGG CAC TCT TAA AAA TAG GAT TTT CAC CCGN797ICGT AAC AAC TGT CCT CAT TCC GAA GTA TGA GGGCCC TCA TAC TTC GGA ATG ACC ACA GTT GTT ACGN797DCGT AAC AAC TGT GGT CGA TCC GAA GTA TGA GGGCCC TCA TAC TTC GGA TCG ACC ACA GTT GTT ACGY800ECAA CTG TGG TCA ATC CGA AGG AGG AGG GAA AAT GAG TAC TGCGCA GTA CTC ATT TTC CCT CCT CCT TCG GAT TGA CCA CAG TTGY800ACAA CTG TGG TCA ATC CGA AGG CTG AGG GAA AAT GAG TAC TGCGCA GTA CTC ATT TTC CCT CAG CCT TCG GAT TGA CCA CAG TTGY800FCAA CTG TGG TCA ATC CGA AGT TTG AGG GAA AAT GAG TACGCA GTA CTC ATT TTC CCT CAA ACT TCG GAT TGA CCA CAG TTG Open table in a new tab A DNA fragment encoding the original filamin clone (bases 6686–8119) was generated by PCR using the following primer set: 5′-CGC GGA TCC GTC AGG ATA TGA CAG CCC AGG TG-3′ and 5′-CAG GTC GAC TCA GGG CAC CAC AAC GCG-3′. This fragment was ligated in frame, downstream of DNA sequences encoding the 6-histidine tag, intoBamHI/SalI-digested pQE-32 (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). The 6×His-filamin-QE32 plasmid was transfected into competent M15 (pREP4) Escherichia coli and native 6×His-filamin protein (∼52 kDa molecular mass) was purified by Ni-NTA resin according to the manufacturers instructions (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). 6×His-tagged interleukin-6 (IL-6) and CD40, were similarly generated. 6×His-IL-6 was kindly provided by Dr. P. Wallace and K. Rouleau (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Seattle, WA); 6×His-CD40 was kindly provided by Dr. D. Hollenbaugh and J. Skonier (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Seattle, WA). A peptide containing the cytoplasmic domain of β1(residues 757–803) was synthesized on an Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer model 430A, using butoxycarbonyl amino acids. The peptide resin was cleaved by the low-high HF procedure and the peptide product was dissolved in 50% acetic acid and obtained as a powder following lyophilization from 5% acetic acid. 96-well Immulon II plates (Dynatech Laboratories, Inc., Chantilly, VA) were coated overnight at 4 °C with β1 peptide or bovine serum albumin at 10 μg/ml. The wells were washed twice with PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2/MgCl2 and 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween) then blocked with PBS containing 1× Specimen Diluent (PBS/1× SD; Genetics Systems, Seattle, WA) for 1 h at 20 °C. The wells were washed twice with PBS/Tween and then incubated with the indicated concentrations of 6×His-filamin, 6×His-IL-6, 6×His-CD40, or purified α-actinin (Biodesign International, Kennebunk, ME) diluted in PBS/1× SD for 2 h at 20 °C. Wells incubated with 6×His-tagged proteins were washed five times with PBS/Tween and then incubated with MRGS-His antibody (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) diluted 1:1000 in PBS/1× SD for 1 h at 20 °C. Wells incubated with purified α-actinin were washed five times with PBS/Tween and then incubated with rabbit anti-α-actinin antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:500 in PBS/1× SD for 1 h at 20 °C. The wells were washed five times with PBS/Tween, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG (Tago, Inc., Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:5000 in PBS/1× SD for 1 h at 20 °C, and then washed 10 times with PBS/Tween and treated with the EIA chromogen reagent (Genetics Systems, Seattle, WA) for 15 min at 20 °C. The colorimetric reaction was quenched with 1 nH2SO4, and the optical density was measured on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader at dual wavelengths of 450 and 630 nm. β1-Integrins and filamin were immunoprecipitated from the Jurkat T cell line with mAbs directed against CD29 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and filamin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) respectively, as described previously (34Kanner S.B. Grosmaire L.S. Ledbetter J.A. Damle N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7099-7103Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The isotype matched mAb 2B12 (35Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3328-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) served as a negative control. Jurkat cell lysates were prepared by lysis of ∼2 × 107 cells in 0.5 ml of modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with proteinase inhibitors. Cell lysates were incubated with 5 μg of the indicated mAb for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were recovered by addition of 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with mAbs against CD29 or filamin followed by125I-labeled anti-mouse IgG (36Kanner S.B. Damle N.K. Blake J. Aruffo A. Ledbetter J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2023-2029PubMed Google Scholar). Duplicate blots were similarly probed with antibodies against actin and tropomyosin (Sigma). In an effort to identify cytoplasmic proteins that bind to the cytoplasmic domain of β1, we subcloned a cDNA fragment encoding the complete cytoplasmic domain of β1 into the pGBT9 bait vector. This vector was used in conjunction with a cDNA library generated from activated T cells and prepared in the pGAD10 prey vector to screen for β1 interactive proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system as described previously. A screen of approximately 2 × 106 transformants resulted in the isolation of two cDNA clones that encoded a polypeptide which could specifically bind to the cytoplasmic domain of β1. The recovered prey plasmids were tested in a cotransformation assay with GAL4bd-β1 or control heterologous baits. Both of the clones interacted with the GAL4bd-β1 vector but not the control heterologous baits, as determined using the β-galactosidase activation assay (data not shown). Characterization of these clones revealed that they were identical and encoded the carboxyl-terminal 478 amino acids of the cytoskeletal protein filamin (residues 2171–2647). We also observed that the cytoplasmic domain of the β3-integrin subunit (CD61), which is highly homologous to the cytoplasmic domain of β1, could weakly interact with the isolated filamin clones in the yeast two-hybrid system (data not shown). Electron microscopy studies have shown that filamin is an elongated homodimeric, wishbone-shaped structure (37Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Each monomer consists of an amino-terminal actin binding domain followed by 24 tandem repeats, each ∼96 amino acids in length, which provide for the elongated structure of filamin. The carboxyl-terminal 65 amino acids of the terminal tandem repeat contains a self-assembly sequence that allows for dimerization. This repeat is separated from the previous 23 repeats by an ∼34-amino acid “hinge” domain. The filamin fragment found to be capable of interacting with β1 contained the carboxyl-terminal 4.5 tandem repeats including the hinge domain. We took two approaches to verify the β1-filamin interaction. First, we examined the ability of a recombinant 6×His-filamin chimeric protein, containing the carboxyl-terminal 478 amino acids of filamin, to bind to a 47-amino acid synthetic polypeptide corresponding to the β1cytoplasmic domain. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the interaction between 6×His-filamin and the polypeptide corresponding to the β1 cytoplasmic domain was specific and saturable, and was not blocked by the addition of 0.5% bovine serum albumin (data not shown). Neither 6×His-IL-6 nor 6×His-CD40 control proteins bound to the β1 cytoplasmic domain peptide. Binding of purified α-actinin to the β1 cytoplasmic domain is shown in Fig. 1 B. Similar results were obtained using a recombinant flag-epitope-tagged filamin chimeric protein (data not shown). Second, we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays to test whether β1 interacted with filamin in mammalian cells. Cell lysates from the T cell line Jurkat were incubated with a control mAb or a mAb against β1, and coprecipitating filamin was detected by Western blotting with a mAb against filamin. As shown in Fig. 2, filamin specifically coprecipitated with β1. Neither β1 nor filamin was detected in the control immunoprecipitation. We were unable to detect β1 in anti-filamin mAb immunoprecipitates. This is not unlike the results reported by Sharma et al. (38Sharma C.P. Ezzell R.M. Arnaout M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3461-3470PubMed Google Scholar), who were able to coimmunoprecipitate filamin with an anti-β2 mAb, but were unable to coimmunoprecipitate β2 with anti-filamin mAbs. Neither actin nor the actin-binding protein tropomyosin was detected in anti-β1mAb immunoprecipitates (data not shown). To define the minimal β1 and filamin protein fragments required for the productive interaction of these two proteins, we prepared a series of cDNA constructs containing different fragments of each of these two proteins and examined their ability to interact using the yeast two-hybrid system. A total of 10 filamin constructs were prepared (Fig. 3). Five constructs encoded filamin fragments progressively lacking tandem repeat domains from the amino terminus. The other five encoded filamin fragments progressively lacking tandem repeat domains from the carboxyl terminus. None of the truncated filamin fragments interacted with β1 (Figs. 3and 4). We occasionally observed a weak interaction of β1 with the construct containing the amino-terminal 3.5 tandem repeats (residues 2171–2516) but lacked the hinge and carboxyl-terminal tandem repeat that contains the dimerization domain (data not shown).Figure 4Interaction of β1 cytoplasmic domain with amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal truncated filamin proteins. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y190 was cotransformed with Gal4bd-β1 vector and the indicated Gal4ad-filamin constructs (numbers denote amino acid residues of the filamin primary sequence) and transformants were selected on medium lacking leucine and tryptophan.

We observed that, with one exception, truncations in the cytoplasmic domain of β1prevented the β1-filamin interaction. The only truncation that was tolerated was the removal of the carboxyl-terminal three residues (EGK) of β1 (Figs. 5 and 6).Figure 6Interaction of β1 cytoplasmic domain truncations with filamin. S. cerevisiae strain Y190 was cotransformed with Gal4ad-filamin (amino acid residues 2171–2647) and the indicated Gal4bd-β1 constructs (numbers denote amino acid residues of β1primary sequence), and transformants were selected on medium lacking leucine and tryptophan.

We wished to examine if residues that had been previously shown to be important for β1 function were involved in the β1-filamin interaction. A series of 12 single point mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of β1 were prepared (Fig. 7), and their ability to bind to filamin was examined using the yeast two-hybrid system. Our mutagenesis studies predominantly targeted the two NPXY motifs found in the cytoplasmic domain of β1. The Asn residue in both motifs (Asn-785; Asn-797) was changed to either Ile or Asp, and the Tyr residue in both motifs (Tyr-788; Tyr-800) was changed to Glu, Ala, or"

Despite the clinical importance of this G-protein-coupled receptor and many years of pharmacological research, few intracellular signaling mechanisms triggered by morphine and other μ-opioid agonists have been described. We report that μ-opioid agonists stimulate three different effectors of a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent signaling cascade. By using a cell line stably transfected with the μ-opioid receptor cDNA, we show that the specific agonist [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO) stimulates the activity of Akt, a serine/threonine protein kinase implicated in protecting neurons from apoptosis. Activation of Akt by DAMGO correlates with its phosphorylation at serine 473. The selective PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 blocked phosphorylation of this site, previously shown to be necessary for Akt enzymatic activity. DAMGO also stimulates the phosphorylation of two other downstream effectors of PI3K, the p70 S6 kinase and the repressors of mRNA translation, 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2. Upon μ-opioid receptor stimulation, p70 S6 kinase is activated and phosphorylated at threonine 389 and at threonine 421/serine 424. Phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 is also repressed by PI3K inhibitors as well as by rapamycin, the selective inhibitor of FRAP/mTOR. Consistent with these findings, DAMGO-stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 impairs its ability to bind the translation initiation factor eIF-4E.

Although the behavioral and pharmacological properties of this receptor have been extensively studied, analysis of intracellular signaling has focused almost entirely on inhibition of the cAMP system. Opioid agonists inhibit adenylyl cyclase through coupling of the receptor to a Go/i pertussis-sensitive protein (1Pasternak G.W. The Opiate Receptors.

This activity is mediated by the Gα subunit of the G-protein. Studies on other G-protein-coupled receptors have shown that, upon agonist binding, the GTP-bound Gα subunit dissociates from the Gβγ subunit. The Gβγ subunit then serves as an independent activator of different effector pathways that require a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)1 activity as an early step in the signaling cascade (6Stephens L.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (New England Biolabs) specific for the following proteins were used: Akt phosphorylated at serine 473; control Akt (phosphorylation-independent); p70S6k phosphorylated at threonine 389; p70S6k phosphorylated at both threonine 421 and serine 424; p42 and p44 MAPK (Erk1/2) phosphorylated at threonine 202 and tyrosine 204, as well as a control (phosphorylation-independent) MAPK antibody. Control p70S6k and GSK-3β antibodies were from Santa Cruz and Transduction Laboratories, respectively. Anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibody 12CA5 was from Boehringer Mannheim. We also used immunoaffinity purified antibodies 11209 and 11211 raised against human 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2, respectively, both expressed as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins (Pocono Rabbit Farm, Canadiensis, PA) (18Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y. Belsham G.J. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5578-5583Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Phospho-specific antibodies directed against the various sites on Akt, p70S6k, and GSK-3β were produced as described (19Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A. Comb M.J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16621-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunization of New Zealand White rabbits was carried out with the following synthetic phosphopeptides coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin: Akt (Ser-473), RPHFPQFS*YSASGTC; p70S6k (Thr-389), NQVFLGFT*YVAPKKC; p70S6k (Thr-421/Ser-424), SPRT*PVS*PVKFSC); GSK-3β (crosstide, corresponding to Ser-9 in GSK-3β, and Ser-21 in GSK-3α), RRGRRRTSS*FAEGC. A phosphorylation-independent Akt antibody (control Akt) was raised against the same peptide sequence containing nonphosphorylated Ser-473 (RPHFPQFSYSASGTC); enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using phosphopeptides and corresponding nonphosphopeptides, was used to identify positive rabbits, and IgG was purified using protein A-Sepharose. Further purification steps were performed using adsorption of nonspecific material to nonphosphopeptide affinity column, followed by elution of reactive material from a phosphopeptide affinity column at low pH. Antibodies were then dialyzed and characterized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against phospho- and nonphosphopeptides to determine the extent of phosphospecificity and by Western blotting to examine specificity against whole cell extracts. A Chinese hamster ovary cell line stably transfected with the murine μ-opioid receptor was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and G418 (0.5 mg/ml) (20Kaufman D.L. Keith Jr., D.E. Anton B. Tian J. Magendzo K. Newman D. Tran T.H. Lee D.S. Wen C. Xia Y.-R. Lusis A. Evans C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15877-15883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment cells were grown in 6-well plates for 24 h prior to treatment, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in serum-free medium for 2 h prior to agonist stimulation in the presence or absence of the different inhibitors. This treatment is sufficient for detecting phosphorylation in vivo over background levels, although it does not bring cells to complete quiescence. Incubation with the different inhibitors was initiated either 16 h (pertussis toxin), 1 h (PD98059), 30 min (wortmannin, LY294002, and rapamycin), or 5 min (naloxone) prior to agonist stimulation. HEK293 cells were transfected with DNA constructs expressing the murine μ-opioid receptor and HA-tagged Akt constructs (generous gifts from T. Franke and J. Woodgett) using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent and following the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). For most Western blot experiments, cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells immediately after treatments in Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% w/v bromphenol blue). Extracts were subjected to SDS-10% PAGE and immunoblotted as described (21Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). For analysis of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2, cells were first washed with cold buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 10 nm okadaic acid, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and scraped in the same buffer. Cell lysis was performed by three freeze-thaw cycles. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation and protein concentration in the supernatant determined using the Bio-Rad assay. Cell extracts (75 μg) were incubated at 100 °C for 7 min to enrich for heat-stable 4E-BP1. Samples were incubated on ice for 5 min, and precipitated material was removed by centrifugation. Protein in the supernatant was precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid (20% final concentration), incubation on ice for 1 h, and centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. The protein pellet was rinsed twice with diethyl ether to remove traces of trichloroacetic acid. After allowing the pellet to dry, Laemmli sample buffer was added to the supernatant, and samples were subjected to SDS-15% PAGE (18Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y. Belsham G.J. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5578-5583Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Western blotting, using chemiluminescent detection (New England Biolabs), was performed as described using the antibodies indicated above (21Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 22Gingras A.-C. Kennedy S.G. O'Leary M.A. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1998; 18: 334-342Google Scholar, 23Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). For kinase activity assays, cells were grown in 10-cm plates for 24 h, serum-starved for 2 h, and treated as indicated in the figures. After treatment, cells were scraped into 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors). Extracts were then sonicated and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 × g. Immunoprecipitations were performed by adding the corresponding antibodies and incubating overnight at 4 °C with constant rotation. Protein A-Sepharose beads were then added, and incubation in the same conditions proceeded for 1 more hour. Immunocomplexes were then centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 ×g and washed twice in lysis buffer, twice in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm magnesium chloride), and matched for protein content before being used in each specific kinase reaction. Akt protein was immunoprecipitated with the phosphorylation-independent Akt antibody and used to phosphorylate 1 μg of bacterially expressed and purified GSK3-β protein (New England Biolabs). The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and stopped by adding 2× Laemmli buffer and boiling for 5 min. These samples were then subjected to immunoblotting using GSK3-β (Ser-9) phospho-specific antibody and control antibody to measure phosphorylation of GSK3-β. Same blots were reprobed with phospho-Ser-473 and control Akt antibodies to verify the presence of phosphorylated Akt and that similar amounts of the kinase were present in the reactions. HA-tagged Akt polypeptides were precipitated following the same protocol described above but using the monoclonal antibody 12CA5. For p70S6k activity assays, the kinase was immunoprecipitated with a phosphorylation-independent p70S6k antibody as described above. The resulting immunocomplexes were used to phosphorylate 50 μm of the peptide substrate KRRRLASLAA (24Flotow H. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3074-3078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in a reaction containing kinase buffer (same as above) supplemented with 100 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products), 1 unit/μl cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor (New England Biolabs). Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and stopped by addition of 0.5 mm EDTA. Aliquots of the reactions (5 μl) were spotted on P81 paper, which was then washed 5 times in 75 mm phosphoric acid. Dried papers were placed in 4 ml of scintillation liquid and counted for radioactivity. Separate aliquots of the p70S6k immunocomplexes were immunoblotted using the phospho-Thr-389, phospho-Thr-421/Ser-424, and control p70S6k antibodies as described above. Cell extracts, prepared as described (25Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar), were incubated for 1 h with m7GDP coupled to agarose adipic resin (30 μl of packed beads per reaction). Beads were spun down, washed three times with extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA), and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. The mechanism of Akt regulation involves the interaction between phospholipids produced by PI3K and the amino-terminal pleckstrin homology domain of Akt (26Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar, 27Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). This interaction is critical for translocating Akt to the plasma membrane and for the ability of a newly identified kinase termed phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) to phosphorylate Akt at Thr-308 in its activation loop (28Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Painter G. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. McCormick F. Tempst P. Coadwell J. Hawkins P.T.

Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-473 is also essential for Akt activation (30Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar), although the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of this site has yet to be identified (28Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Painter G. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. McCormick F. Tempst P. Coadwell J. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1998; 279: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Due to the importance of Ser-473 for Akt activation and regulation (30Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar), we have developed an antibody that specifically recognizes Akt only when that residue becomes phosphorylated. We used this antibody to study the activation and phosphorylation of Akt by μ-opioid receptor agonists. To prepare the antibody, rabbits were immunized with a synthetic phosphopeptide containing phosphorylated Ser-473 (RPHFPQFS*YSASGT) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and IgG purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and elsewhere (19Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A. Comb M.J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16621-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Both insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 activate Akt, and this activation results from the phosphorylation of Ser-473 and Thr-308 (28Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Painter G. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. McCormick F. Tempst P. Coadwell J. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1998; 279: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 29Alessi D.R. James S.R.

Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). By using this phosphopeptide antibody, we first examined whether Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 could also be detected after μ-opioid receptor stimulation with the specific agonist DAMGO. Fig. 1 a shows that the specific agonist DAMGO induced a strong immunoreactivity signal, as detected with the phosphopeptide antibody, with a molecular weight corresponding to that of Akt. This signal was inhibited by the opioid receptor-specific antagonist naloxone and by pertussis toxin. Equal levels of immunoreactivity were observed in all samples with a control antibody raised against the same non-phosphorylated peptide sequence. These results suggest that the phosphopeptide antibody recognized phosphorylated Akt and confirmed the loading of equal amounts of protein in the gel. They also indicate that the DAMGO-stimulated increase in Akt phosphorylation is mediated by the Go/Gi-coupled μ-opioid receptor. Identical results were obtained with other μ-receptor-specific agonists (not shown). To test further the specificity of this antibody for Akt phosphorylated at Ser-473, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with a mammalian expression vector encoding the μ-opioid receptor cDNA and either of three HA-tagged Akt constructs expressing wild-type Akt protein, a “kinase dead” version of Akt (with lysine 179 changed to alanine, K179A), or a K179A Akt with Ser-473 mutated to the nonphosphorylatable residue alanine (K179A/S473A). Following a 5-min stimulus with 1 μm DAMGO, cell extracts were prepared, and HA-Akt material was immunoprecipitated using the anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5. Immunoprecipitated complexes were then analyzed by Western blotting using the phospho-Akt (Ser-473), control Akt, and anti-HA antibodies. Fig. 1 a shows that the antibody raised against the phosphopeptide can detect wild-type and K179A but not K179A/S473A Akt protein. The control Akt and HA antibodies detected similar levels of all three versions of Akt proteins present in the precipitated material. This demonstrates that the binding of phosphopeptide antibody to Akt requires serine at position 473. We next verified whether the μ-receptor agonist could induce not only phosphorylation but also Akt enzymatic activity. For this purpose we took advantage of the fact that Akt phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase 3-β (GSK3-β) at Ser-9 in vivo and in vitro (31Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). Cells stably expressing the μ-opioid receptor were stimulated with DAMGO for 5 min in the presence or absence of the antagonist naloxone and then lysed under non-denaturing conditions. Akt polypeptides were immunoprecipitated using the phosphorylation-independent Akt antibody, and the immunocomplexes were incubated together with a bacterially expressed 46-kDa GSK3-β protein in the presence of ATP. To detect phosphorylated GSK3-β, aliquots of the kinase reactions were analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody that recognizes GSK3-β when phosphorylated at Ser-9. As shown in Fig. 1 c, a 46-kDa band corresponding to phosphorylated GSK3-β was detected in kinase reaction samples containing immunoprecipitated Akt from cells stimulated with DAMGO. GSK3-β phosphorylation at Ser-9 was not observed using Akt immunoprecipitated from unstimulated cells or cells treated with the antagonist naloxone. Analysis of the same samples with a phosphorylation-independent GSK3-β antibody showed that equal amounts of GSK-3β protein were present in all reactions and loaded onto the Western gels. The same blots were probed with the phospho- and control Akt antibodies showing that similar amounts of Akt kinase were present in the reactions. We observed a precise correlation between the content of phosphorylated Akt in the immunocomplexes and Akt kinase activity (Fig. 1 c). These results demonstrate that, similar to the effects of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1, DAMGO strongly induced Akt enzymatic activity, and this activation correlates with phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473. Cells expressing the μ-opioid receptor were next incubated for increasing times with the specific agonist DAMGO (100 nm) and cell extracts analyzed by Western blotting using the phospho-Ser-473 Akt antibody. Phosphorylation of Akt was transient, peaking at 5 min after exposure to the agonist, followed by a rapid decline to reach undetectable levels after 1 h of agonist exposure (Fig. 2 a). Akt phosphorylation was detectable after exposure to low concentrations of DAMGO (1–10 nm) increasing in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 b). To test whether μ-receptor stimulation of Akt phosphorylation requires an active PI3K, we exposed the cells to two different chemical inhibitors of PI3K, wortmannin and LY294002. Both drugs completely blocked the activation of Akt at concentrations considered to be specific for PI3K isoforms (8Hawes B.E. Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12133-12136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). At 50 nmwortmannin, phosphorylation of Akt was reduced to approximately 50% and was completely abolished at 200 nm (Fig. 3 a); LY294002 totally blocked the induction of Akt phosphorylation by DAMGO at 5 μm(Fig. 3 b). In addition, DAMGO-induced phosphorylation at Ser-473 was not affected by rapamycin at concentrations as high as 50 nm (Fig. 7, d and e). These results suggest that the μ-opioid induction of Akt phosphorylation is a PI3K-dependent and FRAP/mTOR-independent process.Figure 3DAMGO-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 is blocked by PI3K inhibitors.

Based on its immunolocalization we have named this protein CILP (cartilage intermediate layer protein). Articular cartilage is a heterogeneous tissue where the cells are arranged in layers of matrix that have a different composition and function depending on their location from the articular surface to the subchondral bone (1Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Hereditable Disorders. Wiley-Liss Inc., New York1993: 103-147Google Scholar, 2Bayliss M.T. Venn G. Maroudas A. Ali S.Y. Biochem. J. 1983; 231: 387-400Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The extracellular matrix is also arranged into compartments around the cells: pericellular (closest to the cell), territorial (extending around individual or groups of chondrocytes), and the interterritorial matrix (furthest away from the cells). The matrix is produced by the chondrocytes and contains, as major constituents, fibril-forming collagens and large aggregating proteoglycans that are assembled into highly organized structures (1Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Hereditable Disorders. Wiley-Liss Inc., New York1993: 103-147Google Scholar,3Mendler M. Eich-Bender S.G. Vaugh N. Winterhalter K.H.

Collagen confers tensile properties to the tissue, whereas proteoglycans have a key role in the normal resilience and load dissipation of the cartilage. There is also a minor population of non-collagenous proteins for which no functional role has yet been identified. They may have roles in maintaining the tissue homeostasis by the regulation of matrix assembly, cell recognition, and cell attachment. They may also have a part to play in balancing the processes of cartilage repair and degradation, as well as in disease processes where degradation outbalances repair and loss of tissue ensues. To identify matrix constituents involved in these processes, it is imperative to identify, isolate, and characterize these matrix proteins. The present paper describes the isolation and partial characterization of a 91.5-kDa single chain protein from human articular cartilage. This protein was selected, since it appeared to change in osteoarthritis. The protein was found to be restricted in its tissue distribution to cartilage and furthermore, to specific zones within the tissue. We suggest the name cartilage intermediate layer protein (CILP) 1The abbreviations used are: CILP, cartilage intermediate layer protein; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CM, carboxymethyl; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. in view of its restricted tissue distribution. Human osteoarthritic articular cartilage was obtained at surgery after total hip replacement. The cartilage was dissected clean, sliced into fine pieces, and disrupted using a high speed homogenizer (Polytron, Kinematica GmbH, Kriens-Lusern, Switzerland) in 12 volumes (w/v) of 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, also containing a protease inhibitor mixture (5 mmbenzamidine hydrochloride, 0.1 m 6-aminohexanoic acid) and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The mixture was pre-extracted for 4 h at 4 °C then centrifuged at 20,000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min. The pellet was extracted with 12 volumes (w/v) of 4 m GdnHCl, 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 5.8, containing the protease inhibitor mixture, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 10 mm EDTA, for 24 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g at 4 °C for 30 min. Proteins in the extract were separated from proteoglycans by CsCl density gradient centrifugation with a starting density of 1.5 g/ml under dissociative conditions in 4 m GdnHCl as described elsewhere (6Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 319-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The gradient tube was divided into 4 equal fractions using a Beckman tube slicer, and the top two fractions (D3 and D4) were used for subsequent purification. The pooled fractions from the CsCl gradient (D3 and D4) were concentrated by ultrafiltration (PM-10 membrane, Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA), followed by diaflow against 7 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and then chromatographed on a column of DEAE-cellulose (5 × 10 cm, DE52, Whatman, Maidstone Chemicals, Kent, United Kingdom) equilibrated with the urea buffer. After sample loading, the column was washed with 5 bed volumes of the equilibration buffer, and eluted with a linear gradient (2 × 800 ml) from 0 to 1 m NaCl. Selected fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for the presence of CILP. One pool of the protein was bound to the DEAE column and eluted at 0.04 m NaCl, while the rest of the protein was in the flow-through. This flow-through material was mixed with an equal volume of 20 mm sodium acetate, adjusted to pH 5 and the protein was further purified on a CM-52 column (1.6 × 15 cm, carboxymethyl-cellulose, Whatman Chemicals, Maidstone Kent, United Kingdom), equilibrated in 7 m urea, 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, at 20 ml/h. After loading the sample, the column was washed with 5 bed volumes of equilibration buffer followed by elution with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.5m NaCl. Fractions of 10 ml were collected, monitored for protein content by measuring their absorbance at 280 nm, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing CILP were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration, followed by diaflow against 4 m GdnHCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8, and further chromatographed on two serially coupled FPLC gel filtration columns of Superose 6 and Superdex 200 (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated and eluted at 0.2 ml/min with 4 m GdnHCl, 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.8. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and monitored for protein content by measuring their absorbance at 280 nm. Protein patterns were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Electrophoresis was done as described by Laemmli (7Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) on gradient polyacrylamide (4–16%) slab gels with a 4% polyacrylamide stacking gel. Samples of the fractions were precipitated with 10 volumes of ethanol containing 50 mm sodium acetate and recovered after centrifugation as described elsewhere (8Paulsson M. Sommarin Y. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Precipitates were dissolved in electrophoresis sample buffer (2% SDS, 0.125 mTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.002% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol) without or with 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, boiled at 100 °C for 4 min, and electrophoresed. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). The molecular mass of the purified protein was determined by running linear SDS-PAGE with concentrations ranging from 6 to 12% polyacrylamide. A Ferguson plot was constructed (9Ferguson K.A. Metab. Clin. Exp. 1964; 13: 985-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar) from the relative mobilities of CILP and reference proteins. Molecular mass was determined from the retardation coefficients (K r) as described by Banker and Cotman (10Banker G.A. Cotman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5856-5861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies were raised in rabbits by using CILP purified from the gel filtration separation. The protein (100 μg) was solubilized in 0.15 mNaCl, 5 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4, mixed with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) and injected at multiple sites subcutaneously in the back. Booster doses (100 μg) in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Difco) were given twice, at 1-month intervals. Articular cartilage from different mammalian species: bovine, equine, canine, murine (Swarm rat chondrosarcoma), and human, were extracted with 15 volumes of 4 m GdnHCl containing protease inhibitors, as described above. Aliquots of the extracts corresponding to 2 mg of tissue wet weight, were precipitated twice with 10 volumes of ethanol as described (8Paulsson M. Sommarin Y. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Extracts were electrophoresed on two identical 4–16% gradient SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, with a sample of purified CILP electrophoresed for comparison. One gel was stained for protein with Coomassie Brilliant Blue-R. Proteins were transferred from the other gel to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C, Amersham, United Kingdom) by diffusion (11Bowen B. Steinberg J. Laemmli U.K. Weintraub H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) for immunodetection. The membrane was blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, and incubated with the antibodies to CILP diluted 1:500 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20 containing also 0.1% BSA. Bound antibodies were detected with anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugated (Dakopatts, Copenhagen, Denmark) diluted 1:500 in the same buffer as the primary antibody. Enzyme activity was detected using H2O2 /diaminobenzidine containing cobalt chloride and ammonium nickel sulfate (12De Blas A. Cherwinski M. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The assays were essentially done as described previously (13Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Paulsson M. Antonsson P. Hedbom E. Wendel M. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20428-20433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CILP was coated onto NUNC γ-irradiated polystyrene microtiter plates (Immunoplate I, NUNC, Roskilde, Denmark) at 0.5 μg/ml in 4m GdnHCl, 50 mm sodium carbonate, pH 10, by incubation overnight at room temperature. After rinsing with 0.15m sodium chloride, 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20, the plates were aftercoated with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Serva, Fine Biochemicals, Heidelberg, Germany) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 1 h. Samples of human tissues were extracted with 15 volumes of 4m GdnHCl containing protease inhibitors as described above. The extracts were precipitated twice with ethanol (8Paulsson M. Sommarin Y. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 0.8% SDS in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, to give stock solutions corresponding to 4 mg of the original tissue wet weight per ml. Dilutions were made from these stock solutions and added to an equal volume of antiserum in 4% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.01m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. After preincubation for 1 h at room temperature this mixture was added to the coated wells of the microtiter plates. After 1 h plates were rinsed and bound antibodies were detected using a swine anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Orion Diagnostica, Helsinki, Finland) withp-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) as the substrate. A standard curve using purified CILP in 0.8% (w/v) SDS, 10 mm phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, was included in each microtiter plate. All samples were analyzed in triplicate and the mean value was used for calculations. Normal appearing human articular cartilage from a 38-year-old hip joint was obtained from autopsy. Full-depth plugs of cartilage, 4 mm in diameter, were excised using a cork borer. The cartilage was frozen, embedded in O.C.T. compound (Tissue Teck II, Miles Laboratories, Naperville, IL) and sectioned at −25 °C in a cryostat. Cryosections (5 μm) were transferred onto gelatin-coated glass slides, dried at room temperature for 2 h, fixed at 4 °C with cold acetone for 10 min, and rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). To increase antibody permeability, the sections were digested for 30 min at room temperature with 2 mg/ml hyaluronidase (from bovine testes, type I, Sigma) in PBS, pH 5. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched by incubating in PBS containing 1% (v/v) H2O2for 20 min at room temperature. After rinsing three times with PBS, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, each section was incubated with goat serum diluted 1:70 in PBS, 0.1%(w/v) BSA for 20 min to reduce nonspecific binding. Sections were then incubated with the primary antibody against CILP (diluted 1:800 with PBS, 0.1% BSA) or with preimmune rabbit serum (diluted 1:400 with PBS, 0.01% BSA) at 4 °C overnight in a moist chamber. After rinsing three times with PBS, 0.01% BSA, the sections were treated with biotinylated second antibody (diluted 1:200) and avidin peroxidase conjugate using the vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Normal appearing human articular cartilage was obtained from a 38-year femoral head at post-morten. Full-depth plugs of cartilage, 4 mm in diameter, were excised using a cork borer and sectioned in a cryostat at −25 °C. Slices 20 μm thick were cut parallel to the cartilage surface, and each 10 consecutive sections were pooled to represent 200 μm. This procedure provided 9 pools from the articular surface to the subchondral bone. The slices were extracted with 200 μl of 4 m GdnHCl, 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 5.8, containing the protease inhibitor mixture and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide as described. The extracts were precipitated twice with ethanol (8Paulsson M. Sommarin Y. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and the CILP content in each pool was determined by ELISA as described. Human articular cartilage (femoral head) was obtained at surgery for hip replacement, dissected under sterile conditions, and placed (25 mg of tissue/ml medium) in Ham's F-12 culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY), pH 7.4, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 25 μg/ml ascorbate. The explants were metabolically labeled with 50 μCi/ml [3H]leucine and 25 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate (Amersham International, Bucks, UK) for 4 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2, 95% air. After labeling the explants were washed with medium without isotopes, wiped dry and extracted with 4 m GdnHCl, as described above. An aliquot of the extract was precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in 60 μl of 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.8% (w/v) SDS. To bind excess SDS the sample was then mixed with 60 μl of 2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in the same buffer. Rabbit immune serum (30 μl) was immediately added and the sample was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Immunoglobulins and bound antigen were then adsorbed onto protein-A Sepharose (30 μl) (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) by incubation for 4 h at 4 °C. Bound material was recovered by centrifugation, washed, resuspended in electrophoresis buffer, and electrophoresed as above. Radiolabeled proteins were detected by fluorography. The polyacrylamide gels were washed in distilled water for 30 min, soaked in 5 volumes of 1.3 m sodium salicylate for 35 min, dried on a gel drier (LKB Bromma, Sweden) and, exposed to a preflashed Kodak XAR-5 film for 3–4 weeks at −80 °C. Samples to be digested were precipitated with ethanol. For theN-glycosidase F digestion the samples were resuspended in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 0.1% SDS, and incubated in a boiling water bath for 3 min. Then an equal volume of 0.125m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, was added, plus 5 μl of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg of trypsin inhibitor (from chicken egg white type II-0, Sigma), and 1 unit of enzyme (PNGase F, Boehringer Mannheim, GMBL, Germany). Samples to be digested with O-glycosidase were resuspended in 15 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0. Trypsin inhibitor (1 μg) was added to the reaction mixture and 0.5 milliunits of enzyme (Boehringer Mannheim). Deglycosylation was overnight in a water bath at 37 °C. An aliquot of the mixtures before and after digestion was diluted with sample buffer (2% SDS, 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.002% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol), boiled at 100 °C for 4 min, and electrophoresed on a linear 8% acrylamide gel. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). A 91.5-kDa monomeric protein was isolated from GdnHCl extracts of human articular cartilage. The initial step included a dissociative CsCl gradient centrifugation in order to separate the matrix proteins from the bulk of proteoglycans. The lower density fractions of the gradient (D3 plus D4) were combined and used as the source of CILP. This fraction was chromatographed on DEAE cellulose at pH 6, where a pool of CILP appeared in the flow-through. This pool was applied on a CM-52 column equilibrated at pH 5 and eluted with a gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. Analysis of selected fractions by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions showed that CILP eluted at 0.22 m NaCl in a small peak together with a large number of lower molecular weight components (Fig. 1). The fractions (38–44) containing CILP were combined and brought into 4 m GdnHCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8, by diaflow and was then further purified on serially coupled FPLC gel filtration columns of Superose 6/Superdex 200 FPLC. CILP eluted in a small peak over four fractions (47–50, Fig. 2), two of which were free of other proteins as judged by the SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, inset). By this procedure a yield of 129 μg of CILP per gram of tissue wet weight was obtained. This yield from osteoarthritic cartilage, however, represents an underestimation of the total, since the losses in the procedure including the CILP bound to the DEAE column are not accounted for.Figure 2Gel filtration chromatography. The pooled fractions from the CM-cellulose column were concentrated by ultrafiltration, followed by diaflow against 4 m GuHCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8, and chromatographed on two tandemly arranged FPLC columns of Superose 6 and Superdex 200. Absorbance was monitored at 280 nm. The peak containing CILP is indicated by a bar (fractions 47–50). Aliquots of each fraction (46–70) were precipitated with ethanol and electrophoresed on a 4 to 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel without previous reduction (inset). The gel was stained for proteins with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R. The migration positions of the molecular mass markers are indicated on the left and that of CILP by a curved arrow (47–50).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The relative mobility of CILP on SDS-PAGE was not significantly affected by reduction, which suggested a monomeric protein (data not shown). The molecular mass of CILP was estimated after electrophoresis of the protein on 6, 8, 10, and 12% SDS-PAGE (6Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 319-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 7Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). The Cotman plot suggested an ideal behavior and the molecular mass determined was 91,500 Da (data not shown). Early attempts to purify CILP from human articular cartilage involved direct extraction of the cartilage with the GdnHCl solution. However, the abundant albumin in the preparation masked a pool of CILP that was bound to the DEAE column. This pool eluted at a very low salt concentration (0.04 m NaCl), while the remainder of CILP appeared in the flow-through as discussed above. Preliminary studies were done using protein in this pool purified by CM-52 chromatography and gel filtration. In a subsequent study investigating the component which bound to DEAE, the tissue was pre-extracted with phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4, containing the protease inhibitor mixture, to remove the albumin and other proteins not tightly held in the cartilage matrix. The two pools of CILP, i.e. the one bound to the DEAE and the one in the flow-through, showed identical peptide patterns after trypsin digestion when analyzed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (C18) (data not shown). The two protein variants also appeared to have a similar content of N-linked oligosaccharides since their respective mobilities upon SDS-PAGE before and after N-glycanase digestion were identical (data not shown). No further experiments were done to elucidate the difference between the two proteins. All the biochemical studies were done using the protein pool from the CM-cellulose chromatography (Fig. 2). Antibodies against CILP were raised in rabbits by using the purest fractions from the gel filtration chromatography. To determine the specificity of the antibodies, an aliquot of the guanidine hydrochloride extracts from different species (human, bovine, murine, canine, and equine) were precipitated with ethanol, electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. An immunoreactive band corresponding to the relative mobility of CILP was detected in the extracts (Fig. 3). No positive staining was, however, observed in the extract of the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma. There were differences in the relative intensities of the band in the various tissues, although the protein staining indicate similar load of the extracts onto the different lanes. This may result from limited cross-reactivity or indicate a variable abundance of the protein. GdnHCl extracts were prepared from various tissues, and the presence of CILP was determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay developed (Fig. 4). All the cartilage extracts analyzed gave inhibition curves parallel to the standard showing that the assay actually measured the same protein with no interfering substances. The concentration of CILP was calculated to be 129 ng/mg tissue wet weight for normal articular cartilage (from a finger joint), 62 ng/mg for tracheal cartilage, and 983 ng/mg for rib cartilage. It was apparent that the non-cartilaginous tissues analyzed (liver, kidney, intestine, lung, skin, aorta, muscle, tendon, and bone) did not contain detectable amounts of the protein. Analysis of the CILP content in articular cartilages from individuals of different ages showed considerably lower values in the younger individuals (Fig. 5). After cessation of growth, the levels of the protein were quite variable, but in general they were higher than in the younger individuals. The distribution of CILP in human articular cartilage was studied by immunohistochemistry applying the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method using cryosections. The protein was detected primarily in the middle zone, while it was less prominent or absent at the superficial and the very deepest zones of the articular cartilage (Fig. 6). The antibodies primarily stained the interterritorial matrix of the tissue, while low or no reactivity was seen in the pericellular matrix of the chondrocytes. Based on its immunolocalization we have named this protein CILP (cartilage intermediate layer protein). To further characterize the CILP localization within the articular cartilage, sections parallel to the cartilage surface were made. Nine layers of 250 μm from the articular surface to the subchondral bone were obtained, and the CILP content was determined by ELISA as shown in Fig. 7. Even though there were detectable amounts of CILP through the cartilage depth, the content was higher in the middle layers. To determine whether the protein is a true cartilage constituent synthesized by the chondrocytes, human hip articular cartilage explants were metabolically labeled with [3H]leucine and [35S]sulfate. After extraction the protein was immunoprecipitated. As it is shown in Fig. 8, a major band with a relative mobility corresponding to CILP was identified by fluorography after SDS-PAGE under reduced and nonreduced conditions. However, after reduction two higher molecular weight components were also immunoprecipitated. They may represent either aggregates or possibly cross-reactivity with some related proteins or nonspecific reactivity that is sometimes observed at this position with other rabbit antisera (data not shown). CILP containsN-linked oligosaccharides as shown by a significant change in its relative mobility after N-glycosidase F digestion (Fig. 9). The change in mobility gives as an estimate the oligosaccharide content to represent as much as 10% of the molecular mass of the protein. No apparent change in its mobility was observed after O-glycosidase digestion (data no shown). The functional demands on different parts of articular cartilage are not fully understood. It is, however, known that different parts of the tissue have a different composition and structure. Thus, in the superficial region of the tissue, the collagen fibers are thinner and the relative abundance of aggrecan is much lower. In contrast, contents of decorin and COMP are higher than in the remainder of the tissue. Cells in the deeper layer elaborate thicker collagen fibers that are arranged in a different direction to those in the surface layers and the deep zone also has a higher aggrecan content. However, there have been no previous descriptions of a protein, like CILP, that can be used to define an intermediate layer of the tissue. It is an enigma why a specific protein is required to satisfy the functional demands of the tissue in this layer, and the characteristics of the protein offers no explanation. It is clear that CILP is synthesized and deposited in the extracellular matrix by the chondrocytes. Its absence from other tissues is also of interest and is further evidence suggesting that the protein has a specific function in cartilage. The restricted distribution of the protein to the interterritorial compartment also indicates that it has a possible role in maintaining the structure of the tissue rather than in the regulation of cellular activities. It is of interest to note that CILP is one of four proteins whose expression is enhanced in the early stages of human osteoarthritis. 2P. Lorenzo, M. T. Bayliss, and D. Heinegård, unpublished data. This may indicate a specific role for the protein in tissue repair. The high concentration of the protein in rib cartilage is intriguing. Why this particular cartilage is highly enriched in CILP will be the objective of future studies. Similarly, the relatively low levels in tracheal cartilage should also provide clues to the function of CILP. These preliminary findings may be taken to indicate that compressive load is a factor controlling the tissue content of the protein. Future work will investigate the role of the protein in tissue biology. CILP has an apparent molecular mass similar to that of, e.g.92-kDa gelatinase. In contrast to CILP this proteinase is, however, not restricted to cartilage and to the interterritorial matrix. Further support for CILP as a novel protein was obtained by cDNA cloning and deduced amino acid sequence (14Lorenzo, P., Neame, P., Sommarin, Y., and Heinegård, D. (1998)273, 23469–23475Google Scholar). CILP containsN-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides, whereas there was no indication of O-glycosidically linked sugars. An estimated alteration in mass of 10% of the total upon removal of these oligosaccharides, indicates that 3–5 such structures are present. CILP levels in articular cartilage increases with age. Similarly, there is considerable evidence to support the accumulation of matrix aggrecan during normal aging of articular cartilage. The increasing concentration of CILP with age may, like in the case of aggrecan, reflect a slow turnover of the protein, particularly in the interterritorial matrix.

The presence of χ and ψ makes the holoenzyme resistant to glutamate concentrations up to 800 mm and dramatically increases the affinity of DnaX for δ and δ′, dropping theK D to a point where they saturate DnaX at physiological concentrations (17Olson M.W. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29570-29577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition to the holoenzyme, the polymerase can be resolved into three distinct subassemblies of decreasing complexity: pol III*, pol III′, and pol III. The activity of pol III core is limited in processivity and is inhibited by both SSB and physiological levels of spermidine (18Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 976-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Association of τ forms the dimeric pol III′ that is slightly more processive and resistant to spermidine inhibition but still sensitive to inhibition by SSB (18Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S.

Pol III* (pol III′ + γ2δ1δ′1χ1ψ1) becomes resistant to SSB inhibition and exhibits an increased processivity. DNA polymerases that are stimulated by their cognate SSBs also bind to them. T4 gp32 and T7 gene 2.5 protein SSBs stimulate and bind to T4 and T7 DNA polymerase, respectively (22Hurley J.M. Chervitz S.A. Jarvis T.C. Singer B.S. Gold L. J. Mol.

Human RP-A protein has been shown to interact directly with DNA polymerase α (27Dornreiter I. Erdile L.F. Gilbert I.U. von Winkler D. Kelly T.J. Fanning E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In E. coli, SSB stimulates and binds to DNA polymerase II, but not DNA polymerase III (28Molineux I.J. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3858-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since pol III* is stimulated by SSB and pol III′ is inhibited, γ, δ, δ', χ, or ψ would be expected to interact with SSB. Consistent with this hypothesis, Fradkin and Kornberg (29Fradkin L.G. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10318-10322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have observed γ complex binding to DNA that is SSB-dependent. In this report, we demonstrate that χψ binds to SSB in the presence or absence of other subunits of the DnaX complex and that the interaction of SSB with χψ is responsible for the previously observed salt resistance conferred upon the holoenzyme by χψ. We also demonstrate an additional function of χψ in forming a minimal polymerase (pol III′ + χψ) capable of replicating SSB-coated DNA. Pol III holoenzyme protein subunits were purified as follows: core (30McHenry C.S. Crow W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1748-1753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), β (31Johanson K.O.

The E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein was purified according to Griep and McHenry (20Griep M.A. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11294-11301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin used in enzyme dilution buffer for replication assays was purchased from Intergen. Nonlabeled nucleotides and tritiated dTTP were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and the32P-nucleotides were purchased from ICN. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Synthetic Genetics Inc. The sequence of the 52-mer was 5′-TTGGACAGATGAACGGTGTACAGACCAGGCGCATAGGCTGGCTGACCTTCAT-3′. The 102-mer's sequence was 5′-TTACGTTGATTTGGGTAATGAATATCCGGTTCTTGTCAAGATTACTCTTGATGAAGGTCAGCCAGCCTATGCGCCTGGTCTGTACACCGTTCATCTGTCCAA-3′. The F52-mer has the same sequence as the 52-mer above but has a fluorescein attached to the 5′-OH. 3The fluorescein has no functional purpose in this experiment; it was attached to support another investigation. The 102-mer has a biotin molecule attached to the 5′-end. The 3′-ends of the F52-mer and 102-mer were modified to impart ε-exonuclease resistance to the oligonucleotides. In each, the third base from the 3′-end is a ribonucleotide connected to the penultimate base through a phosphorothioate linkage. These modifications increase the half-life of the oligonucleotide from 2 s to 18 min (33Griep M.A. Reems J. Franden M.A. McHenry C.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9006-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). M13Gori single-stranded DNA was prepared according to Johanson et al. (31Johanson K.O. Haynes T.E. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11460-11465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce Coomassie Plus assay according to the manufacturer's specifications. Bovine serum albumin (fat-free, Sigma) was used as an assay standard. Superose 12 column fractions were loaded (20 μl) onto a 5–17.5% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel (0.75 × 18 × 16 cm) prepared according to Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and separated at 65 V overnight. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 in 20% methanol and 10% acetic acid with destaining being done in 10% methanol and 10% acetic acid. Molecular interactions were studied using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech BIAcore™ instrument. CM5 research grade sensor chips (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used in all experiments. Activation of the carboxylmethyl dextran matrix was done using a 30-μl injection of a mixture of 0.2m 1-ethyl-3-[(3-dimethylamino)propyl]-carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide in water. Following the immobilization of the ligand, the matrix was inactivated by a 30-μl injection of 1 m ethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.0). Streptavidin and bovine IgG were sequentially immobilized in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5) at 0.2 mg/ml and 0.1 mg/ml, respectively. SSB was immobilized in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0) at 0.05 mg/ml. An HBS buffer system (10 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% P-20 detergent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)) was used in the immobilization of the biotinylated primer-template to the streptavidin-derivatized chip. Protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions were then carried out in HKGM buffer (50 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.005% P-20 detergent) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min at 20 °C. Ranges for apparentK D values were determined using BIAevaluation 2.1 software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Injections of analyte over a streptavidin-derivatized flow cell were subtracted from the data as background. Three k on and threek off values for the resultant sensogram were determined and used in the calculation of the range for theK D. 5′-End-labeling of the 52-mer primer was done with [α-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 250 mm imidazole (pH 6.4), 60 mm MgCl2, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.35 mm ADP (5× concentrate) at 37 °C. All primer and templates were annealed in 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl in a 1:1 ratio of primer to template. Annealing was done in an MJ Research Minicycler heating the mixture to 75 °C for 5 min and cooling to 25 °C at 0.5 °C/min. Replication of the 52-mer/M13Gori primer-template was done under the following conditions. 25-μl assays contained 480 pmol of singly primed (with the 52-mer) M13 DNA (total nucleotide); 500 fmol of τ4; 600 fmol of pol III core (αεθ); 600 fmol of δ; 600 fmol of δ′; 500 fmol of χψ; 500 fmol of β2; 900 nm SSB4; 48 μm dATP, dCTP, and dGTP; 18 μm[3H]TTP (specific activity = 520 cpm/pmol TTP). Reactions were carried out in enzyme dilution buffer (50 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mpotassium glutamate (unless otherwise indicated), 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20) and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. Assays were quenched by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. 52/102-mer primer-template assays contained 12 pmol of pol III core (αεθ), 3.2 pmol of τ or γ complex, 16 pmol of β, and 8 pmol of SSB monomer. Typically, 1 pmol of primer-template was used in a 25-μl assay containing enzyme dilution buffer (50 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 m potassium glutamate, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmmagnesium acetate, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20) and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. Each assay involving elongation of 32P-labeled primer contained 18 μm TTP and 48 μm dATP, dCTP, and dGTP.32P incorporation assays contained 18 μm[32P]TTP (specific activity = 800 cpm/pmol) and 48 μm dATP, dCTP, and dGTP. Reaction products were analyzed on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Quantitation of gel results were done using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). Previously, we demonstrated that χψ confers salt resistance to a τ-reconstituted DNA polymerase III holoenzyme but not a γ-reconstituted holoenzyme (17Olson M.W. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29570-29577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The experiments in that report were all performed in the presence of SSB. We sought to ascertain whether SSB played a role in the observed salt effects. We bypassed the need for a DnaG primase and the accompanying SSB requirement by annealing a DNA 52-mer primer to an M13 template. Using this 52-mer/M13 primer-template, we reproduced the χψ-dependent salt resistance of a τ-reconstituted holoenzyme. In the presence of χψ, the reconstituted holoenzyme retains >75% of its activity in the presence of 800 mm potassium glutamate. DNA replication of the reconstituted holoenzyme in the absence of χψ is inhibited by high salt (Fig. 1 A). In order to determine whether the presence of SSB influenced salt resistance, we performed the same experiment in the absence of SSB (Fig. 1 B). In the absence of SSB and added salt, the reconstituted holoenzyme was still able to replicate 41–43% of the template whether χψ was present or not. As the salt concentration was increased, the activities of both the χψ-proficient and χψ-less τ-reconstituted enzymes were inhibited equally (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the salt resistance previously observed (17Olson M.W. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29570-29577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) required both χψ and SSB. This result prompted us to examine whether SSB physically interacts with χψ. Incubation of equimolar amounts of χψ and SSB4 resulted in a complex of the components as revealed by Superose 12 gel filtration. The SSB-χψ complex (Fig. 2 C) elutes earlier than either of the individual proteins alone (Fig. 2, A and B), demonstrating that χψ and SSB interact directly. The concentration of the χψ and SSB4 applied to the gel filtration column was 8.3 μm with the eluant being diluted 6-fold, suggesting that the χψ-SSB K D is probably in the micromolar range. SSB interacts with the γ-complex only when χψ is present. Complexes containing only γ, δ, and δ′ do not bind SSB (Fig. 2 D). Minimally, γ and χψ are required for γ to enter into a complex with SSB (Fig. 2 E). The addition of δ and δ′ to γχψ increases the affinity of γ for χψ (17Olson M.W. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29570-29577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) resulting in more χψ in the high molecular weight complex and an accompanying larger amount of SSB (Fig. 2 F). SSB also binds to the τ-complex in a χψ-dependent manner (data not shown). Having demonstrated that χψ and SSB interact directly by gel filtration, we determined the K D for their interaction using the BIAcore™. Our initial investigation into the interaction between χψ and SSB on the BIAcore found that the on and off rates for the interaction were too fast to be amenable to a kinetic analysis. Therefore, we utilized an equilibrium approach on the BIAcore to determine the dissociation constant. Various concentrations of χψ were passed over SSB covalently attached to a CM5 sensor chip. Identical injections were made over a bovine serum albumin-derivatized chip, and the resulting sensograms were subtracted from the data as background. Fig. 3 A shows an overlay plot of sensograms representing χψ injections of varying concentrations. The R max from each sensogram was plotted as a function of the χψ concentration (Fig. 3 B). A hyperbolic relationship is observed, indicating that saturation was nearly achieved at concentrations equaling or exceeding 10 μm χψ. The data were fit to a rectangular hyperbola (RUbound = [χψ] (RUmax)/([χψ] +K D)) generating a K D of 2.7 μm for the interaction. Three oligonucleotides were synthesized for use in experiments in solution and on the BIAcore™. The F52-mer was annealed to the 5′-biotinylated 102-mer with the 5′-fluoresceinated end of the F52-mer being flush with the 3′-end of the 102-mer. This construct was immobilized on a streptavidin-derivatized BIAcore™ sensor chip for binding studies (Fig. 4, A and B). The primer-template construct showed no dissociation or loss in RUs over the time course of the experiments. SSB was then passed over the DNA, binding with a stoichiometry of 1:1.1 DNA to SSB4(Fig. 4 C). Under these ionic conditions, one SSB tetramer would be expected to bind to the exposed 50 nucleotides of single-stranded DNA (35Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). We next wanted to ascertain the role of the χψ-SSB interaction during the association of the DnaX complex with SSB-coated primer-template. Either 400 nm τ-complex (τδδ′χψ) or τδδ′ complex was passed over primer-template in the presence or absence of SSB prebound to the DNA (Fig. 5, A–D). The τ-complex does not significantly interact with the primer-template in the absence of SSB (stoichiometry < 1:0.04) (Fig. 4 A). In the presence of SSB and absence of χψ, the clamp loader complex does not interact stably with primer-template (stoichiometry < 1:0.04) (Fig. 5 D). It is only when both SSB and χψ are present that the τ-complex interacts with the F52/102-mer (stoichiometry 1:1.9 DNA to τ-complex) (Fig. 5 B). In a parallel experiment using a range of protein concentrations, we determined the apparent KD of the τ- and γ-complex for SSB-coated DNA to be 3 and 9 nm, respectively. This range is approximately 1000-fold lower than the value determined for χψ and SSB alone, suggesting that the presence of the DNA and auxiliary subunits significantly strengthens the interaction. The binding and subsequent stable complex formed when the τ-complex interacts with the SSB-coated primer-template prompted us to test whether the γ-complex functions in a similar manner. Four experiments performed using the γ-complex (Fig. 6) in place of the τ-complex demonstrated that significant binding only occurred in the presence of both χψ and SSB (stoichiometry 1:1 DNA to γ-complex).Figure 6χψ mediates a strong interaction of the γ-complex with an SSB-coated primer-template. The experiments shown in Fig. 4 were repeated identically for γδδ′χψ and γδδ′ on the F52/102-mer3 primer-template in the presence and absence of SSB. A, 400 nmγδδ′χψ over a primer-template with no SSB. B, the same conditions as in A but with an SSB-coated primer-template. C, 400 nm γδδ′ over the primer-template in the absence of SSB. D, the same conditions as in C but with an SSB-coated primer-template. Proteins were diluted in HKGM plus 100 μm ATP. Injection volumes were 35 μl at a flow rate of 5 μl/min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to assign a functional significance to the χψ-SSB interaction, we investigated its role in DNA replication on short defined primer-templates. Fig. 7demonstrates that various holoenzyme subassemblies can elongate the F52/102-mer primer-template. Bands represent incorporation of [α-32P]TTP arising from DNA synthesis. In the absence of auxiliary subunits, pol III can elongate a small percentage of the primer to full length (Fig. 7, lane 1). This elongation is prevented when SSB coats the primer-template (lane 2). The SSB-coated F52/102-mer can be elongated significantly by τ and pol III only when χψ is present (compare lanes 3 and 4). The addition of β in the presence of the τ-clamp assembly complex facilitates elongation in the presence and absence (compare lanes 5 and 6) of SSB on the DNA. In the presence of β and absence of the τ-complex, no elongation is observed in the presence of SSB (lane 7). The experiments presented in Fig. 7 prompted us to determine the minimum requirements necessary in order to overcome the SSB inhibition of pol III. We end-labeled the 52-mer with 32P and incorporated unlabeled dNTPs with various combinations of holoenzyme subunits (Fig. 8). The trend seen in the experiment reported in Fig. 7 was also observed here; pol III is inhibited by SSB on the primer-template (Fig. 8, comparelanes 1 and 2). τ and χψ by themselves (lanes 3 and 4) produce replication products identical to those generated by the inhibited pol III core and do not support full-length product formation. The addition of δδ′ to τ produces replication products identical to τ alone (lane 6). The concerted action of both τ and χψ allows full-length primer extension (lane 5). Additionally, we sought to determine if τ's ability to interact with the core polymerase played a role in the elongation process. In comparing the ability of the τ- and γ-complex to facilitate the primer elongation we found that the γ-subunit is unable to facilitate primer extension in the presence of χψ (compare lanes 7 and 8). The presence of τ rescues γ in the presence of χψ and permits pol III to replicate through SSB to full-length product (lane 9). Quantitation of the full-length product arising from each subassembly reaction was done by integrating each lane and examining the resultant percentages (Table I). In the presence of pol III and SSB, 100% full-length product formation occurs when, minimally, both τ and χψ are present.Table IThe τ-χψ interaction relieves SSB inhibition of pol IIISubassembly1-aFrom the gel in Fig. 8.Percentage of full-length product1-bPercentage of elongation was determined by dividing the percentage of fully elongated product from each subassembly by the percentage of fully elongated product from pol III alone.%Pol III100Pol III SSB10Pol III SSB τ9.3Pol III SSB χψ5.3Pol III SSB τ χψ100Pol III SSB τ δδ′31Pol III SSB τ δδ′ χψ110Pol III SSB γ δδ′ χψ29Pol III SSB τ γ δδ′ χψ1161-a From the gel in Fig. 8.1-b Percentage of elongation was determined by dividing the percentage of fully elongated product from each subassembly by the percentage of fully elongated product from pol III alone. Open table in a new tab The interaction of a single-stranded DNA-binding protein with its cognate polymerase has been well documented (22Hurley J.M. Chervitz S.A. Jarvis T.C. Singer B.S. Gold L. J.

The benefits arising from this interaction are obvious, since any interaction promoting the co-localization of an enzyme and its substrate is probably a favorable one. The observations that pol III* and not pol III′ is stimulated by SSB (18Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 976-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that γ-complex binds to single-stranded DNA coated with SSB, but not to uncoated single-stranded DNA (29Fradkin L.G. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10318-10322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that a component of the γ-complex (γ, δ, δ′, δ, χ, ψ) binds to E. coli SSB. We directly demonstrate, by gel filtration and surface plasmon resonance, that χψ and no other holoenzyme component forms a tight complex with SSB. Thus, the SSB stimulation of higher forms of DNA polymerase III probably arises from this interaction. The DnaX gene products form a complex with χψ (17Olson M.W. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29570-29577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 38Xiao H. Dong Z. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11779-11784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SSB binds to and gel filters with χψ whether it exists alone or in a protein complex. Thus, χψ can bind to SSB in the presence of its partners in the DnaX complex and holoenzyme. This shows that binding of SSB and DnaX are not mutually exclusive, consistent with an SSB-χψ interaction during holoenzyme initiation complex assembly and elongation. The interaction between the DnaX complex subunits χψ and SSB prompted us to investigate whether this interaction could strengthen the interaction between the complex and the DNA. The χψ-SSB interaction brings together entities that must interact for both clamp loading and replication to occur. Considering the relatively high equilibrium constant for the proteins in the absence of DNA, χψ and SSB probably do not interact significantly free in the cell. It is only when SSB is bound to the DNA primer-template and the clamp loader associates with the primer terminus that the χψ-SSB interaction occurs. The apparent K D for the χψ-SSB interaction is significantly (approximately 1000-fold) lower under conditions where a DNA template and auxiliary subunits are present. The relatively low affinity of free SSB for χψ probably prevents SSB from acting as a competititve inhibitor of χψ-SSB-DNA binding, enabling holoenzyme to be targeted to the replication fork. We have demonstrated that the DnaX complex binds to SSB via χψ on an SSB-coated primer-template. The τ-complex binds to the SSB/DNA with nearly twice the stoichiometry of the γ-complex, suggesting perhaps that the C-terminal portion of τ provides some added stability over γ, enabling interactions away from the primer terminus. Further experiments will be necessary in order to resolve the reason for the higher stoichiometry. The ability of the χψ-SSB interaction to link a polymerase subassembly and a DNA template led us to investigate its functional role in replication. The χψ-SSB interaction enables pol III* and not pol III or pol III′ to replicate through an SSB-coated DNA template. The minimal assembly that can replicate on an SSB template is pol III-τ-ψχ. γ, which can interact with χψ, but not pol III, is unable to replace τ in the assembly, consistent with χψ needing to be held in the proximity of the polymerase to stimulate it during the replicative reaction. This provides further evidence for our observations that the DnaX complex does not cycle during replication and is a required component for elongation. In a previous study, we found that χψ relieved the salt inhibition of a τ-reconstituted holoenzyme and not a γ-reconstituted one that lacked τ (17Olson M.W. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29570-29577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here, we reproduced this effect and added the finding that salt resistance occurs only when χψ and SSB are both present. The most direct explanation that is consistent with all of our observations is that χψ interacts with SSB during replication, stabilizing the complex, and that at elevated salt, when electrostatic interactions are diminished, this interaction becomes dominant in stabilizing polymerase-template-primer interactions. It would follow that a significant portion of the χψ-SSB binding energy derives from hydrophobic interactions. In a review article, O'Donnell and colleagues (38Xiao H. Dong Z. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11779-11784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) refer to an unpublished observation that χ and SSB interact. This finding would extend our own to identifying the χ component of the χψ pair as the interacting subunit. Our results show that χψ is important for stabilizing and interaction with a primer-template in the presence of SSB, especially at elevated salt, but show that the interaction is not required for efficient replication, at least on single-stranded templates. If β is loaded by a DnaX complex lacking χψ, efficient elongation can still be achieved on an SSB-coated template. This would suggest that a signal that triggers SSB to release during replication resides in a component other than χψ, perhaps the polymerase itself. Since there is only one copy of χψ/dimeric DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, χψ probably functions in the lagging strand half, stabilizing interactions with the SSB-coated template during elongation and in establishing new initiation complexes on nascent primers. After this manuscript was prepared for publication, a report appeared (Kelman, Z., Yuzhakov, A., Andjelkovic, J., and O'Donnell, M. (1998) EMBO J. 17, 2436–2449) that overlapped with a subset of our findings. Based on the behavior of reactions reconstituted with a mutant SSB, it was inferred that an SSB-χ interaction was responsible for the observed salt resistance of elongation complexes. This report also localized the site of interaction to the carboxyl terminus of SSB."

Recent reports have shown that nitric oxide synthase inhibitors block proliferation and microvascular hyperpermeability induced by VEGF. This study examined the mechanisms by which nitric oxide and its downstream signals mediate the VEGF-induced proliferative response in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Nitric oxide synthase blockade byN ω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester prevented both the proliferative effect of VEGF and Raf-1 activation by VEGF as measured by cell counting and the capacity of immunoprecipitated Raf-1 to phosphorylate syntide 2, a Raf-1-specific synthetic substrate. VEGF-induced proliferation and Raf-1 kinase activity were also inhibited by Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPs and KT5823, inhibitors of the regulatory and catalytic subunits of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), respectively. The ability of PKG to stimulate proliferation was verified by the observation that the PKG activator, 8-pCPT-cGMPs, stimulated both Raf-1 kinase activity and endothelial proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, recombinant catalytically active PKG phosphorylated and activated Raf-1 in a reconstituted system. Finally, Raf-1 immunoprecipitated from VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells coprecipitated with PKG, indicating a direct protein-protein interaction in activated cells. We conclude that VEGF induces increases in both proliferation and Raf-1 kinase activity in HUVECs and these activities are dependent on NO and its downstream effector, PKG.

VEGF1 is a endothelium-specific mitogen that potently stimulates angiogenesis, vasodilation, and microvascular hyperpermeability. Hypoxia up-regulates VEGF production and release in a wide variety of cells and organs (for a review, see Refs. 1Thomas K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar and 2Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). This relationship provides an elegant feedback loop by which decreased nutrient supply elicits the angiogenic signal and directs it to the target vascular endothelium (3Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4177) Google Scholar). NO may play an intimate role in the signaling pathways leading to VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation (4Morbidelli L. Chang C.-H. Douglas J.G. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H411-H415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Parenti A. Morbidelli L. Cui X.-L. Douglas J.G. Hood J.D. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4220-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet clear how nitric oxide mediates these actions. A primary downstream signaling effector of nitric oxide is cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). PKG activation occurs downstream from NO activation of soluble guanylate cyclase and the latter enzyme's ensuing conversion of GTP to cGMP. Cyclic GMP binds to four sites on the regulatory subunit of PKG, thereby activating the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. PKG phosphorylates select serine and threonine residues on its substrate proteins, leading to subsequent activation/inactivation signals in the cell (6Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. Komalavilas P. Boerth N. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 149-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the Ras-binding protein, Raf-1, by serine and threonine phosphorylation is a primary step for initiation of the MAP kinase cascade. Activation of this cascade has been shown to be a prerequisite for growth factor-induced proliferation in many systems (7Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Scopus (964) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase cascade is initiated by the binding of Ras to Raf-1, facilitating phosphorylation and activation of Raf-1 by an adjacent ligand-dependent protein kinase (8Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Activated Raf-1 phosphorylates and activates MAP kinase kinase, or MEK, which in turn phosphorylates and stimulates MAP kinase, or ERK. Activation of ERK stimulates downstream signaling, including activation of ternary control factor, c-Fos, and Elk-1. These events promote transcription and activation of the AP-1 promoter, which in turn initiates DNA synthesis and proliferation (9Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). The present study was designed to characterize the transduction pathways through which VEGF stimulates endothelial proliferation. Recent reports have shown that NO is an intermediary in this pathway and is necessary for both proliferation and ERK1/2 activation (5Parenti A. Morbidelli L. Cui X.-L. Douglas J.G. Hood J.D. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4220-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In order to better understand the mechanisms underlying this pathway we assessed the role of PKG activation in stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation and Raf-1 kinase activation in the VEGF signal cascade. Unless otherwise noted all supplies were purchased from Sigma. HUVECs were purchased from Clonetics. The cells were cultured at 37 °C on gelatin-coated plates in the basal nutrient medium, MCDB-131, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 20 units/ml heparin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin. HUVECs were passaged by trypsinization in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA. The cells used in this study were from passages 2 and 4. Endothelial cell proliferation was monitored as described previously (10Connolly D.T. Knight M.B. Harakas N.K. Wittwer A.J. Feder J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVECs (2 × 104/well) were incubated with described growth factors and pharmacological agents in MCDB-131 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% fetal bovine serum in 96-well plates. After a 3-day incubation, cellular acid phosphatase was measured using a Abacus kit (CLONTECH) according to manufacturer's instructions. Endothelial cell proliferation is quantified as units of optical density measured at 405 nm. These values were standardized by comparison to measurements made by cell counting with a hemocytometer under each pharmacological environment. After a 10-min treatment with VEGF (Peprotech), confluent 60-mm dishes of treated (or untreated control) HUVECs were rinsed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 0.5 ml of TME lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mg/ml Pefabloc™, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were prepared by subjecting samples to two to three freeze-thaw cycles, sonication for 3 s, shearing with a 21-gauge needle, and centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g. Protein concentration in the supernatant was quantified using the bicinchoninic acid protocol (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The lysates were subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation at 4 °C with either anti-Raf-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-PKG (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) polyclonal antibodies. Immune complexes were recovered by addition of protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz), incubation overnight at 4 °C, and centrifugation. The beads were washed once with TME buffer, twice with TTBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween), and once more with TME buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were removed by boiling in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% acrylamide, 1.5-mm thick slab gel). Proteins then were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) by electroblotting. The membrane was blocked for 12 h at 4 °C in TTBS containing SuperblockTM (Pierce), and incubated with antibodies against either H-Ras, Raf-1, pan-PKC (Santa Cruz), or PKG for 12 h at 4 °C. After washing, the membrane was incubated with 0.1 μg/ml donkey anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase; peroxidase activity was visualized using the SuperSignalTM enhanced chemiluminescence substrate system (Pierce). Raf-1 protein kinase activity was determined in vitro using the synthetic peptide, syntide 2 (Santa Cruz), as a substrate. The phosphotransferase assay was performed by incubating Raf-1 immunoprecipitates along with the exogenous substrate for 20 min at 30 °C in 40 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MnCl2, 100 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The assay was terminated by spotting 20 μl of the reaction mix onto pieces of P81 phosphocellulose paper. The filters were washed four times for 15 min in 0.85% phosphoric acid. The syntide 2-associated 32P radioactivity bound to the filters was quantitated by scintillation counting. Reconstitution experiments were performed using recombinant catalytically active PKG (Upstate Biotechnology). In these experiments phosphotransfer activity was visualized using MEK-1-glutathioneS-transferase (Upstate Biotechnology) as a substrate, followed by size fractionation on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel drying, and autoradiography. Data is expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparisons of data from different groups were made by analysis of variance followed by a Fisher's test of least significant differences. For comparison of two variables where paired data were available, paired t tests were used. Probability values <0.05 were considered significant. The goal of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms of VEGF-induced proliferation in human endothelial cells. Recent reports have shown that in bovine coronary venular endothelial cells blocking NO production withl-NAME interfered with VEGF-stimulated proliferation and ERK 1/2 activation (4Morbidelli L. Chang C.-H. Douglas J.G. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H411-H415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Parenti A. Morbidelli L. Cui X.-L. Douglas J.G. Hood J.D. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4220-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Activation of the MAP kinase system has been shown to be a requirement for growth factor-stimulated mitogenesis in many systems (7Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Scopus (964) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether this held true in human endothelial cells stimulated with VEGF, HUVECs were serum-starved for 24 h, pretreated with the appropriate blockers for 30 min, and assayed for proliferation and Raf-1 activation. PD 98059, which inhibits MAP kinase kinase (MEK) activity, effectively blocked VEGF-mediated proliferation as did the NOS inhibitor,l-NAME, indicating that activation of both the NO generating system and the MAP kinase cascade are necessary for the proliferative response of VEGF in HUVECs (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore,l-NAME also prevented VEGF-stimulated Raf-1 kinase activity, indicating that activation of the NO pathway is necessary for stimulation of this upstream effector of the MAP kinase pathway (Fig. 1 B). The classical downstream target of the NO pathway is protein kinase G. To determine if this protein kinase played a role in VEGF-mediated mitogenesis, blockers of either the regulatory (Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPs) or catalytic (KT5823) domain were used to pretreat HUVECs in proliferation and Raf-1 kinase assays. cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) can be cross-activated by cGMP. To test the possibility that PKA was playing a role in this system, some cells were pretreated with the PKA inhibitor, Rp-8-pCPT-cAMPs, and assayed. VEGF activates phospholipase C (11Brock T.A. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar) and consequently protein kinase C (12O'Brian C.A. Ward N.E. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1989; 8: 199-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), a reported activator of Raf-1 kinase (13Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Humme R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar); therefore, we also tested the effects of bisindolylmaleimide, a protein kinase C blocker, on VEGF-stimulated proliferation and Raf-1 kinase activation. Neither bisindolylmaleimide nor Rp-8-pCPT-cAMPs interfered with VEGF-induced mitogenesis, while PKG blockers prevented VEGF-induced proliferation (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, whereas PKG blockade prevented Raf-1 activation, neither down-regulation of PKC by 24-h pretreatment with phorbol esters or bisindolylmaleimide I nor PKA inhibition with Rp-8-pCPT-cAMPs significantly curbed the Raf-1 kinase activation elicited by VEGF (Fig. 2 B). This indicates that PKG, the downstream effector of NO, stimulates Raf-1 kinase and proliferation in HUVECs. Activation of the MAP kinase cascade by growth factors has been shown to involve Raf-1 interaction with membrane-bound Ras (14Egan S.E. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 781-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that, while this association is necessary, it is not sufficient to activate Raf-1 in the absence of an associated serine-threonine protein kinase (8Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). To determine if VEGF-stimulation induced a similar interaction of Raf-1 with Ras and Raf-1 with PKG or PKC, we immunoprecipitated Raf-1 from control and treated HUVECs and used Western blot analysis to determine which proteins were associated with it. Raf electrophoretic mobility was noticeably retarded (“band shift”) by VEGF treatment compared with control cells (Fig. 3 A). The retardation of Raf mobility has been previously reported to correlate with increased phosphorylation of Raf (15Molloy C.J. Taylor D.S. Weber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7338-7345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The band shift was ameliorated by pretreatment of cells with l-NAME or Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPs, but not by Rp-8-pCPT-cAMPs. Treatment with 8-pCPT-cGMPs also caused a band shift, but the population of the immunoprecipitated Raf that showed electrophoretic retardation was not as complete as that witnessed with VEGF treatment. While treatment with VEGF for 5 min increased Raf-1 association with Ras (Fig. 3 B) and PKG (Fig. 3 C), no PKC association could be detected (Fig. 3 D). The efficiency of the PKC antibody was confirmed by treatment in medium containing 1% serum (Fig. 3 D). These observations were further corroborated by the findings that PKG immunoprecipitates contained Raf and Ras in VEGF-treated cells, but not in control untreated cells (Fig. 3 E). Interestingly, although pretreatment with NOS or PKG inhibitors blocked Raf-1 activation, as visualized in this assay as a Raf-1 bandshift (Fig. 3 A), pretreatment with NOS or PKG inhibitors did not completely repress Raf-1 association with PKG or Ras. This seems to indicate that while NOS activity is necessary for PKG activation it is not necessary for Raf-1 protein localization. Together these results suggest that PKG may serve as the Ras-associated activator of Raf-1 in the VEGF-activated MAP kinase cascade. While both the necessity of PKG for VEGF-stimulated activation of Raf-1, and the PKG association with Raf-1 in the VEGF-treated cells, strongly infer that PKG is the activator of Raf-1, the mechanism is not clear. One possibility is that PKG directly phosphorylates Raf-1 leading to its activation. The capacity of PKG to phosphorylate and activate Raf-1 has not been previously reported. To test this possibility, Raf-1 immunoprecipitated from HUVECs, recombinant catalytically active PKG, and catalytically inactive MEK-1-glutathione S-transferase (Raf-1 substrate) were incubated in kinase buffer with [γ-32P]ATP, then fractionated on a polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography. Combining PKG, Raf-1, and MEK resulted in the appearance of a Raf-1 and MEK phosphorylation band, while neither Raf-1 alone nor PKG alone were capable of phosphorylating MEK (Fig. 4 A). This indicates that the PKG → Raf-1 → MEK cascade is feasible. In order to ascertain if PKG activation was sufficient for stimulation of HUVEC proliferation and Raf-1 activity, cells were serum-starved for 24 h, treated with the PKG activator 8-pCPT-cGMPs, and assayed. PKG activation resulted in both an increase in Raf-1 kinase activity and endothelial cell proliferation (Fig. 4, B and C). VEGF is an endothelial specific mitogen released by a variety of cell types. The rate of VEGF production and release into the extracellular fluid is increased in hypoxia, thus providing a rational explanation for the dependence of angiogenesis on tissuepO2 (16Shima D.T. Adamis A.P. Ferrara N. Yeo K.-T. Folkman J. D'Amore P.A. Mol. Med. 1995; 2: 64-71Google Scholar, 17Banai S. Shweiki D. Pinson A. Chandra M. Lazarovici G. Keshet E. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). VEGF isoforms are ligands for two receptor tyrosine kinases, flt1 and flk1/KDR (18deVries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). The lower affinity flk1/KDR receptor is responsible for activation of several stages of angiogenesis, including detachment, migration, proliferation, and tube formation (19Seethram L. Gotoh N. Maru Y. Neufield G. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF was first identified as vascular permeability factor, reflecting the increased microvascular permeability associated with endothelial cell detachment processes (1Thomas K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 2Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr.

Chem. 1989; 264: 20017-20024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ligation of flk1/KDR also leads to activation of phospholipase Cγ (11Brock T.A. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar) and the formation of diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate; the former promotes PKC activity and the latter elicits the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (21De Jonge H.W. Van Heugten H.A. Lamers J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 93-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The elevated calcium stimulates a constitutive form of nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS) found in endothelial cells and initiates production of nitric oxide and citrulline from the substrate l-arginine (22Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nitric oxide, a key messenger in the phospholipase C/ecNOS/soluble guanylate cyclase/PKG signaling pathway, stimulates endothelial proliferation at low to moderate concentrations (e.g. 10 μm or less) (23Ziche M. Morbidelli L. Masini E. Granger H.J. Geppetti P. Ledda F. Bochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 1198-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Ziche M. Morbidelli L. Masini E. Amerini W. Granger H.J. Maggi C.A. Geppetti P. ledda F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2036-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). VEGF has previously been shown to stimulate NO production acutely and chronically in HUVECs (25van der Zee R. Murohara T. Luo Z. Zollmann F. Passeri J. Lekutat C. Isner J.M. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 26Hood J.D. Meininger C.J. Ziche M. Granger H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1054-H1058PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the increased rate of endothelial cell division elicited by VEGF is NO-dependent, as evidenced by the ability of inhibitors of ecNOS, soluble guanylate cyclase, and PKG to prevent mitogenesis (4Morbidelli L. Chang C.-H. Douglas J.G. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H411-H415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although NO can function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor through the S-nitrosylation of cysteine in p21Ras (27Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 28Lander H.M. Jacovina A.T. Davis R.J. Tauras J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19705-19709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), the role of this process in signaling endothelial cell proliferation in response to VEGF must be limited because inhibition of ecNOS does not prevent complexing of Raf with Ras, yet inhibition of signaling steps downstream from NO production prevent the mitogenic response. Activated Ras binds Raf, facilitating the phosphorylation of Raf by a serine-threonine kinase (29Marshall M.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). PKC has been reported to activate Raf in several systems (30Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 31Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol.

Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 231-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, PKC blockade by inhibitors of the conventional and novel PKC isozymes that might be activated by phospholipase Cγ (33Hofmann J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 34Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F.

Furthermore, PKC inhibitor pretreatment had no effect on VEGF-induced proliferation of HUVECs. Also, the NOS inhibitorl-NAME blocked VEGF-stimulated Raf-1 activation and HUVEC proliferation, arguing strongly against PKC involvement. Nitric oxide inhibits PKC in several (36Hirata K. Kuroda R. Sakoda T. Katayama M. Inoue N. Suematsu M. Kawashima S. Yokoyama M. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 180-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27180-27185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) systems, suggesting that, if PKC was important in this cascade, VEGF-induced Raf-1 activation and proliferation would be stimulated by NOS blockade, not inhibited. Recently we found that VEGF-induced NO stimulation of the MAP kinase system is dependent on cGMP production (5Parenti A. Morbidelli L. Cui X.-L. Douglas J.G. Hood J.D. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4220-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have found that at high concentrations cGMP can “crossover” and activate PKA (38Cornwell T.L. Arnold E.A. Boerth N.J. Lincoln T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1405-C1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Forte L.R. Thorne P.K. Eber S.L. Krause W.J. Freeman R. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C607-C615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whose regulatory site is very similar to that of PKG (40Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Because PKA is a reported inhibitor of Raf-1 (41Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Mizuno T. Hiroi Y. Shiojima I. Takano H. Kinugawa K. Kohmoto O. Takahashi T. Yazaki Y. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2491-2501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 42Hafner S. Adler H.S. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Ueffing M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), it is doubtful that transactivation of PKA by cGMP has a significant effect on our observations of PKG-induced Raf-1 activation. Nevertheless, in order to ensure that our observations were not due to PKA transactivation, we carefully used PKG agonist and antagonist doses in ranges that do not affect PKA activity and in some experiments ran trials with the highly selective inhibitor of PKA, Rp-8-pCPT-cAMPs. The PKA antagonist had no effect on VEGF-stimulated Raf-1 activation or proliferation, indicating that cross-talk with the PKA system was not playing a significant role in the VEGF system. Unlike cAMP, which acts almost exclusively through protein kinase A activation, cGMP has several intracellular target proteins: PKG, cGMP-gated ion channels, and cGMP-stimulated or cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterases (43Lohmann S.M. Vaandrager A.B. Smolenski A. Walter U. De Jonge H.R. Trends Biochem Sci. 1997; 22: 307-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In the present study, inhibition of PKG activity by blocking either the regulatory site with Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPs or the catalytic domain with KT5823 throttled VEGF-induced Raf activation and HUVEC proliferation. On the other hand, stimulation of PKG in the absence of VEGF led to an increase in endothelial cell Raf-1 kinase activity and proliferation. Thus, our findings are the first to demonstrate a key role for protein kinase G in activation of the MAP kinase cascade. The dependence of VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation on the NO signaling pathway is explained by the phosphorylation of Raf-1 by activated PKG. This correlates well with other recent studies that have found that PKG activators stimulate gene expression of c-Fos, c-Jun, and transcription from AP-1 responsive promoters (44Gudi T. Huvar I. Meinecke M. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4597-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 45Pilz R.B. Suhasini M. Idriss S. Meinkoth J.L. Boss G.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). An important commonalty of these gene products is that they are all downstream of Raf-1 activation and upstream of MAP kinase-stimulated proliferation (46Seger, R., and Krebs, E. G. FASEB J. 9, 726–735Google Scholar). In the present study, reconstitution of the converging components of the NO and Raf-1/MEK pathways strongly supports the idea that PKG modulates the MAP kinase cascade by phosphorylation and activation of the Raf-1 protein. The activation of Raf-1 in the reconstituted system is evidenced by its ability to phosphorylate a catalytically inactive form of MEK. Addition of catalytically active PKG led to phosphorylation of Raf-1 and subsequent phosphorylation of the catalytically inactive MEK. Removal of either Raf-1 or PKG prevented the MEK phosphorylation. Coprecipitation of Raf-1 and PKG in HUVECs also supports the central concept that PKG activates the MAP kinase cascade via phosphorylation of Raf-1. However, the association of PKG with Raf-1 and Raf-1 with Ras appears to be independent of PKG activation. This suggests that complexing of PKG, Ras, and Raf-1 is through a NO-independent mechanism, perhaps dependent on Ras."

They all show sequence-independent transport of all possible di- and tripeptides as well as of a variety of peptidomimetics. We used the mammalian intestinal peptide transporter PEPT1 as a model to define the molecular basis for its multisubstrate specificity. By employing computational analysis of possible substrate conformations in combination with transport assays using transgenic yeast cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing PEPT1, the minimal structural requirements for substrate binding and transport were determined. Based on a series of medium chain fatty acids bearing an amino group as a head group (ω-amino fatty acids, ω-AFA), we show that electrogenic transport by PEPT1 requires as a minimum the two ionized head groups separated by at least four methylene groups. Consequently, a > 500 pm < 630 pm distance between the two charged centers (carboxylic carbon and amino nitrogen) is sufficient for substrate recognition and transport. Removal of either the amino group or the carboxyl group in ω-AFA maintained the affinity of the compound for interaction with the transporter but abolished the capability for electrogenic transport.

Theis S. Daniel H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 656-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). At the amino acid level the PEPT11 proteins show significant homologies to peptide transporters isolated from bacteria, fungi, and plants that all belong to the PTR family of proton-dependent peptide transporters (6Steiner H.-Y. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The gene products are plasma membrane carrier proteins that catalyze electrogenic uphill peptide transport by coupling of substrate translocation to the movement of H3O+ with the transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient providing the driving force (7Daniel H. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 154: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The physiological role of PEPT1 lies in the absorption of peptide bound amino acids from the intestinal tract after their release by enzymatic breakdown of dietary or endogenous proteins. In addition, the high availability of orally active peptide-based drugs such as almost all aminocephalosporin antibiotics, ACE-inhibitors like captopril, or peptidase inhibitors like bestatin results from their active transport mediated by PEPT1 (2Boll M.

Free amino acids and tetrapeptides appear not to be accepted as substrates. Although transport of peptides and peptidomimetics occurs in a stereospecific manner (10Wenzel U. Thwaites D.T. Daniel H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the transporter discriminates possible substrates only by differences in affinity for binding and/or maximal transport capacity. Based on the naturally occurring amino acids provided either as l- ord-amino enantiomers and by the huge number of different peptide-like xenobiotics, almost 1 × 106 potential substrates can be identified. Considering the wide distribution of this novel class of solute transporters throughout nature and their nutritional as well as pharmacological importance, identification of the minimal structural determinants of substrates affecting their affinity and capability for transport would greatly advance our understanding of these carrier proteins. As a starting point, we employed the transgenic yeast system to screen a large variety of different compounds to identify a common structural motif that determines the affinity for the binding site of PEPT1. From these studies, it became obvious that the existence of a zwitterionic amino acid functionality separated by a distinct molecular distance was the most important feature. We therefore rationalized that PEPT1 should be able to interact with ω-amino fatty acids (ω-AFA) and consequently studied binding and transport of a series of ω-AFA. Because the amino fatty acids represent simple structures, a modeling of their possible conformations by semiempirical and ab initio methods and taking unspecific solvation by water into account could be performed. The capability of PEPT1 for transport of ω-AFA was demonstrated in two different expression systems by using a radiolabeled ω-AFA as well as by measuring substrate-induced inward currents in voltage clamped Xenopus oocytes expressing the carrier. Employing the ω-AFA in combination with the modeling of these novel substrates that possess only two functional groups and a hydrocarbon backbone, we have set the basis for defining the minimal molecular requirements for substrate transport by PEPT1. ω-AFA and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Custom-synthesized3H-(d)-phenylalanine-(l)-alanine (3H-d-Phe-Ala) with a specific activity of 9 Ci·mmol−1 was purchased from Zeneca (Billingham, UK).14C-6-amino-hexanoic acid (14C-6-AHA), with a specific activity of 55 mCi·mmol−1, was obtained from BioTrend (Köln, Germany). 3-o-[methyl-3H]-d-glucose (3H-methyl-d-glucose) with a specific activity of 86.7 Ci·mmol−1 was obtained from DuPont (Dreieich, Germany). The P. pastoris strain was cultured as described in the manual Version E of the Pichia expression kit (Invitrogen, San Diego). Construction of the Pichia strain expressing the rabbit PEPT1 and the isogenic control strain (GS-pPIC3L) has been described previously (5Döring F. Theis S. Daniel H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 656-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the transgenic yeast strain GS-PEPT1, the PEPT1-cDNA was placed under the transcriptional control of the AOX1 promotor, which is inducible by methanol. To induce PEPT1 expression, cells were initially grown in a glycerol-containing medium (1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 4 × 10−5% biotin and 1% glycerol) and then switched to a medium containing 1% methanol. Uptake of 3H-Phe-Ala or 14C-6-AHA was measured 18–36 h after induction. Cells were pelleted at 3000 × g for 10 min, washed once with 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (PPB, pH 7.0), and resuspended to 1 OD (one OD equals approximately 5 × 107 cells)·10 μl−1 in 50 mm PPB. Uptake measurements were performed at 22–24 °C by using a rapid filtration technique with Schleicher & Schuell filters (ME 25 type, 0.45 μm pore size) as described previously (5Döring F. Theis S. Daniel H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 656-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Uptake was initiated by rapidly mixing 10 μl of cell suspension with 40 μl of 50 mm PPB containing 0.1 μCi of 14C-6-AHA or3H-d-Phe-Ala. Incubation of cells was terminated by addition of 3 ml of ice-cold 50 mm PPB, followed by filtration. The filter was washed twice with 3 ml of ice-cold buffer, and radioactivity associated with the filter was determined. Kinetics of 14C-6-AHA influx at pH 7.0 was determined at 30 min of incubation in the presence of increasing concentration of substrate (0.001–10 mm), and corresponding uptake rates in control cells were subtracted. Competition studies with 3H-d-Phe-Ala or14C-6-AHA serving as substrates and selected test compounds serving as competitors (0.001–50 mm) were performed at pH 7.0. Surgically removed oocytes were separated by collagenase treatment and handled as described previously (2Boll M. Markovich D. Weber W.-M. Korte H. Daniel H. Murer H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 429: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Individual oocytes were injected with 13.6 nl of water (controls) or 13.6 nl of RNA-solution containing 13.6 ng of the complementary RNAs of PEPT1 or SGLT1 followed by incubation in Barth′s solution for 5 days at 14 °C. Flux studies with oocytes expressing PEPT1 were performed in a buffer composed of 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2and 15 mm MES/Tris at pH 6.0. Influx of3H-methyl-glucose in oocytes expressing SGLT1 were performed in a buffer composed of 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 15 mm Hepes/Tris at pH 7.5. The 2-electrode voltage clamp technique was applied to characterize responses in inward current (I) to substrate addition in oocytes injected with 13.6 ng of transporter cRNA of PEPT1. Steady state currents were measured in the absence and the presence of increasing concentrations of the test compounds at pH 6.0, whereas the membrane potential in oocytes was clamped to −60 mV. Current-voltage relationships were recorded as described previously (2Boll M. Markovich D. Weber W.-M. Korte H. Daniel H. Murer H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 429: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The semiempirical calculations were performed using the AM1-SM2 solvation model (11Cramer C.J. Truhlar D.G. J. Am. Chem.

Science. 1992; 256: 213-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) as implemented into the SPARTAN program package (Wavefunction, Irvine, CA). Theab initio optimizations were performed on the RHF/6–31+G* level, starting from gas phase geometries as obtained with the AM1 method. The energy of solvation by water was modeled by using the polarizable continuum model (13Miertus S. Scrocco E. Tomasi J. Chem. Phys. 1981; 55: 117-119Crossref Scopus (8182) Google Scholar) implemented as the SCIPCM method into the GAUSSIAN 94 program package (14Frisch, M. J., Trucks, G. W., Schlegel, H. B., Gill, P. M.

All computations were performed with an IBM RS/6000 cluster of the computing center of the Justus-Liebig-University of Giessen. All calculations (linear as well as nonlinear regression analysis) were performed by using PRISM (GraphPAD, Los Angeles, CA). For each variable, at least two independent experiments (8–10 oocytes, 2 yeast preparations) were carried out. Data are given as the mean ± S.E. Significance of differences between the uptake rates and constants calculated were determined by a nonpaired t test. Based on initial observations during screening of potential substrates, we hypothesized that amino fatty acids bearing an amino group as a head group (ω-amino fatty acids, ω-AFA) could serve as substrates of PEPT1. By using a series of ω-AFA possessing 3–10 CH2 units, we demonstrate here that these compounds indeed interact with the substrate binding site of the transporter. InP. pastoris, cells expressing PEPT1 uptake of3H-d-Phe-Ala was dose dependently inhibited by the ω-AFA when the compounds contained four or more CH2units in the backbone (Fig. 1 a). In the case of 4-ABA (or GABA), there was no noticeable affinity. The EC50 values derived from competition curves with3H-d-Phe-Ala serving as a substrate ranged for the different ω-AFA between 0.30 ± 0.04 mm and 1.14 ± 0.06 mm (Table I). The apparent affinities for the ω-AFA found are very similar to those obtained for di- and tripeptides when assayed under identical experimental conditions (5Döring F. Theis S. Daniel H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 656-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Table IAffinity of selected compounds for inhibition of H-d-Phe-Ala influx into P. pastoris cells expressing PEPT1CompoundEC50 valuemmω-Amino fatty acids 4-ABA (NH3-(CH2)3-COO)>50 5-APA (NH3-(CH2)4-COO)1.14 ± 0.06 6-AHA (NH3-(CH2)5-COO)0.73 ± 0.07 7-AHA (NH3-(CH2)6-COO)1.09 ± 0.03 8-AOA (NH3-(CH2)7-COO)0.30 ± 0.04 11-AUA (NH3-(CH2)10-COO)0.58 ± 0.03Amines and fatty acids Hexylamine (NH3-(CH2)5-CH3)6.19 ± 0.08 Octylamine (NH3-(CH2)7-CH3)0.37 ± 0.02 Hexanoic acid (CH3-(CH2)5-COO)2.75 ± 0.07 Octanoic acid (CH3-(CH2)7-COO)1.36 ± 0.07Other compounds 5-Amino-4-oxo-pentanoic acid0.27 ± 0.03 2-Amino-octanoic acid>50 Lysine (pH 7.0)4.89 ± 0.22 Lysine (pH 8.0)2.07 ± 0.05 Arginine (pH 7.0)14.98 ± 0.10 Arginine (pH 8.0)8.14 ± 0.08Uptake of 3H-d-Phe-Ala (2 μCi · ml−1) into the Pichia cells expressing PEPT1 (1 OD) was measured for 30 min of incubation at pH 7.0 or at the pH indicated in the presence of increasing concentrations (0.001–50 mm) of competitors.

EC50 values were derived by the least-squares method based on a competition curve with one component and r 2 for regression was in all cases ≥ 0.98. Because competition with a dipeptide for binding at the substrate binding site does not establish that a compound is indeed transported, we employed 14C-6-AHA as a representative structure to assess its transport characteristics in Pichia cells mediated by PEPT1. As shown in Fig. 1 b,14C-6-AHA was taken up into the transgenic yeast cells but not into the control cells. Uptake of 14C-6-AHA as a function of substrate concentration displayed saturation kinetics mediated by a single transport site (Fig. 1 b, inset). The apparent K 0.5 value for 6-AHA influx was 0.92 ± 0.07 mm, and the EC50 value for d-Phe-Ala serving as the competitor was 0.84 ± 0.12 mm. To demonstrate that the transport of ω-AFA by PEPT1 is independent from the expression system used, we additionally employed oocytes expressing PEPT1. As shown in Fig. 1 c, the EC50 values for inhibition of influx of 3H-d-Phe-Ala into oocytes by 6-AHA (0.98 ± 0.05 mm) and 8-AOA (1.27 ± 0.08 mm) were similar to those obtained in the yeast expression system. 14C-6-AHA influx into oocytes expressing PEPT1 as a function of substrate concentration also displayed saturation kinetics (Fig. 1 d) with an apparent K 0.5 value of 1.21 ± 0.32 mm. Based on these observations obtained in two different heterologous expression systems, we conclude that ω-AFAs with more than 3 CH2 units in the backbone are recognized by the substrate binding site of PEPT1 and interact with affinities that are comparable with those of dipeptides. To investigate whether the different ω-AFA are transported electrogenically by PEPT1, substrate-induced inward currents were measured using the 2-electrode voltage clamp setup. When a PEPT1-expressing oocyte in the voltage clamp mode was perfused with 2.5 mm ω-AFA, positive inward currents were obtained for all substrates except for 4-ABA (Fig. 2 a). Whereas currents induced by some of the ω-AFA were not as high as that induced by 2.5 mm Gly-Gln in the same oocyte, 8-AOA elicited a current of almost identical value. Moreover, when 6-AHA- and 8-AOA-mediated currents were determined as a function of membrane potential, we obtained I-V curves that are characteristic for PEPT1 and almost identical to those recorded for Gly-Gln (Fig. 2 b). This strongly suggests that the influx of ω-AFA is, like that of dipeptides, electrogenic in nature as a consequence of cotranslocation of H3O+ along the transmembrane potential providing the driving force. The unexpected finding that simple aliphatic chains possessing an amino and carboxyl group serve as substrates addresses the question of whether both head groups are required for transport. We therefore investigated if compounds with aliphatic chains of ≥ 5 CH2 units carrying only one terminal group, either an amino group (amines) or a carboxyl group (fatty acids), were able to interact with PEPT1. As demonstrated by competition studies, both the fatty acids and the amines inhibited 3H-d-Phe-Ala influx into PEPT1-expressing P. pastoris cells in a dose-dependent manner. The EC50 values obtained (Table I) ranged between 0.37 ± 0.02 mm (octylamine) and 6.19 ± 0.08 mm (hexylamine). In the case of the fatty acids, EC50 values of 1.36 ± 0.07 and 2.75 ± 0.07 mm were obtained. The C8 compounds therefore displayed a 2–15-fold higher affinity than the corresponding C6 compounds. To assess whether the amines and fatty acids also elicited inward currents in oocytes expressing PEPT1, cells were superperfused with 2.5 mm octylamine or octanoic acid in the voltage clamp mode. In the same oocyte in which perfusion with 2.5 mm Gly-Gln induced significant inward currents (170 nA at −60 mV), the amines and the fatty acids failed to induce measurable inward currents (Fig. 2 a). This suggested that the compounds can interact with PEPT1 but cannot be transported electrogenically. To demonstrate that the amines and fatty acids inhibited PEPT1 specifically and inhibition is not caused via nonspecific interaction with the cell membrane, we used the sodium-dependent glucose transporter SGLT1 as a control. Functional expression of SGLT1 in oocytes was established by a 50-fold increase in uptake of 3H-methyl-d-glucose in cRNA-injected oocytes compared with water-injected control cells. As shown in Table II, influx of3H-methyl-d-glucose was reduced by 88.0 ± 3.1% in the presence of unlabeled glucose and almost abolished by the specific inhibitor phloridzin. However, neither high concentrations (5 mm) of octylamine nor octanoic acid inhibited SGLT1-mediated 3H-methyl-d-glucose influx into oocytes. Taken together, the medium chain amines and fatty acids obviously interact specifically with PEPT1 but do not show electrogenic transport.Table IIUptake of H-methyl-d-glucose into Xenopus oocytes expressing SGLT1 in the presence of selected compoundsCompoundUptake% of controlNone100.0 ± 7.75 mm d-Glucose12.0 ± 3.10.5 mmPhloridzin5.5 ± 1.28-AOA115.2 ± 10.3Octylamine95.0 ± 4.3Octanoic acid109.1 ± 21.5Uptake of 3H-methyl-d-glucose (10 μCi · ml−1) into oocytes expressing SGLT1 was measured for 30 min of incubation in the absence or the presence of 0.5 mmphloridzin or 5 mm other compounds.

That amino acids are not transported by the epithelial peptide transporters has been established in numerous studies employing radiolabeled amino acids as well as by using electrophysiological methods (1Fei Y.-J.

Based on our observations with the ω-AFA, one would assume that at least the dibasic amino acids lysine and arginine interact with PEPT1. Both possess the right backbone length (≥ 4 CH2 groups) and the head groups to mimic the ω-AFA,i.e. an amino group in the side chain and the carboxyl group bound to the α-carbon. However, because both amino acids carry an additional α-amino group close to the carboxyl group, one could rationalize that this specific configuration prevents lysine and arginine from interaction with PEPT1. To test this hypothesis, we used lysine and arginine derivatives with protected α-amino groups (N-α-Z-l-lysine, N-α-Z-l-arginine) as inhibitors of 3H-d-Phe-Ala influx into the transgenic Pichia cells. At a concentration of 5 mm, both amino acid derivatives significantly (p < 0.001) reduced3H-d-Phe-Ala uptake by 69.7 ± 5.8% (N-α-Z-l-lysine) and 48.6 ± 5.5% (N-α-Z-l-arginine). The free amino acids reduced dipeptide influx at 5 mm by 48.1 ± 3.5% (lysine) and by only 11.8 ± 4.4% (arginine). In addition to the use of derivatized amino acids, we compared lysine and arginine interaction with PEPT1 at pH 7.0 and 8.0. Because of different pK a values of the amino groups, the α-amino group becomes significantly more deprotonated at pH 8.0 than the amino group in the side chain. As shown in Table I, increasing pH from 7.0 to 8.0 decreased the EC50 value for lysine inhibition of dipeptide influx from 4.89 ± 0.22 to 2.07 ± 0.05 mm and the EC50 value for arginine from 14.98 ± 0.10 to 8.14 ± 0.08 mm. In comparison, the affinity of zwitterionic substrates remains generally unaffected by these changes in pH as shown previously (2Boll M. Markovich D. Weber W.-M. Korte H. Daniel H. Murer H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 429: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 8Amasheh S. Wenzel U. Boll M. Dorn D. Weber W.-M. Clauss W. Daniel H. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This suggested that the positive charge of the α-amino group may indeed impair the affinity of the amino acids for interaction with PEPT1. To mimic the configuration of the amino and carboxyl group at the α-carbon as given in amino acids, we used 2-amino-octanoic acid (2-AOA) and determined its affinity for PEPT1 in comparison to 8-AOA (Table I). When the amino group was moved from the 8 to the 2 position, the compound failed to cause any inhibition of dipeptide influx (EC50 > 50 mm), whereas 8-AOA displayed a high affinity for inhibition with an EC50 value of 0.30 ± 0.04 mm. The results of this series of experiments strongly supports the proposal that charged amino and carboxyl groups in close proximity prevent the ligands from interacting with the transporter binding site, whereas when separated by the proper spacer (≥ 4 CH2-groups), substrates can bind with a high affinity and get transported. As shown here, PEPT1 sharply discriminates in binding and transport between 4-ABA and 5-APA. We therefore decided to employ computational model analysis to predict the compounds possible conformations based on energy minimization calculations. The results are compiled in Table III. For our model calculations, glycine served as a paradigm. As expected and documented for this amino acid both experimentally (16Suenram R.D. Lovas F.J. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 1978; 72: 372-382Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and theoretically (17Gordon M.S. Jensen J.H. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 536-543Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar), in the gas phase, the neutral form is the most stable one. At the highest level of theory, the zwitterionic form of glycine is calculated to be less stable by 16–20 kcal/mol and proton transfer from the amino group to the carboxyl group to yield the neutral form occurs without a barrier. Even when glycine is complexed with two water molecules, the zwitterion is calculated to be less stable but now proton transfer is hindered (18Jensen H.J. Gordon M.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8159-8170Crossref Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Only in the presence of a stronger basic group such as in arginine may these stabilities be reversed (19Price W.D. Jokusch R.A.

Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria, is an obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasite. The life cycle of the organism includes a number of specialized invasive (zoite) stages. In the vertebrate host, replication of the parasite in circulating erythrocytes is initiated when the cells are invaded by merozoites. The parasite replicates asexually within the infected erythrocyte to produce a number of progeny merozoites. Upon rupture of the host cell, these are released to invade fresh erythrocytes and perpetuate the blood stage cycle. Erythrocyte invasion by the malaria merozoite has been the subject of intensive study, since intervention strategies that prevent invasion would effectively block both replication of the parasite and the associated clinical disease.Electron microscopic studies have shown that erythrocyte invasion by the malaria merozoite takes place in a number of discrete stages. Initial reversible attachment of the parasite to the red cell surface is rapidly followed by reorientation, the formation of an irreversible junction between the apical prominence of the merozoite and the host cell surface, and finally entry of the parasite into the cell by a mechanism resembling a form of induced endocytosis (1Dvorak J.A.

The process is facilitated by the controlled release of the contents of three types of secretory organelles, called rhoptries, micronemes, and dense granules, situated at or toward the apical domain of the merozoite (2Bannister L.H. Butcher G.A. Dennis E.D. Mitchell G.H. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,5Bannister L.H. Mitchell G.H. Butcher G.A. Dennis E.D.

There is extensive evidence indicating an essential role for parasite-derived proteases in invasion. Invasion by P. falciparum merozoites is blocked in the presence of the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)1 (7Dejkriengkraikhul P. Wilairat P. Z. Parasitenkd. 1983; 69: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and invasion by merozoites of a number of Plasmodium species is prevented by chymostatin (8Dutta G.P. Banyal H.S. Indian J.

The inhibitory effect of chymostatin on invasion can be reversed by pretreatment of target erythrocytes with chymotrypsin (10Dluzewski A.R. Rangachari K. Wilson R.J.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1986; 62: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting that the chymostatin-sensitive step in invasion involves an essential, parasite-induced proteolytic modification of the red cell surface (10Dluzewski A.R. Rangachari K. Wilson R.J.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1986; 62: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Braun-Breton C. Blisnick T. Jouin H. Barale J.C. Rabilloud T. Langsley G.

Parasitol. 1993; 62: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored malarial serine protease activity has been described that may be involved in this modification (14Braun-Breton C. Rosenberry T.L. Pereira da Silva L. Nature. 1988; 332: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Treatment of isolated, invasive merozoites of the simian malariaP. knowlesi with N-tosyl phenylalanylchloromethyl ketone or N-tosyl lysylchloromethyl ketone prevents primary attachment of the parasites to host cells, whereas chymostatin blocks a later stage in the invasion pathway, indicating that more than one distinct protease activity may be involved (15Hadley T. Aikawa M. Miller L.H. Exp. Parasitol. 1983; 55: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, a P. falciparum serine protease activity that mediates an essential processing and shedding of a major merozoite surface protein (merozoite surface protein-1; MSP-1) at invasion is highly sensitive to inhibition by PMSF but not by chymostatin (16Blackman M.J. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 17Blackman M.J. Chappel J.A. Shai S. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Parasite proteases involved in invasion are attractive potential targets for new rational approaches to antimalarial chemotherapy.Here we report the identification of a novel, single copy P. falciparum gene (denoted pfsub-1) encoding a member of the subtilisin-like serine protease superfamily (subtilases). The primary gene product is expressed in the latter stages of intracellular merozoite maturation, and is post-translationally modified during secretory transport in a manner consistent with it being processed to form a mature, enzymatically active product. The putative mature protease is concentrated in a subset of dense granules within the apical domain of free merozoites and then is released in a soluble form during erythrocyte invasion, suggesting that it may play a role in invasion. This is the first molecular characterization of a putative apicomplexan serine protease.DISCUSSIONThis report describes the first gene to be identified of any apicomplexan parasite that encodes a serine protease-like protein. We have not directly demonstrated any proteolytic activity associated with any pfsub-1 gene product, but a number of indications lead us to propose that p47 or its truncated, secreted product is likely to be an enzymatically active protease and that it may play a role in erythrocyte invasion.First, at the primary sequence level PfSUB-1 shows significant homology to known subtilases, and possesses all of the features known to be required of an active subtilase. Only four amino acid residues are completely conserved among known subtilases (34Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar); these are the catalytic triad residues (PfSUB-1 residues Asp374, His430, and Ser608) and a glycine residue (Gly606 in the PfSUB-1 sequence) two positions N-terminal to the active site serine. PfSUB-1 also possesses an asparagine (Asn522) at the position of the oxyanion hole residue; the only substitution acceptable at this position is that of an aspartate, found in the PC2 subfamily of kexin-like convertases (34Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). While many bacterial subtilisins are devoid of cysteine residues, an increasingly large number of subtilases are known to possess up to two intramolecular disulfide bonds within the catalytic domain (34Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). There are seven cysteine residues within the putative catalytic domain of PfSUB-1, and the reduction-sensitive mobility on SDS-PAGE of p47 is consistent with the presence of intramolecular disulfide bonds. Detailed homology-based molecular modeling of the putative PfSUB-1 catalytic domain 3M. Hirshberg, K. Henrick, C. Withers-Martinez, and M. Blackman, manuscript in preparation. supports this postulate. Thus, at the structural level, PfSUB-1 resembles a subtilase.Second, the proteolytic processing to which PfSUB-1 is subjected during secretory transport probably represents a process of enzyme activation common among subtilases. In a number of well studied examples, co-translational signal peptide cleavage allows folding of the subtilase catalytic domain, mediated by the intramolecular chaperone activity of the pro-domain (36Shinde U. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 442-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 48Baker D. Shiau A.K. Agard D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This is often (but not always) rapidly followed by autocatalytic cleavage of the pro-domain from the catalytic domain; this cleavage can take place in cis(intramolecular) or in trans (intermolecular) and in some cases simple pro-domain cleavage is sufficient to allow zymogen activation (49Ikemura H. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12959-12963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Volkov A. Jordan F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, there is a growing body of evidence that subtilase activation is often a substantially more complex process, which in eukaryotes may be intimately linked to correct routing of the proenzyme through the secretory pathway and final compartmentalization of the active enzyme (51Shennan K.I.J.

Here we have shown that the primarypfsub-1 gene product is subjected to at least two major post-translational processing steps. The first of these, conversion of the 82-kDa form, possibly via a 60/61-kDa intermediate, to the p54 form, takes place very rapidly following synthesis and therefore could represent an autocatalytic processing step triggered by signal peptide cleavage and co-translational folding within the lumen of the ER. The p54 form is then quantitatively converted to p47 in a slower, BFA-sensitive process. Further work is required to establish whether either or both of these processing events represent enzyme activation, but certainly they are wholly consistent with a putative activation pathway. If so, the process is clearly more complex than a simple one-step pro-domain removal. BFA sensitivity is a common feature of transport to secretory organelles in apicomplexan parasites (55Sadak A.

Today. 1996; 12: 308-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), but little is known about the structural requirements for correct sorting to these organelles (59Sam-Yellowe T.Y. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 308-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar); it is possible that part of the PfSUB-1 sequence could provide a targeting signal, as has been determined for other subtilases and yeast carboxypeptidase Y (52Zhou A. Paquet L. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21509-21516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,60Valls L.A. Winther J.R. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Third, the terminal intracellular PfSUB-1 processing product, p47, localizes to a subpopulation of dense granule-like organelles within the extreme apical domain of the merozoite and appears to be shed in a truncated, soluble form following merozoite release but before completion of erythrocyte invasion; no PfSUB-1-derived proteins were detectable in the newly invaded erythrocyte. These observations are in apparent conflict with the majority of the available data suggesting that dense granule secretion in apicomplexan parasites is a postinvasion event (2Bannister L.H. Butcher G.A. Dennis E.D. Mitchell G.H. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6Torii M. Adams J.H. Miller L.H. Aikawa M. Infect.

However, dense granules in Plasmodium are currently defined essentially on morphological criteria; there is a paucity of specific markers for these organelles, and indeed only two other malarial proteins, RESA/Pf155 and a 14-kDa protein denoted RIMA, have been previously localized to merozoite dense granules (41Culvenor J.G. Day K.P. Anders R.F. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1183-1187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 61Aikawa M. Torii M. Sjölander A. Berzins K. Perlmann P. Miller L.H. Exp.

It is therefore possible that distinct subpopulations of dense granules may exist in Plasmodium; there is evidence for this in the apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum (64Bonnin A. Gut J. Dubremetz J.F. Nelson R.G. Camerlynck P. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1995; 42: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and if so, these subpopulations may be functionally distinct and may undergo exocytosis at different stages of the invasion process. Our evidence that PfSUB-1 is released at invasion suggests that it could play a role in the process of erythrocyte entry. Anti-PfSUB-1m antibodies had no inhibitory effect on erythrocyte invasion by released merozoitesin vitro, but it is unclear whether these antibodies have access to PfSUB-1 in the intact merozoite or whether they can interfere with its function. The demonstration of enzymatic activity in native, merozoite-derived p47 or its truncated soluble product would be a step toward addressing this issue. Consistent with observations of other workers (65Rosenthal P.J. Kim K. McKerrow J.H. Leech J.H. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 816-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we have not been able to detect activity corresponding to p47 on gelatin substrate SDS-PAGE. 4M. Blackman, unpublished observations. However, the enzyme may be irreversibly denatured by exposure to SDS, and the insolubility of p47 in nonionic detergents precludes ready isolation and analysis of the merozoite-derived protein in a native state. These limitations could be overcome by recombinant expression of enzymatically active PfSUB-1, and this is a major priority of current work.If PfSUB-1 is involved in erythrocyte invasion, what precise role might the enzyme perform? The best characterized proteolytic event associated with erythrocyte invasion is the processing and shedding of a merozoite surface protein complex derived from the precursor protein MSP-1. A single proteolytic cleavage at a Leu-Asn motif within the membrane-bound component of this complex, known as secondary processing, releases the complex quantitatively from the surface of the merozoite as it enters the host erythrocyte (16Blackman M.J. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 17Blackman M.J. Chappel J.A. Shai S. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 1996; 83: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). MSP-1 secondary processing is thought to be essential for successful erythrocyte invasion, and it is mediated by a parasite-derived, calcium-dependent serine protease (16Blackman M.J. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 17Blackman M.J. Chappel J.A. Shai S. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this activity is exquisitely sensitive to inhibition by PMSF, but it is only poorly inhibited by even very high concentrations (up to 10 mm) of DFP (19Blackman M.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Given its apparent nonreactivity with DFP, its location in the merozoite, and the timing of its secretion, PfSUB-1 is a good candidate for this activity. This intriguing possibility clearly merits further investigation and is supported by molecular modeling of the proposed catalytic domain of PfSUB-1, which has indicated that a heptapeptide corresponding to the sequence flanking the MSP-1 secondary processing site (i.e.Gln-Gly-Met-Leu-Asn-Ile-Ser) fits well into the active site groove of the model, with the Leu-Asn scissile bond in the appropriate position for cleavage.3 The only other serine protease activity previously localized to P. falciparum merozoites is a DFP-reactive enzyme thought to be activated following cleavage of a GPI anchor (14Braun-Breton C. Rosenberry T.L. Pereira da Silva L. Nature. 1988; 332: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar); it is unlikely that PfSUB-1 corresponds to this activity, since it shows no DFP reactivity and the sequence exhibits no C-terminal hydrophobic domain typical of GPI signal sequences (66Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar).Of the two major families of active site serine endoproteases, the chymotrypsin-like and the subtilisin-like families (32Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), chymotrypsin-like proteases are common in higher eukaryotes but appear to be rare in lower eukaryotes and prokaryotic organisms. Sakanariet al. (67Sakanari J.A. Staunton C.E. Eakin A.E. Craik C.S. McKerrow J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4863-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) have reported evidence for the existence of a chymotrypsin-like gene in Trypanosoma cruzi, but there is no other previous genetic data on protozoal serine proteases. Extensive attempts in this laboratory to isolate chymotrypsin-like P. falciparum genes using a number of different PCR-based approaches have been unsuccessful.4 It is conceivable that, likeSaccharomyces cerevisiae (40The Yeast Genome Directory (1997) Nature 387, suppl., 1–105Google Scholar), the malaria parasite (and perhaps other apicomplexan parasites) does not possess genes of this class. Proteases play a crucial role in the life cycle of the blood stage malaria parasite and are undoubtedly potential targets for the design of protease inhibitor-based drugs. Expression of PfSUB-1 in an enzymatically active form should allow the development and evaluation of such inhibitors. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria, is an obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasite. The life cycle of the organism includes a number of specialized invasive (zoite) stages. In the vertebrate host, replication of the parasite in circulating erythrocytes is initiated when the cells are invaded by merozoites. The parasite replicates asexually within the infected erythrocyte to produce a number of progeny merozoites. Upon rupture of the host cell, these are released to invade fresh erythrocytes and perpetuate the blood stage cycle. Erythrocyte invasion by the malaria merozoite has been the subject of intensive study, since intervention strategies that prevent invasion would effectively block both replication of the parasite and the associated clinical disease. Electron microscopic studies have shown that erythrocyte invasion by the malaria merozoite takes place in a number of discrete stages. Initial reversible attachment of the parasite to the red cell surface is rapidly followed by reorientation, the formation of an irreversible junction between the apical prominence of the merozoite and the host cell surface, and finally entry of the parasite into the cell by a mechanism resembling a form of induced endocytosis (1Dvorak J.A.

The process is facilitated by the controlled release of the contents of three types of secretory organelles, called rhoptries, micronemes, and dense granules, situated at or toward the apical domain of the merozoite (2Bannister L.H. Butcher G.A. Dennis E.D. Mitchell G.H. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,5Bannister L.H. Mitchell G.H. Butcher G.A. Dennis E.D.

There is extensive evidence indicating an essential role for parasite-derived proteases in invasion. Invasion by P. falciparum merozoites is blocked in the presence of the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)1 (7Dejkriengkraikhul P. Wilairat P. Z. Parasitenkd. 1983; 69: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and invasion by merozoites of a number of Plasmodium species is prevented by chymostatin (8Dutta G.P. Banyal H.S. Indian J.

The inhibitory effect of chymostatin on invasion can be reversed by pretreatment of target erythrocytes with chymotrypsin (10Dluzewski A.R. Rangachari K. Wilson R.J.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1986; 62: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting that the chymostatin-sensitive step in invasion involves an essential, parasite-induced proteolytic modification of the red cell surface (10Dluzewski A.R.

Parasitol. 1993; 62: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored malarial serine protease activity has been described that may be involved in this modification (14Braun-Breton C. Rosenberry T.L. Pereira da Silva L. Nature. 1988; 332: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Treatment of isolated, invasive merozoites of the simian malariaP. knowlesi with N-tosyl phenylalanylchloromethyl ketone or N-tosyl lysylchloromethyl ketone prevents primary attachment of the parasites to host cells, whereas chymostatin blocks a later stage in the invasion pathway, indicating that more than one distinct protease activity may be involved (15Hadley T. Aikawa M. Miller L.H. Exp. Parasitol. 1983; 55: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, a P. falciparum serine protease activity that mediates an essential processing and shedding of a major merozoite surface protein (merozoite surface protein-1; MSP-1) at invasion is highly sensitive to inhibition by PMSF but not by chymostatin (16Blackman M.J. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 17Blackman M.J. Chappel J.A. Shai S. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Parasite proteases involved in invasion are attractive potential targets for new rational approaches to antimalarial chemotherapy. Here we report the identification of a novel, single copy P. falciparum gene (denoted pfsub-1) encoding a member of the subtilisin-like serine protease superfamily (subtilases). The primary gene product is expressed in the latter stages of intracellular merozoite maturation, and is post-translationally modified during secretory transport in a manner consistent with it being processed to form a mature, enzymatically active product. The putative mature protease is concentrated in a subset of dense granules within the apical domain of free merozoites and then is released in a soluble form during erythrocyte invasion, suggesting that it may play a role in invasion. This is the first molecular characterization of a putative apicomplexan serine protease. DISCUSSIONThis report describes the first gene to be identified of any apicomplexan parasite that encodes a serine protease-like protein. We have not directly demonstrated any pro"

Pulse-chase experiments showed that sMR production in culture occurred by constitutive cleavage of pre-existing full-length protein. A binding assay was developed to determine the sugar specificity of sMR and its ability to interact with pathogens and particulate antigens (i.e. Candida albicans and zymosan). Protease inhibitor studies suggested that sMR was produced by cleavage of an intact mannose receptor by a matrix metalloprotease or ADAM metalloprotease. A role for sMR in the immune response is proposed based on its binding properties, regulation by cytokines, and the previous discovery of putative ligands for the cysteine-rich domain of the mannose receptor in lymph nodes and spleen.

Using as a probe a chimeric protein containing the cysteine-rich domain of the MR fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 (CR-Fc), we found putative ligand(s) for this domain of the MR in marginal zone metallophilic and subcapsular sinus MØ in naive mice and in the germinal centers of immunized mice. CR-Fc+ cells with dendritic morphology migrated toward the follicular areas and paracortex of lymph nodes during a secondary immune response (23Martı́nez-Pomares L. Kosco-Vilbois M. Darley E. Tree P.

We hypothesized a role for a soluble form of the MR in the transport of sugar-bearing molecules and/or particles to sites of humoral immune responses. In this report, we demonstrate the existence of such a formin vitro and in vivo. sMR was readily detected in media from cultured primary MØ and was produced by constitutive cleavage of a pre-existing cellular form. A simple and rapid binding assay was developed to test the sugar specificity of sMR (d-mannose = l-fucose >d-galactose) and its ability to interact with particulate antigens (Candida albicans and zymosan) in a carbohydrate-dependent manner. sMR was also detected in mouse serum. Possible functions for sMR will be discussed. Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice were bred at the Dunn School of Pathology and used at 10–12 weeks of age. Murine IL-4 was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Murine IFN-γ was from Genzyme Diagnostics (Cambridge, MA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against purified murine mannose receptor (24Blum J.S. Stahl P.D. Diaz R. Fiani M.L. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 213: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was absorbed with thymocytes. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against the COOH end of the MR was obtained by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with the synthetic peptide NH2-SNLSPGTSDTKDLMGNIEQNEH-COOH (200 μg of peptide per immunization). LPS, zymosan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, d-mannose, l-fucose, d-galactose, mannan, p-aminophenyl α-d-mannosyl-agarose, and p-aminophenyl α-d-galactosyl-agarose were purchased from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, UK). Mannose-BSA (Man32-BSA, 32 mol of mannose/mol of bovine serum albumin) was purchased from EY Laboratories (San Mateo, CA). The protease inhibitorsN-[N-(l-3-trans-carboxirane-2-carbonyl)-l-leucyl]-agmatine (E-64, cysteine proteinase inhibitor), pepstatin (acid proteinase inhibitor), and α2-macroglobulin (broad spectrum proteinase inhibitor) were from Boehringer Mannheim (Lewes, UK). The matrix metalloprotease inhibitor BB 2116 was a kind gift of Dr. Andrew Gearing of British Biotech (Oxford, UK). Peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG was from Chemicon (Harrow, UK). Protein G-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Stock cultures of C. albicans (ATCC 18804) were prepared as described (25Maródi L. Korchak H.M. Johnston R.B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2783-2789PubMed Google Scholar). Bio-Gel-elicited peritoneal cells were collected by lavage 4 days after intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml of a 1% w/v suspension of Bio-Gel P100 polyacrylamide beads (Bio-Rad). MØs were enriched by adherence for 1–2 h in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured in Opti-MEM or RPMI supplemented with 2% FCS, 10 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (RPMI-2% FCS) in the absence or presence of different cytokines or stimuli. Cell supernatants were cleared at 2000 rpm for 5 min in a tabletop centrifuge and at 100,000 × g for 30 min, concentrated using Centricon 30 (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and stored at −20 °C. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in the dish with 2% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaN3, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μm leupeptin at 4 °C for 1 h, then harvested, and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min in a tabletop centrifuge to eliminate nuclei. Protein concentrations in cell lysates were determined by the BCA method (Pierce). Corresponding amounts of concentrated conditioned media and cell lysates were electrophoresed in 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose using standard methods. Blotted proteins were probed with rabbit anti-MR antibody and specific bands visualized using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Bucks, UK). 20 μl of concentrated conditioned media from MØ cultured in RPMI-2% FCS containing 10 ng/ml IL-4 or 10–50 μl of mouse serum were diluted in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mNaCl, 15 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100) to 400 μl and incubated with 20 μl of p-aminophenyl α-d-mannose-agarose or p-aminophenyl α-d-galactose-agarose in the absence or presence of different inhibitors for 2–16 h at 4 °C. Agarose beads were collected by centrifugation and washed 3 times with binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by incubating the beads with nonreducing loading buffer containing 25 mm EDTA, resolved on a 6% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. sMR was detected as described above. A modified version of this procedure was used to test the ability of sMR to bind particulate antigens (C. albicansor zymosan) by substituting the agarose beads with 2 × 107–108 particles/assay. 3 × 106 Bio-Gel-elicited MØ were plated in 35-mm dishes and cultured overnight in Opti-MEM or RPMI-2% FCS in the absence or presence of cytokines or LPS. For pulse-chase experiments, cells were incubated in 0.5 ml of labeling media (RPMI withoutl-methionine and l-cysteine, + 2% dialyzed FCS + 0.5 mCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN Biomedicals Ltd., Thame, UK)) for 2 h, and either supernatants and cells were processed immediately for immunoprecipitation or cells were washed in RPMI-2% FCS containing a 10-fold excess of l-methionine andl-cysteine and incubated further in 1 ml of the same media for different periods of time. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer for 1 h at 4 °C, harvested and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min in a tabletop centrifuge, and cleared at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants were cleared in the same way. 100 μl of cell lysate and 330 μl of supernatant were brought to a final volume of 500 μl with lysis buffer and precleared for 2 h with 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia). After preclearing, lysates and supernatants were incubated overnight with 2 μl of anti-MR antibody and 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C. After incubation, Sepharose beads were washed 3 times in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mmNaCl, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.05% (w/v) SDS; twice in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% (w/v) SDS; and once in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.05% (w/v) SDS. Proteins were eluted in nonreducing loading buffer, resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography. In some cases, immunoprecipitated cMR and sMR were quantified using PhosphorImager analysis. To examine the possible existence of a soluble form of the MR, cell lysates and supernatants from Bio-Gel-elicited peritoneal MØ were collected at different times and tested for the presence of MR. cMR and sMR were detected in protein lysates and conditioned media, respectively (Fig. 1). cMR was the expected size (175 kDa) (3Pontow S.E. Kery V. Stahl P.D. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137B: 221-244PubMed Google Scholar) and, as described previously (22Stein M.L. Keshav S. Harris N. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar), its accumulation was up-regulated by IL-4. This effect was further increased in the presence of FCS. sMR was detected after 24 h of culture and accumulated in the conditioned media. Only one form of sMR with slightly faster mobility than cMR was found. No release of another MØ-specific integral membrane protein, F4/80, was detected under these conditions (data not shown). sMR was not recognized by an antibody specific for the cytoplasmic tail of the MR (Fig. 2). This result suggests that sMR lacks this domain and could be produced by proteolytic cleavage of the cell-associated form of the receptor. sMR was stable, was not affected by freezing and thawing, and could be stored at −20 °C for long periods of time.Figure 2An antibody specific for the cytoplasmic tail of the MR does not recognize sMR. Cell lysate (7 μg,C) and concentrated supernatant (1, 2.5, and 5 μl,S) from Bio-Gel-elicited MØ cultured in RPMI-2% FCS in the presence of IL-4 (10 ng/ml) were analyzed by Western blot with polyclonal antibodies raised against purified murine MR (α-MR) or a synthetic peptide with part of the COOH-terminal sequence of murine MR, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (α-MR-COOH). The control panelshows results obtained with preimmune antibody. α-MR-COOH failed to recognize the soluble form of the MR found in the supernatant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The binding properties of sMR were characterized using a semiquantitative ligand Binding assay. sMR bound specifically to p-aminophenyl α-d-mannose-agarose, and this interaction was inhibited by EDTA. Binding of sMR to the beads was inhibited by millimolar concentrations of d-mannose and l-fucose but not by d-galactose (Fig. 3), in good agreement with the published specificity for MR:d-mannose = l-fucose >d-galactose (15Kery V. Krepinsky J.J.F. Warren C.D. Capek P. Stahl P.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As expected, mannan and mannose-BSA were much more potent inhibitors of sMR binding, with approximate IC50 values of 10 nm and 3 μg/ml, respectively (not shown). The same type of assay was used to test the ability of sMR to bind natural particulate antigens, i.e.heat-killed C. albicans or zymosan (Fig. 4). In both cases the interaction was inhibited by d-mannose and l-fucose (10 mm) but not by 10 mmd-galactose.Figure 4Binding of sMR to heat-killed Candida albicans and zymosan. Concentrated supernatant from MØ cultured in the presence of 2% FCS and IL-4 was incubated withp-aminophenyl α-d-mannose-agarose (Man-O), 2 × 107 zymosan particles, or 2 × 107 heat-killed C. albicans in the absence (−) or presence of d-mannose (10 mm),l-fucose (10 mm), or d-galactose (10 mm), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bound material was analyzed by Western blot using the anti-MR polyclonal antibody. sMR bound to heat-killed C. albicansand zymosan in a Ca2+- and mannose and fucose-dependent manner.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MR synthesis is regulated by MØ maturation, LPS (3Pontow S.E.

To characterize in more detail the relationship between cMR and sMR production, pulse-chase experiments were performed under different culture conditions, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 5 shows the effect of IL-4, IFN-γ, and LPS on cMR and sMR synthesis. After the pulse, two bands corresponding to the precursor and mature forms of cMR (3Pontow S.E. Kery V. Stahl P.D. Int. Rev.

No obvious difference in the rate of synthesis was observed in the case of IFN-γ under these conditions. sMR could already be detected in supernatants collected after a 2-h pulse in samples treated with IL-4. Analysis of samples collected after the 3-h chase showed the disappearance of the precursor form in the cell lysates (probably chased into the mature form of cMR) and the presence of sMR in the conditioned media from IL-4-treated cells. IFN-γ and LPS treatments seemed to reduce the half-life of the cellular receptor, although the reduction in the intensity of the bands could be because of the production of sMR, which is undetectable at this time point. After the 8-h chase, sMR could be detected in supernatants from control and IL-4- and IFN-γ-treated cells in amounts proportional to their rate of synthesis. This finding indicated that the production of sMR was constitutive and that the amount of sMR correlated with the amount of cMR present in the cell. No differences in sMR production were observed when IL-4 or IFN-γ was added only during the chase period (data not shown). As a first step toward characterization of the cleavage event that generates sMR, peritoneal MØs were pulsed with Tran35S-label followed by a chase in the presence of a variety of protease inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 6, the protease inhibitor BB 2116, a synthetic hydroxamic acid-based inhibitor of matrix metalloproteases (26Gearing A.J.H. Beckett P. Christodoulou M. Churchill M. Clements J. Davidson A.H. Drummond A.H. Galloway W.A. Gilbert R. Gordon J.L. Leber T.M. Mangan M. Miller K. Nayee P. Owen K. Patel S. Thomas W. Wells G. Wood L.M. Wooley K.

Commun. 1994; 199: 1442-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), blocked production of sMR in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC50 of approximately 3 μg/ml. The decrease in sMR production was unlikely to be caused by cell toxicity, because even at the highest concentration tested, 50 μg/ml, cell viability was greater than 95% by trypan blue staining. Other protease inhibitors tested were either ineffective or had modest and/or variable effects (Fig. 6). The detection of sMR in conditioned media from cultured peritoneal MØ might be considered an artifact of this in vitro system. For that reason, the presence of sMR in normal mouse serum was examined. A protein that reacted with the anti-MR polyclonal antibody and comigrated with sMR from MØ-conditioned media could be detected using just 0.5 μl of mouse serum (data not shown). This protein displayed sugar binding activity similar to the activity described above for sMR (Fig. 7). These findings indicate that sMR production occurs in vivo and that sMR is a component of normal mouse serum. sMR levels in mouse serum were not affected byMycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin orC. albicans infection, or by intraperitoneal treatment with LPS, zymosan, or heat-killed C. albicans (data not shown). In this study we demonstrate that there is a functional soluble form of murine MR produced by MØ in vitro and present in mouse serum. sMR migrated faster than cMR on SDS-PAGE, presumably because of cleavage of the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail (see Fig. 2), and was produced by cleavage of a pre-existing full-size cMR (Fig. 5). No sMR was found in cell lysates. sMR could be stored at −20 °C for long periods of time with no obvious change in mobility on SDS-PAGE or in sugar binding ability. The production of a single species of sMR is consistent with specific cleavage of cMR to produce a functional soluble form. sMR was able to interact with carbohydrates in a mannose- and fucose-dependent manner (Figs. 3 and 4). These results agreed with previous studies of sugar specificity of purified human MR (15Kery V. Krepinsky J.J.F. Warren C.D. Capek P. Stahl P.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) or complete and truncated forms of the human receptor expressed in vitro (18Taylor M.E. Bezouska K. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1719-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assays developed here allow the direct study of sMR interactions with a wide range of pathogens in a cell-free system. We showed that sMR interacted with heat-killed C. albicans and zymosan (prepared from theS. cerevisiae cell wall) in the same way as it boundp-aminophenyl α-d-mannosyl-agarose. Phagocytosis of unopsonized C. albicans by MØ has been shown to be mediated, to a considerable extent, by the MR; mannan and mannose-BSA inhibited 80% of C. albicans uptake by human monocyte-derived MØ (25Maródi L. Korchak H.M. Johnston R.B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2783-2789PubMed Google Scholar) and murine peritoneal MØ. 2R. Káposzta, unpublished results. The inhibition of sMR production by the matrix metalloprotease inhibitor BB 2116 strongly suggests a role for a metalloprotease in the release of sMR from the membrane. The matrix metalloproteases are a large family of extracellular zinc proteases, at least 18 distinct members of which have been discovered (28Sternlicht M. Werb Z. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Extracellular Matrix and Adhesion Proteins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998Google Scholar). A growing number of integral membrane proteins in the immune system have been shown to be released from cells by the action of metalloproteases, including tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (26Gearing A.J.H.

Guidebook to the Extracellular Matrix and Adhesion Proteins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998Google Scholar). Because BB 2116 can also inhibit TNFα release (26Gearing A.J.H. Beckett P. Christodoulou M. Churchill M. Clements J. Davidson A.H. Drummond A.H. Galloway W.A. Gilbert R. Gordon J.L. Leber T.M. Mangan M. Miller K. Nayee P. Owen K. Patel S. Thomas W. Wells G. Wood L.M. Wooley K. Nature. 1994; 370: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar), the sMR releasing activity may be either a matrix metalloprotease or an ADAM family metalloprotease. Further studies with specific inhibitors should help to answer this question. Unlike cMR synthesis, sMR production per se was not regulated by cytokines (IFN-γ and IL-4), but because the amount of sMR in conditioned media of cytokine-treated cells was directly related to the amount of cMR present in the cell, the total amount of sMR was effectively cytokine-regulated and followed the pattern described for cMR (6Harris N. Super M. Rits M. Chang G. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Blood. 1992; 80: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Stein M.L. Keshav S. Harris N. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). It should be noted that IFN-γ- (Fig. 5) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced down-regulation of MR (data not shown) could not be explained by increased cMR processing. Therefore, at least in these cases, sMR production was not a mechanism of down-modulation of MR activity as described for other leukocyte surface molecules (37Bazil V. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1567-1574PubMed Google Scholar,38Bazil V. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized lectins in serum is the mannose binding protein (MBP) (39Turner M.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), a C-type lectin with specificity for mannose and N-acetylglucosamine. Major differences between the MBP and sMR are suggestive of complementary roles in their interaction with mannosylated antigens. (i) In the case of MBP, 32-kDa monomers, each containing one CRD, form clusters to achieve high affinity binding, but a single sMR molecule binds to sugar with high affinity because of the presence of eight CRDs in tandem (19Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, just CRDs 4–8 are sufficient for this interaction (18Taylor M.E. Bezouska K. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1719-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). sMR might be forming complexes in serum, but they would not be necessary for its binding to glycoconjugates. (ii) MBP, a moderate acute-phase reactant, is increased, for example, after surgery or malarial infection. No modulation of sMR levels in serum has yet been found. (iii) MBP can activate the classical pathway of complement and act as an opsonin; MBP-pathogen complexes could be cleared through the interaction of the collagen region of MBP with collectin receptors expressed by most phagocytic cells. Ligand(s) for the cysteine-rich domain of the MR has been found on marginal zone metallophilic MØ in spleen, subcapsular sinus MØ in lymph nodes, germinal centers (specific cell type unknown), and a population of cells with dendritic morphology that migrate into the follicles during an immune response (CR-Fc+ cells) (23Martı́nez-Pomares L. Kosco-Vilbois M. Darley E. Tree P. Herren S. Bonnefoy J.-Y. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1927-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). sMR could interact with whole infectious agents (i.e. C. albicans) or cleavage products released after phagocytosis through the CRDs and with ligand(s) present on the cells described previously through the cysteine-rich domain. In this way, sMR-bound antigens would not be targeted for clearance but delivered, in their native form, to the CR-Fc+ cells surrounding the white pulp of the spleen or follicular regions in lymph nodes. Accordingly, sMR levels were increased in the presence of IL-4, a Th2 cytokine. We propose that mannosylated antigen opsonized by the MBP could also be targeted to these areas because of the presence of complement receptors on dendritic cells and follicular dendritic cells. Complement activity is necessary for the follicular localization of T-independent type-2 antigen (40Van den Eertwegh A.J.M. Laman J.D. Schellekens M.M. Boersma W.J.A. Claassen E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and in secondary lymphoid follicles, trapping of immune complexes by follicular dendritic cells was mediated by complement receptors 1 and 2 (41Yoshida K. Van den Berg T.K. Dijkstra C.D. Immunology. 1993; 80: 34-39PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a liver-specific form of the MR was identified as responsible for the clearance of the glycoprotein hormone lutropin through the recognition of the sulfated carbohydrate structure SO4-4-GalNacβ1,4Glc-NAcβ1,2Manα (42Fiete D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14629-14637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 43Fiete D. Beranek M.C. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11256-11261Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The binding site has been localized to the cysteine-rich domain of the receptor (44Fiete D.J. Beranek M.C. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2089-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possible competition of lutropin with the cysteine-rich domain ligands found in lymphoid organs should be considered. The tissue specificity of this recognition and the heterogeneity in binding properties found for recombinant MR expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (43Fiete D. Beranek M.C. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11256-11261Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) suggest that post-translational modifications could alter the binding properties of the cysteine-rich domain and determine the ability of MR to bind lutropin. In the case of sMR, no data are yet available regarding its cellular origin in vivo (e.g. hepatic endothelium versus MØ) or its ability to interact with lutropin. The MR has been implicated in the uptake of mannosylated antigens and their delivery to different intracellular compartments for their presentation in association with major histocompatibility complex class II in the case of peptides (4Sallusto F. Cella M. Danielli C. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar) or CD1 in the case of nonpeptides (16Prigozy T.I. Sieling P.A. Clemens D.

We propose a possible third mechanism of presentation of glycoconjugates: in their native form bound to sMR and attached to the cysteine-rich domain ligand(s) expressed by specialized antigen-bearing cells."

We therefore investigated the cisplatin effect on ERCC-1mRNA expression in vitro. In response to a 1-h cisplatin exposure, A2780/CP70 human ovarian cancer cells showed a 6-fold increase in steady-state level of ERCC-1 mRNA. This rise was attributable to increased transcription as measured by nuclear run-on assays and a 60% increase in ERCC-1mRNA half-life. The increase in ERCC-1 mRNA was preceded by a 4–5-fold rise in mRNA expressions of c-fos and c-jun, a 14-fold increase in c-Jun protein phosphorylation, and an increase in in vitronuclear extract binding activity to the AP-1-like site of ERCC-1. These data suggest that the induction of ERCC-1 expression in A2780/CP70 cells exposed to cisplatin results from two major factors: (a) an increase in the expression of transactivating factors that bind the AP-1-like site in the 5′-flanking region of ERCC-1 and (b) an increase in the level of c-Jun phosphorylation that enhances its transactivation property.

Invest. 1994; 94: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In contrast, the levels of expression of ERCC-1 in cisplatin hypersensitive, repair-deficient cells are 50- to 30-fold lower than in inherently resistant cells (26Taverna P. Hansson J. Scanlon K.J. Hill B.T. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2053-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The 414-bp sequence in the 5′-flanking region of the ERCC-1gene has been studied in detail by Hoeijmakers and colleagues (27van Duin M. deWit J. Odijk H. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Bootsma D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9195-9213Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), who have shown that constructs of this region may drive transcription of ERCC-1. Classical promoter elements like CAAT, TATA, and GC boxes are absent from the −1 to −170-bp portion of this region (28van Duin M. Koken M.H.M. van den Tol J. Odijk H. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9195-9213Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), although an AP-1-like site exists further upstream (Fig. 1). We have previously demonstrated that there are elevated levels of ERCC-1 mRNA in ovarian cancer tissues of patients clinically resistant to platinum compounds (25Dabholkar M. Vionnet J. Bostick-Bruton F. Yu J.J. Reed E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). However, the fundamental molecular basis of transcriptional activation and regulation of ERCC-1 expression is not well elucidated. The AP-1 (activator protein 1) family is a group of transcription factors responsible for the activation of a wide variety of genes in different cell types and tissues (29Cooper G.M. Oncogenes. 2nd Ed. Jones and Bartlett Publishers, Boston, MA1995Google Scholar, 30Abate C. Luk D. Curran T. Mol. Cell.

Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 67-93Google Scholar). The AP-1 transcription factor consists of either heterodimers formed between Jun and Fos family members of proto-oncoproteins or homodimers of Jun proteins (29Cooper G.M. Oncogenes. 2nd Ed. Jones and Bartlett Publishers, Boston, MA1995Google Scholar, 30Abate C. Luk D. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3624-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 31Gottlicher M. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Papavassiliou A.G. Transcription Factors in Eukaryotes. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 67-93Google Scholar). AP-1-binding sites (5′-TGAGTCA-3′) are frequently found in promoters or enhancers of genes that are inducible by a wide range of extracellular signals. Evidence showed that cisplatin induced expression of proto-oncogenes c-fos/c-jun (32Kashani-Sabet M. Wang W. Scanlon K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11285-11288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,33Rabo Y.B. Shoshan M.C. Linder S. Hansson J. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 65: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and activated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) (34Potapova O. Haghighi A. Bost F. Liu C.

JNK/SAPK is a subfamily of MAP kinases in the Ras pathway which is responsible for the phosphorylation of Jun protein. Phosphorylation of the c-Jun at serine residues 63 and 73 in its NH2-terminal domain greatly enhances the transcriptional activity of the AP-1-binding sites (36Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D.A.

Therefore, it is possible that the effect of cisplatin on ERCC-1 could be through AP-1 induction or c-Jun phosphorylation. Because methodological problems would limit investigations of mechanism in ovarian cancer tissues taken from patients, we have now conducted studies in the human ovarian cancer cell line, A2780/CP70, to investigate these possibilities. The human ovarian cancer cell line A2780/CP70 has been described previously (42Behrens B.C. Hamilton T.C. Masuda H. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 414-418PubMed Google Scholar) and were used in all experiments. Cells were cultured in monolayer using RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 0.2 units/ml human insulin, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Cells were grown in logarithmic growth at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2, 95% air. Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasmal infection using a commercial assay system (MycoTect; Life Technologies, Inc.), and new cultures were established monthly from frozen stocks. All media and reagents contained <0.1 ng/ml endotoxin as determined by Limulus polyphemus amebocyte lysate assay (Whittaker Bioproducts, Walkersville, MD). Cell viability was determined in triplicate by trypan blue dye exclusion. Before starting the experiments, the cells were grown to ∼90% confluence after subculturing. Cisplatin (Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) was initially dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ or Mg2+at 1.0 mg/ml (3.33 mm cisplatin), and dilutions from this solution were made in media to obtain the desired drug treatment concentrations. The cisplatin dose for A2780/CP70 cells was 40 to 80 μm unless otherwise indicated. Cisplatin treatments were for 1 h. After drug treatments, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ or Mg2+, given fresh drug-free media, and incubated for 24 to 48 h or the time indicated. Thereafter, the cells were harvested for use in the RNA and protein isolation assays. α-Amanitin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and cycloheximide (Calbiochem) were dissolved in water. Cisplatin cytotoxicity was determined using the microculture tetrazolium assay, as described previously (43Lee K.B. Parker R.J. Reed E. Cancer Lett. 1995; 88: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The concentrations of other drugs used in the studies were not toxic to the cells as confirmed by cell recoveries, trypan blue dye exclusion, and cytotoxicity assay. Total RNA was isolated from cells by acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction (44Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63169) Google Scholar), or using a commercial total RNA isolation reagent kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thirty micrograms of denatured RNA per lane were separated by electrophoresis (Life Technologies, Inc.) through 1% agarose-formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membrane (Zeta-Probe GT; Bio-Rad) by electrophoretic transfer (Trans-Blot Cell; Bio-Rad). Membranes were prehybridized in Quik-Hyb (Stratagene, Menasha, WI) for 15–30 min at 68 °C and then hybridized for 1 to 2 h at 68 °C in Quik-Hyb containing 0.67 μg/ml denatured salmon testes DNA (Stratagene) and 32P-labeled cDNA probe. After washings of increasing stringency, the membranes were air dried, exposed to Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film with intensifying screens at −80 °C, and then analyzed by Collage Analysis (Fotodyne Inc., New Berlin, WI) and quantitated by densitometrical scanning. Before hybridization with a second labeled cDNA probe, the first probe was removed by washing for 2 h at 75 °C in 1 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.1 × Denhardt's solution (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The entire sequence of experiments (including growth of A2780/CP70 cells, drug treatment, and Northern blotting and hybridization) was performed and the results reproduced in two or more separate experiments. Equal RNA loading was determined by visualization of 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA bands in ethidium bromide-stained gels and quantification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) housekeeping gene transcript on Northern blots. A 1.05-kilobase cDNA probe for human ERCC-1 was obtained from Dr. Aziz Sancar (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). A 0.8-kilobase cDNA for human GAPDH was obtained from Dr. Mitchell Olman (University of California, San Diego, CA). The c-fos and a c-jun probes were obtained commercially from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). cDNA inserts were excised using appropriate restriction enzymes, isolated by electrophoresis through 1% agarose onto DEAE-membrane (NA-45; Schleicher & Scheull) (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and purified by using the GeneClean II Kit (BIO 101 Inc., La Jolla, CA). cDNA was labeled with 32P using a commercial random primer kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ERCC-1transcription rate was measured using a modification of previously described nuclear run-on analysis (46Raj N.B.K. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3923-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A2780/CP70 cells grown to ∼90% confluence were lysed in 10 ml of lysis buffer, containing 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.25% Triton X-100, 0.3 m sucrose, and 1 mmdithiothreitol, and nuclei were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g. Isolated nuclei were incubated with 250 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (NEN Life Science Products, Wilmington, DE) for 30 min at 37 °C. cDNA for ERCC-1and GAPDH, or vector DNA (the plasmid without ERCC-1cDNA insert) (5 μg of DNA per blot) used in the run-on assay was heat denatured and transferred to supported nitrocellulose (Life Technologies, Inc.) by vacuum filtration using a 24-well manifold (Hybri-Dot; Life Technologies, Inc.). The membrane was rinsed with 6 × sodium chloride-sodium citrate (SSC), air dried, and baked at 80 °C for 2 h in a vacuum oven. Membranes were prehybridized for 1 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon testes DNA and then hybridized at 42 °C for 3 days in prehybridization buffer containing run-on reaction mixtures adjusted to equalize radioactivity added in all reactions. Membranes were extensively washed with increasing stringency and then treated with 1 μg/ml ribonuclease for 30 min at 37 °C. Membranes were air dried, exposed to XAR-5 film, and quantitation of the results was achieved by densitometric scanning normalized to the signal for GAPDH. A standard technique for measuring stability of labile transcripts was used (47Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 475-493Crossref Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with fresh drug-free medium for 36 h following treatment with 40 μm cisplatin for 1 h or left without treatment as control, after which α-amanitin (5 μg/ml) or actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) was added to the treated and control flasks. Total RNA was isolated at the time of α-amanitin or actinomycin D addition or at different times thereafter. Northern blot analysis was performed to determine mRNA levels. To prepare whole cell lysates, 2 × 107cells were washed 3 times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 500 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstain, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride at 4 °C. Lysates were sheared through a 21-gauge needle and clarified at 4 °C by microcentrifugation. Protein content in the supernatants was determined by means of the BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The cell extract proteins (25 μg) were loaded on a 12% Tris glycine gel (Novex, San Diego, CA), electrophoresed, and transblotted to a Protran (pure nitrocellulose) membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) by the procedure described by Towbin et al. (48Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44915) Google Scholar). The blot was then rinsed with TBS, and incubated with a blocking buffer (1 × TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) overnight at 4 °C. After rinsing with TBS/Tween (0.1%) three times, the blot was incubated with phosho-c-Jun (Ser63 and Ser73) antibodies (1:1,000 in TBS/Tween with milk) overnight at 4 °C on a shaker. The blot was washed three times with TBS/Tween, and incubated with a 1:2,000 dilution of secondary antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase for 2 h at room temperature on a shaker. The blot was washed three times with TBS/Tween and then incubated with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham) for 1 min at room temperature. The blot was exposed to x-ray film to visualize the results. Nuclear extracts were prepared from resting or cisplatin-treated A2780/CP70 cells by a modification of the procedure described by Dignam et al.(49Dignam J.P. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9155) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by scrapping and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then resuspended in 1.5 volumes of lysis buffer (70 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.4 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). The mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min and then extracted by adding 1.6 volumes of extraction buffer (0.5 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1.66 m KCl, 0.4 mm sodium fluoride, 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 mm1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) with constant shaking at 4 °C for 4 h. Samples were centrifuged at 55,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was dialyzed at 4 °C for 4 h in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.4 mm sodium fluoride, 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were stored at −80 °C. Protein content was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). The oligonucleotide sequence used in the following electrophoretic mobility shift assay was based on sequence analysis of the 5′-flanking region of ERCC-1 gene as described previously (28van Duin M. Koken M.H.M. van den Tol J. Odijk H. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9195-9213Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Two duplex 21-bp oligonucleotides which encompassed a ERCC-1 AP-1-like site (5′-TCACTGCTGTGTCACCAGCAC-3−, within −355 to −375 from the transcriptional start site at +1 in theERCC-1 promoter region) (see Fig. 1) and an alteredERCC-1 AP-1-like site (5′-TCACTGCTGAGTCACCAGCAC-3−, −355 to −375) were synthesized by Lofstrand Labs Limited (Gaithersburg, MD) and purified by reverse-phase cartridge chromatography. The alteredERCC-1 AP-1-like site contains a concensus AP-1 site produced by a 1-bp substitution from thymidine to adenosine as indicated by the underline. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [α-32P]ATP by phosphorylation with bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase and unincorporated precursors were removed using G-25 Sephadex columns (Boehringer Mannheim). 21-bp oligonucleotides that contained the accepted consensus sequence for AP-1, AP-2, CREB, TFIID, and NFκB were obtained from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI) and used in binding or competition studies described below. The nuclear extracts were analyzed for transcription factor binding activity by gel mobility shift assays. Briefly, nuclear extracts were incubated in a 20-μl volume with 1 × binding buffer (1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane, 50 mm NaCl, 4% glycerol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) at room temperature for 10 min. The 32P-labeled target DNA was then added and the mixture was incubated for 20–30 min at room temperature. In some experiments, a 50-fold concentration of unlabeled competitor DNA was included in the sample prior to the addition of the radiolabeled probe. After the completion of the binding reaction, 2 μl of 10 × gel loading buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 0.2% xylene cyanol, and 40% glycerol) was added and samples were electrophoresed at room temperature through a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE running buffer (0.045 m Tris borate, 0.001 m EDTA, pH 8.0) for 4 h at 100 V which had been pre-run at 100 V for 30 min prior the sample loading. The gels were dried under vacuum and visualized by autoradiography. The nuclear extracts were preincubated with antiserum at room temperature for 20–30 min before analysis by EMSA as described above. The human anti-Fos and anti-AP-2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); the affinity purified human anti-Jun antibody has been previously described (50Powers C. Krutzsch H. Gardner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30089-30095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These sera specifically detect the presence of the corresponding transcription factor and do not interfere with nuclear factor binding. The A2780/CP70 cell line was treated with 40 μm cisplatin for 1 h, and the expression of ERCC-1 mRNA was measured at various time points following drug exposure. Cisplatin caused time and dose-dependent increases in ERCC-1 mRNA levels (51Li Q. Tsang B. Dabholkar M. Bostick-Bruton F. Reed E. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1998; 39: 241Google Scholar). Northern analysis showed that ERCC-1 mRNA accumulation was increased by more than 2-fold as early as 6 h after incubation with 40 μm cisplatin and eventually attained a peak level of 5.5-fold increase at 24–48 h after cisplatin administration. Dose-response experiments showed that the effect of cisplatin was maximal at 40–80 μm with about a 6-fold increase in the ERCC-1 mRNA level. The ERCC-1increase was"

By expressing the intracellular domain of Flt-1/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 in the baculosystem, we identified two major tyrosine phosphorylation sites at Tyr-1213 and Tyr-1242 and two minor tyrosine phosphorylation sites at Tyr-1327 and Tyr-1333 in this receptor. This pattern of phosphorylation of Flt-1 was also detected in vascular endothelial growth factor-stimulated cells expressing intact Flt-1. In vitroprotein binding studies using synthetic peptides and immunoblotting showed that phospholipase C-γ binds to both Y(p)1213 and Y(p)1333, whereas Grb2 and SH2-containing tyrosine protein phosphatase (SHP-2) bind to Y(p)1213, and Nck and Crk bind to Y(p)1333 in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. In addition, unidentified proteins with molecular masses around 74 and 27 kDa bound to Y(p)1213 and another of 75 kDa bound to Y(p)1333 in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. SHP-2, phospholipase C-γ, and Grb2 could also be shown to bind to the intact Flt-1 intracellular domain.

Receptor tyrosine kinases comprise a large family of transmembrane receptors for polypeptide growth factors (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). Binding of the growth factor to its specific receptor triggers activation of the intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase activity. It further provokes autophosphorylation of the receptors and tyrosine phosphorylation of various intracellular signaling molecules leading to signal transduction to downstream effector molecules (2Anderson D. Koch C.A. Grey L. Ellis C. Moran M.F. Pawson T. Science. 1990; 250: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the receptors provides high affinity binding sites for a variety of Src homology 2 (SH2)1 domain-containing proteins (3Cantley L.C. Auger K.R.

Pawson T Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). The binding of a particular SH2 domain to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins is dependent on the primary sequence surrounding the phosphotyrosine. Certain SH2 domain-containing proteins such as phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and GTPase-activating protein possess enzymatic activities, whereas other SH2 domain molecules, i.e. adaptors like Grb2, Crk, and Nck, lack intrinsic enzymatic activities. Adaptors are believed to transduce signals by mediating protein-protein interactions with other signaling molecules such as the guanine nucleotide exchanging factor, Sos (5Birge R.B. Knudsen B.S. Besser D. Hanafusa H. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 595-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Several SH2 domain-containing proteins may converge on the same signal transduction pathway; Grb2, Crk, and Nck has been shown to be involved in Ras activation through binding to the same target Sos. On the other hand, however, it has also been shown that these SH2 domain-containing molecules bind to a variety of other intracellular proteins and seem to be involved in multiple signaling pathways (5Birge R.B.

They consist of seven immunoglobulin-like loops in the extracellular part, a transmembrane domain, a juxtamembrane domain, a kinase domain interrupted by a 69-amino acid residue long insert, and a C-terminal tail. Recently, several novel VEGF-related polypeptides have been identified and denoted VEGF-B (18Olofsson B. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. von Euler G. Joukov V. Saksela O. Orpana A. Pettersson R. Alitalo K.

Although these proteins share about 30–53% homology in their primary sequences, they show distinct patterns of binding to the three known VEGF receptors; VEGF-B and -C bind to KDR/Flk-1, whereas placenta growth factor binds to Flt-1 with lower affinity than VEGF (22Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25646-25654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, VEGF-C binds with high affinity to Flt-4 (VEGFR-3) which is expressed on lymphatic endothelium (19Joukov V. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. Chilov D. Lahtinen I. Kukk E. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N.

VEGF receptor expression is seen in various tissues of adult rats, and relatively high expression has been identified during embryogenesis, indicating their very important roles for embryonal development (13Peters K.G. de Vries C. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8915-8919Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Gene-targeting studies show that both of Flt-1 and KDR/Flk-1 knock-out mice die in utero by embryonic day 9.5 (23Fong G.-H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar, 24Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.-F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar). Analysis of these knock-out mice revealed an absence of yolk sac-derived blood islands and hematopoietic progenitor cells in KDR/Flk-1 null mice and disorganization of vessels in Flt-1 null mice. These data suggest that the receptors have different biological functions and indicate that Flt-1 and KDR/Flk-1 utilize different signal transduction pathways. By stimulating KDR/Flk-1-transfected PAE cells and NIH3T3 fibroblasts with VEGF, KDR/Flk-1 has been shown to autophosphorylate (8Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.- H.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and four in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation sites, Tyr-951, Tyr-996, Tyr-1054, and Tyr-1059, have been identified by bacterially expressing the cytosolic domain of KDR/Flk-1 (26Dougher-Vermazen M. Hulmes J.D. Böhlen P. Terman B.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 728-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about signal transduction molecules involved in Flt-1 signaling. In this report, we aimed to identify the tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Flt-1 by expressing the intracellular (IC) domain of human Flt-1 in the baculosystem and to identify signal transduction molecules binding to these sites. Sf9 insect cells (PharMingen) were maintained in Grace's insect medium (Sigma) supplemented with lactalbumin hydrolysate, yeastolate, and 10% fetal calf serum at 27 °C. An endothelial cell line (MS1; kind gift of J. Arbiser, Department of Surgery, Children's Hospital, Boston) (27Arbiser J.L. Moses M.A. Fernandez C.A. Ghiso N. Cao Y. Klauber N. Frank D. Brownlee M. Flynn E. Parangi S. Byers H.R. Folkman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) derived from mouse pancreas and immortalized through expression of a temperature-sensitive simian virus large T oncogene was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum under the atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. APflMI-XbaI fragment encoding the intracellular domain (IC) of the human flt-1 cDNA (nucleotides 4961–6524) was subcloned into a baculovirus transfer vector (pVL1393; PharMingen) at a BamHI-XbaI site by use of aBamHI (5′) and PflMI (3′) double-stranded adaptor containing a starting codon downstream of the BamHI site (5′-GATCCATGCATCACCATCACCATCACGCCAGCAA-3′). This IC region contains 20 of 22 tyrosine residues in the Flt-1 IC; Tyr-794 and Tyr-815 in the juxta-membrane region are not included in this construct. The transfer vector containing h-flt-1 IC cDNA was transfected into Sf9 cells using a BaculoGoldTM transfection kit (PharMingen). The conditioned medium containing recombinant baculovirus carrying the h-flt-1 IC cDNA was used for amplification to obtain high titer virus solution. For substitution of tyrosine residues to phenylalanine, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on a fragment cDNA of h-flt-1 using the Altered Sitesin vitro Mutagenesis System (Promega Corp.). The following oligonucleotides were used for mutagenesis: 5′-CTGCAAATTTGGAAATC-3′ (Y914F); 5′-TGTCAGATTTGTAAATGC-3′ (Y1213F); 5′-TGATGACTTCCAGGGCG-3′ (Y1242F); 5′-CCCAGACTTCAACTCGGT-3′ (Y1327F); and 5′-TGGTCCTGTTCTCCACC-3′ (Y1333F). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutated flt-1 receptors were subcloned into pVL1393 and transfected into Sf9 cells to yield recombinant viruses carrying mutant receptors. The rabbit anti-Flt-1 antibody, raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 1312–1328 in the C terminus of human Flt-1, anti-SHP-2, anti-Grb2, and anti-Nck antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. The monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20), anti-Crk, and anti-p85 antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. The rabbit anti-PLC-γ antiserum was raised against human PLC-γ and was kindly provided by Dr. Lars Rönnstrand, the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden. Peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulins were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cell lysate was incubated with specific antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C and further incubated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing the beads, the immunocomplex was separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to Hybond-C extra membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The filter was then blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C overnight, and probed with specific antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the filter was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, and reactions were visualized through enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Insect cells (1 × 107) were infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying h-flt-1 IC for 3 days. After washing with ice-cold TBS, cells were lysed with high salt lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm EDTA, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). After centrifugation, the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies against Flt-1 or PY20 on ice for 2 h. The immunocomplex was collected with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, washed with high salt lysis buffer, and resuspended in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol). In vitrophosphorylation was carried out in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by addition of 2× sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol). The boiled samples were electrophoresed on SDS-containing gradient acrylamide gels (7.5–12%) and transferred to nitrocellulose. After exposure to film, bands corresponding to Flt-1 IC were excised from the filter and digested with trypsin (modified sequencing grade; Promega) or Asp-N (Boehringer Mannheim) for 12 h at 37 °C as described (28Aebersold R.H. Leavitt J. Saavedra R.A. Hood L.E. Kent S.B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6970-6974Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was performed using the Hunter thin layer electrophoresis apparatus (HTLE-7000; C.B.S. Scientific Co., Inc., Del Mar, CA) according to Boyle et al. (29Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). First dimension electrophoresis was performed in pH 1.9 buffer (formic acid:glacial acetic acid:double-distilled water, 46:156:1798, v/v) for 40 min at 2000 V, and the second dimension ascending thin layer chromatography was run in isobutyric acid buffer (isobutyric acid:n-butyl alcohol:pyridine:glacial acetic acid:double-distilled water, 1250:38:96:58:558, v/v). After exposure on a Bio-Imaging Analyzer screen (Fuji), radioactive phosphopeptides on the thin layer plates were scraped off and then eluted in pH 1.9 buffer or 30% formic acid and lyophilized. The fractions were subjected to two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis and, in parallel, Edman degradation. For Edman degradation, phosphopeptides were coupled to Sequelon-AA membranes (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems Gas Phase Sequencer. The activity in released phenylthiohydantoin derivatives from each cycle was quantitated by use of the Bio-Imaging Analyzer. The eluted peptides were hydrolyzed in 6 m hydrochloric acid for 1 h at 110 °C. After lyophilization, the peptides were dissolved in pH 1.9 buffer containing phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, and phosphothreonine as markers and separated on a cellulose plate at pH 1.9 in the first dimension and at pH 3.5 in the second dimension. After visualization of the markers by ninhydrin (BDH Laboratory Supplies) spraying, the plate was exposed to film. The following peptides with or without phosphorylation on tyrosine were synthesized: Ac-KKKDVRY1213VNAFKF (designated as Y(p)1213 with phosphotyrosine and 1213Ref without phosphotyrosine); Ac-MFDDY1242QGDSSTLLA (designated as Y(p)1242 and 1242Ref, respectively); NH2-KKKPPPDY1327NSVVLY1333STPPI (designated as Y(pp)1327/1333 with double phosphorylation, Y(p)1333 with single phosphorylation, and 1333Ref without phosphorylation). The underlined sequence KKK was added to the N terminus of the indicated peptides to increase their coupling efficiency to the support, as well as solubility, in buffer solution. The peptides encompassing Tyr-1213 and Tyr-1327/1333 were immobilized on Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) and those encompassing Tyr-1242 on Affi-Gel 15. After incubation with a mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine at 100 μCi/ml (Promix, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 h at 37 °C, MS1 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, 5 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mmNa3VO4). The cell lysate was precleared to reduce nonspecific binding by incubating with non-immune serum-coupled agarose gel for 30 min. The resulting cell lysate was then incubated with immobilized reference peptide or phosphorylated peptide in the presence or absence of blocking peptide for 1 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. After washing the gel, binding proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by fixation in destain (7% acetic acid and 10% methanol) for 30 min and incubation in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min and visualized by exposing on films. Wild-type and mutants receptors, Y1213F, Y1242F, and Y1333F, were expressed in Sf9 cells. After cell lysis, the receptors were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flt-1 antibody and collected by use of immobilized protein A (Immunosorb; EC Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden). The beads were incubated with MS1 cell lysate for 1 h at 4 °C. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting using specific antibodies. Sf9 cells infected with recombinant virus carrying the h-flt-1 intracellular (IC) domain cDNA express a 60-kDa protein corresponding to Flt-1 IC (Fig. 1 A). The protein is detected in the cell lysate but not in the conditioned medium. Immunoprecipitation of the cell lysate with anti-Flt-1 antibody followed by immunoblotting with the monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 demonstrates tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein (Fig. 1 B), indicating that the receptor tyrosine kinase is activated leading to autophosphorylation of the receptor. Immune complex kinase assays on immunoprecipitates using PY20 or anti-Flt-1 antibody also demonstrate strong autophosphorylation of the Flt-1 IC (Fig. 1 C). This is in agreement with previous reports on expression of the IC domains of EGFR and FGFR-1, respectively, in insect cells, which both were shown to be active kinases (30Hsu C.-Y.J. Mohammadi M. Nathan M. Honegger A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Hurwitz D.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 191-200PubMed Google Scholar, 31Mohammadi M. Dikic I. Sorokin A. Burgess W.H. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Moreover, the pattern of autophosphorylation of the insect cell-derived EGFR and FGFR-1 IC was shown to correspond exactly to in vivo phosphorylated intact receptors. To investigate tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Flt-1, the 60-kDa protein corresponding to Flt-1 IC was labeled with 32P through an immune complex kinase assay as shown in Fig. 1 C. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer to a membrane, the 60-kDa band was excised, digested with trypsin, and subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. Fig. 2 shows a two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of the Flt-1 IC which was immunoprecipitated with the anti-Flt-1 antibody prior to the immune complex kinase assay. The immunoprecipitated material was separated by thin layer electrophoresis at pH 1.9 and chromatography. Several spots appeared to theright of the application spot (Δ) in the two-dimensional maps, after infection of the Sf9 cells with the Flt-1 IC virus (Fig. 2), indicating that these Flt-1-derived spots have neutral or positive charges at pH 1.9. Two spots (a and b) showed strong signals, whereas other spots such as c were fainter. This pattern was quite similar to that obtained after immunoprecipitation with PY20 (data not shown). Each spot was scraped from the plate to elute the tryptic peptides, followed by phosphoamino acid analysis. Fig. 3 (insets) shows that the peptides from spots a and bcontain phosphotyrosine but not phosphoserine nor phosphothreonine. Spot c contains both phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine, whereas other fainter spots contain phosphoserine or phosphothreonine but not phosphotyrosine. Tryptic peptides eluted from spots a, b, and c were subjected to Edman degradation.Figure 3Edman degradation and phosphoamino acid analysis of trypsin-digested Flt-1 IC. Radioactive peptide fragments were eluted from each spot on the two-dimensional map (Fig. 2). A part of each sample was hydrolyzed in 6 mhydrochloric acid for 1 h at 110 °C and separated on a cellulose plate at pH 1.9 in the first dimension and at pH 3.5 in the second dimension (insets). S, T, and Y indicate phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine, respectively. For Edman degradation, the remaining radioactive peptide samples were coupled to Sequelon-AA membranes and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems Gas Phase Sequencer. The activity in the released phenylthiohydantoin derivatives from each cycle was quantitated by use of a Bio-Imaging Analyzer. A–C show the results of Edman degradation and phosphoamino acid analysis(insets) of material from spots a, b,and c, respectively, on the two-dimensional map in Fig. 2. The amino acid sequences of Flt-1-derived tryptic peptides that could be aligned with the radiochemical sequencing are shown beloweach panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig. 3, radioactive peaks appeared for spota at cycle 16, for spot b at cycle 1, and for spot c at cycles 1 and 16. Complete trypsin digestion of the human Flt-1 IC would be expected to give rise to around 50 different peptides. Among these, only two peptides, encompassing Tyr-1242 and Tyr-1333, have a tyrosine residue at position 16. However, the peptide encompassing Tyr-1333 should be negatively charged at pH 1.9 and, therefore, would not migrate to the position of spot a on the two-dimensional mapping. On the other hand, the peptide encompassing Tyr-1242 has +1 charge at pH 1.9, which would be compatible with the position of spot a. In order to confirm this notion, the mutant Y1242F Flt-1 receptor IC domain was expressed in insect cells and subjected to immune complex kinase assays followed by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping in the same way as for the wild-type Flt-1 (Figs. 4 and 5). The fact that the spot ain the wild-type receptor analysis was missing from the two-dimensional map of the mutant Y1242F indicates that the peptide encompassing Tyr-1242 matches with spot a, and the Tyr-1242 is one of the tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Flt-1 (Fig. 5).Figure 5Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of mutant receptors. IC domains of the mutant receptors as well as the wild-type receptor (wt) were expressed in Sf9 cells and immunoprecipitated with the anti-Flt-1 antibody. The precipitates were subjected to kinase reactions in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The bands corresponding to IC domains of the wild-type and mutated receptors were excised and digested with trypsin, followed by two-dimensional mapping performed as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The two-dimensional maps show the wild-type (A) and mutant receptors (B, Y1242F;C, Y1213F; and D, Y914F). Arrows in B–D indicate spots missing from the mutant receptor two-dimensional maps.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Similarly, the two tryptic peptides encompassing Tyr-914 and Tyr-1213 are candidates for the spot b, since only these two peptides have a tyrosine residue at position 1 (Fig. 3 B). However, both peptides have +1 charge at pH 1.9 precluding the tentative assignment of one of them as spot b. The two-dimensional mapping of Y914F and Y1213F mutant receptors show that the spotb in the wild-type receptor is completely abolished in mutant Y1213F two-dimensional map, whereas it is still present in the two-dimensional mapping of Y914F (Fig. 5, C and D). These results indicate that Tyr-1213 is a second tyrosine phosphorylation site in Flt-1. It is noteworthy that spota in the wild-type receptor is missing in the mutant Y914F. Since Tyr-914 is located in the first kinase domain, it is possible that the mutation of this tyrosine may affect the kinase activity of Flt-1. Accordingly, the overall phosphorylation level of the Y914F mutant IC domain in the immune complex kinase assay was considerably lower than those of the wild-type and other mutant receptors (Fig. 4). We infer from these data that tyrosine phosphorylation of the Flt-1 IC was due to autophosphorylation and not phosphorylation by other kinases present in the Sf9 cells. The only tryptic peptide matching spot c is that encompassing Tyr-1242, in which Thr-1227 as well as Tyr-1242 are phosphorylated (Fig. 3 C). In agreement, spot c as well as spot a were missing from the two-dimensional map of the mutant Y1242F receptor (Fig. 5 B). Thus, Tyr-1213 and Tyr-1242 are the major tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Flt-1. To confirm these results in mammalian cells, porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells expressing Flt-1 were stimulated with VEGF (50 ng/ml), subjected to an immune complex kinase assay, and digested with trypsin, followed by two-dimensional mapping (Fig. 6). The two-dimensional mapping revealed spots at positions very similar to those obtained from the Flt-1 IC domain expressed in the baculosystem (see Fig. 2). Edman degradation confirmed that the spots a and b in Fig. 6 exactly correspond to the peptides encompassing Tyr-1242 and Tyr-1213, respectively (data not shown), indicating that Tyr-1213 and Tyr-1242 are tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Flt-1 expressed in mammalian cells. Most peptide fragments derived from the Flt-1 IC by trypsin digestion will be neutral or positively charged at pH 1.9. However, a peptide encompassing tyrosines 1327 and 1333 (IACCSPPPDY1327NSVVLY1333STPPI) will be negatively charged at pH 1.9 and would therefore not migrate to the right of the application spot (Δ). To investigate if the peptide YY1327/1333 is tyrosine-phosphorylated, the Flt-1 IC was digested with endopeptidase Asp-N instead of trypsin and subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping (Fig. 7). In the wild-type receptor, a few weakly phosphorylated spots (Fig. 7 A) as well as strong signals are seen. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that spot d contains phosphotyrosine but not phosphoserine and phosphothreonine (Fig. 7 B, inset). Edman degradation of peptide material eluted from"
https://openalex.org/W1981239721,"The oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) by mammalian 15-lipoxygenases (15-LOX) was implicated in early atherogenesis. We investigated the molecular mechanism of 15-LOX/LDL interaction and found that during short term incubations, LDL cholesterol esters are oxygenated preferentially by the enzyme. Even when the LDL particle was loaded with free linoleic acid, cholesteryl linoleate constituted the major LOX substrate. In contrast, only small amounts of free oxygenated fatty acid isomers were detected, and re-esterification of oxidized fatty acids into the LDL ester lipid fraction was ruled out. When LDL was depleted from α-tocopherol, specific oxygenation of the cholesterol esters was not prevented, and the product pattern was not altered. Similar results were obtained at low (LDL/LOX ratio of 1:1) and high LOX loading (LDL/LOX ratio of 1:10) of the LDL particle. During long term incubations (up to 24 h), a less specific product pattern was observed. However, when the hydroperoxy lipids formed by the 15-LOX were immediately reduced by the phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase, when the reaction was carried out with vitamin E-depleted LDL, or when the assay sample was diluted, the specific pattern of oxygenation products was retained over a long period of time.These data suggest that mammalian 15-LOX preferentially oxidize LDL cholesterol esters, forming a specific pattern of oxygenation products. During long term incubations, free radical-mediated secondary reactions, which lead to a more unspecific product pattern, may become increasingly important. These secondary reactions appear to be suppressed when the hydroperoxy lipids formed are immediately reduced, when α-tocopherol-depleted LDL was used, or when the incubation sample was diluted. It may be concluded that 15-LOX-initiated LDL oxidation constitutes a dual-type oxygenase reaction with an initial enzymatic and a subsequent nonenzymatic phase. The biological relevance of this dual-type reaction for atherogenesis will be discussed.

These secondary reactions appear to be suppressed when the hydroperoxy lipids formed are immediately reduced, when α-tocopherol-depleted LDL was used, or when the incubation sample was diluted. It may be concluded that 15-LOX-initiated LDL oxidation constitutes a dual-type oxygenase reaction with an initial enzymatic and a subsequent nonenzymatic phase. The biological relevance of this dual-type reaction for atherogenesis will be discussed. low density lipoprotein reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography straight phase HPLC 15-lipoxygenase (13S,9Z,11E)-13-hydroxyoctadeca-9,11-dienoic acid (9S/R,10E,12Z)-9-hydroxyoctadeca-10,12-dienoic acid polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio hydroxy fatty acid/polyenoic fatty acid phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase.

On the other hand, transgenic rabbits that overexpress the 15-LOX specifically in monocyte/macrophages (17Shen J. Kühn H. Petho-Schramm A. Chan L.

Sparrow et al. (6Sparrow C.P. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 745-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the 15-LOX from soybeans is capable of oxidizing LDL in the presence of phospholipase A2. Later on, we reported that the native rabbit (19Belkner J. Wiesner R. Rathman J. Barnett J. Sigal E. Kühn H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and the recombinant human 15-LOX (20Kühn H. Barnett J. Grunberger D. Baecker P. Chow J. Nguyen B. Bursztyn-Pettegrew H. Chan H. Sigal E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) specifically oxidize LDL ester lipids in the absence of lipid-hydrolyzing enzymes. Comparison of various LOX isoenzymes indicated that mammalian 15-LOXs and the leukocyte-type 12-LOX show a high LDL-oxidizing capability, whereas the human 5-LOX, the platelet-type 12-LOX, and the soybean LOX-1 were poor catalysts (7Kühn H. Belkner J. Suzuki H. Yamamoto S. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1749-1759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it was shown that 15-LOX treatment rendered the LDL particle more susceptible to copper-catalyzed oxidation (21O′Leary V.J. Darley-Usmar V.M. Russell L.J. Stone D. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22Lass A. Belkner J. Esterbauer H. Kühn H. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).More recently, the long term interaction of the recombinant human 15-LOX with isolated LDL was investigated (23Upston J.M. Neuzil J. Stocker R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 386-397Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 24Upston J.M. Neuzil J. Witting P.K. Alleva R. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30067-30074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It was concluded that the enzyme initiates LDL oxidation by preferentially oxygenating the free fatty acids present in the LDL particle. Radical intermediates formed during this reaction may subsequently induce oxidation of LDL ester lipids via α-tocopherol-mediated lipid peroxidation. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that α-tocopherol-depleted LDL appeared to be resistant toward 15-LOX-initiated oxidation (23Upston J.M. Neuzil J. Stocker R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 386-397Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). However, these mechanistic conclusions were not consistent with the specific pattern of oxygenation products described in previous reports (7Kühn H. Belkner J. Suzuki H. Yamamoto S. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1749-1759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Belkner J. Wiesner R. Rathman J. Barnett J. Sigal E. Kühn H. Eur. J.

J. 1996; 314: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Because of this discrepancy, we re-investigated the interaction of a mammalian 15-LOX with native and vitamin E-depleted LDL and found that the rabbit 15-LOX preferentially oxidizes LDL cholesterol esters when incubated with native or with linoleic acid-loaded LDL and that the α-tocopherol content of the LDL particle was not of major importance for the enzymatic reaction.DISCUSSION15-LOXs are lipid-peroxidizing enzymes that are capable of oxygenating the lipids of biomembranes (33Schewe T. Halangk W. Hiebsch C. Rapoport S.M. FEBS Lett. 1975; 60: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 34Murray J.J. Brash A.R. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1990; 265: 18351-18361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lipoproteins (7Kühn H. Belkner J. Suzuki H. Yamamoto S. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1749-1759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Belkner J. Wiesner R. Rathman J. Barnett J. Sigal E. Kühn H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Lass A. Belkner J. Esterbauer H. Kühn H. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In LDL, the cholesterol esters are preferentially oxygenated. This finding was somewhat surprising since the majority of the cholesterol esters are localized in the hydrophobic core of the LDL particle, and the enzyme may not be capable of penetrating into this micro environment. However, a certain percentage of the cholesterol ester is also present in the LDL shell and thus may be attacked by the 15-LOX (19Belkner J. Wiesner R. Rathman J. Barnett J. Sigal E. Kühn H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Lass A. Belkner J. Esterbauer H. Kühn H. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although substantial amounts of cholesteryl arachidonate are present in LDL particle, we did not find significant amounts of the corresponding hydroxy derivatives. One reason for the lack of these compounds may be the fact that they can be further metabolized to double and/or triple oxygenation products, which have actually been observed in RP-HPLC. The free fatty acids present in LDL may also be oxidized, but LOX catalysis is not restricted to them. When we analyzed the PUFA content of the LDL particle, we detected 1–2 nmol of free linoleic acid/nmol of apoB. If only free polyenoic fatty acids would have been oxygenated by the LOX, a hydroxy fatty acid/PUFA ratio of about 0.1% would be expected. However, we found hydroxy fatty acid/PUFA ratios of 1% up to 10%. Moreover, HPLC analysis of the ester lipid fraction of 15-LOX-treated LDL indicated large amounts of specifically oxidized cholesterol esters (Fig. 2). Since esterification of free oxygenated polyenoic fatty acids into the LDL cholesterol esters does not occur (Fig. 6), cholesterol esters appear to be the preferred 15-LOX substrates in human LDL. Even under the conditions of strong linoleic acid loading (20-fold increase in the free linoleic acid content of the LDL particle), the relative share of the oxygenation products originating from free fatty acids was less than 10% of the amount of oxygenated cholesterol esters. It may be possible that incorporation of fatty acid molecules into an LDL particle may impair the availability for the 15-LOX.The vitamin E content of the LDL may not be of major importance for 15-LOX-catalyzed oxidation of LDL cholesterol esters. At short term incubations, when the 15-LOX reaction can be measured best, there was no difference in the oxygenation rate of native and α-tocopherol-depleted LDL. However, at long term incubations, native LDL shows a higher sensitivity toward oxidation than the vitamin E-depleted lipoprotein (Table IV). These data suggest that at longer incubation periods, vitamin E-dependent secondary oxidation reactions may take place. It has been reported before that in the presence of hydroperoxides, vitamin E may be capable of mediating peroxidation of unsaturated lipids via the formation of an α-tocopheryl radical (36Bowry V.W. Stocker R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 6029-6040Crossref Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 37Bowry V.W. Mohr D. Cleary J. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5756-5763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and this reaction has recently been implicated in 15-LOX-initiated LDL oxidation (23Upston J.M. Neuzil J. Stocker R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 386-397Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 24Upston J.M. Neuzil J. Witting P.K. Alleva R. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30067-30074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). According to our results, the specific 15-LOX-catalyzed oxidation of LDL cholesterol esters is not influenced by vitamin E. However, the cholesterol ester hydroperoxides formed by the enzyme may serve as starters for α-tocopherol-mediated lipid peroxidation. When the lipid hydroperoxides are quickly reduced to their corresponding hydroxy derivatives, these secondary reactions may not take place anymore. These data suggest that 15-LOX-initiated LDL oxidation appears to be a dual process: (i) 15-LOX-catalyzed oxygenation of LDL cholesterol esters, leading to the formation of specific oxygenation products; (ii) nonenzymatic vitamin E-dependent secondary reactions, forming an unspecific product pattern. At short term incubations, at low LDL concentrations, with vitamin E-depleted LDL, and when the incubation is carried out in the presence of a peroxide-reducing enzyme, vitamin E-dependent secondary reactions are largely suppressed. However, during long term incubations of native LDL, vitamin E-mediated secondary reactions may become increasingly important with time. If one translates these findings into the in vivo situation, one may conclude that 15-LOX-catalyzed oxidation of LDL ester lipids may always take place when a functional 15-LOX and LDL get in physical contact. In contrast, vitamin E-dependent LDL oxidation may only take place when the oxidative processes in the micro environment exceed the reductive capacity so that the 15-LOX-derived peroxides survive and may initiate vitamin E-dependent secondary reactions. Thus, the reductive capacity in the developing atherosclerotic plaque appears to be of major importance. It may be speculated that at early stages of lesion development when the LDL concentration in the arterial wall is rather low and when the reductive capacity exceeds the oxidative processes, 15-LOX-catalyzed oxygenation of LDL ester lipids may prevail. During these stages of plaque development, specific 15-LOX products may be detectable (10Kühn H. Belkner J. Zaiss S. Fährenklemper T. Wohlfeil S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1903-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 11Folcik V.A. Nivar-Aristy R.A. Krajewski L.P. Cathcardt M.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). At later stages, however, when the LDL concentration in the plaque is higher and the oxidation processes overcome the reductive capacity, 15-LOX-derived peroxides may accumulate and may initiate secondary oxidation reactions. Under these conditions (advanced lesions), mainly unspecific lipid peroxidation products can be found (38Harland W.A. Gilbert D.G. Brooks C.J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 316: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 39Kühn H. Belkner J. Wiesner R. Schewe T. Lankin V.Z. Tikhaze A.K. Eicosanoids. 1992; 5: 17-22PubMed Google Scholar).The result that 15-LOX-initiated lipid peroxidation may lead to a rather unspecific pattern of oxygenation products is of importance for the interpretation of the analytical data of oxygenated lipids obtained from biological sources. A specific product pattern is suggestive for the involvement of a LOX. However, an unspecific product pattern does not exclude the involvement of this enzyme. Moreover, our data suggest that a specific share of LOX products can only be detected in biological samples when the hydroperoxides formed by the enzyme are quickly reduced to the corresponding hydroxy compounds. This requires a high reductive capacity, which is characteristic for most 15-LOX-containing cells. However, if the reductive capacity is overcome by the oxidative processes, 15-LOX-derived hydroperoxides may accumulate and serve as substrate for free radical-mediated oxygenation reactions. The products of these secondary reactions will overlay the specific 15-LOX products, and the specific product pattern will not be detectable any more.It is well established that oxidized LDL is taken up by macrophages via scavenger receptors and/or oxidized LDL receptor-mediated pathways. However, little is known about the metabolic fate of the internalized oxidized lipids. Recently, it has been shown that free oxygenated linoleic acid derivatives (13-HODE, 9-HODE) activate the transcription of peroxisome proliferation activation receptor γ-dependent genes (40Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G.A. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar), which are involved in monocyte/macrophage differentiation (41Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J.G.A. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the oxidized cholesterol esters did not activate gene transcription (40Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G.A. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the oxidized ester lipids must be hydrolyzed before acting as peroxisome proliferation activation receptor γ ligands. Several intracellular lipid-hydrolyzing enzymes such as phospholipases and/or triglyceride lipases as well as the hormone-sensitive neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (42Khoo J.C. Mahoney E.M. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12659-12661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Middleton B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 830-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) may be involved. We carried out a series of in vitro experiments with the neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase of murine macrophages and found that oxidized cholesterol ester are well hydrolyzed by this enzyme. In fact, when oxidized and nonoxidized cholesteryl linoleate were compared, the oxidized lipids turned out to be a better substrate. 2J. Belkner and H. Kühn, unpublished data.

However, these mechanistic conclusions were not consistent with the specific pattern of oxygenation products described in previous reports (7Kühn H. Belkner J. Suzuki H. Yamamoto S. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1749-1759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Belkner J. Wiesner R. Rathman J. Barnett J. Sigal E. Kühn H. Eur. J.

Because of this discrepancy, we re-investigated the interaction of a mammalian 15-LOX with native and vitamin E-depleted LDL and found that the rabbit 15-LOX preferentially oxidizes LDL cholesterol esters when incubated with native or with linoleic acid-loaded LDL and that the α-tocopherol content of the LDL particle was not of major importance for the enzymatic reaction. DISCUSSION15-LOXs are lipid-peroxidizing enzymes that are capable of oxygenating the lipids of biomembranes (33Schewe T. Halangk W. Hiebsch C. Rapoport S.M. FEBS Lett. 1975; 60: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 34Murray J.J. Brash A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 265: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Kühn H.

Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1749-1759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Belkner J. Wiesner R. Rathman J. Barnett J. Sigal E. Kühn H. Eur. J.

In LDL, the cholesterol esters are preferentially oxygenated. This finding was somewhat surprising since the majority of the cholesterol esters are localized in the hydrophobic core of the LDL particle, and the enzyme may not be capable of penetrating into this micro environment. However, a certain percentage of the cholesterol ester is also present in the LDL shell and thus may be attacked by the 15-LOX (19Belkner J. Wiesner R. Rathman J. Barnett J. Sigal E. Kühn H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Lass A. Belkner J. Esterbauer H. Kühn H. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although substantial amounts of cholesteryl arachidonate are present in LDL particle, we did not find significant amounts of the corresponding hydroxy derivatives. One reason for the lack of these compounds may be the fact that they can be further metabolized to double and/or triple oxygenation products, which have actually been observed in RP-HPLC. The free fatty acids present in LDL may also be oxidized, but LOX catalysis is not restricted to them. When we analyzed the PUFA content of the LDL particle, we detected 1–2 nmol of free linoleic acid/nmol of apoB. If only free polyenoic fatty acids would have been oxygenated by the LOX, a hydroxy fatty acid/PUFA ratio of about 0.1% would be expected. However, we found hydroxy fatty acid/PUFA ratios of 1% up to 10%. Moreover, HPLC analysis of the ester lipid fraction of 15-LOX-treated LDL indicated large amounts of specifically oxidized cholesterol esters (Fig. 2). Since esterification of free oxygenated polyenoic fatty acids into the LDL cholesterol esters does not occur (Fig. 6), cholesterol esters appear to be the preferred 15-LOX substrates in human LDL. Even under the conditions of strong linoleic acid loading (20-fold increase in the free linoleic acid content of the LDL particle), the relative share of the oxygenation products originating from free fatty acids was less than 10% of the amount of oxygenated cholesterol esters. It may be possible that incorporation of fatty acid molecules into an LDL particle may impair the availability for the 15-LOX.The vitamin E content of the LDL may not be of major importance for 15-LOX-catalyzed oxidation of LDL cholesterol esters. At short term incubations, when the 15-LOX reaction can be measured best, there was no difference in the oxygenation rate of native and α-tocopherol-depleted LDL. However, at long term incubations, native LDL shows a higher sensitivity toward oxidation than the vitamin E-depleted lipoprotein (Table IV). These data suggest that at longer incubation periods, vitamin E-dependent secondary oxidation reactions may take place. It has been reported before that in the presence of hydroperoxides, vitamin E may be capable of mediating peroxidation of unsaturated lipids via the formation of an α-tocopheryl radical (36Bowry V.W. Stocker R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 6029-6040Crossref Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 37Bowry V.W. Mohr D. Cleary J. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5756-5763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and this reaction has recently been implicated in 15-LOX-initiated LDL oxidation (23Upston J.M. Neuzil J. Stocker R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 386-397Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 24Upston J.M. Neuzil J. Witting P.K. Alleva R. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30067-30074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). According to our results, the specific 15-LOX-catalyzed oxidation of LDL cholesterol esters is not influenced by vitamin E. However, the cholesterol ester hydroperoxides formed by the enzyme may serve as starters for α-tocopherol-mediated lipid peroxidation. When the lipid hydroperoxides are quickly reduced to their corresponding hydroxy derivatives, these secondary reactions may not take place anymore. These data suggest that 15-LOX-initiated LDL oxidation appears to be a dual process: (i) 15-LOX-catalyzed oxygenation of LDL cholesterol esters, leading to the formation of specific oxygenation products; (ii) nonenzymatic vitamin E-dependent secondary reactions, forming an unspecific product pattern. At short term incubations, at low LDL concentrations, with vitamin E-depleted LDL, and when the incubation is carried out in the presence of a peroxide-reducing enzyme, vitamin E-dependent secondary reactions are largely suppressed. However, during long term incubations of native LDL, vitamin E-mediated secondary reactions may become increasingly important with time. If one translates these findings into the in vivo situation, one may conclude that 15-LOX-catalyzed oxidation of LDL ester lipids may always take place when a functional 15-LOX and LDL get in physical contact. In contrast, vitamin E-dependent LDL oxidation may only take place when the oxidative processes in the micro environment exceed the reductive capacity so that the 15-LOX-derived peroxides survive and may initiate vitamin E-dependent secondary reactions. Thus, the reductive capacity in the developing atherosclerotic plaque appears to be of major importance. It may be speculated that at early stages of lesion development when the LDL concentration in the arterial wall is rather low and when the reductive capacity exceeds the oxidative processes, 15-LOX-catalyzed oxygenation of LDL ester lipids may prevail. During these stages of plaque development, specific 15-LOX products may be detectable (10Kühn H. Belkner J. Zaiss S. Fährenklemper T. Wohlfeil S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1903-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 11Folcik V.A. Nivar-Aristy R.A. Krajewski L.P. Cathcardt M.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). At later stages, however, when the LDL concentration in the plaque is higher and the oxidation processes overcome the reductive capacity, 15-LOX-derived peroxides may accumulate and may initiate secondary oxidation reactions. Under these conditions (advanced lesions), mainly unspecific lipid peroxidation products can be found (38Harland W.A. Gilbert D.G. Brooks C.J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 316: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 39Kühn H. Belkner J. Wiesner R. Schewe T. Lankin V.Z. Tikhaze A.K. Eicosanoids. 1992; 5: 17-22PubMed Google Scholar).The result that 15-LOX-initiated lipid peroxidation may lead to a rather unspecific pattern of oxygenation products is of importance for the interpretation of the analytical data of oxygenated lipids obtained from biological sources. A specific product pattern is suggestive for the involvement of a LOX. However, an unspecific product pattern does not exclude the involvement of this enzyme. Moreover, our data suggest that a specific share of LOX products can only be detected in biological samples when the hydroperoxides formed by the enzyme are quickly reduced to the corresponding hydroxy compounds. This requires a high reductive capacity, which is characteristic for most 15-LOX-containing cells. However, if the reductive capacity is overcome by the oxidative processes, 15-LOX-derived hydroperoxides may accumulate and serve as substrate for free radical-mediated oxygenation reactions. The products of these secondary reactions will overlay the specific 15-LOX products, and the specific product pattern will not be detectable any more.It is well established that oxidized LDL is taken up by macrophages via scavenger receptors and/or oxidized LDL receptor-mediated pathways. However, little is known about the metabolic fate of the internalized oxidized lipids. Recently, it has been shown that free oxygenated linoleic acid derivatives (13-HODE, 9-HODE) activate the transcription of peroxisome proliferation activation receptor γ-dependent genes (40Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G.A. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar), which are involved in monocyte/macrophage differentiation (41Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J.G.A. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the oxidized cholesterol esters did not activate gene transcription (40Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G.A. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the oxidized ester lipids must be hydrolyzed before acting as peroxisome proliferation activation receptor γ ligands. Several intracellular lipid-hydrolyzing enzymes such as phospholipases and/or triglyceride lipases as well as the hormone-sensitive neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (42Khoo J.C. Mahoney E.M.

We carried out a series of in vitro experiments with the neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase of murine macrophages and found that oxidized cholesterol ester are well hydrolyzed by this enzyme.

IPF-1.c-myc expression also enhanced the response of the insulin promoter to elevations in extracellular glucose concentration. In the majority (148/235, 63%) of cells maintained at low (3 mm) extracellular glucose concentration, IPF-1.c-myc immunoreactivity was confined to the nuclear periphery.

Transcriptional activity is regulated by numerous trans-acting factors acting at multiple recognition sites in the immediate 5′ flanking region of the gene (2German M. Ashcroft S. Docherty K.

To determine whether such a mechanism may be involved in the activation of IPF-1 by glucose, we have expressed epitope-tagged IPF-1 in the glucose-responsive β-cell line MIN6. The localization of the protein was then monitored by immunocytochemistry and laser-scanning confocal microscopy. We show that in the majority of single cells incubated at low glucose concentrations, IPF-1.c-myc is associated with the nuclear periphery and the nuclear membrane region. Incubation of cells at elevated glucose concentrations stimulated the transcriptional activity of an insulin promoter reporter construct monitored in single living MIN6 β-cells and caused a concomitant shift in the localization of IPF-1 into the nucleoplasm. These data implicate translocation of this factor as an important element in the activation of the insulin gene by elevations in blood glucose concentration.

The latter was based on plasmid pGL3 (Promega) encoding firefly luciferase, modified by removal of the immediate C-terminal peroxisomal targeting sequence (15Sherf B.A. Wood K.V.

Lipoamine-mediated transfection was performed using Tfx-50TM (Promega) using 2.5 μg of DNA/35-mm dish and a 3:1 charge ratio of Tfx-50:DNA in serum-free medium. Cells were transfected by incubation for 2 h at 37 °C with the DNA mixture. Transfection efficiency was typically between 1–5%. Photon counting digital imaging was performed using a cooled intensified photon camera (Photek, Lewes, UK) and Olympus IX-70 microscope (× 10, 0.4 numerical aperture objective) as described previously (21Rutter G.A.

Briefly, firefly luciferase activity was measured by imaging 5 min in the presence of 1 mm luciferin, and the sum of firefly and R. reniformis luciferases were assessed by a further 5-min imaging period in the presence of 5 μmcoelenterazine. Cells were fixed and permeabilized with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde plus 0.2% Triton X-100. Primary antibodies were revealed with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies in 0.2% (v/v) bovine serum albumin. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline between incubations and mounted on coverslips with Mowiol before analysis. Confocal images were captured using a Leica TCS 4D/DM IRBE laser-scanning confocal microscope (× 63/1.32 NA PL-Apo oil-immersion lens) equipped with a krypton/argon laser (488 and 568 nm excitation lines) and were analyzed off-line using Adobe PhotoshopTM. Cells were incubated in Krebs-Ringer medium comprising (in mm) 125 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 0.5 MgSO4, 0.5 KH2PO4, 2.5 NaHCO3, 3 glucose, 10 Hepes-Na+, pH 7.4, equilibrated with O2:CO2 (95:5 %). Cells were then transferred to the thermostatted (37 °C) stage of a Leica DM IRBE inverted optics confocal microscope fitted with a × 40/1.0 NA PL Fluotar oil-immersion objective and controlled by TCS-NT4 software (Leica). Optical sections (0.5 μm) were obtained with 8–16 sweeps of the laser. Data are presented as means ± S.E. for the number of parameters given in parentheses. We first explored the possibility of monitoring the localization of endogenous IPF-1 in MIN6 β-cells by direct immunocytochemistry. An anti-peptide antibody was generated to the immediate C terminus of the protein, a region predicted to show high antigenicity. Analyzed by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry, the immunopurified polyclonal antibody reacted strongly and specifically with IPF-1.c-myc overexpressed in either COS7 (data not shown) or MIN6 β-cells (see Fig. 3,panels g and j). However, the level of endogenous IPF-1 in single MIN6 cells was below that which could be detected with this antibody. Because IPF-1 mRNA could readily be detected in MIN6 cells by reverse-transcription-PCR (data not shown), we used this technique to construct and overexpress cDNA encoding c-mycepitope-tagged IPF-1. To confirm that the recombinant expressed chimera retained normal trans-activational capacity, we examined the ability of expressed IPF-1.c-myc to enhance the activity of the proximal promoter region of the human insulin gene (Fig. 1). Photon counting digital imaging of single living MIN6 cells (21Rutter G.A. White M.R.H. Tavaré J.M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 890-899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23Kennedy H.J. Viollet B. Rafiq I. Kahn A. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was used to compare the activity of firefly luciferase, expressed under insulin promoter control, to that of the distinct R. reniformis luciferase. The latter, distinct photoprotein, was expressed under cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene (CMV) promoter control. This technique allowed correction for marked differences in the activity of the basal transcriptional/translational machinery between individual cells and cell cultures. Co-microinjection of cDNA encoding IPF-1.c-myc increased the ratio of firefly:R. reniformis luciferases 6.5-fold 24 h after injection, from 0.026 ± 0.003 (n = 31 cells co-microinjected with empty pcDNA3) to 0.17 ± 0.061 (n = 9 cells microinjected with plasmid IPF-1.c-myc, p < 0.001) in MIN6 cells maintained at stimulatory (30 mm) glucose concentration. Similarly, IPF-1.c-myc expression increased the firefly:R. reniformis luciferase ratio from 0.037 ± 0.016 (n = 28 cells) to 0.086 ± 0.024 (n = 21) in CHO.T cells, confirming the transactivational activity of the recombinant factor in the absence of other β-cell proteins. Overexpression of IPF-1.c-myc increased the response of the insulin promoter to culture of MIN6 cells at high versus low glucose concentrations (Fig. 2, Table I). Thus, the response of the insulin promoter to an increase in glucose concentration from 3 to 30 mm was small or zero in cells microinjected with empty pcDNA3 plasmid (Fig. 2, a−d; Table I). By contrast, in cells co-microinjected with IPF-1.c-myc,elevations of extracellular glucose to 30 mm increased markedly the ratio of firefly:Renilla luciferase (Fig. 2,e−h; Table I), indicating insulin promoter activation. This effect of glucose was rapid, with a similar -fold activation observed after incubation for 5 or 24 h at elevated glucose concentrations (Table I, experiments 3 and 4).Table IEffect of IPF-1.c-myc on the response to elevated glucose concentrations of the insulin promoter (−260 to −60) region in single MIN6 β-cellsPlasmid/experimentGlucoseIncubation timeInsulin promoter activity as ratio firefly:RenillaluciferaseNumber of cells examined-Fold effect of 30 mm glucosemmhpcDNA3 13240.134 ± 0.02627300.22 ± 0.05825NS 2350.30 ± 0.05619300.25 ± 0.0811NSIPF-1.c-myc 33240.006 ± 0.00222300.027 ± 0.011*194.5 4350.078 ± 0.02433300.17 ± 0.028**282.2Cells were maintained for 48 h in medium containing 3 mm glucose before microinjection with pINS(260–60)Luc (0.35 mg·ml−1), pRL.CMV (0.08 mg·ml−1), and either pcDNA3 (experiments 1, 0.15 mg·ml−1; 2, 0.05 mg·ml−1) or IPF-1c-myc (concentrations as experiment 1 and 2, respectively).

Overexpressed IPF-1.c-myc could readily be visualized in fixed and permeabilized MIN6 cells, using either anti-c-myc antibodies (Figs. 3 and 4), or IgG derived from polyclonal anti-mouse IPF-1 antiserum (Fig. 3, images g and j). In MIN6 cells previously cultured 24 h at 3 mmglucose, IPF-1.c-myc was localized in the majority of cells to the nuclear periphery (Table II; Fig. 3, a, g, and m). In the remaining cells, the construct was localized to both the nuclear periphery and the nucleoplasm, with exclusion from the nucleosomes (data not shown). No appreciable IPF-1.c-myc immunoreactivity was detectable in the cell cytosol.Table IIEffect of glucose on subcellular distribution of IPF-1.c-mycPlasmid/incubation timeNumber of cells showing predominantly peripheral or nucleoplasmic localization of the c-myc epitope tag at the indicated glucose concentration in mm3.030.0IPF-1.c-myc (a) 48 hNuclear periphery148183Nucleoplasm87775Peripheral63%19.1% (b) 60 min.Nuclear periphery55Nucleoplasm195PeripheralND20.9% (c) 120 min.Nuclear periphery51Nucleoplasm244PeripheralND17.2%c-Fos.c-myc (d) 24 hNuclear periphery10Nucleoplasm3530Peripheral2.7%0%MIN6 cells were cultured for 24 h at 3 mm glucose before transfection with IPF-1.c-myc or c-Fos.mycas indicated (a and d).

After transfection, cells were subsequently incubated at the given glucose concentrations for 48 h prior to fixation and permeabilization.

Distribution of IPF-1.c-myc or c-Fos.c-myc was then assessed as predominantly either nucleoplasmic or peripheral by conventional fluorescence microscopy. ND, not determined. In cells maintained at 3 mm glucose, the stained region was shown to correspond to the nuclear periphery by co-labeling of the nucleoplasm with a DNA-binding stain (Fig. 3,a−f), and by colocalization with antibodies to the nuclear pore protein, nucleoporin (Fig. 3,g−l). By contrast, cells incubated for the same period in the presence of 30 mm glucose displayed largely nucleoplasmic localization of IPF-1 (Fig. 3, d, j, and p). However, the subcellular localization of a chimera between c-Fos and firefly luciferase (c-Fos.luc) was unaffected by glucose in cells where clear redistribution of IPF-1.c-myc was apparent (Fig. 3,m−r). We next analyzed the ability of the IPF-1.c-myc chimera to translocate from the nuclear periphery to the nucleoplasm over the time-frame of the gene expression experiments. We performed quantitative confocal digital image analysis to determine the extent of the shift of IPF-1.c-myc elicited by a 60-min incubation at high glucose concentrations (Fig. 4). In three cells cultured at 3 mm glucose and analyzed as in Fig. 4, the mean ratio of nucleoplasmic:peripheral fluorescence was 0.32 ± 0.09. This ratio was increased in cells maintained in the presence of 30 mm glucose to 1.22 ± 0.35 (n = 4 cells). The shift from the nuclear membrane to the nucleoplasm was assessed in large populations exposed to elevated glucose for 60 min, 120 min, or 24 h (Table II). The distribution of the chimera was scored as predominantly either peripheral to the nucleus or nucleoplasmic. Incubation at 30 mm glucose caused a dramatic increase in the proportion of cells displaying predominantly nucleoplasmic localization (Table II). This was not associated with any overall increase in the level of expression of IPF-1.c-myc at the higher glucose concentration. No correlation was observed between overall fluorescence intensity and subcellular distribution at either glucose concentration examined (data not shown). By contrast to the apparent shift of IPF-1.c-myc, no significant change in the localization of c-Fos.c-myc was apparent (Table II) as also observed with a c-Fos.luciferase chimera (Fig. 3). With each of these chimeras, predominantly nucleoplasmic localization was observed at either 3 or 30 mm glucose. These data indicate that the c-myc epitope tag of IPF-1.c-myc was not responsible for the localization of the protein at the nuclear periphery. To monitor the movement of IPF-1 dynamically in single living cells, we constructed a chimera in which IPF-1 was fused at its C terminus with enhanced green fluorescent protein (IPF-1.EGFP). In contrast to IPF-1.c-myc, this chimera did not support the transactivation of the insulin promoter-luciferase construct by glucose (data not shown). Furthermore, fluorescence of the EGFP chimera was confined in both living and fixed MIN6 cells to the nucleoplasm, irrespective of the extracellular glucose concentration (data not shown). We describe here the construction and expression in MIN6 cells of an IPF-1.c-myc chimera. The recombinant factor was transcriptionally active and enhanced the responsiveness of the proximal regulatory region of the human insulin promoter to increases in extracellular glucose concentration. In cells maintained at low glucose concentrations, IPF-1.c-myc was localized to an area of the nucleoplasm immediately beneath the nuclear membrane. Incubation at elevated glucose concentrations caused a rapid redistribution of IPF-1.c-myc to the nucleoplasm. Arguing that this translocation was not the result of artifacts caused by the overexpression of myc-tagged IPF-1, there was no correlation between the level of IPF-1 expression and the distribution of the chimera between the nuclear periphery and the nucleoplasm. Furthermore, we did not observe any translocation of two other nuclear targeted proteins (c-myc-tagged c-Fos, Table II, and a c-Fos.firefly luciferase chimera, Fig. 2, m−r). The latter observation would appear also to exclude the possibility that fixation/permeabilization artifacts could be responsible for the apparent localization of the chimera at the nuclear periphery. What may be the physical basis of the distribution of IPF-1.c-myc at the nuclear periphery? IPF-1.c-mycwas not localized exclusively to the nuclear membrane nor did the chimera perfectly colocalize in the region presumed to be the membrane, with the nuclear pore complex protein, nucleoporin. Instead, there was a steep gradient of IPF-1.c-myc from the nuclear membrane leading into the center of the nucleoplasm (e.g. see Fig. 3,g and i). Similarly, in a minority of cells expressing IPF-1.EGFP, and maintained at 3 mm (but not 30 mm) glucose, fluorescence was observed at the rim of the nucleus. This fluorescence was largely immobile, as monitored by time-lapse confocal microscopy over > 30 min (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that in cells exposed to 3 mmglucose, endogenous IPF-1 may be tethered to immobile anchors immediately beneath the plasma membrane. The nature of these tethers is unclear, however, although it might be speculated that nuclear microfilaments/microtubules may be involved. The markedly reduced appearance of EGFP-extended IPF-1 at the nuclear periphery, and the failure of the chimera to respond to elevated glucose concentrations, may indicate that the bulky (27 kDa) EGFP moiety (24Heim R. Cubitt A.B. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1995; 373: 663-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar) disrupts an interaction between IPF-1 and the usual tethering site near the nuclear membrane. Recent data have suggested that other transcription factors may also be associated with the nuclear periphery under certain circumstances, via specific interactions with nuclear membrane proteins. For example, the transcription factor Sp1 (25Roder K. Wolf S.S. Beck K.-F. Schweizer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21616-21624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) has been shown by yeast 2-hybrid analysis to interact strongly with the nuclear pore protein p62. Of particular relevance to the current work, Sp1 may be involved in the regulation by extracellular glucose of the fatty acid synthase promoter (26Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Furthermore, close inspection of the data of Bonny et al.(27Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1843-1846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3E) suggests that the β-cell-specific JIP homologue IB1 may also be localized to the nuclear periphery. Like IPF-1, the latter transcription factor is also implicated in the regulation of the glucose-sensitive GLUT-2 gene in β-cells (27Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1843-1846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), suggesting that localization to the nuclear periphery may be a general phenomenon for glucose-sensitive transcription factors. The mechanisms responsible for eliciting the shift in IPF-1 are unknown. However, previous studies (28MacFarlane W.M. Read M.L. Gilligan M. Bujalska I. Docherty K. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have suggested that changes in the DNA binding activity of IPF-1 by glucose may involve changes in the phosphorylation state of the protein. Phosphorylation of IPF-1 on one or more sites would appear a plausible means of altering the interaction between this factor and its putative tethering molecule. What may be the role for the placement of IPF-1 at the nuclear periphery? In unstimulated cells, incubated at low glucose concentrations, this would be expected to reduce the concentration of the transcription factor in the nucleoplasm where it is able to interact with the promoter regions of insulin (and other gene(s)). Activation of the insulin, GLUT2, and glucokinase promoters might therefore be expected under conditions where there was a shift of IPF-1 to the nucleoplasm. This was indeed observed with an insulin promoter-reporter construct in single living MIN6 cells after exposure to elevated glucose concentrations. In support of the view that the translocation to the nucleoplasm may be important for the activation of the insulin gene by glucose, we failed to observe any stimulation in cells overexpressing an IPF-1.EGFP chimera. In the majority of cells examined, this chimera failed to translocate between the nuclear periphery and the nucleoplasm. Furthermore, movement of IPF-1.c-myc between the nuclear periphery and the nucleoplasm was not observed in another β-cell line, INS-1 (data not shown), where glucose has little or no effect on insulin gene expression (data not shown and Ref. 29Marie S. Diaz-Guerra M.-J. Miquerol L. Kahn A. Iynedjian P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23881-23890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to a role in transcriptional regulation, it might also be speculated that the localization of IPF-1 at the nuclear periphery plays a role in controlling the flow of traffic across the nuclear membrane. For example, this may inhibit the exit from the nucleus of insulin and other mRNAs at low glucose concentrations. In conclusion, translocation of IPF-1 from the nuclear periphery to the nucleoplasm may be an important mechanism for the activation of the insulin and other promoters in response to elevations in extracellular glucose. Defective translocation of IPF-1 may therefore represent a potential defect in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

In contrast, FER is expressed ubiquitously and its function remains poorly understood. FER is structurally distinct from members of the other cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase families; its amino acid sequence contains a catalytic domain adjacent to a single Src homology 2 (SH2)1 domain and an extensive coiled coil sequence in the amino terminus (2Hao Q.L. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1587-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We previously showed that FER is tightly associated with the novel catenin pp120 and that the FER·pp120 complex is phosphorylated on tyrosines upon treatment of cells with growth factors (10Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, the significance of the interaction remains to be elucidated, because the function of pp120 is also not well understood. Tyrosine phosphorylation has been demonstrated to be an important mechanism for regulating cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesions. For example, inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells results in the deterioration of adherens junctions and dramatic changes in cell morphology (11Volberg T. Zick Y. Dror R. Sabanay I. Gilon C. Levitzki A. Geiger B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1733-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Treatment of epithelial cells with epidermal growth factor leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin, plakoglobin and pp120, as well as changes in cell morphology (12Hoschuetzky H. Aberle H. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 13Welsh J.B. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). More importantly, the major targets of v-src kinase activity have been shown to be proteins that are directly implicated in cell adhesion or cytoskeletal function. These include focal adhesion kinase, cortactin, p130cas, and pp120 (14Scheller M.D. Bouton A.H. Flynn D.C. Parsons J.T. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1993; 44: 205-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Results of subcellular localization and functional characterization have implicated these proteins in regulating cell motility or membrane cytoskeleton dynamics. Focal adhesion kinase and p130cas are localized to focal adhesion complexes and focal adhesion kinase has been demonstrated to be required for the turnover of the cellular structures (15Ilic D.

Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 21Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). pp120 is a component of the cadherin-catenin complexes and, as such, may be involved in membrane-cytoskeleton interactions (22Reynolds A.B. Daniel J. McCrea P. Wheelock M.J. Zhang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8333-8342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The association of FER and pp120, and their phosphorylation in cells treated with growth factors, led us to speculate that FER may be involved in a signaling pathway linking growth factor receptors with cell adhesion or the cytoskeleton. In this report, we describe studies aimed at further characterization of the interaction of FER with other cellular components. We also report on the results of experiments, using a dominant-negative FER mutant, that seek to analyze the function of the FER kinase. NIH3T3 and human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. Glutathione S-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-pp120 antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. Monoclonal anti-cortactin antibody (4F11) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-hemagglutinin (12CA5) antibodies were from Boehringer Mannheim. Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory. Polyclonal anti-dynamin antibodies were provided by Dr. Mark McNiven of the Mayo Clinic. Polyclonal FER1 and FER5 antisera were described previously (10Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). They were generated by immunizing rabbits with fusion proteins that contain codons 502–675 and codons 451–564 of FER, respectively. Antiserum FER2 was prepared also using a TrpE fusion protein containing codons 502–675. Full-length FER cDNA was isolated from a human foreskin fibroblast cDNA library (CLONTECH) using as probe a polymerase chain reaction fragment that encompasses codons 149–332. A single lysine to arginine mutation was introduced at codon 591, using the SculptorTM in vitro mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Both the wild-type and K591R mutant cDNA sequences were subcloned in a CMV-based eukaryotic expression vector to yield pCMV-HA-FER(WT) and pCMV-HA-FER(K591R). The subcloning was designed to introduce an influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at the amino terminus of the FER sequences. The human CSF-1 receptor cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. C. Sherr of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at St. Jude's Medical Center and was subcloned into the CMV expression vector to yield pCMV-CSF1R. Details of the subcloning procedures will be provided upon request. Confluent cultures of NIH3T3 cells were serum-starved and stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) as described before (10Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS and scraped into ice-cold hypotonic buffer (20 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.7, 15 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 40 μm ammonium molybdate) (1 ml/10-cm plate). The cell suspension was allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, and cell lysis was achieved by homogenization in a tight-fitting glass homogenizer. The cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged for 90 min at 100,000 ×g to yield an S100 supernatant. The pelleted material was resuspended by homogenization in 3 ml of buffer that contained 5% glycerol, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 40 mm ammonium molybdate. To that suspension was added 10% Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1%. The mixture was clarified by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 10 min) to yield a solubilized membrane (P100) fraction. Protein concentrations were determined using the microBCA reagents (Pierce). Whole-cell lysates were prepared as described previously (10Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed as described before, using typically 300 μg of S100 and 30 μg of P100 fractions and 5 μg of purified antibodies or 5 μl of antisera (10Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed using standard techniques, and binding was detected with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immune complex kinase assays, whole-cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with FER5 antiserum, and kinase assays were performed as described before (10Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Preparation of GST fusion proteins and in vitro binding assays were performed as described before (10Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In binding assays that involved GST-CCD, the detection of cortactin required an intermediate immunoprecipitation, because the GST-CCD polypeptide comigrates with cortactin on SDS gels and prohibits the unambiguous detection of cortactin. In those experiments, proteins bound to immobilized GST fusion proteins were eluted by boiling in 1% SDS. The samples were diluted with 1% Triton X-100 to bring the final SDS concentration to 0.2%. The eluted materials were then immunoprecipitated with anti-cortactin antibody before analyses by Western blotting. GST pull-down experiments in denaturing conditions were performed by first immunoprecipitating S100 fractions with 5 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The immunoprecipitates were denatured by boiling in SDS and diluted with 1% Triton X-100 as above. The immunoprecipitated proteins were then incubated with GST fusion proteins immobilized on Sepharose beads, and bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. NIH3T3 cells were seeded on glass coverslips and were serum-starved before treatment with PDGF for 5 min. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (room temperature for 5 min) and were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min). Following blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS, cells were stained with FER5 antiserum (1:400) and anti-cortactin mAb 4F11 (1:2000). This was followed by staining with labeled second antibodies and mounting of the coverslips. Cells were examined using an Olympus BH2 microscope and photographed. 293 cells (106 cells) were seeded in 10-cm dishes and were transfected 24 h later using the modified calcium phosphate procedure (24Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Each culture received 2 μg of pCMV-CSF1R in the presence of 14 μg of either pCMV vector, pCMV-HA-FER, or pCMV-HA-FER(K591R). The amounts and ratio of cDNA used were optimized in prior experiments to obtain maximal expression of both CSF-1R and the FER cDNAs. At 14–18 h after transfection, cells were rinsed and fed with fresh culture medium. After another 4–12 h, the culture medium was replaced with starvation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.5% fetal bovine serum and 10 mm Hepes). The cultures were starved overnight and stimulated with M-CSF (100 ng/ml, R & D Systems) for 5 min. Cells were harvested and lysed as described above. We previously used an immunological approach to identify the association of FER with pp120 (10Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To further identify other components that may interact with FER, we prepared additional FER-specific antisera and analyzed their ability to immunoprecipitate FER-containing complexes from lysates of NIH3T3 cells. As shown previously, antiserum FER1 immunoprecipitated a complex of FER and pp120 (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4). PDGF treatment resulted in an increase in the phosphorylation of both FER and pp120. Two other FER-specific antisera, FER2 and FER5, also immunoprecipitated FER, as well as a small amount of the 180-kDa activated PDGF receptor (Fig. 1, lanes 5–8). However, little or no pp120 was co-immunoprecipitated by either of these two antisera. FER5 immunoprecipitated additional polypeptides of 125 kDa and >205 kDa. The identity of these polypeptides has yet to be determined. These anti-FER antisera may therefore recognize distinct subpopulations or conformations of FER. Because many proteins that regulate cell-cell or cell-substrate adhesion are found in detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal structures, the use of detergent lysates may preclude the detection of some FER complexes. We therefore prepared subcellular fractions by hypotonic lysis and verified the fractionation of subcellular components by Western blot analyses. The membrane (P100) fraction showed the expected enrichment of the PDGF receptor, which is the major tyrosine phosphorylated protein in cells treated with PDGF (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4). As shown previously, pp120 is enriched in the P100 fraction (25Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Conversely, FER is localized mostly in the cytosolic (S100) fraction, but a detectable amount is also recovered in the membrane pellet. Other signaling molecules, such as cortactin and dynamin, showed predominantly cytosolic localization but with significant extent of membrane association as well. From the S100 fractions, both FER1 and FER2 antisera immunoprecipitated a doublet of 97 and 102 kDa (Fig. 2 B), of which only the 97-kDa polypeptide cross-reacted with FER antibodies in Western blotting (Fig. 2 C). Antiserum FER2 also immunoprecipitated an 85-kDa phosphorylated polypeptide, which cross-reacted with antibodies to the actin-binding protein cortactin (Fig. 2, B and D). PDGF treatment resulted in an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of FER, the 102-kDa polypeptide, as well as cortactin. In the case of cortactin, there is substantial basal phosphorylation, and the extent of association with FER appears to be insensitive to growth factor treatment. The identity of the 102-kDa polypeptide that co-immunoprecipitated with FER was analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies to signaling molecules of this size range. Antibodies to dynamin cross-reacted with a 102-kDa polypeptide that was specifically co-immunoprecipitated by the FER antisera, but not by nonimmune antibodies (Fig. 2 E). However, the abundance of the dynamin in the FER immunoprecipitates did not correlate with the reactivity to the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (compare lanes 5–8 of B with those in E). As expected from the known localization of pp120, the FER·pp120 complex was enriched in the P100 fraction and was immunoprecipitated by antiserum FER1 (Fig. 2 F). Immunoprecipitates prepared with antiserum FER2 contained a significant amount of cortactin, but only a trace of pp120 (Fig. 2, Gand H). In contrast to the immunoprecipitates prepared with the S100 fractions, the P100 fraction immunoprecipitates did not contain any detectable amount of the 102-kDa phosphoprotein. To further ascertain the FER-cortactin association, the subcellular localization of the two proteins were analyzed by double immunofluorescence staining. In unsynchronized fibroblasts, cortactin was previously shown to colocalize with cortical actin filaments (20Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar,21Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). We found that, in quiescent fibroblasts, cortactin is in the cortex, but a significant amount is also detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3). In these cells, FER is localized primarily in the cytoplasm, although a detectable extent of colocalization with cortactin in the cell cortex can also be observed (A and B). The staining obtained with the FER antiserum was specific, because it was not observed with preimmune serum or if the antiserum was preincubated with the immunogen. In PDGF-treated cells, cortactin becomes enriched in the cell cortex, and colocalization with FER is clearly visible in the membrane ruffles (Fig. 3, C and D). The molecular basis of the FER-cortactin association was further examined in in vitro binding assays. A GST fusion protein containing the SH2 sequence of FER specifically precipitated cortactin from a cytosolic fraction (Fig. 4, A and B). The CCD of FER, which was previously shown to mediate interaction with pp120, did not interact with cortactin. Cortactin is one of the major cytosolic proteins that are subject to PDGF-regulated tyrosine phosphorylation and which bind the FER SH2 sequence in vitro (Fig. 4, C and D). We also tested the ability of the FER SH2 sequence to directly interact with cortactin. Cytosolic proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and denatured. Cortactin was the predominant component that, following denaturation and renaturation, retained the ability to bind the FER SH2 sequence (Fig. 4, E and F). This suggests that the FER SH2 sequence has the capacity to directly interact with cortactin. In addition to cortactin, a 102-kDa polypeptide was found to co-immunoprecipitate with FER from the cytosolic fraction. Although dynamin can be detected in the FER immunoprecipitates, its abundance in the immune complexes suggests that it is distinct from the 102-kDa component detected in the anti-phosphotyrosine Western blots. The identity of the 102-kDa polypeptide was further investigated by dissecting the interactions among the components of the immune complex. The immune complex was isolated using FER2 antiserum and was denatured. The immunoprecipitated polypeptides were then subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation using antiserum FER5, which we found to be able to recognize denatured FER (Fig. 5 C). Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed that the 97–102-kDa doublet was retrieved by immunoprecipitation with FER5 antibodies (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1–4). Cortactin, which was co-immunoprecipitated by FER2, was not found in the FER5 immunoprecipitates, but was recovered in a subsequent immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (lanes 5 and 6). Dynamin, which was present in the original FER2 immunoprecipitates, was not recovered in any of the subsequent re-immunoprecipitations. Furthermore, the dynamin that was co-immunoprecipitated by the FER2 antibodies was not phosphorylated. These results rule out the possibility that dynamin is the 102-kDa phosphoprotein co-immunoprecipitating with FER. They also suggest that the 102-kDa polypeptide is closely related to FER or that its association with FER is mediated by a novel interaction, which is resistant to denaturation. To help analyze the functional implication of the FER-cortactin interaction, we prepared an enzymatically inactive FER by introducing a point mutation in the conserved lysine (Lys591) of the predicted ATP binding site of the kinase. Transient expression of the K591R FER mutant cDNA showed that it encodes a polypeptide that is slightly larger than the endogenous FER kinase, as a result of the addition of an HA epitope tag to the amino terminus (Fig. 6, A and B). In an immune complex kinase assay, the lysate of cells transfected with the K591R mutant showed no autophosphorylation of the mutant FER protein and reduced autophosphorylation of the endogenous kinase (C, lane 6). In contrast, transfection with an analogous wild-type FER cDNA resulted in a significant autophosphorylation of the tagged kinase (C, lane 5). These results suggest that the K591R FER protein may function as a dominant interfering mutant. To assess the effect of the K591R FER mutant on pp120 and cortactin phosphorylation, we cotransfected 293 cells with cDNA encoding CSF-1 receptor and mutant or wild-type FER. It was shown previously that the tyrosine phosphorylation of pp120 and cortactin is also regulated by the CSF-1 receptor (26Downing J.R. Reynolds A.B. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 607-613PubMed Google Scholar). S100 fractions of transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with FER antisera. Antiserum FER1 immunoprecipitated a complex mixture of endogenous and tagged FER proteins, as well as a small amount of pp120 (Fig. 7). Whereas the anti-phosphotyrosine blot revealed the presence of multiple bands of 97–102 kDa in the wild-type FER immunoprecipitates, there was considerably less heterogeneity in the case of cells transfected with the K591R mutant (A and B, lanes 3 and 4). Similarly, the anti-FER2 immunoprecipitates contained a complex mixture of FER proteins and cortactin (lanes 5–8). The anti-phosphotyrosine blot revealed that expression of the K591R FER mutant resulted in a significant reduction in the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin (A, lanes 7 and 8). The effect of the FER mutant on cortactin phosphorylation was further ascertained by analyzing immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-cortactin antibodies. As shown with the FER2 antibodies, immunoprecipitation with anti-cortactin antibodies clearly demonstrated the association of FER and cortactin (Fig. 8 A). In cells co-expressing the CSF-1 receptor and wild-type FER, M-CSF treatment resulted in an increase in phosphorylation of both FER and cortactin (Fig. 8 A, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, expression of the K591R FER mutant resulted in a marked reduction of both basal and factor-dependent phosphorylation of cortactin (lanes 3 and 4). It is noteworthy that the mutant FER did not show any impairment in its association with cortactin. Examination of the FER polypeptides in the anti-cortactin immunoprecipitates clearly shows the mobility differences of the wild-type and mutant FER products. We also further verified the effect of the FER mutant on pp120 phosphorylation by immunoprecipitating P100 fractions using anti-pp120 antibodies. As shown previously, epithelial cells such as 293 cells express a heterogeneous mixture of pp120 isoforms (22Reynolds A.B. Daniel J. McCrea P. Wheelock M.J. Zhang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8333-8342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There was no difference in the extent of pp120 phosphorylation in cells expressing wild-type or K591R mutant FER. We previously demonstrated the stable association of FER with the catenin pp120 and estimated that no more than 10–15% of the total FER protein was involved in that complex (10Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As shown in the subcellular fractionation studies here, that previous estimate is consistent with the abundance of FER that is associated with the membrane fraction. The use of subcellular fractionation and the FER2 antiserum permitted the identification of a novel interaction between FER and the cytoskeletal protein cortactin. Immunoprecipitation of FER resulted in the coprecipitation of either cortactin or pp120, but not both. Thus, FER appears to interact with pp120 and cortactin in a mutually exclusive manner, although binding to the two polypeptides requires distinct FER sequences. These observations suggest that the FER·pp120 and FER-cortactin complexes may be involved in different signaling function. The FER-cortactin complex is detectable in a cytosolic fraction, but not in a lysate prepared using detergent-containing buffers. The association was verified by functional and structural analyses using independent assays and is therefore unlikely to be an artifact of the lysis procedure. The FER-cortactin association is unambiguously demonstrated by immunofluorescence colocalization in the membrane ruffles of PDGF-treated cells. Most significantly, the effect of the FER K591R mutant on cortactin phosphorylation strongly supports a direct physical interaction between the two proteins. We therefore believe that the interaction involves cytoskeletal structures that are detergent insoluble. Our analyses suggest that between 10 and 0% of the cellular cortactin is associated with FER. In addition to cortactin, we identified also a novel 102-kDa polypeptide that co-immunoprecipitated with FER. We recently showed that cortactin interacts with dynamin 2, which has an apparent molecular mass of ∼100 kDa. 2M. McNiven, L. Kim, and T. W. Wong, manuscript in preparation. Our analyses showed that dynamin could be detected in immunoprecipitates prepared with anti-FER antibodies, presumably by virtue of the interaction of FER with cortactin. However, the results also clearly showed that the 102-kDa polypeptide is distinct from dynamin. The ability of the FER5 antiserum to recover both the 97-kDa FER and the 102-kDa polypeptide under denaturing conditions suggests that the latter is a highly modified form of FER or a closely related polypeptide. As is evident in the transient expression assays, there is a pronounced size heterogeneity in the cytosolic pool of wild-type FER protein. The fact that the size heterogeneity is absent in the case of the FER mutant suggests that it is dependent on FER kinase activity. It therefore seems plausible that the 102-kDa polypeptide may be a highly phosphorylated form of FER that is present in such low abundance as to be undetectable by Western blotting with anti-FER antibodies. The functional significance of this polypeptide, and its selective localization in the cytosol, remain to be investigated further. In vitro binding assays demonstrated that the SH2 sequence of FER is capable of directly binding cortactin. This contrasts with our previous finding that the coiled coil sequence at the amino terminus of FER is required for binding pp120 (10Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Expression of the FER K591R mutant was found to result in an inhibition of the autophosphorylation of the endogenous FER kinase, thus suggesting that the mutant was capable of functioning in a dominant interfering manner. The FER mutation has no apparent effect on its ability to interact with cortactin and pp120, and expression of the FER mutant has no effect on the expression of the two cytoskeletal proteins (data not shown). The mutation did result in an inhibition of the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin, but not of pp120, in response to growth factor receptor signaling. These data argue that cortactin, but not pp120, is a direct substrate of FER kinase. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that a residual amount of endogenous FER activity is sufficient to effect the phosphorylation of pp120. It should be noted that we have never been able to demonstrate a direct binding between FER and pp120. Recently, peptide libraries were used to determine the substrate specificity of protein tyrosine kinases (27Songyang Z. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Such analyses led to the conclusion that nonreceptor tyrosine kinases tend to phosphorylate peptide sequences that are recognized by their SH2 domains. Our observations on the FER-cortactin interaction and their putative enzyme-substrate relationship would be consistent with the specificity proposed on the basis of the peptide substrate analyses. Most significantly, our data suggest that the regulation of cortactin phosphorylation by growth factor receptors may be mediated in part by FER. Although cortactin was originally identified as a target of tyrosine phosphorylation by v-Src, a role for c-Src in cortactin phosphorylation has not been established. The subcellular localization of c-Src to endosomal membranes suggests that c-Src and cortactin are localized to different cellular compartments (28Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Varmus H.E. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In addition to v-Src and FER, the cytoplasmic kinase FYN has also been implicated in the regulation of cortactin phosphorylation (29Calautti E. Missero C. Stein P.L. Ezzell R.M. Dotto G.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2279-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is therefore plausible that cortactin may be a substrate of multiple tyrosine kinases that serve to relay different extracellular signals. The significant basal phosphorylation of cortactin may be carried out by an unidentified tyrosine kinase. The partial phosphorylation allows cortactin to bind FER, and the FER-cortactin complex becomes a subject of regulation by growth factor signaling. The localization of cortactin to the cortical cytoskeleton, and its affinity for filamentous actin, led to the suggestion that cortactin may be involved in transmitting signals from the membrane to the actin cytoskeleton. That proposal is further substantiated by the observation that cortactin phosphorylation is induced upon integrin signaling in cell adhesion and in the cytoskeletal reorganization that accompanies bacterial entry of epithelial cells (30Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 31Dehio C. Prevost M.-C. Sansonetti P.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2471-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Recently, cortactin was shown to cross-link F-actin in vitro, and the cross-linking activity was down-regulated by the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin (32Huang C. Ni Y. Wang T. Gao Y. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These observations have consolidated a role for and FER and cortactin in the transmission of signals for reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. We thank Dr. M.

Fet3p is proposed to facilitate iron uptake by catalyzing the oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) by O2; in this model, Fe(III) is the substrate for the iron permease, encoded by FTR1. Here, a recombinant Fet3p has been produced in yeast that, lacking the C-terminal membrane-spanning domain, is secreted directly into the growth medium. Solutions of this Fet3p at >1 mg/ml have the characteristic blue color of a type 1 Cu(II)-containing protein, consistent with the sequence homology that placed this protein in the class of multinuclear copper oxidases that includes ceruloplasmin. Fet3p has an intense absorption at 607 nm (ε = 5500 m−1 cm−1) due to this type 1 Cu(II) and a shoulder in the near UV at 330 nm (ε = 5000m−1 cm−1) characteristic of a type 3 binuclear Cu(II) cluster. The EPR spectrum of this Fet3p showed the presence of one type 1 Cu(II) and one type 2 Cu(II) (A∥ = 91 and 190 × 10−4cm−1, respectively). Copper analysis showed this protein to have 3.85 g atom copper/mol, consistent with the presence of one each of the three types of Cu(II) sites found in multinuclear copper oxidases.

It is a member of the class of enzymes known as multinuclear copper oxidases that includes laccase (Lac) and ascorbate oxidase (AO) in addition to Cp (4Malmström B.G. Annu. Rev.

These include a type 1 or “blue” Cu(II) that, due its strong Cys-S π to Cu2+ d x 2−y 2charge transfer adsorption at ∼600 nm (ε = 4–6,000m−1 cm−1), imparts the characteristic blue color to these proteins; a type 2 Cu(II) that exhibits the weak d-d transition(s) typical of tetragonal Cu(II); and a type 3 binuclear Cu(II) pair that are strongly antiferromagnetically coupled and therefore EPR-silent (6Solomon E.I.

These three enzymes catalyze the four-electron reduction of dioxygen using a variety of one electron substrates (e.g. dimethylphenylenediamine, o-dianisidine, dihydroascorbic acid). Cp is apparently unique in this class in using Fe(II) as substrate, thus also catalyzing what is referred to as the ferroxidase reaction as shown in Reaction 1. Indeed, hCp is relatively specific for Fe(II) (10Osaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5053-5059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Osaki S. Walaas O. J. Biol.

Selin-Lindgren E. Yoshida K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 454-463Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This site is likely to be the site of electron transfer from Fe(II) to the protein at the type 1 Cu(II),i.e. the ferroxidase site. An adjoining site for Fe(III) has also been described in hCp; it is thought that the Fe(III) in this “holding” site is subsequently transferred to serum transferrin (3Lindley P. Card G. Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V.N. Reinhammar B. Selin-Lindgren E. Yoshida K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 454-463Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar,12Osaki S. Johnson D.A. Frieden E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2746-2751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This coupling of the ferroxidase activity of hCp to its iron-binding sites suggests a molecular basis for the link between Cp and iron homeostasis in mammals, i.e. in the plasma, Cp catalyzes the oxidation of Fe(II) released from both erythrocytes and other cell types so that the resulting Fe(III) can be bound by transferrin, thus suppressing the level of “free” Fe(II) in the circulation (12Osaki S. Johnson D.A. Frieden E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2746-2751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chidambaram M.V. Barnes G. Frieden E. FEBS Lett. 1983; 159: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The correlation between the absence of serum hCp (and its ferroxidase activity) and lipid peroxidation on the one hand (14Miyajima H. Takahashi Y. Serizawa M. Kaneko E. Gitlin J.D. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and cellular degeneration in the substantia nigra on the other (15Okamoto N. Wada S. Oga T. Kawabata Y. Baba Y. Habu D. Takeda Z. Wada Y. Hum. Genet. 1996; 97: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 16Nakano M. Eur. Neurol. 1993; 33: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), is consistent with this suggestion. The prooxidant activity of Fe(II) in biologic systems is well documented (17Gutteridge J.M.C. Halliwell B. Hersko C. Iron Chelating Therapy. 2. 1989: 195-256Google Scholar). Recently, a new potential member of this class of copper proteins has been described in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Fet3 protein (18Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 19de Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Eide D. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14208-14213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The FET3 gene was cloned as a result of complementation of an iron uptake deficiency in this organism (18Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). It encodes a protein of 636 amino acid residues with a predicted mass of 72.4 kDa. Analysis of the encoded protein suggests that Fet3p has three important structural features: 1) a single transmembrane-spanning domain included in residues 559–586 indicating that Fet3p is a type 1 membrane protein; 2) 13 potential N-glycosylation sites; 3) and, most importantly, regions of strong homology to the multinuclear copper oxidases in the regions of those proteins that are directly involved in the binding of the catalytic Cu(II) prosthetic groups. Thus, alignment of the predicted Fet3p sequence with the sequences of hCp, AO, and Lac shows that Fet3p very likely has one each of the three types of copper sites found in biology as are found in the other members of this class of cuproproteins. Fet3p is essential to iron uptake in yeast in two complementary ways. First, Fet3 protein is required for the correct targeting of the putative iron permease, the Ftr1 protein, to the plasma membrane. Deletion of the FET3 gene results in the intracellular accumulation of Ftr1p (22Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). These and other data indicate that Ftr1p and Fet3p comprise a protein complex in the yeast plasma membrane. Second, active Fet3 protein is required for iron uptake in that copper-deficient cells lack high affinity iron uptake and this defect can be linked directly to the inactivity of the Fet3p in the plasma membrane. Addition of copper to these membranes restores the oxidase activity of Fet3p that can be measured in vitro (20Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Fet3p does have ferroxidase activity (21de Silva D. Davis-Kaplan S. Fergestad J. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14208-14213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, although not tested by experiment, the current model of high affinity iron uptake is that the Fe(III) generated in the ferroxidase reaction catalyzed by Fet3p is tightly linked to translocation of the metal ion across the plasma membrane by the iron permease, Ftr1p (20Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 22Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y.

Microbiol. 1996; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). That both Fet3p and hCp possess a ferroxidase activity that is essential to their roles in iron homeostasis in yeast and humans, respectively, suggests that delineation of the yeast system, and, in particular, the structure-function relationships in Fet3p, would contribute significantly to our understanding of this apparent conservation of mechanism in regards to iron trafficking in these two eukaryotes. Here, we report the essential structural and kinetic features of a recombinant, soluble form of Fet3p that demonstrate unequivocally that it is a multinuclear copper oxidase. Furthermore, using appropriate steady-state kinetic approaches, we have obtained a complete set of kinetic constants for the catalysis of the ferroxidase reaction by this Fet3 protein. Strain M2* carrying plasmid pDY148 was used as the expression system for the production of soluble Fet3p. Strain M2* is MATαtrp1–63 leu2–3,112 gcn4–101 his3–609 ura3–52 AFT1–1 up (24Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The AFT1–1 upallele encodes a dominant, gain of function mutant of the Aft1 protein, the transactivator of the genes of the iron regulon, includingFET3 (25Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Plasmid pDY148 is a 2μ vector that carries a recombinant FET3 effectively truncated at nucleotide +1666 (at amino acid residue 555, below). To construct pDY148, the wild typeFET3 locus in multi-copy plasmid Yep352 (26Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar) was digested with AgeI (5′ of the transmembrane domain) and PmlI (3′ of the transmembrane domain). The new, truncated 3′ end was ligated to an annealed double-stranded oligonucleotide, which encoded the FLAG epitope (27Brizzard B.L. Chubet R.G. Vizard D.L. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 730-735PubMed Google Scholar), to give the following product (originalFET3 bases in uppercase, synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide in lowercase, with reading frame indicated by spaces).

This construct, which was verified by DNA sequencing, included the FET3 promoter so in strain M2*, the expression of this Fet3 protein was constitutively high and independent of medium iron concentration (24Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 25Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). For production of Fet3p, the transformant strain was grown in a complete synthetic medium (minus Ura for plasmid selection) that contained 200 μm CuSO4. The additional copper ensured that sufficient copper was available for Fet3p. This medium was buffered with 50 mm Tris acetate at an initial pH = 6.5 and contained 4% glucose. These two conditions were chosen to suppress the acidification of the medium that occurred as the culture entered stationary phase (final culture pH ≈ 6). A typical protein preparation started with 10 liters of culture. When the culture reached an A 660 nm = 10–12 (achieved after 18 h of growth), the cells were removed by centrifugation (15 min at 5,000 × g) and the medium was further clarified by filtration through a 0.8-μm cellulose filter (47 mm, MSI) using suction. The clarified medium was then passed through a 5-cm diameter monoQ column (bed volume, 50 ml) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm MES, pH 6.0; the flow rate was ∼1 liter/h. At this ionic strength, medium and column pH, and flow rate, this column had sufficient capacity to bind all of the Fet3 protein contained in 10 liters of medium (∼50 mg). Medium lacking the Tris acetate as buffer and the additional glucose had a final pH < 5, at which pH the binding of Fet3p was inefficient; the pI of the Fet3p is ∼4.6 based on its predicted sequence (18Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). This binding was carried out at 4 °C and typically took 12–16 h (overnight). The column was washed with 1 liter of the MES buffer, and the adsorbed protein was then batch eluted with MES that contained 300 mm NaCl. The fractions containing Fet3p were determined by a standard oxidase assay usingo-dianisidine as substrate (28Schosinsky K.H. Lehmann H.P. Beeler M.F. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 1556-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar); the Fet3p eluted after one bed volume and was collected in a total of ∼40 ml. This solution was diluted with water to 1 liter and applied to a 4-ml monoQ column equilibrated with the same binding MES buffer. The bound protein was eluted as above and collected in ∼6 ml. This solution contained Fet3p that was >90% pure by SDS-PAGE where it migrated in a diffuse band as a species of mass ≈120 kDa (Fig. 1), that was a deep blue in color (Fig. 2), and that exhibited a strong visible absorbance at 607 nm with a A 277/A 607 = 21 ± 1 (cf. Fig. 3). The purity of this preparation was indicated also by the fact that this ratio, which measures the relative amount of the “blue” type 1 Cu(II) in the Fet3p preparation, did not change appreciably following the subsequent chromatographic steps (below).Figure 2Fet3p is a blue Cu(II) protein. The eluate (6.5 ml) from the second monoQ column (see Fig. 1, lane 1) was photographed and the image subsequently digitized prior to reproduction. The protein concentration of this sample was 7.7 mg of protein/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3UV-visible spectrum of soluble, recombinant Fet3 protein. The spectra were recorded at room temperature on Endo H-treated Fet3 (followed by re-chromatography on monoQ) in MES buffer, pH = 6.0. For the visible and near-UV spectrum, the [Fet3] = 123 μm (20X); for the UV spectrum, this sample was diluted to [Fet3] = 6.2 μm (1X). TheA 278 nm/A 607 nm = 21.5 ± 0.5; for hCp, this value is 22 (12Osaki S. Johnson D.A. Frieden E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2746-2751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To this solution was added 5,000 units of Endo H (New England BioLabs); this mixture was incubated at 23 °C for 5 h, at which time SDS-PAGE analysis showed that all of the 120-kDa material was converted to a species that migrated as an 85-kDa polypeptide. This treatment had no effect on the visible absorbance spectrum or activity; on the other hand, treatment at 30 °C resulted in some loss of both even at shorter incubation times. This mixture was dialyzed at 4 °C against the 50 mm MES buffer and was then reapplied to the 4-ml monoQ column from which it was eluted as above to remove the Endo H (as shown by SDS-PAGE) and the digested carbohydrate. This preparation was >95% pure (Fig. 1). Protein concentration was determined by two independent assays, a standard dye-binding one (Bradford) (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211925) Google Scholar) and a redox-based one (copper/biocinchoninic acid) (30Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

Reducing sugar was determined by the acid-anthrone method (31Dische Z. Carb. Chem. 1962; 1: 479-490Google Scholar). Standard Edman degradation and carboxypeptidase methods were used for the N- and C-terminal analyses, respectively. For the latter, seven times points were taken followed by amino acid analysis of the digestion mixture. Electrospray mass spectral analysis was performed on a VG/Fisons QuatroII spectrometer. The protein was desalted on a Sep Pak C18 cartridge prior to injection. The mass peak was picked and assigned from a transform of the raw data of ion intensity versus m/z using an algorithm named “Max Entropy” (32Green B. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 6: 707-711Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Copper was determined by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry (fAAS) on a Perkin Elmer model 1100 instrument equipped with a model 700 graphite furnace. Absorbance spectra were recorded on a Beckman model 620B instrument at room temperature. EPR spectra were obtained at 77 and 20 K on a Bruker model 300E spectrometer operating at 9.5 GHz (X-band). Fe(II) oxidation to Fe(III) (the ferroxidase reaction) was followed spectrophotometrically at 315 nm (Δε = 2200 m−1 cm−1) (33Bonomi F. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Cui X. J. Inorg. Biol. Chem. 1996; 1: 67-72Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Oxygen uptake was recorded using input from a YSI model 53 O2 electrode system and a scale expansion that enabled measurement of [O2] down to 1 μm with 10% precision and to 0.2 μm with 20% precision. Control experiments were performed to assess the relative rates of O2 leakage into the system and consumption of O2 by the electrode versus the rate of O2 consumption by the ferroxidase reaction. Sufficient Fet3p was used to ensure that neither of the former two rates significantly affected the values obtained for the latter process. The data from both kinetic experiments were analyzed using the integrated form of the Michaelis-Menten equation, which allows for the determination of V max and K mvalues from a single reaction progress curve (34Segel I. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley-Interscience, New York1975: 54-57Google Scholar). The fit of the raw data to this equation was obtained by linear-least squares using the appropriate algorithm in the program CricketGraph (Cricket Software, Malvern, PA). The native Fet3 protein contains a probable transmembrane domain that could consist of residues 559–586 (18Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 22Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). This structural assignment was used to design a recombinant form of Fet3p truncated following residue Gly-555, with a C-terminal FLAG epitope appended at that point for future immunologic detection and manipulation. That the resulting protein was secreted into the growth medium was consistent with this structure assignment. Furthermore, preliminary experiments demonstrated that this secreted protein exhibited an o-dianisidine oxidase activity that was dependent on the presence of a functional Ccc2 protein. 2D. S. Yuan, unpublished results. Ccc2 is an apparent copper-dependent ATPase that is required for supplying copper for the activation of Fet3p within a compartment of the secretory pathway, most likely a late or post-Golgi one (20Yuan D.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25787-25793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This Ccc2 dependence indicated that this soluble form of Fet3p was processed in an equivalent fashion to the native, membrane-bound protein. The purification of this recombinant, soluble Fet3p from 10 liters of growth medium was accomplished in less than 2 days (see “Materials and Methods”). The adsorption of Fet3p from the growth medium by passage over a bed of monoQ was accomplished overnight. The protein was then eluted in batch by high salt, and the eluate diluted to lower the ionic strength and re-bound to a small monoQ column. It was again batch-eluted to concentrate the protein sample. SDS-PAGE analysis showed this material to be nearly homogenous with respect to Fet3p, which appeared as a broad band of ∼120 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 1) as has been described for native Fet3p (20Yuan D.S.

The heterogeneity of this material was undoubtedly due to a variable molecular carbohydrate content; Fet3p has 13 potential N-linked glycosylation sites (18Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S.

This sample (∼6 ml total volume from 10 liter of culture) was a crystal blue in appearance (Fig. 2) and exhibited a strong associated visible absorbance at 607 nm (cf., Fig. 3). A shoulder at ∼330 nm in the near UV portion of the spectrum was also apparent; this absorption was nearly equivalent in intensity to the one at 607 nm (Fig. 3). Treatment of this sample with Endo H resulted in (some) trimming of the high mannose core of the presumably N-linked carbohydrate to yield a species that migrated with an apparent mass of 85 kDa. This material appeared significantly more homogenous with respect to molecular mass based on the Coomassie-stained gel (Fig. 1, lane 2). This (partially, see below) deglycosylated protein exhibited essentially the same visible absorbance as did its precursor (data not shown); both preparations had anA 278/A 607 = 21.5 ± 0.5 (Fig. 3). For reference, this ratio for human ceruloplasmin is 22 (12Osaki S. Johnson D.A. Frieden E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2746-2751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Endo H-treated sample was then adsorbed to and eluted from a third monoQ column to remove the Endo H and released carbohydrate. The final preparation appeared >95% pure by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, lane 2). The yield from a 10-liter culture was ∼40 mg of protein based on two independent protein assays (see “Materials and Methods”). Over 80% of the oxidase activity in the growth medium was recovered; the specific oxidase activity of this recombinant Fet3p was 3.0 μmol/min/mg of protein with o-dianisidine as substrate in a standard assay (28Schosinsky K.H. Lehmann H.P. Beeler M.F. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 1556-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). A commercial preparation of porcine ceruloplasmin (Sigma) had a specific activity of 0.3 μmol/min/mg of protein. Based on the nucleotide sequence of the FET3gene, the predicted amino acid sequence for Fet3 protein includes an N-terminal hydrophobic leader motif that would be cleaved following targeting to the secretory pathway (18Askwith C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25787-25793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In confirmation of this prediction, the N-terminal sequence of the soluble Fet3p was determined by Edman analysis to be H2N-ETHTF-. The yield at each cycle was nearly quantitative with respect to the amount of protein used, indicating the essential purity of the preparation insofar as polypeptide content was concerned. This N-terminal sequence indicates that the proteolytic processing occurs following Ala-21 in the primary translation product (18Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The C-terminal sequence of this FLAG epitope-tagged recombinant protein was determined also to ensure that translation termination occurred appropriately at the engineered stop codons.

The ICE/CED-3-related1proteases or caspases play important roles in cytokine activation and apoptosis (1Cohen G.M. Biochem.

They introduce one or a few strategic cuts in a variety of key cellular proteins, resulting either in the activation or inhibition of cellular functions (2Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 8: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2181) Google Scholar). Caspase-1 (ICE) is one of the few caspases with characterized activities both in the cleavage activation of proinflammatory cytokines and in apoptosis (1Cohen G.M. Biochem.

Although caspase-1 is not required for programmed cell death during mammalian development (7Kuida K. Lippke J.A. Ku G. Harding M.W. Livingston D.J. Su M.S.-S. Flavell R.A. Science. 1995; 267: 2000-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar), its activation is associated with apoptosis in mammary gland epithelial cells, interferon-γ-treated HeLa and A431 cells, and HeLa cells treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (3Boudreau N.

Caspase-1 also plays a role during interleukin-1β-mediated apoptosis and may be crucial in untimely neuronal cell deaths (8Friedlander R.M. Gagliardini V. Rotello R.J. Yuan J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 9Friedlander R.M. Gagliardini V. Hara H. Fink K.B. Li W. MacDonald G. Fishman M.C. Greenberg A.H. Moskowitz M.A. Yuan J. J. Exp.

A. 1996; 93: 5635-5640Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Caspase-1 is initially synthesized as a single inactive polypeptide zymogen comprising p20 and p10 subunits connected to a long N-terminal prodomain of 119 amino acids, which is cleaved off before or during the formation of the active protease tetramer (p20/p10)2 (1Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4132) Google Scholar,2Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 8: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2181) Google Scholar). It has been assumed that the prodomain functions either to prevent premature protease activation or to participate in the complex process of cis and trans cleavages at internal Asp residues, the release of the p20 and p10 subunits, and their realignment to form the active tetramer (1Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4132) Google Scholar, 11Gu Y. Wu J. Faucheu C. Lalanne J.-L. Diu A. Livingston D.J. Su M.S.-S.

Convincing experimental evidence for the participation of the prodomain in these events is, however, lacking. Overexpression of some pro-caspases triggers apoptosis, supporting a role for the prodomain in protease activation (1Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4132) Google Scholar). Apoptosis mediated by caspase-8 requires a region in its long prodomain termed the death effector domain (DED) (13Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of caspase-7 lacking the short prodomain causes apoptosis, whereas expression of pro-caspase-7 does not, implying that its prodomain may play a role in silencing the precursor (14Duan H. Chinnaiyan A.M. Hudson P.L. Wing J.P. He W.W. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1621-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Cellular localization of caspases could be an important determinant of their activation, substrate specificity, and the ultimate cellular response, but this has not been studied until recently (15Chandler J.M. Cohen G.M. MacFarlane M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10815-10818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that a cell death stimulus induces the translocation of pro-caspase-1 to the nucleus, where release of its prodomain and proteolytic activation occur in parallel with apoptosis. The nuclear targeting of pro-caspase-1 critically depends on a nuclear localization signal in its prodomain. Human 293T, MCF-7, and HeLa D98 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HeLa D98 cells were grown to 70% confluency, and the cells were treated with 20 ng/ml TNF and 10 μg/ml of CHX. Recombinant human TNF was fromCLONTECH. p45-ICE polyclonal and agarose-conjugated Myc tag monoclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz. Agarose-conjugated and FLAG M2 antibodies were from Kodak. The hemagglutinin tag polyclonal antibody was from Medical and Biological Laboratories (Nagoya, Japan), and the Myc tag polyclonal antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology. Genomic DNA was isolated using the Blood and Cell Culture Mini DNA kit (Qiagen) and analyzed in a 1.5% agarose gel. The ICE/lacZ plasmid was provided by Junying Yuan. The p45-ICE, p30-ICE, p20-ICE, p10-ICE, Pro-L, and Pro-S cDNAs were obtained by PCR. Mutations were either made in p45-ICE cDNA, giving rise to p45-ICE-C285S (Cys285 converted to Ser), p45-ICE-K7T/K9T/K11T and p45-ICE-K53T/R55T; or made in the prodomain (Pro-L) construct, giving Pro-K7T/K9T/K11T, Pro-K7T/K9T, Pro-K7T/K11T, K9T/K11T, Pro-K7T, Pro-K9T, and Pro-K11T. These mutants were generated by PCR using four sets of oligonucleotides (16Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). The upstream primer 1 corresponding to sequences in the upper strand encoded an artificial EcoRI site upstream of primer 1. The downstream primer 2 corresponding to sequences in the lower strand encoded an in-frame stop codon followed by an artificial SalI site. For each mutant, a set of two complementary primers harboring the selected base alteration was synthesized termed primer 3 (upper strand) and primer 4 (lower strand). Two PCR reactions were set up, one of which used primers 1 plus 4; the other used primers 2 plus 3. The resulting PCR fragments were purified and combined then used as a template for a second round of PCR amplification using primers 1 and 2. The primers for p45-ICE and its subunits were as described (17Thornberry N.A. et al.Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). The primers (mutated nucleotide underlined) for p45-ICE-C285S were: 1, ATG GCC GAC AAG GTC; 2, TTA ATG TCC TGG GAA G; 3, TCA TCC AGG CTA GCC GTG G; and 4, CCA CGG CTA GCC TGG ATG A. The primers for p45-ICE-K7T/K9T/K11T were: 1, ATG GCC GAC AAG GTC CTG ACG GAG ACG AGA ACG CTG; and 2, TTA ATG TCC TGG GAA G. The primers for p45-ICE-K53T/R55T were: 1, ATG GCC GAC AAG GTC; 2, TTA ATG TCC TGG GAA G; 3, ATG GAT ACG ACC ACA GCT TTG ATT; and 4, AAT CAA AGC TGT GGT CGT ATC CAT. The primers for Pro-K7T/K9T/K11T were: 1, ATG GCC GAC AAG GTC CTG ACG GAG ACG AGA ACG CTG; and 2, TTA GTC CTG CAC TGC. The amplified fragments were subcloned into tagged pcDNA3. Three epitope tags were used: Myc tag (AEEQKLISEEDLLRK), hemagglutinin tag (YPYDVPDYASL), and FLAG tag (MDYKDDDK). The upstream region of each synthetic epitope sequence (GGG AA GGATCC ACCATG [tag sequence] GAA TTC AAG CTT) encoded aBamHI restriction site (underlined) and an artificial initiator methionine (italics), and downstream of each tag sequences was an EcoRI site (boldface type). The plus and minus strands of each tag sequence were annealed, and the double-stranded tag sequences were then cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pcDNA3. Each PCR-generated caspase-1 mutant cDNA digested with EcoRI and SalI was subcloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of tagged pcDNA3. Cell lysates were prepared and separated into nuclear and cytosolic fractions (18Mao P.-L. Beauchemin M. Bédard P.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8131-8139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Washed, pelleted cells (1–7 × 106) were suspended in 200 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 μg/ml of leupeptin, aprotinin, and antipain. The cells were homogenized gently in a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation at 600 × g, the resultant pellets (nuclear fraction) and the supernatants (cytosolic fraction) were further prepared as follows: the supernatants were further centrifuged at 130,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove the debris. The resulting supernatants were used as the soluble cytosolic fraction. The pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 420 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml of protease inhibitors and then lysed at 4 °C for 30 min with vigorous rotation. Then the lysed mix was centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected as the nuclear fraction (18Mao P.-L. Beauchemin M. Bédard P.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8131-8139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfections of 293T and MCF-7 cells were performed using Tfx-20 reagent (Promega). Cells were harvested 30 h following transfection. For immunoprecipitation, cytosolic or nuclear proteins were incubated with 2 μg of agarose-conjugated Myc or FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies overnight at 4 °C, and then 30 μl of agarose-conjugated protein A+G (Calbiochem) was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium desoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western immunoblotting. HeLa D98 cells express cytosolic but not nuclear pro-caspase-1 (p45-ICE) as shown by Western blotting using an antibody raised against the prodomain of caspase-1 that recognizes both pro-caspase-1 and its prodomain (Fig. 1,upper panels). HeLa D98 cells were incubated with TNF and CHX, which induce apoptosis and caspase-1 activation within hours (Fig. 1 B, lower panel) (4Miura M. Friedlander R.M. Yuan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 88318-88322Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 19Jänicke R.U. Lee F.H. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5661-5670Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). At different times after TNF/CHX treatment, the same antibody detected not only cytosolic but also a substantial amount of nuclear pro-caspase-1 at 1 h, as well as the appearance of the intact 11.5-kDa prodomain of caspase-1 in the nucleus at 1–3 h (Fig. 1). A decline in nuclear pro-caspase-1 and an increase in the level of its prodomain in the nucleus coincided with a marked enhancement in the proportion of apoptotic cells (Fig. 1 B). Proteolytic activation of caspase-1 is assumed to occur in the nucleus as judged by a reduction in the amount of nuclear pro-caspase-1 over time and by the removal of the prodomain (Fig. 1 B), a critical step in the activation of this protease (20Yamin T.-T. Ayala J.M. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13273-13282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In contrast, cytosolic activation of pro-caspase-1 was undetectable either using the antibody directed against the prodomain (Fig. 1 A) or using a different antibody that recognizes the p20 subunit of mature processed caspase-1 (data not shown). To determine whether the prodomain or the protease domain (representing the joined p20 and p10 subunits) has a NLS, the prodomain (Pro-L) and the protease domain of caspase-1 (p30-ICE) (see Fig. 3) were separately transfected and expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. Whereas Myc-tagged p30-ICE was located exclusively in the cytosol, Myc- or FLAG-tagged Pro-L was translocated to the nucleus (Fig. 2 A). Pro-S (Pro-L lacking 16 C-terminal amino acids) was also constructed (Fig. 3), because processing of pro-caspase-1 led to the formation of p20-ICE (lacking Pro-L) and p22-ICE from which Pro-S was presumably removed. Pro-S (Myc-Pro-S) was also efficiently translocated to the nucleus in 293T cells (Fig. 2 A, middle panel). Estimation of the sizes of Pro-L and Pro-S suggests that Pro-S (11.5-kDa) is the endogenously cleaved prodomain in TNF/CHX-treated HeLa cells (Fig. 1 B).Figure 2Western blot analysis of nuclear translocation of p45-ICE, its prodomain, and different tagged mutants. 293T cells were transiently transfected with different cDNAs encoding Myc- or FLAG-tagged proteins as indicated (see also the legend of Fig. 3 for descriptions). The vector controls are Myc-pcDNA3 and FLAG-pcDNA3. A, cytosolic (lanes C) and nuclear (lanes N) extracts of cells transfected with tagged prodomains or p30-ICE were isolated and immunoprecipitated by FLAG M2 or Myc epitope-specific antibodies.

Thearrows indicate the corresponding proteins recognized by each individually tagged antibody. B, specific amino acid substitutions in the putative nuclear localization signal of pro-caspase-1 (p45-ICE) prevent its nuclear localization.

Statuto M. Ragnotti G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1845-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Wessendorf J, M. Garfinkel S. Zhan X. Brown S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22100-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, full-length pro-caspase-1 (p45-ICE) and mutant p45-ICE molecules with amino acid substitutions in this (or a neighboring) Lys/Arg-rich segment in Pro-L (Lys53–Arg55) were transiently transfected and expressed in 293T cells. Mutations in the N-terminal amino acids Lys7, Lys9, and Lys11 (FLAG-p45-ICE-K7T/K9T/K11T) but not in Lys53 and Arg55 (FLAG-p45-ICE-K53T/R55T) blocked the nuclear translocation of pro-caspase-1 (Fig. 2 B). The same K7T/K9T/K11T mutations (FLAG-Pro-K7T/K9T/K11T) also blocked nuclear translocation of the prodomain alone, confirming that this region of the prodomain acts as a NLS (Fig. 2 A, middle panel). To determine the relative contributions of Lys7, Lys9, and Lys11 to the function of the NLS, all possible combinations of Pro-L mutants with changes in these positions were constructed. All prodomains with mutations in Lys9were exclusively cytosolic, demonstrating the functional importance of Lys9 in nuclear targeting (Fig. 4). Pro-K7T and Pro-K11T were located in both the cytosol and nucleus, as was Pro-K7T/K11T, indicating that lysines at these positions are not essential for nuclear targeting of pro-caspase-1 (Fig. 4). Transfection of caspase-1 into HeLa cells has previously been shown to efficiently induce their apoptosis (4Miura M. Friedlander R.M. Yuan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 88318-88322Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In agreement with these findings, Pro-caspase-1 (p45-ICE) induced apoptosis efficiently when transfected and expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 5 B) and in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5 C). The apoptotic effect in MCF-7 cells was specific because neither p45-ICE with a point mutation in the active site cysteine (p45-ICE-C285S) nor the individual p20 or p10 subunits induced detectable apoptosis (Fig. 5 C). Surprisingly, ectopic expression of Pro-L or Pro-S in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5 C) or in 293T cells (Fig. 5 B) induced cell death as efficiently as p45-ICE. Prodomain-transfected cells displayed morphological alterations typical of cells undergoing apoptosis, becoming rounded and shrunken before detaching from the plastic surface. In 293T cells, TUNEL assays (Fig. 5 A), detection of cellular DNA fragmentation on agarose gels (Fig. 5 D), and annexin V and propidium iodide staining (Fig. 5 B) all strongly suggested that the mode of cell death was apoptosis. Flow cytometry analysis of annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled 293T cells showed that following their transfection with Myc-Pro-L or Myc-Pro-S, 54.04 or 66.54% of cells were stained positive for externalized phosphatidylserine (PS), and 22.15 or 25.05%, respectively, of the cells had reached the late stage of apoptosis (Fig. 5 B). We have shown that both endogenous and exogenously expressed pro-caspase-1 translocates to the nucleus. Recent evidence also revealed that endogenous caspase-1 was present in both the cytosol and nuclei of human neuroblastoma cells (23Nakagawara A. Nakamura Y. Ikeda H. Hiwasa T. Kuida K. Su M.S.-S. Zhao H. Cnaan A. Sakiyama S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4578-4584PubMed Google Scholar). In HeLa cells, we found a death stimulus (TNF/CHX) was required to effect nuclear translocation of pro-caspase-1, but in 293T cells, overexpressed pro-caspase-1 migrated to the nuclear compartment spontaneously. This may mean that overexpressed pro-caspase-1 titrates out an important factor(s) that in HeLa cells normally represses nuclear translocation until the cells receive a death stimulus. Our data clearly indicate that the prodomain is required for nuclear localization. First, the prodomain alone was translocated to the nuclear compartment. Second, p30-ICE (lacking the prodomain) was exclusively cytosolic. Third, mutations in a Lys/Arg-rich region of the prodomain blocked nuclear translocation of both the isolated prodomain and pro-caspase-1. The Lys/Arg-rich region represents a classical NLS because of its strong similarity to known signals for the nuclear transport of proteins (24Gorlich D. Mattaj I.M. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). For example, amino acids 4–12 of the prodomain (KVLKEKRKL) are almost identical to a known NLS in pro-interleukin-1α (KVLKKRRL) that is by itself sufficient to mediate nuclear translocation (21Maier J.A.M. Statuto M. Ragnotti G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1845-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Wessendorf J, M. Garfinkel S. Zhan X. Brown S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22100-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, only lysine at position 9 was found to be required for nuclear targeting of the prodomain. Our finding that nuclear targeting of pro-caspase-1 is mediated by a NLS whose function depends on a receptor-generated signal is reminiscent of several other proteins (e.g. NF-κB). NF-κB is normally retained in the cytosol through the binding of IκB, the inhibitor of NF-κB. Receptor-generated signals lead to the release of IκB and the subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-κB as a result of the unmasking of its NLS (25Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar). Why is pro-caspase-1 translocated to the nucleus? One likely possibility is that to obtain the maximum degree of cell death, caspase-1 must cleave nuclear death substrates (1Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4132) Google Scholar, 2Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 8: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2181) Google Scholar), but apart from cytosolic pro-interleukin-1β (pro-IL-1β) and pro-interleukin-18 (pro-IL-18), the physiological substrates of caspase-1 are unknown. The second (less likely and not mutually exclusive) possibility is that the prodomain augments apoptosis induced by the caspase-1 protease domain. This is supported by our detection of the endogenous prodomain in the nucleus but not in the cytosol of HeLa cells and by our finding that the prodomain alone induced apoptosis. It was demonstrated that apoptosis is potently induced by MACHβ1 and MRITβ1, truncated isoforms of two different long prodomain proteins that consist only of the prodomain (26Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2111) Google Scholar, 27Han D.K.M. Chaudhary P.M. Wright M.E. Friedman C. Trask B.J.

Their ability to induce cell death is probably the result of their DEDs recruiting other death-promoting proteins like fas-associated death domain and/or caspases to death receptors in the plasma membrane (27Han D.K.M. Chaudhary P.M. Wright M.E. Friedman C. Trask B.J. Riedel R.T. Baskin D.G. Schwartz S.M. Hood L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11333-11338Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The mode of killing by overexpression of the prodomain of caspase-1 must be different because (i) it lacks DEDs, (ii) we failed to detect cytosolic activation of caspase-1, and (iii) we showed that apoptosis is associated with nuclear translocation of pro-caspase-1 and release of its prodomain in the nucleus. Because the prodomain presumably lacks proteolytic activity, it is possible that the mechanism by which its overexpression activates an apoptosis pathway is via the inhibition of a crucial cell survival function. In some cells, the processing of cytosolic pro-IL-1β or pro-IL-18 follows the activation of caspase-1 (1Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4132) Google Scholar, 2Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 8: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2181) Google Scholar, 6Gu Y.

Science. 1997; 275: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar), but in HeLa cells, we showed that apoptosis is associated with nuclear targeting and processing of pro-caspase-1. We speculate that both the substrate specificity of caspase-1 and the particular cellular response to the processing of pro-caspase-1 (cytokine secretion or apoptosis) are mediated, at least in part, by its subcellular localization.

We have previously described a cell surface-associated H2O2-generating NADH:flavin:O2 oxidoreductase (referred to as NADH oxidase) activity in human lung fibroblasts induced by TGF-β1 (Thannickal, V. J., and Fanburg, B. L. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 30334–30338). In this study, the potential for regulation of this novel TGF-β1-activated oxidase in fibroblasts by protein tyrosine phosphorylation was examined. Immunoblots using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody demonstrated a time-dependent but delayed phosphorylation of two proteins of 115 and 103 kDa in cells stimulated with TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml). Similar to the effect on TGF-β1-induced H2O2 production, phosphorylation of these proteins was blocked by the addition of actinomycin D. The protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A inhibited TGF-β1-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation, NADH oxidase activation, and H2O2 production in a dose-dependent manner. Catalase, diphenyliodonium (an inhibitor of flavoenzymes), and suramin (an inhibitor of receptor activation, added 4 h after TGF-β1) had no effect on the induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of the 115- and 103-kDa proteins preceded the generation of H2O2 production and returned to control levels when H2O2 was undetectable at 48 h after TGF-β1 exposure. These results suggest that protein tyrosine phosphorylation by a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase(s) regulates the activity of the TGF-β1-responsive H2O2-generating NADH oxidase in human lung fibroblasts. Additionally, this study demonstrates that TGF-β1, which binds to a serine-threonine kinase receptor, is able to induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation in a delayed manner via a signaling pathway that requires transcriptional activation.

Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1)1 is a multifunctional cytokine belonging to a family of structurally and functionally related peptides involved in cellular growth, differentiation, and tissue repair processes (1Roberts A.B.

Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 signals through a heteromeric complex of type I and type II transmembrane serine/threonine receptor kinases (3Attisano L. Carcamo J. Ventura F. Weiss F.M.B. Massague J. Wrana J.L.

All serine/threonine receptor kinases described to date in mammalian cells are members of the TGF-β superfamily. Recent evidence suggests that post-receptor signaling involves a unique family of intracellular signaling proteins called Smads (a term derived from a merger of the Mothers against decapentaplegic (MAD)-related proteins identified in Drosophila and Sma-related proteins in Caenohabditis elegans) (5Sekelsky J.J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 790-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Smads occurs on serine residues within a conserved SSXS motif at the C terminus of the protein (7Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Rapid protein tyrosine phosphorylation in response to receptor activation by TGF-β1 has been previously found to be lacking (8Libby J. Martinez R. Weber M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 129: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), distinguishing it from typical fibroblast mitogens such as the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). Despite this, TGF-β1 has been shown to have mitogenic effects on cells of mesenchymal origin (9Leof E.B. Proper J.A. Goustin A.S. Shipley G.D. DiCorleto P.E. Moses H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1987; 49: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of the growth-promoting effects of TGF-β1 are poorly understood but are thought to occur through a basic FGF or PDGF autocrine loop (9Leof E.B. Proper J.A. Goustin A.S. Shipley G.D.

Cell. 1990; 63: 515-524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Recent reports suggest that TGF-β1 can activate members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family, which are dually phosphorylated on threonine and tyrosine through mechanisms that exclude autocrine loops involving other growth factors (14Reimann T. Hempel U. Krautwald S. Axmann A. Scheibe R. Seidel D. Wenzel K.-W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that TGF-β1 is able to activate a novel cell surface-associated NADH:flavin:O2 oxidoreductase (referred to as an NADH oxidase) in lung fibroblasts, resulting in the extracellular release of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (15Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30334-30338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). This was found to be a relatively delayed effect of TGF-β1 (>4 h after exposure), requiring new protein synthesis and resulting in sustained release of H2O2 for several h. Moreover, this enzymatic activity is different from the well characterized NADPH oxidase of phagocytic cells based on its specificity for NADH and enzyme kinetics. The H2O2-generating capacity of TGF-β1 is also distinct from that of other growth factors such as PDGF (16Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar), basic FGF (17Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), and epidermal growth factor (18Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar), which produce an early and relatively short-lived burst of intracellular H2O2. H2O2 generated by these growth factors appears to be linked to their mitogenic signals (16Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar, 17Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Although the precise function of TGF-β1-induced H2O2 production is unclear, it has been shown to induce the expression of the early growth response-1 (egr-1) gene in a mouse osteoblastic cell line (19Obha M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Thus, there is growing recognition that reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) such as H2O2 are essential signal transducers for specific actions of certain growth factors (15Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30334-30338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 16Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T.

Cellular redox status, determined by oxidant/antioxidant balance, appears to regulate protein tyrosine phosphorylation (20Staal F.J.T. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9943-9947Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 21Bauskin A.R. Alkalay I. Ben-Neriah Y.

Chem. 1993; 268: 17131-17137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that ROI generated by the NADPH oxidase in neutrophils induces tyrosine phosphorylation. There is also evidence that phosphorylation of this oxidase by both protein kinase C-dependent and -independent mechanisms is required for activation (23Rotrosen D. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19910-19915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation appears to be important in the activation of the phagocytic NADPH oxidase by formyl-Met-Leu-Phe and aggregated immunoglobulin (24Kusunoki T. Higashi H. Hosoi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to examine the potential for induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in response to TGF-β1 through oxidant generation and to determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation is required for the activation of the H2O2-generating NADH oxidase in human lung fibroblasts. All experiments were performed on early passage normal human fetal lung fibroblasts (IMR-90; Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ). The cells were maintained in medium consisting of RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma), and Fungizone (Life Technologies, Inc.); medium was changed every 3 days. Cells were plated on 35-or 100-mm dishes at a density of 106 cells/dish and incubated in 5% CO2, 95% air. Cells were growth-arrested by reducing the concentration of fetal calf serum in the medium to 0.01% for 48 h. Porcine platelet-derived TGF-β1 was obtained from R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN. Diphenyliodonium (DPI) was from ICN Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH. Herbimycin A was from Life Technologies, Inc.. All other reagents and inhibitors were from Sigma. H2O2 release from cultured fibroblasts into the overlying medium was assayed using a modification of the method of Ruch et al. (25Ruch W. Cooper P.H. Baggiolini J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 63: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This fluorometric method is based on the conversion of homovanillic acid, a substituted phenol, to its fluorescent dimer in the presence of H2O2 and horseradish peroxidase. At each time point after exposure to TGF-β1, all cells were first washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and then incubated with a reaction mixture containing 100 μm homovanillic acid, 5 units/ml horseradish peroxidase, type IV, and 1 mm HEPES in Hanks' balanced salt solution without phenol red, pH 7.4. This solution was then collected after a 1-h incubation, the pH was adjusted to 10.0 with 0.1 m glycine-NaOH buffer, and fluorescence was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 321 and 421, respectively. Linearity of the rate of H2O2release was established by measuring the amount of H2O2 released at regularly timed intervals over a 2-h period. All incubations of experimental samples were made with control samples containing the reaction mixture alone (i.e.without cells) to correct for any spontaneous dimerization of homovanillic acid. The exact concentrations of H2O2 of solutions used to plot standard curves were determined spectrophotometrically at 240 nm using an extinction coefficient of 43.6 m−1 × cm−1. Measurements of NADH oxidase activity were made as described previously (15Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30334-30338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Cells were first washed with RPMI media without phenol red, pH 7.4, and then incubated with NADH (250 μm) in the same medium for varying time intervals. The rate of NADH consumption was monitored by the decrease in absorbance at λ = 340 nm, using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. The absorption extinction coefficient used to calculate the amount of NADH consumed was 6.22 mm−1 × cm−1. For measurements of specific NADH:flavin oxidoreductase activity, the rate of NADH consumption inhibitable by DPI (26O'Donnell V.B. Tew D.G. Jones O.T.G. England P.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), a flavoprotein inhibitor, was used. This was done by adding DPI (10 μm) 30 min before the assays for NADH consumption. This DPI-inhibitable NADH consumption was used as a measure of NADH oxidase activity. All measurements were expressed in nmol of NADH/min/106 cells. Cell counts were performed concurrently with all of the biochemical measurements described. After removal of the extracellular medium for assay, culture dishes were washed with warm physiological saline, incubated with 1.0 ml of trypsin-EDTA for 2–3 min, and rapidly suspended in solution by pipetting. A 0.2-ml aliquot of cell suspension was then diluted for counting in a model ZM Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). Cultured cells from 100-mm Petri dishes were gently washed with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Cell lysates were then obtained by adding 1 ml of boiling lysis buffer (1% SDS, 1.0 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) to the dishes and boiling for 5 min. Samples were then sonicated for 5 s and centrifuged at 14 × g for 10 min. A 50-μl aliquot of the supernatant from each sample was separated for measurement of protein concentration, and the remainder was stored at −70 °C for subsequent use. Protein measurements were made using the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay Kit I, Bio-Rad. A fixed 30-μg protein sample from each group was mixed with a 1:5 v/v ratio of 6× electrophoresis sample buffer (0.2 m EDTA, 40 mmdithiothreitol, 6% SDS, 0.06 mg/ml pyronin, pH 6.8) and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min to denature protein. Sample mixtures were then loaded and subjected to electrophoresis in a 7% polyacrylamide gel by the method of Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the samples and molecular weight standards were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore Inc., Bedford, MA) and incubated in blocking buffer containing 75 mm sodium phosphate, 70 mm sodium chloride, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4, with 5% HiPure liquid gelatin (Norland, New Brunswick, NJ) for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was treated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-phosphotyrosine/horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) in blocking buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. Antibody to phospho-MAP kinase (extracellular-regulated kinase-1/extracellular-regulated kinase-2) used in some studies was from New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA. Three washes with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 were then performed before incubation with Supersignal Substrate Western blotting reagent (Pierce) for 10 min. The blot was exposed to chemiluminescent-sensitive Kodak X-Omat AR film, Eastman Kodak Co. Data from the various groups were expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical comparisons were made using the Student's t test for unpaired samples. For studies involving more than two groups, two-way analysis of variance was determined using the Scheffe's test (GB-STAT: Dynamic Microsystems, Silver Spring, MD). Statistical significance in all cases was defined as p < 0.05. Reproducibility of findings with Western immunoblots were confirmed by at least three experiments. Growth-arrested lung fibroblasts (IMR-90) were treated with TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) for varying periods of time up to 24 h, and the formation of phosphotyrosine protein intermediates was determined by immunoblotting techniques using a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). A time-dependent and sustained phosphorylation of two proteins of 115 and 103 kDa was observed in response to TGF-β1 (Fig. 1 A). This effect was relatively delayed, requiring 2 h for the phosphorylation of the 103-kDa protein and between 2–6 h for the 115-kDa protein. To determine whether this delay was due to the requirement for transcriptional activation and possible new protein synthesis, the effect of actinomycin D (0.05 μg/ml) on the induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation was examined. Fig. 1 B demonstrates that actinomycin D completely abrogates the phosphorylation of these proteins induced by TGF-β1. Low level tyrosine phosphorylation of the 115-kDa protein at base line (in untreated cells) was also blocked by actinomycin-D (Fig. 1 B). These findings were similar to our previous observations of a delayed and transcription-dependent effect of TGF-β1 on NADH oxidase activation/H2O2 production (15Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30334-30338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible association between protein tyrosine phosphorylation and oxidase activation. To determine whether the observed protein tyrosine phosphorylation in response to TGF-β1 is mediated by the generation of H2O2, we attempted to block this effect by co-incubating catalase (an enzyme that rapidly reduces H2O2 to H2O) and DPI (a flavoprotein inhibitor that blocks H2O2 production) with TGF-β1. Fig. 2 demonstrates that both catalase and DPI, at doses that inhibit H2O2 production (15Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30334-30338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), have no effect on the induced phosphorylation of the 115- and 103-kDa proteins. This suggests that TGF-β1-stimulated H2O2 production is not responsible for the induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. To then determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation is required for activation of the TGF-β1-responsive oxidase, the effect of PTK inhibitors on protein tyrosine phosphorylation, NADH oxidase activity, and H2O2 production was examined. The induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation by TGF-β1 was inhibited by the PTK inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A (Fig. 3), suggesting that this effect is mediated by the activation of PTK(s) by TGF-β1. These PTK inhibitors also inhibited TGF-β1-induced NADH oxidase activity and H2O2 production in a dose-dependent manner (Table I), supporting the requirement for protein tyrosine phosphorylation for the functional activation of this oxidase. The ability of genistein to be a more potent inhibitor of H2O2 release than herbimycin A, despite the fact that both agents inhibited NADH oxidase activity to control levels, may be explained by pharmacologic differences between these agents. Genistein is an isoflavonoid compound that, in addition to its effect of inhibiting PTK activity, has other effects including the ability to directly scavenge H2O2 (28Wei H. Bowen R. Cai Q. Barnes S. Wang Y. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1995; 208: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Initial experiments were performed with longer incubation of these inhibitors by adding them at the same time as TGF-β1, but later experiments showed that similar results were obtained when the incubation time was shortened to 2 h before assays (and 14 h after treatment with TGF-β1). This suggests that continuous activity of the PTK(s) involved is required for oxidase activity/H2O2 generation and that the observed inhibitory effect does not involve an early signaling event of TGF-β1 that will not be influenced by late addition of inhibitors.Table IEffect of PTK inhibitors on TGF-β1-induced NADH oxidase activity and H2O2 productionInhibitors (dose)NADH oxidase activityH2O2 productionnmol/min/106cellsControl0.11 ± 0.03NDTGF-β1 (1 ng/ml)0.25 ± 0.031-ap < 0.05 versus control.21.1 ± 0.91-ap < 0.05 versus control.TGF-β1 + herbimycin A (10−6m)0.19 ± 0.021-bp < 0.05 versus TGF-β1.16.5 ± 0.41-bp < 0.05 versus TGF-β1.TGF-β1 + herbimycin A (10−5m)0.09 ± 0.021-bp < 0.05 versus TGF-β1.10.7 ± 0.41-bp < 0.05 versus TGF-β1.TGF-β1 + genistein (10−5m)0.18 ± 0.021-bp < 0.05 versus TGF-β1.17.2 ± 0.71-bp < 0.05 versus TGF-β1.TGF-β1 + genistein (10−4m)0.02 ± 0.011-bp < 0.05 versus TGF-β1.4.2 ± 0.21-bp < 0.05 versus TGF-β1.Cells were exposed to TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) for 16 h before measurements of NADH oxidase activity and H2O2production as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Genistein and herbimycin A were added 2 h before measurements.

Since the effect on protein tyrosine phosphorylation by TGF-β1 is a delayed effect requiring transcriptional activation, we examined the possibility that autocrine production of mitogenic growth factors such as basic FGF and PDGF by TGF-β1 may mediate this effect. Such a mechanism for the indirect mitogenic action of TGF-β1 has been proposed (11Tucker R.F. Shipley G.D. Moses H.L. Holley R.W. Science. 1984; 226: 705-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 13Battegay E.J. Raines E.W. Seifert R.A. Bowen-Pope D.F. Ross R. Cell. 1990; 63: 515-524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). To block autocrine stimulation of receptors, suramin, an inhibitor of receptor activation (29Sachsenmaier C. Radler-Pohl A. Zinck R. Nordheim A. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 963-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), was used. We found complete inhibition of TGF-β1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation when cells were pretreated with 300 μm suramin (Fig. 4), suggesting that this effect is mediated via TGF-β receptor(s) signaling. However, when cells were treated with suramin 4 h after TGF-β1 (Fig. 4,post-treated), there was minimal change in the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation by TGF-β1, particularly that of the 115-kDa protein. The 4-h time point was selected so as to not interfere with TGF-β1 signaling while blocking any potential activation of PTK receptors by autocrine production of growth factors by TGF-β1. The slight decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation in cells post-treated with suramin likely represents residual inhibition on TGF-β receptor(s) activation since receptor signaling may not have been fully transduced by 4 h. Further support for this is derived from additional experiments in which these same samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis using an antibody to phospho-MAP kinase (extracellular-regulated kinase 1/extracellular-regulated kinase 2). In this case, suramin post-treatment completely blocked delayed induction of MAP kinase phosphorylation by TGF-β1 (results not shown), suggesting that phosphorylation of MAPK by TGF-β1 may be related to autocrine growth factor stimulation. This does not appear to be the mechanism by which TGF-β1 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the 115-kDa protein. Our results showing that TGF-β1-generated H2O2 was not responsible for the observed protein tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2) and that NADH oxidase activity/H2O2 production is inhibitable by PTK inhibitors (Table I) suggested that oxidase activation in response to TGF-β1 requires protein tyrosine phosphorylation but does not mediate it. We postulated that if the phosphorylation of these proteins is directly or indirectly involved with oxidase activation, tyrosine phosphorylation must occur before the observed generation of H2O2, and dephosphorylation must occur before (or at the same) time that H2O2 is no longer detectable. We have previously shown that NADH oxidase activity/H2O2 production stimulated by TGF-β1 occurs 4–8 h after treatment and returns to base line at 48 h (15Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30334-30338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows that phosphorylation of both the 115- and 103-kDa proteins occurs before the observed generation of H2O2. We have extended the time course to 48 h (0, 4 h followed by 8 h intervals) to determine the temporal relationship between protein tyrosine phosphorylation and H2O2 production. The phosphorylation of the 103-kDa protein occurs relatively early (Fig. 1 A, 2 h) and was found to be dephosphorylated well before the observed decrease in H2O2 generation, whereas phosphorylation of the 115-kDa protein more closely approximated the time course of H2O2 production with a sustained increase between 4 and 40 h and a return to control levels by 48 h (results not shown). There is now growing evidence that supports the concept that ROI such as superoxide anion (O⨪2) and H2O2function as signaling molecules for the action of certain growth factors in nonphagocytic cells (16Sundaresan M.

Bae et al. (18Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar) have shown that intrinsic receptor kinase activity was required for the generation of intracellular H2O2 in response to epidermal growth factor. The precise source and mechanism of O⨪2/H2O2 generation in nonphagocytic cells stimulated by these growth factors is unknown. Recent evidence suggests the requirement for Rac, a member of the Ras family of small GTP-binding proteins, in the generation of ligand-induced increases in intracellular ROI (30Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X Ferrans V.J. Sulcinar D.J. Gutkind J.S. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Finkel T. Biochem J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Rac is a functional component of the multimolecular phagocytic NADPH oxidase, which catalyzes the univalent reduction of O2 to O⨪2 (31Mizuno T. Kaibuchi K. Ando S. Musha T. Hiraoka K. Takaishi K. Asada M. Nunoi H. Matsuda I. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10215-10218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have described a novel NADH:flavin:O2 oxidoreductase (referred to as an NADH oxidase) activity in association with H2O2 production on the cell surface of human lung fibroblasts stimulated with TGF-β1 (15Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30334-30338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). This activity is distinct from that recently described for classical mitogenic growth factors (16Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar, 17Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol.

First, TGF-β1 induces H2O2 generation in a delayed (requiring transcriptional activation and new protein synthesis) but sustained manner in comparison with the early and relatively short burst of ROI production by these growth factors. Second, TGF-β1 appears to activate a cell surface oxidase that generates H2O2 extracellularly in contrast to intracellular production of ROI, presumably by an NADPH oxidase-like enzyme (30Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X Ferrans V.J. Sulcinar D.J. Gutkind J.S. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Finkel T. Biochem J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), in the case of growth factors associated with receptor PTKs (16Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T.

We have been unable to detect extracellular H2O2 in response to PDGF and basic FGF or an early ligand-induced generation of intracellular ROI in response to TGF-β1. 2V. J. Thannickal, K. D. L. Aldweib, and B. L. Fanburg, unpublished data. Third, extracellular release of H2O2 was associated with NADH-specific oxidase activity on the cell surface with no NADPH oxidase activity detected (15Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30334-30338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Finally, we are unable to demonstrate extracellular O⨪2 generation (using lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence and superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome2) in association with the TGF-β1-activated oxidase in fibroblasts, suggesting a 2-electron reduction of O2 to H2O2. Such a mechanism for the activation of molecular O2 by flavoprotein oxidases has been well demonstrated (reviewed in Ref. 32Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22459-22462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we show that the activity of the TGF-β1-responsive NADH oxidase is regulated by PTK(s). Our findings that the NADH oxidase activity/H2O2 production can be inhibited by adding PTK inhibitors for a short period (Table I, 2 h) after enzyme activity has been induced by TGF-β1 suggests that continuous activity of the kinase(s) is required for oxidase activity. Thus, it is unlikely that the involvement of PTK(s) in this activation pathway is an early post-receptor-mediated event. This is consistent with recent findings that the immediate post-receptor signaling mechanisms of TGF-β1, which binds a serine/threonine receptor kinase, involve proteins that are phosphorylated predominantly on serine (7Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Further support for this is obtained from our observations that protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by TGF-β1 is relatively delayed and is transcription-dependent (Fig. 1). Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-β1 binding to a serine-threonine receptor complex activates a signaling cascade that results in the transcription of factor(s) required for protein tyrosine phosphorylation leading to NADH oxidase activation/H2O2 production. Alternatively, the requirement for transcriptional activation in mediating these effects may be due to a direct inhibition of the expression of one or more functional components of the NADH oxidase complex. Our studies conclusively demonstrate the requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation in the activation of NADH oxidase activity/H2O2 production, and there appears to be a close relationship between the phosphorylation of the 115-kDa protein and H2O2 production, suggesting that direct phosphorylation of this protein may be required for activity. Furthermore, we have found that in a cell line (bovine pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells), which does not respond to TGF-β1 by generating H2O2, changes in protein tyrosine phosphorylation are not observed.2 We speculate that the 115-kDa protein in human lung fibroblasts might represent a component of the NADH oxidase complex that requires tyrosine phosphorylation for the enzyme to be catalytically active. Such a mechanism for the activation of an oxidase in not unprecedented, since tyrosine phosphorylation has been suggested to play a role in the activation of the NADPH oxidase in neutrophils by formyl-Met-Leu-Phe and IgG (24Kusunoki T. Higashi H. Hosoi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The 115- and 103-kDa proteins that are phosphorylated in response to TGF-β1 in fibroblasts are not known components of the phagocytic NADPH oxidase (31Mizuno T. Kaibuchi K. Ando S. Musha T. Hiraoka K. Takaishi K. Asada M. Nunoi H. Matsuda I. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10215-10218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is not surprising since growing evidence suggests that NAD(P)H oxidoreductases in nonphagocytic cells are likely to be both structurally and genetically distinct (33Meier B. Jesaitis A.J. Emmendorfer A. Roesler J. Quinn M.T. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Additionally, this study demonstrates the capacity of TGF-β1 to activate a nonreceptor PTK(s) that induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation in fibroblasts by a mechanism that requires transcriptional activation, an effect that, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported. This effect appears to be independent of autocrine growth factor stimulation by TGF-β1. Members of the MAP kinase family of proteins that are dually phosphorylated on threonine and tyrosine have been shown to be activated by TGF-β1 (14Reimann T. Hempel U. Krautwald S. Axmann A. Scheibe R. Seidel D. Wenzel K.-W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the proteins shown to be phosphorylated by TGF-β1 in this study do not correspond to the known MAP kinases or their substrates based on molecular weights alone (34Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precise function of the TGF-β1-activated NADH oxidase and extracellular production of H2O2 is currently unknown. The ability of TGF-β1 to generate extracellular ROI is unique and has not been found with any other growth factors tested to date. TGF-β1 plays a central role in tissue injury/repair that is a complex but well orchestrated process requiring regulated cell-cell communication. In this process, extracellular H2O2 may have paracrine effects on neighboring cells/matrix or autocrine effects. Obha et al. (19Obha M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) has reported that H2O2 generated extracellularly can diffuse back into the cell in an autocrine manner to activate early response genes (19Obha M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Defining functional role(s) for this novel TGF-β1-activated oxidase will be important in broadening our current understanding of the diverse actions of this cytokine."

Intravascular hemolysis is associated with endothelial cell (EC)1 injury in diseases such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and disseminated intravascular coagulation. We have hypothesized that the pathogenesis of these diseases is caused in part by heme released from oxidized free hemoglobin because of the ability of heme to enter the EC membrane, where it can catalyze oxidative injury and cell death (1Balla G. Vercellotti G.M. Muller-Eberhard U. Eaton J. Jacob H.S. Lab. Invest. 1991; 64: 648-655PubMed Google Scholar, 2Balla J. Jacob H.S. Balla G. Nath K. Eaton J.W. Vercellotti G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9285-9289Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Heme oxygenase (HO) and ferritin provide protection and constitute an adaptive response to excess heme (3Balla G. Jacob H.S.

HO is capable of releasing heme iron, while ferritin binds and stores iron in a form less apt to contribute to oxidative injury. We have previously shown that NO suppresses EC ferritin synthesis in response to hemin (4Juckett M.B. Weber M. Balla J. Jacob H.S. Vercellotti G.M. Free. Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); therefore, we were interested to study the effect of NO on adaptation to heme exposure and control of reactive iron. Control of heme-associated iron by HO and ferritin has been found to be an important level of defense in several models of injury. While acute heme exposure exacerbates oxidative injury, stimulation of HO and ferritin synthesis in the endothelium protects from subsequent exposure to hydrogen peroxide, activated neutrophils, or oxidized low density lipoprotein (3Balla G.

HO and ferritin are protective in models of injury that do not directly involve heme. Sublethal UV-A irradiation of cultured skin fibroblasts induces HO-1 and ferritin and provides protection against a subsequent lethal UV-A radiation exposure. Inhibition of HO-1 induction by antisense oligonucleotide reduces protection (7Vile G.F. Tyrrell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14678-14681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Vile G.F.

In the present work, we sought to determine the effect of NO on the control of heme-associated iron. Medium 199, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, and Hanks' balanced salt solution were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.; diethylenetriamine nitric oxide adduct (DETA/NO) and spermine nitric oxide adduct (SPER/NO) were from the Midwest Research Institute (Kansas City, MO); 1,1-diethyl-2-hydroxy-2-nitrosohydrazine (DEA/NO) was from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA); polyclonal anti-human HO-1 antibody was obtained from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. (Golden, CO); and tin-protoporphyrin IX (SnPP) was from Porphyrin Products, Inc. (Logan, UT). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified. The NO donors have the following half-lives at pH 7.4 and 37 °C: DETA/NO, 20 h; SPER/NO, 39 min; and DEA/NO, 2 min (23Mooradian D.L. Hutsell T.C. Keefer L.K. J. Cardiovasc.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs) were isolated and cultured as described previously (4Juckett M.B. Weber M. Balla J. Jacob H.S.

CCL-119) and human kidney epithelial cell line (293T cells) (ATCC no. 45504) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HUVECs were exposed to 10 μm hemin for 1 h in serum-free M199 medium followed by the addition of fresh HUVEC medium with or without 500 μm DETA/NO. At various times up to 3 days after hemin treatment, cells were collected, and ferritin content was measured as described by Juckett et al. (4Juckett M.B. Weber M. Balla J. Jacob H.S. Vercellotti G.M. Free. Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Iron release was performed as described by Hibbs et al. (25Hibbs J.B.J. Taintor R.R. Vavrin Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). 293T cells were labeled with55Fe for 24 h followed by the addition of NO donor in fresh medium. Cells were incubated with spermine/NO (100 μm) for 1–2 h or DETA/NO (100 μm) for 24 h. Specific release of iron was calculated as described by Hibbs et al. (25Hibbs J.B.J. Taintor R.R. Vavrin Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Heme content of the formic acid-solubilized PAECs was determined spectrophotometrically at 398 nm using hemin standards prepared in concentrated formic acid and an extinction coefficient of 1.5 × 105m−1 cm−1 (26Kuross S.A. Rank B.H. Hebbel R.P. Blood. 1988; 71: 876-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HO activity in EC microsomes was measured by bilirubin generation as described previously (4Juckett M.B. Weber M. Balla J. Jacob H.S. Vercellotti G.M. Free. Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with modification. The cells were disrupted by three cycles of freezing and thawing and sonication on ice prior to centrifugation at 18,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was added to reaction mixtures (final volume, 500 μl) containing 3 mg of rat liver cytosol, 20 μm hemin, 2 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 0.2 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.8 mm NADPH, and 0–100 μm SPER/NO for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. Liver cytosol was prepared by homogenizing a rat liver in 1 volume of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1.15% KCl). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min 4 °C, and the supernatant further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and protein was measured. SPER/NO (1 mm stock) was dissolved in 10 mm NaOH and kept on ice in the dark until used. The formed bilirubin was extracted with chloroform, and the absorption was measured as the difference between 464 and 530 nm (extinction coefficient, 40 mm−1 cm−1 for bilirubin). HO activity is expressed as pmol of bilirubin formed per mg of endothelial cell protein per 60 min. In some experiments, following incubation as described above, the assay mixture was frozen in liquid nitrogen for assessment by EPR. The effect of SPER/NO on biliverdin conversion to bilirubin was measured by performing the HO assay as described above but omitting the microsomal supernatant and substituting 20 μm biliverdin for hemin. CCRF-CEM cells were used instead of ECs due to the ease of growing the large numbers of cells required for EPR. The cells were grown to a density of approximately 2 × 106 cells/ml prior to treatment, and a total of 40 × 106 cells were collected for each experimental group. The following were added for 24 h in medium: 10 μm hemin, 10 μm SnPP, and/or 100 μm DETA/NO. In some groups, after incubation with hemin with or without SnPP for 24 h, 1 mm DEA/NO was added in medium for 5 min. Following incubation, the cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, placed into a quartz EPR cuvette, and frozen at 77 K in liquid nitrogen. The total volume was 2 ml to assure that the entire sample was within the effective microwave irradiation area. EPR spectra were obtained using a standard Century series Varian E-100 spectrometer. EPR parameters for each experiment are noted in the figure legends. The g factor values were determined relative to an external standard containing potassium nitrosodisulfonate (g = 2.0057). Gutteridge et al.(27Gutteridge J.M. Rowley D.A. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 28Gutteridge J.M. Rowley D.A. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) have described an assay, based on the use of the antibiotic bleomycin, to detect iron complexes capable of catalyzing free radical reactions in biological samples. The assay is based on the ability of bleomycin, which is a weak iron chelator, to degrade exogenous DNA in the presence of iron. The degree of DNA degradation will be in proportion to the loosely bound iron that is available to bind bleomycin in the biological sample. The assay does not measure heme or ferritin-associated iron. Although the exact nature of the iron measured by the bleomycin assay is unclear, it is a useful measure of iron available to participate in free radical reactions (29Paller M.S. Jacob H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7002-7006Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 30Gutteridge J.M. Mumby S. Koizumi M. Taniguchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

All buffers and reagents except bleomycin were treated with Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad) to remove extraneous iron. ECs grown in 10-cm dishes were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and lysed in 20 mm Hepes with 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The lysate was incubated with 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Hepes, 500 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 50 μg/ml bleomycin, and 70 mg/ml ascorbate, pH 7.2, for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 mm EDTA. 0.3% thiobarbaturic acid and 1.5m HCl were added, and the mixture was incubated at 100 °C for 10 min. Each sample was run in parallel with a blank including all constituents except bleomycin as a control for other thiobarbaturic reactive substances. The samples were read spectrophotometrically at 540 nm. Iron concentrations were calculated according to a standard curve. The values were corrected for protein content in each group. Confluent HUVECs grown in 10-cm dishes were exposed to 10 μm hemin and/or 200 μm SPER/NO in medium 199 without serum for 1 h at 37 °C. The medium was removed and replaced with complete medium, including SPER/NO for the NO-treated groups, for an additional 3 h. The cells were lysed, and an immunoblot was performed according to standard methods using a polyclonal anti-human HO-1 antibody that does not cross-react with HO-2. The bands from the immunoblot were quantitated using computer-assisted densitometry. PAECs were washed two times and incubated with serum-free medium alone or including 10 μmhemin. NO-treated groups also received 200 μm SPER/NO during hemin treatment. After hemin treatment, the cells were washed twice and treated with hydrogen peroxide in HBSS with 20 mmHepes for 2 h. The hydrogen peroxide was removed, and fresh medium was added, followed by a further 24-h incubation. Neutral red was then added to the medium for 2 h. After incubation, the cells were washed, and the retained dye was solubilized in 1:1 (v/v) ethanol, 1% acetic acid and quantitated by its absorbance at 540 nm. The effect of NO donors on catalytic iron was determined by Student's t test. Linear regression analysis was used to study the relationship between HO activity and NO donor. The effect of NO donor on PAEC survival after hydrogen peroxide treatment was determined by two-factor ANOVA using hydrogen peroxide dose and treatment as independent factors. Statistics were performed using SPSS 7.0 for WindowsTM software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). ECs exposed to hemin will adapt by synthesizing HO and ferritin, which will enable the cell to degrade heme and sequester the released iron in a less reactive form. As we have shown previously (4Juckett M.B. Weber M. Balla J. Jacob H.S. Vercellotti G.M. Free. Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), ECs exposed to hemin for 1 h have elevated ferritin content 24 h later, but the NO donor DETA/NO 500 μm (half-life of 20 h, pH 7.4, 37 °C) prevents the hemin-induced ferritin increase (Table I). The effect of DETA/NO on ferritin content was statistically significant (p = 0.003 by weighted ANOVA). Thus, despite a similar exposure to hemin for 1 h, the ferritin content in the group treated with DETA/NO is 16% of that seen at 24 h in the group not exposed to a NO donor. If intracellular ferritin is important in the control of excess catalytically active iron, then cells treated with DETA/NO may be less able to sequester iron resulting from an second exposure to hemin. We wondered if the inhibitory effect of NO on ferritin synthesis would impair adaptation to excess heme with respect to the control of non-heme, catalytically active iron.Table IFerritin content in EC after 1 h of hemin exposureTimeMediumDETA/NO1-aThe difference between the medium and DETA/NO groups was significant, p = 0.003 by a weighted ANOVA.AverageRangeAverageRangehng/mg proteinng/mg protein016.715.9–17.619.217.2–21.1241345.81319.8–1371.8201.3186.4–216.248304.4228.2–379.946.842.6–51.072136.2120.5–152.09.28.1–10.4ECs were exposed to hemin for 1 h followed by the removal and addition of medium alone or medium with 500 μm DETA/NO.

Commun. 1996; 229: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) on human body fluids have shown that iron available to stimulate free radical reactions is composed of loosely bound, low molecular weight chelates. This pool of iron can be measured by the bleomycin assay with a high degree of sensitivity (0.1–0.5 μm) and is distinct from iron present in hemin-, ferritin-, and iron-containing enzymes. To address whether NO inhibition of ferritin synthesis impairs the ability of cells to control catalytically active iron, we incubated endothelial cells with hemin and measured non-heme catalytic iron using the bleomycin assay. As shown in Fig. 2, catalytic iron rose 3.5-fold in naive ECs 1 h after exposure to 10 μm hemin (compare 0- and 2-h time points) as measured by the bleomycin assay, which does not measure heme iron or that bound by ferritin. When these cells were allowed to incubate for 20 h in medium alone, catalytic iron returned to base-line levels (Fig. 1,open circles, 22-h time point). Upon a second exposure to hemin, catalytic iron rose only 24%, indicating more efficient handling of iron released from hemin compared with the initial exposure. If the ECs were treated with 500 μmDETA/NO during the 20-h incubation after the initial hemin exposure (Fig. 1, closed circles), there was a drop in catalytic iron similar to cells in medium alone. However, in contrast to the untreated ECs, there was a 3.0-fold increase in catalytic iron after a second exposure to hemin, which is not different from naive ECs (p = 0.53, Student's t test). The increase associated with a second hemin exposure is significantly higher than the increase in ECs not exposed to DETA/NO (p < 0.0001, Student's t test). The lack of adaptation to hemin after treatment with DETA/NO demonstrates that, as expected, inhibiting ferritin synthesis induced by hemin prevents the rapid removal and sequestration of iron released from subsequent hemin exposure.Figure 1Catalytically available iron in PAECs after exposure to hemin and DETA/NO sequentially. Confluent PAECs were exposed to 10 μm hemin in serum-free medium for 1 h followed by removal and addition of fresh medium or medium containing 500 μm DETA/NO for an additional 20 h. Adaptation to heme was assessed by removal of medium containing DETA/NO and washing in buffered saline prior to reexposure to 10 μm heme in serum-free medium for 1 h. After heme exposure, medium was added for an additional 1 h prior to measurement of catalytic iron. Measurements were taken in untreated cells, 1 h after an initial hemin exposure, 20 h after an initial hemin exposure, and 1 h after a second hemin exposure. Following treatment, catalytic iron was measured using the bleomycin assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” *, p < 0.001 compared with iron content after initial exposure. #, p = 0.001 compared with cells not treated with DETA/NO. All values represent the mean of four experiments ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We wondered whether cells might be protected from hemin in the presence of NO by direct inhibition of heme degradation. In the preceding experiment, ECs were exposed to hemin and NO donor sequentially to avoid a direct interaction between hemin and NO that might alter iron release from heme. To assess direct effects of NO on hemin degradation and release of iron, we incubated cells with a NO donor and hemin simultaneously and assessed the changes in catalytic iron. As shown in Fig. 2 (second column), ECs exposed to hemin alone for 1 h experience approximately a 3-fold rise in catalytic iron (similar to findings in Fig. 1). The addition of the NO donor SPER/NO (half-life 39 min, pH 7.4, 37 °C) during hemin exposure (Fig. 2, third column) significantly reduces the rise in catalytic iron compared with ECs exposed to hemin alone (32 ± 3versus 61 ± 13 nmol iron/mg protein, respectively,p = 0.02). Thus NO donors prevent both the rise in catalytic iron and the induction of ferritin synthesis resulting from excess hemin. Hibbs et al. (25Hibbs J.B.J. Taintor R.R. Vavrin Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) have shown that NO can induce the loss of cellular iron, raising the question as to whether the spermine/NO used in our experiments could be inducing the rapid release of cellular iron. We incubated cells that had been prelabeled with 55Fe with 100 μm spermine/NO and measured the release of iron into the media. The spermine/NO treatment was associated with the loss of 0.9 ± 1.2 and 2.9 ± 2.1% of cellular iron after 1 and 2 h of incubation, respectively. Cells that were incubated with 100 μm DETA/NO (half-life 20 h) for 24 h experienced 22.9 ± 8.3% iron release. These data are consistent with those of Hibbs et al. (25Hibbs J.B.J. Taintor R.R. Vavrin Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), who found little NO-mediated iron release until after 4 h of exposure to NO. These results suggest that NO may inhibit heme degradation and prevent the rise in iron that is available to catalyze oxidative injury and drive ferritin synthesis. We considered that NO might prevent the increase in catalytic iron resulting from hemin exposure by preventing cellular uptake of exogenous hemin or causing the displacement of hemin from the cell. For example, it has previously been shown that treatment of hepatocytes with the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine results in loss of microsomal heme when measured 12 h after treatment (12Kim Y.M. Bergonia H.A. Muller C. Pitt B.R. Watkins W.D. Lancaster Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5710-5713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We studied the effect of NO on EC hemin uptake and retention by incubating confluent monolayers of cells with 25 μm hemin in serum-containing medium for 24 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of DETA/NO. Following incubation, total cellular heme was measured. We chose to expose cells to hemin over 24 h in serum-containing medium because hemin uptake is gradual in the presence of serum, and an effect of constant NO exposure (in the form of DETA/NO) on heme content over this time period should be detectable. As shown in Fig. 3, exposure of ECs to hemin results in approximately a 4-fold increase in total cellular heme over 24 h (second column). The addition of DETA/NO results in a dose-dependent increase in cellular heme (p< 0.001 by ANOVA), indicating that exposure to the NO donor resulted in accumulation rather than displacement of cellular heme. We have found that NO donors decrease ferritin synthesis and inhibit release of catalytic iron from hemin. Also, treatment with NO donors led to the accumulation of heme in cells exposed to exogenous hemin. Taken together, these results suggest that NO might inhibit the degradation of cellular heme and release of iron. HO-1 and -2 are the enzymes thought to be primarily responsible for degrading intracellular heme, although heme can be degraded nonenzymatically by its reaction with peroxides and other oxidants (33Balla G. Jacob H.S. Eaton J.W. Belcher J.D. Vercellotti G.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1700-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In experiments with a fibroblast cell line, we found that the addition of the inhibitor of HO, SnPP during hemin exposure inhibited the rise in bleomycin-detectable iron to 61.3 ± 2.5% (p < 0.001 ANOVA) of that seen in cells without the inhibitor. This indicates that HO releases a significant proportion of the bleomycin detectable iron from heme degradation; therefore, we narrowed our focus to study the effect of NO on heme metabolism by HO. We first studied whether NO could inhibit heme degradation by preventing HO-1 induction by hemin. To address this question, we measured HO-1 protein by immunoblot in ECs treated with hemin and NO donors (Fig. 4). Exposure to hemin for 1 h followed by a 3-h incubation in medium results in approximately a 2-fold increase in HO-1 protein (Fig. 4,second column). A similar hemin exposure in the presence of SPER/NO (250 μm) inhibits the rise in HO-1 to the level seen in untreated ECs (third column). Treatment of ECs with SPER/NO alone results in a slight increase in HO protein consistent with other reports demonstrating the induction of HO synthesis by NO (fourth column). This data indicates that NO donors inhibit the induction of HO-1 by hemin suggesting that NO may directly interact with hem"
https://openalex.org/W2034554330,"Abstract The data used to support the idea that malonyl-coenzyme A (CoA)-sensitive carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT-I) is localized on the outer mitochondrial membrane are based on harsh techniques that disrupt mitochondrial physiology. We have turned to the use of the French press, which produces a shearing force that denudes mitochondria of their outer membrane without the physiologically disruptive effects characteristic of phosphate swelling. Our results indicate that the mitoplasts contain just 15–19% of the outer membrane marker enzyme activity while retaining 85% of the total CPT activity and 50% of both CPT-I, as well as long-chain acyl-CoA synthase activity, the latter two supposed outer membrane enzymes. These mitoplasts were shown by electron microscopy to have the configuration of mitochondria that merely have been divested of their outer membranes. Carnitine-dependent fatty acid oxidation was retained in the mitoplasts, showing that they were physiologically intact. Moreover, protein immunoblotting analysis showed that CPT-I, as well as the inner CPT-II, was localized in the mitoplast fraction. The outer membrane fraction, which consisted of membrane “ghosts,” contained most (50–60%) of marker enzyme activity, monoamine oxidase-B and porin proteins, but only about 27–29% CPT-I activity. Because CPT-I and long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase appear to be associated with both inner and outer membranes, we postulate that these enzymes reside in contact sites, which represent a melding of both limiting membranes."

Intrigued by Lankester's early observation, we have reexamined smooth muscle tissue from the human rectum and from other human tissues. We reasoned that if Mb did occur generally in smooth muscle, even at a low concentration, it might function not only in facilitated diffusion (8Wittenberg J.B. J. Gen.

In particular, it might affect the kinetics of the dynamic cycle in which S-nitrosohemoglobin delivers NO to vascular tissues and causes vasodilation (11Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar). Samples of human smooth muscle from rectum, uterus, small intestine, colon, and bladder were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Each of these samples was obtained during surgery with the permission of the patient. All of the surgical procedures involved removal of cancerous tissue, but the muscle cell samples studied here were not themselves cancerous. About 0.4 g of smooth muscle from each of these tissues was used for the mRNA preparation with the Fast Track mRNA Isolation Kit version 3.5 from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). mRNA (10 μg) from each tissue was combined with an oligo dT 28-mer that has an XbaI site at its 5′ end (500 ng) in diethylpyrocarbonate sterile deionized water (DEPC-dH2O) prepared by adding 100 μl of DEPC (Sigma, catalog number D-5758) to 100 ml of deionized water, shaken, and incubated at 37 °C overnight and autoclaved. The annealing reaction was carried out by incubating the mixture at 65 °C for 5 min followed by cooling on ice.

Biochemical Corp., 5 μl of 0.1m dithiothreitol (Life Technologies, Inc.), 14 μl of DEPC-dH2O, and 2 μl of 200 units/μl Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) were added to the annealing reaction solution. After incubating at 37 °C for an hour, 5 μl of a 3 m sodium acetate solution and 125 μl of 100% ethanol were added, and the resulting solution was kept at −20 °C overnight. After ethanol precipitation, the pellet was dissolved in 20 μl of DEPC-dH2O. A polymerization chain reaction (PCR) was carried out to amplify Mb cDNA. The coding sequence of Mb was obtained by using 2 μl of the mRNA·cDNA from the reverse transcription as template and two synthesized primers, 5′-GACTCTAGAATGGGGCTCAGCGACGGG-3′ and 5′-AGTTCTAGACTAGCCCTGGAAGCCCAG-3′, which are complementary to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the known human Mb coding sequence (12Weller P. Jeffreys A.J. Wilson V. Blanchetot A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and contain an XbaI site. The 100-μl PCR reaction solution contained 1 × PCR buffer (10 × PCR buffer: 0.5m KCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 15 mm MgCl2), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 200 μm dNTP, 100 pmol each of NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal primers, and 2.5 units of Promega Taq polymerase. Denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min was followed by 30 cycles of 1 min each at 94 °C for denaturing, 48 °C for annealing, and 72 °C for elongation followed by a final 15 min at 72 °C for complete elongation. The resulting PCR product was analyzed after running an aliquot on a 1.0% agarose gel. The PCR product (480 base pairs) obtained by amplification of Mb cDNA (see above) was digested withXbaI and inserted into pUC19 vector (New England Biolabs) cut with XbaI. The ligation of the target DNA with the vector was achieved with a DNA ligation kit from Takara Shuzo Co. (catalog number 6021). The resulting ligation solution was used to transform MAX efficiency DH5α competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmid DNA was extracted from positive clones, and the cDNA insert was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (U.S. Biochemical Corp. SequenaseTM version 2.0 DNA Sequencing kit). A blot of mRNA from multiple human tissues (catalog number 7760-1), supplied by CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., was used to test for Mb expression in other tissues. The blot included mRNA from human heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. The human Mb cDNA from the PCR amplification was used as a probe, and the manufacturer's protocol was followed. The procedure of Schuder et al. (13Schuder S. Wittenberg J.B. Haseltine B. Wittenberg B.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 92: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was used in an attempt to quantify Mb in muscle tissue after removal of Hb by affinity chromatography. The affinity column was made by coupling the αβ dimer of human Hb to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. The Hb in the extract binds to the αβ dimer on the column, and Mb passes through unretarded (13Schuder S. Wittenberg J.B. Haseltine B. Wittenberg B.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 92: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A column (0.9 × 7 cm) of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (2 g, Pharmacia Fine Chemicals) was used as described (13Schuder S. Wittenberg J.B. Haseltine B. Wittenberg B.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 92: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Human Hb (8 μmol) 2All molar concentrations of Hb are on a heme basis. was used for the coupling reaction. The capacity of the column was determined by applying pure human Hb and then measuring the absorbance of the eluate at 420 nm. The column retained all of 0.3 μmol of Hb applied but 0.7 μmol of Hb exceeded the capacity and was detected in the eluate. Therefore, quantities of extract were applied that contained less than 0.3 μmol of Hb. The column was regenerated with 2.0 mNaCl, which removes bound Hb. The extraction of rectal skeletal muscle, rectal smooth muscle, and uterine tissue generally followed Schuderet al. (13Schuder S. Wittenberg J.B. Haseltine B. Wittenberg B.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 92: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Frozen tissue (0.4–1.0 g) was cut into small pieces and ground under liquid nitrogen. The resulting tissue powder was weighed and extracted with 10 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 5 mm Na2EGTA, incubated on ice for 5 min, and then centrifuged at 10,000–20,000 × g for 10 min. The clear supernatant Extract I was used for affinity chromatography. The remaining pellet was extracted with 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. This extract was centrifuged as above to give a second supernatant, Extract II. Extract I (4 ml) of rectal smooth muscle was applied to the column at 4 °C and developed with 10 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The flow was downward under gravity, and the flow rate was adjusted to be under 15 ml/h. The fractions containing apparent Mb were collected and pooled. Extract I of rectal skeletal muscle was similarly processed. The spectra of both deoxy-Mb and CO-Mb were measured as described (13Schuder S. Wittenberg J.B. Haseltine B. Wittenberg B.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 92: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The millimolar extinction coefficients were taken to be εmM = 207 mm−1 cm−1 at 424 nm (MbCO) and εmM = 121 mm−1 cm−1at 435 nm (deoxyMb), the values given for horse Mb (14Antonini E. Physiol. Rev. 1965; 45: 123-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We measured the absorbance ratio,A 424/A 435 = 0.820 for horse deoxy-Mb and then calculated the εmM value at 424 nm: 0.820 × 121 = 99.2 mm−1cm−1. The apparent concentration of Mb was calculated from the following equation.CMb=ACOMb−AdeoxyMbɛmMCOMb−ɛmMdeoxyMb(Eq. 1) where the εmM values are for 424nm. All HPLC was performed on a SynChropak RP-P C18 reverse phase column (250 × 4.6 mm, SynChrom, Inc., Lafayette, IN) driven by a Beckman model 332 gradient chromatography system. Extract I of rectal tissue and the eluate from the affinity column (see above) were applied separately to the HPLC column with the following gradient program: Buffer A 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, Buffer B, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile, 0–5 min, 0% B; 5–15 min, 0–30% B; 15–115 min, 30–55% B; 115–125 min, 55–0% B. Absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 220 nm with an Hitachi model 100–10 spectrophotometer. Absorbing fractions were collected and lyophilized. The protein was redissolved in water and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (10% resolving gel and 3% stacking gel) (15Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1991: 96-116Google Scholar). The separation of Mb from serum albumin in Extract I (after affinity chromatography) was examined with a Bio-Gel SEC 40XL size exclusion column (300 × 7.8 mm; Bio-Rad catalog number 125-0604). The buffer used was 100 mm KPO4, 1 mm Na2EDTA at pH 7.0 running at 25 °C. The column eluate was monitored at either 280 or 415 nm with an Hitachi spectrophotometer (model 100–10) with an HPLC system previously described (16Zhu H. Ownby D.W. Riggs C.K. Nolasco N.J. Stoops J.K. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30007-30021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A reference mixture of bovine serum albumin (Sigma catalog number A-8531) and horse Mb (Sigma catalog number M-0630) was also examined in this way. Proteins in both Extract I and Extract II of rectal smooth muscle tissue were run on SDS-PAGE. The gel was electro-blotted to ProtranTM Nitrocellulose membrane (BA79, 0.1-μm pore size, Schleicher & Schuell). The transferring buffer contained 10 mm CAPS at pH 11 and 10% methanol. The chemiluminescent ECLTM Western blotting System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the manufacturer's protocol was used for the detection of immobilized specific antigens conjugated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies. The primary antibody was rabbit anti-human Mb (Sigma catalog number M-8648, diluted 1:500). The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit whole antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech catalog number NA934, diluted 1:1500). Biopsy samples of human tissues were trimmed of connective tissue and pinned to balsa wood sticks between two muscles from the hind limb of an adult rat (soleus and extensor digitorum longus). These tissues were then frozen in isopentane cooled to −60 °C with liquid nitrogen. Cryostat sections (10 μm) were collected on gelatin-subbed slides and stored dessicated at −20 °C. For immunolabeling, slides were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 0.2% BSA, incubated in primary antibody diluted in PBS + BSA overnight at 4 °C, washed three times, 5 min each with PBS + BSA, incubated in secondary antibody diluted in PBS + BSA for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times, 5 min each with PBS, and coverslipped using FITC Guard (Testog, Chicago, IL). Primary antibodies were rabbit anti-human Mb (Sigma catalog number M-8648, diluted 1:500); monoclonal mouse anti-smooth muscle myosin (Sigma catalog number M-7786, diluted 1:250); monoclonal anti-human sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (clone A4.1025, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Johns Hopkins University, used as undiluted supernatant). Secondary antibodies were FITC-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig-G, F(ab′)2 fragment (Sigma catalog number F-2266, diluted 1:200) and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, F(ab′)2 fragment (Cappel, Durham, NC, catalog number 55671, diluted 1:200). In some cases double immunolabeling was performed by applying a mixture of mouse anti-smooth muscle myosin and rabbit anti-Mb antibodies followed by a mixture of FITC-conjugated anti-mouse and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Slides were examined with a Nikon Optiphot epifluorescence microscope equipped with rhodamine and fluorescein filters. Images were acquired with an integrating CCD camera connected to a Macintosh computer containing a frame grabber and NIH image software. Images were cropped and labeled by use of Adobe Photoshop and Canvas software and printed with a Sony color printer. cDNA encoding human Mb was amplified by PCR from the total cDNA prepared from different tissues. Specificity was achieved by using primers constructed on the basis of the gene-derived NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences (12Weller P. Jeffreys A.J. Wilson V. Blanchetot A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The same mass of tissue (∼0.4 g) was used from each source for Southern hybridization (Fig. 1) so that the signal should reflect approximately the relative quantity of Mb mRNA in each tissue. The strongest signal was clearly from rectal smooth muscle tissue with much less from tissue of the small intestine and uterus. Only a very weak signal was obtained from colon tissue, and none was detected from bladder tissue. Northern hybridization of mRNA from diverse tissues probed with cDNA for human Mb gave signals only for skeletal muscle and heart mRNA (Fig. 2). Although no signal was detected in the other tissues, the Northern hybridization is much less sensitive than the Southern hybridization prepared with PCR-amplified cDNA, so the negative finding could mean only that an insufficient quantity of mRNA was present in the experiment. We examined tissues with smooth muscle from rectum, uterus, colon, small intestine, bladder, arteries, and veins with immunohistochemical techniques. Differently labeled fluorescent antibodies to both human smooth muscle myosin and Mb were used. The results reveal that human rectal muscle is immunopositive for both smooth muscle myosin and for Mb (Fig. 3 a). A cryostat section passing longitudinally (panels A and B) and two sections passing orthogonally (panels C and D and panels E and F) through a bundle of smooth muscle fibers were double-immunolabeled; immunoreactivity to smooth muscle myosin was detected by using an FITC-labeled second antibody and to Mb by using a rhodamine-conjugated second antibody. Views through the fluorescein filter set are shown in panels A, C, and E, and views through the rhodamine filter set are shown in panels B, D, and F (Fig. 3 a). The tissue sections in panels A, B, C, and D (Fig. 3 a) received a mixture of anti-smooth muscle myosin and anti-Mb antibodies, followed by a mixture of the two secondary antibodies. The sections in panels E and F received no primary antibody but were incubated with the mixture of the two secondary antibodies. Thus, the sections in panels E and F serve as negative controls. Although some labeling of connective tissue is obvious in the absence of primary antibody, the muscle fibers themselves are unlabeled. Additional controls (also not shown) showed that these smooth muscle fibers were unreactive with an antibody to sarcomeric myosin and that rat skeletal muscles were unreactive with the anti-smooth muscle myosin. Very similar results were obtained for artery and vein tissue (Fig. 3 b), for uterine tissue (Fig. 3 c), and for colon, small intestine, and bladder (data not shown). The PCR-amplified cDNA for Mb from human rectal smooth muscle was cloned into pUC19 and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence was found to be identical to that of Mb from striated muscle (12Weller P. Jeffreys A.J. Wilson V. Blanchetot A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The same tissue preparation also yielded PCR-amplified cDNA encoding part of the heavy chain of smooth muscle myosin, thus confirming the identification of the tissue. The principle of the procedure (see “Materials and Methods”) is to use an affinity column that selectively removes Hb but not Mb. Extract I (4 ml) of rectal smooth muscle containing less than 0.05 μmol of Hb was applied to the column. The amount of Hb in the aliquot of Extract I was much less than the capacity of the affinity column, which can bind at least 0.3 μmol of Hb. Fig. 4 shows the HPLC pattern obtained for Extract I before (Fig. 4 a) and after (Fig. 4 b) passage through the column. The α and β chains of Hb (about half of the total protein) have clearly been removed by the column. Quantitative correspondence of the HPLC absorbance with the spectrophotometric determination can be determined as follows with the use of hemin and protein extinction coefficients previously determined (17Ownby D.W. Zhu H. Schneider K. Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13539-13547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The quantity of human Hb in the original solution, determined from the α and β chain absorbances in Fig. 4 a, was found to be 41.8 nmol. The total heme (measured as hemin) in Fig. 4 a corresponds to 73.4 nmol in the original solution. The difference (73.4 − 41.8) should give the heme attributed to Mb, 31.6 nmol, which corresponds to 174 μmol of Mb/kg tissue. Although this value is within 8% of the quantity of Mb, 188 μmol, determined by difference spectrophotometry of Extract I after affinity chromatography, SDS electrophoresis of fraction 4 in Fig. 4 bshowed that it is largely composed of a 66-kDa polypeptide, and only traces of 17-kDa protein are present (data not shown). Fraction 4 was electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for sequencing by the Microanalysis Facility of the University of Texas with a model 477A Applied Biosystems Sequencer. The 20-residue sequence obtained showed that the 66-kDa protein is serum albumin. Therefore, most of the apparent Mb in the spectrophotometric assay must be attributed to heme-binding serum albumin and not Mb. Heme-binding by serum albumin was tested with the Schuder et al. (13Schuder S. Wittenberg J.B. Haseltine B. Wittenberg B.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 92: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) spectrophotometric assay for Mb content as follows. Hemin (Fluka, 1 μl of 12.4 mm stock in 0.1 N NaOH) was added to 4 ml of 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 8 nmol of BSA (Sigma) to give a 1.5 molar ratio of hemin to albumin. An apparent Mb content, 0.66 μm, was determined spectrophotometrically as described by Schuder et al. (13Schuder S. Wittenberg J.B. Haseltine B. Wittenberg B.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 92: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (see “Materials and Methods”). In contrast to the smooth muscle analysis, Extract I of rectal skeletal muscle did not show a large quantity of serum albumin. Analysis of fraction 7 in Fig. 4 c showed that it consists of Mb and that serum albumin was absent (data not shown). Analysis of Extracts I and II of rectal smooth muscle tissue after SDS-PAGE showed that the two extracts have different protein band patterns (Fig. 5 a). Additional cellular proteins were obtained in Extract II. When Extract I and Extract II were probed with anti-Mb antibody on a Western blot, a single band of about 17 kDa was detected in both Extracts I and II (Fig. 5 b). We conclude that a low concentration of Mb is present in both Extracts I and II and that Extract I did not extract all the protein. Application of a mixture of BSA (66 kDa), horse Mb (17 kDa), and human Hb (65 kDa) to a Bio-Rad size exclusion column failed to isolate the Mb because of the partial dissociation of the human Hb tetramers to dimers, which caused the Mb and Hb peaks to overlap (data not shown). However, separation of horse Mb from BSA alone did occur (Fig. 6 a). When Extract I, after removal of Hb with the affinity column (see above), was applied to the SEC column (Fig. 6 b), a small shoulder on the human serum albumin peak corresponded in position to Mb. The amount of protein in this shoulder is roughly estimated to be about 10% of the serum albumin. Comparison of the quantity of serum albumin shown in Fig. 6allows us to estimate the quantity of Mb to be 0.16 mg/g wet tissue, a rough estimate at best because we are at the limit of detectability for the Mb. This difficulty does not compromise the estimation of Mb in skeletal muscle tissue because the latter contains a much larger quantity of Mb. Our results confirm the early report by Lankester (1870) that Mb occurs in human rectal smooth muscle (2Lankester E.R. Pflügers Arch. Gesamte Physiol. 1871; 4: 315-320Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 3Lankester E.R. Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1872; 21: 70-80Google Scholar), but only at very low concentrations. We show by immunohistological techniques that Mb is also present in all other smooth muscle tissues examined: colon, small intestine, uterus, bladder, arteries, and veins. Table I summarizes the presence and content of Mb in various tissues. However, attempts to quantify the Mb in the rectal tissue with existing protocols failed because they depended on the assumption that the only interfering heme-containing protein is Hb (13Schuder S. Wittenberg J.B. Haseltine B. Wittenberg B.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 92: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The procedure of de Duve (20de Duve C. Acta Chem. Scand. 1948; 2: 264-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which relies entirely on determination of hemin as the pyridine hemochromogen derivative, would also fail to measure Mb accurately. The reason for these failures is that substantial quantities of hemin-binding serum albumin can be present. The protocols do not distinguish between heme or hemin from Mb and from serum albumin. The procedure of Schuder et al. (13Schuder S. Wittenberg J.B. Haseltine B. Wittenberg B.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 92: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) adequately removes contaminating Hb by affinity chromatography but does not remove serum albumin. Therefore affinity separation followed by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 6) should be the method of choice to separate both of these contaminants from the much smaller Mb. Size exclusion chromatography alone is less satisfactory because of the tetramer to dimer dissociation of Hb.Table IMyoglobin reported for various tissuesMuscle TissueMb contentReferencemg/g wet weightHuman smooth Rectal+ immunohistochemical, mRNAPresent results Uterine smooth+ immunohistochemical, mRNAPresent results Uterine smooth0.2–0.65Jaisle F.

Open table in a new tab Southern hybridization with cDNA for human Mb gave a small but clear signal with tissue of the small intestine and uterus, a very weak signal from the colon, and none for the bladder, whereas the rectal smooth muscle gave a very strong signal. Several possible explanations for the large differences in mRNA may be suggested. Mb might be expressed only in special, as yet unspecified, metabolic circumstances. Alternatively, a small subset of cells in the rectal smooth muscle tissue might have a substantial content of Mb, but the analysis of a relatively large mass of tissue would provide only a diluted estimate of the Mb. The latter possibility is enhanced by studies of another tissue, the esophageal sphincter of the opossum, which has been extensively used as a model for the esophageal sphincter in man (21Christensen J. Freeman B.W. Miller J.K. Gastroenterology. 1973; 64: 1119-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Christensen J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1982; 170: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 23Christensen J. Conklin J.L. Freeman B.W. Am. J.

This sphincter may be similar to the rectal smooth muscle sphincter of man. The esophageal sphincter tissue of the opossum has several properties that distinguish it from the smooth muscle of the nearby esophageal body: 1) The rate of oxygen consumption of the sphincter tissue is higher than the esophageal body (25Schulze-Delrieu K. Crane S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: G258-G262PubMed Google Scholar). 2) The tonic contraction of the sphincter is entirely aerobic and cannot be maintained anaerobically. In contrast, the esophageal body contractions can be partially maintained anaerobically (22Christensen J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1982; 170: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 3) The apparent mitochondrial profile area is larger in the sphincter cells than in the esophageal body (26Christensen J. Roberts R.L. Gastroenterology. 1983; 85: 650-656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 4) Lactic dehydrogenase type I isozyme is present in the sphincter but not in the esophageal body (27Prasad R. Mukhopadhyay A. Prasad N. Experientia. 1978; 34: 484-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These observations show that the aerobic metabolism of the sphincter tissue is unique. Under aerobic conditions the muscle is tonically contracted and is only briefly relaxed to allow swallowing. The aerobic demand would make the presence of Mb advantageous. No similar metabolic studies of rectal tissue appear to have been made. The presence of mRNA for Mb in small intestine but not colon may be correlated with the different physiological functions of the tissues. Perhaps even a small amount of Mb may be advantageous in small intestine tissue but not colon. Peristaltic waves in the small intestine move at 1–2 cm/s over long periods of time, and the villi, present at a density of 10–40/mm2, have smooth muscle and contract independently almost continuously every 10 s (28Bloom W. Fawcett D.W. Textbook of Histology. 9th Ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA1968: 574Google Scholar). In contrast, the colon is devoid of villi, and muscular activity is infrequent. Our finding of some Mb in smooth muscle of arteries and veins suggests that it may play a role in limiting the time of vasodilation induced by nitric oxide delivered by S-nitrosohemoglobin (11Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar). NO reacts rapidly with MbO2 to form NO− and MetMb (29Doyle M.P. Hoekstra J.W. J.

The lifetime of NO in Mb-rich heart muscle is known to be short (31Kelm M. Schrader J. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 1561-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The vasodilation produced by NO depends on activation via cGMP of calcium-dependent potassium channels that cause hyperpolarization (32Cornfield D.N. Reeve H.L. Tolarova S. Weir E.K. Archer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8089-8094Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The presence of Mb should shorten the time of hyperpolarization. Lancaster (33Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8137-8141Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) has suggested that the action of NO may be restricted by Mb to localized areas of heart and skeletal muscle, a newly identified function for Mb. Similar localization may also occur in smooth muscle tissue. Mb should protect against the toxic effects of high NO production associated with tissue damage by accelerating its destruction. The proposed role of Mb in NO metabolism requires that the MetMb product be recycled. Ascorbate-mediated redox cycling of Mb has been shown to be capable of serving this function (34Galaris D. Cadenas E. Hochstein P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although the ascorbate content of human smooth muscle is not known, it is accumulated in many tissues and can reach concentrations of 300–800 μm in heart muscle and ∼200 μm in skeletal muscle (35Hornig D.

A single 4.2-kilobase mRNA detected in human articular cartilage encodes a polypeptide of 1184 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 132.5 kDa. The protein has a putative signal peptide of 21 amino acids, and is a proform of two polypeptides. The amino-terminal half corresponds to CILP (molecular mass of 78.5 kDa, not including post-translational modifications) and the carboxyl-terminal half corresponds to a protein homologous to a porcine nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase, NTPPHase (molecular mass of 51.8 kDa, not including post-translational modifications). CILP has 30 cysteines and six putative N-glycosylation sites. The human homolog of porcine NTPPHase described here contains 10 cysteine residues and two putative N-glycosylation sites. In the precursor protein the NTPPHase region is immediately preceded by a tetrapeptide conforming to a furin proteinase cleavage consensus sequence. Expression of the full-length cDNA in a cell-free translation system and in COS-7 or EBNA cells indicates that the precursor protein is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain that is processed, possibly by a furin-like protease, into two polypeptides upon or preceding secretion.

Articular cartilage is a tissue that varies in composition with site, e.g. from the surface to the deep zone and also from the pericellular environment close to the cells to the more distant interterritorial matrix (1Heinegård D. Bayliss M.T. Lorenzo P. Brant K. Doherty M. Lohmander S. Osteoarthritis. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 74-84Google Scholar, 2Hedlund H. Mengarelli-Widholm S. Reinholt F. Svensson O. APMIS. 1993; 101: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The major constituents of the matrix are collagens (reviewed in Ref. 3Van der Rest M. Garrone R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2814-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar) and large aggregating proteoglycans that contain large numbers of chondroitin sulfate chains (reviewed in Ref. 4Heinegård D. Björnsson S. Mörgelin M. Sommarin Y. Laurent T. The Chemistry, Biology and Medical Applications of Hyaluronan and Its Derivatives. 1998: 113-122Google Scholar). A third set of molecules are the non-collagenous glycoproteins including several members of the family of leucine-rich repeat proteins and the thrombospondins. The leucine-rich repeat proteins include decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, and lumican, all with the capacity to bind to collagen (for Refs. see Ref. 1Heinegård D. Bayliss M.T. Lorenzo P. Brant K. Doherty M. Lohmander S. Osteoarthritis. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 74-84Google Scholar). These molecules are found along surfaces of collagen fibrils in the tissue. Other members of this family that do not bind to collagen include chondroadherin (5Neame P. Sommarin Y. Boynton R.E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21547-21554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PRELP (6Bengtsson E. Neame P. Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. J. Biol.

The thrombospondin family includes the pentameric COMP, which is one of the more abundant cartilage matrix proteins (7Hedbom E. Antonsson P. Hjerpe A. Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Rosa-Pimentel E.

Commun. 1988; 153: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). There are also a number of other proteins that may not be part of the described families. One such protein is the cartilage intermediate layer protein (CILP),1previously identified and purified from human articular cartilage (25Lorenzo P. Bayliss M.T. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23463-23468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In most cases the structure and function of these proteins are not known. However, detailed knowledge of their structure, function, and variability in normal conditions as well as in disease is of fundamental importance to define mechanisms and events occurring in joint disease. Interestingly, in joint disease, such as osteoarthrosis there are major alterations in the composition of the cartilage extracellular matrix. These changes reflect an altered homeostasis, probably a reason for the defective repair (1Heinegård D. Bayliss M.T. Lorenzo P. Brant K. Doherty M. Lohmander S. Osteoarthritis. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 74-84Google Scholar). Our preliminary studies have shown that in early osteoarthrosis there are a set of proteins, in which synthesis and content are increased in early osteoarthrosis cartilage. 2P. Lorenzo, M. Bayliss, and D. Heinegård, unpublished data.2P. Lorenzo, M. Bayliss, and D. Heinegård, unpublished data. One of these proteins is CILP. The present paper describes the cloning and expression in vitro in cell-free and in cells of CILP. The mRNA for CILP was found to also code for a protein homologous to an ectonucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase recently cloned and partially sequenced from porcine chondrocytes (10Masuda I. Halligan B.D. Barbieri J.T. Haas A.L. Ryan L.M. McCarty D.J. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 197: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the precursor protein is synthesized by human chondrocytes and processed in close association to secretion. The experimental procedures for the isolation and purification of CILP were as described (25Lorenzo P. Bayliss M.T. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23463-23468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Proteolytic digestion with Lys-C was performed at enzyme:substrate ratios of 1:50 according to the manufacture's instructions. Peptides were separated by reversed phase HPLC on a Vydac C18 column (2.1 × 30 mm), eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile (0–70% over 45 min) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The effluent was monitored at 220 nm. Peptides were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 477A automated sequencer with on-line analysis of phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives on an Applied Biosystems 120A microbore HPLC. All the molecular biological procedures, including agarose gel electrophoresis, restriction enzyme digestion, ligation, bacterial transformation, and DNA sequencing, were performed by standard methods (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Human articular cartilage was obtained at surgery after total hip replacement, kept in phosphate-buffered saline during dissection, shaved, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted essentially as described by Adams et al. (14Adams M.E. Huang D.Q. Yao L.Y. Sandell L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) but omitting the cesium trifluoroacetic acetate ultracentrifugation step. Instead, the RNA was precipitated twice with 1 volume of 100% isopropyl alcohol, then further purified with a RNA easy kit (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturers' protocol. The mRNA was purified from this preparation using the Oligotex mRNA kit (QIAGEN Inc.) by following the manufacturers' protocol. Total RNA isolated from human articular cartilage was used as the template for the synthesis of the first-strand cDNA. Total RNA (20 μg) was reverse-transcribed using 400 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies Inc) in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 100 ng of oligo(dT), and 300 ng of random hexamer primers, 1 mm dNTP, for 1 h at 37 °C (15Lee C.H. Caskey C.T. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed with degenerate primers (forward and reverse, 1 μm each), 5 μl of cDNA, 0.2 mm dNTP mixture, 1 unit of Taq polymerase, 5 μl of 10 × Taq reaction buffer, 1.5 mmMgCl2, in a 50-μl reaction mixture. After an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles of amplification were performed in a Hybaid OmniGene thermocycler at the following conditions: 94 °C for 30 s, 48 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min. Ten percent of the products from the first amplification were re-amplified for an additional 25 cycles under the same cycling conditions. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel (NuSieve GTG, FMC Corp.). The main product (800 bp) was subcloned into a pCR-Script Amp SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced in both directions by using the standard double-stranded dideoxy chain termination method. The deduced amino acid sequence of the 800-bp cDNA fragment contained some of the peptide internal sequences. The fragment was used as a probe to screen a λZAP II cDNA library made from human chondrocytes, kindly provided by Dr. Michael Bayliss (16Charles I.G. Palmer R.M.J. Hickery M.S. Bayliss M.T. Chubb A.P. Hall V.S. Moss D.W. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11419-11423Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 × 106 plaque forming recombinants were screened. One positive clone was found (named 92C-1). The plasmid pBluescript II SK(+) containing the insert was rescued from the ZAP vector by the use of in vivo excision as described in the ZAP-cDNA® synthesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The plasmid was digested with XbaI/XhoI and the cDNA size (2.3 kb) was determined by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. Restriction fragments were generated with BamHI and subcloned into a pCR-Script Amp SK(+). Sequencing was performed as described above, compression artifacts were resolved using the dITP kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). The sequencing primers used included T3 and T7 universal primers and internal sequencing primers. The 2.3-kb clone was used to generate a 314-bp PCR probe with primers designed toward the 3-′ end. The probe was used for rescreening the human chondrocyte λZAP II cDNA library as described. One 1.6-kb clone (named 92C-2) was isolated, subcloned, and sequenced. Sequence analyses were carried out using the PCGene Program package (Intelligenetics). Similarity searches were performed by the use of the E-mail service at the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the BLAST program. The Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) was used to obtain a library of adaptor-ligated double-stranded cDNA from human articular cartilage. One microgram of poly(A)+ RNA was used as template for the first strand synthesis as described byCLONTECH in the manual for the Marathon cDNA amplification kit, 5′- and 3′-RACE. The 5′- and 3′-ends were PCR amplified using 3 μl of the library as the template with the primer supplied by CLONTECH(AP1) and 0.2 μm each of the gene-specific primers (5′-RACE, 5′-GTACAATGGGGGCAAACTTGACCTT-3′ from 835 to 859 bp and 3′-RACE, 5′-TCATGAAGAGCAATGTGGGAGTAGC-3′, from 3317 to 3341 bp (Fig. 2), 0.2 mm dNTP mixture, 5 μl of 10 × reaction buffer, and 1.25 units of cloned Pfu DNA Polymerase (Stratagene) in a 50-μl reaction volume. After an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 1 min, 30 cycles of amplification were performed using the following conditions: 94 °C for 45 s, 65 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 4 min. The PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel, isolated, and subcloned into pCR-Script Amp SK(+). Sequencing of both strands was performed by AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase, FS (Perkin-Elmer) using fluorescent dye termination sequencing chemistry and analysis of the reaction products on an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer. The sequencing primers used included T3 and T7 universal primers and internal sequencing primers. Three genomic clones subcloned in the bacteriophage P1 were obtained from Genome Systems, Inc. Screening Services (St. Louis, MO). One clone containing the gene for CILP was used for isolation of a XhoI/EcoRI fragment containing the 3′-end. The fragment, GXRI, was subcloned into pBluescript II KS(+) and used for the construction of the expression vectors (Fig. 1). Ten micrograms of total RNA isolated from human articular cartilage were electrophoresed on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (NitroPure, Micron Separation), and hybridized with random-primed [α-32P]dCTP probe of 1585-bpBsmI/EcoRI fragment from the 92C-1 clone. After hybridization, the membrane was washed twice at 42 °C for 15 min with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min, then with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and finally with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and exposed to x-ray film (X-Omat AR, Kodak). A full-length cDNA for expression studies in three vectors was constructed as schematically depicted in Fig. 1. In pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene), clone 92C-2 was digested withXhoI, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, extracted with phenol, and then digested with AvrII. The released fragment (1081 bp) was separated by agarose electrophoresis isolated and ligated into the clone 92C-1, previously digested withSmaI/AvrII. The insert was then released withXhoI and ligated into another pBluescript II KS(+) containing a 606-bp XhoI/EcoRI fragment of the human CILP gene containing the 3′-end. The use of this genomic fragment (606 bp) was for convenience. It did not contain any intron and its sequence was identical to the 3PM clone except for the poly(A) tail. 3P. Lorenzo, P. Åman, Y. Sommarin, and D. Heinegård, unpublished data. The 5′-end was amplified by PCR using the 5′ Marathon Clone (5PM) as a template with a forward primer at the position 97 with a ClaI site introduced, and a reverse primer at the position 843 at theSauI site. The generated 746-bp PCR fragment was ligated in the recombinant clone. To make a construct in the pSVL SV40 Late Promoter Expression Vector (Pharmacia Biotech), the pBluescript II KS(+) bearing the full-length CILP cDNA was digested with SalI/SacI. The generated fragment was ligated into the pSVL SV40 previously digested with XhoI/SacI. The 746-bp fragmentClaI/SauI was then added. In pCEP 4 (Invitrogen) the full-length CILP cDNA was ligated into theNotI/KpnI site. All three vectors containing full-length CILP cDNA were checked by standard sequencing with forward and reverse primers that covered the ligation sites. The plasmid pBluescript II KS(+) with the expression construct (Fig. 1) wasin vitro transcribed/translated with TNT® T3 Polymerase (TNT® T3 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System, Promega). Supercoiled plasmid (500 ng) was used according to the manufacturers' protocol. The 25-μl reaction mixture contained 12.5 μl of TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate, TNT reaction buffer, T3 RNA polymerase, RNasin® 20 Units, amino acid mixture without methionine, supplemented with [35S]methionine as the radioactive precursor (1000 Ci/mmol). After 90 min incubation at 30 °C, labeled polypeptides were separated from free amino acids by ethanol precipitation (10 volumes of ethanol containing 50 mm sodium acetate). Precipitates were resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer (2% SDS, 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.002% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol) without or with 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled at 100 °C for 4 min, and electrophoresed on 4–16% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and visualized by fluorography (17Chamberlain J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). A control reaction with the pBluescript II KS(+) plasmid only was run simultaneously. The monkey kidney-derived cell line, COS-7, was grown in F-12/Dulbecco's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml) at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Semiconfluent cells were transfected by using the LipofectAMINE method, as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.), with either 6 μg of pSVL SV40 vector containing the expression construct or 6 μg of pSVL SV40 vector only. After 72 h post-transfection the cells were labeled with [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol) in a methionine-free medium. After 8 h labeling the medium was removed, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with RIPA buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7). Medium and cell extract were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against CILP (25Lorenzo P. Bayliss M.T. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23463-23468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The precipitated products were electrophoresed on a 4–16% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by fluorography. For control, the cells were transfected with the respective vector lacking the cDNA insert. Human embryonic kidney cells, 293-EBNA (Invitrogen), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), and 250 μg/ml Geneticin. When the cells were semi-confluent they were stably transfected by using the LipofectAMINE method with either 5 μg of the pCEP4 vector containing the expression construct or 5 μg of the pCEP4 vector only. The cells were selected with 300 μg/ml hygromycin. After 1 week of transfection the expression of CILP was analyzed by immunoblotting the medium. A synthetic peptide (EDRTFLVGNLEIRERRLFNC), apart from an extra COOH-terminal cysteine residue, spanning amino acid residues 704–722 corresponding to the human homologous NH2-terminal of NTPPHase (Fig. 2) was coupled to KLH through the carboxyl-terminal cysteine residue with the SPDP cross-linker (Saveen Biotech AB, Malmö, Sweden), and used to generate a rabbit polyclonal antiserum. We were unable to determine the NH2-terminal of CILP, suggesting that it may be blocked. Alternatively, the NH2-terminal may be rather heterogeneous as a result of proteolytic cleavage. After Lys-C digestion of intact protein, peptides were separated by reversed phase HPLC, peaks were collected by hand and 14 were analyzed, only 11 peaks gave readable sequences. Some peaks gave two sequences, but by analysis of the relative yields of the amino acids at each cycle, it was possible to determine both sequences with a high degree of confidence. As the protein was not reduced and carboxymethylated, no peptides were isolated that contained cysteines. Eleven of the sequenced peptides could be aligned against the translated cDNA sequence (Table I and Fig. 2). It should be noted that all the peptides sequenced were located within the first 680 amino acids.Table IAmino acid sequences of CILP peptides after proteolytic digestidon with Lys-CPeptideSequencePosition at the deduced amino acid sequence3302AEFVDAETPYMVMNPETXK280–2973304FAPIVLDMPK261–2703305NPSIFAK18–243306YFWYHxTTLLDPSLYK320–3353307GTFTLHVPQDTERLVLTFVDRLQK483–5063308PADTLESPMEXTT25–373310EPITLEAMETNIIPLGEVVGH534–5533314LWSLNPDTGLeeegxf657–6733315LVLRK340–3443317ATGKPRPdk311–3193318VHLDSTQVKMPhistvk639–673Lower case means uncertain.

One peptide (3306, Table I) contained a blank cycle which on subsequent analysis of the translated cDNA sequence proved to be the asparagine of a carbohydrate N-linkage site. This site is therefore likely to contain an N-linked oligosaccharide. Total RNA isolated from human articular cartilage was used as the template for synthesis of the first-strand cDNA with both oligo(dT) and random hexamers as primers. The cDNA was used for PCR amplification with degenerate primers based on the amino acid sequences LHVPQDT, EAMETN, and PYMVMNP. A 830-bp PCR fragment was amplified, isolated, and ligated into pCR-Script Amp SK(+). The fragment covered nucleotides between 926 and 1756 bp (Fig. 2). The translated sequence contained several of the determined amino acid sequences (Table I, Fig. 2). Two overlapping clones (92C-1 and 92C-2, Fig. 1) were isolated by screening with the 830-bp PCR fragment approximately 1 × 106 clones from a human articular chondrocyte λZAP-cDNA library. These clones encode most of the cDNA sequence for CILP (Fig. 1). However, the first methionine did not conform to the Kozak consensus and no signal peptide and no poly(A)-tail was detected. No full-length clone was found after extensive rescreening of the cDNA library. The 5′- and 3′-ends were generated by the RACE technique. The 5′-end obtained was a fragment of 988 bp (5PM, Fig. 1) that contained the first ATG codon and a putative signal peptide. The 3′-end obtained was a cDNA fragment of 730 bp (3PM, Fig. 1) that contained a poly(A) tail. An overview of the cloning strategy is given in Fig. 1. All cDNA fragments were sequenced in full. The resulting nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 2. The identity of the clones with the isolated protein was verified by the partial amino acid sequences from the protein, as indicated in Fig. 2. The full-length cDNA encoded a total of 4175 bp with an open reading frame starting with the first ATG codon at the position 130 and ending at position 3681 with a TAA codon. The sequence flanking the first ATG codon conforms to the consensus sequence for initiation of translation proposed by Kozak (18Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar), (A/G)XX AUGG. The open reading frame coded for a protein of 1184 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 132.5 kDa. Prediction of the eukaryotic secretory signal sequence according to Von Heijne (19von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3685) Google Scholar) indicated a putative cleavage site between amino acids 21 and 22. The protein contains 40 cysteine residues which are likely to be involved in disulfide bond formation. Many of these are located toward the NH2-terminal part of the molecule. There are eight consensus sites for N-glycosylation, and the calculated isoelectric point is 8.31. A 3′-noncoding region of 493 bp downstream of the stop codon contained three consensus sequences for polyadenylation, 5′-AATAAA-3′, at positions 3740–3745, 4003–4008, and 4011–4016 followed by a short poly(A) stretch located 17 bp after the last polyadenylation signal. Nucleotide and amino acid similarity searches were made against the GenBank data bases at The National Center for Biotechnology Information, using the BLAST network service (20Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). Toward the NH2 terminus of the molecule there is a stretch of 27 amino acids, from 131 to 157, shown in Fig. 2, which is related to the Type I repeats of thrombospondin (21Lawler J. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1635-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The COOH terminus of the molecule showed very high similarity (90%) to a porcine ectonucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase, NTPPHase (10Masuda I. Halligan B.D. Barbieri J.T. Haas A.L. Ryan L.M. McCarty D.J. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 197: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Based on the biochemical characterization of CILP, which has an apparent molecular mass of 92 kDa (25Lorenzo P. Bayliss M.T. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23463-23468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and on the NH2-terminal sequence reported for a catalytically active proteolytic fragment of the porcine NTPPHase (22Masuda I. Hamada J. Haas A.L. Ryan L.M. McCarty D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 699-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it appears that CILP is synthesized as a proform that also contains a protein homologous to a porcine enzyme with NTPPHase activity. In fact the precursor protein has a consensus sequence for precursor cleavage catalyzed by furin (23Hosaka M. Nagahama M. Kim W. Watanabe T. Hatsuzawa K. Ikemizu J. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12127-12130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),i.e. RX(K/R)R, from positions 700 to 703 (RNKR). Directly following the furin consensus cleavage site is the start of the region with homology to the NH2 terminus of the NTPPHase (22Masuda I. Hamada J. Haas A.L. Ryan L.M. McCarty D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 699-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteolytic fragment of the porcine enzyme has a molecular mass of 61 kDa (22Masuda I. Hamada J. Haas A.L. Ryan L.M. McCarty D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 699-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which is in agreement with the calculated molecular mass of 51.8 kDa of the translated sequence from base 2173 to base 3552 and assuming carbohydrate substitutions at two putativeN-glycosylation sites. Northern blotting of total RNA from human articular cartilage, using a 1585-bp BsmI/EcoRI fragment from clone 92C-1 as the probe, indicated that there is a single mRNA of approximately 4.2 kb (Fig. 3). This size agrees well with the total number of nucleotides sequenced, indicating that most of the mRNA is covered by the cDNA clones. The full-length cDNA, coding for CILP, and for the protein homologous to the porcine NTPPHase was expressed in vitro both in cell-free and in cells. When the protein was expressed in vitro by using a cell-free transcription-translation system in the presence of [35S]methionine, a single labeled peptide with an apparent molecular mass of 123 kDa was detected (Fig. 4 A). The processing of the precursor protein was studied by expressing the cDNA construct transiently and stably, in two different cell lines. With COS-7 cells, analysis by immunoprecipitation of cell extracts and medium with polyclonal antibodies against CILP showed that the precursor protein was secreted to the medium in three forms (Fig. 4 C). One component had molecular mass slightly larger in size (e.g. 138 kDa) than the in vitro translated product and probably represents the precursor protein with post-translational modifications. Two smaller components had apparent molecular masses of 92 and 82 kDa, respectively. The component of 92 kDa represents the expected size for CILP. In the cell extract the major component was the higher molecular mass product (138 kDa, Fig. 4 B), even though small amounts of the two components of lower molecular mass could be seen (92 and 82 kDa, respectively). The processing of the precursor protein was further analyzed by immunoblotting of the medium from 293-EBNA cells after stable transfection and expression (Fig. 5). The polyclonal antibodies against CILP recognized a major component with a molecular mass corresponding to isolated CILP, C1 (Fig. 5 A). An additional immunoreactive component of lower molecular mass (e.g. C2, 82 kDa) was present in a lower proportion (Fig. 5 A). This lower molecular mass component is not a result of different glycosylation of CILP, since after digestion withN-glycanase both proteins similarly changed their electrophoretic mobility (data not shown). It is likely then that this form is generated by alternative cleavage of the precursor protein. With antibodies generated against the synthetic peptide EDRTFLVGNLEIRERRLFNC (Fig. 5 B), corresponding to the NH2 terminus of NTPPHase region, a major component with a molecular mass about 60 kDa (N2, Fig. 5 B) was detected. An additional minor component with slightly lower mobility (N1, Fig. 5 B) was recognized by the antibody. The molecular mass of the major band (60 kDa, N2) correspond to that reported for a proteolytic fragment of the porcine NTPPHase (22Masuda I. Hamada J. Haas A.L. Ryan L.M. McCarty D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 699-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of these two forms of CILP as well as the putative NTPPHase, differing in size, suggests an alternative cleavage site of the precursor protein. There are basic di- and tri-peptides, between residues 538–539 and 551–553 (Fig. 2) that may represent cleavage sites for furin-like proteinases. These sites are 164 and 150 amino acids upstream of the furin proteinase cleavage consensus sequence. Cleavage at either of these sites would alter the molecular mass by 16.4 and 15 kDa, respectively. These values correspond well to the difference in apparent molecular mass between the observed CILP forms as well as the NTPPHase forms detected by the respective antibodies,i.e. 92 kDa versus 82 kDa for CILP. In summary, these experiments show that the precursor protein is fully cleaved by the 293-EBNA cells into two components that are secreted to the medium with no detectable precursor present. Isolation and peptide mapping of CILP enabled us to define probes and primers for characterization of the full-length cDNA coding for a novel extracellular matrix macromolecule. This protein acts as a precursor for two different proteins. The cloning of a cDNA of 4175 bp that is transcribed to a single mRNA species of the same size indicates that the mRNA encodes a larger protein than expected for CILP. This was verified by the complete deduced amino acid sequence. The polypeptide consists of 1184 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 132.5 kDa. Thus, the precursor protein is made of CILP (molecular mass of 78.5 kDa, without post-translational modifications) and a protein homologous to a nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase (NTPPHase) described in porcine chondrocytes (10Masuda I. Halligan B.D. Barbieri J.T. Haas A.L. Ryan L.M. McCarty D.J. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 197: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The proteolytic fragment of the porcine NTPPHase was suggested to be derived from a larger matrix vesicle-associated protein of apparent molecular mass of 127 kDa (22Masuda I. Hamada J. Haas A.L. Ryan L.M. McCarty D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 699-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study the human homolog of the porcine NTPPHase has 460 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 51.8 kDa, without post-translational modifications. In the precursor protein described here, the two proteins appear to be generated after proteolytic cleavage at a tetrapeptide conforming to a furin proteinase cleavage consensus sequence RX(K/R)R (RNKR, spanning amino acids 700 to 703 in Fig. 2) with basic amino acids in positions −4, −2, and −1 relative to the cleavage site (23Hosaka M. Nagahama M. Kim W. Watanabe T. Hatsuzawa K. Ikemizu J. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12127-12130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This motif is conserved in a number of constitutively processed precursors. Whether the presently described precursor protein is cleaved by furin or furin-like proteases synthesized by human chondrocytes remains to be established. The precursor protein is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain as shown by in vitro cell-free expression. The precursor protein is cleaved to the two proteins in the cell systems used for expression. The presence of small amounts of the cleaved products in the COS-7 cell extract upon transient expression indicates that the cleavage occurs already intracellularly, probably immediately prior to secretion. Both products, CILP and the homologous NTPPHase, are fully secreted from the cells as shown in the two cell systems used for the study of the expression of the protein. Only in the COS-7 cells a proportion of the precursor protein is secreted into the medium, possibly a result from a limited capacity to process the high-level of protein expressed in these cells after transfection. More complete processing was accomplished in the EBNA cells, where the proform of the protein was not secreted into the medium. After processing, a product corresponding to CILP isolated from human articular cartilage (92 kDa) and a smaller variant (82 kDa) were detected by the polyclonal antibody against CILP. The smaller product may be formed by an alternative cleavage site used by the proteases in the expression system. Since this smaller form is not detected in explants of human articular cartilage it either has a faster turnover or the processing enzymes in human articular chondrocytes are more specific than those in the EBNA cells. Alternative putative cleavage site spanning amino acids 538–539 or 551–553 (Fig. 2) might be targeted in the cell lines used. CILP is processed by the cells into a single polypeptide chain with a calculated molecular mass of 78.5 kDa. It is slightly basic with an isoelectric point of 8.15. It contains 6 putativeN-glycosylation sites which is consistent with a molecular mass of 92 kDa, the apparent molecular mass of the protein purified from human articular cartilage (25Lorenzo P. Bayliss M.T. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23463-23468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) after post-translational modifications. The protein contains 30 cysteine residues mostly distributed toward the NH2-terminal half of the molecule. Due to the special role of cysteine residues for protein structure, the high content of these amino acids indicates a high degree of intrachain disulfide cross-bridging. The NH2-terminal domain of CILP containing the Type 1 thrombospondin-like repeat and 16 cysteines is associated with a strikingly hydrophobic region from amino acids 130–225. Following this, a relatively exposed region may lead to another compact, disulfide-bonded region between residues 354 and 445. Another extended region with no cysteines leads to the very basic furin-type cleavage site. The lack of similarities between CILP and other proteins of defined structure neither allowed us to predict a secondary structure nor any remarkable structural feature or function. There is a homology to the Type 1 repeats of thrombospondin in the consensus sequence for heparin binding (24Guo N. Krutzs H.C. Nègre E. Zabrenetzky V.S. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19349-19355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), from residues 131 to 135 (WSPWS), but we have no experimental evidence that CILP actually binds to heparin. The human homolog of the nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase (NTPPHase) that forms the COOH-terminal of CILP is made of 460 amino acid residues, with a calculated molecular mass of 51.8 kDa, and an isoelectric point 8.73. It has 10 cysteine residues and two putativeN-glycosylation sites. This is in close agreement with the molecular mass estimate for the catalytically active fragment of the porcine NTPPHase (22Masuda I. Hamada J. Haas A.L. Ryan L.M. McCarty D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 699-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of CILP in EBNA cells will allow us to isolate the protein under native conditions and to subsequently study its structure and function as well as its involvement in tissue homeostasis and diseases."

(1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 33698–33704). Based on the two consensus sites for protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation in the C-terminal region mutant HAhIPs were generated: S328A and S374A, in which an alanine replaced Ser-328 or Ser-374, respectively, S328A/S374A and C-DEL, in which the C-terminal portion was truncated at amino acid 313. Mutant receptors, stably expressed in HEK293 cells, coupled normally to cAMP production. Substantially less coupling to inositol phosphate was apparent with S328A, S328A/S374A, and C-DEL compared with HAhIP or S374A. Point mutants resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a broad band with a molecular mass of 44–62, indicating that the receptors are glycosylated, and immunofluoresence staining demonstrated their membrane localization. C-DEL demonstrated a substantial reduction in glycosylation; bands with molecular masses of 38–54 (glycosylated), 30, and 27 kDa (unglycosylated) were apparent. Although membrane localization was evident, cellular localization was more diffuse. HAhIP and S374A underwent iloprost- and PMA-induced phosphorylation (1 and 5 μm, respectively, for 10 min). S328A and S328A/S374A showed a markedly less iloprost- and no PMA-induced phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of C-DEL was completely absent with either agonist. Electrospray mass spectrometry indicated that a peptide, including Ser-328, was phosphorylated in vitro by PKC, whereas one including Ser-374 was not.Iloprost (1 μm, 10 min) desensitized HAhIP- and S374A-mediated adenylyl cyclase activation. A less impressive desensitization was evident with S328A and S328A/S374A, and no desensitization of C-DEL coupling was apparent. Exposure of transfected cells to iloprost (1 μm) for increasing times induced a rapid desensitization of subsequent iloprost-induced (1 μm) HAhIP and S374A adenylyl cyclase coupling. In contrast, no significant time-dependent desensitization of S328A, S328A/S374A, or C-DEL coupling was evident.

The human prostacyclin receptor (hIP),1 thought to mediate the potent anti-platelet, vasodilator, and anti-inflammatory actions of prostacyclin, is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. Studies have demonstrated that the IP is coupled to stimulation of both adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C (PLC) (1Boie Y. Rushmore T.H. Darmon-Goodwin A. Grygorczyk R. Sliptez D.M. Metters K.M.

This involves rapid receptor phosphorylation, which results in uncoupling of receptor-G protein interactions (4Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-353PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequent receptor internalization. These events result in a diminished response to agonist. Thereafter, GPCRs may be degraded and/or recycled (5Koenig J.A. Edwards J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Generally, at least two classes of kinases may participate in GPCR phosphorylation: second messenger-dependent kinases, such as PKC and protein kinase A, and the GPCR kinases (GRKs) (4Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-353PubMed Google Scholar). For example, β-adrenoreceptors may be phosphorylated and desensitized by the sequential action of protein kinase A and GRKs 2 and 3 (6Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G.

In this study, we investigated further the pathways involved in hIP regulation and their implications for regulation of receptor function. Mutants of the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged hIP were used to investigate the role of phosphorylation in desensitization of the hIP. We identified a single site of PKC-dependent phosphorylation as a critical determinant for desensitization of this biologically important (14Murata T. Ushikubi F. Matsuoka T. Hirata M. Tamaska A.

Iloprost, the cAMP radioimmunoassay and the enhanced chemiluminesence kits, as well as all radiochemicals, were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Monoclonal anti-HA (16B12 clone) was obtained from the Berkley Antibody Company (Richmond, CA). A Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and the TA cloning kit and pcDNA III were obtained from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Deoxycholic acid, isobutylmethylxanthine, ATP, cAMP, GTP, alumina, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylserine were all purchased from Sigma. All cell culture reagents, G418, and Albumax were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Protein G-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and complete protease inhibitor tablets were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. AG 1-X8 resin (formate form) and AG W-X4 resin (hydrogen form) were purchased from Bio-Rad. The hIP cDNA was generously donated by Dr. Kathleen Metters (Merck Frosst, Quebec, Canada). Peptides and oligonucleotides were from Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). HEK 293 cells (American Type Tissue Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 25 mm HEPES, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were seeded at 1.5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and transfected with 100 μg/dish DNA by liposome-mediated transfer (DOTAP; Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions the next day. The media were replaced after approximately 6 h with fresh DMEM containing 1.5 mg/ml G418. Several resistant clones, arising from single cells, were selected within 15–20 days and expanded. The G418 concentration was maintained at 1 mg/ml in the cell culture medium. Targeted mutagenesis of the cDNA encoding HAhIP, in the mammalian expression vector pcDNAIII (HAhIPpcDNAIII; Ref. 3Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33698-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), was performed using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit with appropriate oligonucleotides. We replaced Ser-328 and Ser-374 within the putative consensus sites for PKC phosphorylation in the C-terminal tail with alanines either alone or in combination. This resulted in the following mutants: HAhIPS328A (S328A) containing the serine 328 to alanine substitution, HAhIPS374A (S374A) containing the serine 374 to alanine substitution and HAhIPS328A/S374A (S328A/S374A) containing both substitutions. The C-terminal region of HAhIP was deleted by the introduction of a stop codon (TGA) at residue 313 using the polymerase chain reaction. The 5′-oligonucleotide (5′-CCTGGCGTCCATGCTCATCC-3′) contained 20 bases, which were just upstream of a uniqueEco47III site in the hIP cDNA sequence (1Boie Y. Rushmore T.H. Darmon-Goodwin A. Grygorczyk R. Sliptez D.M. Metters K.M. Abramovitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12173-12178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′-oligonucleotide (5′-TTAGGATCCATCAGAGGCACAGGCAGCAGAC-3′) contained 3 miscellaneous bases, a BamHI site, 1 miscellaneous base, 3 bases complimentary to a stop codon, and 18 bases complimentary to hIP amino acids 312 to 307. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out using the HAhIP cDNA as a template. Following cloning into pCR3.1, using the TA cloning kit, the EcoN47III-BamHI fragment was purified and ligated into HAhIPpcDNAIII, cut with the same enzymes, to give rise to a mutant termed HAhIPCDEL (C-DEL). Generation of the desired mutation(s) (Fig. 1) was confirmed by sequencing the region of interest. Membranes were prepared from confluent 100-mm dishes as follows. Cells were washed once with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 20 mm Tris pH 7.4, containing 1 tablet/50 ml complete protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were lysed for 15 s with a Tissue Tearor (Biospec Products, Inc, Bartlesville, OK) on ice, and unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation 500 × g at 4 °C. Membrane fractions collected at 115,000 × g (1 h at 4 °C). The resulting pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and stored at −80 °C for further use. Cells grown in slide chamber assemblies (Nunc, Napierville, IL) were fixed and permeabilized with ice-cold 70% methanol, 30% acetone for 10 min at −20 °C and 5 min at room temperature. Fixed sections were treated with anti-HA (1/2000) in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature, and after being washed three times, each for 10 min, in phosphate-buffered saline, antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (1/500; Jackson Immunology, Westgrove, PA). Slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) and examined by fluorescence or confocal microscopy. Cells grown to confluence in 24-well plates were treated with iloprost (10 min at 37 °C). Reactions were terminated by aspiration and cAMP extracted with ice-cold 65% ethanol for 30 min. Samples were dried under vacuum, reconstituted in assay buffer, and cAMP was quantified by radioimmunoassay (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An exception was that half the recommended amounts of binding protein and3H-cAMP tracer were used in the samples and standards. Adenylyl cyclase activity was assayed by a modification of the method of Solomon et al.(15Solomon T. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 58: 541-548Crossref Scopus (3367) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out in 50 mm Tris containing 3 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm EDTA, 0.15 mm ATP, 0.05 mm GTP, 0.1 mm cAMP, 2.8 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 0.1 mmisobutylmethylxanthine. Each reaction contained 1 unit of myokinase, 1 unit of pyruvate kinase, and 2 μCi [α32-P]ATP (30 Ci/mmol). Reactions were started by the addition of membranes (5 μg per assay tube), prepared as outlined above, and after 30 min at 30 °C, were quenched by the addition of 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 30,000 CPM [3H]cAMP (41 Ci/mmol) . Samples were subjected to sequential chromatography through Dowex (AG W-X4, hydrogen form) and alumina (WN-6, neutral) columns as described (15Solomon T. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 58: 541-548Crossref Scopus (3367) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were eluted onto alumina with 3 ml of H2O following application to Dowex columns and one wash with 2.5 ml of H2O. Cyclic AMP was eluted from the alumina columns with 4 ml of 0.1 mm imidazole (pH 7.5).32P and 3H in the eluates were estimated by scintillation counting. Recovery of cAMP from the columns was monitored by measuring the level of [3H]cAMP in each sample. Cells grown to 70–80% confluence in 12-well plates coated with 0.2% gelatin were labeled overnight with 2 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol in DMEM (without inositol) containing 0.5% albumax, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. 30 min before stimulation, cells were treated with 20 mm LiCl at 37 °C. After stimulation for 10 min at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by aspiration. Total inositol phosphates were extracted with 750 μl of 10 mm formic acid for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were neutralized (final pH 8–9) with 3 ml 10 mm ammonia. Total inositol phosphates were recovered by anion exchange using Dowex 1-X8 AG anion exchange resin (formate form). Samples were applied to the resin, washed with 40 mm formic acid/ammonium formate (pH 5), and finally the inositol phosphates were eluted with 2m formic acid/ammonium formate (pH 5) (16Seuwen K.

They were resolved (50 μg per lane) on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose. HA-tagged receptors were visualized by treating immunoblots with anti-HA (1:1500 dilution) in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mm Tris, 250 mmNaCl, pH 7.6) containing 1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 60 min at room temperature followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:5000 dilution; Jackson Immunology), after first blocking with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T for 2 h at room temperature. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. All immunoprecipitation procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The cells were lysed (RIPA: 50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1 tablet/50 ml complete protease inhibitor mixture, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 mmNaH2P2O7), drawn though a 23-gauge needle 6 times and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm. The resulting supernatants were precleared by adding 100 μl of 10% (w/v) protein G-Sepharose to each tube and rotating for 60 min. Anti-HA-protein G-Sepharose was prepared by adding 1 μl anti-HA ascites per lysate to 10% protein G-Sepharose and rotating it for 60 min. The HAhIP was immunoprecipitated from precleared lysates by adding 100 μl of the anti-HA-protein G-Sepharose to each lysate and rotating for 2 h. Protein G was precipitated at 14,000 rpm for 1 min, washed three times with RIPA buffer, and finally resuspended in 60 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.002% bromphenol blue, 100 mm dithiothreitol). Samples were then boiled for 10 min and subjected to electrophoresis as outlined above. Gels were dried for phosphorimaging. Cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and grown to 70–80% confluence. 32P-labeling was carried out using 150–200 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate in phosphate-free DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Fisher, Malvern, PA) for 60 min at 37 °C. Labeled cells were treated with the stimulant. Dishes were placed on ice, and the overlying medium was removed at the end of the reaction. Cells were lysed with RIPA, following one wash with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the HAhIP was immunoprecipitated as outlined above. Following phosphorimaging of dried gels, rectangles of equal size were drawn around each of the bands observed, and the intensity quantified using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Based on the PKC consensus site sequences found in hIP, peptides containing either serine 328 (hIPS328: LASGRRDPRAP) or serine 374 (hIPS372: AVGTSSKAEA) were synthesized. A third peptide, hIPT230 (LGPRPRTGEDEV), which does not contain a consensus site for PKC phosphorylation was also generated. PKC-α-pseudosubstrate peptide was used as a positive control. Using these as substrates, in vitro PKC phosphorylation assays were carried as described (17Vezza R. Habib A. Li H. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30028-30033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were carried out in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing 250 μm bovine serum albumin, 10 μm CaCl2, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine, 1 μl of PKC (rat brain), 100 μm ATP, 7.5 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by spotting half the reaction mixture on 1 inch squares of P81 cation exchange chromatography paper (Whatman, Maidstone, United Kingdom). Following three washes in 0.5% phosphoric acid, the squares were subjected to scintillation counting. Phosphorylation of the peptides was carried out as described above; at the end of the incubation period, samples were put on ice and then frozen at −80 °C until the analysis. The high pressure liquid chromatography pump was a Hewlett Packard series 1050 quaternary pump (Wilmington, DE). The mobile phase consisted of water (solvent A) and acetonitrile:water (90:10, solvent B), both with 0.05% (v:v) trifluoroacetic acid. A LC Packings (San Francisco, CA) 300 μm × 15 cm column with Vydec C18 5 μm 300 Å stationary phase was used to separate samples. The flow rate of the pump was controlled at 0.4 ml/min and split before the injector to 4 μl/min. An aliquot of solution containing 100 pmol of peptide was injected on column, a linear solvent gradient program starting at 5% solvent B and ramping to 40% solvent B in solution was injected on column, and the mobile phase was set at 3% solvent B. The high pressure liquid chromatography was connected online to a mass spectrometer (17Vezza R. Habib A. Li H. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30028-30033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The capillary voltage was set to 3.5 kV, the sampling cone voltage to 40 V, and the source temperature to 65 °C. The mass analyzer was scanned continuously from m/z 300 to 1400 with a scan duration of 3 s. The relative amount of the peptide phosphorylation was calculated from the selected ion chromatography peak area obtained from the high pressure liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry experiments. Western blot analysis (Fig. 2) of membranes prepared from HEK 293 cells transfected with HAhIP or its mutants demonstrated that, similar to the nonmutated receptor (HAhIP), each of the point mutants resolved as a broad band with a molecular mass from 44 to 66 kDa. The mass of C-DEL was shifted to a 38–54-kDa band, indicating the loss of 74 amino acids from the C-terminal tail. Two lower molecular weight species (30 and 27), not seen with any of the other receptors, were evident in membranes prepared from C-DEL-transfected cells. The level of expression of the mature receptor was similar in HAhIP-, S328A-, S374A-, and S328A/S374A- and apparently lower in C-DEL- transfected cells. Immunofluoresence staining of transfected cells showed the expected pattern of membrane localization of all mutant receptors (Fig. 3 A). This was similar to HAhIP-transfected cells for all point mutant receptors (S328A, S374A, and S328A/S374A), whereas somewhat more diffuse staining was apparent in cells transfected with C-DEL. Analysis of HAhIP and C-DEL localization by confocal microscopy confirmed the membrane localization of both receptors, although cytosolic localization of the latter was also apparent (Fig. 3 B). We have previously shown that activation of HAhIP in this system leads to an increase in both intracellular cAMP and inositol phosphates (3Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33698-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 4 A, treatment of transfected cells with increasing concentrations of iloprost caused an increase in cAMP levels. Coupling of HAhIP and mutant receptors to cAMP production was comparable (Fig. 4, B–E). Basal levels (0.7–2.2 pmol cAMP/106 cells) and EC50 values for iloprost (Table I) were comparable between each of the cell lines. Thus, all receptors were functional, and the mutations did not substantially affect receptor coupling to the Gs-cAMP pathway.Table IEC50 values (nm) for iloprost-stimulated cAMP and inositol phosphate production in cells transfected with HAhIP or the mutant receptorscAMP productionInositol phosphate productionHAhIP0.10 ± 0.03 (n = 3)78.4 ± 19.4 (n = 4)S374A0.12 ± 0.07 (n = 3)78.8 ± 10.8 (n = 5)S328A0.22 ± 0.09 (n = 4)142.98 ± 36.8 (n = 4)S328A/S374A0.11 ± 0.04 (n = 3)192.3 ± 11.9 (n = 3)C-DEL0.27 ± 0.14 (n = 3)169.0 ± 35.1 (n = 4)Data are the mean ± S.E. from the indicated number of experiments (n), each performed in duplicate.

Iloprost stimulated inositol phosphate production in HAhIP- and S374A-transfected cells with similar potency and efficacy (Fig. 5, A and B and Table I). However, stimulation of inositol phosphate production reached only 2–3-fold over basal in cells transfected with S328A, S328A/S374A, and C-DEL (Fig. 5, C–E) and EC50 values (Table I) were slightly higher. Similar changes in coupling to inositol phosphate production were seen with a second prostacyclin analog, cicaprost (data not shown). Previously, we reported a rapid iloprost-stimulated phosphorylation of HAhIP (3Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33698-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A similar pattern of rapid phosphorylation was evident only with cells transfected with the S374A mutant (Fig. 6 A). Both HAhIP- and S374A-transfected cells demonstrated a 4–6-fold increase in phosphorylated receptor following treatment with iloprost for increasing time intervals. The minor dip evident in the S374A time course is probably a result of loading errors because this was not a consistent observation. Furthermore, PMA-induced phosphorylation also occurred in these cells (Fig. 6 B), indicating that PKC-mediated phosphorylation occurs despite the substitution of serine 374. In contrast, both S328A- and S328A/S374A-transfected cells showed a marked reduction of iloprost-induced phosphorylation. Although iloprost-induced phosphorylation occurred over the same rapid time course, maximum increases of only 2–3-fold were achieved (Fig. 6 A). PMA-induced S328A and S328A/S374A phosphorylation was completely absent (Fig. 6 B). Cells transfected with C-DEL showed no phosphorylation with either agonist. These data indicate that serine 328 is the locus of iloprost-induced PKC-mediated rapid HAhIP phosphorylation. In vitro phosphorylation of hIP peptides corroborated this finding. Three hIP peptides were used in these experiments: hIPS328 and hIPS374, containing the consensus sites for PKC phosphorylation, and hIPT230, containing a threonine residue that is not in a PKC consensus sequence. hIPS328 was phosphorylated by PKC, but hIPS374 and hIPT230 were not (Fig. 7). A known PKC substrate, α-pseudosubstrate peptide (18Nakadate T. Jeng A.Y. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11507-11513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. Analysis of the peptides by mass spectrometry confirmed these findings (Fig. 8). In the case of the α-pseudosubstrate peptide, roughly 50% of the total peptide was phosphorylated. Less than 1% of the hIPS328 peptide, by contrast, was phosphorylated. However, no phosphorylation of the hIPS374 or hIPT230 peptides was detected.Figure 8High pressure liquid chromatography/electrospray mass spectrometry analysis.Electrospray mass spectra of the doubly charged ion of PKC-α-pseudosubstrate peptide (A), doubly charged ion of hIPS328 (B), singly charged ion of hIPS347 (C), and doubly charged ion of hIPT230 (D) analyzed alone (upper panels) or after preincubation (90 min, 30 °C) with PKC (lower panels). The x axis represents the mass to charge ration (Da/e), and they axis represents the relative intensity for each species. The two molecular species in panel C are the protonated and sodiated molecular species of this peptide. A molecular mass shift of m/z 80 for singly charged ions orm/z 40 for doubly charged ions is the evidence of phosphorylation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Pretreatment with iloprost induced rapid desensitization of receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase in membranes prepared from HAhIP-transfected cells (Fig. 9). Treatment of cells for 10 min with 1 μm iloprost, conditions which maximally phosphorylate the receptor (Fig. 6 and Ref. 3Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33698-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), induced a striking reduction in concentration-dependent iloprost-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activation (Fig. 9 A). This effect was rapid; it was evident after only a 15 s treatment (Fig. 9 B). Substitution of serine 374 with alanine had minimal impact on either desensitization of the concentration-dependent response of membrane adenylyl cyclase to iloprost (Fig. 10 A), or the time course of desensitization to 1 μm iloprost (Fig. 11 A). In contrast, truncation of the C-terminal tail completely prevented iloprost-induced desensitization (Figs. 10 D and 11 D). Substitution of serine 328 with alanine either alone or in combination with serine 374, resulted in a markedly reduced level of desensitization. Although pretreatment with 1 μm iloprost produced some abrogation of iloprost-stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in S328A- and S328A/S374A-transfected cells, this was only evident at lower agonist concentrations (Fig. 10, B and C). In addition, pretreatment of S328A- or S328A/S374A-transfected cells with 1 μm iloprost for increasing times did not produce a significant level of desensitization, in contrast to HAhIP and S374A-transfected cells (Fig. 11, B and C).Figure 10Desensitization of mutant"
https://openalex.org/W1981661508,"Several studies have established that the prolactin (PRL) gene is expressed not only in lactotrophs and somatotrophs of the anterior pituitary but, albeit to a lesser extent, in non-pituitary cells like human thymocytes, decidualized endometrium, mammary glands during lactation, and some human non-pituitary cell lines. Despite the requirement in the pituitary for the pituitary-specific transcription factor Pit-1/GHF-1 for PRL expression, the expression in non-pituitary cells occurs in the absence of Pit-1/GHF-1 and can be repressed by glucocorticoids. This prompted us to investigate the transcription factors in non-pituitary cells which are involved in controlling expression and glucocorticoid repression of a previously characterized negative glucocorticoid response element from the bovine prolactin gene (PRL3 nGRE). Here we have demonstrated that non-pituitary cells (COS-7 and mouse hepatoma Hepa1c1c7 cells) conferred increased expression via the PRL3 nGRE mainly because of the binding of the ubiquitously expressed POU-homeodomain-containing octamer transcription factor-1 (Oct-1) to an AT-rich sequence present in the PRL3 sequence. However, full transcriptional activity required the binding of a second ubiquitously expressed homeodomain-containing protein, Pbx, previously shown to bind cooperatively with several homeotic selector proteins. The Pbx binding site in the PRL3 nGRE, located just upstream of the Oct-1 binding site, showed a strong sequence similarity with known Pbx binding sites and bound Pbx with an affinity similar to that of other established Pbx target sequences. Interestingly, both Oct-1 and Pbx binding to the PRL3 nGRE were found to be required for glucocorticoid repression. Addition of in vitro translated glucocorticoid receptor DNA binding domain to the nuclear extract prevented Oct-1 and Pbx from binding to the PRL element. The involvement of the homeobox protein Pbx in glucocorticoid repression via an nGRE identifies a new role for this protein."

Although the exact mechanism by which HTLV-I contributes to leukemogenesis is still unclear, the Tax protein is thought to play a major role in this process. This 40-kDa polypeptide is able to interact with the tumor suppressor p16INK4A. Consequently, Tax can activate the signaling pathway that lead to the release of E2F that in turn induces expression of factors required for cell cycle progression. In this paper, we demonstrate that Tax can also activate E2F-mediated transcription independently of p16INK4A. Indeed, when Tax is coexpressed with the E2F-1 transcription factor in CEM T-cells, which lack expression of p16INK4A, it strongly potentiates the E2F-dependent activation of a reporter construct driven by a promoter containing E2F binding sites. This stimulation is abrogated by mutations affecting the E2F-binding sites. In addition, Tax also stimulates the transcription of the E2F-1 gene itself. Using Tax mutants that fail to activate either ATF- or NF-κB-dependent promoters and different 5′ truncation mutants of the E2F-1 promoter, we show that the Tax-dependent transcriptional control of the E2F1 gene involves, at least in part, the ATF binding site located in the E2F-1 promoter.

It has been suggested that Tax plays a key role in the onset of ATL, but it still remains unclear which of the diverse stimulation activities of Tax is essential for immortalization of HTLV-I-infected T-lymphocytes. In studies with Tax mutants (18Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), transactivation through NF-κB was reported to be not required for rat fibroblast transformation, whereas Tax mutants unable to transactivate the ATF/CREB pathway were described to be not oncogenic (19Smith M.R. Greene W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, these results are in contrast to an observation of Yamaoka et al. (20Yamaoka S. Inoue H. Sakurai M. Sugiyama T. Hazama M. Yamada T. Hatanaka M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 873-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), suggesting that constitutive activation of NF-κB is essential for transformation of rat fibroblasts by Tax. Nevertheless, transduction in human primary T-lymphocytes of a Tax mutant that is active for ATF/CREB but inactive for NF-κB resulted in permanent growth of the cells suggesting that Tax can induce immortalization of T-lymphocytes through a mechanism independent of NF-κB pathway (21Rosin O.

All E2Fs share a conserved DNA-binding domain, and an acidic residue-rich region involved in transcription activation. While bound on DNA, they exist as free heterodimers E2F/DP or associated in larger complexes containing members of the pRB tumor suppressor (pRB, p107, p130) and of the cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinases (cycE/cdk2, cycA/cdk2) protein families. E2F/DP transcription factors can act as repressors (large complexes) or as activators (free heterodimers) of their target genes. The pocket proteins pRB, p107, and p130 inhibit E2F/DP transactivation and probably that of other surrounding transcription factors close to E2Fs on DNA. E2F/DP association with the pocket proteins is controlled, at least in part, by the cyclin/cdks (cycD/cdk4, cycE/cdk2, cycA/cdk2)-dependent phosphorylation of the pocket proteins and of E2F/DP. This control of cdks on E2F activity links the cell-cycle machinery to gene-regulated expression. All E2F/DP family members recognize a canonical sequence, 5′-T(N)T(C/G)(C/G)CGC-3′ (29Wade M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9783-9791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that is critical in the promoter of many genes controlling cell cycle progression, such as: (i) DNA and chromatin synthesis proteins: dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), thymidine kinase, DNA polymerase α, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, histone H2A; (ii) cell cycle regulatory proteins: cyclin A, cyclin E, cyclin D1, p107, pRB, cdc6, hsorc1, E2F-1, and E2F-2; (iii) cellular proto-oncogenes: including c-myc, N-myc, erb-B and B-myb. A detailed study of E2F protein complexes in T-cells demonstrated that the prevailing E2F complexes contain E2F-1 and E2F-4 associated with DP-1 (30Moberg K. Starz M.A. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1436-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Given the crucial role of E2F target genes in cell proliferation, the stimulation of the E2F activity by HTLV-I could be involved in the proliferation and transformation of T-cells in ATL. Several lines of evidence support this model. Indeed, it has been shown that HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and leukemic cells obtained from ATL patients contained high levels of the DNA binding activity of E2F and that Tax enhanced this E2F activity in Jurkat T-cells (31Mori K. Eur. J. Haematol. 1997; 58: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). As proposed recently (32Yoshida M. J. AIDS Hum. Retrovirol. 1996; 13: S63-S68PubMed Google Scholar), it is believed that Tax mediates this effect via its direct interaction with the cdk inhibitor p16INK4A (33Suzuki T. Kitao S. Matsushime H.

Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar): (i) an increase in cyclin D/cdk4 kinase activity in infected cells, (ii) an enhanced level of phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein family (pRB, p107, and p130), and (iii) an increase in E2F transcriptional activity. However, we demonstrate that Tax also stimulates the E2F activity via other mechanisms. Indeed, using transient transfection analysis, we demonstrate here that Tax remains able to stimulate gene expression through E2F-1 and E2F-4 in the p16INK4A-negative CEM T-cell line. Furthermore, we show that the stimulation by Tax of a luciferase reporter gene driven by E2F motifs is abrogated by mutations that affect the E2F binding sites. Finally, we demonstrate that Tax regulates E2F-1 gene expression at the level of transcription and that this transcriptional control depends, at least in part, on the ATF binding site of the E2F-1 gene promoter. Together, these results indicate that Tax can likely disregulate the machinery controlling cell cycle progression not only by activating E2F-dependent transcription but also by stimulating the transcription of the E2F-1 gene itself. Since overexpression of E2F-1 in mammalian cells can cause oncogenesis (36Johnson D.G. Cress W.D. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The lymphoblastoid CEM cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Bethesda, MD). The HTLV-I-infected MT4 and C8166 cell lines have been described elsewhere (39Miyoshi I.

JPX-9 is a clone of Jurkat cells stably transfected by a Tax expression vector in which Tax expression is dependent on heavy metal ions (42Nagata K. Ohtani M. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3220-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). JPX/M cells correspond to cells transfected by a mutant plasmid in which a frameshift mutation is introduced in the coding region of the Tax gene (42Nagata K. Ohtani M. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3220-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); in CdCl2- or ZnCl2-treated JPX/M cells, the mutant Tax gene is induced at the mRNA level but no functional Tax protein is produced (42Nagata K. Ohtani M. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3220-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic mixture, 1% Glutamax (Life Technologies, Eragny, France) and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies), to a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.

Kaelin W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6607-6615Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Detection of retrotranscribed RNAs was performed according to a previously published procedure (17Lemasson I. Robert-Hebmann V. Hamaia S. Duc Dodon M. Gazzolo L. Devaux C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular oligonucleotide primers used in this study are as follows: E2F-1 I (5′-CAGATCTCCCTTAAGAGC-3′, nucleotides 1041–1058), E2F-1 II (5′-CAGTCGAAGAGGTCTCTG-3′, nucleotides 1582–1599, antisense mRNA), GAPDH I (5′-TGAGAAGTATGACAACAGC-3′, nucleotides 3806–3824), and GAPDH II (5′-TCCACCACTGACACGTTG-3′, nucleotides 4394–4411, antisense mRNA). The oligonucleotide primer pair Tax2/TRU2 (17Lemasson I. Robert-Hebmann V. Hamaia S. Duc Dodon M. Gazzolo L. Devaux C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to detect retrotranscribed Tax mRNA. CEM cells were transiently cotransfected according to the previously published procedure (49Lemasson I. Briant L. Hague B. Coudronnière N. Heron L. David C. Rebouissou C. Kindt T. Devaux C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 859-865PubMed Google Scholar). 5 μg of a β-galactosidase-containing plasmid (pACβ1) was included in each transfection for controlling of the transfection efficiency. The total amount of DNA in each series of transfection was equal, the balance being made up with empty pSG-5 vector without Tax. Cell extracts equalized for protein content were used for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (49Lemasson I. Briant L. Hague B. Coudronnière N. Heron L. David C. Rebouissou C. Kindt T. Devaux C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 859-865PubMed Google Scholar). 20 μg of protein from nuclear extracts were electrophoresed onto 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The blot was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a blocking solution (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10% milk and 0.05% Tween 20) prior to addition of antiserum. After 1 h at 20 °C, the blot was washed three times with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 30 min with goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin-peroxydase conjugate (Immunotech, Marseille, France). After three washes, the membrane was incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was then exposed for 0.5 to 5 min to Hyperfilms-ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-E2F-1 mAb and anti-actin mAb C4 were purchased, respectively, from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA); anti-Tax was obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH. HTLV-I Tax hybridoma 168A51–42 (Tab176) was from Dr. B. Langton (50Langton B.C. Sliwkoski M. Tran K.V. Knapp S. Keitelman E. Smith C. Wallingford S. Liu H.-L. Ralston J.S. Brandis J. Coates S. Med. Virol. 1988; 8: 295-301Google Scholar). To test whether Tax might activate E2F-mediated transcription independently of p16INK4A pathway, we performed transient cotransfection assays in a T-cell line defective in expression of p16INK4A. It has been described that some tumor cell lines are unable to express the p16INK4A and among them various transformed T-cell lines having homozygous deletions of the p16INK4A gene (33Suzuki T. Kitao S. Matsushime H. Yoshida M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations, no p16INK4A could be detected in the CEM cell line used in our study (data not shown). At first, we tested the effects of Tax on the promoters of the DHFR and cyclin E genes, which are known to be controlled by the E2F factors (29Wade M. Blake M.C. Jambou R.C. Helin K. Harlow E. Azizkhan J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9783-9791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 45Geng Y. Eaton E.N. Picon M. Roberts J.M. Lundberg A.S. Gifford A. Sardet C. Weinberg R.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1173-1180PubMed Google Scholar). Transient cotransfection assays were carried out using luciferase expression plasmids. The transfection assays were performed in CEM cells in the presence or absence of the Tax expression vector pSG-Tax. Tax synthesis stimulated expression of luciferase gene driven by cyclin E (pCycE-luc) and DHFR (pDHFR-luc) promoters with a 4- and 3.5-fold increase in luciferase activity, respectively (Fig. 1). When the transfection assays were carried out with transcriptionally defective Tax mutants, Tax M9 (Fig. 1) and Tax M21 (data not shown), such stimulations were not detected. These results indicated that Tax was able to activate the promoters of DHFR and cyclin E genes in a p16INK4A-negative T-cell line. To study possible involvement of E2F in Tax transactivation of these cellular promoters, we first tested whether Tax might cooperate with E2F in transactivation. E2F1 and Tax were coexpressed in presence of a reporter construct driven by a minimal promoter with upstream E2F-binding sites (p3xE2F-WT-luc). This construct contains three E2F binding sites cloned immediately upstream of a TATA box controlling the transcription of the luciferase gene. Fig. 2 shows that this reporter was stimulated 8.5-fold in the presence of the expression vector pCMV-E2F-1 alone and 9-fold with pSG-Tax alone. No stimulation was detected with the mutants Tax M9 (Fig. 2) and Tax M21 (data not shown). This Tax stimulation was likely mediated by endogenous E2F factor. Cotransfection of pSG-Tax and pCMV-E2F-1 induced a 44-fold increase in luciferase activity, indicating that Tax was able to stimulate E2F-1 activity in the CEM cell line. Cotransfections with the transcriptionally defective Tax mutants produced no stimulation of E2F-1 activity. To assess whether transactivation by Tax may be ascribed to a direct effect of the binding of E2F-1 to the tested minimal promoter, Tax stimulation of the luciferase gene driven by three mutated E2F binding sites were analyzed with the plasmid p3xE2F-MUT-luc. The design of this mutant, which converts the E2F binding site 5′-TTTCGCGC-3′ to 5′-TTgCtCGa-3′, was based on mutations that are known to abolish binding and activity of E2F (44Krek W. Livingston D.M. Shirodkar S. Science. 1993; 262: 1557-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the mutant promoter was very poorly induced by Tax and E2F-1 compared with the wild type construct. The efficiency of Tax-mediated induction of luciferase activity was reduced by 5.5-fold with Tax alone and 39-fold with Tax and E2F-1 compared with control promoter. The mutant promoter still showed a slight 1.5-fold enhancement by Tax, which corroborates previous published results (see,e.g., Refs. 51Miyatake S. Seiki M. Yoshida M. Arai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5581-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 52Paul N.L. Lenardo M.J. Novak K.D. Sarr T. Tang W. Ruddle N.H. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16288-16291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and represents low level of Tax induction on a minimal TATA box. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Tax activates E2F-1-dependent transcription. The E2F family is composed of two subclasses of evolutionarily distinct factors: E2Fs-1, 2 and 3, which interact with pRB; and E2F-4 and E2F-5, which interact with p107 and p130, two other members of the pRB family. Amino acid sequence comparison revealed that E2F-4 and E2F-5 were more closely related to each other than to E2Fs 1, 2 ,and 3. We questioned whether transactivation by Tax of a promoter containing E2F binding sites could be activated in the presence of E2F-4. For this experiment, we used the same approach as described for E2F-1, by testing the Tax transactivation on wild type and mutated E2F sites in cotransfection experiments with or without E2F-4. Although expression of E2F-4 in cells transfected with the vector pCSMYC-E2F-4 induced a 6-fold stimulation of the reporter gene, its coexpression with pSG-Tax gave rise to a 21-fold increase in luciferase activity (data not shown). Likewise, as showed for E2F-1, mutation of the E2F site reduced the Tax activity on E2F-4, confirming that stimulation by Tax was due to direct effect of the binding of E2F-4 to the E2F site (data not shown). Thus, not only does Tax activate E2F-1-dependent transcription, it is also able to stimulate the E2F-4 transcriptional activity. As it has been proposed that the E2F1 gene might be regulated by its own product, we tested whether Tax would also stimulate the E2F1 promoter, thereby enhancing its effect on cellular E2F activity. To address this question, we first checked the level of endogenous E2F-1 protein in two human T-cell lines infected with HTLV-I, MT4, and C8166 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, immunoblotting analysis using an anti-E2F-1 mAb indicated that expression of E2F-1 was increased in nuclear extracts of Tax-positive cells compared with the level seen in uninfected Jurkat and HSB-2 cells. This result suggests that Tax expression could stimulate E2F-1 gene expression. In order to test whether this effect was due to a direct transcriptional effect of Tax on E2F-1 gene expression, we then compared E2F-1 mRNA levels in presence or absence of Tax protein. This experiment was carried out with the JPX-9 clone of Jurkat cells containing the Tax gene under a promoter whose expression is stimulated by heavy metal ions (42Nagata K. Ohtani M. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3220-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 A, the level of E2F-1 mRNA was clearly increased in JPX-9 cells treated with either ZnCl2 or CdCl2, whereas the expression of control GAPDH mRNA was unchanged. JPX/M cells that expressed nonfunctional Tax were treated in the same way but did not show any increase in the level of E2F-1 mRNA (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that stimulation of E2F-1 mRNA synthesis correlates with the presence of Tax. We finally tested whether Tax can stimulate E2F-1 promoter activity. Transfection assays were performed with the plasmid pGL2-AN that contains the E2F-1 promoter cloned upstream of the luciferase gene. Cotransfection of pSG-Tax and pGL2-AN induced a 5.5-fold stimulation in luciferase activity (Fig. 6), indicating that Tax is effectively able to activate the E2F-1 promoter. To further explore the mechanisms underlying this transcriptional activation the same cotransfection assay was carried out in presence of Tax mutants that fail to activate ATF (M47)- or NF-κB (M22)-dependent promoters (18Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Tax M22 activated the promoter to levels similar to wild type Tax whereas Tax M47 was able to stimulate only about 2-fold (Fig. 6). From these results, we conclude that Tax transactivation of the E2F-1 promoter is independent on NF-κB but involves the ATF pathway. To further map the regulatory elements of the E2F1 promoter required for activation by Tax, a series of 5′ truncation mutants of pGL2-AN (48Neuman E. Flemington E.K. Sellers W.R. Kaelin W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6607-6615Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) were cotransfected with pSG-Tax (Fig. 7). The deletion that encompasses the 5′ region of the promoter, from position −211 to −131, increased the stimulation by Tax (from 6-fold for the wild type to 10-fold for the deleted promoter), suggesting that Sp1 binding sites could have an inhibitory effect on the E2F-1 promoter activation by Tax. Although the deletion of the CCAAT box had no effect, the deletion of ATF binding motif significantly reduced the activation by Tax (from 10-fold to 5.5-fold). Finally, the deleted pGL2-AN vector containing the E2F binding sites was still stimulated by Tax, confirming the results already described in this paper with the plasmid p3xE2F-WT-luc that contained three copies of the E2F binding site. Taken together, these results confirm the involvement of an ATF-dependent pathway, at least in part, in the transcriptional control of E2F-1 gene by Tax. In this paper, we show that Tax is able to activate E2F-1-dependent transcription in CEM cells (Figs. 2 and 3) and to stimulate E2F-1 gene transcription through the ATF-responsive element localized in the promoter (Figs. 6 and 7). Stimulation of the E2F-1 gene by Tax could explain how Tax transactivates E2F-1-dependent transcription. To determine effects of this stimulation in our tests, transfection assays already described in Fig. 2 were performed again, but in these assays cells were cotransfected with the plasmid p3xE2F-WT-luc containing E2F-binding sites, the E2F-1 expression vector pCMV-E2F-1, together with the mutant Tax M47. As shown in Fig. 8, the wild type Tax and the mutant Tax M22 induced about a 40-fold increase in luciferase activity, whereas Tax M47 stimulated luciferase activity by 14-fold. Since Tax M47 fails to activate ATF-dependent promoters, this stimulation cannot be explained by the effect of Tax on the stimulation of the E2F-1 gene through the ATF pathway. This result confirms the importance of the ATF pathway but also indicates that other activation mechanisms could contribute to E2F-1 stimulation by Tax. The regulation of E2F is a key target for oncoviruses. Binding of pRB and the other pocket proteins to ligands such as, adenovirus E1A, simian virus large T antigen, and papillomavirus E7, leads to a"

Small, trans-acting ribozymes including the hairpin ribozyme and the hammerhead ribozyme function as sequence-selective ribonucleases. Because their sequence specificity can be manipulated in the laboratory, ribozymes hold considerable promise as tools for targeted RNA inactivation within cells and organisms. Numerous potential applications for ribozymes are being actively explored, including the analysis of gene function, and the development of therapeutics for genetic and viral diseases. The hairpin ribozyme is derived from the minus strand of the satellite RNA of tobacco ringspot virus (1Prody G.A. Bakos J.T. Buzayan J.M. Schneider I.R. Bruening G. Science. 1986; 321: 1577-1580Crossref Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 2Van Tol H. Buzayan J.M. Bruening G.

The ribozyme folds into two domains, termed A and B, which must interact for cleavage to occur (Fig. 1). Substrate recognition is accomplished through the formation of two short helical elements that flank a symmetrical internal loop (loop A; Fig. 1). Domain B also contains two helices and an internal loop. Most of the nucleotides in loop A and loop B are essential for catalytic activity, while base pair substitutions within helix 1 and helix 2, necessary for changes in target specificity, are tolerated (5Berzal-Herranz A.

Biol. 1997; 74: 161-169PubMed Google Scholar), the optimal sequence for ribozyme cleavage can be defined as 5′-RYN↓GUC-3′ (where R represents A or G and Y represents C or U) from −3 to +3 relative to the cleavage site (indicated by a downward arrow). Other substrates may be cleaved but with lower activity. A guanosine residue is required at position +1, immediately to the 3′-side of the cleavage site (11Chowrira B.M. Berzal-Herranz A. Burke J.M. Nature. 1991; 354: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this work, we employ a modified form of the hairpin ribozyme with a U39C substitution (5Berzal-Herranz A. Joseph S. Burke J.M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 12Joseph S. Burke J.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7739-7748Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Each of these modifications has been shown to increase the activity of hairpin ribozymes. Because substrate binding is achieved predominantly by Watson-Crick base pairing, the sequence specificity of both the hairpin and the hammerhead ribozymes can be manipulated by changing the nucleotide sequences of their substrate binding domains. Since the consensus sequence is not very restrictive, virtually any mRNA or viral genomic RNA of interest is likely to possess numerous potential target sites for ribozyme cleavage. To date, most investigators have selected target sites through a computer-aided process that searches for sites with similarity to the consensus sequence, as derived from in vitro studies with model oligoribonucleotide substrates (10Yu Q. Burke J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 74: 161-169PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, it is frequently observed that only a small fraction of engineered ribozymes gives rise to significant reductions in target RNA levels within cells (14Burke J.M. Nature Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 414-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Usman N. Stinchcomb D.T. Nucleic Acids Mol. Biol. 1996; 10: 243-264Crossref Google Scholar). There are many factors that could result in ineffective or inefficient cleavage of targeted RNAs in the cellular environment. These factors include inappropriate localization of ribozymes within the cell, low catalytic activity in the cellular environment, inadequate expression of ribozyme transgenes, degradation of ribozymes within the cell, and cleavage of untargeted cellular RNAs. Folding of both the ribozyme and the targeted RNA is a significant issue that raises two major concerns. First, potential target sites may be occluded by the folded structure of the target RNA (16Goodchild J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4607-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Viral RNAs, in particular, have been shown to form extensive, stable secondary structures (17Felden B. Florentz C. Giege R. Westhof E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 2: 508-531Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Berkhout B. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, unpublished studies show that changes in the substrate specificity of both hairpin and hammerhead ribozymes can result in loss of catalytic activity as a result of ribozyme misfolding. Computer-aided prediction of RNA secondary structure is of some utility in the identification of the most inaccessible cleavage sites and for avoiding the most obviously misfolded ribozymes. The rationale behind this study described in this work is as follows. Our working hypothesis is that the two most important factors in the identification of ribozymes that can effectively recognize and cleave a targeted mRNA are, first, target site accessibility and, second, the ability to form an active ribozyme-substrate complex. It is clear that these two factors are mutually interdependent and that the relationship between them is complex and, at this stage of ribozyme research, impossible to predict. Such an unpredictable interdependence can best be approached by using combinatorial methods. We have previously developed an in vitro selection system for the hairpin ribozyme that utilizes sequential cleavage and ligation reactions catalyzed by self-cleaving constructs that incorporate both ribozyme and substrate into the same RNA. However, this method cannot be directly adapted to the current problem, which requirestrans-cleavage of the targeted RNA. Therefore, we have chosen to use combinatorial libraries of hairpin ribozymes encompassing all possible sequence specificities to identify the most readily cleaved sites within targeted RNA molecules in vitro. In this paper, we describe the development of this strategy, using Sindbis virus 26 S subgenomic RNA (4.2 kb)1 as a model system. A member of the alphavirus family, Sindbis virus has a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity and replicates in the cytoplasm. The genomic RNA is 11.7 kb (49 S) in length (19Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Strauss E.G. Rice C.M. Strauss J.H. Virology. 1984; 133: 92-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), but the viral structural proteins are expressed from a shorter 26 S subgenomic RNA produced during the infectious cycle. The 26 S subgenomic RNA of Sindbis virus strain SAAR86 was chosen as a model target RNA for our screening experiments, in part because it is predicted to be highly structured and, therefore, a very challenging target for ribozyme-mediated RNA inactivation. Our results show that the most effectively cleaved sites deviate substantially from the established consensus and support a model in which target site accessibility is the most critical factor for RNA inactivation. The pool of ribozymes, containing 10 randomized positions in the substrate binding domain (Fig. 1), was transcribed from a synthetic DNA template pool using bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, as described (21Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 22Chowrira B.M. Burke J.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8518-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The sequence of the DNA template pool is 5′-TACCAGGTAATGTACCACGACTTACGTCGTGTGTTTCTCTGGTNNRCTTCNNNNNNNCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′, where N is any base, R represents A or G, and the underlined sequence represents the bottom strand of the T7 promoter. These DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized using standard solid-phase phosphoramidite chemistry on an Applied Biosystems model 392 oligonucleotide synthesizer. The randomized sites were generated by mixing four different nucleoside phosphoramidites (A, C, G, T) at concentrations that result in equal molar coupling during synthesis. RNA transcripts were produced by transcription of the DNA templates with T7 RNA polymerase and purified as described (23Butcher S.E. Burke J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 922-999Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Four DNA fragments, each approximately 1.1 kb in length, were amplified from a full-length cDNA plasmid of the Sindbis SAAR86 strain (Ref. 24Simpson D.A. Davis N.L. Lin S.C. Russell D. Johnston R.E. Virology. 1996; 2: 464-469Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar; GenBankTM accession code U38305), using PCR primers containing a T7 promoter (Fig. 2 A). There are 46–95-nt sequence overlaps between adjacent PCR products. Each of the four long RNA substrates was produced by transcription of the PCR product using T7 RNA polymerase and was purified by electrophoresis through a 4% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The nucleotide positions of the primers are as follows: PA0 (7482–7502), PA5 (8531–8548); PB0 (8503–8522), PB5 (9590–9609); PC0 (9514–9533), PC5 (10629–10649); PD0 (10576–10594), PD5 (11638–11663); numbers designate the positions in the Sindbis cDNA sequence. The 1.1-kb RNA segments and the randomized pool of ribozymes were preincubated separately at 37 °C for 10 min in the reaction buffer (25Esteban J.E. Banerjee A.R. Burke J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13629-13639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or in a control buffer (see below). Each of the long RNA substrates (0.1 μm) was then incubated in the presence or absence of a 20 μm concentration of the randomized ribozyme pool in a buffer that supports catalytic activity (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 12 mm MgCl2) or in a control buffer in which ribozymes are inactive (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA). This pool contains each specific ribozyme molecule at a concentration of 0.04 nm (see below). Cleavage reactions were carried out for 2 h at 37 °C in a final volume of 5 μl and then were desalted by passing through a CentriSep column (Princeton Separations) and dried in preparation for primer extension reactions. Cleavage sites were identified by primer extension alongside sequencing ladders generated with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and 5′-end-labeled DNA primers as described (8Butcher S.E. Burke J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 52-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Since each primer generates a readable sequence of 200–250 nt, five different primers were needed to accurately map all of the cleavage sites within each of the four overlapping 1.1-kb RNA substrates. A total of 20 primers (PA1–PA5, PB1–PB5, PC1–PC5, and PD1–PD5) were used. The nucleotide positions of primers within the cDNA sequence are as follows: PA1 (7672–7688), PA2 (7852–7972), PA3 (8106–8124), PA4 (8358–8378), PA5 (8531–8548); PB1 (8734–8752), PB2 (8963–8982), PB3 (9184–9202), PB4 (9405–9424), PB5 (9590–9609); PC1 (9719–9738), PC2 (9941–9960), PC3 (10163–10183), PC4 (10394–10411), PC5 (10629–10649); PD1 (10770–10787), PD2 (10975–10994), PD3 (11210–11229), PD4 (11433–11449), PD5 (11638–11663). Ribozymes directed against specific targets in Sindbis 26 S RNA were produced by in vitro transcription of oligonucleotide templates with T7 RNA polymerase and purified as described above. The 14-nt oligoribonucleotide substrates were synthesized using RNA phosphoramidite chemistry on an Applied Biosystems 392 oligonucleotide synthesizer, deprotected as described (26Scaringe S.A. Francklyn C. Usman N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 27Sproat B. Colonna F. Mullah B. Tsou D. Andrus A. Hampel A. Vinayak R. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1995; 14: 255-273Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and purified by 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by high pressure liquid chromatography on a reverse-phase C8 column. Activity tests against synthetic 14-nt substrate RNAs were carried out under single-turnover conditions (25Esteban J.E. Banerjee A.R. Burke J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13629-13639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) with 200 nm ribozyme, 1 nm 5′-32P-labeled substrate RNA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 12 mmMgCl2. Reactions were followed over a time course of 30 min at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed at specific times, subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and quantified using a Bio-Rad GS525 molecular imaging instrument. Individual ribozymes were tested for activity against 1.1-kb fragments of Sindbis virus 26 S subgenomic RNA. These long substrate RNAs were produced by T7 transcription of PCR products as described above, except that a trace quantity of [α-32P]CTP was added to the transcription mix. The labeled transcripts were purified by gel electrophoresis and used in trace amounts as substrates by incubating with an excess of ribozyme (200 nm) at 37 °C, in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 12 mm MgCl2for 2 h. Reactions were followed as above by removal of timed aliquots for gel electrophoresis and quantitation. The selection procedure was conducted in much the same manner as described (12Joseph S. Burke J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24515-24518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 119-nt DNA oligonucleotide was synthesized that contained a T7 promoter, a primer binding site, and a ribozyme coding region with 10 positions randomized in the substrate binding domain (Fig. 1), followed by a linker and the 14-nt 8242 target sequence (5′-TGTCTCCTCTGCCTGGTTCGAAGGACCAGGTAATGTACGATCTCCGAAGAGATCTGTTTCTCTGGTNNRCTTCNBNNNNNGGTACCGTGATCCCATGTTTCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′, where B = G, C, or T). After transcription and electrophoresis in a 6% denaturing gel, the self-cleaved ribozyme band was excised and eluted from the gel. A ligation substrate (ligator, 5′-GAGGAGACAAGAUAUCCGUCGACAAG-3′), which contained a 3′-cleavage product of the 8242 substrate followed by a reverse transcription-PCR annealing site was prepared by cleaving with Rz8242U. The ligator was incubated in excess with the self-cleaved ribozyme pool under standard conditions and then desalted and subjected to reverse transcription-PCR using Thermus thermophilus DNA polymerase. After three cycles of selection, the population was sampled by cloning and sequencing. For each of the 30 clones, transcriptional templates were prepared by PCR and transcribed into ribozymes. The initial cleavage rates of each ribozyme against 8242 substrate were tested under single turnover conditions as described above. Ribozyme libraries were generated byin vitro transcription of synthetic DNA templates. Ten positions were randomized within the substrate binding domain, while the bases whose identity are important for catalytic activity (G8, A9, A10, and G11) remained fixed (Fig. 1). All transcripts contain three guanosine residues at the 5′-end to ensure equal transcriptional efficiency for all variants. The resulting pool of ribozymes is expected to contain 5 × 105 different variants. For the cleavage assays, the quantity of ribozymes used (100 pmol; 6 × 1013 molecules) greatly exceeded the sequence complexity of the pool. Therefore, we believe that all potential sequences within the randomized pool are represented in the experiments, and this is supported by the results of experiments described below. To facilitate the screening of the 4.2-kb 26 S Sindbis virus subgenomic RNA, we divided the 4.2-kb RNA into four segments (RNA fragments A through D); each is ∼1.1 kb with overlaps of 46–95 nt. These long RNA fragments were produced transcriptionally from PCR products with T7 RNA polymerase as described under “Experimental Procedures” and summarized in Fig. 2 A. Each of the long RNA fragments (0.1 μm) was incubated with the randomized pool of ribozymes (20 μm total RNA concentration) either in the presence or in the absence of Mg2+ at 37 °C for 2 h. Although the total concentration of the ribozyme pool is high (20 μm), the concentration of each individual ribozyme species is only 0.04 nm, taking into account the population complexity. Therefore, the substrate is in 2500-fold molar excess over each ribozyme variant. Primer extension analysis demonstrated that most substrate molecules remained uncleaved at the end of the cleavage reaction. Therefore, the great majority of cleavage products resulted from a single cleavage event within the 1.1-kb substrates. Primer extension assays were carried out to identify sites cleaved by the ribozyme library (Fig. 2 B). Although cleavage products are detected as reverse transcriptase stops, the folded structure of the RNA template and other factors are also expected to cause strong stops of reverse transcriptase. Termination sites were identified by alignment with a dideoxy sequencing ladder. To identify the cause of the termination events, controls were carried out in which the ribozyme pool or magnesium ions were omitted. Ribozyme cleavage sites were identified as reverse transcriptase stop sites that occurred only in the presence of both the ribozyme pool and magnesium ions and had a guanosine residue immediately to the 3′-side of the cleavage site (11Chowrira B.M. Berzal-Herranz A. Burke J.M. Nature. 1991; 354: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Each primer was used to scan 200–250 nt of the 26 S subgenomic RNA. In total, 20 primers were used to identify efficient cleavage sites in the four 1.1-kb RNA segments. An example using RNA fragment D and one of its primers (PD3) is shown in Fig. 3. A distinct pattern of primer extension products was observed. Two prominent ribozyme cleavage sites were identified in this example. The number of each cleavage site is defined as the position of the G to the 3′-side of the cleavage site in the full Sindbis genomic RNA sequence. Using this method, we identified the 15 sites that were cleaved with the highest efficiency within the 26 S subgenomic RNA. In a separate search, a traditional computer-aided process was used to search for sequences that show perfect matches with the consensus sequence for the optimal substrate of the hairpin ribozyme (RYN↓GUC), which had previously been defined through the use of mutational studies and in vitro selection methods with hairpin ribozymes and oligoribonucleotide substrates (7Joseph S. Berzal-Herranz A. Chowrira B.M. Butcher S.E. Burke J.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Yu Q. Burke J.M. Methods Mol.

Here, the sites identified through cleavage by the randomized ribozyme libraries are termed “activity-selected” sites, while those identified on the basis of their match with the consensus sequence are termed “sequence-selected” sites.

Open table in a new tab The target sites are defined by the nucleotide position of the guanosine residue immediately 3′ to the scissile bond in the full Sindbis virus genomic RNA sequence. The cleavage efficiencies were determined from the intensities of primer extension bands corresponding to the cleavage products from the randomized pool of ribozymes. The most striking result of the search for cleavage sites is that there is essentially no overlap between the sites that are cleaved by the library and those that are predicted on the basis of sequence. The 26 S viral RNA has 24 exact matches with the substrate consensus sequence. However, little or no cleavage was observed at 23 of these 24 sequence-selected sites. Position 10,122 is the only site where the activity-selected and sequence-selected sites coincide. These results imply that, for the Sindbis virus 26 S RNA, designing ribozymes based on matches to the consensus sequence may be an ineffective strategy. To confirm that our ribozyme pool had detected all available cleavage sites, we generated a second, independent, pool of randomized ribozymes from newly synthesized DNA templates. This pool was used to repeat the screening procedure, using the same transcription, cleavage, and primer extension protocol. The second library of randomized ribozymes yielded gel patterns of cleavage sites that were identical to those obtained with the initial pool of ribozymes (data not shown). Therefore, we believe that the location of the observed cleavage sites and the efficiency with which they are cleaved indicate that each library contains a complete repertoire of ribozyme specificities and that our findings are unlikely to result from a biased pool specificity. An analogous screening procedure was attempted using a population of hammerhead ribozymes with randomized substrate binding arms, each 6 nucleotides in length. No cleavage sites were detected for the hammerhead ribozyme pool (data not shown). The reason for lack of cleavage activity in the hammerhead pool is not known. We designed and synthesized single-sequence ribozymes for cleavage of the targeted sites within the viral 26 S subgenomic RNA. The activity selection protocol serves to identify the sites that are most effectively cleaved, but the identity of the ribozyme(s) that cleave those sites must be inferred from the surrounding sequence. Established rules for ribozyme design were used in this experiment (10Yu Q. Burke J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 74: 161-169PubMed Google Scholar). In most cases, ribozymes could be designed by simply introducing sequences with Watson-Crick complementarity to the substrate in helices 1 and 2, except for ribozyme position G11, which must remain fixed (12Joseph S. Burke J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24515-24518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this could not be done for the substrate base +3 located opposite position 7 of the ribozyme, which was randomized in the ribozyme pool. The nucleotide at this position shows covariance with substrate base +3 (29Rubino L. Tousignant M.E. Steger G. Kaper J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 1897-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 2B. Sargueil and J. Burke, unpublished data. From the phylogenetic data (29Rubino L. Tousignant M.E. Steger G. Kaper J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 1897-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), if the +3 position in the substrate is a C nucleotide, then position 7 in the ribozyme is an A, and vice versa. Eight of the 15 activity-selected sites (8581, 8658, 9333, 9413, 9516, 9861, 10122, and 11160) have either an A or a C at position +3, but five of the sites (8242, 8663, 9841, 9926, 10,603) have a G, and two (10,115 and 11,178) have a U at this position (Table I). Since it had been shown for the normal hairpin ribozyme that a Watson-Crick base pair between position 7 in the ribozyme and position +3 in the substrate is detrimental for catalysis,2 we designed three different ribozymes for the 8242 target (which has a G at position +3). These ribozymes have an A, G, or U at position 7 (ribozymes 8242A, 8242G, and 8242U, respectively). Recent data from our laboratory indicate that if the base at substrate position −5 is a G, then a U instead of a C at position 14 in the ribozyme generally increases cleavage rates in single turnover reactions. This is consistent with the concept that a G·U wobble pair at the last position of helix 2 may provide more flexibility at t"

Intracellular targeting of PKAII isoforms has been linked to cAMP-dependent gene transcription in differentiated and non-differentiated cells. In thyroid cells, displacement of immobilized PKAII from perinuclear sites to the cytoplasm impaired cAMP-regulated transcription of the thyroglobulin gene (25Feliciello A. Giuliano P. Porcellini A.

We recently demonstrated that the assembly of AKAP75-PKAII complexes in the cortical cytoskeleton of HEK293 cells enhanced the propagation of cAMP signals to the nucleus, as shown by increased CREB/CRE-controlled gene transcription (27Feliciello A.

These data suggest the possibility that cells could control their sensitivity to hormones and/or developmental factors that activate adenylate cyclase by regulating the content and distribution of specific AKAPs. S-AKAP84 and its splice variant AKAP121, anchor PKAIIα to the cytoplasmic surface of mitochondria. The anchoring of PKAIIα may be involved in the translocation of mitochondria to the site of cytoskeleton assembly in male germ cells (28Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C., S. J. Biol.

Disruption of the targeting of PKAII in mammalian sperm may result in a reduction in sperm motility (30Vijayaraghavan S. Goueli S.A. Davey M.P. Carr D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4747-4752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Accumulation of S-AKAP84 and its cognate mRNA are developmentally regulated during sperm development. The anchor protein is expressed de novo during late spermiogenesis, and this is coincident with the maximal expression and subsequent anchoring of RIIα and RIIβ subunits (28Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C., S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).An important, but still open, question is how hormones and growth or developmental factors promote or regulate expression of AKAPs. Are cAMP, PKAs, and PKA-dependent protein phosphorylation involved in the regulation of the location and amounts of AKAP·PKAII complexes? In the present study, we describe the cloning and hormonal regulation of rat AKAP121. The expression and accumulation of AKAP121 is induced by a cAMP analog in rat thyroid cells (TL5) and mouse GC2 germ cells. TSH, which stimulates adenyl cyclase, also induces AKAP121 in thyroid cells. The cAMP-stimulated induction of AKAP121 mRNA is resistant to cycloheximide. These results suggest a mechanism whereby hormones promote signaling aimed at specific intracellular target sites.DISCUSSIONPKA isoenzymes are tethered and targeted to discrete intracellular microenvironments by AKAPs (4Rubin C.S.

Co-localization of PKA with adenylate cyclase may reduce effects of cAMP diffusion and augment PKA signaling when modest physiological levels of hormones encounter target cells (27Feliciello A.

The proximity of released catalytic PKA subunits to certain target/effectors also influences the propagation of cAMP signals in cells and focuses signals on specific effector molecules (22Rosenmund C.

A centrally important aspect of cAMP-PKA signaling is that spatially regulated accumulation of AKAPs, achieved by altering the intracellular distribution of PKAII isoenzymes, could influence cAMP signal dissemination to distal organelles. In granulosa cells, follicle-stimulating hormone induces a cytosolic translocation of PKAII coincident with an increase in the levels of an uncharacterized cytosolic RII-binding protein (36Carr D.W. De Manno D.A. Atwood A. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20729-20732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In spermatids, S-AKAP84 accumulates at the outer membrane of mitochondria at a late phase of development, the beginning of nuclear condensation and tail elongation (28Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C., S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). At present, molecular mechanisms underlying developmentally or hormone-regulated accumulation of anchor proteins are poorly understood.In differentiated thyroid cells, the binding of TSH to its cognate transmembrane receptor activates adenylate cyclase, which, in turn, increases the level of intracellular cAMP. Reversible phosphorylation of nuclear transacting factors by PKA is linked to transcriptional regulation of several genes (33Avvedimento V.E. Musti A.M. Ueffing M. Obici S. Gallo A. Sanchez M. DeBrasi D. Gottesman M.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Gallo A. Benusiglio E. Bonapace I.M. Feliciello A. Cassano S. Garbi C. Musti A.M. Gottesman M.E.

We have discovered that AKAP121 expression is regulated by the cAMP signal transduction pathway in thyroid-derived TL5 cells. TSH and/or cAMP induce AKAP121gene transcription and accumulation of AKAP121 mRNA and anchor protein. The transcriptional induction of AKAP121 mRNA is unaffected by cycloheximide, suggesting the presence of target sequences for PKA-dependent transcription factors in the promoter region of the AKAP121 gene (35Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). These data do not exclude the possibility that post-transcriptional mechanisms could also increase the stability of AKAP121 mRNA, thereby further facilitating accumulation of the transcript in response to cAMP.cAMP also markedly increases AKAP121 in GC2 spermatocytes with kinetics similar to that observed in TL5 cells. Thus, cAMP-induced expression of AKAP121 may represent a regulatory mechanism available in a variety of mammalian cells. The developmentally controlled biogenesis of S-AKAP84 in sperm cells is also regulated at the levels of transcription and/or mRNA stabilization in vivo (28Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C., S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether cAMP plays a role in this induction process. The observation that AKAP121 can be regulated by hormones (via cAMP signaling) in different cell systems suggests the occurrence of a positive feed-back loop between membrane-generated signals and organelle-specific targeting of AKAP121·PKAII complexes. This, ultimately, may modulate the sensitivity and/or the activity of mitochondrial target sites to cAMP action. Signaling mediated by cAMP and activation of protein kinase A (PKA)1 plays an essential role in the regulation of many important cellular activities, including motility, metabolism, differentiation, synaptic transmission, ion channel activities, growth, and coordination of gene transcription (1Edelman A.M.

The distinctive characteristics of the PKA holoenzymes are largely determined by the structure and properties of their R subunits. Unlike PKAI, which is typically cytosolic, PKAII (α and β) are often targeted to certain subcellular locations by specific anchor proteins (AKAPs) (4Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys.

The proximity of released catalytic PKA subunits to certain target/effectors also influences the propagation of cAMP signals in cells and focuses signals on specific effector molecules (22Rosenmund C.

A centrally important aspect of cAMP-PKA signaling is that spatially regulated accumulation of AKAPs, achieved by altering the intracellular distribution of PKAII isoenzymes, could influence cAMP signal dissemination to distal organelles. In granulosa cells, follicle-stimulating hormone induces a cytosolic translocation of PKAII coincident with an increase in the levels of an uncharacterized cytosolic RII-binding protein (36Carr D.W. De Manno D.A. Atwood A. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20729-20732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In spermatids, S-AKAP84 accumulates at the outer membrane of mitochondria at a late phase of development, the beginning of nuclear condensation and tail elongation (28Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C., S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). At present, molecular mechanisms underlying developmentally or hormone-regulated accumulation of anchor proteins are poorly understood. In differentiated thyroid cells, the binding of TSH to its cognate transmembrane receptor activates adenylate cyclase, which, in turn, increases the level of intracellular cAMP. Reversible phosphorylation of nuclear transacting factors by PKA is linked to transcriptional regulation of several genes (33Avvedimento V.E. Musti A.M. Ueffing M. Obici S. Gallo A. Sanchez M. DeBrasi D. Gottesman M.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Gallo A. Benusiglio E. Bonapace I.M. Feliciello A. Cassano S. Garbi C. Musti A.M. Gottesman M.E.

We have discovered that AKAP121 expression is regulated by the cAMP signal transduction pathway in thyroid-derived TL5 cells. TSH and/or cAMP induce AKAP121gene transcription and accumulation of AKAP121 mRNA and anchor protein. The transcriptional induction of AKAP121 mRNA is unaffected by cycloheximide, suggesting the presence of target sequences for PKA-dependent transcription factors in the promoter region of the AKAP121 gene (35Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). These data do not exclude the possibility that post-transcriptional mechanisms could also increase the stability of AKAP121 mRNA, thereby further facilitating accumulation of the transcript in response to cAMP. cAMP also markedly increases AKAP121 in GC2 spermatocytes with kinetics similar to that observed in TL5 cells. Thus, cAMP-induced expression of AKAP121 may represent a regulatory mechanism available in a variety of mammalian cells. The developmentally controlled biogenesis of S-AKAP84 in sperm cells is also regulated at the levels of transcription and/or mRNA stabilization in vivo (28Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C., S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether cAMP plays a role in this induction process. The observation that AKAP121 can be regulated by hormones (via cAMP signaling) in different cell systems suggests the occurrence of a positive feed-back loop between membrane-generated signals and organelle-specific targeting of AKAP121·PKAII complexes. This, ultimately, may modulate the sensitivity and/or the activity of mitochondrial target sites to cAMP action."
https://openalex.org/W2114733447,"Abstract We have investigated the in vitrofidelity of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme from a wild-type and a proofreading-impaired mutD5 strain. Exonuclease assays showed the mutD5 holoenzyme to have a 30–50-fold reduced 3′→5′-exonuclease activity. Fidelity was assayed during gap-filling synthesis across the lacI dforward mutational target. The error rate for both enzymes was lowest at low dNTP concentrations (10–50 μM) and highest at high dNTP concentration (1000 μM). The mutD5 proofreading defect increased the error rate by only 3–5-fold. Both enzymes produced a high level of (−1)-frameshift mutations in addition to base substitutions. The base substitutions were mainly C→T, G→T, and G→C, but dNTP pool imbalances suggested that these may reflect misincorporations opposite damaged template bases and that, instead, T→C, G→A, and C→T transitions represent the normal polymerase III-mediated base·base mispairs. The frequent (−1)-frameshift mutations do not result from direct slippage but may be generated via a mechanism involving “misincorporation plus slippage.” Measurements of the fidelity of wild-type and mutD5 holoenzyme during M13 in vivo replication revealed significant differences between the in vivo and in vitro fidelity with regard to both the frequency of frameshift errors and the extent of proofreading."

We have identified the parts of FREAC-2 responsible fortrans-activation and found two functionally redundant activation domains on the C-terminal side of the DNA binding forkhead domain. Activation domain 1 consists of the most C-terminal 23 amino acids of FREAC-2 and contains a sequence motif conserved in an activation domain of another forkhead protein, FREAC-1. Activation domain 2 is built up by three synergistic subdomains in the central part of the FREAC-2 protein. FREAC-2 was shown to interact in vitro with TBP and TFIIB. The target site for FREAC-2 on TBP was localized to the N-terminal repeat in the core domain of TBP. TFIIB binds FREAC-2 close to the cleft between its two globular domains. The part of FREAC-2 that binds TBP was mapped to 21 amino acids in the C-terminal end of the forkhead domain. This sequence is well conserved among forkhead proteins, raising the possibility that interaction with TBP may be a general characteristic of this family of transcription factors.

Genes encoding transcription factors that contain a forkhead DNA binding domain have been found in eucaryotic organisms from the simplest unicellular fungi to mammals. It appears, however, to be in the evolution of metazoans that this gene family expanded to the complexity that we see in today's vertebrates. Whereas, for example, the entire genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Goffeau, A. et al. (1997) Nature 387,(suppl.) 1–105Google Scholar) contains 4 genes with a forkhead motif, over 50 mammalian forkhead genes have been cloned so far (reviewed in Ref. 2Kaufmann E. Knochel W. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, forkhead genes are involved in embryogenesis and pattern formation in multicellular organisms. In fact, all known examples of inactivation of forkhead genes result in more or less dramatic disturbances of embryogenesis (3Ang S.L. Rossant J.

Neuron. 1997; 18: 539-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). How is functional specificity maintained within a gene family with so many closely related members? One level of specificity is DNA binding. Distantly related members of the forkhead family may bind to completely distinct DNA sequences (15Li C. Lai C.F. Sigman D.S. Gaynor R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7739-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16Sutton J. Costa R. Klug M. Field L. Xu D. Largaespada D.A. Fletcher C.F. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Klemsz M. Hromas R.

A. 1997; 94: 3842-3847Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Even in cases in which the DNA binding domains are more closely related and the binding specificities are overlapping, there can—as in the case of FREAC-31 and FREAC-4 (18Pierrou S. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 229: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)—be differences in the relative affinities for a particular sequence that may have profound biological significance (18Pierrou S. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 229: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 20Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell.

There are, however, also several examples of forkhead proteins in which the DNA binding domains are so similar that it is reasonable to assume that the specificities are identical. The most extreme example is that of FREAC-4 and FREAC-9, two human forkhead proteins that are encoded by different genes and are coexpressed in certain cells. FREAC-4 and FREAC-9 have DNA binding domains with 100% identity throughout their 105 amino acids, but they have no homologies outside the forkhead domains (22Ernstsson S. Betz R. Lagercrantz S. Larsson C. Erickson S. Cederberg A. Carlsson P. Enerbäck S. Genomics. 1997; 46: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In such cases, the proteins will either be functionally redundant, as appears to be the case with the two forkhead genes in thesloppy paired locus of Drosophila (23Cadigan K.M. Grossniklaus U. Gehring W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6324-6328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), or specificity will reside in other functions than DNA binding. An example that illustrates that forkhead proteins expressed in the same tissue and with indistinguishable DNA binding specificities can have distinct biological functions is that of FREAC-1 and FREAC-2. Although both proteins bind to and activate the surfactant protein B promoter, the gene for another lung-specific protein, CC10, is only activated by FREAC-1 due to the presence of a cell type-specific activation domain in FREAC-1 (24Hellqvist M. Mahlapuu M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4482-4490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The DNA binding function of forkhead proteins is well understood (25Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar), but far less is known about their activities as transcriptional regulators. The majority of forkhead proteins that have been experimentally analyzed appear to be transcriptional activators, but only in a few cases have the regions of the proteins responsible for activation been identified. HNF3β activate transcription through four regions (26Qian X. Costa R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1184-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and Whn, encoded by the nude locus, contains an acidic activation domain in the C terminus (27Schuddekopf K. Schorpp M. Boehm T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9661-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The human forkhead protein FKHR has a potent activation domain that, when fused to the heterologous DNA binding domain of PAX3 by a translocation, is responsible for malignant transformation in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (28Scheidler S. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher F.r. Barr F.G. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9805-9809Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 29Bennicelli J.L. Edwards R.H. Barr F.G. Proc. Natl.

Transcriptional trans-repression is known from Genesis, a forkhead protein expressed in embryonic stem cells (16Sutton J. Costa R. Klug M. Field L. Xu D. Largaespada D.A. Fletcher C.F. Jenkins N.A.

A. 1993; 90: 4490-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the latter case, the repression domain is essential for the transforming ability of the oncogenic version of the protein, v-Qin (33Li J. Chang H.W. Lai E. Parker E.J. Vogt P.K.

Interaction with other cellular components is necessary for transcription factors in conveying biological signals. Again, we know very little about the interactions made by forkhead proteins, but a role in the remodeling of chromatin structure as a step in transcriptional activation has been proposed (35McPherson C.E. Shim E.Y. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 387-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). TheXenopus forkhead protein FAST-1 has been identified as a direct target for transforming growth factor-β/activin signaling and shown to form a complex with the transforming growth factor-β signal transducer XMAD2 (36Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The forkhead-associated domain is a sequence motif found in some forkhead proteins, as well as in certain protein kinases, that has been proposed to participate in nuclear signaling (37Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 347-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The human forkhead gene FREAC-2 is, in the adult, expressed only in lung and placenta (19Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), and the encoded protein is a transcriptional activator (24Hellqvist M. Mahlapuu M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4482-4490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). FREAC-2 binds the consensus sequence AACGTAAACAA (18Pierrou S. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. Anal.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), and the amino acid sequence of the DNA binding domain is virtually identical to that of another human forkhead protein, FREAC-1 (24Hellqvist M. Mahlapuu M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4482-4490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The promoters of a number of genes that are specifically expressed in lung, including the genes for surfactant apoproteins, contain binding sites for FREAC-2 (24Hellqvist M. Mahlapuu M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4482-4490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Herein, we describe mapping of functional domains in FREAC-2. We have identified the regions responsible for transcriptional activation and also shown that FREAC-2 interacts with components of the basal transcriptional machinery. Finally, we have addressed the issue of subcellular localization and identified the parts of FREAC-2 that targets the protein to the nucleus. The FREAC-2 expression plasmid has been described elsewhere (24Hellqvist M. Mahlapuu M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4482-4490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Constructs expressing truncated FREAC-2 proteins were generated by creating deletions in the FREAC-2 plasmid with restriction enzymes or Bal31 exonuclease. Triple alanine substitution mutations in the FREAC-2 coding sequence were generated with oligonucleotide directed in vitro mutagenesis, essentially as described previously (38Carlsson P. Waterman M.L. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2418-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), using the following mutagenic primers: GCCATCGAATGCCACGCGGCCGCCACGAGCCCTGCGGC (m295–297), AAGCAGCCGCCTGCCGCGGCCGCCAGCAGCAACCCCGC (m319–321), TCCAGCATGTCCTCCGCGGCCGCGGAGCAGAGCTACTT (m338–340), GTGGGACTGCCCCGTGCGGCCGCTCACTCTACTCCAGT (m360–362), and AATGGGATTTCTTCTGCGGCCGCCTCAGCTAGCGGGTC (m383–385). The m173 mutant was created by insertion of a double-stranded oligonucleotide adapter (GCGGCCGCACGC and TGCGGCCGCGCG) into the unique DraIII site of FREAC-2. Internal, in frame deletions in FREAC-2 were created by joining fragments from the triple alanine substitution constructs at the NotI sites introduced by mutagenesis. A vector for expression of Gal4 fusions (pNG4) was created by insertion of a polylinker (CCGGAATTGTCGACTGCGGCCGCAAGCTTTCTAGATAGCTAGCTAG) downstream of codon 147 of Gal4 in pCMV-Gal4 (38Carlsson P. Waterman M.L. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2418-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Constructs expressing amino-terminally truncated FREAC-2 proteins fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain were then made by cloningNotI–XbaI fragments from the triple alanine substitution constructs between the corresponding sites in pNG4. Fragments encoding internal regions of the FREAC-2trans-activation domain were generated by polymerase chain reaction with primers tagged with SalI (forward) and XbaI (reverse) sites. These polymerase chain reaction products were inserted between the SalI and XbaI sites of pNG4 and verified by sequencing. The reporter 4×FREAC-luc (24Hellqvist M. Mahlapuu M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4482-4490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) contains four FREAC-2 binding sites upstream of a minimal apoB promoter that drives the expression of luciferase. To create a reporter construct for Gal4 fusion proteins (Gal4-luc), six copies of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a Gal4 binding site (GATCCGGACTGTCCTCCGAGATC) was cloned into theBglII site of apoB-luc (24Hellqvist M. Mahlapuu M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4482-4490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). FREAC-2 expression constructs were modified for in vitrotranscription-translation by deleting the SacI fragment containing the CMV promoter in the pEVRF0 vector (39Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schreiber E. Rusconi S. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), thereby moving the T7 promoter of the vector immediately upstream of the FREAC-2 cDNA sequence. To express TFIIB in mammalian cells, the human TFIIB cDNA (40Malik S. Hisatake K. Sumimoto H. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9553-9557Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was cloned between the BamHI and XbaI sites of pEV3S (39Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schreiber E. Rusconi S. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cell lines COS-7 and HepG2 were grown on collagen-coated plastic in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin and streptomycin. Liposome-mediated transfections were performed as described previously (24Hellqvist M. Mahlapuu M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4482-4490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) in 24-well tissue culture plates using Lipofectin or LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two days posttransfection, the medium was removed, and the cells were rinsed once with 0.5× Tris-buffered saline (1× Tris-buffered saline is 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 130 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2). Cell lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) was added (50 μl/well), and the plates were incubated on ice for 15 min. When extracts for gel shift assays should be made from the nuclei after the luciferase assay, protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml each of leupeptin, chymostatin and aprotinin; 5 μg/ml each of pepstatin A and antipain; 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were included in the cell lysis buffer. The plates were tilted, and the cytoplasmic extract was carefully removed, without disturbing the nuclei attached to the bottom of the well, and assayed for luciferase activity. The plates were put back on ice, and 30 μl of nuclear extraction buffer (100 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 500 mm KCl, 25 mmMgCl2, 35% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors) was added to each well. The contents of the wells were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes and cleared by centrifugation. Supernatants were diluted 5-fold with H2O and assayed for FREAC-2 or Gal4 DNA binding activities in gel shifts (24Hellqvist M. Mahlapuu M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. J. Biol.

Each construct was transfected in duplicate in at least three independent transfections. Amino acids 146–408 of FREAC-2 was expressed as a histidine-tagged protein in Escherichia coli M15[pREP4] using the vector pQE30 (Qiagen). Induced bacteria were lysed in 6 m guanidine-HCl, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0, and mixed with nickel-NTA (Qiagen) resin. The resin was packed in a column and washed with 8m urea, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0 (Buffer B), and the bound protein was renatured with a linear gradient from Buffer B to 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% NaN3 using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC.

Coupled in vitro transcription-translation of general transcription factors and parts of FREAC-2 was performed with TNT-T7 (Promega) and [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In vitro-translated general transcription factors were mixed with FREAC-2/nickel-NTA beads, and in vitro-translated FREAC-2 peptides were mixed with TBP-Sepharose beads in 50 μl of 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. When nickel-NTA beads were used, 10 mm imidazole was included in the binding and washing buffers to eliminate nonspecific binding. To verify that retention of the labeled protein was due to true protein-protein interactions, rather than being mediated by protein-DNA interactions, 35 units of DNase I was included in the binding reaction. Control binding reactions were performed with nickel-NTA beads or protein A-Sepharose beads saturated with 12CA5 monoclonal antibody. The binding reactions were rocked gently for 1 h at 4 °C, and the beads were collected by low speed centrifugation and washed four times with binding buffer. Bound proteins were detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. The FREAC-2 cDNA and parts thereof generated by polymerase chain reaction were cloned between the BamHI and XbaI sites in the GFP fusion vector pGFP-C1 (CLONTECH). Transfection of these constructs into COS-7 cells generated fusion proteins in which parts of FREAC-2 are fused to the C terminus of GFP. Cells were seeded on a coverslip in a tissue culture dish and transfected with liposomes as described above. Twenty-four hours posttransfection, the cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted in a drop of phosphate-buffered saline on a microscope slide. The subcellular localization of the fusion proteins was visualized in vivoby fluorescence microscopy and photographed through a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set To define which parts of the FREAC-2 protein are responsible fortrans-activation of transcription, we generated a series of 5′ and 3′ deletions in the FREAC-2 cDNA (Fig. 1 A). Expression constructs for these truncated FREAC-2 proteins were transfected into mammalian cell lines together with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing FREAC-2 binding sites upstream of a minimal promoter. Several cell lines derived from different tissues, including the lung cell lines NIH-H441 and WI38, were tested, and the activation properties of the FREAC-2 derivatives were found to be similar in all of the cell lines. We therefore chose to use the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 and the monkey kidney cell line COS-7, because high and reproducible transfection efficiencies were obtained with these cells. Deletion of the amino acids on the N-terminal side of the forkhead domain did not influence activation by FREAC-2, whereas deletions from the C-terminal end reduced its activation of the reporter (Fig. 1 A). To establish whether the drop in activity reflects removal of activation domains or simply instability of the truncated proteins, we made extracts from the nuclei of transfected cells and used gel shift to assay for proteins with FREAC-2 DNA binding specificity. As shown in Fig. 1 C, two of the truncated proteins (1–387 and 1–293) were partially degraded, and the luciferase activities produced in the corresponding transfections (Fig. 1 A) are therefore unreliable. However, the rest of the proteins appear to be stable and to bind DNA normally. FREAC-2 proteins truncated at amino acid 241 or 189 inhibit luciferase expression from the reporter to less than 5% of the value obtained with cotransfection of the empty cloning vector. The mechanism behind this inhibition is not known, but the simplest explanation is that endogenous forkhead proteins with overlapping DNA binding specificities are capable of activating the reporter and are displaced by FREAC-2. Consistent with this explanation, the 4×FREAC-luc reporter produces an activity severalfold higher than the corresponding construct without FREAC-2 sites, apoB-luc, and the truncated FREAC-2 proteins fail to inhibit the luciferase expression from apoB-luc (data not shown). The 1–328 truncated protein activates with approximately one-half the potency of the full-length protein, and further deletions, moving the C terminus of the protein from 328 to 241, resulted in a 100-fold drop in activity. We took this to indicate the importance of amino acid sequences between 241 and 328 for transcriptional activation, with a possible contribution from regions C-terminal of 328. To analyze this part of the protein further, we used in vitro mutagenesis to introduce six triple alanine substitutions in the part of the FREAC-2 protein C-terminal of the forkhead DNA binding domain. The restriction enzyme sites introduced by mutagenesis were also used to create internal deletions in the FREAC-2 cDNA (Fig. 1 B). Surprisingly, deletions in the region between 241 and 328 did not lead to significant reductions of activity. In fact, deletion of everything C-terminal of the forkhead domain, except for the last 23 amino acids (Δ173–385), did not impair transcriptional activation by FREAC-2 in this assay (Fig. 1 B). This result suggested that the most C-terminal 23 amino acids of FREAC-2 can act as an independent activation domain. To test whether this is the case or the context of the DNA binding forkhead domain is a prerequisite for activation, we fused segments of different length from the C-terminal half of FREAC-2 with the DNA binding domain of Gal4. When the ability of these fusion proteins to activate a reporter containing multiple Gal4 binding sites were analyzed, the most C-terminal 23 amino acids of FREAC-2 were again found to act as a potent and independent activation domain (Fig. 2 A). This part of the FREAC-2 protein will be referred to as activation domain 1 (AD1). The results of transfections with deletion mutants and Gal4 fusions suggested that FREAC-2 contains at least two independent and functionally redundant activation domains. More specifically, the 100-fold difference between 1–241 and 1–328 (Fig. 1 A) indicated the presence of activating sequences in the central part of the protein (from now on referred to as activation domain 2 (AD2)), whereas the activities of Δ173–385 and G4(386–408) (Figs. 1 B and 2 A) define AD1 in the C terminus. As the results of the internal deletions showed (Fig. 1 B), it was impossible to investigate AD2 with AD1 present; even deletion of more than half the FREAC-2 protein (Δ173–385) did not reduce activity as long as AD1 was left intact (Fig. 1 B). Analysis of AD2 was further complicated by the fact that a precise deletion of AD1 from FREAC-2 (1–387) yielded an unstable protein (Fig. 1 C). To identify the activating regions that constitute AD2, we therefore fused sequences from the internal part of FREAC-2 to the DNA binding domain of Gal4. The 212 amino acids from the C-terminal end of the forkhead domain to the N-terminal end of AD1 (amino acids 174–388) were divided into four subregions of 51–56 amino acids each (Fig. 2 B). When analyzed by cotransfection with the Gal4-luciferase reporter, the first (174–225), second (225–278), and fourth (332–388) subregions contributed to activation (Fig. 2 B). Individually, none of the subregions produced any substantial activation, but together (G4(174–388)), they acted in a synergistic manner and activated the Gal4 reporter 150-fold (Fig. 2 B). Judged from gel shifts with extracts from transfected cells, all the FREAC-2/Gal4 fusion proteins, except G4(174–408), appear to be stable and to bind DNA normally (Fig. 2 C). In the case of G4(174–408) the major part of the Gal4 DNA binding activity consists of dimers of just the Gal4 DNA binding domain, which arise from proteolysis, and very little of the full-length dimer is seen. Because the truncated Gal4 dimers bind DNA and compete with the full-length protein for the binding sites but do not activate transcription, this may account for the lower activity of G4(174–408) compared with G4(174–388). The parts of FREAC-2 responsible for activation of transcription thus appear to be located in the region C-terminal of the forkhead domain. To investigate whether this part of the protein interacts through direct protein-protein binding with components of the transcriptional preinitiation complex, we used a pull-down assay. Amino acids 146–408 of FREAC-2 were expressed in bacteria as a His-tagged protein and immobilized on a nickel-agarose affinity matrix. Human general transcription factors, synthesized and 35S-labeled byin vitro translation, were assayed for specific binding to the FREAC-2 coated beads (Fig. 3). TFIIA (the 55-kDa precursor of the α- and β-subunits), TFIIB, TBP, TFIIEα, TFIIEβ, TAFII32, and TAFII55 were tested. Two proteins, TBP and TFIIB, were found to interact specifically with FREAC-2, whereas none bound to the control beads consisting of nickel-agarose (Fig. 3). The domains of the general transcription factors responsible for the interaction with FREAC-2 were mapped by repeating the FREAC-2 binding assay with truncated forms of TBP and TFIIB (Fig. 4).

Here we report the solution structure of full-length recombinant quail CRP2 as determined by multi-dimensional triple-resonance NMR spectroscopy. The structural analysis revealed that the global fold of the two LIM domains in the context of the full-length protein is identical to the recently determined solution structures of the isolated individual LIM domains of quail CRP2. There is no preference in relative spatial orientation of the two domains. This supports the view that the two LIM domains are independent structural and presumably functional modules of CRP proteins. This is also reflected by the dynamic properties of CRP2 probed by15N relaxation values (T 1,T 2, and nuclear Overhauser effect). A model-free analysis revealed local variations in mobility along the backbone of the two LIM domains in the native protein, similar to those observed for the isolated domains. Interestingly, fast and slow motions observed in the 58-amino acid linker region between the two LIM domains endow extensive motional freedom to CRP2. The dynamic analysis indicates independent backbone mobility of the two LIM domains and rules out correlated LIM domain motion in full-length CRP2.

So far, no structure determination has been performed for a native LIM protein containing more than one LIM domain, and it has not been assessed yet whether the global fold of an isolated individual LIM domain remains unchanged in the context of a full-sized protein containing multiple LIM domains. Furthermore, the intriguing question of whether the LIM domains within a protein containing multiple copies of this motif have a preferential spatial orientation to each other or even display distinct direct interactions has not been addressed yet.Here we describe the solution structure of uniformly13C/15N-labeled full-length quail CRP2, representing the first structure determination for a protein containing multiple LIM domains, and compare it to the structures of the isolated amino-terminal LIM1 and carboxyl-terminal LIM2 domains from the same protein. Furthermore, the backbone dynamics of CRP2 were investigated using two-dimensional 15N-1H NMR methods to determine steady-state 1H-15N NOE values and the T 1 and T 2 relaxation times of 15N magnetization. The results provide unequivocal evidence that the two LIM domains of CRP2 are autonomously folded structural modules with independent backbone mobility and no preference in relative spatial orientation.

So far, no structure determination has been performed for a native LIM protein containing more than one LIM domain, and it has not been assessed yet whether the global fold of an isolated individual LIM domain remains unchanged in the context of a full-sized protein containing multiple LIM domains. Furthermore, the intriguing question of whether the LIM domains within a protein containing multiple copies of this motif have a preferential spatial orientation to each other or even display distinct direct interactions has not been addressed yet. Here we describe the solution structure of uniformly13C/15N-labeled full-length quail CRP2, representing the first structure determination for a protein containing multiple LIM domains, and compare it to the structures of the isolated amino-terminal LIM1 and carboxyl-terminal LIM2 domains from the same protein. Furthermore, the backbone dynamics of CRP2 were investigated using two-dimensional 15N-1H NMR methods to determine steady-state 1H-15N NOE values and the T 1 and T 2 relaxation times of 15N magnetization. The results provide unequivocal evidence that the two LIM domains of CRP2 are autonomously folded structural modules with independent backbone mobility and no preference in relative spatial orientation.

Detailed quantification shows that the closed complex detected has the same binding constant as that determined in kinetic studies. The footprinting pattern of the closed complex shows major differences from that of the open complex. Not only is it about 20 base pairs shorter, there are also many fewer positions being protected around and upstream of the −35 region. We have derived potential contact regions in the closed and open complexes based on the DNase I footprinting patterns, and confirmed the contact region for the open complex by hydroxyl radical footprinting. One important finding is that most of the essential contacts with the phosphate groups in the −35 region are formed during the isomerization step, a conclusion consistent with our kinetic data showing that this step is salt dependent on this promoter. In addition, we found that the derived contact regions for the closed and open complexes are offset by about three base pairs in the −35 region, which suggests a shift of the contact during isomerization.

The frequency of transcription initiation in Escherichia coli is determined primarily by the rate of formation of the transcriptionally active RNA polymerase-promoter complex, the open complex. The process of open complex formation can be described by the following two-step model (1Record M.T. Reznikoff W.S. Craig M.L. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.J. Neidhardt F.C.

Subsequently, the closed complex isomerizes into the open complex with a rate constant k f. The first step is in rapid equilibrium, while the second step is usually rate-limiting and leads almost irreversibly to the formation of the open complex (RPo). The structural properties of the open complex have been studied extensively. It is known that the promoter DNA in the open complex has a melted region extending approximately from the −10 region to the transcription start site (1Record M.T. Reznikoff W.S. Craig M.L.

There is also a wealth of information about the RNA polymerase-promoter DNA interaction in the open complexes formed on different promoters from studies using both enzymatic and chemical probing techniques, such as DNase I footprinting (3Ozoline O.N.

In contrast to the open complex, our understanding of the closed complex is very limited. The existence of the closed complex is based largely on kinetic analysis (1Record M.T. Reznikoff W.S.

Biol. 1982; 155: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the observation that RNA polymerase can bind specifically to promoters at 0 °C where open complex formation does not occur (13Williams R.C. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3740-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Complexes formed on thelac UV5 and the T7-A3 promoters at 0 °C have also been studied using DNase I footprinting (14Kovacic R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13654-13661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Footprinting using several chemical reagents has been studied at the T7A1 promoter as a function of temperature (15Zaychikov E. Denissova L. Meier T. Gotte M. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2259-2267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether these complexes are the same as the closed complexes that form transiently during open complex formation under normal transcription conditions. Because detailed information regarding RNA polymerase-promoter interaction in the closed complex is important for understanding the mechanism of open complex formation, we have characterized the closed complex formed on the phage λ prmup-1Δ265 promoter using DNase I footprinting. Kinetic studies were performed to find suitable reaction conditions for the footprinting studies. Under the conditions chosen, we have been able to footprint the closed complex before a significant amount of open complex could form. The binding constant determined from the footprint analysis is in good agreement with the binding constant determined from kinetic assays, providing strong evidence that the footprinted complex is the closed complex proposed in the two-step model. Since only partial closed complex formation could be achieved under the experimental conditions, we have determined the fractional protection at each position by carrying out quantitative DNase I footprinting at several RNA polymerase concentrations. The analysis of these data permits the protection pattern of fully-formed closed complexes to be determined. The results show that the closed complex is distinct from that of the open complex, indicating significant changes in the RNA polymerase-promoter interaction during open complex formation. We also show that the DNase I footprint of the complex formed at 4 °C has both similarities to and differences from that of the closed complex formed at higher temperatures. In addition, we have performed hydroxyl radical footprinting studies of the open complex. A 564-base pairHindIII-EcoRI fragment containing the bacteriophage λ prmup-1Δ265 promoter was isolated from λ112prmup-1Δ265 phage (16Meyer B.J. Maurer R. Ptashne M. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 163-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) DNA and cloned into the pUC-13 plasmid. The prmup-1 mutation is a single base pair change (T → C) at −31 in the λPRM promoter; the Δ265 deletion removes the divergently oriented λPR promoter. This DNA fragment was used both for abortive initiation assays and the footprinting experiments. When used for footprinting analysis, this DNA fragment was labeled at the EcoRI end either on the top strand with [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), or the bottom strand by filling in opposite the 5′ overhanging end with [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Life Technologies, Inc.). E. coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme was isolated according to Burgess and Jendrisak (17Burgess R.R. Jendrisak J.J. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) and Lowe et al. (18Lowe P.A. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1344-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and its activity (40%) was determined as described by Hawley and McClure (19Hawley D.K. McClure W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 493-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The concentrations reported here correspond to active holoenzyme. Abortive initiation assays were used to determine the kinetics of open complex formation as have been reported (19Hawley D.K. McClure W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 493-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The calculation of the apparent rate constant of open complex formation (k obs) was based on the kinetics of the accumulation of abortive initiation product (the lag experiment) using a least-squares fitting program. The calculation of the RNA polymerase binding constant (K B) and the rate constant (k f) for isomerization from the closed complex into the open complex was based on plots of τobs(1/k obs) versus reciprocal RNA polymerase concentration according to Equation 1, as described previously (19Hawley D.K. McClure W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 493-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).τobs=1/kf+1/KBkf[R](Eq. 1) The abortive initiation reaction reported here contains 0.25 nm prmup-1Δ265 promoter DNA fragment, RNA polymerase of varying concentrations, 500 μm UpA (Sigma), and 50 μm [α-32P]UTP (final specific activity was 200–600 cpm/pmol; [α-32P]UTP was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Unless otherwise specified, the standard assay buffer contained: 30 mm Hepes (pH 7.5, adjusted with potassium hydroxide), 200 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The reason for us to use potassium glutamate instead of KCl in these studies is that it increases the binding constant of the closed complex,K B, without changing the mechanism of open complex formation (20Leirmo S. Harrison C. Cayley D.S. Burgess R.R. Record M.T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This allowed footprinting studies of the closed complex to be performed at a lower and wider range of RNA polymerase concentrations. Transcription complexes were formed with 0.25 nm labeled prmup-1Δ265 promoter DNA and RNA polymerase at varying concentrations in 87 μl of reaction buffer containing 0.1 mm CaCl2. The DNase I cleavage reaction was started with the addition of 5 μl of 15 μg/ml DNase I, and allowed to proceed for 30 s before being stopped with the addition of 12.5 μl of 0.2 m EDTA, 5 μl of 10% SDS, and 3 μl of 3.33 mg/ml tRNA. The samples were incubated at 65 °C for 20 min, then on ice for 10 min. The precipitate formed contained denatured proteins in complex with potassium-SDS, and was removed by centrifugation. The DNA sample in the supernatant was further purified by repeated ethanol precipitation, and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 9% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea sequencing gel. Autoradiography was performed with a Kodak X-Omat AR film. The hydroxyl radical footprinting was as described (21Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5469-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Open complexes were formed with 0.25 nmlabeled DNA fragment and 60 nm RNA polymerase in 87 μl of standard reaction buffer following an incubation of 25 min at 25 °C. The sample was shifted to 19 °C, and incubated further for 30 min. Then, 1.5 μl each of the following solutions was added: 1.2 mg/ml heparin, 6 mm Fe(II)EDTA (6 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate and 12 mm EDTA), and 250 mm sodium ascorbate. The hydroxyl radical footprinting reaction was started with the addition of 1.5 μl of 6% H2O2, and was stopped following 30 s of incubation by the addition of 750 μl of stopping solution (60 ml of 1.0 m thiourea, 70 μl of 1.0 m sodium acetate, 3 μl of 3.33 mg/ml tRNA, and 620 μl of 95% ethanol). The samples were put into a dry ice-ethanol bath. The DNA was isolated by centrifugation, and reprecipitated with ethanol. The samples were further purified by SDS-potassium precipitation and ethanol precipitation, and were analyzed in a sequencing gel as described above. The autoradiograms were scanned in one dimension with a Zeineh 2D/1D densitometer (Biomedical Instrument Inc.); air was used as background to adjust absorbance to zero during scanning. In the scanning, we used a laser beam slightly wider than the darkest band in the autoradiogram being analyzed. Therefore, the average optical density of the area covered by the laser beam was measured. This compensated for the variations in band intensities and shapes, which have been considered to be the major causes for inaccuracy in the analysis using one-dimensional scanning (22Brenowitz M. Senear D.F. Shea M.A. Ackers G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8462-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The densitometer tracing of a blank area of the autoradiogram was used for background subtraction of the sample lanes. To calculate the fractional protection of each feature in the footprints of the RNA polymerase-promoter complexes, the integration values were corrected for the small variations in the total amount of DNA loaded in each lane using normalization band(s), which did not change upon transcription complex formation (see Fig. 3). The fractional protection (F pro) was calculated as shown by Equation 2.Fpro=(Ao−A)/Ao(Eq. 2) A was the normalized integration value of a protected feature (i.e. band or group of bands), and A o was the integration value of the corresponding feature in the control without RNA polymerase. The fractional protection (F pro) in the DNase I footprint was assumed to be proportional to the fractional occupancy. Based on Reaction 1, the closed complex is in a rapid equilibrium with free RNA polymerase and promoter DNA. Therefore, the fractional protection of the closed complex is related to RNA polymerase concentration as shown in the following equation.1/Fpro=1/Fmax+1/FmaxKB[R](Eq. 3) F max is the maximum fractional protection of a feature when closed complex formation is complete. Therefore, from a double-reciprocal plot of F pro versus [R], K B is calculated as the intercept divided by the slope; the maximum fractional protection,F max, is obtained as the inverse of the intercept. Kinetic analysis of open complex formation served two purposes in the studies reported here. First, we used it as a tool to find suitable conditions for DNase I footprinting of the closed complex; second, the results provided a comparison between the functional assays and the footprinting results. For the first purpose, we determined the kinetics of open complex formation at several reaction temperatures, and in different buffers. The abortive initiation assay as described previously (19Hawley D.K. McClure W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 493-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) was used to determine both the binding constant (K B) of the closed complex, and the rate constant (k f)) for the isomerization of the closed complex into the open complex. The results of the kinetic experiments performed under several of the conditions studied are shown in Table I. Open complex formation on this promoter is dependent on salt concentration. The salt concentration dependence of the second order rate constant,K B k f), measured at 25 °C corresponds to the release of about 9 (8.7 ± 1.2) counterions during open complex formation based on calculations using the equations of Record and co-workers (20Leirmo S. Harrison C. Cayley D.S. Burgess R.R. Record M.T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 23deHaseth P.L. Lohman T.M. Burgess R.R. Record M.T.J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1612-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This is similar to the results reported for the λ PR and λ PR′ promoters by Leirmo et al. (20Leirmo S. Harrison C. Cayley D.S. Burgess R.R. Record M.T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We found that both steps of open complex formation were salt-dependent on theprmup-1Δ265 promoter, while Leirmo et al. have shown that only the first step was salt-dependent on the λ PR and PR′ promoters.Table IKinetic data for open complex formation on the prmup-1Δ265 promoter from the abortive initiation assayConditionsK Bk fK B k f× 10 m× 10 s× 10 msKCl 100 mm, 19 °C1.54 (0.36)2.2 (0.44)3.4 (0.43)KGlu 200 mm, 19 °C8.5 (1.6)1.8 (0.19)15.3 (2.3) 200 mm, 25 °C8.4 (1.4)8.9 (0.86)74.6 (10.0) 300 mm, 25 °C2.2 (1.2)5.0 (2.2)11.1 (3.5) 400 mm, 25 °C0.79 (0.36)2.2 (0.96)1.8 (0.26)The buffer contained 40 mm TrisCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin.Errors (± 1 S.D.) are in parentheses as described under “Materials and Methods.”The buffers contained 30 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and potassium glutamate (KGlu) at the concentrations specified in the table.

Errors (± 1 S.D.) are in parentheses as described under “Materials and Methods.” The buffers contained 30 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and potassium glutamate (KGlu) at the concentrations specified in the table. Based on the kinetic studies described above, we chose to perform most of our footprinting experiments under the following standard conditions: assay buffer containing 200 mm potassium glutamate and a reaction temperature of 19 °C. Our footprinting studies of the closed complex involve a short DNase I digestion reaction (30 s) carried out right after RNA polymerase was mixed with promoter DNA (30 s). A calculation using the kinetic data described above predicted that the fraction of open complex formed should be less than 5% at all of the RNA polymerase concentrations used under our footprinting conditions, and is negligible comparing to the fraction of closed complex formed. Fig. 1 shows the autoradiograms obtained from DNase I footprinting on both the top and the bottom strands.Lane 2 shows the footprint obtained 30 s after RNA polymerase (20 nm) was mixed with promoter DNA; significant protection is apparent in the promoter region, particularly around the −10 region. A calculation using the K Band k f) values shown in Table I predicted that the fraction of the closed complex formed should be about 63% while that of the open complex formed should be less than 5% under the conditions used. Therefore, this protection is likely to be caused primarily by the formation of the closed complex. In support of this, we found that such protection was completely sensitive to heparin challenge (lane 3). In addition, the footprint is distinct from that of the open complex (lane 4). In general, extensive protection seems to be restricted to the region from about −30 to +10 in the closed complex, while the protection covers the whole promoter region in the open complex (see below). If the complex detected right after RNA polymerase was mixed with promoter DNA is the closed complex depicted in the two-step model, it is expected to form in a RNA polymerase concentration-dependent manner and to have a binding constant that is the same as K B derived from functional assays described above. To confirm that this is the case, we carried out DNase I footprinting analysis at varying RNA polymerase concentrations. The autoradiogram resulting from one such experiment performed with the promoter DNA labeled on the top strand is shown in Fig. 2. As expected, the extent of protection in the promoter region increased with increasing RNA polymerase concentrations. To determine the binding constant, we quantified the fractional protection at each RNA polymerase concentration by densitometry scanning. In these analyses, small variations in the amount of DNA loaded to each lane were normalized based on the intensities of the normalization bands, which corresponded to positions −39 and −40 on the top strand and −35 on the bottom strand. Fig. 3 shows that DNase I cleavage at these positions was not significantly affected by the binding of RNA polymerase. We determined the fractional protection for the entire protected regions, single bands, or small groups of bands. Subsequently, using double-reciprocal plots of fractional protection versus RNA polymerase concentration, we determined the binding constant of the closed complex. Fig. 4 A shows several examples of such plots, and the binding constants derived from these as well as several other similar plots are summarized in Table II, part A. We observed good agreement between the binding constants determined for different portions of the footprint and the whole protected regions of both strands of the promoter DNA. Importantly, these binding constants are, within experimental error, the same as the K B value measured by the abortive initiation assays under the same conditions. Therefore, the complex detected in the footprinting analysis indeed is the closed complex intermediate proposed in the two-step kinetic model.Table IIKB determined by quantitative DNase I footprinting analysisConditionsTop strandBottom strandRegionK BRegionK B× 10 m× 10 mA.KGlu (200 mm, 19 °C)+12 to −107.2 (1.3)+14 to −126.6 (1.1)−11 to −266.6 (1.1)−13 to −209.9 (1.2)−32 to −388.8 (0.60)−21 to −328.0 (1.2)+12 to −387.7 (1.1)+14 to −327.0 (0.83)B.KCl (100 mm, 19 °C)+12 to −381.49 (0.16)+14 to −371.39 (0.17)KGlu (200 mm, 4 °C)+12 to −3714.4 (0.98)Not determinedThe K B for each region was calculated using the double reciprocal plot of fractional protection of each regionversus RNA polymerase concentration as shown in Fig. 4.

(b) The footprinting was carried out under the reaction conditions specified. KGlu, potassium glutamate. The footprint observed at a single RNA polymerase concentration is not sufficient to determine the protection pattern of the fully formed closed complex. This is because the closed complex will not reach full occupancy at lower RNA polymerase concentrations (e.g. Fig. 1), while at higher RNA polymerase concentrations, where full occupancy can theoretically be achieved, nonspecific protection becomes significant and the specific protection pattern of the closed complex becomes obscured. Therefore, we have determined the protection pattern by carrying out quantitative footprinting analysis at varying RNA polymerase concentrations as described above. The double-reciprocal plots of fractional protection versusRNA polymerase concentration, which was also used to determine the binding constant as described above, was used to determined the maximum fractional protection, i.e. the fractional protection expected at saturating RNA polymerase concentration, at each position. The quantification was carried out for each individual band whenever possible, but for the bands that were too close to each other, or too weak to be quantified alone, they were quantified as small groups. Fig. 4 B shows several examples of the double-reciprocal plots from the top strand. The binding constants calculated from these plots as well as most other protected bands in the promoter region are similar to each other and to the binding constant determined for the entire regions described above. This demonstrates that the protection of these bands corresponds to the binding of a single RNA polymerase. In contrast, the intercepts of the different plots and consequently the maximum fractional protections calculated are different. The protection pattern of the closed complex derived from the maximum fractional protection at different positions in the promoter region is shown in Fig. 5 (C and D). Besides the protection pattern of the closed complex, we have also determined, using densitometry scanning, the protection pattern of the open complex, which is shown in Fig. 5 (A and B). A comparison of these two protection patterns have revealed major differences. First, the length of the overall protected region in the closed complex is about 20 base pairs shorter than that of the open complex. In the open complex, the protected region extends from −52 to +20 on the top strand, and from −56 to +21 on the bottom strand. In the closed complex, the protected region extends from about −45 to around +10. The downstream boundaries on both strands are between +10 and +16; the exact position is not certain because the maximum fractional protection determined for the positions from +11 to +15 was less precise due to weak DNase I cleavage at these positions. The upstream boundary on the bottom strand is at −43, as judged by the fact that none of the positions beyond was protected by more than 30%, which is less than half of the average fractional protection in the major protected region. For a similar reason, the upstream boundary on the top strand is around −46. The histogram in Fig. 5 D also shows that there was significant protection upstream from −51 on the top strand (dashed line in the figure). However, we found that this protection originated from binding of RNA polymerase at the overhanging end. This protection displays different RNA polymerase concentration dependence compared with those observed in the promoter region, and has a binding constant of 2.5 × 108m−1, which is more than 2 times larger than that of the closed complex. Moreover, this protection was completely abolished after the overhanging end was blunted by a nucleotide filling-in reaction using the Klenow fragment. The second major difference between the protection patterns of the closed and the open complexes is found around and upstream from the −35 region. In general, the protection in this region was much more extensive in the open complex. We refer to the positions with protection less than 30% as DNase I accessible sites. In Fig. 6, these accessible sites were projected onto a planar representation of a cylindrical B-form DNA model. As shown in the figure, about half of the positions between −30 to −42 (i.e. −30 to −33, and −38 to −41 on the top strand, and −34 and −35 on the bottom strand) are accessible to DNase I in the closed complex, but only one of them (−34 on the top strand) is accessible in the open complex; in the region from −43 to −53, all the positions are accessible to DNase I in the closed complex, but only about half of them are accessible in the open complex. Interestingly, position −34 on the top strand was protected in the closed complex twice as high as in the open complex (Fig. 5), and is considered to be accessible in the open complex but not in closed complex (Fig. 6). This difference was confirmed by a study of the changes in protection patterns during open complex formation (see below). Based on crystal structure, DNase I needs to contact up to six phosphate groups on substrate DNA for each cleavage (24Suck D. Oefner C. Nature. 1988; 332: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In other words, each DNase I-accessible site in the DNase I footprint actually represents a cluster of six phosphate groups that is not in contact with RNA polymerase. Based on this reasoning, we have derived the potential RNA polymer"
https://openalex.org/W1980663836,"Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis have been used to probe the flexibility of α-helix 2 (residues 35–46) in the apo structure of the human glutathione transferase P1-1 (EC 2.5.1.18) as well as in the binary complex with the natural substrate glutathione. Trp-38, which resides on helix 2, has been exploited as an intrinsic fluorescent probe of the dynamics of this region. A Trp-28 mutant enzyme was studied in which the second tryptophan of glutathione transferase P1-1 is replaced by histidine. Time-resolved fluorescence data indicate that, in the absence of glutathione, the apoenzyme exists in at least two different families of conformational states. The first one (38% of the total population) corresponds to a number of slightly different conformations of helix 2, in which Trp-38 resides in a polar environment showing an average emission wavelength of 350 nm. The second one (62% of the total population) displays an emission centered at 320 nm, thus suggesting a quite apolar environment near Trp-38. The interconversion between these two conformations is much slower than 1 ns. In the presence of saturating glutathione concentrations, the equilibrium is shifted toward the apolar component, which is now 83% of the total population. The polar conformers, on the other hand, do not change their average decay lifetime, but the distribution becomes wider, indicating a slightly increased rigidity. These data suggest a central role of conformational transitions in the binding mechanism, and are consistent with NMR data (Nicotra, M., Paci, M., Sette, M., Oakley, A. J., Parker, M.

Cytosolic glutathione transferases (GSTs; EC2.5.1.18)1 are a family of dimeric isoenzymes which catalyze the addition of the natural tripeptide glutathione (GSH) to a variety of organic compounds which contain an electrophilic center (1Jakoby W.B. Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. Enzymatic Basis of Detoxification. 2. Academic Press, New York1980: 63-94Google Scholar), so they have a crucial role in the cellular catabolism and transport of toxic organic compounds (2Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). They are grouped into at least five isoenzyme classes (Alpha, Mu, Pi, Theta, and Sigma) which have a similar molecular mass (46–48 kDa) but different amino acid sequence and substrate specificity (3Mannervik B. Alin P. Guthenberg C. Jensson H. Tahir M.K. Warholm M. Jörnvall H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7202-7206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar, 4Meyer D.J. Coles B. Pemble S.E.

An important contribution to the characterization of these isoenzymes is due to the definition of the three-dimensional structure of representative isoenzymes, obtained by x-ray crystallography (7Sinning I. Kleywegt G.J. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Olin B. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5317-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Despite the low homology of amino acid sequence for GSTs belonging to different classes, all GST isoenzymes show very similar tertiary and quaternary structures and quite identical GSH-binding sites (G-site) (13Armstrong R.N. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. Sect. A. 1994; 10: 1-44Google Scholar). Crystallographic data provide details about enzyme-substrate interactions and catalysis. In fact, some snapshots are available which define the apoenzyme structure, the enzyme-GSH complex, the enzyme-product complex, and also the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme in complex with a transition-state analogue (14Ji X. Armstrong R.N. Gilliland G.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12949-12954Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a number of unclarified questions about the catalytic mechanism (i.e. the controversial occurrence of an induced fit mechanism and the unexplained mechanism of GSH ionization at the active site) suggest that these “static” pictures are not sufficient to compose a movie which reveals all details of the binding and catalytic events. Investigations about the dynamics of GSTs may provide the explanatory key for many unsolved questions and, in this context, the human GST P1-1 appears an interesting model. In fact, several pieces of evidence suggest that conformational motions of this enzyme have a crucial role both in the binding of substrates and in the catalytic mechanism. More precisely, the flexibility of helix 2 seems to modulate the G-site affinity for GSH (15Ricci G. Caccuri A.M. Lo Bello M. Rosato N. Mei G. Nicotra M. Chiessi E. Mazzetti A.P. Federici G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16187-16192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); helix 4 motions are possibly involved more directly in the catalytic event which is rate-limited by a structural transition of the ternary complex (16Caccuri A.M. Ascenzi P. Antonini G. Parker M.W. Oakley A.J. Chiessi E. Nuccetelli M. Battistoni A. Bellizia A. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16193-16198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this paper we focus on the dynamics of helix 2 by means of time-resolved fluorescence to probe its relevance in the GSH-binding step. The irregular α-helix 2 (residues 35–46) displays the highest thermal factors of domain 1 and Trp-38 and Lys-44, which reside in this protein segment, are involved in the GSH binding by hydrogen bond interactions (10Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R. Huber R. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Parker M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Its high flexibility is also suggested by a number of observations including the facile disulfide bond formation between Cys-47 and Cys-101, which appear about 18 Å apart in the crystal structure (17Ricci G. Del Boccio G. Pennelli A. Lo Bello M. Petruzzelli R. Caccuri A.M. Barra D. Federici G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover helix 2 moves about 4 Å away from helix 4 when GSH binds to the G-site (15Ricci G. Caccuri A.M. Lo Bello M. Rosato N. Mei G. Nicotra M. Chiessi E. Mazzetti A.P. Federici G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16187-16192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mutation of Cys-47, which resides at the end of helix 2 and probably modulates its flexibility by an electrostatic interaction with Lys-54, causes an increased mobility of this loop, a lowered affinity for GSH, and strong positive cooperativity toward GSH (18Ricci G. Lo Bello M. Caccuri A.M. Pastore A. Nuccetelli M. Parker M.W. Federici G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1243-1248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Lo Bello M.

Similar kinetic changes were recently observed by replacing Gly-41, a possible joint residue for this helix, thus confirming that any critical point mutation perturbing the flexibility on this helix may be crucial for the binding process and for the intersubunit structural communication. 2M. Lo Bello, M. Nuccetelli, E. Chiessi, A. Lahm, A. P. Mazzetti, A. Battistoni, A. M. Caccuri, A. J. Oakley, M. W. Parker, A. Tramontano, and G. Ricci, manuscript in preparation.2M. Lo Bello, M. Nuccetelli, E. Chiessi, A. Lahm, A. P. Mazzetti, A. Battistoni, A. M. Caccuri, A. J. Oakley, M. W. Parker, A. Tramontano, and G. Ricci, manuscript in preparation. Recent data also suggest that the segmental motions involving helix 2 are fast enough to be strongly modulated by the viscosity of the solution (15Ricci G. Caccuri A.M. Lo Bello M. Rosato N. Mei G. Nicotra M. Chiessi E. Mazzetti A.P. Federici G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16187-16192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, no data are available for a more precise time scale in which these motions occur as well as for the trajectory of this segment and the thermodynamic parameters which define this flexibility. Another important question is how the movements of this segment have an active role in modulating the interaction of the enzyme with the substrate. A method currently used to monitor the dynamics of proteins is time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. The versatility of this approach to investigate the motions of protein segments is well documented (20Eftink M.R. Methods of Biochemical Analysis. 1991; 35: 127-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and arises from its intrinsic “kinetic” character. The fluorescence properties of the protein tryptophans are modulated by a number of interactions with the protein environment and with the solvent which occur only in the lifetime of their excited state (about 1 ns). So, fast conformational transitions which occur in or below this time frame and which also involve tryptophan residues can be revealed and studied. Furthermore, the existence of different conformations that interconvert in times slower than the fluorescence lifetime results in a non-exponential intensity decay, and thus can be detected. Recently, time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy has been applied to study glutathione S-transferase A1-1 from rat (21Wang R.W. Bird A.W. Newton D.J. Lu A.Y.H. Atkins W.M. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2085-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar); since this isoenzyme has a single Trp per subunit, located in the H-site, the intrinsic fluorescence was used to characterize the dynamics of that region. Another fluorescence study focused on the protonation state of Tyr-7 of the same isoenzyme (22Dietze E.C. Wang R.W. Lu A.Y.H. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6745-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the case of GST P1-1, two tryptophans are located in each monomer, Trp-28 and Trp-38. The latter is a good intrinsic probe for helix 2 transitions as it resides on this segment and interacts directly with the bound substrate (Fig. 1). By site-directed mutagenesis we expressed the enzyme with Trp-28 replaced by histidine. The mutated enzyme shows kinetic properties and a structure very similar to the native enzyme, so it is a useful model for the present investigation. Mutants of human GST P1-1 were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis, carried out according to a previously described procedure (19Lo Bello M. Battistoni A. Mazzetti A.P. Board P.G. Muramatsu M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1249-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The single-stranded DNA template was generated using plasmid p18seq-1, which contains the full-length nucleotide sequence encoding for GST P1-1 in plasmid pEMBL18 (19Lo Bello M. Battistoni A. Mazzetti A.P. Board P.G. Muramatsu M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1249-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotide was used as mutagenic primer for W28H: 5′-TCCTCCTTGTGGCTCTGGC. The nucleotide sequence of this mutant was checked by the dideoxy chain termination method. The mutated 780 base pairs SphI-SphI DNA fragments from plasmid p18seq-1 were subcloned under control of trc promoter in expression plasmids expressing large amounts of recombinant enzyme in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli cells (23Battistoni A. Mazzetti A.P. Petruzzelli R. Muramatsu M. Federici G. Ricci G. Lo Bello M. Protein Express. Purif. 1995; 6: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). GST P1-1 and W28H mutant were purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized glutathione (24Simons P. Vander Jagt D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Kinetic parametersk cat and K m were determined by using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as co-substrate in 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, as described previously (15Ricci G. Caccuri A.M. Lo Bello M. Rosato N. Mei G. Nicotra M. Chiessi E. Mazzetti A.P. Federici G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16187-16192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Steady state fluorescence measurements were performed on a SPEX FluoroMax photon counting spectrofluorometer (SPEX Industries Inc., Edison, NJ), at 20 °C, with a 4-nm band pass for both excitation and emission. Spectra were corrected for background signal, which was always <1% of the total intensity. For time-resolved fluorescence measurements, a frequency domain ISS fluorometer (ISS Inc., Champaign, IL) was used. Excitation at 295 nm was provided by a cavity-dumped, externally frequency doubled rhodamine 6G dye-laser (model 700, Coherent), synchronously pumped by a mode-locked Nd-YAG laser (Antares model, Coherent, Palo Alto, CA). The absorbance of the samples at 295 nm was about 0.1–0.2. The enzyme sample was in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.1 mm EDTA. Emission was collected through a WG320 filter (Corion) to remove any scatter light. In the wavelength-dependent lifetime measurements, instead, an emission monochromator (Jobin Yvon Y10, 4-nm band pass) was used. Phase-modulation lifetime measurements were carried out at 12 frequencies from 7 to 200 MHz. Color errors due to photomultiplier response were minimized by the use of reference standard solutions of p-terphenyl (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) in ethanol (lifetime = 1.05 ns). All lifetimes measurements were carried out at “magic angle” configuration. The sample holder was thermostated and was kept at 20 °C, unless where it is otherwise specified. Phase-modulation data were analyzed with the Globals Unlimited software (25Beechem J.M. Gratton E. Ameloot M. Knutson J.R. Brand L. Lakowicz J.R. Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy.2. Plenum Press, New York1991: 241-305Google Scholar), with different models, including one, two, or three exponential lifetimes, or continuous lifetime distributions of different shapes (see “Results”). Goodness of fit was assessed by the value of minimized χ2, which was calculated using standard deviations of ± 0.2° and ± 0.004 for phase angles and modulation ratios, respectively. Rigorous χ2-surface error analysis was performed to evaluate uncertainties of recovered fit parameters (26Beechem J.M. Gratton E. Proc. SPIE Int. Soc. Opt. Eng. 1988; 909: 70-81Google Scholar). Statistical evaluation and comparison between the different decay models was carried out using the Schwarz criterion (27Landaw E.M. Di Stefano J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: R665-R667PubMed Google Scholar). W28H mutant shows kinetic parameters very similar to those of the native enzyme. At 25 °C and in the presence of 1 mm1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as co-substrate (in 0.1 mpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5), it has an apparentk cat = 36 ± 3 s−1 (38 ± 4 s−1 for wild type) and a K m value for GSH of 0.20 ± 0.02 mm (0.15 ± 0.01 mm for wild type). Far UV circular dichroism spectrum of the mutant (not shown) overlaps that of the native enzyme, suggesting that mutation does not cause any remarkable change in the structure of the enzyme. Fig. 2 shows the fluorescence emission spectra (excitation 295 nm) of WT and W28H GST together with that of the reference compound N-acetyl-tryptophan-amide (NATA). The 295-nm excitation wavelength excites selectively the Trp residues. For samples of the same protein concentration (0.1 mg/ml) the total fluorescence intensity of W28H is only 0.30 that of the wild type enzyme; therefore, if the W28H mutation does not change appreciably the quantum yield of Trp-38, the relative contributions of Trp-28 and Trp-38 to the overall fluorescence of wild type GST P1-1 are approximately 70 and 30%, respectively. The quantum yield of Trp-38 in the mutant, relative to NATA, is 0.30 ± 0.01, as determined by the ratio of the respective fluorescence intensities, integrated between 300 and 450 nm, for samples of the same tryptophan concentration (A 295 ≪ 0.1) and of the same buffer composition. Phase-shift and demodulation data relative to the fluorescence intensity decay of W28H at 20 °C are shown in Fig. 3. Data are analyzed with several decay models (Table I): single, double, and triple lifetime, continuous distributions of lifetimes, with Gaussian, uniform and Lorentzian shape, as well as the combination of a “discrete” lifetime with a continuous distribution and a double continuous distribution.Table IFits to different models of the W28H fluorescence intensity decay (T = 20 °C, pH 6.5, λexc = 295 nm)Nparχ2SCSingle exponential τ 1.1014209760Double exponential τ1 2.66; α1 0.15; τ20.5736.0136Triple exponential τ14.74; α1 0.03; τ2 1.49; α2 0.28; τ3 0.3651.035.5Single Lorentzian distribution c 0.92; w 1.4127.3168Lorentzian distribution and exponential c 1.70; w 1.08; αLor 0.38; τ 0.4240.7227.2Double Lorentzian distribution c1 1.69; w1 1.08; α1 0.36; c20.42; w2 0.00550.7630.4For equations used in the fits see Ref. 30Alcala J.R.

The single- and double-exponential models, as well as a single continuous distribution do not give an adequate fit of the decay of the W28H mutant (as evident from the high χ2 values). Judging from the χ2 values, the best fit is obtained with a single-exponential plus a continuous Lorentzian distribution of lifetimes. Furthermore, this model has only 4 free parameters, compared with the 5 of the triple exponential and double Lorentzian models, that also achieve good χ2 values. The superiority of the “Lorentzian plus exponential” model is quantified by the Schwarz criterion (27Landaw E.M. Di Stefano J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: R665-R667PubMed Google Scholar), which calculates a parameter that takes into account both the accuracy of the fit and the number of parameters utilized, and thus compares “non-nested” models with a different number of parameters. Again, the model with an exponential and a distribution gives the best value for this parameter. Finally, the double distribution model gives a near zero width of the distribution centered at a shorter time (0.005 is a lower limit imposed by the fitting program), making this model equivalent to the Lorentzian plus exponential one. Thus a good description of the fluorescence intensity decay of Trp-38 is given by a Lorentzian distribution of lifetimes, centered at 1.7 ± 0.1 ns, with a width of 1.0 ± 0.05 ns, plus a discrete lifetime (τ = 0.42 ± 0.03 ns). The molar fractions associated with the two components are 0.38 ± 0.03 and 0.62 ± 0.03, respectively. A control measurement of the fluorescence decay of NATA, performed under identical conditions, is accurately described by a single-exponential fit (χ2 = 1.1), with a value of 2.9 ± 0.1 ns, in agreement with literature values (28Bismuto E. Irace G. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 50: 165-168Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This rules out the possibility that the heterogeneity in the fluorescence decay of W28H mutant results from instrumental response, and suggests that the heterogeneity arises from interaction of the tryptophan residue with the protein matrix. Comparison of the NATA fluorescence lifetime with the average lifetime obtained from the best fit of W28H fluorescence decay (0.83 ± 0.07 ns) gives a ratio of 0.29 ± 0.03 in perfect agreement with the ratio of steady state intensities. This is a further indication that the model used to describe the fluorescence decay is correct, and also shows that quenching of Trp-38 is only due to dynamic factors. Even though it is impossible to associate a confidence probability to our model choice, since the so called “F test” can be applied only to “nested models” (27Landaw E.M. Di Stefano J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: R665-R667PubMed Google Scholar), a strong support to our hypothesis comes from a global analysis of all the time-resolved data collected. As described in the following sections, the fluorescence time decay of W28H GST P1-1 has been measured under various conditions, varying the temperature or the concentration of glutathione in solution. In all the experiments performed the Lorentzian plus exponential model gave the best fit, as judged both by the reduced χ2 and by the Schwarz criterium. Furthermore, as shown below, the parameters recovered using this model follow a specific trend with temperature or substrate concentration. On the other hand, when a triple exponential model was used, the parameters varied in an unpredictable, random way with the macroscopic variables. Therefore, the triple exponential fit does not have any physical meaning, even though it could describe the experimental data with reasonable values of χ2. The fluorescence intensity time decay of W28H is studied as a function of temperature from 5 to 20 °C. Experiments at higher temperature are not carried out; even at 30 °C a small decrease of enzymatic activity is observed during the measurement time (about 30 min), possibly due to the enzyme exposure to laser excitation. The Lorentzian plus exponential model gives the best fit at all temperatures studied. The molar fractions of the two components are unchanged, while the two lifetimes are quenched, as a direct effect of the temperature increase (Table II). The width of the Lorentzian distribution increases with decreasing temperature, while the other component can be adequately described by a discrete lifetime at all the temperatures studied.Table IIW28H GST fluorescence intensity decay parameters as a function of temperature (pH 6.5, λexc = 295 nm)TcwαLorτχ2°Cnsns201.71.10.380.420.73102.01.30.370.591.152.31.70.370.631.9For parameters definitions and errors see Table I. The model with a Lorentzian distribution plus a discrete component gives the best fit under all conditions. Open table in a new tab For parameters definitions and errors see Table I. The model with a Lorentzian distribution plus a discrete component gives the best fit under all conditions. The fluorescence intensity decay of the two components is also studied as a function of emission wavelength, from 305 to 365 nm, exciting at 295 nm. These wavelength dependent measurements can be used to determine the fluorescence spectra of individual lifetime components. The ideal situation for this kind of analysis is when one can distinguish experimentally a different decay lifetime for each conformer. In that case, one can assume that each lifetime has the same value at all the wavelengths studied (neglecting solvent relaxation problems); the only varying parameters are the fluorescence fractions associated to the lifetimes, that allow a reconstruction of the decay-associated spectra. Unfortunately, this approach cannot be applied in our case: if we assume that the parameters of the Lorentzian distribution and of the discrete lifetime are the same at all the wavelengths, the fit gives parameters comparable to those obtained without the monochromator but the χ2 values are rather high (Table III, part A). This is due to the fact that the above procedure is not correct for the lifetime distribution. The lifetimes of the conformers that constitute this component are so similar (and so many) that it is impossible to distinguish experimentally every one of them; we can only describe them collectively (as a distribution). However, each conformer has, in principle, a (slightly) different emission spectrum. As a consequence, the fraction of total fluorescence that can be associated to a given lifetime value within the lifetime distribution is a function of wavelength: the lifetime distribution shape varies with emission wavelength and cannot be assumed constant.Table IIIW28H GST fluorescence intensity decay parameters, as a function of emission wavelength (T = 20 °C, pH 6.5, λexc = 295 nm)Aλfτχ2nm3050.64113150.457.93250.341.13350.30203500.16133650.1431Bλfτχ2nm3050.591.73150.320.343250.290.323350.210.893500.102.63650.0010A), fit with a Lorentzian distribution plus a discrete component, with the parameters c, w, and τ linked.

A partially purified preparation of phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase from bovine pancreas was used to generate a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies. The anti-phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase monoclonal antibody UC1 was coupled to a solid support and used to immunopurify the bovine liver enzyme 670,000-fold in two steps to apparent homogeneity with an overall yield of 14%. The purified phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase has a specific activity of 498 μmol of [3H]GlcNAc-α-phosphomannose-α-methyl cleaved per h per mg of protein using 0.5 mm[3H]GlcNAc-α-phosphomannose-α-methyl as substrate. The subunit structure of the enzyme was determined using a combination of analytical gel filtration chromatography, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and amino-terminal sequencing. The data indicate that bovine phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase is a 272,000-Da complex of four identical 68,000-Da glycoprotein subunits arranged as two disulfide-linked homodimers. A soluble form of the enzyme, isolated from fetal bovine serum, showed the same subunit structure. Both forms of the enzyme reacted with a rabbit antibody raised to the amino-terminal peptide of the liver enzyme, suggesting that phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase is a type I membrane-spanning glycoprotein with its amino terminus in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus."

To date, no ligand for human CD48 has been characterized. In this study, we show that human recombinant CD48 binds to the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate on the surface of human epithelial cells. We have produced a monoclonal antibody (615) against epithelial cell surfaces that blocks this binding and show that it too recognizes heparan sulfate.

CD48 is a cell surface molecule that is expressed by B lymphocytes and other hematopoietic cells. Its expression is up-regulated in response to activation signals (1Yokoyama S. Staunton D. Fisher R. Amiot M. Fortin J.J. Thorley-Lawson D.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2192-2200PubMed Google Scholar). CD48 is a 40–45-kDa glycoprotein member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which is composed of a single polypeptide chain that has a high degree of homology to CD58 (LFA-3) and to a lesser extent CD2, the CD58 ligand. Despite intensive efforts, no ligand for human CD48 has been found, although it is now known to replace CD58 as the ligand for CD2 in rodents, which lack CD58 (2Kato K. Koyanagi M. Okada H.

It has been reported that CD48 is an alternate ligand for CD2 in humans (6Sandrin M.S. Mouhtouris E. Vaughan H.A. Warren H.S. Parish C.R. J.

Med. 1993; 177: 1439-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); however, this was not confirmed by surface plasmon resonance studies, which failed to detect binding of human CD48 to CD2 (K < 0.5 mm). We have recently presented evidence that there is a ligand for human CD48 on epithelial cells (8Ianelli C.J. Edson C.M. Thorley-Lawson D.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3910-3920PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we show that recombinant CD48 binds to the glycosaminoglycan (GAG)1heparan sulfate, which is expressed on epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. CD48 expression is up-regulated when B cells are driven by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection to become activated, proliferating lymphoblasts (9Thorley-Lawson D.A. Schooley R.T. Bhan A.K. Nadler L.M. Cell. 1982; 30: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Klaman L.D. Thorley-Lawson D.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 871-881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and an EBV-responsive element has recently been mapped within the upstream region of the CD48 gene (10Klaman L.D. Thorley-Lawson D.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 871-881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison, we have shown that EBV-infected cells in the peripheral blood are all resting cells (11Miyashita E.M. Yang B. Babcock G. Thorley-Lawson D.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4882-4891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesize that EBV specifically up-regulates CD48 expression on lymphoblastoid B cells in order to cause them to be preferentially retained in the mucosal epithelium through the interaction of CD48 with heparan sulfate, thus explaining the absence of infected lymphoblasts from the peripheral blood. ER and JY are EBV-immortalized B lymphoblastoid cell lines and were derived in this laboratory. Jurkat, Molt4, Hl-60, and HeLa were obtained from the ATCC. tsA201 was a kind gift from Dr. Brian Seed. Wild type CHO K1 cells and the mutant derivatives pgsA-745, pgsB-650, pgsD-677, and pgsE-606 were kindly supplied by Dr. Jeff Esko and have been characterized in detail elsewhere (12Esko J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Lymphoid and HeLa S3 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. The remaining epithelial cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium (3:1) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 1.1 μm hydrocortisone, 1.64 μm epidermal growth factor, 5.5 μm epinephrine, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 2 nm triiodothyronine, 18 mm adenine. Adherent cells were removed for analysis using 0.5 mm EDTA/PBS. HeLa S3 cells were grown in suspension in spinner flasks (Bellco). The monoclonal antibodies used in this work, CJI250, 451, and 615, were produced as follows. Female Balb/cAnN mice (Charles River Laboratories), 8–10 weeks old, were immunized intraperitoneally with whole live HeLa S3 cells (2 × 107 cells) on days 1, 31, and 73 and with a crudely purified membrane preparation from 1.25 × 108 Hela S3 cells on days 253 and 275, all without adjuvant. Five days after the final injection, splenocytes were fused to the non-secreting mouse myeloma cell line X63-Ag8.653. Hybridoma supernatants were screened for antibodies capable of blocking the binding of HeLa S3 cells to immobilized sCD48 (see below). The antibodies were purified from ascites fluid using immobilized protein L (Kappalock, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and concentrated to 4 mg/ml by spin filtration using a Centriprep-30 concentrator (Amicon). Purified antibodies were conjugated by standard methods to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) for direct staining or biotin for indirect staining. FITC-conjugated secondary reagents to detect primary antibodies were: FITC-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of rabbit anti-human μ chain (Dako), FITC-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse Ig (Dako), FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig (Dako), and FITC-conjugated streptavidin (Dako). Analysis was performed on a FACScan® flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson). The cDNA 2A1.sec, encoding a novel secreted form of human CD48, was generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis as described previously (13Thorley-Lawson D.A. Ianelli C. Klaman L.D. Staunton D. Yokoyama S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 14Staunton D.E. Thorley-Lawson D.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3695-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cDNA 2A1.sec was excised from the CDM8 vector by digestion withXbaI and the resulting 0.9-kilobase fragment was inserted into the unique XbaI site of the eukaryotic glutamine synthetase (GS) expression vector pEE14 (Celltech) to create pEE2A1.sec. The GS gene on the plasmid confers resistance to the GS inhibitor methionine sulfoximine and was used as a selection marker. Exponentially growing monolayers of CHO K1 cells (1 × 107) were transfected with 25–30 μg of pEE2A1.sec DNA, previously linearized with Drd-1, using the ProFection®calcium phosphate transfection system (Promega). Following transfection, CHO K1 monolayers were “glycerol-shocked” for 2 min using 15% (v/v) glycerol/HBSS and returned to culture. Thirty-six hours following transfection, cells were harvested and transferred to 96-well plates at 5 × 103 cells/well in medium containing methionine sulfoximine at a final concentration of 25 μm. After 14 days, supernatants from wells containing growing colonies were harvested and screened for the presence of sCD48 protein by sandwich ELISA. To induce amplification of the plasmid, cells were incubated in 1–100 μm methionine sulfoximine. Cells producing the highest levels of sCD48 were retained, and large amounts of sCD48 protein were generated by bulk culture of these cells. Upon culture exhaustion, supernatants were harvested and supplemented with protease inhibitors: AEBSF (100 μm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (500 μm), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), and EDTA (1 mm). sCD48 was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using mAb 6.28 immobilized on Affi-Gel-10. Purified sCD48 was concentrated to 1 mg/ml by spin filtration using a Centriprep-10 concentrator (Amicon) and stored in aliquots at – 70 °C until use. Purified sCD48 was diluted in 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, 25 mm Tris-Cl pH 8.0, dispensed into the wells of 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates (Linbro) at 75 μl/well and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. Following immobilization, wells were filled with 0.1% (w/v) BSA/HBSS, pH 7.4, and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C to block unbound sites. Coated, blocked wells were washed three times each with 200 μl of 10% FCS/HBSS, pH 7.4 (binding buffer), and then filled with binding buffer and kept at 4 °C until use. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold HBSS and resuspended in 50 μg/ml calcein-AM (Molecular Probes)/HBSS at ∼1 × 107 cells/ml and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in total darkness to label the cells. Following this, labeled cells were washed twice and resuspended in the same buffer at 1 × 106cells/ml for loading into coated wells. 1 × 105labeled cells, in a volume of 100 μl, were loaded into each well and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C. Following this incubation, unbound cells were removed by inverting the plates and allowing them to float for 60 min in tanks of ice-cold 1% (v/v) FCS, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, PBS, pH 7.4. After 60 min, the intensity of fluorescence remaining in the well was measured using the CytoFluor 2300 system (Millipore). The wells of 96-well flat bottom plates (Linbro) were treated with a solution of 1% glutaraldehyde for 5 min and washed three times with PBS, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. Immediately following the removal of glutaraldehyde, the wells were coated for 2 h at 25 °C with 100 μl of serially diluted GAGs (heparin (Sigma), chondroitin sulfate C (Sigma), and hyaluronic acid (Sigma)) in PBS or PBS alone. Following coating, wells were filled with blocking buffer, consisting of 0.25% (w/v) BSA/PBS, pH 7.4, incubated for 2 h and then washed three times with blocking buffer. Culture supernatants containing either mAb 615 or mAb 1117 were added to each well, and wells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Following incubation, the wells were washed three times with blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig (Dako). Wells were again washed three times with blocking buffer, and 100 μl of substrate solution, consisting of 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma), 0.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mmNa2CO3, pH 9.6, were dispensed into each well. Wells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and color development was stopped by the addition of 25–50 μl of 1n NaOH to each well. The absorbance of each reacted well was measured at 405 nm using a DynaTek MR700 ELISA plate reader. Briefly, HeLa S3 cells were harvested from culture and washed twice with ice-cold HBSS by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Approximately 1.6 × 107 washed cells were resuspended in 4 ml of reaction buffer alone or reaction buffer containing one of the following GAG-degrading enzymes: chondroitinase ABC (1.25 units/ml, EC 4.2.2.4, Sigma), hyaluronidase (25 units/ml, EC 3.2.1.35, Calbiochem), keratanase (1.8 units/ml, EC 3.2.1.103, Sigma), heparin lyase I (3.125 units/ml, EC 4.2.2.7, Sigma), heparin lyase II (3.125 units/ml, Sigma), and heparin lyase III (2.5 units/ml, EC 4.2.2.8, Sigma). Reaction buffer consisted of 1% (w/v) BSA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 100 μm AEBSF/PBS, pH 7.4. Cells were incubated with enzyme for 60 min at 35 °C with occasional agitation. Following this incubation, cells were washed three times with 2.5% (v/v) FCS, 0.025% (w/v) NaN3, HBSS by centrifugation and stained with antibodies for FACS® analysis as described above. To monitor the efficacy of each enzyme, the above digestions were performed in parallel using radiolabeled HeLa S3 cells. For labeling of GAGs, cultures of HeLa S3 cells were established in complete SO4/glucose-deficient RPMI growth medium supplemented withd-[6-3H]glucosamine hydrochloride (40 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) and Na35SO4(563 mCi/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) and incubated for 48 h. Following digestion, the cells were pelleted and supernatants were collected for scintillation counting with HydroFluor scintillation fluid (National Diagnostics) and an LKB RackBeta scintillation counter. Deparaffinated sections of human small intestine, fixed previously in 2% paraformaldehyde, were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C with either mAb 615 or 1117 (culture supernatants) and then rinsed in HBSS containing 1% BSA (w/v) for 10 min. Specific staining was detected using biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin and peroxidase conjugated avidin-biotin complexes (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as directed by the vendor. Visualization of stained sections was accomplished using 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (w/v) and 0.01% hydrogen peroxide (w/v). Prior to antibody staining in some experiments, deparaffinated sections were first treated with either heparin lyase III (2.5 units/ml, EC 4.2.2.8) or chondroitinase ABC (1.25 units/ml, EC 4.2.2.4) for 30 min at 25 °C followed by three rinses in HBSS containing 1% BSA (w/v) for 5 min each. Reaction buffer for both enzyme digestions consisted of 1% (w/v) BSA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 100 μm AEBSF/PBS, pH 7.4. We have screened a large panel of cell lines for their ability to bind sCD48 immobilized on plastic dishes. A representative set of binding results for the most informative human cell lines is shown in Fig. 1 A. Of all the cell lines tested only, epithelial cells bound consistently and avidly as exemplified by the HeLa S3 and tsA201 cells. Not shown is that epithelial cell lines from other species including monkeys and rodents bound equally well as the human lines. We produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies against the surface of HeLaS3 cells and used the binding assay to test for their ability to block the interaction between epithelial cells and CD48. Three mAbs, CJI250, 451, and 615, were derived that bind to the surface of epithelial cells and proved useful for further study. All three antibodies recognize the same or overlapping epitopes as demonstrated by competitive RIA where each mAb specifically blocked the binding of the others. As shown in Fig. 2, all three antibodies specifically block the interaction of epithelial cells with CD48. The antibodies were then used to stain the panel of cell lines, tested in the binding assay, for expression of the putative CD48 ligand. FACS analysis for the same, most informative, human cell lines is shown in Fig. 1(B–H) adjacent to the results obtained with the same cell lines in binding assays. All three antibodies gave the same staining pattern so only the results for CJI250 are shown. Strong staining was observed for all epithelial cell lines tested irrespective of their tissue or species origin. In contrast, the antibodies bound weakly to human B cell lines, including EBV-transformed B cell lines, and did not stain any of the human T cell or myeloid lines tested with the exception of Jurkat which stained weakly. In sum, the FACS staining profiles obtained with the blocking antibodies on the complete panel of cell lines correlated precisely with the results of the adhesion assays (Fig. 1, A–H, and Table I).Figure 2Three monoclonal antibodies that block the binding of epithelial cells to sCD48.

Each assay was performed in the presence of undiluted culture supernatant from the isotype control antibody 1117 or one of the blocking IgM antibodies.

Furthermore, we noted that all three of the blocking monoclonal antibodies were of the IgM isotype, raising the possibility that the ligand may be carbohydrate in nature and therefore unable to elicit a secondary antibody response. As there is evidence suggesting that members of the immunoglobulin superfamily can interact with carbohydrate ligands, especially the complex carbohydrates referred to as GAGs, we decided to test for a possible role for GAGs in epithelial cell binding to CD48. To do this, we took advantage of the fact that there are available a number of mutant variants of the CHO epithelial cell line that are defective in various aspects of GAG synthesis. Each mutant cell line has been well characterized (12Esko J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and is described briefly in Table II. Mutants pgsA-745 and pgsB-650 are unable to add any GAGs to proteins because they lack the enzymes needed to synthesize the core proximal tetrasaccharide upon which the GAGs are synthesized. Mutant pgsD-677 fails specifically to synthesize heparan sulfate, and pgsE-606 is defective in the sulfation of GAGs.Table IICharacteristics of the CHO mutant cell lines used and their defects in glycosaminoglycan synthesisCHO strainBiochemical defectGlycosaminoglycan productionHeparan sulfateChondroitin sulfateK1-wtNoneYesYespgsA-745XylosyltransferaseNoNopgsB-650GalactosyltransferaseNoNopgsD-677N-Acetylglucosaminyl/glucuronosyltransferaseNoYes2-aChondroitin sulfate accumulates to levels 2–3 times higher than in wild-type cells.pgsE-606N-SulfotransferaseYes2-bHeparan sulfate is undersulfated by a factor of 2–3.Yes2-a Chondroitin sulfate accumulates to levels 2–3 times higher than in wild-type cells.2-b Heparan sulfate is undersulfated by a factor of 2–3. Open table in a new tab The wild type and mutant CHO cell lines were first examined by FACS® analysis after staining with the three blocking mAbs. Fig. 3 shows the result of staining wild type CHO K1 cells (gray histograms) in comparison to the various mutant cell lines (white histograms). mAbs CJI250, 451, and 615 all specifically stained wild type CHO K1 cells (Fig. 3), whereas an isotype-matched control mAb 1117 did not. None of the antibodies stained the mutant CHO lines pgsA-745 or pgsB-650, demonstrating that all three antibodies recognize a GAG or GAG-associated structure. In addition, the antibodies failed to stain the mutant line pgsD-677. The data from assays with CHO line pgsD-677 were most revealing, as these cells lack heparan sulfate, but tend to overexpress chondroitin sulfates by a factor of 2 -3, suggesting that the GAG recognized by the mAbs CJI250, 451, and 615 is heparan sulfate. When mutant pgsE-606 was examined by FACS®, the staining with mAbs 451 and CJI250 increased slightly, whereas that with mAb 615 decreased by about a factor of 5–10. This result suggested that the N-sulfation of heparan sulfate is most important for mAb 615 binding and that mAbs 451 and CJI250 recognize overlapping but distinct epitopes from 615. To directly demonstrate interaction of sCD48 with cell surface heparan sulfate, adhesion assays were performed using the various CHO cell mutants. The results of these assays are shown in Fig. 4. Only the wild type CHO K1 and CHO pgsE-606 bound significantly to immobilized sCD48, both at levels comparable to those seen with HeLa S3. Thus, the binding assay results are in agreement with the FACS analysis providing strong evidence that the antibodies recognize structural elements of GAGs that are directly involved in mediating the binding of epithelial cells to CD48. Furthermore, the FACS® and cell binding data with the CHO cell mutants suggest that the GAG involved in the binding of epithelial cells to CD48 is heparan sulfate. Well characterized mutant human epithelial cell lines that are defective in GAG production are not available. To confirm the role of GAGs in the binding of human epithelial cell lines to CD48 and more precisely define the nature of the GAG, we have employed digestion with GAG specific enzymes. Specifically, we looked at the ability of HeLa S3 cells to bind to CD48 before and after digestion with heparin lyase I, heparin lyase II, heparin lyase III, chondroitinase ABC, hyaluronidase, and keratanase. The specific structures cleaved by these enzymes are shown in Table III. For heparin lyases I, II, and III, the enzyme activity varies depending on the particular modifications present in the heparin/heparan sulfate chain. As shown in Table III, digestion with these enzymes can distinguish heparin from heparan sulfate, because lyase I preferentially digests heparin, whereas lyase III preferentially digests heparan sulfate. Each lyase removed the epitopes recognized by monoclonal antibodies CJI250, 451, and 615, with heparin lyase I being the least effective and heparin lyase III being the most effective (Fig. 5). Lyase III was so effective that staining could no longer be detected with mAbs CJI 250 and 451 and staining with CJI250 was reduced more than 10-fold. A protein epitope recognized by a control antibody BU75, specific for CD44, was not affected by treatment with these enzymes. Treatment of the Hela S3 cell surface with enzymes specific for the GAGs chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, and keratin sulfate did not affect staining with any of the antibodies (Fig. 5). For each assay, enzyme activity was confirmed by parallel digestion of cells metabolically labeled with [3H]glucosamine and measuring the release of radioactive sugar into the medium (data not shown).Table IIISpecificities of the GAG-degrading enzymes used in this studyEnzymeRelative activity towardHeparinHeparan sulfateChondroitin sulfates A–EHyaluronic acidKeratan sulfateHeparin lyase I++++000Heparin lyase II++++++000Heparin lyase III+++++000Chondroitinase ABC+/−0++++++0Hyaluronidase00++++++0Keratanase0000++++Data are taken from Refs 35Linhardt R.J.

We have also analyzed the ability of proteases to destroy the ligand structure on the surface of HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 6, staining of HeLa S3 cell with the blocking monoclonal antibodies could be drastically reduced upon digestion with trypsin. Taken together, the enzyme digestion data further support the idea that heparan sulfate is the ligand for CD48 on epithelial cells and suggest that protein is required for its presentation. An alternate interpretation to all of the studies presented above is that the ligand is not heparan sulfate, but instead a protein that associates with heparan sulfate. To exclude this possibility, we have attempted to directly demonstrate the binding of CJI250, 451, and 615 to GAGs either directly or by competitive inhibition assays. As shown in Fig. 7, heparin, heparan sulfate, and dextran sulfate each inhibited binding of mAb 615 to HeLa S3 cells, but had no effect on the binding of monoclonal antibodies CJI250 and 451. As expected, chondroitin sulfate C, hyaluronic acid, and dextran did not have any effect on the binding of mAb 615. The same results were obtained when the GAGs were used to directly block binding of HeLa S3 cells to sCD48 (Fig. 8). Only heparin, heparan sulfate, and dextran sulfate could block the binding. It was striking that in competition assays for mAb 615 or sCD48 binding to epithelial cells heparin was much more efficient than heparan sulfate. This suggests that the epitope structure recognized by CD48 and the blocking antibody 615 is much more densely present on the preparations of heparin we have used than on the heparan sulfate. This was confirmed in indirect ELISA assays where it was possible to demonstrate direct binding of mAb 615 to heparin. We were unable to detect direct binding to chondroitin sulfate C or hyaluronic acid (Fig. 9). Heparin is not present on the surface of epithelial cells. However, heparin and heparan sulfate are structurally the same, the only difference being that heparin tends to be more extensively modified through sulfation and epimerization. However, the modifications on each are heterogeneous; therefore, there is extensive structural overlap between the two. We conclude therefore that 615 specifically recognizes an epitope on epithelial cell-associated heparan sulfate that mediates the binding of sCD48 to epithelial cells. This structure is more abundant on the preparations of heparin that we have used than on the preparations of heparan sulfate. The data are inconclusive about the precise nature of the structures recognized by CJI250 and 451.Figure 8Competitive Inhibition of HeLa S3 binding to sCD48 with purified GAGs.

Since nicking and depurination are known to destabilize DNA helical structure, our observations indicate that the instability of the −10 region is important for open complex formation. We further infer that (i) the nucleation of DNA melting, which occurs during the isomerization from the closed complex into the open complex, contributes to the rate of open complex formation; (ii) the nucleation of melting occurs around the −10 region; and (iii) the propagation of DNA melting from the nucleation region is not rate-limiting. In addition, we have found that depurination at several positions inhibited open complex formation. We used dimethyl sulfate modification protection studies to show that most of the guanine bases that are among these positions are in contact with RNA polymerase in the open complex.

Open complex formation is the major rate-determining step in the process of transcription initiation with E. coli RNA polymerase (Eς70). Many of the previous studies have been based on a model containing two functional steps (1McClure W.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 171-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 2Record M.T.

Some studies have also suggested that the isomerization step in the two-step model can be further dissected into two discrete steps: the rate-limiting isomerization step per se and a DNA melting step (3Chen Y-F.

In this extended model, the DNA melting step is argued to be very rapid under normal transcription conditions, and consequently it is normally not rate-limiting. It has been suggested that the isomerization step involves a major conformational change in RNA polymerase, which is thought to be the cause for the nucleation of DNA melting (10Roe J.H. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 11deHaseth P.L. Zupancic M.L. Record M.T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3019-3025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that the −10 region of the promoters recognized by ς70 holoenzyme is thermodynamically less stable than average DNA. The conserved −10 hexamer sequence has a melting free energy that is close to the maximum (least stable) possible based on a calculation using the nearest-neighbor thermodynamic data of Breslaueret al. (12Breslauer K.J. Frank R. Blocker H. Marky L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3746-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). Therefore, as expected, Margalit et al. (13Margalit H. Shapiro B.A. Nussinov R. Owens J. Jernigan R.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5179-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have shown that 80% of the up and down mutations in the −10 region correlated qualitatively with the change in the melting free energy. A closer inspection showed that most of the mutations among the exceptions are located outside the −10 (hexamer) region, and consequently are not bona fide exceptions if only the melting free energy of the −10 region is important. There were several exceptions within the −10 region. However, in such cases it can be argued that the effect of the mutation on the specific contact between RNA polymerase and promoter DNA is larger than the effect of the melting free energy change, and consequently obscured this effect. We have tested whether the structural instability of the −10 region is important for promoter function (presumably in the nucleation of DNA melting) by carrying out depurination and prenicking studies. Both prenicking (14Pieters J.M.L. Mans R.M.W. van den Elst H. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Altona C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4551-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Erie D.A. Jones R.A. Olson W.K. Sinha N.K. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and depurination (16Millican T.A. Mock G.A. Chauncey M.A. Patel T.P. Eaton M.A.W. Gunning J. Cutbush S.D. Neidle S. Mann J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7435-7453Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 18Goljev I. Withka J.M. Kao J.Y. Bolton P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11614-11619Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) are known to destabilize DNA double-helical structure, and prenicking may also increase DNA structural flexibility (19Koudelka G.B. Harbury P. Harrison S.C. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4633-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We found that both defects at positions around the −10 region had strong stimulatory effect on the rate of open complex formation on the prmup-1Δ265 promoter. This suggests that DNA structural instability in the −10 region is important for promoter function, and that DNA melting contributes to the rate of open complex formation. Interestingly, the region displaying the stimulatory effect is much smaller than the melted region detected in the open complex. This is consistent with the hypothesis that DNA melting can be divided into two steps: nucleation, and the subsequent propagation of DNA melting from the nucleation region, which is not rate-limiting. The nucleation region as suggested by these studies is located in a relatively small region around the −10 region. In addition, in both the depurination and prenicking analyses, the isomerization rate constant from the closed complex into the open complex was stimulated by at least 5-fold. This indicates that the nucleation of DNA melting occurs in the isomerization from the closed complex into the open complex. The stimulatory effect of depurination around the −10 region on open complex formation is clearly due to the involvement of DNA melting this region. For most protein-DNA interactions, depurination is expected to decrease binding due to disruption of essential protein-DNA contacts. Based on this reasoning, depurination has been used in other studies to reveal protein-DNA contact (20Brunelle A. Schleif R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6673-6676Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we also found that depurination at some positions had an inhibitory effect on open complex formation, suggesting that these positions are involved in contact with RNA polymerase. We have carried out DMS1 modification protection studies of the open complex to confirm that most of the guanine bases among these positions are likely to be involved in contacting RNA polymerase. The 564-base pairHindIII-EcoRI fragment containing the λprmup-1Δ265 promoter was isolated and labeled as described previously (21Li X.-Y. McClure W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23549-23557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The end-labeled DNA fragment was digested withHinfI and run on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. The 189-base pair fragment containing the promoter and labeled on either strand at theEcoRI end was eluted from the gel using the Maxam and Gilbert (22Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar) crush and soak procedure. E. coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme (Eς70) was isolated according to Burgess and Jendrisak (23Burgess R.R. Jendrisak J.J. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) and Lowe et al. (24Lowe P.A. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1344-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and its activity was determined as described by Hawley and McClure (25Hawley D.K. McClure W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 493-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The RNA polymerase used in these studies had an activity of 65%. The RNA polymerase concentrations in the text are expressed as active concentrations. Random phosphodiester bond cleavages (nicks) were introduced into the labeled 189-base pair fragment DNA at a frequency of about one nick per molecule by treating with DNase I. Following the treatment, the DNA was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitations. The precipitated DNA was dissolved in TE (10 mm TrisCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA). Partial depurination of the DNA was performed as described (22Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 3 μl of 1.0 m formic acid (J.T. Baker) with pH adjusted to 2.0 using piperidine (Fisher) was added to 30 μl of the end-labeled DNA in TE buffer. Following an incubation of 1 h at 25 °C, the DNA was precipitated with ethanol. The precipitation steps resulted in ∼95% renaturation of the DNA as judged by running samples on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. To assure complete renaturation, the DNA was dissolved in 180 mm NaCl, incubated at 90 °C for 10 min to denature, and then cooled slowly to allow reannealing. The DNA was once again purified by ethanol precipitation, and then dissolved in TE buffer. Open complex formation on the prenicked or depurinated DNA was assayed using the gel retardation method as described (26Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar, 27Garner M.M. Revzin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3047-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Open complexes were formed with 40 nm RNA polymerase and 1 nm prenicked or depurinated DNA at 19 °C in standard reaction buffer (30 mm Hepes (adjusted to pH 7.5 with KOH), 200 mmpotassium glutamate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) (21Li X.-Y. McClure W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23549-23557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). At time zero, 4 μl of RNA polymerase in reaction buffer was mixed with 16 μl DNA in the same buffer. At various times ranging from 0.5 to 60 min, the reactions were stopped with the addition of 4 μl of 180 μg/ml heparin and 4 μl of 40% glycerol. The samples were immediately loaded into a running 4% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide to bis-acrylamide ratio of 59:1). The electrophoresis buffer was 10 mm TrisCl (pH 7.8) and 1 mm EDTA. After electrophoresis, the gel was exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film for about 3 h. The open complex and free DNA bands in the polyacrylamide gel were cut out, and counted in a scintillation counter. The fraction of open complex (F RPo) formed at each time point was calculated as counts per min for the open complex divided by the total counts per min for both the open complex and free DNA. DNA in the gel slices was isolated and prepared for electrophoresis on a sequencing gel following the procedure described by Ausubel et al. (28Ausubel K.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore R.E. Seidman I.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). The polyacrylamide gel slices were placed in an agarose gel with a piece of DEAE membrane inserted in front of each of them. Electrophoresis was carried out to transfer DNA from the gel slices onto the DEAE membranes (with ∼70% recovery). To elute the DNA, each of the membranes was incubated with 200 μl of elution buffer (1m NaCl, 10 mm TrisCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA) at 65 °C for 30 min, and then rinsed with 200 μl TE of buffer. The eluted open complex DNA and free DNA samples (with >80% recovery) were extracted with phenol, and precipitated with ethanol. After this step, the samples of depurinated DNA were dissolved in 1 m piperidine, incubated at 90 °C for 30 min for strand scission at the depurinated positions (22Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar), and then lyophilized. All of the prenicked or depurinated DNA samples were counted in a scintillation counter and were then dissolved in formamide sequencing sample buffer (22Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). The volume of the sample buffer added to each sample was adjusted so that the concentration of the DNA was proportional to the amount of DNA in the corresponding open complex or free DNA band in the retardation gel. Equal volume of each sample was then loaded onto a 9% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea sequencing gel. After electrophoresis, the sequencing gel was dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film. The autoradiograms of the sequencing gels resulting from the prenicking and depurination analyses were quantified using scanning densitometry. The technical details of the densitometry analysis including densitometer scanning of the sequencing autoradiograms, background subtraction, and integration of peaks in the densitometer tracings have been described (21Li X.-Y. McClure W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23549-23557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The fraction of open complex formation (F RPo) for each feature (band or group of bands) was calculated as the integration value of the feature in the lane for an open complex DNA sample divided by the sum of this integration value and the integration value of the corresponding feature in the lane for the free DNA sample at the same time point. TheF RPo was normalized by the maximum fractional open complex formation, F max, and plotted as ln(1 − F RPo) versustime; the rate of open complex formation, k obs, was calculated from the slope of the plot. TheF max used for normalization was theF RPo obtained at 60 min in the gel retardation assay. Using a single value of F max for determining k obs for all of the features was based on the assumption that overall open complex formation was complete at 60 min. This assumption was confirmed by the observation that the maximum values of F RPo for the bands that showed rapid open complex formation (τobs < 2 min) were equal to F max. However, several exceptions to this rule were found as discussed in the text. In addition, for the bands that appeared with rapid kinetics, k obswas determined by fitting to only the first three time points. Open complexes were formed by incubating 40 nm RNA polymerase and 0.25 nm labeled DNA for 60 min at 19 °C in 185 μl of standard reaction buffer. The DMS modification reaction was started with the addition of 1 μl of DMS (50 mm), and was stopped 30 s later with the addition of stopping solution (3.5 μl of 14m (−mercaptoethanol, 50 μl of 1.5 m sodium acetate, 3 μl of 3 mg/ml tRNA, and 700 μl of 95% ethanol). The sample was immediately put into a dry ice-ethanol bath. The DNA was isolated by centrifugation, and precipitated again with ethanol. The precipitated DNA was treated with piperidine, lyophilized, and analyzed on a sequencing gel as described above for the depurinated DNA samples. We analyzed open complex formation on the prenicked, depurinated DNA, as well as untreated DNA using the gel retardation method (27Garner M.M. Revzin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3047-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 28Ausubel K.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore R.E. Seidman I.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). The result from such a experiment using prenicked template is shown in Fig. 1. We found that on all three templates, a single band corresponding to open complex was observed, and the fraction of open complex formed following 60 min of incubation was about 0.8 (± 0.05). In addition, core enzyme and ς subunit each alone did not bind to the promoter DNA. To reveal whether the pretreated DNA has an overall effect on the rate of open complex formation, we have analyzed the open complex formation following various incubation times. We found that the rate of open complex formation determined was similar on pretreated DNA as well as normal untreated DNA (τobs between 17 and 21 min), and was comparable to the rate determined from a parallel experiment using the abortive initiation assay (τobs = 14 min, not shown). Thus, prenicking and depurination did not significantly alter the overall process of open complex formation. This is expected if open complex formation were affected by prenicking or depurination at only a limited number of positions. After showing that partial prenicking and depurination did not alter the overall rate of open complex formation, we carried out further studies to determine whether prenicking and depurination at specific positions would stimulate or inhibit open complex formation. For this purpose, we first separated the open complexes formed on the pretreated DNA at varying times from free DNA using gel retardation method as described above. The DNA samples from both the open complex and free DNA bands were isolated and analyzed by electrophoresis on a sequencing gel. The resulting autoradiograms were quantified by densitometry scanning. In these autoradiograms, each band represented a population of DNA molecules that carried a defect (nick or apurinic site) at a certain position. Consequently, the integration value of a band in a lane for the open complex DNA sample and the integration value of the corresponding band in the lane for the free DNA sample at the same time point were, respectively, proportional to the amounts of DNA in the open complex and free DNA forms. Based on this reasoning, we calculated the fraction of open complex formation (F RPo) for each band or group of bands at each time point using each pair of the integration values. The rate of open complex formation (k obs) for each band was then determined by a plot of ln(1 − F RPo) versustime. The magnitude of the stimulatory or inhibitory effect of DNA defect at each position was calculated by comparing thek obs for each band with the overall rate of open complex formation for the whole promoter region, which is referred to as the average rate of open complex formation (k av). In the sections below, we will first describe the results from the prenicking studies, and the results from depurination studies will follow. Fig. 2 shows representative portions of the autoradiogram of the sequencing gel from a experiment with prenicked DNA. As shown in the figure, several bands corresponding to positions around the −10 region appeared in the lane for the open complex DNA sample and disappeared in the corresponding lane for the free DNA sample at a very early time point (0.5 min), which indicates a stimulatory effect of prenicking at these positions on open complex formation. In the contrary, prenicking at several positions (e.g. −36 on top strand) has an inhibitory effect, which is more obvious at the 60-min time point. Therefore, prenicking at certain positions can either stimulate or inhibit open complex formation. To determine the magnitude of the stimulatory or inhibitory effect of prenicking at each position, we determined the fraction of open complex formed (F RPo) and rate of open complex formation (k obs) for each band or group of bands as described above. The average rate of open complex formation (k av) was determined by quantifying the whole region from −45 to +45. Fig. 3 A shows the plots used to determine k av based on data from both strands. We found that the value of k av derived is comparable to the k obs determined in the gel retardation assay. This indicates that prenicking in the region from −45 to +45 did not significantly change the overall rate of open complex formation. Fig. 3 B shows several plots used to determine thek obs for single bands or small groups of bands. The plots are representative of three types of bands each displaying ak obs very different (larger or smaller) or similar to k av. Three fitted lines representing each type of the bands are shown: the fitted line in the middle was derived from the data for the whole region from −45 to +45 on the top strand, and corresponded to a k obs (defined ask av) value of 7.8 ± 0.5 × 10−4 s−1; the lower line was fitted to the data for a small group of bands, −7 to −9, and corresponds to ak obs of 1.4 ± 0.3 × 10−2 s−1, which is approximately 20-fold higher than k av; the upper line was fitted to the data for the −35 band and corresponds to ak obs of 3.4 ± 0.4 × 10−4 s−1, which is less than halfk av. For the bands that displayed rapid kinetics, the rate constants could not be accurately determined; the values reported here are lower estimates. On the other hand, for the bands with slow kinetics, open complex formation might not have reached a final value at 60 min. Consequently, we are not certain whether open complex formation for these bands would reach the same F max that we have used to normalizeF RPo in determining thek obs. In our analysis, the effects on both the rate and F max would contribute to the apparent changes in k obs. Consequently, the magnitudes of inhibition on k obs would be slightly overestimated in those cases where smaller F maxwould be reached. The effects of prenicking at different positions on the rate of open complex formation are summarized in Fig. 4. The magnitudes of stimulation and inhibition are expressed as R (=k obs/k av) and −1/R, respectively, i.e. in terms of how many fold the rate of open complex formation was stimulated or inhibited. It is clear from the figure that prenicking at most positions within the promoter did not significantly affect the rate of open complex formation. However, prenicking at positions around the −10 region (−12 to −1 on the top strand, and −12 to −4 on the bottom strand) strongly stimulated open complex formation. The magnitude of stimulation is up to 20-fold. The k obs values for the these positions were up to 8 times larger than the isomerization rate constant k f (1.8 × 10−3 s−1) measured on the unmodified template using abortive initiation assays (15Erie D.A. Jones R.A. Olson W.K. Sinha N.K. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), i.e. prenicking at these positions stimulated the isomerization rate constant by at least 8-fold (see “Discussion”). Significant stimulation was not observed outside this region. Fig. 4 also shows that prenicking at several positions had a small inhibitory effect on open complex formation. Inhibition of >50% was observed at positions −17, −18, −19, −25, −35, −36, and −37 on the top strand, and at positions +3 to +5 on the bottom strand. We considered the possibility that the complexes formed on some of the nicked DNA molecules might not be open complexes. To show this conjecture to be false, we carried out the following experiments. First, following open complex formation with prenicked DNA, transcription reaction was carried out with the addition of all four nucleoside triphosphates together with heparin. The complexes remained following transcription and the free DNA were then separated by gel retardation method. The results showed that the amount of complex detected in the polyacrylamide gel decreased by about 60% after transcription, and importantly a similar result was obtained with unnicked DNA. This indicates that there is no general deficiency for open complexes formed on prenicked DNA to transcribe. To further show that the complexes formed on all of the DNA species (i.e.DNA molecules nicked at different positions) were equally capable of transcription and consequently are open complexes, DNA from both the complex and free DNA bands was isolated and analyzed on a sequencing gel. Quantification analysis of the resulting autoradiogram shows that the intensities of all the bands in the lane for the stable complex DNA sample decreased by a similar extent after transcription. Therefore, the complexes formed on templates with nicks at different positions are indeed open complexes. Representative portions of the sequencing autoradiograms resulting from the depurination studies are shown in Fig. 5. The average rate of open complex formation, k av, was determined by quantifying the region from −45 to +30 as a whole, and corresponded to a value of k av = 7.0 ± 0.6 × 10−4s−1. Again, this value is very similar to that determined in gel retardation assay, suggesting that partial depurination in this region does not have an overall effect on the rate of open complex formation. As shown for prenicking, even though depurination at most positions did not have a strong effect on open complex formation, at some positions it had a strong stimulatory effect, and at yet some other positions an inhibitory effect was observed. For example, the −33 band had ak obs of 3.1 ± 0.2 × 10−4 s−1, which is less than halfk av; the −9 band had ak obs of 7.0 ± 4.7 × 10−3 s−1, which is about 10 times larger thank av. As discussed for prenicking studies, the rate of open complex formation may be overestimated for the bands with slow kinetics, while for bands showing rapid kinetics, the rate constants determined are probably lower estimates. Fig. 6 summarizes the magnitude of the stimulatory or inhibitory effect of depurination at each position of the promoter DNA on the rate of open complex formation. As shown in the figure, depurination at all positions from −10 to −4 on the top strand and from −12 to −6 on the bottom strand had a major stimulatory effect on the rate of open complex formation. The magnitudes of the stimulation range from 8- to about 15-fold. Thek obs values for these positions were up to 6 times larger than the isomerization rate constantk f, i.e. depurination at these positions stimulated the isomerization rate constant by at least 6-fold as discussed for prenicking. Depurination at positions −2 and −3 resulted in some stimulation, but it was of much lower magnitude (2–3-fold). In addition, 2–4-fold stimulation was also observed at positions +19, +20, and +26 on the bottom strand. Those positions where depurination inhibited open complex formation can also be identified in Fig. 6. The positions showing more than 50% inhibition on k obs were +3 to +5, −13, −14, −16, −17, −30, −32, and −33 on the top strand, and −28, −35, and −36 on the bottom strand. These positions might be in contact with RNA polymerase during open complex formation (see “Discussion”). We carried out DMS modification protection studies to reveal the RNA polymerase-promoter contacts on the guanine bases in the open complex. As shown in Fig. 7, the guanines at positions −14 and −16 on the top strand, and at positions −3 and −31 on the bottom strand were the only bases protected from DMS modification. The guanines at positions −2, −10, −17, and −33 on the top strand were enhanced. These results will be compared with those from the depurination analysis in terms of RNA polymerase-promoter interaction (see “Discussion”). We have found that both prenicking and depurination around the −10 region strongly stimulated the rate of open complex formation. This indicates that: (i) the structural instability of the −10 region is important for promoter function; (ii) the process of destabilizing a small region of promoter DNA around the −10 region, which we refer to as the nucleation of DNA melting, contributes to the rate of open complex formation; (iii) the nucleation of DNA melting may normally occur in the region where prenicking and depurination stimulated open complex formation (if so, then this region is smaller than the entire DNA melting region); (iv) the propagation of DNA melting from the nucleation site(s) is not rate-limiting. Based on the results from promoter mutations, it is clear that base pair identity in the −10 region is important for RNA polymer"

DNase I footprinting analysis revealed a single protected region in the proximal promoter of the CYP2A3 gene with nuclear extracts from olfactory mucosa, but not from liver, lung, kidney, or brain. The core sequence of the binding site, named the nasal predominant transcriptional activating (NPTA) element, is similar to that of nuclear factor 1, but it interacted with unique proteins detected only in the olfactory mucosa in electrophoretic mobility shift assays or on Southwestern blots. The NPTA element is conserved in ratCYP2A3, mouse Cyp2a5, and humanCYP2A6 genes and was found to be essential for transcriptional activity of the CYP2A3 promoter in in vitro transcription assays. NPTA-binding proteins were detectable at day 1 and were much more abundant at day 8 than at day 60 after birth. Furthermore, their levels decreased dramatically during chemically induced degeneration of the olfactory epithelium, paralleling the disappearance of CYP2A3 protein, and rebounded to higher than pretreatment levels during recovery. Thus, we have identified a novel transcriptional activation element potentially responsible for the olfactory mucosa-predominant expression of theCYP2A3 gene in rats and orthologous genes in mice and humans.

Although not all of these genes are well characterized with respect to biological functions, their unique tissue- and cell-specific expression suggests functional importance in the olfactory epithelium, a tissue that is highly specialized for molecular recognition.

Coon M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 454-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). CYP2A3 is a major P450 isoform in rat olfactory mucosa and, except for trace levels in the lung, has not been detected in any other tissues examined (9Kimura S. Kozak C.A. Gonzalez F.J.

Orthologous CYP2A isoforms are also expressed predominantly in the nasal mucosa in other species including mice, rabbits, and cows (10Su T. Sheng J.J. Lipinskas T.W. Ding X. Drug Metab.

Ding, unpublished results. and was found to increase rapidly after birth in rabbits (23Ding X. Peng H.M. Coon M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 1027-1032PubMed Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies of rat and mouse olfactory epithelium indicated that CYP2A expression is restricted to the sustentacular and Bowman's gland cells of the chemosensory mucosa but is not detectable in the neuronal cells (24Zupko K. Poria Y. Lancet D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Chen Y. Getchell M.L. Ding X. Getchell T.V.

Studies with purified or heterologously expressed nasal CYP2As as well as microsomal studies indicated that, collectively, these isoforms are active in the biotransformation of odorants, such as coumarin and butanol, and endogenous compounds, such as testosterone, as well as many nasal toxicants (cf. Refs. 16Ding X. Coon M.J. Schenkman J.B. Greim H. Cytochrome P450: Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer-Verlag, New York1993: 351-361Google Scholar and 27Liu C. Zhuo X. Gonzalez F.J. Ding X. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 781-788PubMed Google Scholar). CYP2A expression during olfactory neurodegeneration and subsequent regeneration has also been studied. An early report indicated that unilateral naris closure in mice results in loss of olfactory neurons in the open side and a reduction in CYP2A and CYP2G1 immunoreactivity in the nonneuronal cells (26Walters E. Buchheit K. Maruniak J.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 33: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Loss of olfactory epithelial P450 expression was also found in bulbectomized mice. Similar observations were made in a methyl bromide-induced olfactory degeneration model in rats (28Schwob J.E. Youngentob S.L. Mezza R.C. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 359: 15-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). More recent studies indicated that reduction of P450 expression also occurred during olfactory neurodegeneration induced by treatment of rodents with dichlobenil or coumarin (29Walters E. Buchheit K.

To understand the mechanisms that dictate tissue-selective expression of the nasalCYP2A genes, we have examined the 5′-flanking region of theCYP2A3 gene in the present study using in vitromethods with nuclear extracts from rat and mouse tissues. Initial DNase I footprinting analysis revealed a single protected region in the proximal promoter sequence with nuclear extracts from olfactory mucosa, but not from liver, lung, kidney, or brain. The tissue-specific binding was confirmed by gel shift analysis, which revealed multiple bands. The core sequence of the binding site, named the NPTA (nasalpredominant transcriptionalactivating) element, was determined and found to be essential for transcriptional activity of the CYP2A3promoter in vitro. The developmental expression and olfactory epithelial degeneration-associated alterations in NPTA-binding proteins were also examined by gel shift analysis, and the nature of the NPTA-binding proteins was probed using supershift assays and Southwestern blots. Our results strongly indicate the presence of a novel transcriptional activation element that may be responsible for the olfactory mucosa-predominant expression of the CYP2A3gene in rats and orthologous genes in mice and humans. All animals were obtained from breeding stocks maintained at the Wadsworth Center. Tissues from male and female Wistar rats at ages of between 1 and 60 days and male C57BL/6 mice at the age of about 2 months were used for preparation of nuclear extracts. To induce degeneration of the olfactory epithelium, 60-day-old male rats (200–250 g) were treated with coumarin (Sigma; 50 mg/kg body weight, injected once, intraperitoneally, in 0.1 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide) as recently described (30Gu J. Walker V.E. Lipinskas T.W. Walker D.M. Ding X. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 146: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Animals were sacrificed at 0, 3, or 48 h or 7 days following the injection, and tissues from four rats per group were combined for preparation of nuclear extracts. The protocol of Dignamet al. (34Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9163) Google Scholar), modified by Kudrycki et al. (11Kudrycki K. Stein-Izsak C. Behn C.

Tissues from at least four rats or eight mice were pooled for each preparation. Nuclear extracts prepared using this protocol are referred to as “crude nuclear extracts” to distinguish from the more enriched “nuclear protein extracts.” Transcriptionally active nuclear protein extracts of rat olfactory mucosa were used for in vitro transcription assays and were prepared essentially according to the method of Gorski et al.

All preparations were stored in small aliquots at −85 °C. Assays were performed essentially as described elsewhere (37Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Binding reaction mixtures, which were preincubated at room temperature for 10 min, contained 15–20 μg of crude nuclear extracts in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 8% glycerol, and 3–5 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Stratagene) or 5–10 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and, for competition experiments, unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide (at 50–200-fold excess). Labeled probes (about 1 ng and 10,000 cpm) were added to the mixtures to a final volume of 20 μl and incubated for another 20 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes and unbound probes were separated by electrophoresis through 6% polyacrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography. For supershift experiments, up to 7 μl of a control rabbit serum or a polyclonal rabbit anti-CTF1 serum (38Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) was incubated with the nuclear extracts for 1 h at room temperature before the addition of the labeled probe (2A3pm1). DNase I footprinting analyses were performed with the Core Footprinting System from Promega, according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA-protein binding reactions were performed as described above for the gel shift assays, except that the reaction mixtures contained 40–60 μg of crude nuclear extracts and labeled DNA fragments (about 2 ng and 40,000 cpm) in a final volume of 50 μl. The binding reaction mixtures were incubated on ice for 20 min before mixing with 50 μl of the DNase reaction buffer (10 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm CaCl2) and incubated at room temperature for an additional minute. DNase I (0.1–1 unit) was then added, and the DNase digestion was allowed to proceed for 60–90 s at room temperature. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of a DNase stop solution (200 mm NaCl, 30 mmEDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml yeast RNA). DNA was recovered from the reaction mixture by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and the washed pellets were air-dried and resuspended in 5 μl of a gel loading buffer (95% (v/v) deionized formamide, 50 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% (w/v) each of xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue). The samples were denatured by heating at 90 °C for 3 min and analyzed by electrophoresis through 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea DNA sequencing gels. DNA sequence ladders were produced by the method of Maxam and Gilbert (39Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar). Southwestern blotting was performed essentially as described by Abe and Kufe (40Abe M. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), with minor modification. Crude nuclear extracts were submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10%) electrophoresis using the Laemmli system (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207476) Google Scholar). The resolved proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (42Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44943) Google Scholar) and renatured by incubating with 100 ml of 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) at room temperature for 3 h. To detect specific DNA-binding proteins, the sheets were first incubated in about 5 ml of a binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 15 μg of poly(dI-dC) or 5 μg of salmon sperm DNA per ml) and, for competition experiments only, unlabeled oligonucleotide probes (at a 200-fold excess) at room temperature for 30 min to block nonspecific binding. A32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe was then added at 20,000 cpm/ml (approximately 2 ng/ml), and the incubation was continued for another 2 h. The blots were washed twice (5 min each) with a wash buffer (same as the binding buffer, but containing 100 mmNaCl), and the DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography. The sizes of the DNA-binding proteins were estimated using prestained molecular weight markers from Bio-Rad (low range). In vitro transcription was performed essentially as described elsewhere (43Ueno T. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4495-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 44Tamura T. Konishi Y.

Reaction mixtures contained 60 μg of nuclear protein extract, ∼1 μg of a plasmid DNA template (in H2O), 1× reaction buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 25 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 3% glycerol, 0.6 mm each ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP), and 1 μl (40 units) of RNasin (Promega) in a total volume of 24 μl. The reactions were conducted at 30 °C for 60 min and were terminated by adding 400 μl of a stop solution (0.5% SDS, 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 50 μg/ml yeast tRNA, and 100 μg/ml proteinase K) and incubating at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction mixtures were extracted with phenol/chloroform, and the RNA products were precipitated with ethanol. Pelleted RNAs were resuspended in 35 μl of a hybridization buffer (42 mm PIPES, 420 mm NaCl, 53% formamide, and 1.1 mm EDTA) and hybridized with 5 μl of a32P-labeled antisense oligonucleotide probe (20 ng/μl) for detecting specific transcripts using an S1 nuclease protection assay. The mixture was added to 350 μl of S1 reaction solution (150 mm sodium acetate (pH 8.0), 1 m NaCl, and 15 mm ZnSO4) containing 300 units of S1 nuclease (Promega), and digestion was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 30 min, followed by the addition of 70 μl of S1 stop buffer (1.8m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm EDTA, and 150 μg/ml yeast tRNA). The RNA-DNA heteroduplexes and DNA size markers (see below) were denatured; resolved on 10% polyacrylamide, 7m urea gels; and detected by autoradiography. Plasmids used as templates in in vitro transcription assays were constructed in pCR-Script SK AMP vector (Stratagene) using DNA fragments derived from a CYP2A3 genomic clone (31Ueno T. Gonzalez F.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4623-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Plasmid p2A3–1900 was constructed by inserting a SacI (−1900)/EcoRI (+582) fragment of the CYP2A3 gene into the unique SacI/EcoRI sites in the pCR-Script vector. Plasmid p2A3–254 was constructed by inserting theBamHI (−254)/BglI (+58) fragment of theCYP2A3 gene into the SrfI site of the pCR-Script vector following treatment with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) to generate blunt ends. Plasmid p2A3–254/M was made by site-directed mutation of p2A3–254 to convert a TG dinucleotide (−127 and −126) to a GT, using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit from CLONTECH. The mutagenesis experiment was performed according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer, using two mismatched oligonucleotide primers: one containing the intended sites of mutation in CYP2A3 proximal promoter (5′-CCTCCTTGAGTGTGTGCTATGTCCCAAACTAGG-3′) and the other containing a mutation in the unique EcoRI site in the vector (5′-TTGATATCGAAGTCCTGCAGCC-3′). A control plasmid, pOMP-280, was constructed by inserting a −280 to +105 fragment derived from the rat OMP gene into the SrfI site of the pCR-Script vector. This genomic fragment was obtained by PCR using rat genomic DNA as template and primers designed according to published sequences (45Danciger E. Mettling C. Vidal M. Morris R. Margolis F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8565-8569Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar): 5′-CCTGTGGAGTATTCTGTTCTTCAC-3′ (upstream) and 5′-AGAACCAGCGGCATATCCAGCT-3′ (downstream). The structures of all promoter constructs were verified by sequencing. The oligonucleotide probe used for detecting CYP2A3 transcripts in S1 nuclease protection assays is complementary to positions +1 to +52 of the CYP2A3 gene, and the S1 probe for OMP transcripts is complementary to +1 to +41 of the OMP gene. The sizes of the protected fragments detected in S1 nuclease assays were estimated from the positions of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide fragments analyzed on the same gels. The 30- and 46-nucleotide oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized, while the 100-nucleotide fragment was gel-purified from the 100-base pair DNA size marker from Life Technologies, Inc. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Molecular Genetics Core of the Wadsworth Center. To prepare 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes for gel shift assays, one strand of the synthetic oligonucleotide was labeled at the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) and then annealed to a 5-fold excess of unlabeled complementary strand. The resulting labeled double-stranded DNA probe was separated from unincorporated nucleotides using a Sephadex G-25 spin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and from the remaining single-stranded DNAs by gel purification with a 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel; the probe was recovered from gel using a Micropure separator from Amicon (Beverly, MA). Single-stranded DNA probes for S1 nuclease protection assays were labeled with 32P and purified in the same manner. Unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides used as competitors were prepared by annealing equimolar amounts of the two complementary strands. 32P-Labeled, double-stranded cDNA probes for DNase I footprinting experiments were prepared by PCR with one 5′-end-labeled primer and one unlabeled primer of the complementary strand and using the p2A3–254 plasmid (see above) as template. This ensures that the resulting cDNA probe is labeled on only one strand. The primers used for labeling the coding strand were 5′-32P-CTGTCCTCTGTAATGCATAGTT-3′ (−231 to −210) and M13 reverse primer in the multiple cloning region of the vector, and the primers for labeling the noncoding strand were 5′-32P-GCAACTGTCTAATTTTA-3′ (−67 to −83) and the KS primer complementary to vector sequence. Briefly, a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 10 pmol of one PCR primer, 2 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP, 1× kinase buffer, and 8 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase was added to a 0.5-ml PCR reaction tube and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction was quenched by heating at 70 °C for 10 min. The remaining components of the PCR reaction were then added in 40 μl, containing 100 ng of template DNA, 20 pmol of the second PCR primer, and the other components in standard amounts. PCRs were performed in a Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermal cycler for 30 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 15 s and annealing and extension at 68 °C for 20 s, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 15 min. The labeled PCR product was gel-purified before use. DNA sequence analyses were performed by the Molecular genetics Core of the Wadsworth Center using an automated sequencer from Applied Biosystems (model 373A, Foster City, CA). Plasmid DNAs were prepared using QIAprep Spin Plasmid kit, and purification of DNA fragments from agarose gels was conducted using QIAquick or QIAEX II agarose gel extraction kit (QIAGEN). Protein concentration in nuclear extracts was determined using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Unlabeled DNAs were quantitated spectrally by absorbance at 260 nm. The concentrations of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes were estimated based on the amounts of starting material in the labeling reactions, whereas the concentration of32P-labeled PCR products for footprinting experiments was estimated from the band intensity on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels using known amounts of DNA as standards. The proximal promoter of the CYP2A3 gene was initially analyzed by DNase I footprinting assay (Fig. 1). As shown in panel A, a single protected region was detected on the noncoding strand (−134 to −112) with nuclear extracts from rat olfactory mucosa, but not from lung, kidney, brain, and liver. Protein binding to this site was competed by an unlabeled oligonucleotide probe, 2A3pm1 (−140 to −108), that comprises the protected sequence. Identical results were also obtained with nuclear extracts from mice (panel B). With a probe labeled on the coding strand, a similar region (−129 to −108) was protected by olfactory mucosal nuclear extracts from either rats (panel C) or mice (data not shown). The protected site, which is named the NPTA element, is about 80 bp upstream of a TATA box (Fig. 1 D). A comparison of the NPTA element with those included in TFMATRIX transcription factor binding site profile data base (46Wingender E. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Karas H. Heinemeyer T. Dietze P. Knuppel R. Romaschenko A.G. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) revealed that the binding site contained an NF-1-like sequence (47Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Rosenfeld P.J. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 48: 79-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) (score of 87.3%) and an IK-2 (48Molnar A. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and a LYF-1 element (49Lo K. Landau N.R. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5229-5243Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) in reverse orientation. However, competition experiments with these elements as well as with the binding sites for OLF-1 or upstream binding element (UBE) of the rat OMP gene (11Kudrycki K. Stein-Izsak C. Behn C. Grillo M. Akeson R. Margolis F.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3002-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) revealed that only NF-1 and UBE (which also contain an NF-1-like sequence) competed for binding to the NPTA element by olfactory epithelial nuclear proteins, and with the NF-1 and UBE sequences, only partial competition was observed (Fig. 2 and Table I). Thus, the NPTA site is not likely to interact with OLF-1, IK-2, or LYF-1 factors, but it may bind NF-1 type transcription factors in vivo. However, the partial competition by the NF-1 and UBE sequences also suggests that the olfactory epithelial NPTA-binding proteins may be unique despite the apparent homology of the NPTA element with NF-1.Table ICharacterization of NPTA-binding site in the CYP2A3 gene using various oligonucleotide competitors in gel shift assaysSource of competitorName of competitorPositionSequence of competitorStrength of competitionAdenovirus type 2NF-1+22 to +46TTTTGGATTGAAGCCAATATGATAA+Rat OMP promoterUBE−587 to −563CCTCTGGGAGCCGAGCCAGCCATCT+OLF-1−190 to −158CCATGCTCTGGTCCCCAAGGAGCCTGTCACCCT−Murine TdT promoterLYF-1−107 to −91TCCATTTTGGGAGAAAG−IK-BS2IK-2(Created)TCAGCTTTTGGGAATCTCCTGTCA−Rat CYP2A3 promoter2A3pm1−140 to −108CCTCCTTGAGTGTTGGCTATGTCCCAAACTAGG+++2A3mut1−140 to −108CCTCCTTGAGCATTGGCTATGTCCCAAACTAGG+++2A3mut2−140 to −108CCTCCTTGAGTGTCAGCTATGTCCCAAACTAGG−2A3mut3−140 to −108CCTCCTTGAGTGTACGCTATGTCCCAAACTAGG−2A3mut4−140 to −108CCTCCTTGAGTGTGTGCTATGTCCCAAACTAGG−2A3mut5−140 to −108CCTCCTTGAGTGTTGCATATGTCCCAAACTAGG−2A3mut6−140 to −108CCTCCTTGAGTGTTGGCTACATCCCAAACTAGG+++2A3mut7−140 to −108CCTCCTTGAGTGTTGGCTATGAGCCAAACTAGG+++2A3mut8−140 to −108CCTCCTTGAGTGTTGGCTATGTCTCAAACTAGG+2A3mut9−140 to −108CCTCCTTGAGTGTTGGCTATATCCTAAACTAGG−2A3mut10−140 to −108CCTCCTTGAGTGTTGGCTATGTCCGTAACTAGG−2A3mut11−140 to"

To determine whether the metabolism of VN-TAT ternary complexes is different from that previously reported for binary TAT complexes, plasma clearance studies were done in rabbits using human VN-TAT. 125I-VN-TAT was shown to be cleared rapidly from the circulation (t½α = 3.8 min) in a biphasic manner mainly by the liver. 125I-TAT had a similar initial clearance (t½α = 5.3 min) but had a significantly faster β-phase clearance (t½β = 42.8 min versus85.4 min for VN-TAT; p = 0.005). Protamine sulfate and heparin abolished the rapid initial α-phase of125I-VN-TAT clearance and reduced its liver-specific association and in vivo degradation. Heparin also reduced the α-phase clearance of 125I-TAT and was associated with the appearance of high molecular weight complexes, suggesting enhanced complex formation between VN and TAT. 125I-VN-TAT binding to HepG2 cells was reduced by competition with VN-TAT or heparin but to a much lesser extent in the presence of TAT. The binding of VN-TAT to HepG2 cells was not inhibited by competition with the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein ligand, methylamine-α2-macroglobulin. 125I-VN-TAT binding was also inhibited by treating HepG2 cells with heparinase or by growing the cells in the presence of β-d-xyloside. Finally, both heparin and chloroquine, but not methylamine-α2-macroglobulin, reduced the internalization and degradation of VN-TAT by HepG2 cells. Taken together, these data indicate the importance of VN in TAT metabolism and demonstrate that VN-TAT binds to liver-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which mediate its internalization and subsequent intracellular degradation.

Antithrombin (AT)1 is a member of the protein superfamily known as the serpins (1Sheffield W.P. Wu Y.I. Blajchman M.A. High K.A. Roberts H.R. Molecular Basis of Thrombosis and Hemostasis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 355-377Google Scholar). Included in this family are heparin cofactor II (HCII), α1-proteinase inhibitor, α1-antichymotrypsin, the plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI-1 and -2), protease nexin-1 (PN-1), and the noninhibitory proteins ovalbumin and angiotensinogen (2Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landes Co., New York1996: 1-191Google Scholar). The majority of serpins inhibit their cognate proteinases by forming covalent 1:1 stoichiometric serpin-enzyme complexes (SECs) with them. For example, AT is the main physiological inhibitor of thrombin, forming thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes. These SECs are removed rapidly from the circulation by hepatic receptors (2Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G.

Vitronectin (VN), a 78-kDa glycoprotein synthesized by the liver, is found in the circulation at a plasma concentration of 200–400 μg/ml (12Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Blood. 1986; 68: 737-742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VN plays a key role in the attachment of cells to their surrounding matrix (13Preissner K.T. Jenne D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Prog. Hemost. Thromb. 1990; 10: 269-305Google Scholar) and has been found to have various functions in proteolytic cascades. For example, VN has been shown to stabilize the major inhibitor of fibrinolysis PAI-1 (15Mimuro J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 936-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to inhibit the complement system (16Podack E.R. Kolb W.P. Muller-Eberhard H.J. J.

Chem. 1987; 262: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the metabolism of binary forms of SECs have been well studied, ternary complexes have not, despite the fact that VN has been shown to play an important role in the metabolism of various SECs. For example, TAT in serum or plasma has been found to exist in the form of a covalent ternary complex with VN (20Ill C.R. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15610-15615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21de Boer H.C. de Groot P.G. Bouma B.N. Preissner K.T. J. Biol.

Pannekoek H. de Groot P.G. Semin. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 22: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The formation of ternary complexes with VN suggests that VN may be important physiologically in the metabolism of various SECs. In this study, we have examined the metabolism of 125I-VN-TATin vivo and have identified hepatocyte-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) as major binding sites involved in the metabolism of VN-TAT both in vivo and in vitro. Chloroquine, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, nitroblue tetrazolium, methylamine, bovine serum albumin (BSA), heparinase (heparin lyase I from Flavobacterium heparinum), p-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside (β-d-xyloside), protamine sulfate (grade X, from salmon), and heparin (grade 1-A, from porcine intestines) were purchased from Sigma. IODO-GEN was purchased from Pierce.d-Phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine-chloromethylketone (>99% active) was purchased from Calbiochem. The protein assay kit was purchased from Bio-Rad (Mississauga, ON). VN-TAT was purified by heparin-Sepharose chromatography from human serum as described by de Boer et al. (28de Boer H.C. Preissner K.T. Bouma B.N. de Groot P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2264-2268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the purified VN-TAT was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The relative amounts of AT and HCII in the VN-TAT preparations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (23Liu L. Dewar L. Song Y. Kulczycky K. Blajchman M.A. Fenton J.W., II Andrew M. Delorme M. Ginsberg J. Preissner K.T. Ofosu F.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Purified human AT concentrate was the generous gift of Bayer Canada Inc. (Toronto, Canada). Human α-thrombin (>2,000 units/mg and >99% active) was the generous gift of Dr. J. Fenton (New York State Division of Biologicals, Albany, NY). Rabbit anti-human VN antibodies were purchased from Celsus Laboratories Inc. (Cincinnati, OH). Goat anti-human HCII serum was purchased from Diagnostica Stago through Murex Diagnostics (Guelph, Canada). The use of sheep anti-human AT IgG has been described previously (29Sheffield W.P. Blajchman M.A. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 293-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified chicken anti-human α-thrombin IgG was raised as described (11Wells M.J.

Electrophoretically pure α2-macroglobulin was purchased from Calbiochem and modified with methylamine as described previously (30Wu S.M. Pizzo S.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells, purchased from the ATCC (Rockville, MD), were grown in α-MEM, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml of penicillin-streptomycin. For radioiodination of all proteins, IODO-GEN-coated glass vials were used as described previously (31Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). After radioiodination, VN-TAT had a specific activity of 1,400–2,800 dpm/ng; human thrombin had a specific activity of 2,100–2,700 dpm/ng; AT had a specific activity of 4,400 dpm/ng; and α2M* had a specific activity of 12,000 dpm/ng. TAT was formed by incubating thrombin, or125I-thrombin, at a 1:3 molar ratio with AT, at 37 °C for 30 min. To inhibit residual active thrombin,d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine-chloromethylketone was added to the reaction mixture at a final concentration of 100 μm and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The TAT preparation was dialyzed against α-MEM buffered with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) (HMEM) overnight at 4 °C and then aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. 125I-TAT was aliquoted immediately after preparation and stored at −70 °C. 500 ng of purified VN-TAT was electrophoresed on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose (0.4 A, 4 °C, 1 h). Blotted proteins were detected using rabbit anti-human VN (at 1:5,000 dilution), chicken anti-thrombin (10 μg/ml), sheep anti-human AT (7.2 μg/ml), or rabbit anti-human HCII antiserum (at 1:50 dilution). Bound primary antibody was then detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (at 1:5,000 dilution). Young male New Zealand White rabbits, weighing between 2.2 and 2.7 kg were infused intravenously with 125I-VN-TAT (12.6–17.5 × 106 dpm; 8–16 μg/animal), 125I-TAT (3.4–17.5 × 106 dpm; 3–3.5 μg/animal), or125I-AT (12.6 × 106 dpm; ∼2.9 μg/animal) made up in 1 ml of saline. For competition experiments, heparin (10,000, 5,000, or 1,000 units/ml) or protamine sulfate (65 mg/ml) was dissolved in sterile saline, and 125I-VN-TAT was added directly to each solution just prior to intravenous injection. All infusions were done using the marginal ear vein of the rabbit. Blood samples (1 ml) were taken at various time points, from the auricular artery of the opposite ear, into 200 μl of anticoagulant (CP2D obtained from the Canadian Red Cross Society; it contained 0.016m citric acid, 0.09 m sodium citrate, 0.016m monobasic sodium phosphate, and 0.284 mdextrose). After thorough mixing, they were placed into microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g. For each sample, 100 μl was counted for radioactivity directly, while another 100-μl aliquot was added to 100 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid, vortexed, and left on ice for 15 min. The trichloroacetic acid-treated samples were then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were removed to determine radioactivity. The plasma from the blood sample taken at the 1-min time point was designated as representing 100% radioactivity. The clearance data were analyzed using the technique of curve stripping as described previously (32Fleck A. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 1985; 22: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, the logarithm of the fraction of protein-associated radioactivity remaining in the circulation was plotted versus time. The terminal exponential phase of clearance was curve-fit by linear regression. To determine the initial clearance phase, the contribution of the terminal clearance phase was subtracted from it as follows. Initial clearance data were substituted into the equation of the line (for the terminal clearance curve) and then subtracted from their initial clearance values, and then the new data were plotted and analyzed by linear regression. This analysis revealed a biphasic clearance curve for VN-TAT and TAT, indicating a two-compartment clearance model. This clearance model is described by the equation,y(t)=C1e−(a1)t+C2e−(a2)t(Eq. 1) where C n are coefficients and a n are rate constants. The half-lives were determined from the a values. The data for the clearance of VN-TAT in the presence of heparin or protamine sulfate best fit a single-compartment clearance model. The clearance parametersC n, a n, and t½ were then compared using a two-tailedt test, and values are reported as the mean ± S.E. For the determination of organ uptake,125I-VN-TAT (17.5 × 106 dpm; 5.5 μg) was injected into male New Zealand White rabbits (n = 3). After 1 h, the rabbits were anesthetized, and the femoral veins were isolated and opened. One liter of saline was then perfused into each animal via a carotid artery cannula. The perfusion in all cases was judged to be successful by evidence of blanching of the liver and the lack of blood in the perfusate at the completion of the perfusion. The liver, lungs, kidneys, bladder, heart, and spleen were removed from each animal and weighed. The individual organs were then homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann, Switzerland) in Tris-buffered saline, with ∼25 ml of octanol added to prevent foaming, for ∼2 min each, at ∼75% of the highest setting. After measuring the volume of each homogenate, 2 ml was removed for the determination of the radioactivity present. In the experiments with125I-VN-TAT (∼12.6 × 106 dpm) either alone or in competition with heparin (10,000 units/ml) (n = 3 for each), the incubation period was reduced to only 30 min, and only the livers were removed and processed for determination of radioactive uptake. For these experiments, HepG2 cells were grown on 24-well plates to a final density of ∼4.5 × 105 cells/well. Binding experiments were performed in HMEM containing 0.5% BSA. The HepG2 cells were washed in binding buffer and then incubated with125I-VN-TAT, with or without competitors, at 4 °C for 2 h. The cells were then washed three times with 10 mmHEPES (pH = 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% BSA (HBSB). The cells and associated radioactivity were solubilized by incubation with 2 m NaOH overnight before counting for radioactivity. For experiments with HepG2 cells using β-d-xyloside, the cells were trypsinized and replated on 24-well culture dishes, in the presence of a final concentration of 2.5 mm β-d-xyloside in the cell culture medium for 3 days, before conducting the binding experiment. This reagent was made up in dimethyl sufoxide, and an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to control wells. In experiments using heparinase, the HepG2 cells were washed twice with HMEM. The heparinase was then added in HMEM and incubated with the cells for 2.5 h at 37 °C, at a final concentration of 30 units/ml. HepG2 cells were grown in 24-well culture dishes to 80% confluency and washed in HBSB.125I-VN-TAT, at a final concentration of 10 nm, was then incubated with the HepG2 cells, in the presence or absence of competitors at 37 °C, in HMEM containing 0.5% BSA. The competitors used were heparin (100 units/ml final concentration), chloroquine (100 μm final concentration), or α2M* (775 nm final concentration). 125I-VN-TAT in reaction buffer was added to the wells of 24-well culture dishes that had been preincubated with α-MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin, to control for non-cell-mediated protein degradation over the experimental time periods. At the appropriate time points (0, 1, 4, and 17 h) 100 μl of the reaction medium was added to 100 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. To determine true cell-mediated degradation of the proteins, the total trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts from the control wells were subtracted from the trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts in the experimental wells. In order to investigate the metabolism of VN-TAT in vitro and in vivo, VN-TAT was purified by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. Under nonreducing conditions, the VN-TAT was seen as an ∼160-kDa monomer but also as higher molecular weight multimers. When VN-TAT was electrophoresed under reducing conditions, it appeared to break down to form three new bands, one of 97 kDa that co-migrated with TAT and two additional bands of mobility intermediate to TAT and AT, which most likely represent the two forms of VN found in plasma. This observation is consistent with the concept that VN-TAT formation is through a disulfide interchange between VN and the thrombin in the TAT complex, as previously reported (21de Boer H.C. de Groot P.G. Bouma B.N. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1279-1283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the purified VN-TAT was composed of AT, VN, and thrombin, immunoblotting analyses were performed. Fig. 1 shows the immunological detection of VN (lane 1), AT (lane 2), and thrombin (lane 4). All three proteins were detected in the major band of ∼160 kDa. Higher molecular weight multimers composed of VN, AT, and thrombin were also detected. Interestingly, a minor lower molecular weight band was also detected, which, from the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels, corresponds to a molecular mass of ∼60 kDa. This band most likely represents degradation of the ternary complex, since antibodies against VN (lane 1), AT (lane 2), and thrombin (lane 4) appeared to recognize it. Since VN can form ternary complexes with thrombin-HCII binary complexes, Western blot analysis was performed to determine whether these ternary complexes were present in the VN-TAT preparation. VN-thrombin-HCII complexes were detected and, like VN-TAT, appeared to be composed of multimers, with the majority of the complexes present in the monomeric form (Fig. 1,lane 3). The monomers appeared to have a slightly slower electrophoretic mobility than VN-TAT, which is most likely due to the fact than HCII is a larger protein than AT (Fig. 1,lane 3). Furthermore, there appeared to be more degradation products with VN-thrombin-HCII than seen with VN-TAT, which are of higher molecular mass than the VN-TAT degradation products. These lower molecular mass bands are most likely VN-thrombin-HCII degradation products, since they appear also to contain thrombin and VN. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of the purified VN-TAT preparation revealed that VN-HCII-thrombin complexes were a minor contaminant, since the preparation contained an approximately 10-fold molar excess of AT over HCII (data not shown). 125I-VN-TAT plasma clearance experiments were done in rabbits to determine whether VN-TAT is metabolized in a fashion similar to TAT. The mean of trichloroacetic acid-corrected125I-VN-TAT plasma clearance curves is shown in Fig. 2. VN-TAT was removed rapidly from the circulation with a t½α = 3.8 ± 0.5 min and had a t½β = 85.4 ± 4.3 min. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that VN-TAT remained intact within the circulation over the entire period of the experiment (data not shown). Fig. 2 also shows the clearance curves of human TAT and human AT. AT clearance was slow, with its disappearance from the plasma being linear over the entire experimental time frame. As expected, the clearance of AT was much slower than that of VN-TAT and TAT, with only ∼25% of the initially injected 125I-AT cleared at the 1-h point. Both VN-TAT and TAT had a biphasic clearance with a rapid phase of initial clearance. TAT had a slightly highert½α (5.3 ± 0.32 min) than VN-TAT (3.8 ± 0.5 min), although it is not significantly different (p = 0.088). TAT had a slower second clearance phase with a half-life (t½β) of 42.8 ± 3.7 min. To determine the organ localization of VN-TAT removal,125I-VN-TAT was injected into rabbits (n = 3), and after 1 h the post-mortem determination of radioactivity within different tissues was done. The organs examined were the liver, lungs, kidneys, spleen, bladder, and heart. Over 80% of the total organ-associated radioactivity was liver-associated (see Fig. 3 A). The kidney contained the next highest fraction of radioactivity (∼10% of the total). Examining the amount of radioactivity/g of tissue showed that the liver had the highest specific activity (∼20,000 cpm/g) (Fig. 3 B). Relatively high counts were found in the kidneys and spleen (∼14,000 cpm/g and ∼15,000 cpm/g, respectively). VN-TAT has been reported to interact with a heparin-like substance on the surface of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (28de Boer H.C. Preissner K.T. Bouma B.N. de Groot P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2264-2268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the binding of VN-TAT to liver receptors was also heparin-sensitive, the plasma clearance of VN-TAT was observed under competition conditions using standard heparin. Fig. 4 A shows the clearance curve of 125I-VN-TAT co-injected with a bolus of 10,000 units of heparin, with the previous 125I-VN-TAT clearance (without heparin) experiments as a reference. In the presence of heparin, the clearance data best approximated a single-compartment model, in which the initial rapid clearance phase with VN-TAT alone was abolished. The determined t½ from these experiments was 61.8 ± 3.7 min, which was significantly different from thet½β for VN-TAT alone of 85.4 ± 4.3 min (p = 0.002). The t½ of initially injected 125I-VN-TAT to clear from rabbits without heparin was ∼10 min. In further experiments, protamine sulfate was co-injected (final concentration, ∼500 μg/ml blood) with the 125I-VN-TAT. Like heparin, protamine sulfate abolished the α-phase of VN-TAT clearance and reduced the clearance pattern to a monophasic one. From Fig. 4 A, it can be seen that protamine, like heparin, decreased the clearance rate of VN-TAT in the plasma by approximately 5-fold compared with VN-TAT alone, with half of the total dose injected being cleared by 49.4 ± 4.4 min. To further determine the effects of heparin on 125I-VN-TAT clearance, varying doses of heparin were used. Fig. 4 Bdemonstrates the clearance of 125I-VN-TAT in the presence of 10,000 (taken from Fig. 4 A), 5,000, and 1,000 units of heparin or of saline control. In the presence of 10,000 units of heparin, 125I-VN-TAT clearance is monophasic. However, with decreasing doses of competing heparin, the clearance becomes more biphasic, such that the more rapid α-phase of clearance reappears, similar to that seen with 125I-VN-TAT alone. To determine whether heparin treatment affected the liver-specific clearance of VN-TAT, experiments were done in the absence and presence of heparin, with the amount of radioactivity within the livers examined at 30 min (n = 3) (data not shown). This time was chosen to maximize differences in VN-TAT removal. Comparing the amount of 125I-VN-TAT in the livers of the two groups revealed that ∼66% of cleared 125I-VN-TAT was found in the rabbit livers (n = 3). This clearance was reduced to only ∼39% in the heparin-treated animals (n = 2). Furthermore, there was 50% less radioactivity/g of liver tissue in the heparin-treated animals. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that the liver is the major site for VN-TAT removal and that heparin-like materials are important for VN-TAT clearance. Fig. 5 A shows the appearance of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in the plasmas of the rabbits injected with 125I-VN-TAT. There was an initial decrease in the trichloroacetic acid-soluble plasma 125I products, which most likely represents the clearance of free125I from the blood. At 20 min, the soluble plasma radioactivity began to increase, and it peaked at 60 min at a level 3 times greater than that seen initially in the plasma. This peak in appearance of 125I degradation products was maintained for up to 120 min. The degradation of 125I-VN-TAT co-injected with either heparin or protamine is shown in Fig. 5 B. The initial levels of trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts were very similar for up to 20 min for all three experimental groups and probably represent the clearance of free 125I. However, in the presence of protamine or heparin, the appearance of trichloroacetic acid-soluble degradation products barely exceeded (protamine) or did not exceed (heparin) the initial plasma levels of trichloroacetic acid-soluble products. The highest degradation levels were reduced >2.5-fold for VN-TAT competed with protamine or heparin compared with that seen with VN-TAT alone. 125I-TAT clearance was determined in the absence or presence of 10,000 units of heparin (Fig. 6 A). Similar to that seen with125I-VN-TAT clearance, the α-phase of125I-TAT clearance was greatly reduced in the presence of heparin. To determine if 125I-TAT complexes remained intact during clearance, plasma samples were analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6 B). The 125I-TAT complexes injected with saline remained intact and were cleared rapidly. However, the125I-TAT complexes in the heparin competition experiments partitioned as normal TAT complexes and as a high molecular mass adduct that appeared immediately (1 min time point) and persisted throughout the experiment. Furthermore, the disappearance of the two labeled species was reduced in comparison with the rapid clearance seen with125I-TAT alone. To determine the affinity of VN-TAT for HepG2 cells, a competitive radioligand binding experiment was performed. A competition curve from the data was obtained giving an IC50 value of ∼1 μm (Fig. 7 A), resulting in an apparent K d of ∼1 μm. In further competitive radioligand binding experiments, the ability of VN-TAT, TAT, and α2M* to compete for binding with 125I-VN-TAT was compared. Fig. 7 B shows"

Translation initiation can be considered to begin with the dissociation of 80 S ribosomes into free 40 S and 60 S subunits which then reassociate with mRNAs in a highly regulated and complex process. Initiation of cap-dependent translation in eukaryotes begins with the binding of a 43 S preinitiation complex to the 5′ cap of the mRNA. The 43 S ribosome migrates down the mRNA to the translation start site where it is joined by a 60 S ribosomal subunit to complete the assembly of an apparatus capable of accurately forming the first peptide bond. Translation initiation is mediated by at least 10 translation initiation factors, many of which contain multiple subunits that are conserved between yeast and mammals (reviewed in Refs. 1Merrick W.C.

This complex was shown to restore translation in a cell-free extract derived from a temperature-sensitive prt1-1 mutant. Interestingly, the complex contained a polypeptide of an apparent mass similar to Nip1p. We now show that Nip1p indeed co-purifies with Prt1p.NIP1 encodes an essential 93-kDa protein that localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm (17Gu Z. Moerschell R.P. Sherman F. Goldfarb D.S. Proc.

The nip1-1 allele was identified in a screen for mutants with defects in nuclear transport, and nip1-1 ts cells were defective in nuclear localization signal-directed nuclear transport (17Gu Z.

Analysis of nip1-1ts cells using a recently developed assay based on the nuclear import kinetics of nuclear localization signal-containing green fluorescent protein confirmed that the transport defect is temperature conditional (18Gu Z. Studies of Nuclear Transport and Function of NIP1 in the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Ph.D. Thesis. University of Rochester, Rochester, NY1995Google Scholar). Here, we show that Nip1p is likely to play an essential role in protein synthesis as a subunit of yeast eIF3.

Tif34p is required for cell cycle progression and mating as well as translation initiation (12Verlhac M.H. Chen R.H. Hanachi P. Hershey J.W.B. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6812-6822Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, Gcd10p and Sui1p do not show strong similarities to any human eIF3 subunits (13Hershey, J. W.

It has a RNA-binding domain which does not seem to be essential for function (12Verlhac M.H. Chen R.H. Hanachi P. Hershey J.W.B. Derynck R.

Sui1p is an essential protein identified genetically by its role in ribosomal recognition of the AUG start codon during scanning (7Yoon H. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Gcd10p is an essential RNA-binding protein first identified by its involvement in regulating translation initiation on GCN4 mRNA. BecauseGCN4 translation is coupled to the availability and utilization of the ternary complex containing eIF2, GTP, and tRNAiMet (15Dever T.E. Yang W. Astrom S. Bystrom A.S. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6351-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), these genetic findings implicated Gcd10p in the binding of ternary complexes to 40 S ribosomal subunits (10Garcia-Barrio M.T.

Human eIF3 contains a 66-kDa RNA-binding subunit that shares an epitope with Gcd10p (10Garcia-Barrio M.T. Naranda T. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Cuesta R. Hinnebusch A.G. Hershey J.W.B. Tamame M.

A different complex containing Prt1p was purified using reactivity against Prt1p antibodies as the means of detecting the protein (16Danaie P. Wittmer B. Altmann M. Trachsel H. J. Biol.

This complex was shown to restore translation in a cell-free extract derived from a temperature-sensitive prt1-1 mutant. Interestingly, the complex contained a polypeptide of an apparent mass similar to Nip1p. We now show that Nip1p indeed co-purifies with Prt1p. NIP1 encodes an essential 93-kDa protein that localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm (17Gu Z. Moerschell R.P. Sherman F. Goldfarb D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The nip1-1 allele was identified in a screen for mutants with defects in nuclear transport, and nip1-1 ts cells were defective in nuclear localization signal-directed nuclear transport (17Gu Z.

Analysis of nip1-1ts cells using a recently developed assay based on the nuclear import kinetics of nuclear localization signal-containing green fluorescent protein confirmed that the transport defect is temperature conditional (18Gu Z.

A highly conserved α-helix in the C-terminal regulatory domain of the tetrameric enzyme was previously implicated in effector binding and feedback inhibition. Double (447, 451) and triple (447, 451, 454) alanine replacements for the conserved amino acids leucine 447, leucine 451, and leucine 454 in this region yield enzyme variants that show increased sigmoidality in steady-state kinetics, and which are less sensitive to the allosteric modifiers isoleucine and valine.

Control of branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis in plants and microorganisms is achieved in part by biosynthetic threonine deaminase. Threonine deaminase (TD1; threonine dehydratase; l-threonine hydrolyase (deaminating), EC 4.2.1.16) (1Umbarger H.E. Neidhart F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 352-367Google Scholar) from Escherichia colicatalyzes the committed step in the biosynthesis of isoleucine, the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent conversion ofl-threonine to α-ketobutyrate, in a controlled fashion (1Umbarger H.E. Neidhart F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 352-367Google Scholar). The initial velocity of threonine deaminase follows a sigmoidal dependence on l-threonine concentration and is shifted in the presence of the end products isoleucine and valine. Isoleucine, which binds preferentially to the low activity T state of TD, is an allosteric inhibitor, resulting in an increase in the sigmoidality and the mid-point of saturation curves. Valine activates the enzyme by preferentially binding to the high activity R state, thereby giving rise to virtually hyperbolic kinetics, although it only slightly affects the apparent K 0.5 (2Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5801-5807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the structural similarity of these ligands, neither isoleucine nor valine show appreciable affinity for the active site of threonine deaminase. However, the affinity of l-threonine and its analogs for the regulatory sites is greater than that seen for the active site, which results in a synergistic effect on the allosteric transition. This effect can be treated by incorporating a provision into the classic two-state model of Monod et al. (3Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6129) Google Scholar) to account for the shift in the ratio of the T state to the R state upon substrate binding to effector sites (4Eisenstein E. Yu H.D. Fisher K.E. Iacuzio D.A. Ducote K.R. Schwarz F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9403-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A key issue in the regulation of allosteric enzymes concerns the manner whereby different feedback modifiers bind to the same regulatory site but yield dramatically different effects on enzyme kinetics and ligand binding (5Perutz M. Mechanisms of Cooperativity and Allosteric Regulation in Proteins. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1990Google Scholar). For example, activation by ATP and inhibition by CTP and UTP occurs by binding to the same sites on the regulatory chains of aspartate transcarbamoylase (6Wild J.R. Loughrey-Chen S.J. Corder T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 7Eisenstein E. Markby D.W. Schachman H.K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3724-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 8Stevens R.C. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6570-6576Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Zhang Y. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This is an especially significant problem for the regulation of threonine deaminase since the allosteric effectors isoleucine and valine are so structurally similar yet promote such dramatically different effects on the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Previous studies identified an interesting amino acid substitution, Leu447 → Phe, in a conserved region of the regulatory domain of the enzyme that resulted in a loss of feedback regulation through a defect in the allosteric transition (4Eisenstein E. Yu H.D. Fisher K.E. Iacuzio D.A. Ducote K.R. Schwarz F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9403-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In an effort to assess the role of this highly conserved region of the regulatory domain, multiple amino acid substitutions were introduced into this region in TD, and their effects on quaternary structure, effector binding, and the regulation of catalysis were investigated. Results for a double and triple mutant with reduced affinity for isoleucine and valine suggest that effectors bind to the same site in the regulatory domain of TD. Interestingly, the mutant enzymes show more sigmoidal saturation curves in steady-state kinetics and inhibitor binding to the active site, which suggests that l-threonine and its analogs also have reduced affinity for the regulatory site. These results provide support for a complex mechanism for regulation of wild-type threonine deaminase. Restriction enzymes, polymerases, and ligases were from New England BioLabs or Life Technologies, Inc. Isoleucine and valine were from Sigma, and l-α-aminobutyrate was from ICN Biomedicals. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 380 B synthesizer and purified by high performance liquid chromatography prior to use. Site-directed mutagenesis of E. coli ilvA was used to introduce multiple mutations into a highly conserved region of the regulatory domain of threonine deaminase. A double mutation in ilvA containing alanine substitutions for Leu447 and Leu451 was constructed and designated TDDBL. A variant with three substitutions including Leu447 → Ala, Leu451→ Ala, and Leu454 → Ala was also constructed, and designated TDTPL. Mutagenesis was performed with pEE27 as a single-stranded template (11Fisher K.E. Eisenstein E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6605-6613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the Sculptor IVM kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for mutagenesis reactions. The oligonucleotides that were synthesized to introduce the mutations into ilvA also introduced convenient sites for restriction endonucleases to facilitate screening. The mutants were verified by DNA sequencing using Sequenase version 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Double and triple mutants of TD were purified essentially as described previously for wild-type threonine deaminase (2Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5801-5807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29416-29422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of the mutations on the activity of threonine deaminase was assessed from measurements of the initial velocity versus l-threonine concentration using a continuous spectrophotometric assay for α-ketobutyrate (13Davis L. Anal. Biochemistry. 1965; 12: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Initial rates were determined in the absence and presence of 0.5 mm valine and 50 μm isoleucine. Additionally, the effect of increasing isoleucine and valine on the activity of the mutants was measured at low, fixed concentrations of threonine to obtain a preliminary estimate for the relative affinity of the mutants for isoleucine and valine. All the experiments were performed at 25 °C. Fluorescence spectra to detect ligand binding to TD variants were collected using a FluoroMax 2000 spectrofluorimeter from Spex Industries. An excitation wavelength of 295 nm was used to measure changes in the tryptophan emission spectrum upon effector site binding (14Eisenstein E. Yu H.D. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29423-29429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and an excitation wavelength of 400 nm was used to measure changes in the emission of pyridoxal phosphate upon active site ligation (12Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29416-29422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of concentrated stock solutions of isoleucine, valine, or α-aminobutyrate were added to 2.5 ml of a 100–200 μg/ml enzyme solution, which was stirred continuously at a constant 25 °C. Corrections to the spectra were made to account for background emission and enzyme dilution. The exchange of heat upon addition of isoleucine to wild-type TD and TDDBL was measured in a Microcal Omega titration calorimeter. The measurements were performed in 0.05 m potassium phosphate, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Microliter aliquots of a 10 mm isoleucine solution were added by a rotating stirrer-syringe to an enzyme solution containing 266 μm effector sites. Estimates for the average and stepwise enthalpies of isoleucine binding to TDDBL were made as described previously for the wild-type enzyme (14Eisenstein E. Yu H.D. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29423-29429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium was performed with a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Data in the form of absorbance versus radius were collected at 280 nm and 412 nm after reaching equilibrium, usually between 16 and 22 h. Data were analyzed using nonlinear least-squares analysis to assess for the effect of mutations on the quaternary structure of the tetramer. Analyses in terms of a single, homogeneous species were performed using equilibrium data usually obtained at three different protein concentrations, and also in the presence of isoleucine, valine, or α-aminobutyrate. All data were analyzed using nonlinear least-squares methods (15Johnson M.L. Fraser S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 301-342Crossref Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Sigmoidal ligand binding and enzyme kinetic data for the mutants were analyzed first by the Hill (16Hill A.V. J. Physiol. 1910; 40: iv-viiGoogle Scholar) equation to obtain empirical parameters. Because the apparent average affinity of a protein for a cooperatively binding ligand is dependent on the number of binding states and the energetic barriers between their interconversion, estimates for average apparent binding constants were obtained by analysis of equilibrium binding data in terms of an Adair (17Adair G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 63: 529-545Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) equation. This analysis was used as described previously in order to obtain estimates for stepwise and average binding energies (12Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29416-29422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Eisenstein E. Yu H.D. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29423-29429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stepwise binding energies were also used to extract the stepwise and average enthalpies of isoleucine binding to TDDBL from titration calorimetry data as described previously (14Eisenstein E. Yu H.D. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29423-29429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, enzyme kinetic data and active site ligand binding data were analyzed in terms of the two-state model (3Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6129) Google Scholar) to obtain the allosteric parametersL, K R, and c. The effects of the amino acid substitutions in the region of Leu447 in the regulatory domain were first assessed by examining the steady-state kinetics of TDDBLand TDTPL in the absence and presence of isoleucine and valine. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the values estimated for the maximal activities of TDDBL and TDTPL were similar to that for wild-type threonine deaminase. However, the velocities of the mutant enzymes displayed a markedly more sigmoidal dependence on the l-threonine concentration than does wild-type TD. Additionally, the mid-points of these curves are elevated compared with those of the wild type. Analysis of the kinetics data presented in Fig. 1 in terms of the Hill equation yields values for the n H of 2.2 and aK 0.5 of 18.7 mm for TDDBL, and an n H of 2.3 and aK 0.5 of 25.6 mm for TDTPL. Addition of 50 μm isoleucine or 0.5 mmvaline, saturating effector concentrations for wild-type threonine deaminase, resulted in almost no effect on the steady-state kinetics seen for TDDBL and TDTPL. As can be seen in Fig. 1, B and C, the sigmoidality of the saturation curves and their mid-points are roughly the same even in the presence of the heterotropic effectors. Although enzyme activation was undetectable even at millimolar concentrations of valine for either variant, feedback inhibition of TDDBL could be achieved by the addition of elevated concentrations of isoleucine. Steady-state kinetics with TDDBL performed in the presence of 100 μm isoleucine yielded an increasedK 0.5 of 30 mm, and the addition of 350 μm isoleucine resulted in nearly complete inhibition of the enzyme. Similar concentrations of isoleucine had little effect on TDTPL, however. Thus, the double and triple mutations in the vicinity of Leu447 result in enzyme variants that are significantly reduced in their sensitivity to feedback modifiers. A summary of the kinetic data for TDDBL and TDTPL, as well as the parameters for wild-type TD obtained under similar conditions, is presented in Table I.Table IEffects of isoleucine and valine on the steady-state kinetic parameters for regulatory domain mutants of threonine deaminaseEnzymeEffectorn HK 0.5V maxmmTDDBLNone2.218.7202Isoleucine2.223.2184Valine1.917.6191TDTPLNone2.125.6212Isoleucine1.827.3220Valine2.026.6213Wild type TDNone2.03.9206Isoleucine4.040.4188Valine1.03.4210The kinetic parameters are reported for experiments conducted in 0.05m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C.The Hill parameters were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” with 65% confidence intervals ranging from about 5% for the Hill coefficients, and between 10 and 20% for the values for V max and forK 0.5. Open table in a new tab The kinetic parameters are reported for experiments conducted in 0.05m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. The Hill parameters were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” with 65% confidence intervals ranging from about 5% for the Hill coefficients, and between 10 and 20% for the values for V max and forK 0.5. Because the previously isolated mutant TDL447F was found to bind heterotropic effectors strongly but was feedback-resistant because of defective allosteric communication (4Eisenstein E. Yu H.D. Fisher K.E. Iacuzio D.A. Ducote K.R. Schwarz F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9403-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it was of interest to examine the interaction of isoleucine and valine with TDDBL and TDTPL. Additionally, since the binding of feedback modifiers promotes significant changes in tryptophan fluorescence in wild-type threonine deaminase, this approach was initially employed to assess the interaction of isoleucine and valine with the variant enzymes. As can be seen in Fig. 2 A, the addition of millimolar levels of isoleucine and valine to TDDBL produced only a small, yet measurable, change in tryptophan fluorescence. By contrast, neither the addition of isoleucine nor of valine promoted any change in the tryptophan fluorescence of TDTPL. As can be seen in Fig. 2 B, the fluorescence spectra for TDTPL are virtually identical in the presence of either of the heterotropic effectors. 2The relative fluorescence of TDTPLis almost 2-fold greater that TDDBL at equivalent concentrations. This may be due to a quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp458 by Leu454, which is reduced by the Leu454 → Ala substitution. These two residues are in close proximity to one another at the end of helix 17 of the x-ray crystal structure of TD (23Gallagher D.T. Gilliland G.L. Xiao G. Zondlo J. Fisher K.E. Chinchilla D. Eisenstein E. Structure. 1998; 6: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). There was no significant effect of either isoleucine or valine on the fluorescence properties of the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor for either variant. Thus, one explanation for the reduced sensitivity of the two variants to feedback regulation may be attributable to defects in isoleucine and valine binding. The small fluorescence change in TDDBL at reasonable concentrations of isoleucine permitted an evaluation of its binding isotherm. As can be seen in Fig. 3, isoleucine binds cooperatively to TDDBL, with an average dissociation constant of 70 μm. Not only is the binding of isoleucine to TDDBL weaker than the wild type, but the isotherm is more sigmoidal. Thus, one effect of the mutations may be to slightly destabilize the T state of the enzyme, thereby reducing the value for the allosteric equilibrium constant and resulting in more cooperative isotherms for ligands that bind preferentially to the T state. No accurate information could be obtained for the affinity of valine to TDDBL, nor for the association of either isoleucine or valine for TDTPL, since any fluorescence changes were immeasurably small. Isothermal titration calorimetry was employed to corroborate the interpretation from the fluorescence binding experiments. As can be seen in Fig. 4, there was a significant release of heat from TDDBL upon addition of microliter aliquots of isoleucine. Analysis of the data indicates that 4 mol of isoleucine are bound per tetramer, and that the average enthalpy for isoleucine binding to TDDBL is −20.98 kcal/mol, about twice the value (−10.7 kcal/mol) seen for isoleucine binding to wild-type TD. Neither the addition of valine to TDDBL, nor isoleucine or valine to TDTPL, yielded sufficient heat exchange to estimate energetic parameters. Enzyme kinetic titrations were also used to estimate the affinity of isoleucine and valine to the TD variants. This approach, which relies on the effect of feedback modifiers to shift the activity of threonine deaminase at concentrations of substrate which are low enough that they do not significantly perturb the allosteric equilibrium, has yielded binding curves for wild-type enzyme that agree surprisingly well with other, more direct approaches (14Eisenstein E. Yu H.D. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29423-29429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 5 A, the isoleucine-promoted inhibition of TDDBL seen in enzyme assays performed at 20 mml-threonine exhibit a sigmoidal dependence on isoleucine concentration. Analysis of the data in terms of the Hill equation yields a K 0.5 of 78 μm, which in reasonable agreement with that determined by fluorescence and calorimetry. No increase in the activity of TDDBL was observed by the addition of valine. The fractional inhibition of TDTPL can be seen in Fig. 5 B. These assays were performed at a concentration of 25 mml-threonine, and the dependence of the inhibition on isoleucine concentration is markedly sigmoidal. Analysis of this isotherm in terms of the Hill equation yields aK 0.5 of 450 μm. As with TDDBL, there was no effect of valine on the activity of TDTPL at these l-threonine concentrations. Assuming that changes in enzyme activity are directly proportional to the fractional saturation of TD by allosteric effectors, these results indicate that the binding of isoleucine is decreased by roughly 20- and 100-fold in TDDBL and TDTPL, respectively, and that the affinity of valine for the mutants is negligible. Because the initial velocity curves seen for TDDBL and TDTPL appear more sigmoidal than typical curves for wild type, it was of interest to assess the effect of the amino acid substitutions on the cooperativity of active site ligand binding. A convenient approach to measure ligand binding to the active sites arises from the formation of an external aldimine Schiff base with amino acid substrates and analogs such as α-aminobutyrate, which results in a substantial increase in the fluorescence of the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor in threonine deaminase (12Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29416-29422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Eisenstein E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 6, TDDBL and TDTPL bind α-aminobutyrate cooperatively, with average dissociation constants of 25.7 and 33.6 mm, respectively. Analysis of cooperative ligand binding to the active sites of wild-type threonine deaminase is complicated by the higher affinity that substrates and analogs possess for the regulatory site. This complication can be circumvented by including a term in an expanded two-state allosteric model for substrate binding to both active sites and effector sites (4Eisenstein E. Yu H.D. Fisher K.E. Iacuzio D.A. Ducote K.R. Schwarz F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9403-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, for TDDBL and TDTPL, which possess virtually no affinity for valine, a simple two-state model can be used to analyze α-aminobutyrate binding data and, by assuming that initial velocity is proportional to fractional saturation, to the steady-state kinetics data withl-threonine as substrate. Analysis of the data in Figs. 1and 6 in terms of the simple two-state model yields a range of values for the allosteric equilibrium constant, L, of 55–80 for TDDBL, and 45–90 for TDTPL, as well as a range of values for K R of 11–16 for α-aminobutyrate and 7–9 for l-threonine. A summary of the allosteric parameters for the two mutant enzymes is presented in Table II.Table IIAllosteric parameters for cooperative active site ligand binding to regulatory domain mutants of threonine deaminase evaluated from a simple two-state modelEnzymeLigandLK RmmTDDBLl-Threonine787α-Aminobutyrate5411TDTPLl-Threonine929α-Aminobutyrate4616The allosteric parameters are reported for experiments conducted in 0.05 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C.The allosteric parameters were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” with 65% confidence intervals ranging from about 40% of the parameter value for L, and about 20% of the parameter value for K R.

Open table in a new tab The allosteric parameters are reported for experiments conducted in 0.05 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. The allosteric parameters were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” with 65% confidence intervals ranging from about 40% of the parameter value for L, and about 20% of the parameter value for K R.

Amino acid substitutions in a conserved region of the regulatory domain of threonine deaminase yielded mutant enzymes with dramatic alterations of heterotropic effector binding, and a smaller, but significant effect on the allosteric equilibrium between the T and the R states of the enzyme. These properties of the mutants have revealed some interesting clues about the allosteric regulation of threonine deaminase. The apparent affinity of TDDBL and TDTPL for isoleucine and valine, and the effect of these ligands on the enzymes, is markedly reduced. Spectroscopic (Fig. 3), calorimetric (Fig. 4), and activity titrations (Fig. 5) all yield apparent dissociation constants for isoleucine binding to TDDBL of 70–80 μm, about 15-fold weaker than is isoleucine binding to wild-type TD. The affinity of TDTPL for isoleucine appears much weaker and could only be estimated by the effect of the allosteric inhibitor on activity titrations (Fig. 5). Although these latter data rely on the assumption that the allosteric equilibrium is not shifted significantly in the presence of low concentrations of threonine, and that changes in TD activity are directly proportional to the fractional saturation of the enzyme with isoleucine, they enable an estimate for an apparent binding constant of about 450 μm, roughly 100-fold weaker than the wild type (14Eisenstein E. Yu H.D. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29423-29429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, valine binding is simply too weak to measure accurately by any of the methods for either TDDBL or TDTPL. Taken together, these data suggest that the feedback resistance of the mutants is primarily attributable to defects in effector binding. The small decreases seen for the allosteric equilibrium constants for the mutants also make a contribution to their feedback-resistant properties, however. Additionally, the reduction in the apparent affinity for heterotropic ligands resulting from the small cluster of mutations suggests that both isoleucine and valine bind to a similar region, if not the same site, in the regulatory domain of TD. Although the substituted amino acids fall within the same, conserved helix in the regulatory domain, it is unclear at the current resolution of the unligated structure of TD how they all contribute to effector binding or how isoleucine and valine binding can promote such dramatic differences in the activity of the enzyme. 3D. T. Gallagher and D. Chinchilla, personal communication. Inspection of the isoleucine binding isotherms for TDDBLand TDTPL suggests that in addition to the weaker binding of heterotropic effectors, the T state has been destabilized relative to the R state for these variants. This is reflected in the greater sigmoidality of the isotherms, which suggests a greater population of R state molecules relative to wild-type TD. Additionally, isoleucine binding to TDDBL occurs with a large negative average enthalpy of about −21 kcal/mol (Fig. 4). This value is almost double that of −10.7 kcal/mol seen for isoleucine binding to wild-type TD, which is predominantly in the T state (14Eisenstein E. Yu H.D. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29423-29429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as that of −11.3 kcal/mol for the enthalpy of isoleucine binding to TDL447F, a mutational variant that is stabilized completely in the R state (4Eisenstein E. Yu H.D. Fisher K.E. Iacuzio D.A. Ducote K.R. Schwarz F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9403-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, if the binding enthalpies of isoleucine to the T and the R states are roughly equivalent, then the large negative enthalpy change seen for isoleucine binding to TDDBL reflects not only ligand binding, but also a favorable enthalpic component for the transition from the R state to the T-stabilized form of the enzyme, and predicts that the T → R transition occurs with a positive enthalpy change. In addition to the measurable effects of the amino acid substitutions on the apparent affinity for isoleucine and valine, the variants also manifest changes in active site ligand binding isotherms. However, this would not be unexpected. If l-threonine was unable to interact with the activator sites, it could not perturb the allosteric equilibrium, and a more sigmoidal saturation curve than wild type might be expected since the R state would be less populated at low substrate concentrations. This is, in fact, seen for both TDDBL and TDTPL in both enzyme kinetics using l-threonine (Fig. 1), and in the binding of the inhibitor α-aminobutyrate (Fig. 6). Moreover, this interpretation is qualitatively consistent with the fact that these ligands do not possess measurable affinity for the effector sites as seen in fluorescence assays. This is in sharp contrast to wild-type TD, which displays an increase in fluorescence at 343 nm (attributable to Trp458) 4H.-D. Yu, D. Porter, J. Knutson, and E. Eisenstein, unpublished observations. when substrates or analogs bind to the effector sites (14Eisenstein E. Yu H.D. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29423-29429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the isotherms for l-threonine and α-aminobutyrate only reveal cooperativity parameters for active site ligand binding, and there is no need to invoke the expanded two-state model previously developed for wild-type threonine deaminase to analyze cooperative active site ligand binding. It is necessary to analyze with cooperative ligand binding to the active sites of wild-type threonine deaminase by an expanded two-state model in order to obtain accurate values for L, the allosteric equilibrium constant (4Eisenstein E. Yu H.D. Fisher K.E. Iacuzio D.A. Ducote K.R. Schwarz F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9403-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This model, which is based on the tenets of the simple two-state model of Monod et al. (3Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6129) Google Scholar), can account for the relatively high affinity binding of substrates and analogs to the effector sites of TD, which results in an additional shift in the allosteric equilibrium in the direction of the R state as active site saturation is measured. However, because TDDBLand TDTPL possess significantly weaker affinity for ligands to their effector sites, it is unnecessary to invoke the expanded two-state model for analyses of cooperative active site ligand binding to the variants. Analysis of active site ligand binding to TDDBL and TDTPL in terms of a simple two-state model (3Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6129) Google Scholar) yields values for L of between 80 and 90 from enzyme kinetics, and between 45 and 55 from α-aminobutyrate binding (Table II). These values are somewhat lower than those for wild-type TD, which fall around 1500 as evaluated by the expanded model (4Eisenstein E. Yu H.D. Fisher K.E. Iacuzio D.A. Ducote K.R. Schwarz F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9403-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, they are significantly greater than the estimates of 1–10 for wild-type TD that are obtained when substrate and inhibitor binding to the effector sites is not taken into account (12Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29416-29422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, analysis of the binding and kinetic data for TDDBL and TDTPL in terms of a simple two-state model yield excellent fits, which display no signs of the systematic errors that are seen for wild-type data when analyzed in this way. Finally, since the TDL447F mutant is completely stabilized in the R state, and the calorimetric data on TDDBL suggests that another effect of these amino acid substitutions is to slightly destabilize the T state of the enzyme, the lower estimates of L for TDDBL and TDTPL seem reasonable. Early studies on threonine deaminase suggested several possible complex mechanisms for allosteric control of substrate binding and catalysis based on ligand competition studies (19Umbarger H.E. Adv. Enzymol. 1973; 37: 349-395PubMed Google Scholar, 20Decedue C.J. Hofler J.G. Burns R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1563-1570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hofler J.G. Burns R.O. J.

More recently, direct binding measurements on mutant enzymes with altered regulatory properties have indicated a pattern of regulation in which substrates (and inhibitors) shift the allosteric equilibrium by binding to the effector site and simulating the action of valine-activated enzyme (4Eisenstein E. Yu H.D. Fisher K.E. Iacuzio D.A. Ducote K.R. Schwarz F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9403-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A common feature of these proposals is that substrates bind to the effector sites on TD, which necessarily complicate any analysis of active site ligand binding. Because the two variants described here possess altered effector binding properties, they should be quite useful in studies aimed at probing the role of amino acid residues in the affinity for substrates, and also in promoting the allosteric transition of the enzyme solely through homotropic interactions. We greatly appreciate the help of Kathryn E. Fisher in the design and construction of the mutational variants used in this study."

Members of the EF-hand family of calcium-binding proteins regulate the interaction of proteins in a wide variety of cellular processes, from cell cycle progression to muscle contraction (1Means A.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 2Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In particular, troponin C (TnC),1 the major regulatory protein in striated muscle contraction, is the calcium-binding component of the ternary troponin complex. It regulates the actomyosin activity in a calcium-dependent manner, through its association with tropomyosin and actin. Since TnC does not interact directly with either of these proteins, it must transmit the calcium signal to the thin filament by its interaction with the other two components of the troponin complex, troponin I (TnI) and troponin T (TnT). TnI, the inhibitory subunit, inhibits the actomyosin ATPase and binds actin, while TnT binds tropomyosin. Because TnC is dependent on TnI and TnT for transmission of the calcium signal to the actin filament, studying the protein-protein interactions of TnC is critical to understanding the function of this molecule. We investigated the characteristics of peptides that interact with TnC using a phage-displayed combinatorial peptide library.

In this publication, we describe the affinity selection of a phage-displayed library of random 12-mers with immobilized rabbit fast skeletal TnC, and the isolation of novel sequences which bind TnC. The sequences have a consensus motif of (V/L)(D/E)XLKXXLXXLA, and are similar to a sequence within the region of TnI, which is believed to play a role in the calcium-dependent interaction with TnC (15Ngai S.

We have shown that TnC-selected peptides from a phage-displayed library and similar sequences from TnI bind TnC in a specific and biologically relevant manner. The 12-mer random peptide library was constructed as described (18Adey N.B. Sparks A.B. Beasley J. Kay B.K. Kay B.K. Winter J. McCafferty J. Phage Display of Peptides and Protein Domains: A Laboratory Manual. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 68-78Google Scholar) to yield 109 different recombinant M13 phage, which were plate-amplified to generate the library. TnC was purified either from rabbit muscle as described (20Brandt P.W. Diamond M.S. Schachat F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or following bacterial expression by Phenyl-Sepharose chromatography as described by George et al. (21George S.E. VanBerkum M.F. Ono T. Cook R. Hanley R.M. Putkey J.A. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9228-9235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity selection of the 12-mer library was used to isolate peptides that bound TnC as described (19Adey N.B. Guo R. Hanson H.L. Rider J.E. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 6: 34-45Google Scholar). Briefly, rabbit fast skeletal TnC was immobilized on polystyrene microtiter plates, and nonspecific binding was blocked by adding bovine serum albumin (BSA). After three rounds of affinity purification, TnC binding phage were eluted with 50 μl of 50 mmglycine·HCl (pH 2.0) and neutralized with 50 μl of 200 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4). Recovered phage were plated, and individual plaques isolated from bacterial lawns. The DNA of isolates was prepared from overnight liquid cultures with QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kits (Chatsworth, CA), and the culture supernatants were stored at 4 °C for confirmation of TnC binding activity (22Sparks A.B. Adey N.B. Quilliam L.A. Thorn J.M. Kay B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 498-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). DNA was sequenced with an oligonucleotide primer upstream of the gene III cloning site of the M13 vector m663 (23Fowlkes D.M. Adams M.D. Fowler V.A. Kay B.K. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 422-428PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides, corresponding to sequences from native TnI isoforms and sequences displayed by TnC-selected phage, were synthesized by the Peptide Synthesis Facility at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC. The C termini of the peptides were amidated, and a four-residue linker (GSGS) was added at their N termini prior to biotinylation. The sequences included: pT3, biotin-GSGSSRVDELKLKLSTLVSR-NH2; pT5, biotin-GSGSSRLDYLKSSLLHLGSR-NH2; hcTnI, biotin-GSGSSRKLQLKTLLLQIAKQ-NH2; msTnI, biotin-GSGSARRQHLKSVMLQIAAT-NH2; dTnIA, biotin-GSGSERKKKLRLLRKKAAE-NH2; dTnIV, biotin-GSGSERKKKLRLLLRKKVAE-NH2; APC, biotin-PKRHSGSYLVTSV-NH2; Amp1, biotin-GSGSAPTPPKRSSSF-NH2. Inserts of phage clones T3 and T5 (φT3 and φT5) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with primers upstream and downstream of the M13 gene III sequence, double-digested withXhoI and XbaI, and gel-purified. The bacterial alkaline phosphatase (AP) fusion vector, pMY101 (24Yamabhai M. Kay B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), was digested withXbaI and SalI, gel-purified, ligated to M13 phage inserts, and the ligation products used to transform electrocompetent DH5αF′ cells. DNA was prepared as above from cultures of individual colonies, and recombinants identified by diagnostic digestion withSalI and confirmed by DNA sequencing. AP fusion proteins were prepared by growing recombinants in liquid culture with ampicillin selection to an optical density (600 nm wavelength) of 0.3, addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 18 h. The conditioned medium was recovered by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min. Microtiter wells were coated with 50 ng of rabbit fast skeletal TnC or 50 ng of bovine brain calmodulin (CaM; Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., La Jolla, CA) in 100 mmNaHCO3 (pH 8.5) overnight at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 1% BSA in 100 mmNaHCO3 (pH 8.5) for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBST). The peptides were added to the blocked wells in a 25-μl volume (for a total reaction volume of 50 μl) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. For monovalent binding assays, 25 μl of 20 ng/μl streptavidin-linked alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) was added to the microtiter wells following the binding reaction and incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature, followed by multiple washes with PBST. To detect bound peptides, 50 μl of alkaline phosphatase buffer (1 m diethanolamine (pH 9.8), 1.0 mmMgCl2, 40 μm ZnSO4, 6.5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate) was added to each well and incubated 10 min at 37 °C to allow for full color development. The optical density of the wells was then measured at 405 nm with a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Protein was adsorbed to microtiter plates as described above. For AP fusion binding assays, 50 μl of conditioned medium was added to 50 μl of 100 μm CaCl2 in PBST in blocked wells and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. For competition assays, 100 μl of conditioned medium and 100 μl of competitor were added to the blocked wells and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The wells were washed repeatedly with PBST. Bound AP fusion proteins were detected by the addition of 56 μl of alkaline phosphatase buffer, followed by measurement of optical density at 405 nm with a microplate spectrophotometer. Equilibrium binding affinities of TnC for both library-derived and native TnI peptide sequences were determined by measurements of surface plasmon resonance (25Morelock M.M. Ingraham R.H. Betageri R. Jakes S. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) on a BIAcore™ 2000 instrument (Biacore AB). The technique of surface plasmon resonance for characterization of macromolecular interactions has been discussed in several reviews (26Myszka D. Curr. Opin.

In brief, ligands are attached to a carboxymethylated dextran gold surface and analytes are injected over the peptide surface. Binding is measured as an increase in resonance units (RU). Immunopure NeutrAvidin (Pierce)-coated CM5 sensor chips (BIAcore™, Inc.) were prepared to capture the biotinylated peptides onto the surface. NeutrAvidin was dissolved at 1 mg/ml in HBS buffer (20 mm HEPES, 3.4 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% P-20, pH 7.4), and diluted 1:20 in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0. NeutrAvidin was then covalently attached to the carboxyl groups on the surface of the CM5 sensor chip activated with 200 mm1-ethyl-3-[3-demethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride and 50 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide. Following 10 injections of 100 mm HCl (2-min contact time) over the NeutrAvidin-coated chip to achieve a stable base line, biotinylated peptides were immobilized by one or two injections of 100 nm peptide solution. After injection of 10 mmHCl to remove unbound peptide, final surface densities of between 75 and 125 RU resulted. To measure equilibrium binding affinities, increasing concentrations of TnC or calmodulin were injected over the peptide surface. Running buffer was HBS supplemented with 100 μm CaCl2in place of EDTA. Injection volumes were 60 μl at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The steady state binding levels, in RU, were recorded at the end of the injection. The surface was regenerated with 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 (2-min contact time). Binding to a control peptide, Amp1, 2Amp1, whose sequence is given under “Experimental Procedures,” is an SH3 domain-binding sequence from c-Abl. was also measured. These values were used to subtract nonspecific interactions. Background corrected RU values were plotted as a function of added TnC or calmodulin concentration, and nonlinear regression analysis (29Bevington P.R. Robinson D.K.

Purified TnC (6.7 μm) was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with pT5 (6.7, 13.4, and 33.5 μm), human cardiac TnI (6.7 and 13.4 μm), or Amp1 peptide (6.7, 13.4, and 33.5 μm). Samples were then diluted with 1.5 volumes of 41.5 mm Tris, 133 mm glycine (pH 8.6), 2 mm dithoithreitol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 16.7% glycerol, and 10 mmCaCl2. Samples were analyzed in 8% native gels containing 25 mm Tris, 80 mm glycine (pH 8.6), 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 10% glycerol. The activation and relaxing solutions and the procedure for isolation of skinned fibers are described by Brandt et al. (32Brandt P.W. Cox R.N. Kawai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4717-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pCa 8 relaxing solution contains (as sodium salts): 9.8 mmEGTA, 0.2 mm CaEGTA, 5 mm MgATP, 5 mm ATP, 7.5 PO4, 40.1 mmpropionate, 17.2 mm SO4, 10 mm MOPS at pH 7.00. The pCa 4.75 activating solution contains: 10 mm CaEGTA, 5 mm MgATP, 5 mm free ATP, 10 mm MOPS, 7.5 mm PO4, propionate, and SO4 to adjust the final solution to a standard ionic strength of 0.200 and monovalent cation concentration of 155 mm. Single fibers were isolated from bundles of rabbit psoas muscle skinned at 0 °C in skinning saline (5 mmK2H2EGTA, 2 mmNa2MgATP, 5 mmNa2K2ATP, 130 mm potassium propionate, 5 mm imidazole at pH 7.0). The maximal tension data were collected on an apparatus as described previously (32Brandt P.W. Cox R.N. Kawai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4717-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In an effort to study the peptide ligand preferences of TnC, we screened a phage display combinatorial peptide library with TnC. The library expressed random peptides 12 amino acids in length at the N terminus of bacteriophage M13 protein III. Immobilized rabbit fast skeletal TnC was used to affinity purify TnC-binding phage from the library. After three rounds of selection, isolated clones were tested for binding to TnC; approximately 90% of the isolates exhibited strong TnC binding activity in an ELISA-based assay. DNA sequences from isolated clones identified 10 unique TnC-binding peptides (Fig. 1). Alignment of these sequences yields a consensus motif of (V/L)(D/E)XLKXXLXXLA, whereX represents positions that have no apparent conservation. On the basis of these alignment data, we concluded that residues at insert positions 4, 5, and 11 were the most critical for binding to troponin C, since they were the most highly conserved. In in vitro phage binding assays, phage clones T3 and T5 (φT3 and φT5) exhibited the strongest TnC binding activity. Alignments of these peptide sequences (including the fixed serine and arginine residues from the M13 pIII protein) to known TnC ligands, namely TnI, TnT, and actin, revealed 50–60% similarity to sequences in the N-terminal regions of human cardiac and mouse skeletal TnI (Fig. 2).Figure 2Native TnI isoforms are similar to peptides displayed by TnC-selected phage. Alignment of peptide sequence displayed by φT5 (pT5) with native TnI isoforms. Human cardiac TnI-(44–59) exhibits 37.5% identity and 56.25% similarity to pT5; mouse fast skeletal TnI-(13–28) exhibits 31.25% identity and 62.5% similarity to pT5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies have shown that in addition to the well characterized interaction of the C-terminal TnI-inhibitory peptide with TnC, there are also important interactions between the N-terminal region of TnI with TnC. Based on the similarity between TnC-selected peptides and sequences in the N-terminal region of TnI, we hypothesized that the corresponding native sequences were sufficient for interaction with TnC. This reasoning was supported by studies which have shown that peptides from this region of TnI can bind TnC and can compete the release of acto-S1-Tm ATPase inhibition by TnC (15Ngai S. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15715-15720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Katayama E. Nozaki S. J. Biochem. (Toyko). 1982; 91: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is also notable that one of the best characterized non-lethal indirect flight mutations in Drosophila melanogaster, heldup,2 is due to a single alanine to valine mutation at codon 55 in the homologous N-terminal region of Drosophila TnI (33Beall C.J. Fyrberg E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 941-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Prado A. Canal I. Barbas J.A. Molloy J. Ferrus A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1433-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To facilitate characterization of the displayed sequences, biotinylated peptides were synthesized corresponding to the sequences displayed by TnC-selected phage clones (Fig. 1), and are hereafter denoted as pT3 and pT5. Due to their similarity to displayed peptides, sequences from the N-terminal region of native TnI isoforms were also synthesized as biotinylated peptides. The native peptides included human cardiac TnI-(44–59) (hcTnI), mouse fast skeletal TnI-(13–28) (msTnI) and both normal (dTnIA) and mutant (dTnIV) Drosophila flight muscle TnI-(42–57) (Fig. 2 B). To evaluate relative binding strength and specificity, the peptides were assayed for direct binding to immobilized BSA, rabbit fast skeletal TnC, and CaM (Fig. 3). Both of the library-derived peptides bound TnC above background and exhibited very little binding to CaM, a TnC-related protein. All four TnI-derived sequences bound TnC, with hcTnI, dTnIA, and dTnIV exhibiting the most robust binding signals. Binding to CaM was pronounced for hcTnI, dTnIA, and dTnIV, but was very low for msTnI. These data show that TnC-selected peptides from a phage library can bind TnC specifically, and that similar sequences from the N-terminal region of TnI isoforms can also bind TnC. To confirm binding of the library-derived sequences, and to determine whether the biotinylated peptides could compete binding to TnC, insert sequences from φT3 and φT5 were expressed as bacterial alkaline phosphatase fusions using the vector pMY101 (24Yamabhai M. Kay B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Assays of direct binding to TnC showed that both fusion proteins bound TnC specifically (Fig. 4 A), confirming that the library-derived sequences were bona fide binders. The fusion with highest binding activity, pT5AP, was used to assay the ability of the biotinylated peptides to compete TnC binding activity (Fig. 4 B). The pT5AP fusion was most easily competed by pT5, with an approximate IC50 of 300 nm, followed by hcTnI, pT3, and msTnI. These results agreed with the relative binding strengths determined by peptide ELISA (Fig. 3). The competition data provide evidence that the peptides are binding at, or near, the same site on TnC. Surface plasmon resonance was used to determine equilibrium dissociation constants for native and library-derived peptides. After biotinylated peptides were immobilized on an avidin-coupled sensor chip, increasing concentrations of TnC and CaM were injected over the immobilized peptides in the presence of calcium, and steady state binding was measured in RU. Regeneration of the peptide-coated sensor chips with EDTA resulted in a complete loss of TnC binding, which indicates that the association requires the presence of calcium. Background-corrected RU values were plotted as a function of increasing TnC or CaM (Fig. 5), and equilibrium dissociation constants for each peptide (Table I) were determined from the response data; pT5 had the lowest K d at 0.43 μm, followed by hcTnI at 0.86 μm, and pT3 at 6.1 μm. The K d of msTnI could not be measured accurately, presumably because saturating conditions could not be achieved. These dissociation constants correspond roughly to the relative and approximate IC50s measured by AP fusion competition assay (Fig. 4). Only the hcTnI peptide exhibited a detectable response to increasing CaM; however, itsK d was 6 μm. These data confirm that in the presence of calcium the library-derived peptides bind TnC specifically and can exhibit dissociation constants higher than those of the corresponding TnC sequences.Table IEquilibrium binding constants of troponin C-binding peptidesPeptideSequenceBinding constantμmpT5SRLDYLKSSLLHLGSR0.43hcTnISRKLQLKTLLLQIAKQ0.86pT3SRVDELKLKLSTLVSR6.1msTnIARRQHLKSVMLQIAAT501-aThis value is approximate, as the binding constant is probably near or above the limits of the BIAcore™ 2000 (see BIAcore 2000 Instrument Handbook, p.

Head and Perry (35Head J.F. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1974; 137: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) initiated the use of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to demonstrate stable interactions between TnI and TnC, and others have used similar techniques to analyze the interaction of TnI peptides with TnC (15Ngai S. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15715-15720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Katayama E. Nozaki S. J. Biochem. (Toyko). 1982; 91: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 17Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. da Silva A.C. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of pT5 with TnC was conducted using the modification of Farah et al. (17Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. da Silva A.C. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified TnC was mixed with pT5, and the products of the binding reactions were resolved by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 6). In the presence of calcium, pT5 associates with TnC in a stable manner, as indicated by the presence of a lower mobility band and a reduced concentration of free TnC. Full-length TnI also associates with TnC in a stable manner, as indicated by the presence of bands with reduced mobility and a reduction in the concentration of free TnC. The negative control peptide, Amp1, does not associate with TnC, as indicated by the absence of bands with reduced mobility and the presence of large amounts of free TnC. Similar results were observed in experiments performed with radioactively labeled TnC, generated by transcription-coupled translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (results not shown). These results taken together demonstrate that the TnC-selected pT5 forms a stable complex with TnC in the presence of calcium. The physiological consequences of naturally occurring TnC-binding peptides have been studied by determining their effects on maximal calcium-induced tension in skinned muscle fibers. The ability of pT5 to disrupt activation of the troponin complex was assessed by measuring its effect on maximal calcium-activated tension in skinned rabbit psoas fibers. Addition of the pT5 peptide to the pCa 4.75 activating solution inhibited maximal calcium tension. As shown in the tension trace in Fig. 7, the maximal tension is reduced by 11, 38, and 66% at pT5 concentrations of 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mm, respectively. Studies on six fibers showed that a 1 mm solution of pT5 reduces maximal tension by 59.5 ± 3.4% (average ± S.E.). Under the same conditions, the negative control peptide APC has no effect on maximal calcium-activated tension. The effect of pT5 is fully reversible, as indicated by the recovery of maximal activated calcium tension following removal of the pT5 solution, washing of the fiber in pCa 8 relaxing solution, and reactivation. These results show that pT5 binds TnC in a biologically relevant manner by demonstrating that it is capable of disrupting the activation function of the troponin complex. In this study, we describe the affinity selection of phage-displayed random peptide library with TnC, and the isolation of 10 distinct sequences that bind TnC with a consensus of (V/L)(D/E)XLKXXLXXLA. Comparison of these sequences with other TnC-binding proteins revealed a striking similarity to a sequence within the N-terminal region of TnI. We have demonstrated that TnC-selected peptides from the phage-displayed library and similar sequences from TnI bind TnC specifically, with binding constants as low as 0.43 μm. In addition, we have shown that a TnC-selected peptide forms a stable complex with TnC in the presence of Ca2+. When further ELISA studies were performed to determine whether the binding of TnC-selected peptides to rabbit fast skeletal TnC was calcium-dependent (data not shown), we found that the binding of library-selected peptides and the mouse skeletal TnI peptide (msTnI) appeared to be calcium-dependent, while the binding of peptides from human cardiac TnI (hcTnI) and Drosophila TnI (dTnIA, dTnIV) appeared to be calcium-independent. We also demonstrated that a TnC-selected peptide binds TnC in a biologically relevant manner, as demonstrated by its inhibitory effect on calcium-induced tension generation in skinned muscle fibers. Addition of a 1 mm solution of pT5 resulted in a reduction in maximal tension of approximately 60%. Although the concentration of pT5 necessary to cause the reduction is much higher than its dissociation constant for TnC, it is important to realize that there are many stabilizing interactions among the subunits of the troponin complex. This peptide is homologous to only a portion of the regulatory peptide (Rp) of TnI, and x-ray crystallographic studies on the TnC-regulatory protein complex indicate will that pT5 will only disrupt interactions between TnI and the structural C-terminal domain of TnC (36Vassylyev D. Takeda S. Wakatsuki S. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4847-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This most likely explains why a small peptide, like pT5, requires a high concentration to impair the troponin activation in situ. Taken together, these results demonstrate the power of using phage-displayed combinatorial libraries to map native protein-protein interactions (3Cortese R. Monaci P. Nicosia A. Luzzago A. Felici F.

Drug Discovery Design. 1995; 2: 251-268Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The results also implicate that this short N-terminal sequence within TnI plays an important role in the interaction of TnC and TnI in vivo, which is supported by the results of previous studies on the interaction of TnC and TnI. The majority of previously published studies on the interaction of TnC and TnI have concentrated on the TnI inhibitory peptide (Ip), which consists of the C-terminal residues 104–115 of TnI. Several different groups have demonstrated that proteolytic fragments and synthetic peptides of the inhibitory region of TnI mimic the activity of TnI in their ability to inhibit the actomyosin ATPase activity and bind TnC resulting in the release of inhibition (16Katayama E.

In recent years, however, a number of studies have also been done on the function of the N-terminal region of TnI. Farah et al. (17Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. da Silva A.C. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Ngai and Hodges (15Ngai S. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15715-15720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that addition of peptides from the N-terminal region of TnI (TnI-(1–40), TnI-(10–40), and TnI-(20–40)) can prevent TnC from fully releasing the inhibition of actomyosin ATPase induced by TnI or Ip, although the N-terminal peptides do not directly inhibit actomyosin ATPase activity. In addition, both groups have demonstrated that peptides from the N-terminal region of TnI, namely the Rp (residues 1–40) and TnI-(1–98), can form stable complexes with TnC in the presence of calcium. 3Ngai and Hodges (15Ngai S. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15715-15720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) claim that interaction of Rp and TnC is Ca2+-dependent, based on the evidence that they do not form a complex in the absence of Ca2+, but Farah et al. (17Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. da Silva A.C. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have found that TnI-(1–98) and TnC can form a complex in the presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+. The results of these studies have led to the hypothesis that the N-terminal region of TnI is responsible for the structural interaction with TnC. Furthermore, Katayama and Nozaki (16Katayama E. Nozaki S. J. Biochem. (Toyko). 1982; 91: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a short synthetic peptide, consisting of residues 10–25 of the N-terminal region of rabbit fast skeletal TnI, could form a stable complex with TnC in the presence of Ca2+. Taken along with our findings that a synthetic peptide consisting of residues 13–28 of mouse fast skeletal TnI binds TnC, and that a similar TnC-selected peptide can form a stable complex with TnC in the presence of Ca2+, it is reasonable to suspect that the minimal sequence necessary for the interaction of the N-terminal region of TnI and TnC is bounded by these two native peptide sequences. In addition, we believe that we may have identified residues within the N-terminal region of TnI critical for binding to TnC, as they were highly conserved in the library-derived peptides. These results can be extended in the future by mutagenesis of these conserved residues within TnI, as well as performing a systematic scan of peptides spanning this region of TnI, and testing their binding to TnC. The peptides produced in this study will also serve as useful reagents to study the interaction of the N terminus of TnI with truncated forms of TnC to determine where the peptides are binding to TnC."
