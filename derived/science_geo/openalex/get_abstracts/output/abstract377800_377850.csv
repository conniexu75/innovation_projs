https://openalex.org/W2074690344,"IN the apple, fruit size and shape are known to be closely correlated with the number and position of the fertile seeds, an observation which suggests that the developing seed may be the source of a hormone which initiates and controls the growth of the fruit. Experimental evidence supporting this has recently been obtained for the apple variety Crawley Beauty, from the young seeds of which it has been found possible to prepare extracts which are active in stimulating the development of unfertilized tomato ovaries."

https://openalex.org/W1992578615,"ANEURIN disulphide1, formed by opening of the thiazole ring and oxidation to the—S—S—form, does not give the thiochrome reaction, unless suitably reduced by cysteine; it was reported to have some 60 per cent of the biological activity of aneurin, when given orally to animals. I have found in catatorulin tests, by methods previously described2, with the deficient pigeon brain that it is at least as active as aneurin (Table 1)."

https://openalex.org/W1974817949,"BARRON et al.1 showed that ascorbic acid is not autoxidizable in acid solutions up to pH 7. They investigated the catalytic effect of salts of manganese, nickel, iron, cobalt, calcium and copper at pH 4–6 and found that copper alone had a marked catalytic effect. Mack and Kertesz2 found that iron had no catalytic effect alone but increased the catalytic effect of copper."
https://openalex.org/W1999809423,"THE name ‘aspergillin’ has been applied to at least four different antibiotic substances from species of Aspergillus. Bush and Goth used the name at first1 for a compound from A. flavus which they later named flavicin2, and which, when investigated by Fried and co-workers3 under the name of flavicidin, ultimately appeared to be a double-bonded isomer of penicillin F."

https://openalex.org/W1971135289,"IT has been long observed that hypochlorite liquor, freshly prepared by electrolysis of brine using carbon electrodes, possesses characteristic oxidizing properties distinct from chlorine water or from sodium hypochlorite prepared by the passage of chlorine into caustic soda solution. Masterman1 made an extensive survey of the possible differences, and, using tetra-methyl. base, showed that electrolytic hypochlorite produced quite a different range of dyestuff colours from either of the other two chlorine agents. He suggested that this might be due to the presence of ozone in the electrolysed solution, since a similar colour reaction is given by that substance."

https://openalex.org/W1976548283,"IN a communication in Nature1, Webster and Frey have reported changes in the morphology of the Bacillus fusiformis found in cases of ulcerative gingivitis after the application of penicillin. The organisms had developed central round or spindle-shaped swellings. In an investigation of tropical ulcer in Madras, I have, however, noted in smears from untreated cases similar changes in the morphology of the fusiform bacillus. The central swelling is seen both by dark-ground illumination and after staining. It would appear, therefore, that the changes in morphology are due to the influence of other factors besides any specific treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2042482607,"ON Octobeer 4: the King, in presence of the Queemuicird, Chancellor of the University of Giles Gilbert Scott, architect of the buils rala distinguished Oxford gathering, open the new Library which has been erected at the corner of Broad Street and the Parks Road. The cost has been about £660,000, much of which was generously given to the University by the Rockefeller Trustees. Work on the building started in December 1936, and in the summer of 1937 the foundation-stone was laid by Queen Mary. The building was finished in 1940? and, but for the War, would have been formally opened in June of that year."

https://openalex.org/W2076423978,"IN a previous communication1, I reported that sodium enters the aqueous humor predominantly by secretion. This implies either : (i) that practically no ultra-filtration at all takes place from the vessels of the iris and ciliary body; or (ii) that the amount of sodium entering the aqueous by secretion greatly exceeds the amount entering by ultra-filtration, even if ultra-filtration still supplies a considerable part of the fluid volume of the aqueous."
