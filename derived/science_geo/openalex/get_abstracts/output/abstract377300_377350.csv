https://openalex.org/W2004791516,"IT has been established that human plasma contains an active fibrinolytic and proteolytic enzyme (plasmin), its inactive precursor (plasminogen), and also an inhibitor (antiplasmin) that normally over-neutralizes the enzyme1,2. Plasmin and plasminogen are associated with the globulin fraction, antiplasmin with the albumin. Fibrinolytic activity can be induced in plasma by the addition of chloroform, which destroys antiplasmin, or of streptokinase, which activates plasminogen. Activity also occurs spontaneously in human subjects who have suffered surgical operation3, trauma, fear4, strenuous exercise, or the injection of adrenalin5."

Later, he evolved a technique for maize3 with 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride, which was used in Germany during the War4. As information about other cereals was inadequate, a preliminary assessment of this compound as a germination indicator has now been made."

https://openalex.org/W1980485434,"RETINENE1, first noted by Wald in his work on the visual-purple cycle, is the aldehyde of vitamin A1, from which it has been prepared in high purity2. Retinene2, the corresponding aldehyde of vitamin A2, enters into the porphyropsin cycle of freshwater fish retinas. It has been obtained by fractionation of the aldehydes prepared from a mixture of vitamins A1 and A2 derived from ling-cod liver oil3. As described by Wald, retinene2 shows λmax. 405 mµ in chloroform) and 705 mµ in the antimony trichloride colour test. The preparation obtained by oxidation of vitamin A2 by means of manganese dioxide shows λmax. 405 mµ (chloroform), 385 mµ (cyclohexane), and 720 mµ (antimony trichloride test) fading to 705 mµ."

This is explicable by an 'exciton' mechanism whereby energy is handed on by resonance from molecule to molecule1. The graphs shown here represent a quantitative examination of the effect, the blue and green components of the fluorescence being measured by a photo-cell through Ilford filters 601 and 404 respectively. The upper graph shows for two temperatures the fall of the blue anthracene fluorescence and the rise of the green naphthacene fluorescence with concentration of the latter, expressed as quantum efficiencies with a probable error of 15 per cent. The emissions are about equal at a naphthacene concentration of 3 × 105, and the green reaches a maximum at about 103. Above this concentration the colour of the emission changes to yellow as for pure naphthacene, and the efficiency decreases, evidently due to the overstepping of the limits of solid solution."

https://openalex.org/W2416182181,"A 0.2N aqueous solution of sodium alginate (molecular weight ˜ 105) was extruded into 1N hydrochloric acid, thus producing alginic acid fibres, which were converted into calcium alginate by immersion in M/10 calcium acetate. The well-washed calcium alginate threads, fully swollen with water, contained 0.37 × 10-3gm.-equiv. calcium per gm., the ratio of equivalent calcium to equivalent water-insoluble acid was 1.0, and the dry weight was about 8 percent. These fibres were opaque ; slightly elastic, birefringent and capable of heterogeneous cation exchange reactions in which a replacement of the calcium by other cations takes place."
https://openalex.org/W1978640256,"RECENT investigations into the problems of (a) 'mealiness' of the cooked flesh of the Cape John Dory (Zeus capensis) and (b) milky spots in smoked fillets of the stockfish (Merlucius capensis) have revealed that the abnormalities are a consequence of heavy infections of the muscle fibre by a protozoal parasite. The parasite is identical to that described by Gilchrist1 as Chloromyxum thyrsites causing the 'pap' condition of the snoek (Thyrsites atun). Fantham2, however, suggested that the organism might be identical to Chloromyxum quadratum, Thélohans."

Both carbon isotopes1,2 are most conveniently prepared in the chemical form of carbon dioxide, but acetylene is a better starting substance for a number of syntheses. In our experiments, pure barium metal was heated in a stainless steel vacuum furnace of special design in the presence of carbon dioxide, which was absorbed with the formation of barium carbide."

https://openalex.org/W1996328841,"WHEN chromatographic adsorption analysis is used for colourless substances (or on strongly coloured adsorbents, for example, activated carbon) it is impossible to see the zones of the different solutes adsorbed on the column. Some special arrangement is then needed in order to be able to locate the zones. In principle, two methods are available : (1) no observation is made on the column, but instead the concentration of the solution leaving the column is followed in a small cell ; (2) the positions of the zones on the column are determined by using some special physical or chemical properties of the solutes. The first method, which was introduced by Tiselius1 and improved by Tiselius and me2,3, has also the advantage that the separation between two adjacent zones is greater in the filtrate than on the column. However, in many cases it is of importance to follow the separation directly on the column, and a number of different arrangements have been proposed4. In most of these cases the solutes either are converted into coloured compounds by means of suitable reagents, or indicators are applied before or after the chromatogram is finished, or use is made of fluorescence methods. These methods are, however, limited in use and unsuitable when zones are in direct contact with each other."

https://openalex.org/W2029073641,"As is well known, the atomic mass of silicon has not yet been determined with satisfactory accuracy. The value given in the International Table of Atomic Weights is 28.06. Practically the same value, 28.063, was given by Baxter, Weatherill and Scripture1 in 1923 from the ratio SiCl4/4Ag. But from the same ratio, figures of 28.111 had been obtained in 1920 by Baxter, Weatherill and Holmes2 and of 28.105 by Honigschmidt and Steinheil3. Finally, in 1923, Weatherill and Brundage4, from the ratio SiCl4/SiO2, gave the value 28.106. The three of the four modern gravimetric values are in fair agreement and lead to a mean figure of 28.106, which exceeds by 1/610 approximately the figure given in the International Table. This difference, considering the precision of modern gravimetric methods, is too great to be accepted without reservations, and it makes desirable and urgent a further revision of the atomic mass of silicon."

In agreement with these findings in experiments conducted here, a low succinoxidase activity was found in hepatic tumours produced by feeding p-dimethylaminoazobenzene7. In a series of experiments, however, the completion of which has been delayed for technical reasons, it was observed that hepatic tumours produced by feeding 2-acetaminofluorene have an exceptional position in so far that the succinoxidase content of these tumours is about the same as, or but very slightly lower than, that of livers from normal rats on the same diet without the carcinogenic compound."

https://openalex.org/W2018736657,"THE retinal elements in the cat's eye1, as isolated by the micro-electrode technique, are, like those of the frog's eye2, of three types : pure on-elements discharging merely to on set of illumination, pure off-elements inhibited by light and discharging merely to cessation of illumination, and on-off-elements combining the two properties. If a polarizing current of some 0.7–1.0 mA. is passed through the retina between electrodes stuck in vertically into the nasal and temporal cavities outside the bulb, it is possible to elicit on- and off-effects also by polarization3. In such experiments it is necessary always to place the micro-electrode in the same part of the retina, so as to preserve a constant relation to thepolarizing source. Threshold responses to polarization can be measured with an accuracy of 5 per cent. In the following description of the polarities of the retinal elements, the terms cathodal and anodal refer to threshold responses at the nasal polarizing electrode."
https://openalex.org/W2024262332,"CATIONIC detergents, the bactericidal property of which was discovered by Domagk (1938), have a precipitating effect on certain proteins (Kuhn–Bielig, 1940). Since this precipitation occurs at high pH. values, it is evident that it is due to salt-like bonds between the positively charged groups of the detergent and negative groups of the proteins. It is not surprising, therefore, that similar precipitates were observed when solutions of polysaccharidic acids, such as agar-agar, heparin, or gum arabic, were added to those of Desogen (Geigy), that is, methyl-phenyl-dodecyl-trimethyl-ammonium methosulphate. In the course of these experiments it was observed, however, that polysaccharides devoid of acidic groups were also precipitated by Desogen. Thus soluble starch (Merck, Schuchardt), dissolved in distilled water or in salt solution at different pH values, gave distinct precipitates. Two minima of turbidity were observed, one at a pH of 14 and another close to pH 7 (see table)."

https://openalex.org/W2014434418,"THE rate of oxidation of cellulose by dilute solutions of sodium hypochlorite has been shown to be accelerated if certain vat dyes are also present in the reduced form upon the fibre1,2. Ferrous hydroxide precipitated on cellulose exerts a similar influence on the rate of oxidation3. The mechanism of this acceleration is not yet clear. It has been suggested2 that the difference between the oxidation potential of the oxidizing agent and the reduction potential of the vat dye may be the determining factor in the acceleration of the oxidation. The present investigation deals with the measurement of reduction potentials of vat dyes upon the fibre and their influence on the acceleration of the rate of oxidation of the cellulose substrate by dilute sodium hypochlorite solution."

KAPLAN1 proposes the name 'active oxygen' for certain luminous phenomena observed by him “just as the name active nitrogen was given to similar phenomena in nitrogen”. I write to point out that this is not historically correct. I say so with some confidence, having coined the phrase 'active nitrogen' myself2. The full title of the paper cited was “A Chemically Active Modification of Nitrogen, Produced by the Electric Discharge”, and in the same paper it was shortened into “active nitrogen”."
https://openalex.org/W4255180686,"THE debate on university education in the House of Lords on May 14 was noteworthy for an important speech by the Lord Chancellor, Viscount Jowett, and for a contribution by Lord Cherwell which men of science should find of special interest. Lord Cherwell, in a cogent argument dealing with the dangers of central control of the universities, made a plea for the safeguarding of their autonomy in the increasing dependence of the universities on the Government for financial support ; and he urged again the vital importance of not divorcing research from teaching, or teaching from work on the frontiers of knowledge. Speaking of the importance of the student having an opportunity of both studying the advance of knowledge and having it expounded and explained by those who were themselves working on the frontiers of knowledge, Lord Cherwell formulated admirably the function of a university teacher. This, as he sees it, is to develop in young people the habits of exact and logical thought, to show them how and where the underlying facts can be ascertained on which our conclusions are to be based, to indicate to them how the great minds of the past have tackled problems, to show what conclusions they have reached and how they have justified them ; and, above all, to arouse the students' curiosity and interest and to stimulate them to spend laborious days and nights in an effort themselves to contribute something towards the advance of knowledge."

https://openalex.org/W2056226662,"SOME interest has been taken in the summary of my Royal Institution lectures1, and Dr. E. C. Stathis, of the University of Athens, has directed attention to a paper2 by Prof. K. Zenghelis, of that University, on the kerotakis apparatus. Hoefer3, who reproduced a diagram of it from a Paris manuscript4, which5 is copied from the old Venice manuscript6, called it a 'bain-Marie à kérotakis', explaining that it was not a water bath (as this name would suggest) but a sand- or ash-bath. The same name is used by Berthelot7, who, however, gives a more adequate description of the apparatus, and in particular indicates that the name comes from that of the triangular palette used by painters in encaustic for keeping liquid the wax pigments. He gives several pictures of the apparatus, which make it clear that there were several forms, probably destined for different uses. The one under consideration is that which I described8 in 1929 as a small charcoal brazier, surmounted by a piece of apparatus the use of which is not immediately obvious, and in my lecture I stated that it was used for sublimation. The invention of this apparatus is attributed9 to the early chemist Maria the Jewess (first century A.D.)."
https://openalex.org/W2066252636,"IN view of the recent discovery of elements with atomic numbers 93–96, it is of interest to recall a calculation based on the assumption of a minimum proper length for the world-line of an electron1. The conception that it is impossible to discriminate in space-time between two positions of the electron when the interval separating them is less than h/m0c (m0 = rest mass) leads to the result that an electron in a Bohr orbit cannot have a velocity greater than c/2. A further consequence of this is that a K-ring cannot exist in an atom for which Z> hc/22pie2and this means that the Bohr-Rutherford model would stop at Z = 96. Although the original argument leading to this result cannot be regarded as free from objection in the light of modern quantum theory, the likelihood of some such limitation remains. A more recent application of the principle of minimum length and time to the Rutherford-Bohr atom sets the upper limit to Z somewhat lower than 962."
