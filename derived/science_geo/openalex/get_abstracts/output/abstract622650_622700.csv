https://openalex.org/W2900976549,"Myofibroblast diversity with injury and aging Fibroblasts deposit extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules to regulate tissue strength and function. However, if too much ECM is deposited, fibrosis and scarring results. Shook et al. examined cells during mouse skin wound healing, fibrosis, and aging (see the Perspective by Willenborg and Eming). They identified distinct subpopulations of myofibroblasts, including cells identified as adipocyte precursors (APs). In cellular ablation mouse models, CD301b-expressing macrophages selectively activated proliferation of APs, but not other myofibroblasts. Myofibroblast composition and gene expression changed during aging. Thus, macrophage-fibroblast interactions are important during tissue repair and aging, which may have therapeutic implications for chronic wounds and fibrotic disease.

https://openalex.org/W3102059854,"The superposition of quantum states is one of the hallmarks of quantum physics, and clear demonstrations of superposition have been achieved in a number of quantum systems. However, mechanical systems have remained a challenge, with only indirect demonstrations of mechanical state superpositions, in spite of the intellectual appeal and technical utility such a capability would bring. This is due in part to the highly linear response of most mechanical systems, making quantum operation difficult, as well as their characteristically low frequencies, making it difficult to reach the quantum ground state. In this work, we demonstrate full quantum control of the mechanical state of a macroscopic mechanical resonator. We strongly couple a surface acoustic wave resonator to a superconducting qubit, using the qubit to control and measure quantum states in the mechanical resonator. Most notably, we generate a quantum superposition of the zero and one phonon states and map this and other states using Wigner tomography. This precise, programmable quantum control is essential to a range of applications of surface acoustic waves in the quantum limit, including using surface acoustic waves to couple disparate quantum systems."
https://openalex.org/W2901320017,"It is now well established that tumours undergo changes in cellular metabolism1. As this can reveal tumour cell vulnerabilities and because many tumours exhibit enhanced glucose uptake2, we have been interested in how tumour cells respond to different forms of sugar. Here we report that the monosaccharide mannose causes growth retardation in several tumour types in vitro, and enhances cell death in response to major forms of chemotherapy. We then show that these effects also occur in vivo in mice following the oral administration of mannose, without significantly affecting the weight and health of the animals. Mechanistically, mannose is taken up by the same transporter(s) as glucose3 but accumulates as mannose-6-phosphate in cells, and this impairs the further metabolism of glucose in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway and glycan synthesis. As a result, the administration of mannose in combination with conventional chemotherapy affects levels of anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, leading to sensitization to cell death. Finally we show that susceptibility to mannose is dependent on the levels of phosphomannose isomerase (PMI). Cells with low levels of PMI are sensitive to mannose, whereas cells with high levels are resistant, but can be made sensitive by RNA-interference-mediated depletion of the enzyme. In addition, we use tissue microarrays to show that PMI levels also vary greatly between different patients and different tumour types, indicating that PMI levels could be used as a biomarker to direct the successful administration of mannose. We consider that the administration of mannose could be a simple, safe and selective therapy in the treatment of cancer, and could be applicable to multiple tumour types. Mannose reduces the growth of tumour cells by impairing the metabolism of glucose, and enhances cell death when used in combination with conventional chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2900839584,"Vertebrates have greatly elaborated the basic chordate body plan and evolved highly distinctive genomes that have been sculpted by two whole-genome duplications. Here we sequence the genome of the Mediterranean amphioxus (Branchiostoma lanceolatum) and characterize DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, histone modifications and transcriptomes across multiple developmental stages and adult tissues to investigate the evolution of the regulation of the chordate genome. Comparisons with vertebrates identify an intermediate stage in the evolution of differentially methylated enhancers, and a high conservation of gene expression and its cis-regulatory logic between amphioxus and vertebrates that occurs maximally at an earlier mid-embryonic phylotypic period. We analyse regulatory evolution after whole-genome duplications, and find that-in vertebrates-over 80% of broadly expressed gene families with multiple paralogues derived from whole-genome duplications have members that restricted their ancestral expression, and underwent specialization rather than subfunctionalization. Counter-intuitively, paralogues that restricted their expression increased the complexity of their regulatory landscapes. These data pave the way for a better understanding of the regulatory principles that underlie key vertebrate innovations."
https://openalex.org/W2901171936,"Development and routine tissue homeostasis require a high turnover of apoptotic cells. These cells are removed by professional and non-professional phagocytes via efferocytosis1. How a phagocyte maintains its homeostasis while coordinating corpse uptake, processing ingested materials and secreting anti-inflammatory mediators is incompletely understood1,2. Here, using RNA sequencing to characterize the transcriptional program of phagocytes actively engulfing apoptotic cells, we identify a genetic signature involving 33 members of the solute carrier (SLC) family of membrane transport proteins, in which expression is specifically modulated during efferocytosis, but not during antibody-mediated phagocytosis. We assessed the functional relevance of these SLCs in efferocytic phagocytes and observed a robust induction of an aerobic glycolysis program, initiated by SLC2A1-mediated glucose uptake, with concurrent suppression of the oxidative phosphorylation program. The different steps of phagocytosis2—that is, ‘smell’ (‘find-me’ signals or sensing factors released by apoptotic cells), ‘taste’ (phagocyte–apoptotic cell contact) and ‘ingestion’ (corpse internalization)—activated distinct and overlapping sets of genes, including several SLC genes, to promote glycolysis. SLC16A1 was upregulated after corpse uptake, increasing the release of lactate, a natural by-product of aerobic glycolysis3. Whereas glycolysis within phagocytes contributed to actin polymerization and the continued uptake of corpses, lactate released via SLC16A1 promoted the establishment of an anti-inflammatory tissue environment. Collectively, these data reveal a SLC program that is activated during efferocytosis, identify a previously unknown reliance on aerobic glycolysis during apoptotic cell uptake and show that glycolytic by-products of efferocytosis can influence surrounding cells. Distinct transcriptional programs are activated during different stages of apoptotic cell engulfment, including a unique program of genes coding for solute carrier proteins and enzymes in the glycolytic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2899138741,"Quantum states of mechanical motion can be important resources for quantum information, metrology, and studies of fundamental physics. Recent demonstrations of superconducting qubits coupled to acoustic resonators have opened up the possibility of performing quantum operations on macroscopic motional modes, which can act as long-lived quantum memories or transducers. In addition, they can potentially be used to test for novel decoherence mechanisms in macroscopic objects and other modifications to standard quantum theory. Many of these applications call for the ability to create and characterize complex quantum states, putting demanding requirements on the speed of quantum operations and the coherence of the mechanical mode. In this work, we demonstrate the controlled generation of multi-phonon Fock states in a macroscopic bulk-acoustic wave resonator. We also perform Wigner tomography and state reconstruction to highlight the quantum nature of the prepared states. These demonstrations are made possible by the long coherence times of our acoustic resonator and our ability to selectively couple to individual phonon modes. Our work shows that circuit quantum acousto-dynamics (circuit QAD) enables sophisticated quantum control of macroscopic mechanical objects and opens the door to using acoustic modes as novel quantum resources."
https://openalex.org/W2901502534,"The diversity and complexity of the human brain are widely assumed to be encoded within a constant genome. Somatic gene recombination, which changes germline DNA sequences to increase molecular diversity, could theoretically alter this code but has not been documented in the brain, to our knowledge. Here we describe recombination of the Alzheimer’s disease-related gene APP, which encodes amyloid precursor protein, in human neurons, occurring mosaically as thousands of variant ‘genomic cDNAs’ (gencDNAs). gencDNAs lacked introns and ranged from full-length cDNA copies of expressed, brain-specific RNA splice variants to myriad smaller forms that contained intra-exonic junctions, insertions, deletions, and/or single nucleotide variations. DNA in situ hybridization identified gencDNAs within single neurons that were distinct from wild-type loci and absent from non-neuronal cells. Mechanistic studies supported neuronal ‘retro-insertion’ of RNA to produce gencDNAs; this process involved transcription, DNA breaks, reverse transcriptase activity, and age. Neurons from individuals with sporadic Alzheimer’s disease showed increased gencDNA diversity, including eleven mutations known to be associated with familial Alzheimer’s disease that were absent from healthy neurons. Neuronal gene recombination may allow ‘recording’ of neural activity for selective ‘playback’ of preferred gene variants whose expression bypasses splicing; this has implications for cellular diversity, learning and memory, plasticity, and diseases of the human brain. The gene for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) shows somatic gene recombination in neurons, and the abundance and diversity of APP variants is increased in neurons from individuals with Alzheimer’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W2899020985,"A dominant histopathological feature in neuromuscular diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and inclusion body myopathy, is cytoplasmic aggregation of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43. Although rare mutations in TARDBP-the gene that encodes TDP-43-that lead to protein misfolding often cause protein aggregation, most patients do not have any mutations in TARDBP. Therefore, aggregates of wild-type TDP-43 arise in most patients by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that TDP-43 is an essential protein for normal skeletal muscle formation that unexpectedly forms cytoplasmic, amyloid-like oligomeric assemblies, which we call myo-granules, during regeneration of skeletal muscle in mice and humans. Myo-granules bind to mRNAs that encode sarcomeric proteins and are cleared as myofibres mature. Although myo-granules occur during normal skeletal-muscle regeneration, myo-granules can seed TDP-43 amyloid fibrils in vitro and are increased in a mouse model of inclusion body myopathy. Therefore, increased assembly or decreased clearance of functionally normal myo-granules could be the source of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates that commonly occur in neuromuscular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2899163437,"Limited DNA end resection is the key to impaired homologous recombination in BRCA1-mutant cancer cells. Here, using a loss-of-function CRISPR screen, we identify DYNLL1 as an inhibitor of DNA end resection. The loss of DYNLL1 enables DNA end resection and restores homologous recombination in BRCA1-mutant cells, thereby inducing resistance to platinum drugs and inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Low BRCA1 expression correlates with increased chromosomal aberrations in primary ovarian carcinomas, and the junction sequences of somatic structural variants indicate diminished homologous recombination. Concurrent decreases in DYNLL1 expression in carcinomas with low BRCA1 expression reduced genomic alterations and increased homology at lesions. In cells, DYNLL1 limits nucleolytic degradation of DNA ends by associating with the DNA end-resection machinery (MRN complex, BLM helicase and DNA2 endonuclease). In vitro, DYNLL1 binds directly to MRE11 to limit its end-resection activity. Therefore, we infer that DYNLL1 is an important anti-resection factor that influences genomic stability and responses to DNA-damaging chemotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2896225064,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a frequent cause of difficult-to-treat, often fatal infections in humans1,2. Most humans have antibodies against S. aureus, but these are highly variable and often not protective in immunocompromised patients3. Previous vaccine development programs have not been successful4. A large percentage of human antibodies against S. aureus target wall teichoic acid (WTA), a ribitol-phosphate (RboP) surface polymer modified with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)5,6. It is currently unknown whether the immune evasion capacities of MRSA are due to variation of dominant surface epitopes such as those associated with WTA. Here we show that a considerable proportion of the prominent healthcare-associated and livestock-associated MRSA clones CC5 and CC398, respectively, contain prophages that encode an alternative WTA glycosyltransferase. This enzyme, TarP, transfers GlcNAc to a different hydroxyl group of the WTA RboP than the standard enzyme TarS7, with important consequences for immune recognition. TarP-glycosylated WTA elicits 7.5-40-fold lower levels of immunoglobulin G in mice than TarS-modified WTA. Consistent with this, human sera contained only low levels of antibodies against TarP-modified WTA. Notably, mice immunized with TarS-modified WTA were not protected against infection with tarP-expressing MRSA, indicating that TarP is crucial for the capacity of S. aureus to evade host defences. High-resolution structural analyses of TarP bound to WTA components and uridine diphosphate GlcNAc (UDP-GlcNAc) explain the mechanism of altered RboP glycosylation and form a template for targeted inhibition of TarP. Our study reveals an immune evasion strategy of S. aureus based on averting the immunogenicity of its dominant glycoantigen WTA. These results will help with the identification of invariant S. aureus vaccine antigens and may enable the development of TarP inhibitors as a new strategy for rendering MRSA susceptible to human host defences."
https://openalex.org/W2901661105,"The strigolactones, a class of plant hormones, regulate many aspects of plant physiology. In the inhibition of shoot branching, the α/β hydrolase D14—which metabolizes strigolactone—interacts with the F-box protein D3 to ubiquitinate and degrade the transcription repressor D53. Despite the fact that multiple modes of interaction between D14 and strigolactone have recently been determined, how the hydrolase functions with D3 to mediate hormone-dependent D53 ubiquitination remains unknown. Here we show that D3 has a C-terminal α-helix that can switch between two conformational states. The engaged form of this α-helix facilitates the binding of D3 and D14 with a hydrolysed strigolactone intermediate, whereas the dislodged form can recognize unmodified D14 in an open conformation and inhibits its enzymatic activity. The D3 C-terminal α-helix enables D14 to recruit D53 in a strigolactone-dependent manner, which in turn activates the hydrolase. By revealing the structural plasticity of the SCFD3–D14 ubiquitin ligase, our results suggest a mechanism by which the E3 coordinates strigolactone signalling and metabolism. The plant F-box protein D3 has a C-terminal α-helix that switches between two conformational states, allowing the α/β hydrolase D14 to recruit the transcription repressor D53 for strigolactone-dependent degradation."

https://openalex.org/W2901557802,"The zoonotic transmission of hantaviruses from their rodent hosts to humans in North and South America is associated with a severe and frequently fatal respiratory disease, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS)1,2. No specific antiviral treatments for HPS are available, and no molecular determinants of in vivo susceptibility to hantavirus infection and HPS are known. Here we identify the human asthma-associated gene protocadherin-1 (PCDH1)3-6 as an essential determinant of entry and infection in pulmonary endothelial cells by two hantaviruses that cause HPS, Andes virus (ANDV) and Sin Nombre virus (SNV). In vitro, we show that the surface glycoproteins of ANDV and SNV directly recognize the outermost extracellular repeat domain of PCDH1-a member of the cadherin superfamily7,8-to exploit PCDH1 for entry. In vivo, genetic ablation of PCDH1 renders Syrian golden hamsters highly resistant to a usually lethal ANDV challenge. Targeting PCDH1 could provide strategies to reduce infection and disease caused by New World hantaviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2901421008,"The sensory cells that are responsible for hearing include the cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs), with the OHCs being necessary for sound sensitivity and tuning1. Both cell types are thought to arise from common progenitors; however, our understanding of the factors that control the fate of IHCs and OHCs remains limited. Here we identify Ikzf2 (which encodes Helios) as an essential transcription factor in mice that is required for OHC functional maturation and hearing. Helios is expressed in postnatal mouse OHCs, and in the cello mouse model a point mutation in Ikzf2 causes early-onset sensorineural hearing loss. Ikzf2cello/cello OHCs have greatly reduced prestin-dependent electromotile activity, a hallmark of OHC functional maturation, and show reduced levels of crucial OHC-expressed genes such as Slc26a5 (which encodes prestin) and Ocm. Moreover, we show that ectopic expression of Ikzf2 in IHCs: induces the expression of OHC-specific genes; reduces the expression of canonical IHC genes; and confers electromotility to IHCs, demonstrating that Ikzf2 can partially shift the IHC transcriptome towards an OHC-like identity. Ikzf2, which encodes the transcription factor Helios, is identified as a crucial regulator of gene expression in maturing cochlear outer hair cells, and overexpression of Ikzf2 in inner hair cells induces prestin expression and electromotility."
https://openalex.org/W2900487169,"Carbon dioxide is produced by many organic processes and is a convenient volatile cue for insects1 that are searching for blood hosts2, flowers3, communal nests4, fruit5 and wildfires6. Although Drosophila melanogaster feed on yeast that produce CO2 and ethanol during fermentation, laboratory experiments7-12 suggest that walking flies avoid CO2. Here we resolve this paradox by showing that both flying and walking Drosophila find CO2 attractive, but only when they are in an active state associated with foraging. Their aversion to CO2 at low-activity levels may be an adaptation to avoid parasites that seek CO2, or to avoid succumbing to respiratory acidosis in the presence of high concentrations of CO2 that exist in nature13,14. In contrast to CO2, flies are attracted to ethanol in all behavioural states, and invest twice the time searching near ethanol compared to CO2. These behavioural differences reflect the fact that ethanol is a unique signature of yeast fermentation, whereas CO2 is generated by many natural processes. Using genetic tools, we determined that the evolutionarily conserved ionotropic co-receptor IR25a is required for CO2 attraction, and that the receptors necessary for CO2 avoidance are not involved in this attraction. Our study lays the foundation for future research to determine the neural circuits that underlie both state- and odorant-dependent decision-making in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2901624239,"The Cradle of Humankind (Cradle) in South Africa preserves a rich collection of fossil hominins representing Australopithecus, Paranthropus and Homo1. The ages of these fossils are contentious2-4 and have compromised the degree to which the South African hominin record can be used to test hypotheses of human evolution. However, uranium-lead (U-Pb) analyses of horizontally bedded layers of calcium carbonate (flowstone) provide a potential opportunity to obtain a robust chronology5. Flowstones are ubiquitous cave features and provide a palaeoclimatic context, because they grow only during phases of increased effective precipitation6,7, ideally in closed caves. Here we show that flowstones from eight Cradle caves date to six narrow time intervals between 3.2 and 1.3 million years ago. We use a kernel density estimate to combine 29 U-Pb ages into a single record of flowstone growth intervals. We interpret these as major wet phases, when an increased water supply, more extensive vegetation cover and at least partially closed caves allowed for undisturbed, semi-continuous growth of the flowstones. The intervening times represent substantially drier phases, during which fossils of hominins and other fossils accumulated in open caves. Fossil preservation, restricted to drier intervals, thus biases the view of hominin evolutionary history and behaviour, and places the hominins in a community of comparatively dry-adapted fauna. Although the periods of cave closure leave temporal gaps in the South African fossil record, the flowstones themselves provide valuable insights into both local and pan-African climate variability."
https://openalex.org/W2900740209,"Imagination is an internal simulation of real-life events and a common treatment tool for anxiety disorders; however, the neural processes by which imagination exerts behavioral control are unclear. This investigation tests whether and how imagined exposures to a threatening stimulus, conditioned in the real world, influence neural and physiological manifestations of threat. We found that imagined and real extinction are equally effective in the reduction of threat-related neural patterns and physiological responses elicited upon re-exposure to real-world threatening cues. Network connectivity during the extinction phase showed that imagined, like real, extinction engaged the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) as a central hub. vmPFC, primary auditory cortex, and amygdala activation during imagined and real extinction were predictive of individual differences in extinction success. The nucleus accumbens, however, predicted extinction success in the imagined extinction group alone. We conclude that deliberate imagination can attenuate reactions to threat through perceptual and associative learning mechanisms."

Brains from flies to humans comprise vast numbers of different types of neurons interconnected by networks of precisely patterned synaptic connections. Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying the specification of neural circuit assembly are poorly understood. The predominant model, based on Roger Sperry’s “chemoaffinity hypothesis,” postulates that neurons make specific connections with their targets based on interactions between specific cell surface molecules (Sperry, 1963Sperry R.W. Chemoaffinity in the orderly growth of nerve fiber patterns and connections.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1963; 50: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Cell-cell recognition proteins are often members of families diversified in evolution by gene duplication to yield numerous members, each bearing a canonical binding interface characteristic of the family (Himanen and Nikolov, 2003Himanen J.P.

Understanding the logic underlying the patterning of neural networks will require determination of the binding affinities of cell recognition proteins, their expression patterns, their signaling properties, and gain- and loss-of-function genetic analyses. In Drosophila, two families of cell-recognition proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), the 21-member Dpr (defective proboscis extension response) and the 11-member DIP (Dpr interacting proteins) families, have many of the properties expected of proteins controlling synaptic specificity. Members of each family are expressed in subsets of neurons throughout the developing nervous system (Carrillo et al., 2015Carrillo R.A. Özkan E. Menon K.P. Nagarkar-Jaiswal S. Lee P.T. Jeon M.

It remains unclear from these earlier studies, however, whether each medulla neuron type expresses many DIPs as observed for Dpr expression in lamina neurons or only a more limited repertoire of them. In the accompanying paper, single Dm12 neurons with DIP-α null mutations exhibit robust defects in target-layer specificity in a wild-type background, and misexpression of cognate Dpr ligands dramatically re-specifies these connections (Xu et al., 2018Xu S.

The number of DIP and Dpr paralogs, their patterns of expression within the brain, and the complexity of the DIP/Dpr interactome allude to a widespread and complex role in patterning neural circuitry.

Although such assays are effective at identifying heterophilic binding, technical constraints of the method often select against the detection of homophilic interactions (Bushell et al., 2008Bushell K.M. Söllner C. Schuster-Boeckler B. Bateman A. Wright G.J. Large-scale screening for novel low-affinity extracellular protein interactions.Genome Res. 2008; 18: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these assays utilized multimerized chimeras to increase binding affinities so as to enable robust detection; as a consequence, however, this method inherently obscures the native molecular binding affinities, yielding binary results that provide a yes or no answer as to whether an interaction takes place. Do binding affinities of adhesion proteins significantly impact interactions between cells? Differential affinities can have clear effects on signaling between adherent cells: for example, T cells bearing receptors with different affinities for peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) complexes on antigen-presenting cells adopt different developmental fates (Stone et al., 2009Stone J.D. Chervin A.S. Kranz D.M. T-cell receptor binding affinities and kinetics: impact on T-cell activity and specificity.Immunology. 2009; 126: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). With respect to selectivity of cellular interactions, type I classical cadherin family proteins provide a typical example of the role of affinity: each type I cadherin family member binds to all other type I family members, yet the differences in affinity of each pairwise interaction dictate their distinct adhesive and cell-patterning functions (Katsamba et al., 2009Katsamba P. Carroll K. Ahlsen G. Bahna F. Vendome J. Posy S. Rajebhosale M. Price S. Jessell T.M. Ben-Shaul A. et al.Linking molecular affinity and cellular specificity in cadherin-mediated adhesion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 11594-11599Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, Vendome et al., 2014Vendome J. Felsovalyi K. Song H. Yang Z. Jin X. Brasch J. Harrison O.J. Ahlsen G. Bahna F.

USA. 2014; 111: E4175-E4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, for protein families with promiscuous binding, in which selectivity is dictated mainly through the differential pairwise binding affinities of different family members, quantitative measures are required to understand their function. In the nervous system, binding affinities of cell-cell recognition proteins have been shown to control the targeting of neurites to their appropriate partners. For example, members of the two-protein family of Ig-like sidekick (Sdk) proteins are expressed in specific layers within the inner plexiform region of the mouse retina during synapse formation. In vitro, Sdk1 and Sdk2 bind heterophilically through a canonical interface, but their homophilic affinities are stronger (Goodman et al., 2016Goodman K.M. Yamagata M. Jin X. Mannepalli S. Katsamba P.S. Ahlsén G. Sergeeva A.P. Honig B. Sanes J.R. Shapiro L. Molecular basis of sidekick-mediated cell-cell adhesion and specificity.eLife. 2016; 5: e19058Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Despite their heterophilic binding, the higher affinity of the respective homophilic interactions appears to determine their synaptic targeting activities (Krishnaswamy et al., 2015Krishnaswamy A.

Sanes J.R. Dscam and Sidekick proteins direct lamina-specific synaptic connections in vertebrate retina.Nature. 2008; 451: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). By contrast, within this same region of the retina, the type II cadherin family members cadherin-8 and cadherin-9, which show distinctive heterophilic and homophilic affinities to other type II cadherin family members (Brasch et al., 2018Brasch J. Katsamba P.S. Harrison O.J. Ahlsén G. Troyanovsky R.B. Indra I. Kaczynska A. Kaeser B. Troyanovsky S. Honig B. Shapiro L.

DIP-Dpr binding specificity is controlled by interactions between their immunoglobulin-like extracellular domains (Carrillo et al., 2015Carrillo R.A. Özkan E. Menon K.P. Nagarkar-Jaiswal S. Lee P.T. Jeon M. Birnbaum M.E. Bellen H.J. Garcia K.C. Zinn K.

The extracellular regions of Dpr family members consist of two tandem Ig-like domains, and the extracellular region of DIP family members consists of three tandem Ig-like domains (Özkan et al., 2013Özkan E. Carrillo R.A. Eastman C.L. Weiszmann R. Waghray D. Johnson K.G. Zinn K. Celniker S.E. Garcia K.C.

The crystal structure of a two-domain fragment of DIP-α in complex with the membrane-distal Ig1 domain of Dpr6 revealed the Ig1-Ig1 interaction to be characterized by a buried core of hydrophobic residues and an extensive network of hydrogen bonds (Carrillo et al., 2015Carrillo R.A.

Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, members of the nectin and SYG-related protein families exhibit both homophilic and heterophilic binding. Here, as a step toward understanding how DIP and Dpr protein families contribute to neural circuit assembly, we sought to extend understanding of both the binding affinities of DIPs/Dprs and the neuron-specific localization of DIPs in the Drosophila visual system. We used the multi-color flip out (MCFO) technique (Nern et al., 2015Nern A. Pfeiffer B.D. Rubin G.M. Optimized tools for multicolor stochastic labeling reveal diverse stereotyped cell arrangements in the fly visual system.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: E2967-E2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) to provide a more extensive map of DIP expression in the medulla. To assess the biophysical properties of interactions between protein family members, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to determine binding affinities for all DIP-Dpr interactions, identified DIPs and Dprs that form homodimers, and identified specificity-determining residues in DIP-Dpr interfaces that had not previously been noticed. We used this new knowledge to design site-directed mutants with defined intermolecular binding affinities for in vivo functional experiments reported in the accompanying paper (Xu et al., 2018Xu S. Xiao Q. Cosmanescu F. Sergeeva A.P. Yoo J. Lin Y. Katsamba P.S. Ahlsen G. Kaufman J. Linaval N. et al.Interactions between the Ig-Superfamily Proteins DIP-α and Dpr6/10 Regulate Assembly of Neural Circuits.Neuron. 2018; 100 (this issue): 1369-1384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our biophysical studies raise the intriguing possibility that DIP/Dpr interactions function over a wide range of affinities to regulate neural circuit assembly throughout the Drosophila nervous system. Using Minos-mediated integration cassette (MiMIC) insertions and derivatives of them, we demonstrated that DIPs are expressed in many medulla neuron types (Tan et al., 2015Tan L. Zhang K.X. Pecot M.Y. Nagarkar-Jaiswal S. Lee P.T. Takemura S.Y. McEwen J.M. Nern A. Xu S. Tadros W. et al.Ig superfamily ligand and receptor pairs expressed in synaptic partners in Drosophila.Cell. 2015; 163: 1756-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) but are largely absent in lamina neurons. Using a candidate approach, we showed that, indeed, some DIPs are expressed in synaptic partners of lamina neurons, which expressed cognate Dpr proteins. It was unclear from these studies, however, what fraction of medulla neuron types express DIPs and whether each of these medulla neuron types also expresses multiple DIPs or a more restricted set of them. Here, we set out to address these issues. Determining the expression of Dprs using MiMIC insertions into Dpr loci was facilitated by co-staining experiments with well-characterized antibodies to nuclear proteins specific for each lamina neuron type (Tan et al., 2015Tan L. Zhang K.X. Pecot M.Y. Nagarkar-Jaiswal S. Lee P.T. Takemura S.Y. McEwen J.M. Nern A. Xu S. Tadros W. et al.Ig superfamily ligand and receptor pairs expressed in synaptic partners in Drosophila.Cell. 2015; 163: 1756-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). By contrast, only a few cell types in the medulla can be identified in this way, due to the paucity of appropriate antibodies. We therefore sought to correlate patterns of DIP expression with the morphologies of different medulla neurons (Figure 1A). This was done using GAL4 transcription traps inserted into different DIP loci to drive expression of a membrane-bound epitope-tagged protein or a fluorescent protein that highlights the entire morphology of these neurons (Figure 1B) and a recombination-based method (i.e., MCFO) to generate sparsely labeled populations of these cells to more readily assess their morphologies (Figures 1B’–1J). In some cases, the density of staining precluded a simple reconstruction of the morphology of a single neuron. In these preparations, we were able to identify single neurons by comparing them to reference neurons from sparsely labeled samples (e.g., compare Figures 1J and 1J’). Additional examples of cells identified in this way are shown in Figures S1, S2, and S3. We chose to assess the expression in a well-characterized population of medulla neurons, in which fluorescently labeled single neurons have been analyzed in detail. These include two large sets from two separate studies (Nern et al., 2015Nern A. Pfeiffer B.D. Rubin G.M.

In total, we assessed expression of eight different DIPs in 60 cell types (see Figure 2 for a summary of expression; GAL4 insertions were not available for the remaining 3 DIPs). Of these, 26 expressed a single DIP, 12 expressed two DIPs, and one expressed four DIPs. Assuming that these 60 medulla neuron types are likely to express the three remaining DIPs for which we do not have MiMIC insertions in a similar way, we estimate that some 54 of these 60 medulla neuron types (or 90%) express one or, less frequently, two different DIPs. We present examples of each type of neuron labeled in Figures 1B’–1J and Figures S1, S2, and S3. Recent studies from Davis et al., 2018Davis F.P. Nern A. Picard S. Reiser M.B. Rubin G.M. Eddy S.R.

There is a marked overlap in expression between these sequencing studies and our studies using the MCFO labeling method. The differences observed may reflect limitations in the DIP-GAL4 reporters or the MCFO method (e.g., different sensitivity of recombinase to heat-shock induction in different cell types, the possibility that the insertion of GAL4 within a DIP locus disrupts a subset of control elements regulating expression, or that transcripts from DIP loci are under translational control [i.e., the GAL4 mRNA is chimeric containing putative 5′ UTR translational regulatory sequences from the endogenous locus]). Alternatively, differences may reflect limitations in the INTACT method (e.g., low levels of expression or contamination from other cell types through the purification of tagged nuclei). Importantly, both methods reveal limited expression of DIPs in medulla neurons, by contrast to the far broader expression of Dprs in lamina neurons. We consider the significance of these patterns in forming neural circuits in the Discussion. In summary, the expression of many different DIPs and Dprs in processes of overlapping neurons, the requirement for some cognate pairs of these for patterning medulla circuits (Xu et al., 2018Xu S.

We used both an HEK293 and an S2 cell expression system to produce soluble whole ectodomains of 19 of the 21 Dprs and 8 of the 11 DIPs. The remaining Dprs and DIPs, Dpr9, Dpr15, DIP-δ, and the two DIP family members previously shown to have no Dpr interacting partners—CG31814, which we have named DIP-κ, and CG40378, which we have named DIP-λ—were either unstable or expressed poorly. Because structural studies show that trans-interaction specificity is contained within the Ig1 domain (Carrillo et al., 2015Carrillo R.A. Özkan E. Menon K.P. Nagarkar-Jaiswal S. Lee P.T. Jeon M.

https://openalex.org/W2900458025,"Drosophila Dpr (21 paralogs) and DIP proteins (11 paralogs) are cell recognition molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) that form a complex protein interaction network. DIP and Dpr proteins are expressed in a synaptic layer-specific fashion in the visual system. How interactions between these proteins regulate layer-specific synaptic circuitry is not known. Here we establish that DIP-α and its interacting partners Dpr6 and Dpr10 regulate multiple processes, including arborization within layers, synapse number, layer specificity, and cell survival. We demonstrate that heterophilic binding between Dpr6/10 and DIP-α and homophilic binding between DIP-α proteins promote interactions between processes in vivo. Knockin mutants disrupting the DIP/Dpr binding interface reveal a role for these proteins during normal development, while ectopic expression studies support an instructive role for interactions between DIPs and Dprs in circuit development. These studies support an important role for the DIP/Dpr protein interaction network in regulating cell-type-specific connectivity patterns."

Toxoplasma is transmitted by digesting parasites from feline feces (as oocysts) or undercooked meat (as tissue cysts). Once in the host, parasites convert to the tachyzoite form that disseminates to peripheral tissues (e.g. brain, retina, and muscle). The resulting immune response and/or drugs can control tachyzoite replication, but the parasite survives by encysting into slowly growing bradyzoites. Sporadically, burst of cysts allows the parasites to convert to tachyzoites, whose unchecked growth results in cell and tissue damage (5Lambert H. Barragan A.

Unique glycoconjugates are prime candidates for vaccine development and as markers for diagnostic monitoring. But before the full potential of these strategies can be realized, more structure–function studies are needed to guide selection of the most promising targets. Progress in exploiting these strategies has been inhibited by the uniqueness of the glycomes of Toxoplasma and other parasites and lack of information about the genetic basis of their nontemplate-driven mechanisms of assembly. Further understanding of the roles of glycans will benefit from genetic approaches to manipulate their biosynthesis. Sufficient knowledge currently exists to allow informed predictions of genes associated with glycan assembly (31Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. The carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy) in 2013.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24270786): D490-D49510.1093/nar/gkt1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (2986) Google Scholar), and MS provides the necessary resolution and sensitivity to interpret glycomic consequences of glycogene perturbations. This report describes the generation of a collection of CRISPR/Cas9-associated guide DNAs that are suitable for disrupting glycogenes, using an approach that is applicable to strains regardless of their NHEJ (Ku80) status (32Shen B. Brown K. Long S. Sibley L.D. Development of CRISPR/Cas9 for efficient genome editing in Toxoplasma gondii.Methods Mol.

A streamlined MS workflow was implemented to benchmark the new studies, which led to the discovery of several novel N- and O-glycans and the enzymatic basis for the assembly of these and other known glycans. Finally, the glycogene mutants were screened in a cell culture growth assay for information about their physiological significance. It is expected that the availability of these findings and associated resources will help stimulate interrogation of the role of glycosylation in future functional studies. Our algorithms predicted 33 GT-like genes and one glycophosphotransferase gene expected to contribute to the assembly of N-, O-, and C-glycans on proteins and the assembly of GPI-anchor precursors and other glycolipids. Four genes probably mediate N-glycan and GPI processing. An additional seven genes are likely to be involved with starch assembly and disassembly, and another contributes directly to synthesis of a cell wall polysaccharide. A total of 18 are involved in the generation of sugar nucleotides and Dol-P-sugars from simple sugars, and three probably mediate transport of sugar nucleotides into the secretory pathway. Our summary does not exclude the possibility of novel GT sequences yet to be discovered. Table 1 summarizes characteristics of the candidates, organized according to the class of glycoconjugates for which they are expected to contribute, along with findings from the literature and studies described below that provide support for the predicted functions.

Resolving these infections requires knowledge of B. duncani biology, virulence, and susceptibility to anti-infectives, but little is known and further research is hindered by a lack of relevant model systems. Here, we report the first continuous in vitro culture of B. duncani in human red blood cells. We show that during its asexual cycle within human erythrocytes, B. duncani develops and divides to form four daughter parasites with parasitemia doubling every ∼22 h. Using this in vitro culture assay, we found that B. duncani has low susceptibility to the four drugs recommended for treatment of human babesiosis, atovaquone, azithromycin, clindamycin, and quinine, with IC50 values ranging between 500 nm and 20 μm. These data suggest that current practices are of limited effect in treating the disease.

Evidence suggests a potential association between maternal hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, particularly preeclampsia, and adverse neurodevelopment in the offspring, but existing studies are subject to limitations. We aimed to assess whether in-utero exposure to preeclampsia/eclampsia negatively impacts academic performance at ages 9, 12 and 15 years.Using individually linked, nationwide data from the Icelandic registries we followed all children born in 1989-2004 (N = 68,580), from birth until the end of 2014, thereof 63,014 (91.9%) took at least one standardized test. Using a stepwise, mixed-effects approach, we modelled the hypothesized relationship while adjusting for maternal, perinatal and childhood variables of interest. We compared test scores, measured on a normalized scale ranging from 0-60 with a mean of 30 and a standard deviation of 10, in the 4th, 7th, and 10th grades, between children exposed to preeclampsia or eclampsia in-utero versus children from normotensive pregnancies in the population.Children exposed to preeclampsia/eclampsia scored lower than those unexposed in mathematics across all grade levels, corresponding to a difference of 0.44 points (95% CI: 0.00, 0.89), 0.59 points (95% CI: 0.13, 1.06) and 0.59 points (95% CI: 0.08, 1.10), respectively. No differences were observed in the language arts.Our findings suggest a minimal effect of maternal preeclampsia/eclampsia on children's academic performance at ages 9, 12 and 15 years. The differences observed in mathematic scores between exposed and unexposed children were minimal, less than one tenth of a standard deviation per measurement occasion."

However, the mechanism underlying GM2-synthase de-repression in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that higher GM2-synthase mRNA expression levels in various cancer cells and in human RCC tumors correlate with higher histone acetylation levels (H3K9, H3K14, or both) at region +38/+187 relative to the transcription start site (TSS) of the GM2-synthase gene than in normal kidney epithelial (NKE) cells or healthy adjacent tissues. An increase in GM2-synthase mRNA expression in cells treated with a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor was accompanied by increased histone acetylation levels at this promoter region. DNA methylation around the TSS was absent in both RCC cell lines and NKE cells. Of note, both the transcription factor Sp1 and corepressor HDAC1 associated with the +38/+187 region when the GM2-synthase gene was repressed in NKE and tumor-adjacent tissues, indicating plausible site-specific repressive roles of HDAC1 and Sp1 in GM2-synthase mRNA expression. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Sp1-binding site within the +38/+187 region relieved repressed luciferase activity of this region by limiting HDAC1 recruitment. Moreover, Sp1 or HDAC1 knock down increased GM2-synthase transcription, and butyrate-mediated activation of GM2-synthase mRNA expression in SK-RC-45 cells was accompanied by Sp1 and HDAC1 loss from the +38/+187 region. Taken together, we have identified an epigenetic mechanism for the de-repression of the GM2-synthase gene in RCC.

Interactions between HER2, HSP90, PMCA2, and NHERF1 within specialized plasma membrane domains contribute to the membrane retention of HER2. We hypothesized that the scaffolding protein ezrin, which has been shown to interact with NHERF1, might also help stabilize the HER2–PMCA2–NHERF1 complex at the plasma membrane. Therefore, we examined ezrin expression and its relationship with HER2, NHERF1, and PMCA2 levels in murine and human breast cancers. We also used genetic knockdown and/or pharmacologic inhibition of ezrin, HSP90, NHERF1, PMCA2, and HER2 to examine the functional relationships between these factors and membrane retention of HER2. We found ezrin to be expressed at low levels at the apical surface of normal mammary epithelial cells, but its expression is up-regulated and correlates with HER2 expression in hyperplasia and tumors in murine mammary tumor virus-Neu mice, in human HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines, and in ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive breast cancers from human patients. In breast cancer cells, ezrin co-localizes and interacts with HER2, NHERF1, PMCA2, and HSP90 in specialized membrane domains, and inhibiting ezrin disrupts interactions between HER2, PMCA2, NHERF1, and HSP90, inhibiting HER2 signaling and causing PKCα-mediated internalization and degradation of HER2. Inhibition of ezrin synergizes with lapatinib in a PKCα-dependent fashion to inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. We conclude that ezrin stabilizes a multiprotein complex that maintains active HER2 at the cell surface.

https://openalex.org/W2901327188,"Highly saturated genetic linkage maps are extremely helpful to breeders and are an essential prerequisite for many biological applications such as the identification of marker-trait associations, mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL), candidate gene identification, development of molecular markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS) and comparative genetic studies. Several high-density genetic maps, constructed using the 9K SNP peach array, are available for peach. However, each of these maps is based on a single mapping population and has limited use for QTL discovery and comparative studies. A consensus genetic linkage map developed from multiple populations provides not only a higher marker density and a greater genome coverage when compared to the individual maps, but also serves as a valuable tool for estimating genetic positions of unmapped markers. In this study, a previously developed linkage map from the cross between two peach cultivars 'Zin Dai' and 'Crimson Lady' (ZC2) was improved by genotyping additional progenies. In addition, a peach consensus map was developed based on the combination of the improved ZC2 genetic linkage map with three existing high-density genetic maps of peach and a reference map of Prunus. A total of 1,476 SNPs representing 351 unique marker positions were mapped across eight linkage groups on the ZC2 genetic map. The ZC2 linkage map spans 483.3 cM with an average distance between markers of 1.38 cM/marker. The MergeMap and LPmerge tools were used for the construction of a consensus map based on markers shared across five genetic linkage maps. The consensus linkage map contains a total of 3,092 molecular markers, consisting of 2,975 SNPs, 116 SSRs and 1 morphological marker associated with slow ripening in peach (SR). The consensus map provides valuable information on marker order and genetic position for QTL identification in peach and other genetic studies within Prunus and Rosaceae."

These metrics are thus, determinant to the stakeholder’s decisions on the conservation measures to be implemented. A detailed review of the literature (55 papers) showed that 18 spatial indicators were commonly used in marine ecology. Those indicators were than characterized and studied in detail, based on its application to empirical data (a time series of 35 marine species spatial distributions, sampled either with a random stratified survey or a regular transects surveys). The results suggest that the indicators can be grouped into three classes, that summarize the way the individuals occupy space: occupancy (the area occupied by a species), aggregation (spreading or concentration of species biomass) and quantity dependent (indicators correlated with biomass), whether these are spatially explicit (include the geographic coordinates, e.g. center of gravity) or not. Indicator’s temporal variability was lower than between species variability and no clear effect was observed in relation to sampling design. Species were then classified accordingly to their indicators. One indicator was selected from each of the three categories of indicators, to represent the main axes of species spatial behavior and to interpret them in terms of occupancy-aggregation-quantity relationships. All species considered were then classified according to their relationships among those three axes, into species that under increasing abundancy, primarily increase occupancy or aggregation or both. We suggest to use these relationships along the three-axes as surveillance diagrams to follow the yearly evolution of species distributional patterns in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2900619072,"N-(4-fluorophenyl)-N'-phenyl-N""-(pyrimidin-2-ylmethyl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine [ASP2905] is a potent and selective inhibitor of the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 3 (KCNH3) that was originally identified in our laboratory. KCNH3 is concentrated in the forebrain, and its overexpression in mice leads to cognitive deficits. In contrast, Kcnh3 knockout mice exhibit enhanced performance in cognitive tasks such as attention. These data suggest that KCNH3 plays important roles in cognition. Here we investigated the neurochemical and neurophysiological profiles of ASP2905 as well as its effects on cognitive function, focusing on attention. ASP2905 (0.0313 and 0.0625 mg/kg, po) improved the latent learning ability of mice, which reflects attention. Microdialysis assays in rats revealed that ASP2905 increased the efflux of dopamine and acetylcholine in the medial prefrontal cortex (0.03, 0.1 mg/kg, po; 0.1, 1 mg/kg, po, respectively). The activities of these neurotransmitters are closely associated with attention. We used a multiple-trial passive avoidance task to investigate the effects of ASP2905 on inattention and impulsivity in juvenile stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. ASP2905 (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, po) significantly prolonged cumulative latency as effectively as methylphenidate (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, sc), which is the gold standard for treating ADHD. Further, ASP2905, amphetamine, and methylphenidate significantly increased the alpha-band power of rats, suggesting that ASP2905 increases arousal, which is a pharmacologically important activity for treating ADHD. In contrast, atomoxetine and guanfacine did not significantly affect power. Together, these findings suggest that ASP2905, which acts through a novel mechanism, is as effective for treating ADHD as currently available drugs such as methylphenidate."

https://openalex.org/W2900742081,"The rates of pulmonary colonization and disease due to nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) appear to be increasing globally, but diversity of species recovered as well as clinical relevance of NTM isolates differ considerably by geographic region. The first nationwide study of isolation frequency and clinical significance of NTM in Serbia included all patients with respiratory specimens yielding a positive NTM culture over the six-year period, 2010-2015. We analyzed trends in annual NTM isolation and NTM pulmonary disease (PD) incidence rates, with NTM PD cases defined in accordance with microbiological criteria established by the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA). 777 pulmonary NTM isolates were collected from 565 patients, of whom 126 (22.3%) met the ATS/IDSA criteria. The annual NTM isolation and NTM PD incidence rates per 100,000 changed over 2010-2015 from 0.9 to 1.6 (p = 0.1746) and from 0.18 to 0.48 (p = f0.0040), respectively. Both isolation and disease rates increased considerably with age, while higher NTM PD rates were also associated with residence in urbanized areas. Diversity of NTM species isolated was shown to be region-specific, with M. xenopi as the most prevalent species (17.3%), and increasing isolation rates of rapid growing mycobacteria (RGM) (p = 0.0072). M. xenopi was also the most common cause of NTM PD (28.6%), followed by RGM (27.8%). With 73% clinically relevant isolates, M. abscessus was identified as the most clinically relevant NTM species. While NTM PD obviously remains a rare disease in Serbia, the overall results justify recognition of NTM as pathogens of rising importance, and require further characterization of their epidemiology in the country."

https://openalex.org/W2900473127,"The spatial scan statistic is commonly used to detect spatial and/or temporal disease clusters in epidemiological studies. Although multiple clusters in the study space can be thus identified, current theoretical developments are mainly based on detecting a ‘single’ cluster. The standard scan statistic procedure enables the detection of multiple clusters, recursively identifying additional ‘secondary’ clusters. However, their p-values are calculated one at a time, as if each cluster is a primary one. Therefore, a new procedure that can accurately evaluate multiple clusters as a whole is needed. The present study focuses on purely temporal cases and then proposes a new test procedure that evaluates the p-value for multiple clusters, combining generalized linear models with an information criterion approach. This framework encompasses the conventional, currently widely used detection procedure as a special case. An application study adopting the new framework is presented, analysing the Japanese daily incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases. The analysis reveals that the number of the incident increases around New Year’s Day in Japan. Further, simulation studies undertaken confirm that the proposed method possesses a consistency property that tends to select the correct number of clusters when the truth is known."

This period was coming-out party for animal life on Earth: Nearly all modern animal groups—as diverse as mollusks and chordates—leapt into fossil record, in a dazzling array of body plans. In recent years, a team from Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Canada, has shown that richest fossil-bearing shale extends many kilometers beyond Walcott9s site. This summer, a host of Cambrian creepie-crawlies—including a mysterious, alien-looking creature team has nicknamed the mothership—spilled out of rocks in Canada9s Kootenay National Park.
