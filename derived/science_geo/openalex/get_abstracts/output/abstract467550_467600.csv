https://openalex.org/W2168020443,"We investigated how complement activation promotes tissue injury and organ dysfunction during acute inflammation. Three models of acute lung injury (ALI) induced by LPS, IgG immune complexes, or C5a were used in C57BL/6 mice, all models requiring availability of both C5a receptors (C5aR and C5L2) for full development of ALI. Ligation of C5aR and C5L2 with C5a triggered the appearance of histones (H3 and H4) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). BALF from humans with ALI contained H4 histone. Histones were absent in control BALF from healthy volunteers. In mice with ALI, in vivo neutralization of H4 with IgG antibody reduced the intensity of ALI. Neutrophil depletion in mice with ALI markedly reduced H4 presence in BALF and was highly protective. The direct lung damaging effects of extracellular histones were demonstrated by airway administration of histones into mice and rats (Sprague-Dawley), which resulted in ALI that was C5a receptor-independent, and associated with intense inflammation, PMN accumulation, damage/destruction of alveolar epithelial cells, together with release into lung of cytokines/chemokines. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated lung damage, edema and consolidation in histone-injured lungs. These studies confirm the destructive C5a-dependent effects in lung linked to appearance of extracellular histones."

Inhibition of CXCR7 with either small molecules or small interference (si)RNA has shown promising therapeutic benefits in several tumor models. With the increased interest and effectiveness of biologicals inhibiting membrane-bound receptors we made use of the ""Nanobody platform"" to target CXCR7. Previously we showed that Nanobodies, i.e. immunoglobulin single variable domains derived from naturally occurring heavy chain-only camelids antibodies, represent new biological tools to efficiently tackle difficult drug targets such as G protein-coupled receptors. In this study we developed and characterized highly selective and potent Nanobodies against CXCR7. Interestingly, the CXCR7-targeting Nanobodies displayed antagonistic properties in contrast with previously reported CXCR7-targeting agents. Several high affinity CXCR7-specific Nanobodies potently inhibited CXCL12-induced β-arrestin2 recruitment in vitro. A wide variety of tumor biopsies was profiled, showing for the first time high expression of CXCR7 in head and neck cancer. Using a patient-derived CXCR7-expressing head and neck cancer xenograft model in nude mice, tumor growth was inhibited by CXCR7-targeting Nanobody therapy. Mechanistically, CXCR7-targeting Nanobodies did not inhibit cell cycle progression but instead reduced secretion of the angiogenic chemokine CXCL1 from head and neck cancer cells in vitro, thus acting here as inverse agonists, and subsequent angiogenesis in vivo. Hence, with this novel class of CXCR7 inhibitors, we further substantiate the therapeutic relevance of targeting CXCR7 in head and neck cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2044322590,"Observations of ocean-terminating outlet glaciers in Greenland and West Antarctica indicate that their contribution to sea level is accelerating as a result of increased velocity, thinning and retreat. Thinning has also been reported along the margin of the much larger East Antarctic ice sheet, but whether glaciers are advancing or retreating there is largely unknown, and there has been no attempt to place such changes in the context of localized mass loss or climatic or oceanic forcing. Here we present multidecadal trends in the terminus position of 175 ocean-terminating outlet glaciers along 5,400 kilometres of the margin of the East Antarctic ice sheet, and reveal widespread and synchronous changes. Despite large fluctuations between glaciers--linked to their size--three epochal patterns emerged: 63 per cent of glaciers retreated from 1974 to 1990, 72 per cent advanced from 1990 to 2000, and 58 per cent advanced from 2000 to 2010. These trends were most pronounced along the warmer western South Pacific coast, whereas glaciers along the cooler Ross Sea coast experienced no significant changes. We find that glacier change along the Pacific coast is consistent with a rapid and coherent response to air temperature and sea-ice trends, linked through the dominant mode of atmospheric variability (the Southern Annular Mode). We conclude that parts of the world's largest ice sheet may be more vulnerable to external forcing than recognized previously."
https://openalex.org/W2131648255,"Epigenetic changes play significant roles in the development of cancer. UHRF1, as an epigenetic regulator, has been shown to be overexpressed and to coordinate tumor suppressor gene silencing in several cancers. However, the role and underlying mechanism of UHRF1 in gastric cancer (GC) progression remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of UHRF1 in GC metastasis and explored its upstream regulatory mechanisms at the microRNA level. UHRF1 was overexpressed in GC tissues, especially in metastatic ones, and a high level of UHRF1 expression predicted poor survival. The down-regulation of UHRF1 suppressed GC invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. We identified and verified miR-146a and miR-146b as direct upstream regulators of UHRF1. Furthermore, the restoration of miR-146a/b dramatically reduced the expression of UHRF1 through the direct targeting of its 3'-UTR, and this effect in turn reactivated the slit homologue 3 (Slit3), cadherin 4 (CDH4), and runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) genes via promoter demethylation. Finally, analyses of miR-146a/b and UHRF1 levels in human GC tissues revealed that miR-146a/b correlated inversely with UHRF1 expression. These findings describe a new mechanism for the regulation of UHRF1 and aberrant DNA hypermethylation in GC. The newly identified miR-146a/b/UHRF1 axis provides insight into the GC metastasis process, and targeting this novel axis represents a therapeutic approach to blocking GC metastasis."

We identified a miR-433 seed match region in human and mouse CREB1 3′-UTRs. Overexpression of miR-433 markedly decreased human CREB1 3′-UTR reporter activity, and the inhibitory effect of miR-433 was alleviated upon mutation of its binding site. Ectopic expression of miR-433 reduced CREB1 protein levels in a variety of human and mouse cancer cells, including HeLa, Hepa1, Huh7, and HepG2. Human CREB1 protein levels in highly invasive MHCC97H cells were diminished by expression of miR-433 but were induced by miR-433 antagomir (anti-miR-433). The expression of mouse CREB1 protein negatively correlated with miR-433 levels in nuclear receptor Shp−/− liver tissues and liver tumors compared with wild-type mice. miR-433 exhibited a significant repression of MHCC97H cell migration, which was reversed by anti-miR-433. Overexpressing miR-433 inhibited focus formation dramatically, demonstrating that miR-433 may exert a tumor suppressor function. Knockdown of CREB1 by siRNAs impeded MHCC97H cell migration and invasion and antagonized the effect of anti-miR-433. Interestingly, CREB1 siRNA decreased MHCC97H cell proliferation, which was not influenced by anti-miR-433. Overexpressing CREB1 decreased the inhibitory activity of miR-433. The CpG islands surrounding miR-433 were hypermethylated, and the DNA methylation agent 5′-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, but not the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, drastically stimulated the expression of miR-433 and miR-127 in HCC cells. The latter is clustered with miR-433. The results reveal a critical role of miR-433 in mediating HCC cell migration via CREB1. Although its expression is altered in several human diseases, the function of miR-433 is unknown. Results: miR-433 inhibits HCC cell migration by repressing CREB1 3′-UTR activity and protein expression. Conclusion: CREB1 is the first identified target of miR-433 in liver cancer.

The knock-out of HSF1 impairs cancer formation and progression, suggesting that HSF1 is a promising therapeutic target. To identify inhibitors of HSF1 activity, we performed cell-based screening with a library of marketed and experimental drugs and identified cantharidin as an HSF1 inhibitor. Cantharidin is a potent antitumor agent from traditional Chinese medicine. Cantharidin inhibited heat shock-induced luciferase activity with an IC50 of 4.2 μm. In contrast, cantharidin did not inhibit NF-κB luciferase reporter activity, demonstrating that cantharidin is not a general transcription inhibitor. When the HCT-116 colorectal cancer cells were exposed to heat shock in the presence of cantharidin, the induction of HSF1 downstream target proteins, such as HSP70 and BAG3 (Bcl-2-associated athanogene domain 3), was suppressed. HSP70 and its co-chaperone BAG3 have been reported to protect cells from apoptosis by stabilizing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. As expected, treating HCT-116 cancer cells with cantharidin significantly decreased the amounts of BCL-2, BCL-xL, and MCL-1 protein and induced apoptotic cell death. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that cantharidin inhibited the binding of HSF1 to the HSP70 promoter and subsequently blocked HSF1-dependent p-TEFb recruitment. Therefore, the p-TEFb-dependent phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II was blocked, arresting transcription at the elongation step. Protein phosphatase 2A inhibition with PP2CA siRNA or okadaic acid did not block HSF1 activity, suggesting that cantharidin inhibits HSF1 in a protein phosphatase 2A-independent manner. We show for the first time that cantharidin inhibits HSF1 transcriptional activity. HSF1 is a transcription factor that enhances cancer formation and progression. Results: Cantharidin inhibited the binding of HSF1 to the HSP70 promoter and subsequently blocked HSF1-dependent HSP70 expression.

We show for the first time that cantharidin inhibits HSF1 transcriptional activity. Cancer cells are characterized by genetic mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors. In many cases, cancer cells become dependent on oncogenes for tumor initiation and progression, which is termed oncogene addiction (1.Weinstein I.B. Cancer. Addiction to oncogenes–the Achilles heal of cancer.Science. 2002; 297: 63-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Most anticancer drug-screening programs have focused on these oncogenes. However, cancer cells are still heavily dependent on specific signaling pathways that are independent of oncogenic pathways (2.Luo J. Solimini N.L. Elledge S.J. Principles of cancer therapy: oncogene and non-oncogene addiction.Cell. 2009; 136: 823-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar), such as the molecular chaperone pathway (3.Solimini N.L. Luo J. Elledge S.J. Non-oncogene addiction and the stress phenotype of cancer cells.Cell. 2007; 130: 986-988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Mutations in the cancer genome can result in suboptimal conformations for cellular proteins. In addition, cancer cells are exposed to high levels of reactive oxygen species (4.Szatrowski T.P. Nathan C.F. Production of large amounts of hydrogen peroxide by human tumor cells.Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 794-798PubMed Google Scholar), which makes them highly dependent on molecular chaperone activity; this is an example of nononcogene addiction. The heat shock response is a protective mechanism against a wide range of stresses, including heat shock, oxidative stress, heavy metals, fever, or protein misfolding (5.Morimoto R.I. Proteotoxic stress and inducible chaperone networks in neurodegenerative disease and aging.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 6.Shamovsky I. Nudler E. New insights into the mechanism of heat shock response activation.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The heat shock response is largely mediated by heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1). 3The abbreviations used are: HSF1heat shock factor 1p-TEFbpositive transcription elongation factor bPP2Aprotein phosphatase 2ABAG3Bcl-2-associated athanogene domain 3ChIPChromatin immunoprecipitationpol IIRNA polymerase IICTDC-terminal domain17-AAG17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycinHSPheat shock protein. Although heat shock proteins (HSPs) are only induced transiently upon stress, HSPs are often constitutively overexpressed in tumors. The expression of hsp70 is induced by several oncogenes such as H-rasval12 (7.Stanhill A. Levin V. Hendel A. Shachar I. Kazanov D. Arber N. Kaminski N. Engelberg D. Ha-ras(Val12) induces HSP70b transcription via the HSE/HSF1 system, but HSP70b expression is suppressed in Ha-ras(Val12)-transformed cells.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 1485-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), c-myc (8.Kingston R.E.

The down-regulation of HSP70 was found to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis (10.Guo F. Rocha K. Bali P. Pranpat M. Fiskus W. Boyapalle S. Kumaraswamy S. Balasis M. Greedy B.

Similar results were reported when HSP27 was down-regulated (11.Rocchi P. Beraldi E. Ettinger S. Fazli L. Vessella R.L. Nelson C. Gleave M. Increased Hsp27 after androgen ablation facilitates androgen-independent progression in prostate cancer via signal transducers and activators of transcription 3-mediated suppression of apoptosis.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 11083-11093Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). HSF1 knockdown inhibited the viability of malignant cancer cell lines but did not affect a normal cell line (12.Dai C. Whitesell L. Rogers A.B. Lindquist S. Heat shock factor 1 is a powerful multifaceted modifier of carcinogenesis.Cell. 2007; 130: 1005-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). In the case of HeLa cancer cells, viability was inhibited more than 90% by HSF1 shRNA. Bcl-2 family proteins are key regulators of apoptosis and consist of both anti- and pro-apoptotic members. The oligomerization of pro-apoptotic members Bak and Bax causes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, allowing the release of cytochrome c and the subsequent activation of caspases. Anti-apoptotic members, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, and Mcl-1, bind to pro-apoptotic members and prevent their oligomerization (13.Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Prevention of apoptosis by Bcl-2: release of cytochrome c from mitochondria blocked.Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar). Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins have emerged as key therapeutic targets, and small molecule Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitors, such as ABT-236 and ABT-737, are now in early clinical trials (14.Tse C. Shoemaker A.R. Adickes J. Anderson M.G. Chen J. Jin S. Johnson E.F. Marsh K.C. Mitten M.J. Nimmer P. Roberts L. Tahir S.K. Xiao Y. Yang X. Zhang H. Fesik S. Rosenberg S.H. Elmore S.W. ABT-263: a potent and orally bioavailable Bcl-2 family inhibitor.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 3421-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). Although ABT-236 has clinical activity in Bcl-2-dependent tumors, many tumors are not dependent on Bcl-2 but depend instead on Mcl-1. The overexpression of Mcl-1 is a common mechanism of resistance against ABT-737 in cancer cells (15.van Delft M.F. Wei A.H. Mason K.D. Vandenberg C.J. Chen L. Czabotar P.E. Willis S.N. Scott C.L.

Furthermore, the amplification of the Mcl-1 locus is one of the most frequent somatic genetic events in human cancer (18.Beroukhim R. Mermel C.H. Porter D. Wei G. Raychaudhuri S. Donovan J. Barretina J. Boehm J.S. Dobson J. Urashima M. Mc Henry K.T. Pinchback R.M. Ligon A.H. Cho Y.J. Haery L. Greulich H. Reich M. Winckler W. Lawrence M.S. Weir B.A. Tanaka K.E. Chiang D.Y. Bass A.J.

Getz G. Sellers W.R. Meyerson M. The landscape of somatic copy-number alteration across human cancers.Nature. 2010; 463: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (2682) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the development of dual inhibitors against both Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 is more promising than specific inhibitors that target one or the other. The Bcl-2-associated athanogene 1 (BAG1) family was identified as a Bcl-2-interacting protein and was found to enhance survival (19.Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cloning and functional analysis of BAG-1: a novel Bcl-2-binding protein with anti-cell death activity.Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Six BAG family members were reported to regulate HSP70/HSC70 function either positively or negatively. BAG-1 interacts with the proteasome and increases HSP70 client protein degradation (20.Lüders J. Demand J. Höhfeld J. The ubiquitin-related BAG-1 provides a link between the molecular chaperones Hsc70/Hsp70 and the proteasome.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4613-4617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). BAG3 inhibits the proteasomal degradation of HSP70 clients (21.Doong H. Rizzo K. Fang S. Kulpa V.

Chem. 2003; 278: 28490-28500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BAG3 is an HSF1-inducible gene and has a role in enhancing cancer cell survival by stabilizing the Bcl-2 family proteins, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 (22.Jacobs A.T. Marnett L.J. HSF1-mediated BAG3 expression attenuates apoptosis in 4-hydroxynonenal-treated colon cancer cells via stabilization of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins.J. Biol.

The dried bodies of these beetles have been used in Chinese traditional medicine for the treatment of cancer for over 2000 years (23.Wang G.S. Medical uses of mylabris in ancient China and recent studies.J. Ethnopharmacol. 1989; 26: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Insects produce a large number of defensive molecules against predators, and these compounds have the potential to be used as medicinal drugs. Several groups reported that cantharidin induced apoptosis in hepatoma (24.Wang C.C. Wu C.H. Hsieh K.J. Yen K.Y. Yang L.L. Cytotoxic effects of cantharidin on the growth of normal and carcinoma cells.Toxicology. 2000; 147: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), multiple myeloma (25.Sagawa M. Nakazato T.

Ko S.W. Tsai H.Y. Chung J.G. Chiang J.H. Chen K.T. Chen Y.C. Chen H.Y. Chen Y.F. Yang J.S. Cantharidin induces G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in human colorectal cancer Colo 205 cells through inhibition of CDK1 activity and caspase-dependent signaling pathways.Int. J. Oncol. 2011; 38: 1067-1073PubMed Google Scholar). However, the clinical application of cantharidin is limited because of its toxicity. To reduce the toxicity of cantharidin, liposome-encapsulated cantharidin was synthesized and tested for its anticancer activity in vivo (29.Chang C.C. Liu D.Z. Lin S.Y. Liang H.J. Hou W.C. Huang W.J. Chang C.H. Ho F.M. Liang Y.C. Liposome encapsulation reduces cantharidin toxicity.Food Chem. Toxicol. 2008; 46: 3116-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). PEG-liposomal cantharidin (5 mg/kg) significantly inhibited tumor growth in nude mice by ∼75%, suggesting that cantharidin possesses highly effective antitumor activity. In addition, a diluted solution of cantharidin can be used as a topical medication to remove warts (30.Epstein W.L. Kligman A.M. Treatment of warts with cantharidin.A.M.A. Arch. Dermatol. 1958; 77: 508-511Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified cantharidin as an HSF1 inhibitor. Cantharidin down-regulates the levels of not only Bcl-2/Bcl-xL but also Mcl-1 by blocking HSF1-dependent HSP70/BAG3 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the inhibition of HSF1 activity occurs by blocking HSF1 binding to target gene promoters. This is the first report that the anticancer activity of cantharidin involves HSF1 inhibition. The Spectrum CollectionTM chemical library was purchased from MicroSource Discovery Systems, Inc.

A549 (small cell lung cancer cell), PC-3 (human prostate cancer), DU 145 (human prostate cancer), and MDA-MB-231 (human breast cancer) were cultured in RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen). All culture media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen). Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in an incubator. p(HSE)4-TA-Luc plasmid was constructed as reported previously (31.Yoon Y.J. Kim J.A. Shin K.D. Shin D.S. Han Y.M. Lee Y.J.

The activity of the reporter was measured using a Dual-LuciferaseTM reporter system (Promega, Madison, WI). HCT-116 cancer cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells in 100 × 20-mm culture dishes. Cells were co-transfected with 9 μg of p(HSE)4-TA-Luc vector and 1 μg of pRL-TK vector containing the Renilla luciferase gene as an internal control. The transfection was performed using TransFection (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Five hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized and seeded onto sterilized black-bottom 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well. After incubation for 24 h, cells were pretreated with chemicals for 30 min, exposed to heat shock at 44 °C for 20 min, and then incubated further at 37 °C for 5 h. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a dual-light reporter gene assay kit (Promega). Cells were seeded onto 96-well plates at a density of 6 × 103 cells per well in McCoy's 5A medium with 10% FBS. After 24 h, the medium was replenished with fresh complete medium containing cantharidin, norcantharidin, or 0.1% DMSO. After incubation for 48 h, the cell proliferation reagent WST-1 (Dojindo, Japan) was added to each well. The amount of WST-1 formazan produced was measured at 450 nm using an ELISA reader (Bio-Rad). Cells were treated with either no heat or heat in the presence of different concentrations (1, 5, and 10 μm) of cantharidin. Cells were then fixed by adding formaldehyde (Sigma) to the medium to a final concentration of 1.5% for 15 min, after which glycine was added to a final concentration of 125 mm. The cells were then scraped and centrifuged for 5 min at 240 × g at room temperature. Pelleted cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and protease inhibitors) and incubated for 10 min on ice. After incubation, chromatin was sheared by sonication. After the removal of nuclear debris by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the lysates were diluted 10-fold with ChIP Dilution Buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl) and then precleared for 30 min using 30 μl of Salmon Sperm DNA/protein A-agarose (Millipore). Immunoprecipitation was carried out at 4 °C overnight, and immune complexes were collected with Salmon Sperm DNA/protein A-agarose (Millipore). Antibodies used included anti-HSF1 (StressGen, SPA-901), anti-CDK9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8338 (H-169)), or preimmune rabbit serum as a control for nonspecific interaction. After washing three times with Low Salt Immune Complex Wash Buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), High Salt Immune Complex Wash Buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), LiCl Immune Complex Wash Buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and twice with TE Buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), immunocomplexes were eluted with Elution Buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). Protein-DNA cross-links were reversed by incubating at 65 °C for 4 h. After proteinase K digestion, DNA was extracted with a PCR purification kit (Bioneer). Real time RT-PCR analysis was performed with the iQTM5 thermocycler (Bio-Rad), using FastStart SYBR Green Master (Roche Applied Science) to prepare the reaction mixtures. The primers used for real time PCR of human hsp70 genes were as follows: HSF1 ChIP assay, HSP70A forward primer, 5′-CACTCCCCCTTCCTCTCAG-3′, and HSP70A reverse primer, 5′-TTCCCTTCTGAGCCAATCAC-3′; and p-TEFb ChIP assay, HSP70A forward primer, 5′-GAAAAGGCGGGTCTCCGTGACG-3′, and HSP70A reverse primer, 5′-GGTTCGCTCTGGGAAGCCTTGG-3′. The relative quantities of HSP70 promoter were normalized to the input DNA. Data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. of triplicate samples. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Two micrograms of isolated RNA for each sample was reverse-transcribed with TOPscriptTM RT DryMIX(dT18) kit (EnzynoMicsTM) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real time PCR was performed using IQTM SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions using an iQ5 real time PCR detection system. The following primers were used for RT-PCR: HSP70 forward primer, 5′-ACCAAGCAGACGCAGATCTTC-3′, and HSP70 reverse primer, 5′-CGCCCTCGTACACCTGGAT-3′; HSP47 forward primer, 5′-CGCCATGTTCTTCAAGCCA-3′, and HSP47 reverse primer, 5′-CATGAAGCCACGGTTGTCC-3′; HSP27 forward primer, 5′-GGCATTTCTGGATGTGAGCC-3′, and HSP27 reverse primer, 5′-AGCAGGCAGGACATAGGTGC-3′; Mcl-1 forward primer, 5′-AGGCTGGGATGGGTTTGTG-3′, and Mcl-1 reverse primer, 5′-CACATTCCTGATGCCACCTTCT-3′; Bcl-2 forward primer, 5′-CTGCACCTGACGCCCTTCACC-3′, and Bcl-2 reverse primer, 5′-CACATGACCCCACCGAACTCAAAGA-3′; Bcl-xL forward primer, 5′-GGTACCGGCGGGCATTCAGTG-3′, and Bcl-xL reverse primer, 5′-AAGTATCCCAGCCGCCGTTCTCC-3′; BAG3 forward primer, 5′-ATGCAGCGATTCCGAACTGAG-3′, and BAG3 reverse primer, 5′-AGGATGAGCAGTCAGAGGCAG-3′; GAPDH forward primer, 5′-GGGAGCCAAAAGGGTCATCATCTC-3′, and GAPDH reverse primer, 5′-CCATGCCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTC-3′. The relative quantities of HSP70 mRNA were normalized against GAPDH mRNA. Twenty micrograms of total protein was resolved by 7.5 or 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). Proteins were detected with the indicated primary antibodies. The secondary antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and anti-rat IgG from Jackson ImmunoResearch. The antibodies were used at the dilution recommended by the manufacturers. The membrane was incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature, washed five times with TBS-T, and visualized with LuminataTM Forte Western HRP Substrate (Millipore). Blots were imaged using the ImageQuant LAS 4000, and protein band densities were analyzed using the MultiGauge version 3.0 software provided with the ImageQuant LAS 4000. For immunoprecipitation, 800 μg of lysates were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C with rotation, and then 50 μl of protein G magnetic beads (Millipore) was added. After 1 h, the lysates were removed, and beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer. Bead-bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected using specific antibodies. HCT-116 cancer cells were treated with cantharidin at various concentrations for 48 h. Cells were then harvested by trypsinization, fixed with 70% chilled ethanol, and preserved at −20 °C before FACS analysis. Fixed cells were washed three times with PBS solution before being suspended in 500 μl of PBS and treated with 100 mg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min. Propidium iodide was added to a final concentration of 50 mg/ml for DNA staining, and 20,000 fixed cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur system (BD Biosciences). The cell cycle distribution was analyzed using the ModFit program (BD Biosciences). Cells were seeded onto 100 × 20-mm plates at a density of 2 × 106 cells in McCoy's 5A medium with 10% FBS. After 24 h, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts were isolated using the NE-PER kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A volume of samples corresponding to 20 μg was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore). Proteins were detected with the indicated primary antibodies. The secondary antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The blots were developed with LuminataTM Forte Western HRP Substrate (Millipore). Human PP2CA small interfering RNAs were synthesized as duplexes (Bioneer Inc., Korea) with the sequence 5′-AUGGAACUUGACGAUACUCUA-3′. The negative control siRNA, 5′-CCUACGCCACCAAUUUCGU-3′, was purchased from Bioneer Inc. (Korea). HCT-116 cancer cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells per well on 60 × 15-mm plates and incubated for 18 h. Cells were then transfected with 10 nm PP2CA siRNA and the control siRNA duplexes, described above, after incubation for 20 min with Oligofectamine RNAi Max (Invitrogen) in serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Twenty four hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10% FBS and incubated for an additional 24 h. A structurally diverse library of 2,000 compounds was screened to identify HSF1 inhibitory chemicals. This chemical library is composed of marketed and experimental drugs and natural products. We used the p(HSE)4-TA-Luc cell-based reporter assay system previously reported (31.Yoon Y.J. Kim J.A. Shin K.D. Shin D.S. Han Y.M. Lee Y.J. Lee J.S. Kwon B.M. Han D.C.

Cantharidin ((3aR,7aS)-3a,7a-dimethylhexahydro-4,7-epoxyisobenzofuran-1,3-dione) was identified as a hit compound (Fig. 1B) and was therefore characterized further. Cantharidin is a potent anticancer agent from traditional Chinese medicine. The effect of cantharidin on heat shock-induced luciferase activity in HCT-116 cancer cells transfected with p(HSE)4-TA-Luc was investigated. There was an ∼42-fold induction of luciferase activity in response to heat shock in HCT-116 cancer cells (Fig. 1A). Cantharidin inhibited heat shock-induced luciferase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, with 50% inhibition at 4.2 μm. Norcantharidin (7-oxabicyclo [2.2.1] heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride) (Fig. 1B) is a structural analog of cantharidin, which showed very weak inhibitory activity compared with cantharidin.

https://openalex.org/W1967481978,"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells exposed to abiotic stresses (e.g. nitrogen, zinc, or phosphorus deficiency) accumulate triacylglycerols (TAG), which are stored in lipid droplets. Here, we report that iron starvation leads to formation of lipid droplets and accumulation of TAGs. This occurs between 12 and 24 h after the switch to iron-starvation medium. C. reinhardtii cells deprived of iron have more saturated fatty acid (FA), possibly due to the loss of function of FA desaturases, which are iron-requiring enzymes with diiron centers. The abundance of a plastid acyl-ACP desaturase (FAB2) is decreased to the same degree as ferredoxin. Ferredoxin is a substrate of the desaturases and has been previously shown to be a major target of the iron deficiency response. The increase in saturated FA (C16:0 and C18:0) is concomitant with the decrease in unsaturated FA (C16:4, C18:3, or C18:4). This change was gradual for diacylglyceryl-N,N,N-trimethylhomoserine (DGTS) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), whereas the monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) FA profile remained stable during the first 12 h, whereas MGDG levels were decreasing over the same period of time. These changes were detectable after only 2 h of iron starvation. On the other hand, DGTS and DGDG contents gradually decreased until a minimum was reached after 24-48 h. RNA-Seq analysis of iron-starved C. reinhardtii cells revealed notable changes in many transcripts coding for enzymes involved in FA metabolism. The mRNA abundances of genes coding for components involved in TAG accumulation (diacylglycerol acyltransferases or major lipid droplet protein) were increased. A more dramatic increase at the transcript level has been observed for many lipases, suggesting that major remodeling of lipid membranes occurs during iron starvation in C. reinhardtii."

At least five can deaminate mitochondrial DNA in the cytoplasm, while three can deaminate viral DNA in the nucleus. However, only one, APOBEC3A, can hypermutate genomic DNA. We analysed the distribution and function of the two APOBEC3A isoforms p1 and p2 in transfected cell lines. Both can translocate to the nucleus and hypermutate CMYC DNA and induce DNA double strand breaks as visualized by the detection of ©H2AX or Chk2. APOBEC3A induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest and triggered several members of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Activation of purified human CD4+ T lymphocytes with PHA, IL2 and interferon α resulted in C->T hypermutation of genomic DNA and double stranded breaks suggesting a role for APOBEC3A in pro-inflammatory conditions. As chronic inflammation underlies many diseases including numerous cancers, it is possible that APOBEC3A induction may generate many of the lesions typical of a cancer genome."
https://openalex.org/W1978948771,"Membrane fusion at eukaryotic organelles is initiated by Rab GTPases and tethering factors. Rabs in their GDP-bound form are kept soluble in the cytoplasm by the GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) chaperone. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) are found at organelles and are critical for Rab function. Here, we surveyed the overall role of GEFs in Rab localization. We show that GEFs, but none of the proposed GDI displacement factors, are essential for the correct membrane localization of yeast Rabs. In the absence of the GEF, Rabs lost their primary localization to the target organelle. Several Rabs, such as vacuolar Ypt7, were found at the endoplasmic reticulum and thus were still membrane-bound. Surprisingly, a Ypt7 mutant that undergoes facilitated nucleotide exchange localized to vacuoles independently of its GEF Mon1-Ccz1 and rescued vacuole morphology. In contrast, wild-type Ypt7 required its GEF for localization and to counteract the extraction by GDI. Our data agree with the emerging model that GEFs are critical for Rab localization but raise the possibility that additional factors can contribute to this process."

The structure of a secretable LOX from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa_LOX), the first available from a prokaryote, presents significant differences with respect to eukaryotic LOXs, including a cluster of helices acting as a lid to the active center. The mobility of the lid and the structural variability of the N-terminal region of Pa_LOX was confirmed by comparing 2 crystal forms. The binding pocket contains a phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipid with branches of 18 (sn-1) and 14/16 (sn-2) carbon atoms in length. Carbon atoms from the sn-1 chain approach the catalytic iron in a manner that sheds light on how the enzymatic reaction might proceed. The findings in these studies suggest that Pa_LOX has the capacity to extract and modify unsaturated phospholipids from eukaryotic membranes, allowing this LOX to play a role in the interaction of P. aeruginosa with host cells.—Garreta, A., Val-Moraes, S.

https://openalex.org/W2041855679,"Objective In multicellular organisms, cell division is regulated by growth factors (GFs). In the absence of GFs, cells exit the cell cycle at a site in G1 referred to as the restriction point (R) and enter a state of quiescence known as G0. Additionally, nutrient availability impacts on G1 cell cycle progression. While there is a vast literature on G1 cell cycle progression, confusion remains – especially with regard to the temporal location of R relative to nutrient-mediated checkpoints. In this report, we have investigated the relationship between R and a series of metabolic cell cycle checkpoints that regulate passage into S-phase. Methods We used double-block experiments to order G1 checkpoints that monitor the presence of GFs, essential amino acids (EEAs), the conditionally essential amino acid glutamine, and inhibition of mTOR. Cell cycle progression was monitored by uptake of [3H]-thymidine and flow cytometry, and analysis of cell cycle regulatory proteins was by Western-blot. Results We report here that the GF-mediated R can be temporally distinguished from a series of late G1 metabolic checkpoints mediated by EAAs, glutamine, and mTOR – the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin. R is clearly upstream from an EAA checkpoint, which is upstream from a glutamine checkpoint. mTOR is downstream from both the amino acid checkpoints, close to S-phase. Significantly, in addition to GF autonomy, we find human cancer cells also have dysregulated metabolic checkpoints. Conclusion The data provided here are consistent with a GF-dependent mid-G1 R where cells determine whether it is appropriate to divide, followed by a series of late-G1 metabolic checkpoints mediated by amino acids and mTOR where cells determine whether they have sufficient nutrients to accomplish the task. Since mTOR inhibition arrests cells the latest in G1, it is likely the final arbiter for nutrient sufficiency prior to committing to replicating the genome."
https://openalex.org/W1986987962,"Human aging is associated with a progressive loss of muscle mass and strength and a concomitant fat accumulation in form of inter-muscular adipose tissue, causing skeletal muscle function decline and immobilization. Fat accumulation can also occur as intra-muscular triglycerides (IMTG) deposition in lipid droplets, which are associated with perilipin proteins, such as Perilipin2 (Plin2). It is not known whether Plin2 expression changes with age and if this has consequences on muscle mass and strength. We studied the expression of Plin2 in the vastus lateralis (VL) muscle of both healthy subjects and patients affected by lower limb mobility limitation of different age. We found that Plin2 expression increases with age, this phenomenon being particularly evident in patients. Moreover, Plin2 expression is inversely correlated with quadriceps strength and VL thickness. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon, we focused on IGF-1/p53 network/signalling pathway, involved in muscle physiology. We found that Plin2 expression strongly correlates with increased p53 activation and reduced IGF-1 expression. To confirm these observations made on humans, we studied mice overexpressing muscle-specific IGF-1, which are protected from sarcopenia. These mice resulted almost negative for the expression of Plin2 and p53 at two years of age. We conclude that fat deposition within skeletal muscle in form of Plin2-coated lipid droplets increases with age and is associated with decreased muscle strength and thickness, likely through an IGF-1- and p53-dependent mechanism. The data also suggest that excessive intramuscular fat accumulation could be the initial trigger for p53 activation and consequent loss of muscle mass and strength."

Adaptive metabolic responses to sepsis can prevent bioenergetic failure and death. These studies were aimed at investigating the influence of sepsis on mitochondrial homeostasis, focusing on removal of dysfunctional mitochondria and restitution of a healthy mitochondrial population. These data demonstrate decreased hepatic oxidative phosphorylation by 31 ± 11% following murine cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) at 8 h and 34 ± 9% following LPS treatment in vitro at 12 h (P<0.05). In addition, there was a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Mitochondrial density and number initially decreased (relative area per micrograph of 64±10% at baseline vs. 39±13% at 8 h following LPS; P<0.05) and was associated with an increase in autophagy and mitophagy. CLP-induced markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial number and density recovered over time. Furthermore, these data suggest that mitochondrial biogenesis was dependent on an autophagy and mitochondrial DNA/Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) signaling pathway. These results suggest that hepatocyte survival and maintenance of function in sepsis is dependent on a mitochondrial homeostasis pathway marked by mitophagy and biogenesis."

Upon transferring disulfide bonds to incoming client proteins, PDI can be efficiently reoxidized by members of the Ero1 family (Ero1α and Ero1β in mammals). As these flavoproteins use oxygen as an electron acceptor generating hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct, the question arose as to how professional secretory cells could fold abundant proteins rich in disulfide bonds with limiting oxidative stress. A solution of this paradox came with the discovery that peroxiredoxin 4 (Prx4) can promote de novo disulfide bond formation by utilizing hydrogen peroxide (13.Zito E. Melo E.P. Yang Y. Wahlander Å.

Furthermore, it has been recently revealed that mice with double knock-out of both oxidases exhibit lower birth rate and scurvy, whereas mice with single knock-out (Ero1 or Prx4) exhibit modest effect, indicating mutual complementarity between Ero1 and Prx4 (15.Zito E.

Cell. 2012; 48: 39-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, neither Prx4 nor Ero1 contains known ER retention signals (supplemental Fig. 1). Ero1α interacts with PDI and ERp44 (16.Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R.

Bertoli G. Fagioli C. Guerini-Rocco E. Nerini-Molteni S. Ruffato E. Sitia R. Dynamic retention of Ero1α and Ero1β in the endoplasmic reticulum by interactions with PDI and ERp44.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been unclear how Prx4 is retained in the ER (21.Kakihana T. Nagata K. Sitia R. Peroxides and peroxidases in the endoplasmic reticulum: integrating redox homeostasis and oxidative folding.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2012; 16: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the mechanisms that control the intracellular localization of Prx4. Our findings reveal that Prx4 shares a similar stepwise retention mechanism with Ero1α, in which ERp44 functions as a backup for PDI; when PDI is down-regulated, Ero1α and Prx4 are retained by ERp44 in the downstream compartment of the ER. Such dynamic regulation of two main ER oxidases seems important for maintaining redox homeostasis in the ESC because the expression of Ero1α and Prx4 endowed with KDEL motifs caused hyperoxidizing environment in the ER. HeLa and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The primary antibodies used in the experiments were: mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland), mouse monoclonal anti-HA (Cell Signaling Technology), mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich), mouse monoclonal anti-Prx4 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), mouse monoclonal anti-Ero1α (Abcam for Western blot and Santa Cruz Biotechnology for immunofluorescence), mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (Millipore), mouse monoclonal anti-ERGIC53 (Enzo Chemical Laboratories), rabbit polyclonal anti-ERp46 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), chicken polyclonal anti-P5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-PDI (StressGen Biotechnologies Corp.), rabbit polyclonal anti-ERp44 (reported by Ronzoni et al.

The secondary antibodies used in the experiments were: HRP-anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit or -mouse, and Alexa Fluor 546 anti-rabbit or -mouse (Invitrogen). Human Prx4, PDI (wild type or AA mutant), or Ero1α (wild type or C94A mutant) cDNA with a FLAG tag or with a FLAG tag and KDEL sequence at the C terminus was generated by PCR from a Matchmaker Pretransformed Human HeLa library (Clontech) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1. The vectors for the expression of HA-ERp44-WT, C29S, and HA-ERp57 were as described previously (9.Anelli T. Alessio M. Bachi A. Bergamelli L. Bertoli G. Camerini S. Mezghrani A. Ruffato E. Simmen T. Sitia R. Thiol-mediated protein retention in the endoplasmic reticulum: the role of ERp44.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5015-5022Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). DsRed2-ER was purchased from Clontech. ERp44 C29A was generated by site-directed mutagenesis: (forward, 5′-GTA AAT TTT ATG CTG ACT GGG CTC GTT TCA GTC AGA TGT TGC-3′; reverse, GCA ACA TCT GAC TGA AAC GAG CCC AGT CAG CAT AAA AAT TTA C-3′). The ER-targeted redox-sensitive GFP iE variant (ERroGFPiE) was generated from ERroGFPiL (kind gift from Prof. Neil J. Bulleid) by site-directed mutagenesis: (forward, 5′-GGA ATA CAA CTA TAA CTG CGA AAG CAA TGT ATA CAT CAC GGC AG-3′; reverse, 5′-CTG CCG TGA TGT ATA CAT TGC TTT CGC AGT TAT AGT TGT ATT CC-3′). Plasmids and siRNAs were transfected using Effectene® (Qiagen) or Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For secretion assays, cells were incubated in Opti-MEM for an additional 4–6 h. Secreted materials were precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or immunoprecipitated with antibodies and then resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions. For detection of ERroGFPiE, lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP were loaded. Fluorograms or Western blot images were acquired with the ChemiDoc-It imaging system (UVP, Upland, CA) or with the FLA-9000 Starion (Fujifilm Life Science) and quantified with ImageQuant 5.2 as described by Anelli et al. (7.Anelli T. Ceppi S. Bergamelli L. Cortini M. Masciarelli S. Valetti C. Sitia R. Sequential steps and checkpoints in the early exocytic compartment during secretory IgM biogenesis.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4177-4188Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cells were extracted with 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The detergent-soluble fractions of cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot. StealthTM RNA siRNAs were obtained from Invitrogen. The sequences were as follows: siPDI-1, 5′-AAU GGG AGC CAA CUG UUU GCA GUG A-3′; siPDI-2, 5′-AUA AAG UCC AGC AGG UUC UCC UUG G-3′; siERp44-1, 5′-AUA GAG UAU ACC UAU AUU CAC UGG G-3′; siERp44-2, 5′-UUA AUU GCC GAG CUA CUU CAU UCU G-3′; and siEro1α, 5′-GGG CUU UAU CCA AAG UGU UAC CAU U-3′. Medium GC StealthTM RNAi duplexes were used as negative controls. Immunoprecipitation was coupled with custom-made direct nano-flow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system (Tokyo, Japan). FLAG-tagged Prx4 and mutants thereof were expressed in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG. Immunoprecipitates were eluted with FLAG peptides and digested with Lys-C endopeptidase (Achromobacter protease I). Cleaved fragments were directly analyzed by a direct nano-flow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system as described previously (23.Natsume T. Yamauchi Y. Nakayama H. Shinkawa T. Yanagida M. Takahashi N. Isobe T. A direct nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system for interaction proteomics.Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4725-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Assays were repeated at least four times. HeLa cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 5 min followed by incubation in 1% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h and then with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (from Invitrogen Molecular Probes) for 1 h, as indicated. Confocal images were obtained using a LSM 700 confocal microscope and analyzed by the Zen 2009 software (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Recombinant Ero1α and PDI were described previously (17.Araki K.

Functional in vitro analysis of the ERO1 protein and protein-disulfide isomerase pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 32705-32712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Prx4 and ERp44 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen) by induction with 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 6 h just after the A600 reached 0.6. Harvested cells were sonicated in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 20 mm imidazole and 150 mm NaCl. The supernatant from cell lysates was loaded onto a HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with cell suspension buffer and eluted with the same buffer containing 0.5 m imidazole. Eluted fractions were loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200pg isofraction column equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl. Eluted fractions containing oxidoreductases were desalted and loaded onto a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Fractions were eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl. Purified proteins were concentrated and stored at −80 °C. SPR analyses were performed as described previously (17.Araki K. Iemura S. Kamiya Y. Ron D. Kato K. Natsume T. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 2013; 202: 861-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 24.Araki K. Nagata K.

Briefly, association or dissociation rate constants (kon or koff) to immobilized Ero1α (WT) or Prx4 were determined by SPR measurements on a ProteOn XPR36 protein interaction array system (Bio-Rad). Ero1α (WT)/Prx4 were coupled to the GLC sensor chip (Bio-Rad) through amine coupling chemistry. As a control, one channel was coupled with BSA to exclude background binding. Sensorgrams were recorded simultaneously for several concentrations (0.444–36 μm, in a 3-fold dilution series) of purified oxidoreductases at 25 °C for a 2-min association phase followed by a 10-min dissociation phase with 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4 or pH 6.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.001% Tween, and 2 mm EDTA as running and sample buffer. Sensorgrams were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis according to a two-state model by the ProteOn Manager version 3.0 software (Bio-Rad). Experiments were replicated at least three times. All data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance of the difference between groups was evaluated using Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.001. To gain an evolutionary perspective, we searched and statistically analyzed homologous genes of ER oxidoreductases using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (25.Kanehisa M. Goto S. KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (17971) Google Scholar). The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database was also searched for analysis of several sequences (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/). The ER oxidases Ero1α and Prx4 have at least two common features; one is their function in oxidative protein folding, and the other is their lack of intrinsic ER retention signals. Surprisingly, the latter feature is 100% conserved among Ero1α orthologs and 94.4% conserved among Prx4 in vertebrates (KEGG database (25.Kanehisa M. Goto S. KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (17971) Google Scholar)) (supplemental Fig. 1). To identify proteins involved in its subcellular localization, we performed LC-MS/MS analyses of the material co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged Prx4 and identified ERp44, PDI, ERp72, ERp46, and P5 (supplemental Fig. 2) (see also Ref. 18.Jessop C.E. Watkins R.H. Simmons J.J. Tasab M. Bulleid N.J. Protein disulphide isomerase family members show distinct substrate specificity: P5 is targeted to BiP client proteins.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 4287-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), yielding a pattern similar to what is reported for Ero1α. To further compare the interactomes of the two enzymes and provide additional specificity controls, we overexpressed Prx4-FLAG or Ero1α-FLAG in HeLa cells and analyzed the immunoprecipitates obtained with or without prior cross-linking with dithiobis succinimidyl propionate. Western blot analyses of the material specifically eluted with FLAG peptides confirmed that both Prx4 and Ero1α interact with ERp44, PDI, ERp72, P5, and ERp46 (Fig. 1A). The similar binding patterns are in line with coordinated roles of Prx4 and Ero1α in oxidative protein folding (26.Zito E. PRDX4, an endoplasmic reticulum-localized peroxiredoxin at the crossroads between enzymatic oxidative protein folding and nonenzymatic protein oxidation.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2013; 18: 1666-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To confirm that endogenous ERp44 and Prx4 interact in physiological conditions, we analyzed Ig-λ producing J558L murine myeloma cells or a transfectant secreting IgM (J[μs] (27.Fagioli C. Mezghrani A. Sitia R. Reduction of interchain disulfide bonds precedes the dislocation of Ig-μ chains from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40962-40967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)). Clearly, endogenous Prx4 can be co-immunoprecipitated with ERp44 in Ig-secreting cells (Fig. 1B). Next, we investigated whether Ero1α and Prx4 co-localize with ERp44 or PDI by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1C). Although PDI is primarily localized in the ER, endogenous ERp44 recycles between the ER and cis Golgi and accumulates preferentially in the ERGIC (6.Gilchrist A. Au C.E. Hiding J. Bell A.W. Fernandez-Rodriguez J. Lesimple S. Nagaya H. Roy L. Gosline S.J. Hallett M. Paiement J. Kearney R.E. Nilsson T. Bergeron J.J.

Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1A, both Ero1α and Prx4 showed co-localization with PDI and ERp44 in HeLa cells (Fig. 1C). Co-localization was stronger with PDI, suggesting that Ero1α and Prx4 were mainly localized in the ER and to a lesser extent in the ERGIC. In many cells, co-staining with ERp44 and PDI was more evident for Prx4 than Ero1α (data not shown), which may reflect the localization of part of Ero1α in mitochondria-associated ER membranes (28.Anelli T. Bergamelli L. Margittai E. Rimessi A. Fagioli C. Malgaroli A. Pinton P. Ripamonti M. Rizzuto R. Sitia R.

Lynes E.M. Benson M.D. Watts R. Vance J.E. Simmen T. Ero1α requires oxidizing and normoxic conditions to localize to the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM).Cell Stress Chaperones. 2010; 15: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Confirming previous observations (30.Okado-Matsumoto A. Matsumoto A. Fujii J. Taniguchi N. Peroxiredoxin IV is a secretable protein with heparin-binding properties under reduced conditions.J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), overexpressed Prx4 was clearly secreted by HeLa cells (Fig. 2A, lane 2), implying that saturable mechanisms determine its intracellular retention. Co-expression of ERp44 or PDI, but not of ERp57, restored retention of overexpressed Prx4 (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–5). These secretory phenotypes were similar for Ero1α (Fig. 2B). In the experiment shown, ERp57 partly inhibited secretion of overexpressed Ero1α, albeit much less efficiently than ERp44 or PDI (Fig. 2B, lane 5) (20.Otsu M. Bertoli G. Fagioli C. Guerini-Rocco E. Nerini-Molteni S. Ruffato E. Sitia R. Dynamic retention of Ero1α and Ero1β in the endoplasmic reticulum by interactions with PDI and ERp44.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). ERp57 cooperates with calnexin and calreticulin to promote glycoprotein folding. The absence of glycosylation sites in Prx4 may explain why co-expressed ERp57 did not affect its secretion. Thus, ERp44 and PDI but not ERp57 can retain overexpressed Prx4. In thiol-dependent quality control, Cys-29 in the atypical redox-active motif of ERp44 forms mixed disulfides with Ero1 and client proteins such as IgM, adiponectin, or SUMF1/FGE (sulfatase-modifying factor 1/formylglycine-generating enzyme) (5.Cortini M. Sitia R. From antibodies to adiponectin: role of ERp44 in sizing and timing protein secretion.Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2010; 12: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Clearly, Prx4-FLAG secretion was decreased in a dose-dependent manner by wild type HA-ERp44 (WT) but not by a mutant in which Cys-29 was replaced by a serine (yielding ERp44 C29S, Fig. 2C). In contrast, a PDI mutant in which cysteine residues of the two CXXC motifs were replaced by alanine residues (PDI-AA) inhibited Prx4 secretion almost as efficiently as wild type molecules (Fig. 2D). Thus, the enzymatically active cysteine residues of PDI are not necessary for retention of Prx4. Because Prx4 shares similar retention mechanisms with Ero1α, the two proteins could compete with each other. Accordingly, secretion of Prx4-FLAG was dramatically increased by Ero1α-FLAG co-expression (Fig. 2E, compare lanes 2 and 4). Also an enzymatically inactive mutant of Ero1α (Ero1α-C94A) promoted Prx4 secretion (Fig. 2E, lane 5). Conversely, secretion of Ero1α-FLAG was not increased by co-expression of abundant Prx4-FLAG (Fig. 2F, lanes 2 and 4). The unidirectional competition between Ero1α and Prx4 suggested that the former binds to its retainers more efficiently than the latter. Therefore, we analyzed their binding properties in vitro by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays and estimated the kon, koff, and KD values. PDI bound Ero1α with ∼5.5-fold stronger affinity than Prx4 at pH 7.4, which is similar to the pH in the ER (1.94 and 10.6 μm, respectively, Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. 3). In contrast, the two enzymes displayed similar affinities for ERp44 at pH 6.4 (5.15 and 6.92 μm, for Ero1α and Prx4, respectively). The affinity of ERp44 to Ero1α and Prx4 was decreased at pH 7.4 in comparison with that at pH 6.4 (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. 3), suggesting that ERp44 binds Prx4 more effectively at low pH like in the distal ESC stations (10.4 and 17.9 μm for Ero1α and Prx4, respectively) (12.Vavassori S. Cortini M. Masui S. Sannino S. Anelli T. Caserta I.R. Fagioli C. Mossuto M.F. Fornili A. van Anken E. Degano M. Inaba K. Sitia R. A pH-regulated quality control cycle for surveillance of secretory protein assembly.Mol. Cell. 2013; 50: 783-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Extrapolating these in vitro results to the cellular environment, PDI would preferentially retain Ero1α in the ER. To challenge this possibility, we co-expressed increasing amounts of PDI-FLAG with constant levels of Ero1α-FLAG and Prx4-FLAG in HeLa cells. 24 h after transfection, culture media and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 3B) and quantified (Fig. 3D). Consistent with the in vitro results shown in Fig. 3A, Ero1α secretion was primarily inhibited by PDI, whereas higher levels of expression of PDI were required to retain Prx4 (Fig. 3, B and D). In contrast, HA-ERp44 inhibited secretion of Ero1α-FLAG and Prx4-FLAG to similar extents. Collectively, these results indicate that PDI binds and retains Ero1α more efficiently than Prx4. In view of their different distributions along ESC (7.Anelli T. Ceppi S. Bergamelli L. Cortini M. Masciarelli S. Valetti C. Sitia R.

https://openalex.org/W2032275436,"Direct cellular entry of potentially useful polar compounds into cells is prevented by the hydrophobic barrier of the membrane. Toward circumventing this barrier, we used high throughput screening to identify a family of peptides that carry membrane-impermeant cargos across synthetic membranes. Here we characterize the plasma membrane translocation of these peptides with polar cargos under a variety of conditions. The spontaneous membrane-translocating peptides (SMTPs) delivered the zwitterionic, membrane-impermeant dye tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) into cells even when the conditions were not permissive for endocytosis. They also delivered the larger, anionic membrane-impermeant dye Alexa Fluor 546 but did not deliver a quantum dot nanoparticle. Under all conditions, the SMTP-cargo filled the cytoplasm with a diffuse, non-punctate fluorescence that was partially excluded from the nucleus. D-amino acid peptides behaved identically in vitro, ruling out proteolysis as an important factor in the diffuse cellular distribution. Thus, cytosolic delivery of SMTP-cargo conjugates is dominated by direct membrane translocation. This is in sharp contrast to Arg9-TAMRA, a representative highly cationic, cell-penetrating peptide, which entered cells only when endocytosis was permitted. Arg9-TAMRA triggered large scale endocytosis and did not appreciably escape the endosomal compartments in the 1-h timescales we studied. When injected into mice, SMTP-TAMRA conjugates were found in many tissues even after 2 h. Unconjugated TAMRA was rapidly cleared and did not become systemically distributed. SMTPs are a platform that could improve delivery of many polar compounds to cells, in the laboratory or in the clinic, including those that would otherwise be rejected as drugs because they are membrane-impermeant."
https://openalex.org/W1993239840,"Thickening of the vessel in response to high low density lipoprotein(s) (LDL) levels is a hallmark of atherosclerosis, characterized by increased hyaluronan (HA) deposition in the neointima. Human native LDL trapped within the arterial wall undergoes modifications such as oxidation (oxLDL). The aim of our study is to elucidate the link between internalization of oxLDL and HA production in vitro, using human aortic smooth muscle cells. LDL were used at an effective protein concentration of 20–50 μg/ml, which allowed 80% cell viability. HA content in the medium of untreated cells was 28.9 ± 3.7 nmol HA-disaccharide/cell and increased after oxLDL treatment to 53.9 ± 5.6. OxLDL treatments doubled the transcripts of HA synthase HAS2 and HAS3. Accumulated HA stimulated migration of aortic smooth muscle cells and monocyte adhesiveness to extracellular matrix. The effects induced by oxLDL were inhibited by blocking LOX-1 scavenger receptor with a specific antibody (10 μg/ml). The cholesterol moiety of LDL has an important role in HA accumulation because cholesterol-free oxLDL failed to induce HA synthesis. Nevertheless, cholesterol-free oxLDL and unmodified cholesterol (20 μg/ml) induce only HAS3 transcription, whereas 22,oxysterol affects both HAS2 and HAS3. Moreover, HA deposition was associated with higher expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers (CHOP and GRP78). Our data suggest that HA synthesis can be induced in response to specific oxidized sterol-related species delivered through oxLDL.Background: OxLDL and the high level of hyaluronan are major triggering factors of atherosclerosis.Results: The oxLDL load of the aortic human smooth muscle cells (SMC) via the scavenger receptor LOX-1 causes ER stress, overexpression of HAS2, and hyaluronan deposition.Conclusion: the oxidized sterols driven into the SMC by oxLDL have a role in hyaluronan metabolism.Significance: oxLDL influences extracellular matrix hyaluronan. Thickening of the vessel in response to high low density lipoprotein(s) (LDL) levels is a hallmark of atherosclerosis, characterized by increased hyaluronan (HA) deposition in the neointima. Human native LDL trapped within the arterial wall undergoes modifications such as oxidation (oxLDL). The aim of our study is to elucidate the link between internalization of oxLDL and HA production in vitro, using human aortic smooth muscle cells. LDL were used at an effective protein concentration of 20–50 μg/ml, which allowed 80% cell viability. HA content in the medium of untreated cells was 28.9 ± 3.7 nmol HA-disaccharide/cell and increased after oxLDL treatment to 53.9 ± 5.6. OxLDL treatments doubled the transcripts of HA synthase HAS2 and HAS3. Accumulated HA stimulated migration of aortic smooth muscle cells and monocyte adhesiveness to extracellular matrix. The effects induced by oxLDL were inhibited by blocking LOX-1 scavenger receptor with a specific antibody (10 μg/ml). The cholesterol moiety of LDL has an important role in HA accumulation because cholesterol-free oxLDL failed to induce HA synthesis. Nevertheless, cholesterol-free oxLDL and unmodified cholesterol (20 μg/ml) induce only HAS3 transcription, whereas 22,oxysterol affects both HAS2 and HAS3. Moreover, HA deposition was associated with higher expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers (CHOP and GRP78). Our data suggest that HA synthesis can be induced in response to specific oxidized sterol-related species delivered through oxLDL. Background: OxLDL and the high level of hyaluronan are major triggering factors of atherosclerosis. Results: The oxLDL load of the aortic human smooth muscle cells (SMC) via the scavenger receptor LOX-1 causes ER stress, overexpression of HAS2, and hyaluronan deposition. Conclusion: the oxidized sterols driven into the SMC by oxLDL have a role in hyaluronan metabolism. Significance: oxLDL influences extracellular matrix hyaluronan. Atherosclerosis, usually classified as a chronic inflammatory disease of the blood vessel wall, is the most common cause of cardiovascular diseases. The localized inflammation causes the thickening of the arterial wall due to the increased deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). 3The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; HA, hyaluronan; HAS, hyaluronan synthase; LOX-1, lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1; SR-PSOX, scavenger receptor for phosphatidylserine and oxidized lipoprotein; SR-AI, scavenger receptor AI; CD36, class B scavenger receptor; CD, (2-hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin; CF, cholesterol-free; CHOP, C/EBP homologous protein; C/EBP, CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein; GRP78, glucose-regulated protein 78; SREBP, sterol regulatory element binding protein; aggLDL, aggregated LDL; nLDL, native LDL; oxLDL, oxidized LDL; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SMC, smooth muscle cells; AoSMC, aortic smooth muscle cells; LXR, liver X receptors; RXR, retinoid X receptors; DiI, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; CNT, control. The newly formed ECM traps lipoprotein and inflammatory/growth factors from the circulation within the vessel wall (1.Vijayagopal P. Figueroa J.E. Fontenot J.D. Glancy D.L.

The atheromatous plaque is therefore formed by a central core of cholesterol crystals and foam cells encircled by altered ECM. Despite the many cardiovascular risk factors reported in published guidelines and reduction strategies, recent studies underscored again the relevance of plasma lipoproteins (LDL) in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (2.Badimon L. Vilahur G. LDL-cholesterol versus HDL-cholesterol in the atherosclerotic plaque: inflammatory resolution versus thrombotic chaos.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2012; 1254: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In particular, the ratio of the protein moieties of the lipoproteins ApoB/ApoA1 (reflecting LDL/HDL amounts) and the quantification of the circulating LDL-cholesterol are at the moment the routine risk factors evaluated in the daily clinical practice. The chronic and repeated exposure to pathogenic risk factors triggers a complex interplay between circulating species, such as monocytes and lymphocytes, and various cell types, resident within the arterial wall, including endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (SMC). In the healthy arterial vessel wall, endothelial cells regulate the vascular tone, the thrombosis/fibrinolysis balance, and the recruitment of inflammatory cells; most of these abilities are due to ECM that is enriched with hyaluronan (HA), which forms the glycocalyx. Although the HA within the arterial wall is present in physiological conditions predominantly in the tunica adventitia produced by vascular SMC, during the atherosclerotic process HA, is highly synthesized and also deposited in the neointima (3.Nagy N.

HA is a nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan that is present in ECMs as a polyanionic chain of up to 107 Da. Several cell types, including aortic SMC (AoSMC), produce HA either in physiological or in pathological conditions. HA is the only glycosaminoglycan synthesized at the plasma membrane (6.Vigetti D.

The HA synthases (HASs) are a family of three members (HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3), each one characterized by expression timelines and regulation at transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional levels (7.Vigetti D.

HA, both secreted and pericellular, is known to have a pivotal role in cell migration, proliferation, and leukocyte adhesion in the atherosclerotic plaques (9.Toole B.P. Wight T.N. Tammi M.I.

OxLDL, in addition to the proper oxidized lipid products, also contains lysophospholipids, hydrolytic derivatives of oxidized phospholipids, prostanoids, isoprostanoids, leukotrienes, which are derived from the oxidation of arachidonic acid (17.Leonarduzzi G. Gamba P. Gargiulo S. Biasi F. Poli G. Inflammation-related gene expression by lipid oxidation-derived products in the progression of atherosclerosis.Free Radic. Biol.

Biol. 2006; 26: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although the majority of SMC in the arterial wall are contained within the medial layer, a significant number exist within the intima as well. Those SMC retain a certain degree of plasticity, altering their expression of cell-specific genes in response to many stimuli, i.e. switching from the “contractile” to the “synthetic” phenotypic state. This phenotypic switch can be triggered by several atherogenic stimuli, such as ECM composition, cytokines, shear stress, reactive oxygen species, and lipids, and is associated with different behaviors of SMC (20.Doran A.C. Meller N. McNamara C.A. Role of smooth muscle cells in the initiation and early progression of atherosclerosis.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 812-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Moreover, those SMC can also give rise to a significant number of lipid-laden cells, although the larger portion of the foam cells derives from macrophages (20.Doran A.C. Meller N. McNamara C.A.

Redox Signal. 2011; 15: 2301-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and can enhance atherosclerosis progression. In this study, we used a cellular model to investigate the correlation between the exposure of AoSMC to oxLDL and the accumulation of HA. In particular, we analyzed at the molecular level the mechanisms that induced AoSMC to produce an HA-enriched ECM, the role of the oxLDL in delivering molecules that can trigger the phenotypic switch, and the eventual contribution of cholesterol to this early atherogenic event. Human AoSMC were purchased from Lonza and grown in the complete SmGm2 culture medium (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 5% FBS as described previously (25.Vigetti D. Rizzi M. Viola M. Karousou E. Genasetti A. Clerici M. Bartolini B. Hascall V.C. De Luca G. Passi A. The effects of 4-methylumbelliferone on hyaluronan synthesis, MMP2 activity, proliferation, and motility of human aortic smooth muscle cells.Glycobiology. 2009; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 1.5 × 105 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at 70–80% confluence. They were incubated for 48 h in DMEM with 0.2% FBS medium and afterward supplemented with SmGm2, 5% FBS and incubated for a further 48 h with different concentrations of native, oxidized, and aggregated LDL (nLDL, oxLDL, and aggLDL, respectively). Cell viability was evaluated with trypan blue staining. Monocyte U937 cells were grown in suspension culture in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and routinely cultured at 1–10 × 105 cells/ml. Native LDL (nLDL, d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) were purified from plasma of normocholesterolemic volunteers kindly provided by the “Ospedale di Circolo” following the method described in Ref. 26.Albertini R. Ramos P. Giessauf A. Passi A. De Luca G. Esterbauer H. Chondroitin 4-sulphate exhibits inhibitory effect during Cu2+-mediated LDL oxidation.FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar. OxLDL were obtained by incubation of 100 μg/ml nLDL with 5 μm CuSO4 at 37 °C for 16–18 h, and the reaction was then stopped with EDTA 1 mm. The oxLDL were desalted by filtration in PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare) and concentrated with Centriprep concentrators (10 kDa NMWL, nominal molecular weight limit) (Amicon). AggLDLs were obtained by vortexing nLDL for 5 min at room temperature (15.Llorente-Cortés V. Martínez-González J. Badimon L. LDL receptor-related protein mediates uptake of aggregated LDL in human vascular smooth muscle cells.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1572-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The nLDLs were treated overnight with 5 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma) (27.Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Use of cyclodextrins for manipulating cellular cholesterol content.J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 37 °C with gentle mixing, and excess of methyl-β-cyclodextrin was eliminated by filtration on PD-10 columns to obtain the cholesterol-free form of LDL (CF-nLDL). CF-nLDLs were then subjected to oxidation as described above, and oxidized cholesterol-free LDLs (CF-oxLDLs) were obtained. All LDL preparations were sterilized by filtration through 0.2-μm filters. Protein contents were determined by the Bradford assay, and total cholesterol was quantified by a colorimetric enzymatic assay (Olympus Cholesterol OSR6516). The purity of LDL preparations was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Briefly, 50 μg of total proteins were added with the same volume of Sudan black (Sigma) 2 mg/ml in ethanol, 2% glycerol, incubated at room temperature in the dark for 1 h, loaded in a 0.5% agarose gel in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris, 20 mm acetic acid, 1 mm EDTA), and run with 0.05 m thiobarbituric acid buffer pH 8.5, 100 V for 30 min. Anti-scavenger receptor LOX-1 antibody was added at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Cholesterol was delivered to AoSMC in a complex with (2-hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin solution (CD) (Sigma), a cyclic oligosaccharide that solubilizes cholesterol and can be used as a “carrier” molecule. The mixture was prepared as described previously (27.Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Use of cyclodextrins for manipulating cellular cholesterol content.J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a final concentration of 10 μg/ml cholesterol. When CD-cholesterol complex was added to cell culture, the final CD concentration was 2.5 mm, which was therefore added to AoSMC as a further control. (22)(R)-Hydrocholesterol (Sigma) was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 7.5 μm for 48 h. nLDL and oxLDL were labeled with DiI (1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate, Molecular Probes) following the procedure described previously (28.Reynolds G.D. St Clair R.W.

Pathol. 1985; 121: 200-211PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, LDL preparations at 1 mg/ml were incubated with DiI 3 mg/ml in DMSO overnight at 37 °C, recovered by ultracentrifugation, and concentrated. Images of AoSMC after a 24-h treatment with 20 μg/ml nLDL-DiI or oxLDL-DiI, in the absence or presence of anti-LOX-1 antibody (10 μg/ml), were captured using fluorescence microscopy (Olympus), and the cell fluorescence was quantified using the ImageJ software (58.Burgess A.

Total RNA was extracted from AoSMC cultures with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy), digested with Turbo DNase (Ambion, Monza, Italy), retrotranscribed by the High Capacity cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems, Monza, Italy), and amplified on an ABI Prism 7000 instrument (Applied Biosystems) using the TaqMan universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's instructions. The following human TaqMan gene expression assays were used: HAS1 (Hs00155410), HAS2 (Hs00193435_m1), HAS3 (Hs00193436_m1), CHOP (Hs01090850_m1), GRP78 (Hs00946084_g1), and the housekeeping gene β-actin (Hs99999903_m1). The relative quantification of gene expression was determined by comparing 2−ΔΔCt (29.Vigetti D. Moretto P. Viola M. Genasetti A. Rizzi M. Karousou E. Pallotti F. De Luca G. Passi A.

For semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses of LDL scavenger receptors, cDNAs were amplified using the following primers: LOX-1 (forward, 5′-GCCATTCCGAAATCAAGAAA-3′ and reverse, 5′-AGGAGTCATCAGGAGGAGCA-3′, SR-PSOX (forward, 5′-TACACGAGGTTCCAGCTCCT-3′ and reverse, 5′-TACCATGTTGTCAGGGGTCA-3′), SR-AI (forward, 5′-GGAACACATGAGCAACATGG-3′ and reverse, 5′-CCAAGCTCCTACAGACGACC-3′), CD36 (forward, 5′-GGCTGAGCAAGGTTGACTTC-3′ and reverse, 5′-CCTCCTTATCCTTTGAGCCC-3′), LRP1 (forward, 5′-ACCACCAGCTACCTCATTGG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TTGTTCTCGCACTTGAATCG-3′), and housekeeping β-actin (forward, 5′-CTCTTCCAGCCTTCCTTCCT-3′ and reverse, 5′-ATGCTATCACCTCCCCTGTG-3′). Amplifications of cDNA were done using the first strand cDNA synthesis mixture, 0.1 μm forward and reverse primers, 200 μm dNTPs, and RedTaq polymerase (Sigma) in its own buffer. Reaction mixtures were subjected to 35 cycles with the following parameters: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 52 °C for 40 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min. HA released into the medium was quantified by HPLC analysis as described previously (30.Karousou E.G. Militsopoulou M. Porta G. De Luca G. Hascall V.C. Passi A.

Wound area was measured at time 0 (t0) and after 24 h (t24), and the wound closure was determined by the equation: ((wound area t0 − wound area t24)/wound area t0)×100. AoSMC cultures were treated with 4-methylumbelliferone in DMSO at a final concentration of 1 mm (25.Vigetti D. Rizzi M. Viola M. Karousou E. Genasetti A. Clerici M. Bartolini B. Hascall V.C.

Briefly, U937 were labeled with fluorescent green CytoTracker (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) vital stain and plated on AoSMC incubated with oxLDL. As control, AoSMC were pretreated with 2 units/μl Streptomyces hyaluronidase (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan). After PBS washing, the adherent cells were quantified under a fluorescent microscope (Olympus, Segrate, Italy). GraphPad Prism version 5.01 for Windows and GraphPad Software were used for statistical analysis. The number of independent replicate experiments is indicated in each figure legend. Data are presented as means of independent experiments ± S.E. Statistical significance was tested with analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test, or in Fig. 5B, by unpaired Student's t test. Statistically significant values of p are reported in the figure legends. To investigate how LDL particles may affect glycosaminoglycans secreted by AoSMC and contribute to the onset of atherosclerosis, we subjected AoSMC to 48 h of treatment with different LDLs. Increasing amounts of nLDL, oxLDL, and aggLDL were added to cultured cells, and the cell viability was evaluated after 48 h (Fig. 1A). Nontoxic concentrations spanned the range of 10–50 μg of LDL proteins/ml for all the preparations, with an average of more than 80% of total vital cells after the exposure. At higher concentrations, oxLDL and aggLDL were toxic to AoSMC, with the highest effect obtained with oxLDL. Treatment with 20–50 μg/ml of either nLDL or aggLDL did not modify HA secretion into the culture medium beyond control level (Fig. 1B). In contrast, oxLDLs at these concentrations significantly increased HA secretion, from 28.9 ± 3.7 nmol Δ-HA/cell of the control to 53.9 ± 5.6 and 61.0 ± 2.8 nmol Δ-HA/cell in 20 and 50 μg/ml oxLDL treatments, respectively (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the 20–50 μg/ml concentrations of oxLDL were able to produce a similar effect on HA secretion. Because aggLDL did not influence the levels of either HA or CS (data not shown), they were not tested further. AoSMC pericellular coat was also increased after 48 h of treatment with oxLDL as compared with control and nLDL-treated cultures (Fig. 1C). The increase was mainly constituted by HA because hyaluronidase digestion restored the sizes to control levels as shown by quantification after particle exclusion assays (Fig. 1C). Again, the coating sizes at the two concentrations of oxLDL were nearly the same. Therefore, in the following experiments, only the lowest active amount (20 μg/ml) was used. Because AoSMC can express three hyaluronan synthases (32.Vigetti D. Viola M. Karousou E. Rizzi M. Moretto P. Genasetti A. Clerici M. Hascall V.C. De Luca G. Passi A.

https://openalex.org/W2031747077,"Human deoxycytidine deaminase APOBEC3A (Apo3A) acts as an HIV-1 restriction factor in cells of myeloid lineage yet functions separately as a potent mutator for genomic DNA. Apo3A activity and C motif deamination specificity exhibit a striking dependence on pH that reflects these two distinct biological processes. Upon infection of macrophages, HIV-1 induces the formation of autophagosomes, and requires autophagosomes for replication, whereas inhibiting lysosomal fusion indicative of late stage autophagy. Here we show that Apo3A has optimal activity and a strict 5'-YYCR motif specificity in the pH 5.8-6.1 range, characteristic of enclosed autophagosomal membrane compartments, and reflective of the mutation pattern of HIV-1. In contrast to the high activity and narrow specificity of Apo3A at acid pH, a 13-30-fold reduction in specific activity is accompanied by relaxed C deamination specificity at pH 7.4-8. Notably, Apo3A is also expressed in keratinocytes, and is up-regulated in skin lesions. At pH 7.9, we show that Apo3A generates transcription-dependent CC → TT tandem mutations on the non-transcribed strand, a hallmark signature of skin cancer. The biochemical data taken in conjunction with the biological up-regulation of Apo3A in skin lesions suggests that enzyme-catalyzed deaminations at adjacent C sites followed by normal replication generating CC → TT mutations provides an alternative molecular basis for the initiation events in skin cancer in contrast to well established pathways in which CC dimers formed in response to UV radiation either undergo nonenzymatic spontaneous deaminations or aberrant replication."
https://openalex.org/W2061563507,"Myosin Va (myoVa) is a molecular motor that processively transports cargo along actin tracks. One well studied cargo in vivo is the melanosome, a pigment organelle that is moved first by kinesin on microtubules and then handed off to myoVa for transport in the actin-rich dendritic periphery of melanocytes. Melanophilin (Mlph) is the adapter protein that links Rab27a-melanosomes to myoVa. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and quantum dot-labeled full-length myoVa, we show at the single-molecule level that Mlph increases the number of processively moving myoVa motors by 17-fold. Surprisingly, myoVa-Mlph moves ∼4-fold slower than myoVa alone and with twice the run length. These two changes greatly increase the time spent on actin, a property likely to enhance the transfer of melanosomes to the adjacent keratinocyte. In contrast to the variable stepping pattern of full-length myoVa, the myoVa-Mlph complex shows a normal gating pattern between the heads typical of a fully active motor and consistent with a cargo-dependent activation mechanism. The Mlph-dependent changes in myoVa depend on a positively charged cluster of amino acids in the actin binding domain of Mlph, suggesting that Mlph acts as a “tether” that links the motor to the track.

We generated mice with thyrocyte-selective ablation of IGF-1 receptor (TIGF1RKO) to explore the role of IGF-1 receptor signaling on thyroid function and growth. In 5-wk-old TIGF1RKO mice, serum thyroxine (T4) concentrations were decreased by 30% in concert with a 43% down-regulation of the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), which is involved in T4 secretion. Despite a 3.5-fold increase in circulating concentrations of TSH, thyroid architecture and size were normal. Furthermore, thyrocyte area was increased by 40% in WT thyroids after 10 d TSH injection, but this effect was absent in TSH-injected TIGF1RKO mice. WT mice treated with methimazole and sodium perchlorate for 2 or 6 wk exhibited pronounced goiter development (2.0 and 5.4-fold, respectively), but in TIGF1RKO mice, goiter development was completely abrogated.

https://openalex.org/W2080405368,"CLC anion transporters form dimers that function either as Cl(-) channels or as electrogenic Cl(-)/H(+) exchangers. CLC channels display two different types of ""gates,"" ""protopore"" gates that open and close the two pores of a CLC dimer independently of each other and common gates that act on both pores simultaneously. ClC-7/Ostm1 is a lysosomal 2Cl(-)/1H(+) exchanger that is slowly activated by depolarization. This gating process is drastically accelerated by many CLCN7 mutations underlying human osteopetrosis. Making use of some of these mutants, we now investigate whether slow voltage activation of plasma membrane-targeted ClC-7/Ostm1 involves protopore or common gates. Voltage activation of wild-type ClC-7 subunits was accelerated by co-expressing an excess of ClC-7 subunits carrying an accelerating mutation together with a point mutation rendering these subunits transport-deficient. Conversely, voltage activation of a fast ClC-7 mutant could be slowed by co-expressing an excess of a transport-deficient mutant. These effects did not depend on whether the accelerating mutation localized to the transmembrane part or to cytoplasmic cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domains of ClC-7. Combining accelerating mutations in the same subunit did not speed up gating further. No currents were observed when ClC-7 was truncated after the last intramembrane helix. Currents and slow gating were restored when the C terminus was co-expressed by itself or fused to the C terminus of the β-subunit Ostm1. We conclude that common gating underlies the slow voltage activation of ClC-7. It depends on the CBS domain-containing C terminus that does not require covalent binding to the membrane domain of ClC-7."
https://openalex.org/W2076088245,"A nonsense mutation in cereblon (CRBN) causes autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation. Cereblon is a substrate receptor for the Cullin-RING E3 ligase complex and couples the ubiquitin ligase to specific ubiquitination targets. The CRBN nonsense mutation (R419X) results in a protein lacking 24 amino acids at its C terminus. Although this mutation has been linked to mild mental retardation, the mechanism by which the mutation affects CRBN function is unknown. Here, we used biochemical and mass spectrometric approaches to explore the function of this mutant. We show that the protein retains its ability to assemble into a Cullin-RING E3 ligase complex and catalyzes the ubiquitination of CRBN-target proteins. However, we find that this mutant exhibits markedly increased levels of autoubiquitination and is more readily degraded by the proteasome than the wild type protein. We also show that the level of the mutant protein can be restored by a treatment of cells with a clinically utilized proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that this agent may be useful for the treatment of mental retardation associated with the CRBN R419X mutation. These data demonstrate that enhanced autoubiquitination and degradation account for the defect in CRBN activity that leads to mental retardation."
https://openalex.org/W2045931629,"A more thorough understanding of the differences in DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles in populations may hold promise for identifying molecular mechanisms through which genetic and environmental factors jointly contribute to human diseases. Inflammation is a key molecular mechanism underlying several chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, and it affects DNAm profile on both global and locus-specific levels. To understand the impact of inflammation on the DNAm of the human genome, we investigated DNAm profiles of peripheral blood leukocytes from 966 African American participants in the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) study. By testing the association of DNAm sites on CpG islands of over 14,000 genes with C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory biomarker of cardiovascular disease, we identified 257 DNAm sites in 240 genes significantly associated with serum levels of CRP adjusted for age, sex, body mass index and smoking status, and corrected for multiple testing. Of the significantly associated DNAm sites, 80.5% were hypomethylated with higher CRP levels. The most significant Gene Ontology terms enriched in the genes associated with the CRP levels were immune system process, immune response, defense response, response to stimulus, and response to stress, which are all linked to the functions of leukocytes. While the CRP-associated DNAm may be cell-type specific, understanding the DNAm association with CRP in peripheral blood leukocytes of multi-ethnic populations can assist in unveiling the molecular mechanism of how the process of inflammation affects the risks of developing common disease through epigenetic modifications."

In SDH5 knock-out mice, lung epithelial cells exhibited elevated mesenchymal markers, which is characteristic of EMT. Using a human lung xenograft-mouse model, we observed that knocking down endogenous SDH5 in human carcinoma cells leads to the development of multiple lymph node metastases. Moreover, our data indicate that SDH5 functions as a critical protein in regulating EMT by modulating the glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β-β-catenin signaling pathway. These results reveal a critical role for SDH5 in EMT and suggest that SDH5 may be a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for lung cancer metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W1964834181,"Global downregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is a common feature of human tumors and has been shown to enhance cancer progression. Several components of the miRNA biogenesis machinery (XPO5, DICER and TRBP) have been shown to act as haploinsufficient tumor suppressors. How the deregulation of miRNA biogenesis promotes tumor development is not clearly understood. Here we show that loss of miRNA biogenesis increased resistance to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced cell death. We observed that HCT116 cells with a DICER hypomorphic mutation (Exn5/Exn5) or where DICER or DROSHA were knocked down were resistant to ER stress-induced cell death. Extensive analysis revealed little difference in the unfolded protein response (UPR) of WT compared to Exn5/Exn5 HCT116 cells upon ER stress treatment. However, analysis of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway showed that resistance occurred upstream of the mitochondria. In particular, BAX activation and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential was attenuated, and there was altered expression of BCL-2 family proteins. These observations demonstrate a key role for miRNAs as critical modulators of the ER stress response. In our model, downregulation of miRNA biogenesis delays ER stress-induced apoptosis. This suggests that disrupted miRNA biogenesis may contribute to cancer progression by inhibiting ER stress-induced cell death."

The TREX1 protein is composed of 314 amino acids; the N-terminal 242 amino acids contain the catalytic domain, and the C-terminal region (CTR) localizes TREX1 to the cytosolic compartment. In this study, we show that TREX1 modification by ubiquitination is controlled by a highly conserved sequence in the CTR to affect cellular localization. Transfection of TREX1 deletion constructs into human cells demonstrated that this sequence is required for ubiquitination at multiple lysine residues through a “non-canonical” ubiquitin linkage. A proteomic approach identified ubiquilin 1 as a TREX1 CTR-interacting protein, and this interaction was verified in vitro and in vivo. Cotransfection studies indicated that ubiquilin 1 localizes TREX1 to cytosolic punctate structures dependent upon the TREX1 CTR and lysines within the TREX1 catalytic core.

The varied effects exhibited by TREX1 mutant alleles on catalytic function and cellular localization, coupled with the varied levels of disease pathogenesis in humans, highlight the complex biology of TREX1 in DNA degradation and immune activation.

A series of TREX1 deletion constructs was generated to show that the CTR is necessary for covalent modification by ubiquitination in human cells. A mutagenesis strategy was used to determine a “non-canonical” ubiquitin linkage at multiple TREX1 lysine residues, suggesting that this modification might regulate cellular function. A proteomic approach identified ubiquilin 1 interaction with the TREX1 CTR, facilitating the translocation of ubiquitinated TREX1 from the perinuclear region to cytosolic puncta in human cells. We show that a subset of AGS-causing TREX1 mutants located in the catalytic core and in the CTR exhibit full catalytic activity, are differentially ubiquitinated compared with WT TREX1, and exhibit altered translocation and co-localization with ubiquilin 1. These data indicate that the TREX1 CTR controls cellular trafficking of this exonuclease by ubiquitination and interaction with ubiquilin 1, providing a novel mechanism through which TREX1 mutations disrupt nucleic acid processing and aberrant immune activation.

https://openalex.org/W2143868008,"Mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic damage are important features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) associated with amyloid β (Aβ) and tau. We reported previously that the scaffolding protein RanBP9, which is overall increased in brains of patients with AD and in mutant APP transgenic mice, simultaneously promotes Aβ generation and focal adhesion disruption by accelerating the endocytosis of APP and β1-integrin, respectively. Moreover, RanBP9 induces neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo and mediates Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. Here we show in primary hippocampal neurons that RanBP9 potentiates Aβ-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, apoptosis, and calcium deregulation. Analyses of calcium-handling measures demonstrate that RanBP9 selectively delays the clearance of cytosolic Ca2+ mediated by the mitochondrial calcium uniporter through a process involving the translocation of cofilin into mitochondria and oxidative mechanisms. Further, RanBP9 retards the anterograde axonal transport of mitochondria in primary neurons and decreases synaptic mitochondrial activity in brain. These data indicate that RanBP9, cofilin, and Aβ mimic and potentiate each other to produce mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS overproduction, and calcium deregulation, which leads to neurodegenerative changes reminiscent of those seen in AD.—Roh.

https://openalex.org/W2005614916,"Background The partner and localizer of breast cancer 2 (PALB2) is responsible for facilitating BRCA2-mediated DNA repair by serving as a bridging molecule, acting as the physical and functional link between the breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer 2 (BRCA2) proteins. Truncating mutations in the PALB2 gene are rare but are thought to be associated with increased risks of developing breast cancer in various populations. Methods We evaluated the contribution of PALB2 germline mutations in 122 Asian women with breast cancer, all of whom had significant family history of breast and other cancers. Further screening for nine PALB2 mutations was conducted in 874 Malaysian and 532 Singaporean breast cancer patients, and in 1342 unaffected Malaysian and 541 unaffected Singaporean women. Results By analyzing the entire coding region of PALB2, we found two novel truncating mutations and ten missense mutations in families tested negative for BRCA1/2-mutations. One additional novel truncating PALB2 mutation was identified in one patient through genotyping analysis. Our results indicate a low prevalence of deleterious PALB2 mutations and a specific mutation profile within the Malaysian and Singaporean populations."

In this study, we aimed to identify prognostic biomarkers in GIST. We assessed the prognostic value of E twenty-six variant 1 (ETV1), a recently identified transcription factor unique to GIST. We also examined the clinical utility and functions of its downstream gene, potassium channel tetramerization domain containing protein 10 (KCTD10).The levels of ETV1 and KCTD10 were evaluated immunohistochemically in 112 patients with GIST treated at two hospitals. The functional properties of KCTD10 were examined by gene silencing assay in cultured GIST cells.Immunohistochemistry revealed that ETV1 expression in GIST had no prognostic significance. In contrast, the disease-free survival rate was 88.5% in patients with KCTD10-positive tumors and 55.8% in those with KCTD10-negative tumors (p <0.0001). KCTD10 was an independent prognostic factor (p <0.05). In the low-risk classification group, KCTD10 was significantly associated with favorable prognosis (p = 0.0008). Gene silencing of KCTD10 increased cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting that KCTD10 has a tumor-suppressive function.The GIST-specific transcription factor ETV1 may have no prognostic potential, whereas its downstream gene KCTD10 is associated with a favorable prognosis. Our study indicated the novel prognostic utility of KCTD10 in GIST, and suggested its tumor-suppressive effects on GIST cells. Further validation studies of KCTD10 for clinical applications, and functional verification of KCTD10 for better understanding of molecular basis of malignant phenotypes are worth challenging in GIST."

https://openalex.org/W2171464702,"Variation in the melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc1r) is associated with pigmentation diversity in wild and domesticated populations of vertebrates, including several species of birds. Among domestic bird species, pigmentation variation in the rock pigeon (Columbalivia) is particularly diverse. To determine the potential contribution of Mc1r variants to pigment diversity in pigeons, we sequenced Mc1r in a wide range of pigeon breeds and identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms, including a variant that codes for an amino acid substitution (Val85Met). In contrast to the association between Val85Met and eumelanism in other avian species, this change was associated with pheomelanism in pigeons. In vitro cAMP accumulation and protein expression assays revealed that Val85Met leads to decreased receptor function and reduced cell surface expression of the mutant protein. The reduced in vitro function is consistent with the observed association with reduced eumelanic pigmentation. Comparative genetic and cellular studies provide important insights about the range of mechanisms underlying diversity among vertebrates, including different phenotypic associations with similar mutations in different species."
https://openalex.org/W2118064809,"This study aimed to investigate whether the growth hormone release and metabolic effects of ghrelin on AMPK activity of peripheral tissues are mediated by cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) and the central nervous system. CB1-knockout (KO) and/or wild-type mice were injected peripherally or intracerebroventricularly with ghrelin and CB1 antagonist rimonabant to study tissue AMPK activity and gene expression (transcription factors SREBP1c, transmembrane protein FAS, enzyme PEPCK, and protein HSL). Growth hormone levels were studied both in vivo and in vitro. Peripherally administered ghrelin in liver, heart, and adipose tissue AMPK activity cannot be observed in CB1-KO or CB1 antagonist-treated mice. Intracerebroventricular ghrelin treatment can influence peripheral AMPK activity. This effect is abolished in CB1-KO mice and by intracerebroventricular rimonabant treatment, suggesting that central CB1 receptors also participate in the signaling pathway that mediates the effects of ghrelin on peripheral tissues. Interestingly, in vivo or in vitro growth hormone release is intact in response to ghrelin in CB1-KO animals. Our data suggest that the metabolic effects of ghrelin on AMPK in peripheral tissues are abolished by the lack of functional CB1 receptor via direct peripheral effect and partially through the central nervous system, thus supporting the existence of a possible ghrelin-cannabinoid–CB1–AMPK pathway.—Kola, B., Wittman, G., Bodnár, I., Amin, F., Lim, C.

https://openalex.org/W2050828394,"A constant supply of epithelial cells from dental epithelial stem cell (DESC) niches in the cervical loop (CL) enables mouse incisors to grow continuously throughout life. Elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this unlimited growth potential is of broad interest for tooth regenerative therapies. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling is essential for the development of mouse incisors and for maintenance of the CL during prenatal development. However, how FGF signaling in DESCs controls the self-renewal and differentiation of the cells is not well understood. Herein, we report that FGF signaling is essential for self-renewal and the prevention of cell differentiation of DESCs in the CL as well as in DESC spheres. Inhibiting the FGF signaling pathway decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of the cells in DESC spheres. Suppressing FGFR or its downstream signal transduction pathways diminished Lgr5-expressing cells in the CL and promoted cell differentiation both in DESC spheres and the CL. Furthermore, disruption of the FGF pathway abrogated Wnt signaling to promote Lgr5 expression in DESCs both in vitro and in vivo. This study sheds new light on understanding the mechanism by which the homeostasis, expansion, and differentiation of DESCs are regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2071290404,"Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) has previously been shown to ameliorate the cholesterol transport defect in Niemann Pick Type C1 (NPC1) cells, presumably by increasing the soluble levels of one of its substrates, vimentin. This activity would then restore the vimentin cycle in these cells and allow vimentin-dependent retrograde transport to proceed. Here, we further investigate the effects of PKC activation in NPC1 cells by evaluating different isoforms for their ability to solubilize vimentin and correct the NPC1 cholesterol storage phenotype. We also examine the effects of PKC activators, including free fatty acids and the PKC-specific activator diazoxide, on the NPC1 disease phenotype. Our results indicate that PKC isoforms α, βII, and ε have the greatest effects on vimentin solubilization. Furthermore, expression or activation of PKCε in NPC1 cells dramatically reduces the amount of stored cholesterol and restores cholesterol transport out of endocytic vesicles. These results provide further support for the contribution of PKCs in NPC1 disease pathogenesis and suggest that PKCs may be targeted in future efforts to develop therapeutics for NPC1 disease."
https://openalex.org/W2077634374,"Pulmonary surfactant is a lipid-protein complex that lowers surface tension at the respiratory air-liquid interface, stabilizing the lungs against physical forces tending to collapse alveoli. Dysfunction of surfactant is associated with respiratory pathologies such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or meconium aspiration syndrome where naturally occurring surfactant-inhibitory agents such as serum, meconium, or cholesterol reach the lung. We analyzed the effect of hyaluronan (HA) on the structure and surface behavior of pulmonary surfactant to understand the mechanism for HA-promoted surfactant protection in the presence of inhibitory agents. In particular, we found that HA affects structural properties such as the aggregation state of surfactant membranes and the size, distribution, and order/packing of phase-segregated lipid domains. These effects do not require a direct interaction between surfactant complexes and HA and are accompanied by a compositional reorganization of large surfactant complexes that become enriched with saturated phospholipid species. HA-exposed surfactant reaches very high efficiency in terms of rapid and spontaneous adsorption of surfactant phospholipids at the air-liquid interface and shows significantly improved resistance to inactivation by serum or cholesterol. We propose that physical effects pertaining to the formation of a meshwork of interpenetrating HA polymer chains are responsible for the changes in surfactant structure and composition that enhance surfactant function and, thus, resistance to inactivation. The higher resistance of HA-exposed surfactant to inactivation persists even after removal of the polymer, suggesting that transient exposure of surfactant to polymers like HA could be a promising strategy for the production of more efficient therapeutic surfactant preparations."
https://openalex.org/W2046855245,"A pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the presence of amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) plaques in the brain. Aβ is derived from a sequential proteolysis of the transmenbrane amyloid precursor protein (APP), a process which is dependent on the distribution of lipids present in the plasma membrane. Sphingomyelin is a major membrane lipid, however its role in APP processing is unclear. Here, we assessed the expression of sphingomyelin synthase (SGMS1; the gene responsible for sphingomyelin synthesis) in human brain and found that it was significantly elevated in the hippocampus of AD brains, but not in the cerebellum. Secondly, we assessed the impact of altering SGMS activity on Aβ generation. Inhibition of SGMS activity significantly reduced the level of Aβ in a dose- and time dependent manner. The decrease in Aβ level occurred without changes in APP expression or cell viability. These results when put together indicate that SGMS activity impacts on APP processing to produce Aβ and it could be a contributing factor in Aβ pathology associated with AD."
https://openalex.org/W2069288279,"Neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) mediates down-regulation of human norepinephrine (NE) transporter (hNET) via protein kinase C (PKC). However, native NET regulation by NK1R and the mechanism by which NK1R targets NET among other potential effectors are unknown. Effect of NK1R activation on native NET regulation and NET/NK1R interaction were studied using rat brain synaptosomes expressing native NET and NK1R as well as human placental trophoblast (HTR) cells coexpressing WT-hNET or NK1R/PKC-resistant hNET-T258A,S259A double mutant (NET-DM) and hNK1R. The selective NK1R agonist, GR73632, and Substance-P (SP) inhibited NE transport and reduced plasma membrane expression of NET and NK1R. Pretreatment with the NK1R antagonist, EMEND (aprepitant) prevented these NK1R-mediated effects. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that NET forms stable complexes with NK1R. In HTR cells, combined biotinylation and immunoprecipitation studies revealed plasma membrane localization of NET·NK1R complexes. Receptor activation resulted in the internalization of NET·NK1R complexes. Lipid raft and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed the presence of NET·NK1R complexes exclusively in non-raft membrane fractions under basal/unstimulated conditions. However, NK1R activation led to translocation of NET·NK1R complexes to raft-rich membrane fractions. Importantly, PKCα was found in association with raft-localized NET following SP treatment. Similar to WT-NET, PKC-resistant NET-DM was found in association with NK1R exclusively in non-raft fractions. However, SP treatment failed to translocate NET-DM·NK1R complexes from non-raft fractions to raft fractions. Collectively, these results suggest that NK1R forms physical complexes with NET and that the receptor-mediated Thr(258) + Ser(259) motif-dependent translocation of NET·NK1R complexes into raft-rich microdomains facilitates NET/NK1R interaction with PKCα to coordinate spatially restricted NET regulation."

Here, we show that the AAA domain of the Caenorhabditis elegans FIGL-1 protein (CeFIGL-1-AAA), in clear contrast to homologous AAA domains, has an unusually high ATPase activity and forms a hexamer in solution.

https://openalex.org/W2115792215,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is caused by mutations in PKD1 or PKD2, and it affects over 10 million people worldwide. It is characterized by cyst formation in the kidney, liver and pancreas. Dosage changes in PKD1/PKD2 are important in ADPKD pathogenesis; therefore, their expression and function has to be strictly regulated. However, how they are regulated remain poorly understood. Recent studies have linked PKD2 regulation to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that is implicated in neuronal, cardiac, and renal diseases. One major ER stress downstream is phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2α by kinase PERK, which attenuates global protein translation and enhances translation of selected proteins. Here, we showed in several mammalian cell lines that PKD2 protein expression is up-regulated by different stresses that all increase phosphorylated eIF2α (P-eIF2α). Increasing P-eIF2α by overexpression or inhibiting the phosphatase activity resulted in increased PKD2. PCR and polysome-binding assays showed that ER stress does not affect the PKD2 mRNA level but increase its binding with ribosomes, indicating that P-eIF2α translationally up-regulates PKD2. By mutation analysis, we found that the upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the 5'-untranslated region of PKD2 mRNA represses PKD2 translation. Thus, ER stress and P-eIF2α translationally up-regulates PKD2 through bypassing the inhibitory uORF."
https://openalex.org/W2054311397,"Resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 8 (RIC8) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor required for the intracellular regulation of G protein signalling. RIC8 activates different Gα subunits via non-canonical pathway, thereby amplifying and prolonging the G protein mediated signal. In order to circumvent the embryonic lethality associated with the absence of RIC8A and to study its role in the nervous system, we constructed Ric8a conditional knockout mice using Cre/loxP technology. Introduction of a synapsin I promoter driven Cre transgenic mouse strain (SynCre) into the floxed Ric8a (Ric8aF/F) background ablated RIC8A function in most differentiated neuron populations. Mutant SynCre+/-Ric8lacZ/F mice were born at expected Mendelian ratio, but they died in early postnatal age (P4-P6). The mutants exhibited major developmental defects, like growth retardation and muscular weakness, impaired coordination and balance, muscular spasms and abnormal heart beat. Histological analysis revealed that the deficiency of RIC8A in neurons caused skeletal muscle atrophy and heart muscle hypoplasia, in addition, the sinoatrial node was misplaced and its size reduced. However, we did not observe gross morphological changes in brains of SynCre+/-Ric8alacZ/F mutants. Our results demonstrate that in mice the activity of RIC8A in neurons is essential for survival and its deficiency causes a severe neuromuscular phenotype."

All the rabbits underwent CT scans on day 7, 14, 21 and 28 after implantation to observe the size of the tumors, the time when metastases and ascites occurred and the survival time. Appropriate intervention times were estimated corresponding to different clinical HCC stages by using tumor diameter-time curve.The VX2 liver tumors grew rapidly within 28 days after implantation. And the tumors in the cell suspension group grew faster than those of the tissue fragment group. The appropriate intervention time corresponding to very early stage, early stage and intermediate stage were <11 days, 11-16.9 days and >16.9 days, respectively in the cell suspension group, and <19.9 days, 19.9-25.5 days and >25.5 days, respectively in the tissue fragment group.Preclinical animal research needs to improve on different levels to yield best predictions for human patients. Researchers should seek for an individualized proposal to select optimal VX2 liver tumor models for their experiments.
