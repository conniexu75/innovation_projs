https://openalex.org/W2140086733,"High specific activity estradiol labeled with iodine-125 was used to detect approximately 200 saturable, high-affinity (dissociation constant ≅ 1.0 nM) nuclear binding sites in rat (ROS 17/2.8) and human (HOS TE85) clonal osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cells. Of the steroids tested, only testosterone exhibited significant cross-reactivity with estrogen binding. RNA blot analysis with a complementary DNA probe to the human estrogen receptor revealed putative receptor transcripts of 6 to 6.2 kilobases in both rat and human osteosarcoma cells. Type I procollagen and transforming growth factor-β messenger RNA levels were enhanced in cultured human osteoblast-like cells treated with 1 nM estradiol. Thus, estrogen can act directly on osteoblasts by a receptor-mediated mechanism and thereby modulate the extracellular matrix and other proteins involved in the maintenance of skeletal mineralization and remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W1524123582,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is a macrophage-derived peptide that is known to be an important mediator in various physiologic and immunologic events. Although the effector function of TNF has received recent attention, there is relatively little information regarding factors that regulate TNF expression. Highly Ia-positive murine peritoneal macrophages obtained via complete Freund's adjuvant elicitation were challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and assessed for the production and regulation of TNF at the cellular and molecular levels. In response to 1 microgram/ml LPS, the kinetics of functionally active TNF reached a maximum at approximately 3-4 h. The plateau in TNF levels was concomitant with an accelerated increase in prostaglandin E2 production. The addition of exogenous PGE2 demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in LPS-induced TNF activity at the cellular level, as well as a significant reduction in TNF mRNA accumulation as assessed by Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis. The reduction in LPS-stimulated mRNA accumulation by PGE2 was shown to occur at least at the level of transcription, since nuclear run-off analysis showed a specific reduction in TNF transcripts. These studies demonstrate that PGE2 can regulate macrophage-derived TNF gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2161454032,"Human transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) was purified as a latent high Mr complex from human platelets by a six-step procedure. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions revealed that the complex was composed of at least three components with apparent Mr values of 13,000, 40,000, and 125,000-160,000. The 13-kDa subunit was part of a disulfide-bonded dimer and was identified by amino acid sequencing as TGF-beta 1. The 40-kDa subunit was identified as the amino-terminal part of the TGF-beta 1 precursor lacking the hydrophobic signal sequence. Partial sequencing of the 125-160-kDa protein revealed that it is distinct from known proteins. The 40-kDa and the 125-160-kDa subunits are linked by disulfide bonds, forming a complex with an apparent Mr of 210,000 on SDS gels under nonreducing conditions. Experiments with partial reduction revealed that each complex contains two 40-kDa components linked by disulfide bonds; in addition, the dimer is disulfide-linked to one 125-160-kDa binding protein. TGF-beta 1 binds noncovalently to the 210-kDa complex, and in bound form, TGF-beta 1 is inactive. Incubations of the latent form of TGF-beta 1 at extreme pH values, in 0.02% SDS or in 8 M urea, lead to activation of TGF-beta 1, whereas the complex was resistant to treatment with 5 M NaCl or heat (3 min at 95 degrees C)."
https://openalex.org/W1600868878,"Human platelets, when induced to degranulate by thrombin, secrete transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in a biologically latent form. In this form, TGF-beta cannot bind to its cellular receptor, nor can it be immunoprecipitated by polyclonal antisera to TGF-beta, suggesting that the receptor-binding site and other TGF-beta epitopes may be masked. Western blot analysis of the platelet secretate indicates that the latent form of TGF-beta is a 220-235 kDa complex, in which mature TGF-beta (25 kDa) is noncovalently associated with sequences from the remainder of the precursor (74 kDa), and a third unidentified entity (approximately 135 kDa). The third component is immunologically unrelated to other growth factor binding proteins. The complex is glycosylated, and gel filtration analysis suggests it may exist in solution as higher molecular weight aggregates. Further chromatographic analysis indicates that in its latent form, the platelet TGF-beta cannot bind to alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M), but that if the platelet latent TGF-beta is activated by transient acidification, the released active TGF-beta will bind to alpha 2M. We have previously identified the latent form of TGF-beta found in serum as an alpha 2M.TGF-beta complex (O'Connor-McCourt, M. D., and Wakefield, L. M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 14090-14099). We now propose that the latent TGF-beta secreted by platelets may be a cellular delivery complex, whereas the latent form found in serum may represent a clearance complex. Thus alpha 2M may scavenge excess TGF-beta that is released when the platelet latent form is activated, possibly by the clotting process. Finally, we have shown that the latent form of TGF-beta secreted by a variety of cell types in culture is similar, if not identical to that secreted by platelets."
https://openalex.org/W2096077209,"Transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with plasmids containing rat brain protein kinase C-I (PKC-I) cDNA controlled by strong viral promoter/enhancer elements led to PKC-I gene expression as assessed by Northern analysis, cellular binding of phorbol ester, immunoblotting of cellular PKC, and membrane-associated PKC activity. While transfection did not induce foci, altered growth regulation was observed in established transfectant lines: transfectants displayed reduced dependence on serum for growth, grew to higher saturation densities, and displayed enhanced tumorigenicity when inoculated into nude mice. Continued high-level expression of PKC-I, however, may not be obligatory for the malignant phenotype in vivo. Tumors that retained transfected sequences had lower PKC-I transcript levels than the parental in vitro lines, suggesting an in vivo modulation. Our data show that PKC-I dysregulation leads to altered cell growth regulation and may be functionally equivalent to the action of tumor promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2133404596,"There exists circumstantial evidence for activation of phospholipase D (PLD) in intact cells. However, because of the complexity of phospholipid remodeling processes, it is essential to distinguish PLD clearly from other phospholipases and phospholipid remodeling enzymes. Therefore, to establish unequivocally PLD activity in dimethyl sulfoxide-differentiated HL-60 granulocytes, to demonstrate the relative contribution of PLD to phospholipid turnover, and to validate the hypothesis that the formation of phosphatidylethanol is an expression of PLD-catalyzed transphosphatidylation, we have developed methodologies to label HL-60 granulocytes in 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (alkyl-PC) with 32P without labeling cellular ATP. These methodologies involve (a) synthesis of alkyl-lysoPC containing 32P by a combination of enzymatic and chemical procedures and (b) incubation of HL-60 granulocytes with this alkyl-[32P] lysoPC which enters the cell and becomes acylated into membrane-associated alkyl-[32P]PC. Upon stimulation of these 32P-labeled cells with the chemotactic peptide, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), alkyl-[32P]phosphatidic acid (alkyl-[32P]PA) is formed rapidly. Because, under these conditions, cellular ATP has not been labeled with 32P, alkyl-[32P]PA must be formed via PLD-catalyzed hydrolysis of alkyl-[32P]PC at the terminal phosphodiester bond. This result conclusively demonstrates fMLP-induced activation of PLD in HL-60 granulocytes. These 32P-labeled HL-60 granulocytes have also been stimulated in the presence of ethanol to produce alkyl-[32P]phosphatidylethanol (alkyl-[32P]PEt). Formation of alkyl-[32P]PEt parallels that of alkyl-[32P]PA with respect to time course, fMLP concentration, inhibition by a specific fMLP antagonist (t-butoxycarbonyl-Met-Leu-Phe), and Ca2+ concentration. These results strongly support the hypothesis that in HL-60 granulocytes, PEt is formed via PLD-catalyzed transphosphatidylation. Moreover, using HL-60 granulocytes double-labeled by incubation with [3H]alkyl-lysoPC and alkyl-[32P]lysoPC, it has been established that the early (30 s) appearance of alkyl-PA is due primarily to PLD, not phospholipase C as previously thought, and that alkyl-PEt is formed exclusively by PLD. These results constitute the first direct evidence for receptor-linked activation of PLD, leading to the generation of PA and PEt in an intact cell system."
https://openalex.org/W2114950491,"The cell surface proteoglycan fraction isolated by mild trypsin treatment of NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial cells contains largely heparan sulfate, but also 15-24% chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans. We conclude that this fraction contains a unique hybrid proteoglycan bearing both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans because (i) the proteoglycan behaves as a single species by sizing, ion exchange and collagen affinity chromatography, and by isopycnic centrifugation, even in the presence of 8 M urea or 4 M guanidine hydrochloride, (ii) the behavior of the chondroitin sulfate in these separation techniques is affected by heparan sulfate-specific probes and vice versa, and (iii) proteoglycan core protein bearing both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate is recognized by a single monoclonal antibody. Removal of both types of glycosaminoglycan reduces the proteoglycan to a core protein of approximately 53 kDa. The proteoglycan fraction is heterogeneous in size, largely due to a variable number and/or length of the glycosaminoglycan chains. We estimate that one or two chondroitin sulfate chains (modal Mr of 17,000) exist on the proteoglycan for every four heparan sulfate chains (modal Mr of 36,000). Synthesis of these chains is reportedly initiated on an identical trisaccharide that links the chains to the same amino acid residues on the core protein. Therefore, some regulatory information, perhaps residing in the amino acid sequence of the core protein, must determine the type of chain synthesized at any given linkage site. Post-translational addition of these glycosaminoglycans to the protein may provide information affecting its ultimate localization. It is likely that the protein is directed to specific sites on the cell surface because of the ability of the glycosaminoglycans to recognize and bind extracellular components."
https://openalex.org/W1582355914,"The effect of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) has been studied in a bovine articular cartilage organ culture. The peptide stimulates synthesis of proteoglycans in a dose-dependent manner, reaching saturation at 10 ng/ml. This dose gave an approximate 7-fold increase in synthesis over basal controls. In addition, the peptide decreased the rates of catabolism of proteoglycans with an approximately 2-fold maximal effect seen at 5 ng/ml. At the latter concentration, TGF-beta prevented the 4-fold loss of proteoglycans which occurred in cultures maintained under basal conditions over the course of 3 weeks. There was no increase in cell (DNA) content of the cartilage explants under these conditions of TGF-beta treatment, and the net collagen content of the explants remained constant."

https://openalex.org/W2054270892,"Because of the difficulty in identifying the date of exposure to type 1 of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in persons other than transfusion recipients, studies of the incubation periods for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have been limited. When data from a cohort of 84 homosexual and bisexual men that provided the information to determine the years of conversion of sera infected with HIV-1 were analyzed, a model for the proportion likely to develop AIDS and the incubation period for AIDS in homosexual men could be derived. The maximum likelihood estimate for the proportion of infected homosexual men developing AIDS is 0.99 (90% confidence interval ranging from 0.38 to 1). Furthermore, the maximum likelihood estimate for the mean incubation period for AIDS in homosexual men is 7.8 years (90% confidence interval ranging from 4.2 years to 15.0 years), which is close to the estimate of 8.2 years for adults developing transfusion-associated AIDS."

https://openalex.org/W1529366818,"Platelet membrane glycoproteins (GP) IIb and IIIa form a Ca2+-dependent, heterodimer complex (GP IIb-IIIa) in detergent solution. To determine whether these glycoproteins were complexed or dissociated in intact human platelets, 125I-labeled whole platelets were lysed with an EDTA/Triton X-100 buffer, which stabilized both the complexed and dissociated forms of GP IIb and GP IIIa. The percentage of the heterodimer complex present after lysis was determined by quantitating the sedimentation of GP IIIa in sucrose gradients. The distribution of GP IIIa in sucrose gradient fractions from unlabeled platelets was detected by incubation of 125I-concanavalin A with Western blots. It was determined that GP IIb and GP IIIa existed predominantly as the GP IIb-IIIa complex in either unstimulated (92% complexed) or thrombin-stimulated (90% complexed) platelets. The GP IIb-IIIa complex in unstimulated platelets could be reversibly dissociated by brief (up to 10-min) incubations at 37 degrees C with EDTA, while longer (30-min) incubations with EDTA resulted in irreversible polymerization of GP IIb and GP IIIa. The dissociation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex by EDTA in intact cells was temperature-dependent, and the critical extracellular Ca2+ concentration for dissociation was 10(-5) to 10(-6) M. These results demonstrate that GP IIb and GP IIIa exist as a Ca2+-dependent, heterodimer complex in intact platelets and that treatment of platelets with EDTA can have multiple effects on this complex."
https://openalex.org/W1534398269,"The formation of vertebrate neural circuitry is regulated in part by neurotrophic agents, such as nerve growth factor (NGF); however, the biochemical mechanisms involved in neurite outgrowth have yet to be completely resolved. Phorbol ester tumor promoters are known to influence the extension of neurites in a variety of neurodevelopmental systems, and protein kinase C, the major phorbol ester receptor, has been implicated in this process. In the present study, sphingosine, a specific pharmacological inhibitor of protein kinase C, was employed to investigate the role of this enzyme in the elaboration of neurites in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. Normally, PC12 cells respond to NGF by morphologically differentiating into sympathetic neuron-like cells, exhibiting a marked hypertrophy, and extending slender neurites piloted by well defined growth cones. The elaboration of NGF-induced neurites was found to be reversibly inhibited by sphingosine in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 2.5-5 microM), while similar concentrations of several structural analogs were inactive. The suppression of neurite outgrowth by sphingosine was antagonized by the addition of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), which binds to and directly activates protein kinase C. In the presence of NGF, TPA treatment increased the incidence of neurite outgrowth, and this increase, in turn, was antagonized by sphingosine. The binding of [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate to specific phorbol ester binding sites in PC12 cells was inhibited by sphingosine at concentrations similar to those which inhibited neurite outgrowth. The effects of sphingosine on TPA-directed protein phosphorylation were examined in situ, revealing inhibition of [32P]phosphate incorporation into cellular proteins. The specific TPA-directed phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase was inhibited by sphingosine, as was the resulting increase in enzyme activity. The effects of sphingosine on the levels of alpha- and beta-tubulin mRNAs were also examined in an effort to delimit the locus of protein kinase C action. Concentrations of sphingosine which suppressed neurite outgrowth did not inhibit the NGF-directed elevation of tubulin transcript levels. Taken together, these results reveal the presence of a sphingosine-sensitive pathway in neurite outgrowth and indicate that protein kinase C plays a role in mediating the neuritogenic effects of NGF. Furthermore, the results suggest that protein kinase C acts at a distal segment of the neurite growth pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1560197506,"Both bryostatin 1 and 4 beta-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PBt2) activate Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) at the plasma membrane in HL-60 cells (Kraft, A. S., Baker, V. V., and May, W. S. (1987) Oncogene 1, 91-100). However, whereas PBt2 causes HL-60 cells to cease dividing and differentiate, bryostatin 1 antagonizes this effect and allows cells to continue proliferating. To test whether these divergent effects could be due to the differential activation of protein kinase C at the nuclear level, the phosphorylation of nuclear envelope polypeptides was evaluated in cells treated with either bryostatin 1 or PBt2. Bryostatin 1, either alone or in combination with PBt2, but not PBt2 alone, mediates rapid and specific phosphorylation of several nuclear envelope polypeptides. A major target for bryostatin-induced phosphorylation is the major nuclear envelope polypeptide lamin B (Mr = 67,000, pI 6.0). In vitro studies combining purified protein kinase C and HL-60 cell nuclear envelopes demonstrate that bryostatin activates protein kinase C to phosphorylate lamin B, whereas PBt2 does so only weakly, suggesting selective activation of this enzyme toward this substrate. Comparative phosphopeptide and phosphoamino acid analyses demonstrate that bryostatin induces phosphorylation of identical serine sites on lamin B both in whole cells and in vitro. Treatment of whole cells with bryostatin, but not PBt2, leads to specific translocation of activated protein kinase C to the nuclear envelope. Since phosphorylation of lamin B is known to be involved in nuclear lamina depolymerization at the time of mitosis, it is possible that bryostatin-activated protein kinase C activity is involved in this process. Finally, specific activation of protein kinase C at the nuclear membrane could explain, at least in part, the divergent effects of bryostatin 1 and PBt2 on HL-60 cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1493516959,"The regulation of protein phosphorylation by sphingosine in A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells was examined. Sphingosine is a competitive inhibitor of phorbol ester binding to protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) and potently inhibits phosphotransferase activity in vitro. Addition of sphingosine to intact A431 cells caused an inhibition of the phorbol ester-stimulated phosphorylation of two protein kinase C substrates, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor threonine 654 and transferrin receptor serine 24. We conclude that sphingosine inhibits the activity of protein kinase C in intact A431 cells. However, further experiments demonstrated that sphingosine-treatment of A431 cells resulted in the regulation of the EGF receptor by a mechanism that was independent of protein kinase C. First, sphingosine caused an increase in the threonine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor on a unique tryptic peptide. Second, sphingosine caused an increase in the affinity of the EGF receptor in A431 and in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing wild-type (Thr654) and mutated (Ala654) EGF receptors. Sphingosine was also observed to cause an increase in the number of EGF-binding sites expressed at the surface of A431 cells. Examination of the time course of sphingosine action demonstrated that the effects on EGF binding were rapid (maximal at 2 mins) and were observed prior to the stimulation of receptor phosphorylation (maximal at 20 mins). We conclude that sphingosine is a potently bioactive molecule that modulates cellular functions by: 1) inhibiting protein kinase C; 2) stimulating a protein kinase C-independent pathway of protein phosphorylation; and 3) increasing the affinity and number of cell surface EGF receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1544973014,"To study the mechanism of active drug efflux in multidrug-resistant cells, the interaction between [3H] vincristine (VCR) and plasma membrane prepared from an adriamycin (ADM)-resistant variant (K562/ADM) of human myelogenous leukemia K562 cells was examined by filtration method. [3H]VCR bound to the plasma membrane prepared from K562/ADM cells, but not from parental K562 cells, depending on the concentrations of ATP and Mg2+. Adenosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate was not effective in the binding of [3H]VCR, indicating that ATP hydrolysis is required for this binding. Dissociation constant (Kd) of VCR binding was 0.24 +/- 0.04 microM in the presence of 3 mM ATP. In the absence of ATP, specific binding of VCR to K562/ADM membrane was also observed; however, the affinity (Kd = 9.7 +/- 3.1 microM) was 40 times lower than that observed in the presence of ATP. The high affinity VCR binding to K562/ADM membrane was dependent on temperature. The bound [3H]VCR molecules were rapidly released by unlabeled VCR added to the reaction mixture at 25 degrees C. The high affinity binding of [3H]VCR to K562/ADM membrane was inhibited by VCR, vinblastine, actinomycin D, and ADM, to which K562/ADM cells exhibit cross-resistance, whereas 5-fluorouracil and camptothecin, to which K562/ADM cells are equally sensitive as K562 cells, did not inhibit the [3H]VCR binding. Furthermore, verapamil and other agents, which are known to circumvent drug resistance by inhibiting the active efflux of antitumor agents from resistant cells, could also inhibit the high affinity [3H]VCR binding. These results indicate that ATP/Mg2+-dependent high affinity VCR binding to the membrane of resistant cells closely correlates with the active drug efflux of this resistant cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1549949535,"To define the role of membrane components that function in endothelial cell physiology and to characterize them biochemically, we have attempted to prepare monoclonal antibodies specific for endothelial cells. Several clones were obtained producing antibodies which bound to endothelial cells and also to platelets. The antibody of one of these clones, CLB-HEC 75, was studied in more detail. This antibody is directed against a single protein which is synthesized constitutively by endothelial cells and is expressed on the surface of both endothelial cells and platelets. The CLB-HEC 75 antigen was isolated from Nonidet P-40-solubilized endothelial cells and platelets by immunoprecipitation and exhibited an apparent molecular weight by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of approximately 145,000 in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and crossed immunoelectrophoresis revealed that the mobility of the CLB-HEC 75 antigen relative to platelet glycoproteins Ib, IIa, IIb, and IIIa fits previously defined criteria for platelet membrane glycoprotein IIa. The CLB-HEC 75 antigen isolated from endothelial cells co-migrated under all conditions tested with the antigen from platelets. These results indicate that endothelial cells share a plasma membrane protein indistinguishable from platelet membrane glycoprotein IIa. This protein may be a component involved in the interaction of endothelial cells with their environment including coagulation factors, platelets, and the subendothelial matrix. CLB-HEC 75 may serve as a useful tool for studying these processes."
https://openalex.org/W1516041101,"The analysis of free sulfhydryl groups in factor Va using dithiobis-(nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) indicated the presence of one accessible thiol in each of the two subunits of the cofactor. Intact factor Va contained one readily accessible sulfhydryl group under native conditions and approximately two such groups after denaturation. A comparison of the rate of modification of the accessible thiol in factor Va under native conditions to those observed with the isolated subunits indicated that the thiol present in component D of the cofactor was readily accessible to reaction with DTNB. Factor Va was reacted with the sulfhydryl-directed fluorophore N-(1-pyrene)maleimide, resulting in the concomitant loss of the accessible thiol with no detectable alteration in the activity of the cofactor. This fluorescent derivative of factor Va (Pyr-Va) was used to examine the binding of factor Va to phospholipid vesicles by fluorescence polarization. Fluorescence polarization of the pyrene moiety increased saturably when Pyr-Va was titrated with increasing concentrations of vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine (PS). Systematic analysis of the binding of Pyr-Va to PCPS (75% phosphatidylcholine, 25% PS) indicated that the binding interaction was characterized by a dissociation constant of 2.7 x 10(-9) M with 42 mol of PCPS bound per mol of Va at saturation. The data obtained by varying the PS content of the vesicles are consistent with the interpretation that the Va-combining site on the vesicle surface is composed of a discrete number of PS molecules. The binding of Pyr-Va to PCPS was independent of added calcium ion and could be reversed by the addition of unlabeled Va or isolated component E but not by component D. Analysis of the displacement curves indicated that native factor Va or isolated component E and Pyr-Va mutually excluded each other on the vesicle surface with identical affinities. Competition experiments conducted using component E digested by factor Xa or the isolated derivative peptides indicated that the cleavage of component E by factor Xa had no effect on the PCPS binding properties of this subunit. Further, the data obtained with the isolated peptides suggest that the lipid-binding domain of component E is present in the amino-terminal region of this subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1572701068,"mRNA specific for tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is induced in HeLa cells by the tumor promoter phorbol myristate acetate (Waller, E.K., and Schleuning, W.D. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 6354-6360). To study the underlying mechanism, a cDNA library was constructed from phorbol myristate acetate stimulated HeLa cell mRNA and screened with two t-PA mRNA specific oligonucleotides (Edlund, T., Ny, T., Ranby, M., Heden, L.-O., Palm, G., Holmgren, E., and Josephson, S. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 349-352). Two nearly full length double-stranded cDNA clones were obtained. Suitable restriction fragments from the cDNA were employed as probes for the isolation of three recombinant bacteriophages, containing overlapping fragments of the t-PA gene. By restriction analysis, heteroduplex mapping, and DNA sequencing it was determined that the three overlapping fragments contain the complete t-PA structural gene and that the 2658 bases long t-PA mRNA is encoded by a gene of approximately 29 kilobases overall length, which is interrupted by 13 introns. To characterize the presumptive control region, a subcloned gene fragment, containing the 5' sequence of the cDNA, was sequenced, and the transcription initiation site was identified by nuclease S1 protection experiments. The putative transcription start site is located 24 base pairs (bp) downstream of a typical TATA consensus sequence. Two additional TATA motifs with hitherto unknown functions are found 93 and 226 bp upstream of the putative cap site. A recombinant plasmid was constructed, which accommodates the cap site including 475 bp of upstream sequences, fused to a double-stranded cDNA of t-PA mRNA which contains the complete translated and parts of the 5' and 3' untranslated regions. This plasmid directs t-PA biosynthesis in Xenopus laevis oocytes after microinjection into the germinal vesicle."

(1985) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 846, 26-36). TLC immunostaining studies with the VIM-2 antibody of gangliosides from normal human neutrophils, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic myelogenous leukemia cells showed that the total amount and the ratio of the VIM-2 gangliosides varies among these different myeloid cells and appears to be related to the level of cellular differentiation. Purification of these gangliosides from chronic myelogenous leukemia cells was aided by a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedure used in conjunction with high performance liquid chromatography. Structures for two of the immunoreactive gangliosides (a ceramide decasaccharide, VIII3NeuAcV3-Fuc-nLc8Cer and a ceramide dodecasaccharide X3-NeuAcVII3Fuc-nLc10Cer) are proposed from negative ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry of the native gangliosides, methylation analysis, and the combined use of glycosidase treatment and TLC immunostaining with carbohydrate sequence specific antibodies. The VIM-2 antigen was thus characterized as involving the sialofucooligosaccharide sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1563674780,"The ada gene of Escherichia coli encodes a 39-kDa protein which serves both as a transcriptional activator of the adaptive response to alkylating agents and as a DNA repair enzyme demethylating O6-methyl-guanine and phosphotriester residues. Here, the isolated Ada protein was found to be readily cleaved into two fragments of similar size by treatment with trypsin, chymotrypsin, subtilisin, or V8 protease. The fragments retained their respective methyltransferase activities. The Ada protein is, therefore, comprised of two stable active domains united by a central hinge region of about 10 amino acids. Post-translational modification of the Ada protein by methylation of a specific cysteine residue in the NH2-terminal domain is known to convert it to an efficient transcriptional activator. This residue has now been identified as Cys-69."
https://openalex.org/W1599049360,"Antistasin is a 15-kDa protein from the salivary glands of the Mexican leech, Haementeria officinalis, which manifests anticoagulant activity by inhibiting factor Xa. Previous work demonstrating the presence of this activity in salivary gland extracts and its partial purification has been reported (Tuszynski, G. P., Gasic, T. B, and Gasic, G.J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9718-9723). The present study includes further purification to homogeneity of antistasin and its subsequent fragmentation and complete amino acid sequence determination. The protein, which possesses 119 amino acid residues, is blocked at its amino terminus by the presence of a pyroglutamic acid residue and has an unusually high cysteine content, with 20 cysteine residues. The primary structure of antistasin shows no homology to hirudin, a 65-residue anticoagulant protein from the medicinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis. Of great interest is the finding of significant internal homology within antistasin where a 2-fold internal repeated structure is observed. At least four isoforms of antistasin have been identified in leech salivary gland extracts by high performance liquid chromatography analysis, and partial amino acid sequence analysis of these isoforms indicates they differ by 1 or 2 amino acid residues."

Regulation of expression of the enzyme occurs at the level of mRNA transcription as well as posttranslationally, the latter involving the processing of a previously unidentified pre-proenzyme (zymogen) sequence.

https://openalex.org/W2122633495,"Antithrombin Northwick Park and antithrombin Glasgow are functionally variant antithrombins with impaired abilities to interact with thrombin. Thrombosis is associated with their inheritance. Both of the purified, reduced, and S-carboxymethylated variant antithrombins were treated with cyanogen bromide and the major pools of each containing the amino acid sequence Gly339-Met423 were isolated. Following treatment of these pools with trypsin, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry identified tryptic peptides (found also in normal antithrombin treated in the same way) that corresponded to amino acid sequences Gly339-Lys370 and Val400-Met423. The tryptic peptides, corresponding to amino acid sequences Ala371-Arg393 and Ser394-Arg399 were present in both variant preparations in greatly reduced amounts compared to a normal antithrombin preparation. However, two novel tryptic peptides of molecular mass (M + H)+ 2976 and 2952 were identified in the digests of antithrombin Northwick Park and Glasgow, respectively. Further analyses of these novel tryptic peptides were carried out by V8 protease treatment and sequential Edman degradation coupled with mass spectrometric analysis of the shortened peptides. This established that these peptides comprised the amino acid sequence Ala371-Arg399, but with single amino acid substitutions at the reactive site, Arg393 replaced by Cys (in antithrombin Northwick Park) and by His (in antithrombin Glasgow)."
https://openalex.org/W1607767749,"Two overlapping cosmids have been isolated containing the entire murine gene for SPARC (osteonectin), a Ca2+-binding, phosphorylated glycoprotein associated with extracellular matrix synthesis and remodeling. The gene contains 10 exons and covers 26.5 kilobase pairs of DNA. Exon analysis shows that the two N-terminal glutamic acid-rich sequences which are predicted to undergo conformational change upon binding of calcium, as well as the C-terminal EF-hand Ca2+-binding domain are each encoded by a single exon. Comparative analysis of the exon sequence does not support the idea that the SPARC gene has evolved by shuffling of exons from other Ca2+-binding proteins. The 5' flanking region of the SPARC gene, which promotes transcription when placed in front of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, contains neither TATA nor CAAT box sequences. However, unlike most other genes lacking these motifs, mapping of the 5' end of the SPARC gene by RNase protection and primer extension analysis reveals only a single major and one minor transcription start site. The upstream region to -120 includes six repeats of the sequence GGAGG, two repeats of the sequence 5' GGAGG A/C GGAGGG 3', and a potential transcription factor AP-2 binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1575506960,"Trypsin inhibitory activity from the hemolymph of the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) was purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized trypsin and resolved into two fractions with molecular weights of 14,000 (M. sexta hemolymph trypsin inhibitor (HLTI) A) and 8,000 (HLTI B) by molecular sieve chromatography on Sephadex G-75. Electrophoresis of these inhibitors under reducing conditions on polyacrylamide gels gave molecular weight estimates of 8,300 for HLTI A and 9,100 for HLTI B, suggesting that HLTI A is a dimer and HLTI B is a monomer. Isoelectrofocusing on polyacrylamide gels focused HLTI A as a single band with pI 5.7, whereas HLTI B was resolved into two components with pI values of 5.3 and 7.1. Both inhibitors were stable at 100 degrees C and pH 1.0 for at least 30 min. HLTIs A and B inhibited serine proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and plasmin, but did not inhibit elastase, papain, pepsin, subtilisin BPN', and thermolysin. In fact, subtilisin BPN' completely inactivated both inhibitors. Both inhibitors formed low-dissociation complexes with trypsin in a 1:1 molar ratio. The inhibition constant for trypsin inhibition by HLTI A was estimated to be 1.45 x 10(-8) M. The HLTI A-chymotrypsin complex did not inhibit trypsin; similarly, the HLTI A-trypsin complex did not inhibit chymotrypsin, indicating that HLTI A has a common binding site for both trypsin and chymotrypsin. The amino-terminal amino acid sequences of HLTIs A and B revealed that both these inhibitors are homologous to bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz)."
https://openalex.org/W1483346790,"Multiple cis-acting regulatory elements have been mapped within a 1-kilobase fragment spanning nucleotides -651 through +356 of the human apolipoprotein E gene using a transient expression system based on the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene as well as DNase I footprinting techniques. A 651-base pair 5′-flanking region of the human apolipoprotein E gene was capable of directing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression over a 48-fold range among the various cultured cell lines tested. Deletion analysis of this 651-base pair upstream region linked to either the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene or the intact apolipoprotein E structural sequences revealed at least three regulatory domains within the proximal 383 nucleotides. One of these domains contained a GC box transcriptional control element. Further analysis demonstrated that the other two domains contained enhancer-like activity. These enhancer-like elements were located within the nucleotides spanning -366 to -246 and -193 to -124. A third enhancer element was identified in the first intron, within nucleotides +44 to +262. Changing the distance of the three enhancer elements from the transcription start site and reversing their orientation did not significantly alter their effects on transcription rates. However, enhancer activity was influenced by the promoter and cell line that were used. DNase I footprinting assays showed that specific sequences within two of these elements (-193 to -124 and +44 to +262) bind proteins in nuclear extracts from HepG2 and Chinese hamster ovary cells. A protein footprint also was identified for a GC box element at nucleotides -59 to -45. Thus, control of apolipoprotein E gene expression is the result of a complex interaction of several different regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W1576992065,"We have isolated and analyzed the gene for batroxobin, a thrombin-like snake venom enzyme. Three overlapping DNA segments containing the entire batroxobin gene were identified. Sequence analysis revealed that the batroxobin gene spans 8 kilobase pairs and contains five exons. Mature batroxobin is encoded by four separate exons, 2 to 5. The catalytic residues of batroxobin, His-41, Asp-86, and Ser-178, are encoded by separate exons, exons 2, 3, and 5, respectively. The exon/intron organization of the batroxobin gene is different from that of the prothrombin gene but very similar to those of the trypsin and kallikrein genes. These results indicate that batroxobin is not a member of the prothrombin family but one of the trypsin/kallikrein family. The snake venom gland is assumed to originate from the submaxillary gland. Therefore, batroxobin is expected to be a member of the glandular kallikrein family."
https://openalex.org/W1554036089,"The asialoglycoprotein (ASGP) receptor on Hep G2 cells undergoes constitutive recycling and ligand endocytosis in the presence of phorbol dibutyrate, at a 50% reduced rate relative to control cells (Fallon, R. J., and Schwartz, A. L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15081-15089). The relevance of receptor phosphorylation to these events was investigated by selective immunoprecipitation of surface receptors with polyclonal anti-human ASGP antiserum and pulse-chase labeling with [32P]orthophosphate to identify subcellular locations of initial receptor phosphorylation events as well as the eventual fate of phosphorylated receptor during recycling. The surface immunoprecipitation method recovers greater than 95% of surface ASGP receptors and only 5% or less of intracellular (brief[35S]methionine pulse-labeled) receptors. With this assay we detected low levels of ASGP receptor phosphorylation at the cell surface in control cells (0.1 mol of P/mol of R) which were rapidly (less than 1 min) stimulated 20-fold by 400 nM phorbol dibutyrate addition (1.7 mol of P/mol of R). Staurosporine, a protein kinase C inhibitor, blocks this stimulation by phorbol. Receptor phosphorylation at early time points in the presence of phorbol esters was restricted to the plasma membrane. Subsequent chase in the presence of excess unlabeled phosphate and phorbol esters lowered [32P] ATPi specific activity by 68% at 1 h. Surface immunoprecipitation during this chase period showed the phosphorylated ASGP receptors were rapidly lost from the cell surface (t1/2 = 20 min). In contrast, examination of intracellular receptor during the pulse-chase experiment in phorbol dibutyrate-treated cells showed the presence of phosphorylated pool(s) of ASGP receptors which were detectable for 6 h of chase. Since no labeled receptor can be detected at the cell surface at this time, the described intracellular phosphorylated receptors are in a non-recycling pool."
https://openalex.org/W206244674,"Abstract The human apolipoprotein B (apoB) gene codes for two related proteins, apoB-100 and apoB-48. ApoB-100 is synthesized in the liver, is the major protein constituent of low density lipoprotein, and serves as the ligand for the LDL receptor. cis-acting DNA sequence elements required for hepatic specific apoB transcription were identified in hepatoma (HepG2) and epithelial carcinoma (HeLa) cell lines transfected with apoB/CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) hybrid constructions. HepG2 cells express the transfected apoB constructions at high levels relative to expression in HeLa cells. Mutational analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the apoB gene revealed the presence of positive and negative regulatory regions. The most distal of these regions, located from -261 to -128 (with respect to the start site of transcription), was found to have a roughly equivalent negative activity in both cell types. However, sequences located from -128 to -86 showed a positive activity in HepG2 cells and a negative activity in HeLa cells. Finally, a sequence element located between positions -86 and -70 was found to have a very strong positive effect in HepG2 cells and only a mild positive effect in HeLa cells. These two proximal regions located between -128 and -70 appear to act together to determine the cell type-specific expression of the apoB gene in HepG2 and HeLa cells. Using the gel mobility shift assay and the DNase I footprinting technique, we demonstrated that DNA binding proteins from HepG2 and mouse liver nuclear extracts interact with the crucial positive region located between -86 and -70. This region was also found to contain sequence elements similar to sequences found in the promoters of other apolipoprotein genes, as well as other genes that are expressed in the liver, suggesting that these genes may share some transcriptional regulatory components."
https://openalex.org/W1555767583,"Chondroitin sulfate represents approximately 15% of the 35SO4-labeled glycosaminoglycans carried by the proteoglycans of the cell surface and of the basolateral secretions of normal mouse mammary epithelial cells in culture. Evidence is provided that these chondroitin sulfate-carrying proteoglycans are hybrid proteoglycans, carrying both chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate chains. Complete N-desulfation but limited O-desulfation, by treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide, of the proteoglycans decreased the anionic charge of the chondroitin sulfate-carrying proteoglycans to a greater extent than it decreased the charge of their constituent chondroitin sulfate chains. Partial depolymerization of the heparan sulfate residues of the proteoglycans with nitrous acid or with heparin lyase also reduced the effective molecular radius of the chondroitin sulfate-carrying proteoglycans. The effect of heparin lyase on the chondroitin sulfate-carrying proteoglycans was prevented by treating the proteoglycan fractions with dimethyl sulfoxide, while the effect of nitrous acid on the dimethyl sulfoxide-treated proteoglycans was prevented by acetylation. This occurrence of heparan sulfate-chondroitin sulfate hybrid proteoglycans suggests that the substitution of core proteins by heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate chains may not solely be determined by the specific routing of these proteins through distinct chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate synthesizing mechanisms. Moreover, regional and temporal changes in pericellular glycosaminoglycan compositions might be due to variable postsynthetic modification of a single gene product."
https://openalex.org/W1521454905,"5-Lipoxygenase has been expressed in a mammalian osteosarcoma cell line transfected with the cloned cDNA for human leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase. Two clonal cell lines derived from the transfected cells expressed the enzymatic activity. When incubated with arachidonic acid (100 microM), the major 5-lipoxygenase products of 10,000 X g supernatants from these cells were 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), and the nonenzymatic hydrolysis products of leukotriene (LT)A4. The ratio of 5-HETE to LT (between 6:1 and 9:1) was similar to that observed in leukocyte supernatants. Furthermore, incubation of 10,000 X g supernatants from the transfected cells with 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE) (75 microM) resulted in the synthesis of LTA4 hydrolysis products. Control osteosarcoma cell supernatants produced no 5-HETE or LT from arachidonic acid or 5-HPETE. Maximal activity of the expressed enzyme required Ca2+, ATP, and two cellular stimulatory factors prepared from human leukocytes. Immunoblot analysis of supernatants from the osteosarcoma cell clones revealed an immunoreactive 80,000-dalton band that was indistinguishable from the band observed in leukocyte supernatants. Therefore, the expressed enzyme was functional and exhibited characteristics that were identical to those of human leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase. When intact transfected osteosarcoma cells were challenged with ionophore A 23187, no 5-lipoxygenase products were formed. If arachidonic acid was added along with the ionophore, the cells synthesized 5-HETE and the nonenzymatic hydrolysis products of LTA4. These results verify that the cDNA used to transfect the osteosarcoma cells encodes for 5-lipoxygenase. Furthermore, these studies offer independent evidence that this single protein possesses both 5-lipoxygenase and LTA4 synthase activity, as has been reported previously from enzyme purification data."
https://openalex.org/W1676303642,"Abstract A sulfotransferase activity that catalyzes the transfer of sulfate ester group from 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate to carbohydrate chains of gastric mucus glycoprotein has been demonstrated in the antral and body mucosa of rat stomach. Subcellular fractionation studies revealed that the enzyme is associated with Golgi-rich membrane fraction. The sulfotransferase activity of this fraction in antral mucosa was about 35% lower than that in the body. Optimum enzyme activity was obtained with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 30 mM NaF at a pH of 6.8 using desulfated mucus glycoprotein substrate. The enzyme was equally capable of sulfation of the proteolytically degraded and reduced forms of the desulfated glycoprotein, but the acceptor capacity of the intact mucus glycoprotein was about 60% lower than that of the desulfated preparation. The enzyme preparation also catalyzed the transfer of sulfate to galactosylceramide. The sulfation of mucus glycoprotein, however, was not affected by the presence of this glycolipid, suggesting that the sulfotransferase involved in mucus glycoprotein sulfation is different from that responsible for the synthesis of sulfatoglycosphingolipid. The mucus glycoprotein sulfotransferase activity was inhibited by ethanol. The rate of inhibition was proportional to the concentration of ethanol up to 0.3 M and was of the competitive type. The apparent Km value of the enzyme for mucus glycoprotein was 10.5 X 10(-6) M (21 mg/ml), and the KI in the presence of ethanol was 4.7 x 10(-1) M. The 35S-labeled mucus glycoprotein product of the enzyme reaction gave in CsCl density gradient a band in which the 35S label coincided with the glycoprotein. Alkaline borohydride reductive cleavage of this glycoprotein led to the liberation of the label into reduced acidic oligo-saccharide fraction. Most of the label was found incorporated in three oligosaccharides. These were identified as tri-, tetra-, and pentasaccharides, each carrying a labeled sulfate ester group on the terminal N-acetyl-glucosamine residue. Based on the results of structural analyses, the most abundant oligosaccharide was characterized as SO3H----6GlcNAc beta 1----3Gal beta 1----3GalNAc-ol."
https://openalex.org/W1505235004,"When Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were incubated with bradykinin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis was stimulated. Phorbol esters or the diacylglycerol analog 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG), by themselves, did not acutely stimulate PGE2 synthesis. However, when cells were preincubated with phorbol esters or OAG, bradykinin-stimulated PGE2 synthesis was potentiated markedly. When phorbol esters and OAG were added together, bradykinin-stimulated PGE2 synthesis was potentiated in an additive manner. When cells were preincubated for 48 h with phorbol esters, then bradykinin added, amplification of bradykinin-stimulated PGE2 synthesis by phorbol ester or OAG was still apparent, even though prolonged pretreatment with phorbol esters abolished protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) activity in cell-free preparations. Further, the protein kinase C antagonist, H-7, only slightly inhibited phorbol ester or OAG amplification of bradykinin-stimulated PGE2 synthesis. The possibility is raised that diacylglycerol, formed in response to many receptors, may serve as a transducer of receptor-receptor interactions. Since desensitization or inhibition of protein kinase C only partially reduced the amplification of bradykinin-stimulated PGE2 synthesis by phorbol esters or OAG, the possibility is raised that diacylglycerol mimetics may have actions in addition to activation of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1491460621,"Mouse myeloid leukemic M1 cells are induced to differentiate by various differentiation inducers. Activity for inhibition of induction of differentiation of M1 cells (I-factor activity) was detected in conditioned medium of variant M1 cell clones that were resistant to differentiation inducers, and this I-factor activity was shown to be closely associated with resistance of the cells to differentiation inducers. In this work, the I-factor was purified to apparent homogeneity from conditioned medium of resistant M1 cells. The purification procedure consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation, CM-Sepharose CL-6B, Sephadex G-200, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 hydrophobic support, and high-performance liquid chromatography on a gel filtration column. The factor was analyzed by radioiodination, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and autoradiography. The purified factor gave a single band of protein with a molecular weight of 68,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis which coincided with its biological activity. The concentration of I-factor required for 50% inhibition of dexamethasone-induced differentiation of M1 cells was 24 pM. At its effective concentration it had no effect on cell proliferation, and even at 1.2 nM it did not inhibit colony formation of normal bone marrow cells, suggesting that it was distinct from the inhibitor of normal precursors of macrophages and/or granulocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1553370289,"Acanthamoeba myosins IA and IB are single-headed, monomeric molecules consisting of one heavy chain and one light chain. Both have high actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity, when the heavy chain is phosphorylated, but neither seems to be able to form the bipolar filaments that are generally thought to be required for actomyosin-dependent contractility. In this paper, we show that, at fixed F-actin concentration, the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activities of myosins IA and IB increase about 5-fold in specific activity in a cooperative manner as the myosin concentration is increased. The myosin concentration range over which this cooperative change occurs depends on the actin concentration. More myosin I is required for the cooperative increase in activity at high concentrations of F-actin. The cooperative increase in specific activity at limiting actin concentrations is caused by a decrease in the KATPase for F-actin. The high and low KATPase states of the myosin have about the same Vmax at infinite actin concentration. Both myosins are completely bound to the F-actin long before the Vmax values are reached. Therefore, much of the actin activation must be the result of interactions between F-actin and actomyosin. These kinetic data can be explained by a model in which the cooperative shift of myosin I from the high KATPase to the low KATPase state results from the cross-linking of actin filaments by myosin I. Cross-linking might occur either through two actin-binding sites on a single molecule or by dimers or oligomers of myosin I induced to form by the interaction of myosin I monomers with the actin filaments. The ability of Acanthamoeba myosins IA and IB to cross-link actin filaments is demonstrated in the accompanying paper (Fujisaki, H., Albanesi, J.P., and Korn, E.D. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11183-11189)."
https://openalex.org/W1537643998,"The activity of Escherichia coli phosphofructokinase-2 (Pfk-2) and of the mutant enzyme Pfk-2* was measured over a wide range of Mg2+ and ATP concentrations. MgATP2- inhibited only the Pfk-2 enzyme, with a degree of cooperativity of 1.5. This inhibition was relieved upon increasing the fructose-6-P concentration or by lowering the pH of the reaction mixture. Other nucleotides used as phosphate donors instead of ATP did not inhibit. MgATP2- was the true substrate for both enzymes and their Km values for this compound were not affected by an increase of the free Mg2+ concentration. However, free Mg2+ partially relieved the MgATP2- inhibition of Pfk-2 under conditions where the ATP4- concentration was negligible, without changes in the degree of cooperativity. ATP4- acted as a strong competitive inhibitor of both Pfk-2 and Pfk-2* with respect to MgATP2- with Ki values of 10 and 8 microM, respectively. ADP, AMP, and cAMP did not prevent the MgATP2- inhibition of Pfk-2. These results suggest the presence of an allosteric site for MgATP2- in Pfk-2 responsible for the MgATP2- inhibition, which is altered in Pfk-2* as a consequence of the structural mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1590359573,"We have tested effects of retinol bound to its physiological carrier molecules, i.e. low density lipoprotein chylomicron remnants, and retinol binding protein (RBP) on differentiation and proliferation of myeloid leukemic cells in concentrations that can be obtained in vivo. Data presented in this study show that physiological concentrations of retinyl ester in chylomicron remnants induce differentiation and inhibit proliferation of the cell line HL-60 and promyelocytic leukemic cells in primary culture. Retinyl ester in low density lipoprotein showed no effect either on cell differentiation or proliferation of any of the myeloid cells tested. Retinol bound to RBP induced differentiation of HL-60 cells only in concentrations above those that can be found in vivo. However, cell proliferation was reduced both in HL-60 cells and in primary culture of leukemic cells using physiological concentrations of holo-RBP. These results suggest that retinyl ester in chylomicron remnants is the most effective vehicle for transport of retinol into leukemic cells in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1582959803,"We have measured the transcriptional gene activity of 5-aminolevulinate synthase, the first enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway, together with corresponding mRNA and protein levels in mouse erythroleukemic cells induced to differentiate with dimethyl sulfoxide. When the heme biosynthetic pathway was blocked by succinylacetone there was a large increase in both 5-aminolevulinate synthase activity and protein levels, and this was reversed by the addition of exogenous hemin. Transcriptional activity of the 5-aminolevulinate synthase gene and mRNA levels were both significantly increased during differentiation of cells by dimethyl sulfoxide but were not markedly altered by succinylacetone or hemin treatment. The results demonstrate that levels of 5-aminolevulinate synthase in mouse erythroleukemic cells are regulated by a significant post-transcriptional mechanism possibly at the translational level. Evidence is also presented for a less significant post-transcriptional control by heme of mRNA levels for 5-aminolevulinate synthase. These results indicate that the regulation of 5-aminolevulinate synthase in differentiating erythroid cells is complex but differs from that in liver cells where heme controls the level of 5-aminolevulinate synthase by acting primarily to inhibit gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1608023661,"Formation and decomposition of the phosphorylated intermediate of endoplasmic reticulum (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase from pancreatic acinar cells have been studied using lithium dodecyl sulfate- and tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Incorporation of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP is Ca2+-dependent (approximate Km for free [Ca2+] = 2-3 X 10(-8) mol/liter). Formation of the 100-kDa phosphoprotein is rapid, reaching maximal 32Pi incorporation within 1 s at room temperature. At 4 degrees C, phosphorylation is slower and dephosphorylation is drastically decreased. For dephosphorylation, Mg2+ and monovalent cations such as K+ or Na+ are necessary. Vanadate inhibits both 32P incorporation and 32P liberation dose dependently (Km = 3 X 10(-6) mol/liter), whereas mitochondrial inhibitors and ouabain have no effect. The phosphoprotein is stable at pH 2 and destabilizes with increasing pH being completely decomposed at pH 9. Reduction of 32P incorporation in the presence of high concentrations of cold ATP and hydroxylamine suggests formation of acylphosphate present in the ATPase intermediate. The characteristics of Ca2+, cation, and pH dependencies of the ATPase activity are similar to those previously described for MgATP-dependent Ca2+ transport into rough endoplasmic reticulum from pancreatic acinar cells (Bayerdorffer, E., Streb, H., Eckhardt, L., Haase, W., and Schulz, I. (1984) J. Membr. Biol. 81, 69-82). The data suggest that the 100-kDa phosphoprotein as described in this study is the intermediate of this Ca2+ transport ATPase."

The protein was digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and the resulting peptides were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The masses of the protonated molecular ions (MH+) of the tryptic, chymotryptic, and S. aureus protease peptides were determined by liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis using 20-500 pmol of material. From the tryptic digest, two peptides with MH+ 1036 and 861 were initially found that did not match the published primary sequence (Sacchettini, J. C., Meininger, T. A., Lowe, J. B., Gordon, J.

The amino acid sequences of these two peptides were determined by a combination of mass spectrometry, B/E-linked scanning, and high performance tandem mass spectrometric techniques to be: (Formula: see text). These new data require that corrections be made to the previously published sequence, involving residues 1-4 and 51-52. The corrected amino sequence for rat m-FABP reveals greater homology with myelin P2, mouse adipocyte p422 protein, and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein than was previously demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1541110228,"During terminal differentiation of murine erythroleukemic (MEL) cells, the number of surface transferrin binding sites per cell decreases dramatically, while steady-state ligand uptake and immunoblotting studies demonstrate that the total number of transferrin receptors per cell remains constant. Since the amount of protein per cell decreases 4-fold during this 4-day period, the amount of transferrin receptor protein, relative to total soluble cell protein, increases 4-fold during this time, suggesting continued synthesis of the receptor. Supporting this, we show that the amount of transferrin receptor transcript in equal amounts of total cell RNA also increases as differentiation proceeds. Uninduced cells maintain 52% of the total transferrin binding sites on the cell surface, whereas only 22% of the receptors are on the surface in 4-day induced cells. All ligand endocytosed by either uninduced or induced cells at 37 degrees C is rapidly and completely exocytosed from the cells, suggesting that all of the cellular receptors are cycling. These studies suggest that, during MEL cell differentiation, an increasing fraction of transferrin receptors are localized to the cell interior, but are nevertheless cycling to the cell surface. This observed redistribution is due to altered kinetic parameters of the receptor. Receptor-bound 125I-labeled transferrin ligand has been followed through a single endocytic cycle. Ligand internalization occurs much more rapidly in induced cells (t1/2 = 2.9 min) than in uninduced cells (t1/2 = 6.9 min). The rates for ligand movement back out to the cell surface and its subsequent release into the medium in both uninduced and induced cells are quite similar."
https://openalex.org/W1593505022,"Abstract The enzyme rhodanese in the form without transferred sulfur, (E), was inactivated by carboxymethylation with iodoacetic acid (E.IAA), and its conformation was compared with that of E inactivated by oxidative processes (Eox). Formation of E.IAA led to the exposure of binding sites for the fluorescent apolar probe 1,1'-bi(4-anilino)naphthalene-5,5'-disulfonic acid (BisANS). The dissociation constant for BisANS decreased as the concentration of E.IAA decreased and ranged from approximately 200 microM at 1 mg/ml protein to approximately 2 microM at protein concentrations below 0.1 mg/ml. Centrifugation confirmed that E.IAA, but not the underivatized enzyme, could associate. E.IAA was proteolyzable by chymotrypsin or endoproteinase Glu C (V8), while rhodanese containing bound sulfur, ES, was totally refractory, and E was only clipped to a small extent. This constellation of consequences was only previously observed with oxidatively inactivated rhodanese. Fluorescence depolarization measurements of bound BisANS were consistent with exposure of apolar surfaces and association of the protein. The fluorescence spectra of BisANS bound to E.IAA or Eox were identical and distinct from the spectrum of BisANS bound to phenylglyoxal-inactivated ES. Digestion with chymotrypsin was followed using protein and BisANS fluorescence and showed a similar response for E.IAA and Eox. These results indicate that the consequences of forming Eox and E.IAA are very similar. Thus, reaction of the active site sulfhydryl group apparently triggers a conformational change leading to increased protein flexibility and increased exposure of hydrophobic surfaces. In the case of oxidation, the trigger might involve initial formation of an active site sulfenic acid which ultimately gives higher oxidation states that could include disulfides."

Packaging of DNA smaller or larger than this range produced uninfectious defective particles. Although these particles contained circular single-stranded DNA, they suffered structural changes which altered the sedimentation properties or the ability to adsorb to the cells. Mutant phage were found from the packaging reaction of DNA larger than 101% of phi X174 DNA. These mutants deleted the termination region of DNA, suggesting that they were produced by early termination of the phage synthesizing reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1509304086,"We have cloned human beta-globin DNA sequences from a genomic library prepared from DNA isolated from the human leukemia cell line K562 and have used the retroviral vector pZip-NeoSV(X)1 to introduce a 3.0-kilobase segment encompassing the globin gene into mouse erythroleukemia cells. Whereas the endogenous K562 beta-globin gene is repressed in K562 cells, when introduced into mouse erythroleukemia cells by retroviral-mediated gene transfer, the beta-globin gene from K562 cells was transcribed and induced 5-20-fold after treatment of the cells with dimethyl sulfoxide. The transcripts were correctly initiated, and expression and regulation of the K562 gene were identical to the expression of a normal human beta-globin gene transferred into mouse erythroleukemia cells in the same way. We have also introduced the normal human beta-globin gene into K562 cells using the same retrovirus vector. SP6 analysis of the RNA isolated from the transduced cells showed that the normal beta-globin gene was transcribed at a moderately high level, before or after treatment with hemin. Based on these data, we suggest that the lack of expression of the endogenous beta-globin gene in K562 cells does not result from an alteration in the gene itself and may not result from a lack of factor(s) necessary for beta-globin gene transcription. Retroviral-mediated transfer of the human beta-globin gene may, however, uniquely influence expression of the gene in K562 cells."
