https://openalex.org/W1977786326,"The hundredfold speedup in glacier motion in a surge of the kind the kind that took place in Variegated Glacier in 1982-1983 is caused by the buildup of high water pressure in the basal passageway system, which is made possible by a fundamental and pervasive change in the geometry and water-transport characteristics of this system. The behavior of the glacier in surge has many remarkable features, which can provide clues to a detailed theory of the surging process. The surge mechanism is akin to a proposed mechanism of overthrust faulting."
https://openalex.org/W2031479544,Fluid inclusions in uranium series-dated calcitic veins from the southern Great Basin record a reduction of 40 per mil in the deuterium content of ground-water recharge during the Pleistocene. This variation is tentatively attributed to major uplift of the Sierra Nevada Range and the Transverse Ranges during this epoch with attendant increasing orographic depletion of deuterium from inland-bound Pacific storms.
https://openalex.org/W2025353712,"The primitive and vesselless angiosperm Zygogynum (Winteraceae), which is restricted to New Caledonia, is pollinated by a moth, Sabatinca (Micropterigidae). Fossil records of both the moth and the plant families extend to the Early Cretaceous. Adult Sabatinca have grinding mandibles and usually feed on the spores of ferns and on pollen. The insects use the flowers as mating sites and eat the pollen which is immersed in a dense pollenkitt. This mode of pollination in which flowers serve as mating and feeding stations with floral odors acting as cues may have been common in the early evolution of flowering plants."

The counter is activated by each R-wave of the electrocardiographic complex obtained from newly designed precordial electrodes. Heart beats can be counted for as long as 24 hours."

The sample is close in composition to the most basic microtektites. Spherical inclusions of nickel-iron, flattened where they protrude, are found to be enriched in sulfur and phosphorus, at least at the surface. The inclusions form approximately 1 percent of the volume."
