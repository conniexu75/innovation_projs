https://openalex.org/W1757602702,"Bone remodeling depends on the precise coordination of bone resorption and subsequent bone formation. Disturbances of this process are associated with skeletal diseases, such as Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED). We show using in vitro and in vivo models that active TGF-beta1 released during bone resorption coordinates bone formation by inducing migration of bone marrow stromal cells, also known as bone mesenchymal stem cells, to the bone resorptive sites and that this process is mediated through a SMAD signaling pathway. Analyzing mice carrying a CED-derived mutant TGFB1 (encoding TGF-beta1), which show the typical progressive diaphyseal dysplasia seen in the human disease, we found high levels of active TGF-beta1 in the bone marrow. Treatment with a TGF-beta type I receptor inhibitor partially rescued the uncoupled bone remodeling and prevented the fractures. Thus, as TGF-beta1 functions to couple bone resorption and formation, modulation of TGF-beta1 activity could be an effective treatment for bone remodeling diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2066122607,"Breast cancer cell lines have been used widely to investigate breast cancer pathobiology and new therapies. Breast cancer is a molecularly heterogeneous disease, and it is important to understand how well and which cell lines best model that diversity. In particular, microarray studies have identified molecular subtypes-luminal A, luminal B, ERBB2-associated, basal-like and normal-like-with characteristic gene-expression patterns and underlying DNA copy number alterations (CNAs). Here, we studied a collection of breast cancer cell lines to catalog molecular profiles and to assess their relation to breast cancer subtypes.Whole-genome DNA microarrays were used to profile gene expression and CNAs in a collection of 52 widely-used breast cancer cell lines, and comparisons were made to existing profiles of primary breast tumors. Hierarchical clustering was used to identify gene-expression subtypes, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to discover biological features of those subtypes. Genomic and transcriptional profiles were integrated to discover within high-amplitude CNAs candidate cancer genes with coordinately altered gene copy number and expression.Transcriptional profiling of breast cancer cell lines identified one luminal and two basal-like (A and B) subtypes. Luminal lines displayed an estrogen receptor (ER) signature and resembled luminal-A/B tumors, basal-A lines were associated with ETS-pathway and BRCA1 signatures and resembled basal-like tumors, and basal-B lines displayed mesenchymal and stem/progenitor-cell characteristics. Compared to tumors, cell lines exhibited similar patterns of CNA, but an overall higher complexity of CNA (genetically simple luminal-A tumors were not represented), and only partial conservation of subtype-specific CNAs. We identified 80 high-level DNA amplifications and 13 multi-copy deletions, and the resident genes with concomitantly altered gene-expression, highlighting known and novel candidate breast cancer genes.Overall, breast cancer cell lines were genetically more complex than tumors, but retained expression patterns with relevance to the luminal-basal subtype distinction. The compendium of molecular profiles defines cell lines suitable for investigations of subtype-specific pathobiology, cancer stem cell biology, biomarkers and therapies, and provides a resource for discovery of new breast cancer genes."
https://openalex.org/W2007438323,"Ewing's sarcoma family tumors are dependent on an oncogenic fusion protein, most commonly EWS-FLI1, which interacts with RNA helicase A (RHA) in transcriptional complexes. Erkizan et al. have identified a small molecule that inhibits the interaction of RHA with EWS-FLI1 and impairs the growth of Ewing's sarcoma xenografts in mice. The findings provide evidence that targeting tumor-specific transcription factors may be a feasible approach to treating cancer. Many sarcomas and leukemias carry nonrandom chromosomal translocations encoding tumor-specific mutant fusion transcription factors that are essential to their molecular pathogenesis. Ewing's sarcoma family tumors (ESFTs) contain a characteristic t(11;22) translocation leading to expression of the oncogenic fusion protein EWS-FLI1. EWS-FLI1 is a disordered protein that precludes standard structure-based small-molecule inhibitor design. EWS-FLI1 binding to RNA helicase A (RHA) is important for its oncogenic function. We therefore used surface plasmon resonance screening to identify compounds that bind EWS-FLI1 and might block its interaction with RHA. YK-4-279, a derivative of the lead compound from the screen, blocks RHA binding to EWS-FLI1, induces apoptosis in ESFT cells and reduces the growth of ESFT orthotopic xenografts. These findings provide proof of principle that inhibiting the interaction of mutant cancer-specific transcription factors with the normal cellular binding partners required for their oncogenic activity provides a promising strategy for the development of uniquely effective, tumor-specific anticancer agents."
https://openalex.org/W1997201294,"Memory T cells promote allograft rejection particularly in co-stimulation blockade-based immunosuppressive regimens. Here we show that the CD2-specific fusion protein alefacept (lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3-Ig; LFA -3-Ig) selectively eliminates memory T cells and, when combined with a co-stimulation blockade-based regimen using cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4)-Ig, a CD80- and CD86-specific fusion protein, prevents renal allograft rejection and alloantibody formation in nonhuman primates. These results support the immediate translation of a regimen for the prevention of allograft rejection without the use of calcineurin inhibitors, steroids or pan-T cell depletion."
https://openalex.org/W2136808514,"Adipose tissue is a dynamic endocrine organ with a central role in metabolism regulation. Functional differences in adipose tissue seem associated with the regional distribution of fat depots, in particular in subcutaneous and visceral omental pads. Here, we report for the first time the isolation of human adipose-derived adult stem cells from visceral omental and subcutaneous fat (V-ASCs and S-ASCs, respectively) from the same subject. Immunophenotyping shows that plastic culturing selects homogeneous cell populations of V-ASCs and S-ASCs from the corresponding stromal vascular fractions (SVFs), sharing typical markers of mesenchymal stem cells. Electron microscopy and electrophysiological and real-time RT-PCR analyses confirm the mesenchymal stem nature of both V-ASCs and S-ASCs, while no significant differences in a limited pattern of cytokine/chemokine expression can be detected. Similar to S-ASCs, V-ASCs can differentiate in vitro toward adipogenic, osteogenic, chondrogenic, muscular, and neuronal lineages, as demonstrated by histochemical, immunofluorescence, real-time RT-PCR, and electrophysiological analyses, suggesting the multipotency of such adult stem cells. Our data demonstrate that both visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues are a source of pluripotent stem cells with multigermline potential. However, the visceral rather than the subcutaneous ASC could represent a more appropriate in vitro cell model for investigating the molecular mechanisms implicated in the pathophysiology of metabolic disorders such as obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2004381525,"Consciousness has been proposed to emerge from functionally integrated large-scale ensembles of gamma-synchronous neural populations that form and dissolve at a frequency in the theta band. We propose that discrete moments of perceptual experience are implemented by transient gamma-band synchronization of relevant cortical regions, and that disintegration and reintegration of these assemblies is time-locked to ongoing theta oscillations. In support of this hypothesis we provide evidence that (1) perceptual switching during binocular rivalry is time-locked to gamma-band synchronizations which recur at a theta rate, indicating that the onset of new conscious percepts coincides with the emergence of a new gamma-synchronous assembly that is locked to an ongoing theta rhythm; (2) localization of the generators of these gamma rhythms reveals recurrent prefrontal and parietal sources; (3) theta modulation of gamma-band synchronization is observed between and within the activated brain regions. These results suggest that ongoing theta-modulated-gamma mechanisms periodically reintegrate a large-scale prefrontal-parietal network critical for perceptual experience. Moreover, activation and network inclusion of inferior temporal cortex and motor cortex uniquely occurs on the cycle immediately preceding responses signaling perceptual switching. This suggests that the essential prefrontal-parietal oscillatory network is expanded to include additional cortical regions relevant to tasks and perceptions furnishing consciousness at that moment, in this case image processing and response initiation, and that these activations occur within a time frame consistent with the notion that conscious processes directly affect behaviour."

The ERBB-2 tyrosine kinase receptor is frequently overexpressed in prostate cancer and is associated with disease progression and poor survival. We have identified two specific miR-331-3p target sites within the ERBB-2 mRNA 3′-untranslated region and show that miR-331-3p expression is decreased in prostate cancer tissue relative to normal adjacent prostate tissue. Transfection of multiple prostate cancer cell lines with miR-331-3p reduced ERBB-2 mRNA and protein expression and blocked downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling. Furthermore, miR-331-3p transfection blocked the androgen receptor signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells, reducing activity of an androgen-stimulated prostate-specific antigen promoter and blocking prostate-specific antigen expression. Our findings provide insight into the regulation of ERBB-2 expression in cancer and suggest that miR-331-3p has the capacity to regulate signaling pathways critical to the development and progression of prostate cancer cells.

In 2007, 218,890 new cases and 27,050 prostate cancer-related deaths had occurred in the United States (1Jemal A. Siegel R. Ward E. Murray T. Xu J. Thun M.J. CA Cancer J. Clin. 2007; 57: 43-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (7468) Google Scholar). Initially, prostate tumors express the androgen receptor (AR) and are dependent on androgens for their growth, providing the basis of androgen ablation therapy; however, some of these tumors will eventually recur in an androgen-independent form, with a significantly worse prognosis. There are no effective therapies for androgen-independent prostate cancer. Overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB-2/HER2) and activation of its downstream signaling cascades, including the PI3K/AKT pathway, which promotes cell proliferation, metastasis, apoptosis resistance, and angiogenesis, has been identified in a range of tumors, including those of the breast, prostate, and pancreas (2Vernimmen D. Gueders M. Pisvin S. Delvenne P. Winkler R. Br. J. Cancer. 2003; 89: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Studies in patients with localized PCa have shown that ERBB-2 expression is significantly associated with disease progression, metastasis, and survival (3Isharwal S. Miller M.C. Epstein J.I.

In addition, it is thought that elevated ERBB-2 expression and AKT signaling facilitates the development of androgen-independent PCa by activating AR signaling in the absence of androgen (4Craft N.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short, endogenous, non-coding RNA molecules that bind with imperfect complementarity to the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of target mRNAs, causing translational repression or message degradation (8Bartel D.P.

These include miR-125b, which regulates expression of the pro-apoptotic factor Bak1 and promotes androgen-independent growth (26Shi X.B. Tepper C.G. White R.W. J. Cell. Mol.

Med. 2008; 12: 1456-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To date it has been unclear whether miRNAs regulate ERBB-2 expression in PCa. In this study, we show that miR-331-3p directly regulates ERBB-2 mRNA and protein expression in multiple PCa cell lines via two specific ERBB-2 3′-UTR target binding sites. We found that miR-331-3p expression is down-regulated in ERBB-2-overexpressing PCa tissue relative to normal adjacent prostate tissue, and that miR-331-3p reduces downstream ERBB-2 signaling via phosphorylated AKT in PCa cells. Furthermore, miR-331-3p blocked the AR signaling pathway by reducing transcriptional activity and expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), an AR target gene. Our data show a new mechanism by which reduced miR-331-3p expression in PCa promotes elevated ERBB-2 expression and signaling; through cross-talk this facilitates AR signaling and has implications for the development, progression, and treatment of PCa. LNCaP-FGC, CWR-22RV1, and DU145 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For ligand treatments, cells were starved overnight in 1% charcoal-stripped serum and stimulated with heregulin (β-subunit, Sigma; 50 ng/ml for 20 min), or DHT and/or bicalutamide at 10 nm and 10 μm, respectively, for 24 h. Synthetic miRNA precursor molecules corresponding to human miR-331-3p (precursor miR miRNA product ID PM10881) and a negative control miRNA (miR-NC; precursor miR miRNA negative control number 1, product ID AM17110) were obtained from Ambion. Synthetic LNA precursor molecules corresponding to hsa-miR-331-3p (miRCURY knockdown number 138573-00) and a negative control scramble-LNA (miRCURY knockdown number 199002-00) were obtained from Exiqon. Total RNA from normal adjacent tissue (NAT) and prostate tumor were purchased from Ambion (FirstChoice; product ID AM7288, acinar adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, stage II, T2N0M0, Gleason score 6 (3 + 3)). pmiR-REPORT-miR-331- 3p-target was generated by ligating annealed DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to a perfect hsa-miR-331-3p target site (forward, 5′-CAA CAA AAT CAC TAG TCT TCC A-3′ and reverse, 5′-TGG AAG ACT AGT GAT TTT GTT G-3′) to unique SpeI and HindIII sites that were inserted 3′ of the luciferase open reading frame of pmiR- REPORT (Promega) firefly luciferase reporter vector. Full-length ERBB-2 3′-UTR reporter plasmid was generated by cloning the PCR-amplified, full-length ERBB-2 3′- UTR (nucleotides 4006–4624 of GenBankTM accession number NM_004448) into the pmiR-REPORT luciferase plasmid backbone (Ambion). Wild type and mutant ERBB-2 target reporter plasmids pmiR-REPORT-ERBB-2-A and -B were generated by cloning annealed oligonucleotides corresponding to nucleotides 4093–4115 and 4513–4535, respectively, of ERBB-2 (GenBank accession number NM_004448) mRNA 3′-UTR into SpeI and HindIII sites in pmiR- REPORT. Mutant vectors contained mutations in the miR-331-3p seed binding regions. Oligonucleotide sequences were: target A wild type, 5′-ACT AGT GCC CTC CGA CCA CTT CCA GGG GAA AGC TT; target A mutant, 5′-ACT AGT GCC CTC CGA CCA CTT CGA CGC GAA AGC TT; target B wild type, 5′-ACT AGT AGA TGA AAT AAA GAC CCA GGG GGA AGC TT; and target B mutant, 5′-ACT AGT AGA TGA AAT AAA GAG CGA CGC GGA AGC TT. Mutated bases are underlined. All plasmid DNA sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. Cells were seeded 24 h prior to transfection and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with miRNA precursor molecules at final concentrations ranging from 1 to 30 nm. Cells were harvested at 12–24 h (for RNA extraction) or 3 days (for protein extraction). For reporter gene assays, cells were seeded in 24-well plates and co-transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 100 ng of firefly luciferase reporter DNA and either 20 ng of pRL-CMV or 100 ng of pRL-thymidine kinase Renilla luciferase reporter DNA as a transfection control. Cell lysates were assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities 24 h after transfection using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and a Fluostar OPTIMA luminometer (BMG Labtech), and firefly luciferase activities normalized to Renilla luciferase activities. Total RNA was extracted from cell lines with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I (Promega) to eliminate contaminating genomic DNA. For qRT-PCR analysis of ERBB-2, GAPDH, and pri-miR-331-3p expression, 125 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA with random hexamers and Thermoscript (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR for ERBB-2, GAPDH, and pri-miR-331-3p was performed using a Corbett 3000 RotorGene instrument (Corbett Research) with Platinum® SYBR® Green (Invitrogen) and ERBB-2 and GAPDH primers from Primer Bank (29Wang X.

However, both miR-331-3p sites had some degree of sequence conservation between human, mouse, rat, and dog (Fig. 1B). Although there were three other miRNAs with two predicted putative binding sites in the ERBB-2 mRNA 3′-UTR (miR-1197, miR-1207-5p, and miR-1252) the TargetScan context score for each site was significantly lower than for both of the miR-331-3p sites (70 and 27, 42 and 54, and 35 and 41%, respectively). Given our interest in ERBB-2 expression and signaling in PCa, we investigated the potential for miR-331-3p to regulate ERBB-2 expression in three different PCa cell lines (LNCaP, AR+; 22RV1, AR+; and DU145, AR). We found low miR-331-3p expression across the cell lines, with the highest levels in DU145 cells and lower levels in the two AR+ cell lines (supplemental Fig. S1A). ERBB-2 mRNA expression was inversely correlated with miR-331-3p expression, as DU145 cells express the least, whereas LNCaP and 22RV1 cells contain higher levels of ERBB-2 mRNA (supplemental Fig. S1B). To evaluate the effects of miR-331-3p on each of these cell lines, we transfected either a negative control or miR-331-3p precursor into the cells and determined the level of ERBB-2 gene expression at 72 h post-transfection. Compared with a negative control miRNA precursor, miR-331-3p significantly down-regulated expression of both ERBB-2 protein and RNA in each of the PCa cell lines, independent of AR status (Fig. 2, A and B). We next examined the expression of miR-331-3p in PCa versus normal adjacent tissue. The expression of miR-331-3p was substantially lower in the tumor tissue compared with normal prostate, for both miR-331-3p, as well as the pri-miR-331-3p transcript (Fig. 3, A and B). We also noted elevated ERBB-2 expression in the same tumor sample relative to normal adjacent tissue (Fig. 3C), suggesting a reciprocal relationship between the levels of miR-331-3p and ERBB-2 in human PCa. TargetScan analysis suggested that the 3′-UTR of ERBB-2 would be a direct target for miR-331-3p, via one or both predicted binding sites. To test this hypothesis, we generated miR-331-3p perfect target and ERBB-2 3′-UTR reporter constructs (Fig. 4A). PCa cells (22RV1) were transfected with either a negative control miRNA (miR-NC) or miR-331-3p precursor to up-regulate miR-331-3p expression, or a negative control or miR-331-3p antagonist (locked nucleic acid-modified oligonucleotide, LNA-anti-miR) to block miR-331-3p activity. In 22RV1 cells co-transfected with miR-331-3p precursor and a perfect miR-331-3p target site reporter, there was a significant reduction in reporter activity, compared with cells with the miR-NC precursor (Fig. 4A). Similarly, with the full-length ERBB-2 3′-UTR, the miR-331-3p precursor induced a significant decrease in reporter activity. In contrast, cells transfected with LNA-miR-331-3p showed an increase in reporter activity, which was not evident in LNA NC-transfected cells (Fig. 4A). We next determined the contribution of each of the two miR-331-3p sites to the regulation of reporter activity. Using the miR-331-3p perfect target reporter, and wild type ERBB-2 3′-UTR site A and B reporter constructs, we found that there was a similar contribution to reporter activity from both sites with miR-331-3p transfection, when compared with transfection with an unrelated miRNA (supplemental Fig. S2). Furthermore, smaller 3′-UTR ERBB-2 constructs were tested (see Fig. 4B). In 22RV1 cells transfected with mutant A and B site reporters, the effect of miR-331-3p was eliminated, consistent with miR-331-3p binding directly to each of the two target sites (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these data confirm that each of the two miR-331-3p target sites in the ERBB-2 3′-UTR is a direct and specific target for miR-331-3p, and that both sites contribute to the regulation of ERBB-2 expression by miR-331-3p. These effects are observed in a range of human PCa cell lines, independent of AR status. To evaluate the effects of miR-331-3p on PCa cell signaling, we initially treated 22RV1, DU145, and LNCaP cells with heregulin to confirm activation of the ERBB-2 pathway. In 22RV1, DU145, and LNCaP cells treated with heregulin for 20 min, transfection with the miR-331-3p precursor significantly reduced the level of phosphorylated ERBB-2 (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). Furthermore, we examined the effects of miR-331-3p on phosphorylated AKT levels in prostate cancer cells to determine whether miR-331-3p could regulate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway downstream of ERBB-2. Cells transfected with miR-331-3p had substantially lower phosphorylated AKT levels, consistent with miR-331-3p regulating the PI3K/AKT kinase pathway. It has been proposed that elevated levels of ERBB-2 expression and PI3K/AKT signaling promote the progression of prostate cancer by activating the AR signaling pathway. Cross-talk between the ERBB-2 and AR pathways can activate transcription of AR pathway genes, even in the absence of androgen stimulation (4Craft N. Shostak Y. Carey M. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 6Mellinghoff I.K. Vivanco I. Kwon A. Tran C. Wongvipat J. Sawyers C.L. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 517-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To investigate whether miR-331-3p modifies AR signaling via its blockade of ERBB-2 signaling, we transfected LNCaP cells with miR-331-3p or the miR-NC precursor and, after 24 h, stimulated the cells with DHT, with or without bicalutamide, an AR antagonist. As expected, DHT induced PSA protein expression and this effect was blocked by either bicalutamide or miR-331-3p treatment (Fig. 5B), suggesting that miR-331-3p represses AR signaling indirectly by regulating ERBB-2 expression and signaling, because miR-331-3p did not regulate AR expression directly (Fig. 5A), and the AR mRNA 3′-UTR does not contain the predicted miR-331-3p target sites (data not shown). To define the mechanism by which miR-331-3p blocks AR signaling, we co-transfected LNCaP cells with a DHT-responsive PSA-LUC reporter construct and either miR-331-3p or miR-NC (Fig. 5C). Reporter activity was increased following DHT treatment, and this effect was significantly reduced by miR-331-3p transfection. Furthermore, the combination of miR-331-3p and bicalutamide was more effective at reducing DHT-induced PSA-LUC reporter activity than either treatment alone. Taken together, these data suggest that by regulating ERBB-2 expression and PI3K/AKT signaling, miR-331-3p can regulate AR signaling in PCa. miR-331-3p blocked DHT-induced PSA expression and PSA-LUC reporter gene activity in LNCaP cells but it did not alter AR expression, suggesting that miR-331-3p indirectly reduces transcription and expression of AR pathway target genes such as PSA via cross-talk between ERBB-2 and AR signaling pathways. We have demonstrated that the ERBB-2 mRNA 3′-UTR contains two specific, direct miR-331-3p target sites, and that miR-331-3p down-regulates ERBB-2 mRNA and protein expression and signaling in multiple PCa cell lines. The observed reduction in ERBB-2 mRNA levels by miR-331-3p is consistent with recent reports indicating that many miRNAs regulate target gene expression by promoting mRNA decay (35Filipowicz W. Jaskiewicz L. Kolb F.A. Pillai R.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 36Liu T. Papagiannakopoulos T. Puskar K. Qi S. Santiago F. Clay W. Lao K. Lee Y. Nelson S.F. Kornblum H.I. Doyle F. Petzold L. Shraiman B. Kosik K.S. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e804Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). miR-331-3p expression is decreased in ERBB-2 overexpressing PCa tissue relative to normal adjacent tissue, suggesting a role for miR-331-3p in the development and progression of this disease. Furthermore, we have shown that miR-331-3p blocked AR signaling in PCa cells, without reducing AR expression, by decreasing androgen-induced PSA promoter activity and PSA protein expression. These data suggest that loss of miR-331-3p expression could promote the increased ERBB-2 expression and signaling seen in many prostate cancers, and that this may promote the AR signaling pathway. Although ERBB-2 gene amplification is common in ERBB-2 overexpressing breast tumors, it is a very rare event in PCa (37Solit D.B. Rosen N. J. Clin. Oncol. 2007; 25: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting that post-transcriptional mechanisms, such as regulation by miRNAs, may determine its expression in this disease. Recent evidence suggests that expression of the ERBB receptor family in cancer cells can be mediated in part by miRNAs (28Scott G.K. Goga A. Bhaumik D. Berger C.E. Sullivan C.S. Benz C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1479-1486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 38Kefas B. Godlewski J. Comeau L. Li Y. Abounader R. Hawkinson M. Lee J. Fine H. Chiocca E.A. Lawler S.

There is poor conservation of the two ERBB-2 3′-UTR miR-331-3p target sites (Fig. 1B, A and B) between human and rodent. However, TargetScan analysis (33Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9881) Google Scholar) indicates that these sites are among the highest ranking predicted miR-331-3p target sites, with context score percentiles of 97 and 88%, respectively, when taking into account criteria that are associated with miRNA target site functionality, such as 3′ compensatory base pairing, local AU sequence content, and position within the 3′-UTR (34Grimson A. Farh K.K. Johnston W.K. Garrett-Engele P. Lim L.P. Bartel D.P. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 91-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3040) Google Scholar). Our reporter gene assays indicate that target sites A and B contribute to the direct repression of ERBB-2 expression by miR-331-3p despite their weak evolutionary conservation. This is consistent with our previous findings with miR-7 and the epidermal growth factor receptor, where miR-7 targets two poorly conserved sites within the epidermal growth factor receptor 3′-UTR to regulate epidermal growth factor receptor expression and signaling (39Webster R.J. Giles K.M. Price K.J. Zhang P.M. Mattick J.S. Leedman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5731-5741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), emphasizing that strong miRNA target site conservation between species is not essential for a site to be functional. Importantly, mutation of each ERBB-2 3′-UTR miR-331-3p target site seed binding region impaired repression of reporter gene activity by miR-331-3p, whereas in contrast, transfection with unrelated miRNA did not repress reporter activity. This confirmed the direct and specific interaction of miR-331-3p with each ERBB-2 mRNA 3′-UTR site. Anti-androgen therapy (bicalutamide (CasodexTM)) is widely used for locally advanced PCa; however, after an initial response to treatment some tumors recur in an androgen-independent form. The molecular mechanisms underlying androgen independence are not fully understood, however, elevated ERBB-2 expression and signaling is thought to promote the progression of PCa from an androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent state by producing constitutive activation of AR signaling despite androgen withdrawal or blockade (4Craft N. Shostak Y. Carey M. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 6Mellinghoff I.K. Vivanco I. Kwon A. Tran C. Wongvipat J. Sawyers C.L. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 517-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This may be achieved by enhanced recruitment of the AR to androgen-responsive promoters (40Liu Y. Majumder S. McCall W. Sartor C.I. Mohler J.L. Gregory C.W. Earp H.S. Whang Y.E. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3404-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, ERBB-2 has emerged as a therapeutic target in PCa, with preclinical and clinical studies investigating the efficacy of anti-ERBB-2 monoclonal antibodies (e.g. trastuzumab or pertuzumab) for the treatment of the disease (41Bradbury J. Lancet Oncol. 2007; 8: 287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 42Albanell J. Codony J. Rovira A. Mellado B. Gascón P. Adv. Exp. Med.

Oncol. 2001; 28: 71-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Bianco A.R. J. Chemother. 2004; 16: 52-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have yielded disappointing results with little or no anti-tumor activity observed. However, these trials have involved patients with advanced PCa and patients have not been stratified or recruited according to tumor ERBB-2 expression, suggesting that better selection may be required in future studies (37Solit D.B. Rosen N. J. Clin. Oncol. 2007; 25: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is possible that blocking ERBB-2 signaling will hinder the progression of PCa to androgen independence, or that ERBB-2 blockade will restore androgen dependence, suggesting that co-administration of an ERBB-2 inhibitor with an anti-androgen (e.g. bicalutamide) might have clinical benefits (45Gravina G.L. Festuccia C. Millimaggi D. Tombolini V. Dolo V. Vicentini C. Bologna M. Urology. 2009; 74: 452-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Our transfection studies are consistent with this hypothesis, with the combination of miR-331-3p and bicalutamide giving stronger repression of androgen-stimulated PSA promoter activity than either miR-331-3p or bicalutamide alone (Figs. 5C and 6). It has also been suggested that resistance to second line therapies, including ERBB-2 inhibitors, may result from loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN and subsequent activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, a common event in advanced PCa that is associated with androgen independence (46Malik S.N. Brattain M. Ghosh P.M. Troyer D.A. Prihoda T. Bedolla R. Kreisberg J.I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 1168-1171PubMed Google Scholar, 47Murillo H. Huang H. Schmidt L.J. Smith D.I. Tindall D.J.

Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5246-5250Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Indeed, PTEN loss is associated with trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer (49Nagata Y. Lan K.H. Zhou X. Tan M. Esteva F.J. Sahin A.A. Klos K.S. Li P. Monia B.P. Nguyen N.T. Hortobagyi G.N. Hung M.C. Yu D. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 117-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). Furthermore, bicalutamide monotherapy is associated with increased expression of ERBB-2 and phosphorylated AKT and reduced expression of PTEN in PCa (5Festuccia C. Gravina G.L. Muzi P. Pomante R. Ventura L. Vessella R.L. Vicentini C. Bologna M. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2007; 14: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our work suggests that miR-331-3p has the capacity to block PI3K/AKT signaling in PCa cells independent of their PTEN status (LNCaP, PTEN-negative; 22Rv1 and DU145, PTEN-positive) (50Festuccia C. Gravina G.L. D'Alessandro A.M. Millimaggi D. Di Rocco C. Dolo V. Ricevuto E. Vicentini C. Bologna M. Int. J. Oncol. 2008; 33: 381-388PubMed Google Scholar), possibly by targeting other molecules involved in this pathway downstream of PTEN, and thus miR-331-3p could be used to overcome the inherent resistance of PTEN-negative prostate cancers to anti-ERBB-2 and other second line therapies (e.g. chemotherapy). Our study is the first to implicate miR-331-3p in PCa. Deregulated expression of miRNAs in cancer is often associated with gain or loss of chromosomal regions, with many miRNA genes located in fragile sites that are frequently altered in cancer (51Calin G.A.

Alternatively, aberrant miRNA expression can occur through epigenetic mechanisms or by defects in miRNA biogenesis (14Bueno M.J. Pérez de Castro I. Gómez de Cedrón M. Santos J. Calin G.A.

We observed decreased expression of both primary and mature miR-331-3p in PCa tissue relative to normal adjacent prostate tissue (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that reduced miR-331-3p expression in PCa cells does not result from abnormal processing of miR-331-3p. The human miR-331 gene is located at 12q22, a chromosomal region that is not commonly altered in PCa. One possible explanation for decreased miR-331-3p expression in PCa is that there is reduced miR-331-3p gene transcription, resulting in less primary, and therefore mature, miR-331-3p being produced. Other studies have reported altered transcription of miRNA genes in cancer (17Chang T.C. Yu D. Lee Y.S. Wentzel E.A. Arking D.E. West K.M. Dang C.V. Thomas-Tikhonenko A. Mendell J.T. Nat.

In this regard, it will be interesting to characterize the miR-331-3p promoter and its activity in PCa cells. In summary, we have identified ERBB-2 as a direct and specific target of miR-331-3p in PCa cells. miR-331-3p expression is reduced in PCa and promotes elevated ERBB-2 expression and signaling, which increases AR signaling. Transfection of PCa cell lines with miR-331-3p reduced ERBB-2 expression, PI3K/AKT signaling, and blocked AR signaling. This suggests that miR-331-3p has the capacity to regulate activity of critical signaling pathways in PCa cells. Ongoing studies will investigate the potential for miR-331-3p to mediate cross-talk between the AR and ERBB-2 signaling pathways and modulate the sensitivity of PCa cells to anti-androgen and anti-ERBB-2 therapies.

https://openalex.org/W2151237264,"Electronic tags were used to examine the seasonal movements, aggregations and diving behaviors of Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) to better understand their migration ecology and oceanic habitat utilization. Implantable archival tags (n = 561) were deployed in bluefin tuna from 1996 to 2005 and 106 tags were recovered. Movement paths of the fish were reconstructed using light level and sea-surface-temperature-based geolocation estimates. To quantify habitat utilization we employed a weighted kernel estimation technique that removed the biases of deployment location and track length. Throughout the North Atlantic, high residence times (167±33 days) were identified in four spatially confined regions on a seasonal scale. Within each region, bluefin tuna experienced distinct temperature regimes and displayed different diving behaviors. The mean diving depths within the high-use areas were significantly shallower and the dive frequency and the variance in internal temperature significantly higher than during transit movements between the high-use areas. Residence time in the more northern latitude high-use areas was significantly correlated with levels of primary productivity. The regions of aggregation are associated with areas of abundant prey and potentially represent critical foraging habitats that have seasonally abundant prey. Throughout the North Atlantic mean diving depth was significantly correlated with the depth of the thermocline, and dive behavior changed in relation to the stratification of the water column. In this study, with numerous multi-year tracks, there appear to be repeatable patterns of clear aggregation areas that potentially are changing with environmental conditions. The high concentrations of bluefin tuna in predictable locations indicate that Atlantic bluefin tuna are vulnerable to concentrated fishing efforts in the regions of foraging aggregations."

Dis. 1978; 118: 705-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Approximately 10% of surfactant is composed of proteins, including the hydrophilic surfactant proteins A and D (SP-A and SP-D) and the hydrophobic proteins, SP-B and SP-C (13Kuroki Y. McCormack F.X. Ogasawara Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29793-29800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SP-A and SP-D are now recognized to play important roles in innate immunity (14Sano H. Kuroki Y. Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 15Wright J.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), and these proteins directly interact with various microorganisms and pathogen-derived components (16Lawson P.R. Reid K.B. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 66-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Moreover, by associating with cell surface pattern recognition receptors, SP-A and SP-D regulate inflammatory cellular responses such as the release of LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines (14Sano H. Kuroki Y. Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 17Sano H. Sohma H. Muta T. Nomura S. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 387-395PubMed Google Scholar). At least one important function of SP-A and SP-D is to suppress the inflammatory response of the lung to LPS. By weight, ∼90% of surfactant consists of lipids. The major component is phosphatidylcholine (PC) (70–80%), of which nearly 70% is dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). Pulmonary surfactant also contains variable amounts of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (7–18%), phosphatidylinositol (PI) (2–4%), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (2–3%) (18Veldhuizen R. Nag K. Orgeig S. Possmayer F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 90-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). In humans, PG is composed almost exclusively of unsaturated molecular species (19Schmidt R. Meier U. Markart P. Grimminger F. Velcovsky H.G. Morr H. Seeger W. Günther A. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2002; 283: L1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Wright S.M. Hockey P.M. Enhorning G. Strong P. Reid K.B. Holgate S.T. Djukanovic R. Postle A.D. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 1283-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The PG concentration in the extracellular compartment of the human lung is estimated to be as high as 3 mg/ml (21Lewis J.F. Jobe A.H. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 147: 218-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), and this is the only location in mammals that such levels occur. The functions of the minor phospholipid and the neutral lipid components of surfactant are largely unclear and require further study. Previous work has provided some evidence that specific phospholipids can modulate inflammation. Oxidized phospholipid inhibits LPS-induced inflammatory responses in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (22Bochkov V.N. Kadl A. Huber J. Gruber F. Binder B.R. Leitinger N. Nature. 2002; 419: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) inhibits phospholipase A2 secretion via a down-regulation of NF-kB activation in guinea pig macrophages (23Wu Y.Z. Medjane S. Chabot S. Kubrusly F.S. Raw I. Chignard M. Touqui L. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 168: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Wang et al. (24Wang P.Y. Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24309-24313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) expressed CD14 in a macrophage cell line and demonstrated that these cells acquired PI binding activity, which was dependent upon the presence of LBP. The PI binding property correlated with PI-dependent inhibition of cell activation by LPS, and both LPS and PI binding were inhibited by treatment of the cells with anti-CD14 antibodies. Hashimoto et al. (25Hashimoto M. Asai Y. Ogawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44205-44213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) identified an unusual 1-O-alkenyl PG from Treponema species that suppresses LPS-mediated macrophage activation. Unsaturated PGs, caridolipin and PI, were shown in the same study to be as effective as 1-O-alkenyl PG. The action of the acidic phospholipids was LBP-dependent and was concluded to involve both LBP and CD14. Mueller et al. (26Mueller M. Brandenburg K. Dedrick R. Schromm A.B. Seydel U. J. Immunol. 2005; 172: 1091-1096Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) also identified LBP as the major target for the antagonistic action of PG, PI, and cardiolipin upon LPS-mediated activation of macrophages. LPS is a major cause of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (27Atabai K. Matthay M.A. Thorax. 2002; 57: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 28Rubenfeld G.D. Caldwell E. Peabody E. Weaver J. Martin D.P. Neff M. Stern E.J. Hudson L.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 1685-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (2892) Google Scholar). In addition to LPS, some oxidized lipid species, induced by multiple pathogenic and chemical insults to the lungs, can act as LPS mimetics and activate the TLR4 system to induce ALI (29Imai Y. Kuba K. Neely G.G. Yaghubian-Malhami R. Perkmann T. van Loo G. Ermolaeva M. Veldhuizen R. Leung Y.H. Wang H. Liu H. Sun Y. Pasparakis M. Kopf M. Mech C. Bavari S. Peiris J.S. Slutsky A.S. Akira S. Hultqvist M. Holmdahl R. Nicholls J. Jiang C. Binder C.J. Penninger J.M. Cell. 2008; 133: 235-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). ALI/ARDS is a life-threatening condition in which inflammation of the lungs and accumulation of fluid in the alveoli leads to low blood oxygen levels. Over a period of 25 years, the annual incidence of ALI/ARDS is 335,000, with 147,000 deaths per year (28Rubenfeld G.D. Caldwell E. Peabody E. Weaver J. Martin D.P. Neff M. Stern E.J. Hudson L.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 1685-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (2892) Google Scholar). The mortality rate of ALI/ARDS has not significantly changed over the last decade. In the present study, we examined the anti-inflammatory effect of surfactant phospholipids upon LPS-induced inflammation in rodent and human macrophages. The purpose of this investigation was to determine 1) new details about the molecular specificity of anionic lipid antagonism of LPS action, 2) the influence of surfactant components upon the antagonistic actions of anionic lipids in vitro and in vivo, and 3) the direct interactions between the anionic lipids and the CD14, TLR4, and MD-2 components that participate in LPS activation of target cells. Our results provide evidence that anionic surfactant lipids play an important role in regulating pulmonary inflammation in response to LPS by specific interactions with the CD14 and MD-2 components of the TLR4 signaling pathway. The actions of the anionic surfactant lipids as LPS antagonists could have significant potential for treatment of inflammatory lung diseases such as ALI. LPS (0111:B4) purified from Escherichia coli was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The lipids PC, PG, sphingomyelin (SM), PE, phosphatidylserine (PS), and PI were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). TNF-α was from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-p46 JNK, rabbit polyclonal anti-p38, mouse monoclonal phospho-specific p46-p54 JNK antibodies, and rabbit polyclonal anti-mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase (MKP)-1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal phospho-specific p42 ERK, rabbit polyclonal anti-p42 ERK, phospho-specific p38 MAPK, rabbit polyclonal anti-IκBα, and phospho-specific IκBα antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). [3H]Leucine was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Recombinant human CD14 and mouse anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies, biG2 and biG14, were purchased from Cell Sciences Inc. (Canton, MA). Mouse anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody MEM-18 was purchased from Exbio (Vestec, Czech Republic). Mouse anti-His antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-V5 antibody were obtained from Invitrogen. Mouse IgG1 isotype control, mouse monoclonal anti-human CD14 antibody, and sheep anti-human CD14 polyclonal antibody were purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). The macrophage-like cell line U937 (CRL-1593.2) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were maintained in endotoxin-free RPMI 1640 medium from Cambrex (East Rutherford, NJ) with 10% heat-inactivated bovine growth serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Rat alveolar macrophages were isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of Sprague-Dawley rats. The macrophages were plated at 5 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates (Falcon) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% bovine growth serum and allowed to adhere for 2 h prior to treatment with agonists and antagonists. Human alveolar macrophages were isolated from BALF obtained from healthy volunteers using protocols reviewed and approved by the National Jewish Medical Research Center Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the University of Colorado General Clinical Research Center. The macrophages were plated at 5 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates (Falcon) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% bovine growth serum and allowed to adhere for 48 h prior to the addition of agonists and antagonists. U937 cells (1.3 × 105/well in 96-well plates) were induced to differentiate by treatment with 10 nm phorbol myristate acetate for 48 h followed by recovery for 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% bovine growth serum. Rat alveolar macrophages (5 × 105/well in 24-well plates) were incubated for 2 h after isolation. Phospholipids were added to the cultures 30 min before adding LPS. After LPS addition, cultures were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation period, the medium was collected and assayed for TNF-α concentrations using an ELISA kit. For all batches of LPS used in these studies, we verified that the induction of inflammatory mediator production was neutralized by treatment with 10 μg/ml polymyxin B. In additional studies, we also verified that the antagonistic actions of anionic lipids were equally effective against both LPS and synthetic KDO2-lipid A. Surfactant lipids were isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage of Sprague-Dawley rats, 28 days after intratracheal instillation of 25 mg of silica (∼125 mg/kg). Initially, the surfactant was purified by the method of Hawgood et al. (30Hawgood S. Benson B.J. Hamilton Jr., R.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) using NaBr density gradient centrifugation. The purified surfactant was extracted with butanol (31Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3388-3394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and segregated into butanol-soluble and -insoluble material. The butanol-soluble surfactant lipids were recovered by drying under vacuum and resuspending in chloroform. The phospholipid content was determined by the method of Rouser et al. (32Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar), and the mixture was stored at −20 °C. Prior to use, an aliquot of surfactant lipids was initially dried under nitrogen and subsequently hydrated in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl buffer at 37 °C for 1 h. Finally, the surfactant lipids were probe-sonicated in 5–30-s bursts with 1 min of cooling between bursts to make a vesicle preparation for use in experiments. Nitric oxide (NO) accumulation in cell culture supernatants was determined as reported previously (33Ding A.H. Nathan C.F. Stuehr D.J. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2407-2412PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, rat alveolar macrophages were stimulated with LPS (10 ng/ml) or LPS plus phospholipids for 24 h. Culture supernatants (usually 100 μl) were combined with an equal volume of Griess reagent (33Ding A.H. Nathan C.F. Stuehr D.J. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2407-2412PubMed Google Scholar), and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min before the absorbance was quantified at 550 nm. With the use of a standard curve, the nmol of NO produced were determined and normalized to the total cell number in each sample. Human and mouse TNF-α ELISA kits were purchased from Invitrogen. Mouse KC and MIP-2 Quantikine kits were purchased from R&D Systems. Measurements of these cytokines were according to the manufacturers' protocols. Monolayers of unstimulated or stimulated macrophages were lysed on ice with 250 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 137 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (34Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). Insoluble nuclear material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resultant supernatants were collected. Aliquots of 15 μg of lysate protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (35Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The blots were then washed in Tris-Tween-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 137 mm NaCl and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20), blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk for 1 h, and probed according to the method described by Towbin et al. (35Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) with phospho-specific antibodies to p46-p54 JNK, p42/p44 ERK, and p38 MAPK, or IκBα or with a polyclonal MKP-1 or IκBα antibodies in 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin dissolved in Tris-Tween-buffered saline. Bound primary antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences) with the use of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody. To determine loading of proteins between samples, the membranes were probed with rabbit polyclonal p46 JNK, p42/p44 ERK, and p38 MAPK antibodies. Female BALB/c mice from 6 to 8 weeks of age were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Experiments were conducted under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Jewish Medical and Research Center. Liposomes were formed using a LiposofastTM (Avestin; Ottawa, Canada), which produces unilamellar liposomes of 100 nm of diameter, and then mixed with an aqueous solution containing LPS. The mixture of LPS and phospholipids was sprayed into murine trachea using a MicroSprayerTM aerosolizer (PennCentury, Philadelphia, PA) under isoflurane anesthesia. Delivery by MicroSprayerTM has been shown to result in lung deposition fractions of more than 93% in primates (36Flotte T.R. Laube B.L. Chest. 2001; 120 (Suppl. 3): 124S-131SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For collection of BALF, lethally anesthetized mice were lavaged via the trachea with 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen). The volume of collected BALF was measured in each sample, and the number of leukocytes was counted (Coulter Counter; Beckman Coulter). Differential cell counts were determined from at least 300 cells on cytocentrifuged preparations (Cytospin; Shandon Ltd., Runcorn, Cheshire, UK). Slides were stained with modified Wright-Giemsa (Hema; Protocol, Swedesboro, NJ), and the cell populations were differentiated by standard hematologic procedures. Cytokine levels in the BALF or in the supernatants of cultured airway macrophages were measured using ELISA kits. A soluble form of the extracellular domain of TLR4 (sTLR4) consists of the putative extracellular sequence (Met1–Lys631) and a His6 epitope tag at its C-terminal end. sTLR4 and MD-2 cDNAs were described previously (37Hyakushima N. Mitsuzawa H. Nishitani C. Sano H. Kuronuma K. Konishi M. Himi T. Miyake K. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6949-6954Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). sTLR4-His6 was subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). MD-2-V5-His6 that contains the C-terminal fusion V5 epitope tag and His6 epitope tag was generated by using PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). A control protein, yeast PstB2-V5-His6 that contains the C-terminal fusion V5 tag epitope and His6 tag epitope, was generated by using PCR and subcloned into the baculovirus vector pVL1392 (38Wu W.I. Routt S. Bankaitis V.A. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The epitope-tagged cDNA constructs for sTLR4 and MD-2 were subcloned into PVL1392, and in addition to PstB2, they were independently expressed using a baculovirus-insect cell expression system according to the methods described by O'Reilly et al. (39O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992: 109-215Google Scholar). The sTLR4 protein, MD-2 protein, sCD14 protein, and PstB2 protein were purified using an epitope affinity column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and elution with 50–200 mm imidazole, by the method described previously (40Sano H. Chiba H. Iwaki D. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22442-22451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Phospholipids (1.25 nmol) in 20-μl aliquots of ethanol were pipetted onto 96-well half-area plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY), and the solvent was evaporated using a warm air blower. After nonspecific binding was blocked with 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA, and 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (buffer A), various concentrations of human CD14 or MD-2 in 25 μl of buffer A were added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The wells were then washed with 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA (buffer B), and 1 μg/ml anti-human CD14 IgG or anti-His antibody (50 μl/well) in buffer A was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:5000) for 1 h. After washing the wells with buffer B, the peroxidase reaction was finally performed using o-phenylenediamine as a substrate. The binding of CD14 or MD-2 to phospholipids was detected by measuring absorbance at 490 nm. LPS (2 μg) in 20-μl aliquots of ethanol was pipetted onto a 96-well plate, and the solvent was evaporated using a warm air blower. After the nonspecific binding was blocked with buffer A, mixtures of CD14 (1 μg/ml) and phospholipid liposomes (20 μg/ml) in buffer A, which were preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h, were added and further incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The amount of bound CD14 was detected using the method described above. Preparations of sTLR4 (100 ng) in aliquots of 20 μl of buffer B were pipetted onto a 96-well plate, and the solvent was evaporated using a warm air dryer. After the nonspecific binding was blocked with buffer A, mixtures of MD-2 (1 μg/ml) and varying concentrations of phospholipid liposomes in buffer A were added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The amount of bound MD-2 was detected using specific antibodies directed against the V5-epitope of the recombinant protein. All results were expressed as mean ± S.E. Analysis of variance was used to determine the levels of significant difference between all groups. Groups were compared by unpaired two-tailed t test. The p value for significance was set at 0.05. In our initial studies, we investigated the ability of purified lipids normally present as minor components of pulmonary surfactant to modulate LPS-induced cytokine secretion. Macrophages were stimulated with LPS in the presence or absence of purified phospholipids (Fig. 1). Culture supernatants were collected, and TNF-α production by U937 cells and NO production by rat alveolar macrophages were determined. Palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) and PI significantly attenuated TNF-α and NO production in a concentration-dependent manner with the maximal inhibitory effect ≤ 2.5 μg of phospholipids/ml. Another anionic phospholipid, PS, was less effective than PI and POPG. In contrast, the aminophospholipids and sphingolipids DPPC, PE, and SM had no significant effect on TNF-α or NO production. The major molecular species of PG in humans is POPG, whereas rodent surfactant contains a mixture of disaturated and unsaturated PG. We next examined the effect of saturation and acyl chain length of PGs on the inhibition of LPS-induced inflammation. As shown in Fig. 2, disaturated PGs containing two palmitic (16:0), stearic (18:0), or octanoic (8:0) fatty acids failed to antagonize LPS-induced TNF-α or NO production. However, PGs with two myristic (14:0) fatty acids were as potent as POPG as antagonists of LPS. PGs with two lauric (12:0) fatty acids were also modest antagonists of LPS-induced cytokine production. Although we did not have the reagents to compare different molecular species of PI for LPS antagonism, the PIs that we used were unsaturated with the major form containing 16:0 and 18:2 fatty acids. From the above findings, we conclude that unsaturated PGs and PIs and selected saturated PGs act as potent antagonists of LPS action upon macrophages.FIGURE 2The inhibitory effect of phosphatidylglycerols on LPS-induced inflammatory mediator production is molecular species-specific. PG liposomes were formed by bath sonication for 30 min at room temperature. LPS (10 ng/ml) and different concentrations of PG were added to monolayer cultures of differentiated U937 cells (A) or rat alveolar macrophages (B). Media TNF-α measurements were performed 6 h after stimulation. Media NO measurements were performed 24 h after stimulation. LPS stimulation without PG was set at 100%. The molecular species of PG shown on the graph are: 8:0, dioctanoyl-phosphatidylglycerol; 12:0, dilauroyl-phosphatidylglycerol (DLPG); 14:0, DMPG; 16:0, DPPG; 18:0, distearoyl-phosphatidylglycerol; and 16:0/18:1, POPG. The data shown are the means ± S.E. from three separate experiments with duplicate samples in each experiment. The average TNF-α production upon LPS stimulation was 11.3 ± 0.7 ng/ml. The average NO production upon LPS stimulation was 10.1 ± 0.6 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The POPG present in the alveolar compartment is in a lipid-rich environment with concentrations of total phospholipids of 15–30 mg/ml (21Lewis J.F. Jobe A.H. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 147: 218-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), and we examined whether these other lipids can interfere with LPS antagonism. In one set of experiments, POPG was added to organic solvent extracts of surfactant using a method that ensured ideal mixing of all components, and liposomes were prepared by sonication.

https://openalex.org/W2038185658,"Background AQP1 belongs to aquaporins family, water-specific, membrane-channel proteins expressed in diverse tissues. Recent papers showed that during angiogenesis, AQP1 is expressed preferentially by microvessels, favoring angiogenesis via the increase of permeability In particular, in AQP1 null mice, endothelial cell migration is impaired without altering their proliferation or adhesion. Therefore, AQP1 has been proposed as a novel promoter of tumor angiogenesis. Methods/Findings Using targeted silencing of AQP1 gene expression, an impairment in the organization of F-actin and a reduced migration capacity was demonstrated in human endothelial and melanoma cell lines. Interestingly, we showed, for the first time, that AQP1 co-immunoprecipitated with Lin-7. Lin7-GFP experiments confirmed co-immunoprecipitation. In addition, the knock down of AQP1 decreased the level of expression of Lin-7 and β-catenin and the inhibition of proteasome contrasted partially such a decrease. Conclusions/Significance All together, our findings show that AQP1 plays a role inside the cells through Lin-7/β-catenin interaction. Such a role of AQP1 is the same in human melanoma and endothelial cells, suggesting that AQP1 plays a global physiological role. A model is presented."
https://openalex.org/W2062308979,"Background The discovery of genetically distinct hantaviruses in shrews (Order Soricomorpha, Family Soricidae) from widely separated geographic regions challenges the hypothesis that rodents (Order Rodentia, Family Muridae and Cricetidae) are the primordial reservoir hosts of hantaviruses and also predicts that other soricomorphs harbor hantaviruses. Recently, novel hantavirus genomes have been detected in moles of the Family Talpidae, including the Japanese shrew mole (Urotrichus talpoides) and American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii). We present new insights into the evolutionary history of hantaviruses gained from a highly divergent hantavirus, designated Nova virus (NVAV), identified in the European common mole (Talpa europaea) captured in Hungary. Methodology/Principal Findings Pair-wise alignment and comparison of the full-length S- and L-genomic segments indicated moderately low sequence similarity of 54–65% and 46–63% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively, between NVAV and representative rodent- and soricid-borne hantaviruses. Despite the high degree of sequence divergence, the predicted secondary structure of the NVAV nucleocapsid protein exhibited the characteristic coiled-coil domains at the amino-terminal end, and the L-segment motifs, typically found in hantaviruses, were well conserved. Phylogenetic analyses, using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, showed that NVAV formed a distinct clade that was evolutionarily distant from all other hantaviruses. Conclusions Newly identified hantaviruses harbored by shrews and moles support long-standing virus-host relationships and suggest that ancestral soricomorphs, rather than rodents, may have been the early or original mammalian hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2020387287,"Sunburn is a commonly occurring acute inflammatory process, with dermal vasodilatation and leukocyte infiltration as central features. Ultraviolet (UV) B-induced hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids releases polyunsaturated fatty acids, and their subsequent metabolism by cyclooxygenases (COXs) and lipoxygenases (LOXs) may produce potent eicosanoid mediators modulating different stages of the inflammation. Our objective was to identify candidate eicosanoids formed during the sunburn reaction in relation to its clinical and histological course. We exposed skin of healthy humans (n=32) to UVB and, for 72 h, examined expression of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids using LC/ESI-MS/MS, and examined immunohistochemical expression of COX-2, 12-LOX, 15-LOX, and leukocyte markers, while quantifying clinical erythema. We show that vasodilatory prostaglandins (PGs) PGE(2), PGF(2alpha), and PGE(3) accompany the erythema in the first 24-48 h, associated with increased COX-2 expression at 24 h. Novel, potent leukocyte chemoattractants 11-, 12-, and 8-monohydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) are elevated from 4 to 72 h, in association with peak dermal neutrophil influx at 24 h, and increased dermal CD3(+) lymphocytes and 12- and 15-LOX expression from 24 to 72 h.

https://openalex.org/W2039246437,"Hyp mice possess a mutation that inactivates the phosphate-regulating gene, which is homologous to the endopeptidases of the X-chromosome (PHEX). The mutation is associated with severe hypophosphatemia due to excessive urinary phosphate wasting. Such urinary phosphate wasting in Hyp mice is associated with an increased serum accumulation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23. We wanted to determine the biological significance of increased serum FGF23 levels and concomitant hypophosphatemia in Hyp mice and to evaluate whether FGF23 activity could be modified by manipulating klotho (a cofactor of FGF23 signaling). We generated Hyp and klotho double-mutant mice (Hyp/klotho(-/-)). Severe hypophosphatemia of Hyp mice was reversed to hyperphosphatemia in Hyp/klotho(-/-) double mutants, despite the fact that the double mutants showed significantly increased serum levels of FGF23. Hyperphosphatemia in Hyp/klotho(-/-) mice was associated with increased renal expression of sodium/phosphate cotransporter 2a (NaPi2a) protein. Exogenous injection of bioactive parathyroid hormone 1-34 down-regulated renal expression of NaPi2a and consequently reduced serum levels of phosphate in Hyp/klotho(-/-) mice. Moreover, in contrast to the Hyp mice, the Hyp/klotho(-/-) mice showed significantly higher serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and developed extensive calcification in soft tissues and vascular walls. Furthermore, compared with the Hyp mice, Hyp/klotho(-/-) mice were smaller in size, showed features of generalized tissue atrophy, and generally died by 15-20 wk of age. Our in vivo studies provide genetic evidence for a pathological role of increased FGF23 activities in regulating abnormal phosphate homeostasis in Hyp mice. Moreover, these results suggest that even when serum levels of FGF23 are significantly high, in the absence of klotho, FGF23 is unable to regulate systemic phosphate homeostasis. Our in vivo observations have significant clinical implications in diseases associated with increased FGF23 activity and suggest that the functions of FGF23 can be therapeutically modulated by manipulating the effects of klotho."
https://openalex.org/W1971383763,"The pathway of d-xylose degradation in archaea is unknown. In a previous study we identified in Haloarcula marismortui the first enzyme of xylose degradation, an inducible xylose dehydrogenase (Johnsen, U., and Schönheit, P. (2004) J. Bacteriol. 186, 6198–6207). Here we report a comprehensive study of the complete d-xylose degradation pathway in the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii. The analyses include the following: (i) identification of the degradation pathway in vivo following 13C-labeling patterns of proteinogenic amino acids after growth on [13C]xylose; (ii) identification of xylose-induced genes by DNA microarray experiments; (iii) characterization of enzymes; and (iv) construction of in-frame deletion mutants and their functional analyses in growth experiments. Together, the data indicate that d-xylose is oxidized exclusively to the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate, involving d-xylose dehydrogenase (HVO_B0028), a novel xylonate dehydratase (HVO_B0038A), 2-keto-3-deoxyxylonate dehydratase (HVO_B0027), and α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (HVO_B0039). The functional involvement of these enzymes in xylose degradation was proven by growth studies of the corresponding in-frame deletion mutants, which all lost the ability to grow on d-xylose, but growth on glucose was not significantly affected. This is the first report of an archaeal d-xylose degradation pathway that differs from the classical d-xylose pathway in most bacteria involving the formation of xylulose 5-phosphate as an intermediate. However, the pathway shows similarities to proposed oxidative pentose degradation pathways to α-ketoglutarate in few bacteria, e.g. Azospirillum brasilense and Caulobacter crescentus, and in the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus. The pathway of d-xylose degradation in archaea is unknown. In a previous study we identified in Haloarcula marismortui the first enzyme of xylose degradation, an inducible xylose dehydrogenase (Johnsen, U., and Schönheit, P. (2004) J.

However, the pathway shows similarities to proposed oxidative pentose degradation pathways to α-ketoglutarate in few bacteria, e.g. Azospirillum brasilense and Caulobacter crescentus, and in the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus. d-Xylose, a constituent of the polymer xylan, is the major component of the hemicellulose plant cell wall material and thus one of the most abundant carbohydrates in nature. The utilization of d-xylose by microorganisms has been described in detail in bacteria and fungi, for which two different catabolic pathways have been reported. In many bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus, and Lactobacillus species, xylose is converted by the activities of xylose isomerase and xylulose kinase to xylulose 5-phosphate as an intermediate, which is further degraded mainly by the pentose phosphate cycle or phosphoketolase pathway. Most fungi convert xylose to xylulose 5-phosphate via xylose reductase, xylitol dehydrogenase, and xylulose kinase. Xylulose 5-phosphate is also an intermediate of the most common l-arabinose degradation pathway in bacteria, e.g. of E. coli, via activities of isomerase, kinase, and epimerase (1van de Werken H.J. Brouns S.J. van der Oost J. Archaea: New Models for Prokaryotic Biology.in: Blum P. Caister/Academic Press, Norfolk, UK2008: 71-94Google Scholar). Recently, by genetic evidence, a third pathway of xylose degradation was proposed for the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus, in analogy to an alternative catabolic pathway of l-arabinose, reported for some bacteria, including species of Azospirillum, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, Burkholderia, and Herbasprillum (2Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Kodak T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2612-2623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 3Brouns S.J. Walther J. Snijders A.P. van de Werken H.J.

In these organisms l-arabinose is oxidatively degraded to α-ketoglutarate, an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, via the activities of l-arabinose dehydrogenase, l-arabinolactonase, and two successive dehydration reactions forming 2-keto-3-deoxy-l-arabinoate and α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde; the latter compound is further oxidized to α-ketoglutarate via NADP+-specific α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (KGSADH). 2The abbreviations used are: KGSADHα-ketoglutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenaseXADd-xylonate dehydrataseNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidRTreverse transcriptionKDXD2-keto-3-deoxyxylonate dehydrataseXDHxylose dehydrogenaseGFORglucose-fructose oxidoreductaseGADgluconate dehydrataseORFopen reading frameMR/MLEmandelate racemase/muconate lactonizing enzyme. In a few Pseudomonas and Rhizobium species, a variant of this l-arabinose pathway was described involving aldolase cleavage of the intermediate 2-keto-3-deoxy-l-arabinoate to pyruvate and glycolaldehyde, rather than its dehydration and oxidation to α-ketoglutarate (4Watanabe S. Shimada N. Tajima K. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33521-33536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because of the presence of some analogous enzyme activities in xylose-grown cells of Azosprillum and Rhizobium, the oxidative pathway and its variant was also proposed as a catabolic pathway for d-xylose. Recent genetic analysis of Caulobacter crecentus indicates the presence of an oxidative pathway for d-xylose degradation to α-ketoglutarate. All genes encoding xylose dehydrogenase and putative lactonase, xylonate dehydratase, 2-keto-3-deoxylonate dehydratase, and KGSADH were found to be located on a xylose-inducible operon (5Stephens C. Christen B. Fuchs T. Sundaram V. Watanabe K. Jenal U. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 2181-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). With exception of xylose dehydrogenase, which has been partially characterized, the other postulated enzymes of the pathway have not been biochemically analyzed. α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase d-xylonate dehydratase nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid reverse transcription 2-keto-3-deoxyxylonate dehydratase xylose dehydrogenase glucose-fructose oxidoreductase gluconate dehydratase open reading frame mandelate racemase/muconate lactonizing enzyme. The pathway of d-xylose degradation in the domain of archaea has not been studied so far. First analyses with the halophilic archaeon Haloarcula marismortui indicate that the initial step of d-xylose degradation involves a xylose-inducible xylose dehydrogenase (6Johnsen U. Schönheit P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6198-6207Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) suggesting an oxidative pathway of xylose degradation to α-ketoglutarate, or to pyruvate and glycolaldehyde, in analogy to the proposed oxidative bacterial pentose degradation pathways. Recently, a detailed study of d-arabinose catabolism in the thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus was reported. d-Arabinose was found to be oxidized to α-ketoglutarate involving d-arabinose dehydrogenase, d-arabinoate dehydratase, 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-arabinoate dehydratase, and α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (3Brouns S.J. Walther J. Snijders A.P. van de Werken H.J. Willemen H.L. Worm P. de Vos M.G. Andersson A. Lundgren M. Mazon H.F. van den Heuvel R.H. Nilsson P. Salmon L. de Vos W.M. Wright P.C.

In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the complete d-xylose degradation pathway in the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii. This halophilic archaeon was chosen because it exerts several suitable properties for the analyses. For example, it can be cultivated on synthetic media with sugars, e.g. xylose, an advantage for in vivo labeling studies in growing cultures. Furthermore, a shotgun DNA microarray of H. volcanii is available (7Zaigler A. Schuster S.C. Soppa J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) allowing the identification of xylose-inducible genes, and H. volcanii is one of the few archaea for which an efficient protocol was recently described to generate in-frame deletion mutants. Accordingly, the d-xylose degradation pathway was elucidated following in vivo labeling experiments with [13C]xylose, DNA microarray analyses, and the characterization of enzymes involved and their encoding genes. The functional involvement of genes and enzymes was proven by constructing corresponding in-frame deletion mutants and their analysis by selective growth experiments on xylose versus glucose. The data show that d-xylose was exclusively degraded to α-ketoglutarate involving xylose dehydrogenase, a novel xylonate dehydratase, 2-keto-3-deoxyxylonate dehydratase, and α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase. DS70 strain H26 (ΔpyrE2), obtained from Thorsten Allers (University of Nottingham, United Kingdom), contained a uracil auxotrophy required for the construction of gene deletion mutants. The organism was grown aerobically at 42 °C on synthetic medium (7Zaigler A. Schuster S.C. Soppa J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) containing 25 mm either d-xylose or d-glucose and uracil (50 μg/ml). Growth was followed by an increase in absorbance at 600 nm; consumption of xylose and glucose during growth was determined as described (6Johnsen U. Schönheit P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6198-6207Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For gene deletion experiments involving the so-called pop-in/pop out strategy (see below) and for growth of deletion mutants (ΔHVO_B0027, ΔHVO_B0028, ΔHVO_B0029, ΔHVO_B0038A, and ΔHVO_B0039), a complex medium (8Wanner C. Soppa J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3114-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) containing 1% casamino acids was used. For pop-out selection, the medium was supplemented with 50 μg/ml each 5-fluoroorotic acid and uracil. H. volcanii was grown aerobically at 42 °C in 100-ml Erlenmeyer flasks (shaken at 150 rpm) filled with 20 ml of synthetic medium, containing [1-13C]xylose or [2-13C]xylose (each 25 mm). Cells were harvested during exponential growth phase (A600, 1.4) by centrifuging 20 ml of culture broth at 48,000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min. The biomass pellet was washed twice with 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl, hydrolyzed in 1.5 ml of 6 m HCl for 24 h at 110 °C in sealed 2-ml Eppendorf tubes, and desiccated overnight in a heating block at 85 °C under a constant air stream. The hydrolysate was dissolved in 50 μl of 99.8% dimethyl formamide and transferred into a new Eppendorf cup within a few seconds. For derivatization, 30 μl of N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide was added, which readily silylates hydroxyl groups, thiols, primary amines, amides, and carboxyl groups (9Dauner M. Sauer U. Biotechnol. Prog. 2000; 16: 642-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and the mixture was incubated at 550 rpm and 85 °C for 60 min. 1 μl of the derivatized sample was injected into a Series 8000 gas chromatograph, combined with an MD 800 mass spectrometer (Fisons Instruments), and analyzed as described earlier (10Nanchen A. Fuhrer T. Sauer U. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 358: 177-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Gas chromatograph temperature profile was 150 °C for 2 min, increased to 280 °C at 10 °C per min, and held at 280 °C for 3 min. Injector temperature was set to 280 °C, split ratio to 1:20, flow rate to 2 ml per min, and carrier gas was helium in a SPB-1 column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm; Agilent Technologies). Electron impact spectra were obtained at −70 eV with a full scan ranging from 70 to 560 m/z and a solvent delay of 4 min. Mass spectra of the derivatized amino acids alanine, aspartate, glutamate, proline, and threonine were corrected for the natural abundance of all stable isotopes and unlabeled biomass from inoculum. Glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, serine, tyrosine, and valine were not used in this study, whereas arginine, asparagine, cysteine, glutamine, and tryptophan were not detectable. The labeling patterns of the detected amino acids were direct and quantitative evidence for metabolic pathways leading from carbon substrate to the respective precursors. H. volcanii was grown in synthetic medium as described (7Zaigler A. Schuster S.C. Soppa J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), with either 0.25% (w/v) glucose or 0.25% xylose (w/v) as sole carbon and energy sources. Cells were harvested during mid-exponential growth phase (3–5 × 108 cells/ml). RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and labeling, DNA microarray hybridization, scanning, and data analysis were performed as described (7Zaigler A. Schuster S.C. Soppa J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Four biological replicates were performed. A dye-swap was included into the experimental design. All signals were visually inspected, and artifacts were removed. The results were exported from the scanning software (Genepix Pro 3.0), and further analysis was performed with Excel. All signals were removed that had a low or moderate signal intensity in the “xylose cDNA” (<1000 arbitrary units) to exclude all genes with low or moderate transcript levels during growth on xylose. Average values were calculated, and the results were sorted according to the induction level in xylose medium. Initially, only spots were included in the analysis that represent highly induced genes and were quantified in at least two of the four replicates. However, as first blast searches against the contigs of the provisional H. volcanii genome revealed that most of these clones were concentrated on two genomic regions, all clones representing these regions with at least 6-fold induction levels were included, even if they were quantified only in a single experiment. It should be noted that singletons can be regarded as “replicates” when they overlap or indicate induction of several genes of one operon. A table with clone identifiers and genomic localizations was prepared (Table 2), and the two genomic regions represented by 25 clones were annotated.TABLE 2Summary of DNA microarray spots representing H. volcanii genes with at least 6-fold induced transcript levels during growth on xyloseNo.IdentifierInduction levelExperimentsaThe number of replicates that met the analysis criteria (compare ″Experimental Procedures″).Genomic regionOverlapping genesFromTo1444-E117.1120,47021,784HVO_B0020-B00212438-E087.5121,01222,361HVO_B00213446-B0111.5122,36523,238HVO_B0021-B00224431-A0218.1124,09625,902HVO_B0023-B00245441-E125.8125,22526,597HVO_B00246444-H086.6125,70627,155HVO_B00247454-D0121.3329,90831,556HVO_B0027-B00288437-F0919.1435,25536,930HVO_B0032-B00349442-F0630.2435,51837,424HVO_B0032-B003410458-H0229.9436,10937,425HVO_B003411460-C0813.4436,93038,372HVO_B0034-B003512455-F1214.0436,93038,373HVO_B0034-B003513451-F126.4238,37141,121HVO_B0036-B003814441-H079.8338,60241,123HVO_B0036-B003815433-B0627.4139,28941,398HVO_B0037-B003816450-F046.9239,28941,646HVO_B0037-B003817456-A1213.4440,69242,221HVO_B0038, not annotated18443-F0713.7341,39942,657HVO_B0038, not annotated19446-F0314.0341,48942,191Not annotated20453-D128.9341,74143,257Not annotated21434-D0323.04270,085271,597HVO_B0228-B022922432-C0120.84270,591272,130HVO_B0228-B023023452-B1114.91272,259273,660HVO_B0230-B023224445-H046.61272,967274,530HVO_B0231-B023225439-C1214.23274,669276,341HVO_B023326457-E026.32787,532789,238HVO_086927448-H037.321,317,2011,318,546HVO_1445–144628441-A108.222,217,7272,218,596HVO_2351–235329435-B0910.022,500,3232,501,958HVO_2652–2653a The number of replicates that met the analysis criteria (compare ″Experimental Procedures″). Open table in a new tab The regions from 80,000 to 110,000 and 328,000 to 340,000 of contig 275 of the provisional H. volcanii genome sequence (March, 2006) were annotated. In a first step, all open reading frames (ORFs) with at least 100 codons were identified in all six reading frames. Haloarchaea have a high guanine-cytosine content and a very low fraction of stop codons, leading to an “overprediction problem” (11Pfeiffer F. Schuster S.C. Broicher A. Falb M. Palm P. Rodewald K. Ruepp A. Soppa J. Tittor J. Oesterhelt D. Genomics. 2008; 91: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Two approaches were used to separate real genes from artificial ORFs. First, a codon preference analysis of the two genomic regions was performed with the program “codon preference” of the HUSAR program package, which had been shown earlier to aid in the identification of genes as well as the correct regions of translation initiation (12Soppa J. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1994; 16: 725-733Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, blast searches of the predicted proteins against protein sequence libraries (TrEMBL, Swiss Prot) were performed. Furthermore, multiple sequence analyses were performed with ClustalW to enhance the quality of start codon selection. In summary, this led to an annotation, which was virtually identical to the currently available annotation of the H. volcanii genome. One gene (between HVO_B0038 and HVO_B0039) coding for a putative protein of the enolase superfamily was not included in the official annotation. During this study, this gene, designated HVO_B0038A, was identified as a functional xylonate dehydratase. Crude extracts were prepared from late log phase xylose-grown cells and stored at −20 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 3.4 m NaCl (buffer A). Cells were disrupted by sonication, and after centrifugation, enzyme activities were determined in the supernatant. Protein was determined by the Bradford method. All enzyme assays were performed at 42 °C. Dehydrogenase activities were assayed by measuring following the rate of reduction of NADP+ or NAD+ at 340 nm. The standard assay mixture for XDH activity contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 m KCl, 20 mm d-xylose, 1 mm NADP+, and protein. NAD+ as cosubstrate was tested at concentrations up to 5 mm. For substrate specificity the following sugars were tested: d-xylose up to 25 mm, l-arabinose up to 50 mm, d-arabinose up to 100 mm, d-ribose up to 50 mm, d-glucose up to 160 mm, d-mannose up to 50 mm, and l-mannose up to 15 mm. The standard assay mixture for KGSADH activity contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2.5 m KCl, 1 mm NADP+, 5 mm glutaraldehyde and protein. NAD+ was tested up to 5 mm and succinate semialdehyde up to 100 mm. α-Ketoglutarate semialdehyde as substrate was tested at 5 and 10 mm. XAD activity was determined according to Ref. 13Johnsen U. Selig M. Xavier K.B. Santos H. Schönheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 175: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar. The assay mixture contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 m KCl, 50 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm each d-xylonate, d-gluconate, and d-galactonate. The NAD(P)+-dependent conversion of d-xylonate to α-ketoglutarate was assayed in crude extracts of d-xylose- and d-glucose-grown cells of H. volcanii. The assay mixture contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 m KCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 4 mm NADP+ or NAD+, 20 mm d-xylonate, and crude extract. Samples were incubated at 42 °C up to 120 min; the reaction was stopped on ice, and the amount of α-ketoglutarate formed was quantified by measuring the reductive amination of α-ketoglutarate to glutamate at 365 nm. The reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 mm NADH, 40 mm ammonium chloride, 0.94 units of glutamate dehydrogenase (Sigma) and 40 μl of the samples. The xylonate-dependent formation of pyruvate was tested with crude extracts from d-xylose-grown cells of H. volcanii. The assay mixture contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 m KCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 20 mm d-xylonate, and crude extract. After incubation at 42 °C up to 120 min, samples were cooled on ice, and the pyruvate formed was measured by reduction to lactate with lactate dehydrogenase at 365 nm and 20 °C. The reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 0.1 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.3 mm NADH, 3 units of lactate dehydrogenase, and 40 μl of the samples. For purification of XAD and KGSADH, cells were suspended in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 m ammonium sulfate (buffer B); for XAD, the buffer was supplemented with 50 mm MgCl2. Cells were disrupted by passing through a French pressure cell followed by centrifugation for 90 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. Further purification steps were as follows. The 100,000 × g supernatant was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (60 ml) equilibrated with buffer B containing 50 mm MgCl2. After washing the column, protein was eluted with a linear gradient of decreasing ammonium sulfate concentration with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 50 mm MgCl2. Fractions containing the highest enzyme activity were pooled and concentrated to 1 ml by ultrafiltration (cutoff 10 kDa). This solution was applied to a Superdex 200 HiLoad gel filtration column (1.6 × 60 cm) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 m KCl. The purity of fractions containing activity was checked by SDS-PAGE, and the 52-kDa protein band was analyzed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing (14Meyer C. Schmid R. Scriba P.C. Wehling M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A further purification step involves chromatography on a Sepharose CL4B column (5 ml). Protein samples obtained from Superdex column were dialyzed against a 1000-fold volume of buffer B containing 50 mm MgCl2 and then applied to CL4B column equilibrated with the same buffer. Protein was eluted with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 50 mm MgCl2. After this purification step, XAD was purified about 100-fold to a specific activity of 1.1 units/mg with xylonate. The 100,000 × g supernatant was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (60 ml) equilibrated with buffer B. After washing the column with buffer B, the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of decreasing ammonium sulfate concentration with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10% glycerol (buffer C). Fraction containing the highest enzyme activity was pooled and concentrated to 1 ml by ultrafiltration (cutoff 10 kDa). The concentrated protein solution was applied to a Superdex 200 HiLoad gel filtration column (1.6 × 60 cm) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 m NaCl and 10% glycerol (buffer D). Fractions containing enzyme activity were diluted with buffer containing ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 2 m ammonium sulfate in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and were applied to a Sepharose CL4B (5 ml) column. After washing the column with buffer B, protein was eluted with a linear gradient of decreasing ammonium sulfate concentration with buffer C. Eluted fractions containing enzyme activity indicated purified enzyme and were stored at 4 °C. The purity of the preparation was checked by SDS-PAGE, and the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme was determined. HVO_B0028, HVO_B0029, HVO_B0038A, and HVO_B0039 coding for XDH, putative glucose-fructose oxidoreductase (GFOR), XAD, and KGSADH, respectively, were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using ProofStart polymerase (Qiagen) or Pwo polymerase (peqlab) (supplemental Table 1S). The PCR products were each cloned into pET19b. The resulting plasmid were harvested from E. coli JM109, sequenced, and transformed into E. coli Rosetta(DE3)-pLysS expression strain (Stratagene). For expression, cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C. The expression was started by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 4 h of further growth, cells were harvested by centrifugation. Recombinant XDH and putative GFOR, XAD, and KGSADH were purified from transformed E. coli cells, which were disrupted by passages through French pressure cells and centrifuged. The first purification step used for all enzymes was Ni-NTA chromatography. The proteins, which were specifically eluted with imidazole, do not show catalytic activity due to misfolding after expression in the nonhalophilic E. coli. To generate catalytic active recombinant enzymes, they were reactivated following unfolding by urea and refolding in the presence of salts and substrates by a modified protocol according to Ref. 15Connaris H. Chaudhuri J.B. Danson M.J. Hough D.W. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 64: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar. Specific conditions for further purification steps were as follows. After Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, the purified proteins were concentrated with a 30-kDa cutoff filter (Millipore) and dialyzed for 20 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 3 m KCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol (buffer F). After centrifugation, protein was unfolded by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 8 m urea, 50 mm 1,4-dithioerythritol, and 2 mm EDTA. Refolding was initiated by dialysis in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 3 m KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mm d-xylose, 0.1 mm NADP+, 3 mm reduced glutathione, and 0.3 mm oxidized glutathione for 20 h at 4 °C followed by a centrifugation step. By this procedure a catalytically active XDH was obtained as measured by xylose-dependent NADP+ reduction. Protein was concentrated with a 30-kDa cutoff filter, centrifuged, and applied to a Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/60 gel filtration column that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. After Ni-NTA chromatography, selected fractions were concentrated with a 10-kDa cutoff filter and unfolded in the presence of urea. Refolding was initiated by dialysis in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol, 3 m KCl, 0.5 mm d-xylose, 0.1 mm NAD+, 2 mm reduced glutathione, and 0.2 mm oxidized glutathione overnight. Protein was concentrated and applied to a Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/60 gel filtration column and eluted with an isocratic flow in buffer D. The refolded enzyme showed xylose dehydrogenase activity measured as xylose-dependent reduction of NADP+. After Ni-NTA chromatography selected fractions were concentrated with a 30-kDa cutoff filter and unfolded by urea treatment in the absence of EDTA. Refolding was initiated by dialysis in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 m KCl, 50 mm MgCl2, and 0.25 mm d-xylonate. However, no XAD activity could be detected after 24 or 48 h. After Ni-NTA chromatography selected fractions were concentrated with a 30-kDa cutoff filter in unfolding buffer without EDTA. Refolding was initiated by dialysis in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2.5 m KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05 mm NADP+, 1 mm glutaraldehyde, 1.5 mm glutathione (reduced), and 0.15 mm glutathione (oxidized). Protein was concentrated and applied to a Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/60 gel filtration column, and was eluted with an isocratic flow in buffer D. After this procedure, catalytic active enzyme was obtained measured as glutaraldehyde-dependent reduction of NADP+. RNA from xylose-grown cells of H. volcanii was isolated in the exponential growth phase at A600 of 1.6. Cells were cooled to 4 °C, harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and disrupted by freezing and crushing under liquid nitrogen by passing them through a Qiashredder column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA was extracted by using the RNeasy mini kit and RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen) as specified by the manufacturer. RT-PCR was carried out by the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit using 5–40 ng of total RNA (supplemental Table 2S). The construction of in-frame deletion mutants (ΔHVO_ B0028, ΔHVO_B0029, ΔHVO_B0038A, ΔHVO_B0027, or ΔHVO_B0039) was performed using an optimized version of the so-called pop-in/pop-out method (16Allers T. Ngo H.P. Mevarech M. Lloyd R.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) as described recently (17Hammelmann M. Soppa J. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2008; 75: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In each case two PCR fragments of about 500 bp (supplemental Table 3S) were amplified. PCR fragments include the up- and downstream regions of the corresponding gene. The two fragments were fused by PCR, generating an in-frame deletion product. The products were ligated into pTA131 (16Allers T. Ngo H.P. Mevarech M. Lloyd R.G. Ap"
https://openalex.org/W2022009274,"Although La Crosse virus (LACV) is one of the most common causes of pediatric arboviral infections in the United States, little has been done to assess its geographic distribution, identify areas of higher risk of disease, and to provide a national picture of its clinical presentation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the geographic distribution of LACV infections reported in the United States, to identify hot-spots of infection, and to present its clinical picture.Descriptive and cluster analyses were performed on probable and confirmed cases of LACV infections reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2003-2007. A total of 282 patients had reported confirmed LACV infections during the study period. Of these cases the majority (81 percent) presented during the summer, occurred in children 15 years and younger (83.3 percent), and were found in male children (64.9 percent). Clinically, the infections presented as meningioencephalitis (56.3 percent), encephalitis (20.7 percent), meningitis (17.2 percent), or uncomplicated fever (5 percent). Deaths occurred in 1.9 percent of confirmed cases, and in 8.6 percent of patients suffering from encephalitis. The majority of these deaths were in patients 15 years and younger. The county-level incidence risk among counties (n = 136) reporting both probable and confirmed cases for children 15 years and younger (n = 355) ranged from 0.2 to 228.7 per 100,000 persons. The southern United States experienced a significantly higher (p<0.05) incidence risk during the months of June, July, August, and October then the northern United States. There was significant (p<0.05) clustering of high risk in several geographic regions with three deaths attributed to complications from LAC encephalitis occurring in two of these hot-spots of infections.Both the incidence risk and case fatality rates were found to be higher than previously reported. We detected clustering in four geographic regions, a shift from the prior geographic distributions, and developed maps identifying high-risk areas. These findings are useful for raising awareness among health care providers regarding areas at a high risk of infections and for guiding targeted multifaceted interventions by public health officials."
https://openalex.org/W2162210964,"The transient receptor potential channel (TRP) family includes more than 30 proteins; they participate in various Ca(2+) dependent processes. TRPs are functionally diverse involving thermal, chemical and mechanical transducers which modulate the concentration of intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i). Ca(2+) triggers and/or regulates principal sperm functions during fertilization such as motility, capacitation and the acrosome reaction. Nevertheless, the presence of the TRPM subfamily in sperm has not been explored.Here we document with RT-PCR, western blot and immunocitochemistry analysis the presence of TRPM8 in human sperm. We also examined the participation of this channel in sperm function using specific agonists (menthol and temperature) and antagonists (BCTC and capsazepine). Computer-aided sperm analysis revealed that menthol did not significantly alter human sperm motility. In contrast, menthol induced the acrosome reaction in human sperm. This induction was inhibited about 70% by capsazepine (20 microM) and 80% by BCTC (1.6 microM). Activation of TRPM8 either by temperature or menthol induced [Ca(2+)]i increases in human sperm measured by fluorescence in populations or individual sperm cells, effect that was also inhibited by capsazepine (20 microM) and BCTC (1.6 microM). However, the progesterone and ZP3-induced acrosome reaction was not inhibited by capsazepine or BCTC, suggesting that TRPM8 activation triggers this process by a different signaling pathway.This is the first report dealing with the presence of a thermo sensitive channel (TRPM8) in human sperm. This channel could be involved in cell signaling events such as thermotaxis or chemotaxis."
https://openalex.org/W2168621999,"Potentiation of the pain-integrator ion channel transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) underlies thermal hyperalgesia mediated by a variety of proinflammatory factors. Two complementary mechanisms of TRPV1 inflammatory sensitization have been proposed, namely a decrease of its activation threshold and an increment of its surface expression in nociceptors. Here we investigated the involvement of regulated exocytosis to the inflammatory sensitization of TRPV1 in rat neonatal dorsal root ganglion neurons by proalgesic agents. The contribution of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-dependent exocytosis was evaluated using a small peptide patterned after the synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) protein that acts as a specific and potent inhibitor of neuronal exocytosis. We found that TRPV1 sensitization mediated by nerve growth factor, ATP, and IGF-I was accompanied by a higher channel expression in the neuronal plasma membrane, which was prevented by blockade of regulated exocytosis. In contrast, TRPV1 sensitization caused by bradykinin, IL-1beta, and artemin was insensitive to inhibition of SNARE-dependent vesicular fusion and was not due to an increase in TRPV1 surface expression. Therefore, it appears that some, but not all, proinflammatory agents sensitize rat nociceptors by promoting the recruitment of TRPV1 channels to the neuronal surface. These findings support the tenet that SNARE complex-mediated exocytosis of TRPV1 may be a valid therapeutic target to treat inflammatory pain."
https://openalex.org/W2086398461,"Defence against predators is usually accompanied by declining rates of growth or development. The classical growth/predation risk tradeoff assumes reduced activity as the cause of these declines. However, in many cases these costs cannot be explained by reduced foraging effort or enhanced allocation to defensive structures under predation risk. Here, we tested for a physiological origin of defence costs by measuring oxygen consumption in tadpoles (Rana temporaria) exposed to predation risk over short and long periods of time. The short term reaction was an increase in oxygen consumption, consistent with the ""fight-or-flight"" response observed in many organisms. The long term reaction showed the opposite pattern: tadpoles reduced oxygen consumption after three weeks exposure to predators, which would act to reduce the growth cost of predator defence. The results point to an instantaneous and reversible stress response to predation risk. This suggests that the tradeoff between avoiding predators and growing rapidly is not caused by changes in metabolic rate, and must be sought in other behavioural or physiological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2059934269,"Background Segregation of the trophectoderm from the inner cell mass of the embryo represents the first cell-fate decision of mammalian development. Transcription factors essential for specifying trophectoderm have been identified, but the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in modulating this fate-choice has been largely unexplored. We have compared miRNA expression in embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived trophectoderm and in staged murine embryos to identify a set of candidate miRNAs likely to be involved in trophectoderm specification. Results We profiled embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as they were induced to differentiate into trophectodermal cells by ectopic expression of HRas/Q61L. We also profiled murine embryos at progressive stages of preimplantation development (zygote, 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst), which includes the time window in which the trophectoderm is specified in vivo. Q61L/H Conclusions We describe miRNA expression changes that occur during trophectoderm specification and validate that our in vitro system faithfully recapitulates trophectoderm specification in vivo. By comparing our in vitro and in vivo datasets, we have identified a minimal set of candidate miRNAs likely to play a role in trophectoderm specification. These miRNAs are predicted to regulate a host of development-associated target genes, and many of these miRNAs have previously reported roles in development and differentiation. Additionally, we highlight a number of miRNAs whose tight developmental regulation may reflect a functional role in other stages of embryogenesis. Our embryo profiling data may be useful to investigators studying trophectoderm specification and other stages of preimplantation development."
https://openalex.org/W2051076185,"The SLC25 carrier family mediates solute transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane, a process that is still poorly characterized regarding both the mechanisms and proteins implicated. This study investigated mitochondrial glutamate carrier GC1 in insulin-secreting beta-cells. GC1 was cloned from insulin-secreting cells, and sequence analysis revealed hydropathy profile of a six-transmembrane protein, characteristic of mitochondrial solute carriers. GC1 was found to be expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in INS-1E beta-cells and pancreatic rat islets. Immunohistochemistry showed that GC1 was present in mitochondria, and ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy revealed inner mitochondrial membrane localization of the transporter. Silencing of GC1 in INS-1E beta-cells, mediated by adenoviral delivery of short hairpin RNA, reduced mitochondrial glutamate transport by 48% (p < 0.001). Insulin secretion at basal 2.5 mM glucose and stimulated either by intermediate 7.5 mM glucose or non-nutrient 30 mM KCl was not modified by GC1 silencing. Conversely, insulin secretion stimulated with optimal 15 mM glucose was reduced by 23% (p < 0.005) in GC1 knocked down cells compared with controls. Adjunct of cell-permeant glutamate (5 mM dimethyl glutamate) fully restored the secretory response at 15 mM glucose (p < 0.005). Kinetics of insulin secretion were investigated in perifused isolated rat islets. GC1 silencing in islets inhibited the secretory response induced by 16.7 mM glucose, both during first (-25%, p < 0.05) and second (-33%, p < 0.05) phases. This study demonstrates that insulin-secreting cells depend on GC1 for maximal glucose response, thereby assigning a physiological function to this newly identified mitochondrial glutamate carrier."
https://openalex.org/W2024719302,"Background Reduced expression of developmentally important genes and tumor suppressors due to haploinsufficiency or epigenetic suppression has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of various malignancies. However, methodology that allows spatio-temporally knockdown of gene expression in various model organisms such as zebrafish has not been well established, which largely limits the potential of zebrafish as a vertebrate model of human malignant disorders. Principal Finding Here, we report that multiple copies of small hairpin RNA (shRNA) are expressed from a single transcript that mimics the natural microRNA-30e precursor (mir-shRNA). The mir-shRNA, when microinjected into zebrafish embryos, induced an efficient knockdown of two developmentally essential genes chordin and α-catenin in a dose-controllable fashion. Furthermore, we designed a novel cassette vector to simultaneously express an intronic mir-shRNA and a chimeric red fluorescent protein driven by lineage-specific promoter, which efficiently reduced the expression of a chromosomally integrated reporter gene and an endogenously expressed gata-1 gene in the developing erythroid progenitors and hemangioblasts, respectively. Significance This methodology provides an invaluable tool to knockdown developmental important genes in a tissue-specific manner or to establish animal models, in which the gene dosage is critically important in the pathogenesis of human disorders. The strategy should be also applicable to other model organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2115394766,"Associative conditioning is a ubiquitous form of learning throughout the animal kingdom and fear conditioning is one of the most widely researched models for studying its neurobiological basis. Fear conditioning is also considered a model system for understanding phobias and anxiety disorders. A fundamental issue in fear conditioning regards the existence and location of neurons in the brain that receive convergent information about the conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US) during the acquisition of conditioned fear memory. Convergent activation of neurons is generally viewed as a key event for fear learning, yet there has been almost no direct evidence of this critical event in the mammalian brain.Here, we used Arc cellular compartmental analysis of temporal gene transcription by fluorescence in situ hybridization (catFISH) to identify neurons activated during single trial contextual fear conditioning in rats. To conform to temporal requirements of catFISH analysis we used a novel delayed contextual fear conditioning protocol which yields significant single- trial fear conditioning with temporal parameters amenable to catFISH analysis. Analysis yielded clear evidence that a population of BLA neurons receives convergent CS and US information at the time of the learning, that this only occurs when the CS-US arrangement is supportive of the learning, and that this process requires N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation. In contrast, CS-US convergence was not observed in dorsal hippocampus.Based on the pattern of Arc activation seen in conditioning and control groups, we propose that a key requirement for CS-US convergence onto BLA neurons is the potentiation of US responding by prior exposure to a novel CS. Our results also support the view that contextual fear memories are encoded in the amygdala and that the role of dorsal hippocampus is to process and transmit contextual CS information."
https://openalex.org/W2044056487,"The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of p55 TNF Receptor (p55 TNFR), the main signaling receptor for the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF), in the development of two vascular disorders: atherosclerosis and angiotensin (Ang) II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).p55 TNFR deficient mice were crossed to an LDL receptor deficient background and were induced for the development of either atherosclerosis or AngII-induced AAA, and compared to littermate controls, wild-type for p55 TNFR expression. p55 TNFR deficient mice developed 43% smaller atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic sinuses compared to controls. Moreover, expression of CD68, a macrophage specific marker, exhibited a 50% reduction in the aortic arches. Decreased atherosclerosis correlated with a strong down-regulation in the expression of adhesion molecules, such as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, by p55 TNFR deficient endothelium. In addition, expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines TNF, IL-6, MCP-1 and RANTES were significantly reduced in aortas of p55 TNFR deficient mice. In contrast, in the AngII-induced model of AAA, p55 TNFR deficiency correlated with a slight trend towards increased aneurismal lethality, but the incidence of aortic rupture due to a dissecting aneurysm, and the expansion of the suprarenal aorta were not significantly different compared to controls.We found that p55 TNFR expression promotes atherosclerosis, among other mechanisms, by enhancing expression of endothelial adhesion molecules, while it seems to have no major role in the development of AngII-induced AAA."

Apparently, however, not all mussel adhesive proteins are beholden to Dopa chemistry. The cDNA-deduced sequence of Pvfp-1, a highly aromatic and redox active byssal coating protein in the green mussel Perna viridis, suggests that Dopa may be replaced by a post-translational modification of tryptophan. The N-terminal tryptophan-rich domain of Pvfp-1 contains 42 decapeptide repeats with the consensus sequences ATPKPW(1)TAW(2)K and APPPAW(1)TAW(2)K. A small collagen domain (18 Gly-X-Y repeats) is also present. Tandem mass spectrometry of isolated tryptic decapeptides has detected both C(2)-hexosylated tryptophan (W(1)) and C(2)-hexosylated hydroxytryptophan (W(2)), the latter of which is redox active. The UV absorbance spectrum of W(2) is consistent with 7-hydroxytryptophan, which represents an intriguing new theme for bioinspired opportunistic wet adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2134222959,"Communication between the cell surface and the nucleus is essential for regulated gene expression. In neurons, Ca(2+)-dependent gene transcription is sensitive to local Ca(2+) entry. In immune cells, excitation-transcription coupling is thought to involve global Ca(2+) signals. Here, we show that in mast cells, Ca(2+) microdomains from store-operated Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) channels activate expression of the transcription factor c-fos. Local Ca(2+) entry is sensed by the tyrosine kinase Syk, which signals to the nucleus through the transcription factor STAT5. Ca(2+) microdomains also promote secretion of proinflammatory messengers, which, like gene expression, requires Syk. Syk therefore couples Ca(2+) microdomains to the activation of two spatially and temporally distinct cellular responses, revealing the versatility of local Ca(2+) signals in driving cell activation."

These hormones are believed to have evolved from a common ancestral gene through several rounds of gene duplication and subsequent divergence.In this study, we have identified a new PRL-like gene in non-mammalian vertebrates through bioinformatics and molecular cloning means. Phylogenetic analyses showed that this novel protein is homologous to the previously identified PRL. A receptor transactivation assay further showed that this novel protein could bind to PRL receptor to trigger the downstream post-receptor event, indicating that it is biologically active. In view of its close phylogenetic relationship with PRL and also its ability to activate PRL receptor, we name it as PRL2 and the previously identified PRL as PRL1. All the newly discovered PRL2 sequences possess three conserved disulfide linkages with the exception of the shark PRL2 which has only two. In sharp contrast to the classical PRL1 which is predominantly expressed in the pituitary, PRL2 was found to be mainly expressed in the eye and brain of the zebrafish but not in the pituitary. A largely reduced inner nuclear layer of the retina was observed after morpholino knockdown of zebrafish PRL2, indicating its role on retina development in teleost.The discovery of this novel PRL has revitalized our understanding on the evolution of the GH/PRL/SL/PL gene family. Its unique expression and functions in the zebrafish eye also provide a new avenue of research on the neuroendocrine control of retina development in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2057396381,"The cis-trans peptidylprolyl isomerase Pin1 plays a critical role in regulating a subset of phosphoproteins by catalyzing conformational changes on the phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs. The phosphorylation-directed ubiquitination is one of the major mechanisms to regulate the abundance of p27(Kip1). In this study, we demonstrate that Pin1 catalyzes the cis-trans conformational changes of p27(Kip1) and further mediates its stability through the polyubiquitination mechanism. Our results show that the phosphorylated Thr-187-Pro motif in p27(Kip1) is a key Pin1-binding site. In addition, NMR analyses show that this phosphorylated Thr-187-Pro site undergoes conformational change catalyzed by Pin1. Moreover, in Pin1 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts, p27(Kip1) has a shorter lifetime and displays a higher degree of polyubiquitination than in Pin1 wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting that Pin1 plays a critical role in regulating p27(Kip1) degradation. Additionally, Pin1 dramatically reduces the interaction between p27(Kip1) and Cks1, possibly via isomerizing the cis-trans conformation of p27(Kip1). Our study thus reveals a novel regulatory mechanism for p27(Kip1) stability and sheds new light on the biological function of Pin1 as a general regulator of protein stability."
https://openalex.org/W2073617599,"Background Mouse AA-amyloidosis is a transmissible disease by a prion-like mechanism where amyloid fibrils act by seeding. Synthetic peptides with no amyloid relationship can assemble into amyloid-like fibrils and these may have seeding capacity for amyloid proteins. Principal Findings Several synthetic peptides, designed for nanotechnology, have been examined for their ability to produce fibrils with Congo red affinity and concomitant green birefringence, affinity for thioflavin S and to accelerate AA-amyloidosis in mice. It is shown that some amphiphilic fibril-forming peptides not only produced Congo red birefringence and showed affinity for thioflavin S, but they also shortened the lag phase for systemic AA-amyloidosis in mice when they were given intravenously at the time of inflammatory induction with silver nitride. Peptides, not forming amyloid-like fibrils, did not have such properties. Conclusions These observations should caution researchers and those who work with synthetic peptides and their derivatives to be aware of the potential health concerns."
https://openalex.org/W2101218774,"The Pex5p receptor recognizes newly synthesized peroxisomal matrix proteins which have a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal to the peroxisome. After docking to protein complexes on the membrane, these proteins are translocated across the membrane. The docking mechanism remains unclear, as no structural data on the multicomponent docking complex are available. As the interaction of the cargo-loaded Pex5p receptor and the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex14p is the essential primary docking step, we have investigated the solution structure of these complexes by small angle x-ray scattering and static light scattering. Titration studies yielded a 1:6 stoichiometry for the Pex5p.Pex14p complex, and low resolution structural models were reconstructed from the x-ray scattering data. The free full-length human Pex5p is monomeric in solution, with an elongated, partially unfolded N-terminal domain. The model of the complex reveals that the N terminus of Pex5p remains extended in the presence of cargo and Pex14p, the latter proteins being significantly intermingled with the Pex5p moiety. These results suggest that the extended structure of Pex5p may play a role in interactions with other substrates such as lipids and membrane proteins during the formation of functional multiprotein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2010101361,"MicroRNAs are increasingly being recognized as regulators of embryonic development; however, relatively few microRNAs have been identified to regulate cardiac development. FOG-2 (also known as zfpm2) is a transcriptional co-factor that we have previously shown is critical for cardiac development. In this report, we demonstrate that FOG-2 expression is controlled at the translational level by microRNA-130a. We identified a conserved region in the FOG-2 3′ untranslated region predicted to be a target for miR-130a. To test the functional significance of this site, we generated an expression construct containing the luciferase coding region fused with the 3′ untranslated region of FOG-2 or a mutant version lacking this microRNA binding site. When these constructs were transfected into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (which are known to express miR-130a), we observed a 3.3-fold increase in translational efficiency when the microRNA target site was disrupted. Moreover, knockdown of miR-130a in fibroblasts resulted in a 3.6-fold increase in translational efficiency. We also demonstrate that cardiomyocytes express miR-130a and can attenuate translation of mRNAs with a FOG-2 3′ untranslated region. Finally, we generated transgenic mice with cardiomyocyte over-expression of miR-130a. In the hearts of these mice, FOG-2 protein levels were reduced by as much as 80%. Histological analysis of transgenic embryos revealed ventricular wall hypoplasia and ventricular septal defects, similar to that seen in FOG-2 deficient hearts. These results demonstrate the importance of miR-130a for the regulation of FOG-2 protein expression and suggest that miR-130a may also play a role in the regulation of cardiac development."
https://openalex.org/W1995562264,"Complex enzymes with multiple catalytic activities are hypothesized to have evolved from more primitive precursors. Global analysis of the Phytophthora sojae genome using conservative criteria for evaluation of complex proteins identified 273 novel multifunctional proteins that were also conserved in P. ramorum. Each of these proteins contains combinations of protein motifs that are not present in bacterial, plant, animal, or fungal genomes. A subset of these proteins were also identified in the two diatom genomes, but the majority of these proteins have formed after the split between diatoms and oomycetes. Documentation of multiple cases of domain fusions that are common to both oomycetes and diatom genomes lends additional support for the hypothesis that oomycetes and diatoms are monophyletic. Bifunctional proteins that catalyze two steps in a metabolic pathway can be used to infer the interaction of orthologous proteins that exist as separate entities in other genomes. We postulated that the novel multifunctional proteins of oomycetes could function as potential Rosetta Stones to identify interacting proteins of conserved metabolic and regulatory networks in other eukaryotic genomes. However ortholog analysis of each domain within our set of 273 multifunctional proteins against 39 sequenced bacterial and eukaryotic genomes, identified only 18 candidate Rosetta Stone proteins. Thus the majority of multifunctional proteins are not Rosetta Stones, but they may nonetheless be useful in identifying novel metabolic and regulatory networks in oomycetes. Phylogenetic analysis of all the enzymes in three pathways with one or more novel multifunctional proteins was conducted to determine the probable origins of individual enzymes. These analyses revealed multiple examples of horizontal transfer from both bacterial genomes and the photosynthetic endosymbiont in the ancestral genome of Stramenopiles. The complexity of the phylogenetic origins of these metabolic pathways and the paucity of Rosetta Stones relative to the total number of multifunctional proteins suggests that the proteome of oomycetes has few features in common with other Kingdoms."
https://openalex.org/W2088709355,"Background The high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) is a crucial structure for IgE-mediated allergic reactions. We have previously demonstrated that human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells express the tetrameric (αβγ2) FcεRI, and its activation leads to marked transient increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, release of Th-2 cytokines and eotaxin-1/CCL11. Therefore, it was of utmost importance to delineate the factors regulating the expression of FcεRI in human (ASM) cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Incubation of human bronchial and tracheal smooth muscle (B/TSM) cells with TNF-α, IL-1β or IL-4 resulted in a significant increase in FcεRI-α chain mRNA expression (p<0.05); and TNF-α, IL-4 enhanced the FcεRI-α protein expression compared to the unstimulated control at 24, 72 hrs after stimulation. Interestingly, among all other cytokines, only TNF-α upregulated the FcεRI-γ mRNA expression. FcεRI-γ protein expression remained unchanged despite the nature of stimulation. Of note, as a functional consequence of FcεRI upregulation, TNF-α pre-sensitization of B/TSM potentially augmented the CC (eotaxin-1/CCL11 and RANTES/CCL5, but not TARC/CCL17) and CXC (IL-8/CXCL8, IP-10/CXCL10) chemokines release following IgE stimulation (p<0.05, n = 3). Furthermore, IgE sensitization of B/TSM cells significantly enhanced the transcription of selective CC and CXC chemokines at promoter level compared to control, which was abolished by Lentivirus-mediated silencing of Syk expression. Conclusions/Significance Our data depict a critical role of B/TSM in allergic airway inflammation via potentially novel mechanisms involving proinflammatory, Th2 cytokines and IgE/FcεRI complex."
https://openalex.org/W2139142739,"The adult, virgin mammary gland is a highly organized branched ductal network comprising two major cell types: myoepithelial and luminal epithelial cells. To study the role and mechanism of focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-mediated signaling in mammary gland development and differentiation, we used a conditional Fak-knockout mammary epithelial cell (MEC) transplantation model. Conditional Cre recombinase (Cre)-mediated Fak deletion in primary cultured MECs isolated from FAK(lox/lox)/Rosa26Cre-ERT2 donor mice caused loss of FAK in all mammary cells. Transplantation of Fak-knockout MECs in a cleared mammary fat pad of immune-deficient recipient mice resulted in development of new but dilated virgin ducts with a disrupted myoepithelial and luminal epithelial cell multilayer and aberrant ductal morphogenesis during pregnancy. In the absence of FAK, MECs spread poorly, showed enhanced Rho kinase (ROCK)-mediated cytoskeletal contractility, and failed to respond to receptor-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling. Likewise, FAK deficiency fully inhibited branching morphogenesis of mammary gland organoids in a ROCK-dependent manner. Altogether these data suggest a model in which FAK coordinates contractile forces in MECs to maintain the bilayered cellular organization of myoepithelial and luminal epithelial cells in ducts, thus allowing proper mammary gland development and function."

E3L is a bifunctional protein that contains an N-terminal DNA binding domain (BD) and a C-terminal double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-BD (residues 100–190), both of which contribute to viral pathogenesis by blocking the activation of cellular genes that respond to the viral infection. We report that expression of the dsRNA-BD alone inhibits not only the dsRNA-induced activation of interferon β (IFNβ) but also that of 5′-triphosphate single-stranded RNA and DNA-induced IFNβ activation even though E3L100–190 does not bind the latter two pathogen-associated molecular patterns. This inhibition occurs in both human HeLa and A549 cells, where RIG-I appears to be required for dsDNA-induced IFNβ activation.

Unexpectedly, the two residues most important for dsRNA binding are also critical for this domain's ability to inhibit all three nucleic acid-induced cellular responses. The cellular innate immune system is activated by the presence of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), 2The abbreviations used are: PAMPpathogen-associated molecular patternPRRpattern recognition receptordsRNAdouble-stranded RNAssRNAsingle-stranded RNAIFNinterferonMEFmouse embryo fibroblastDAIDNA activator of IRFVVvaccinia virusGFPgreen fluorescent proteinBDbinding domainTKthymidine kinaseWTwild typeKDknock downPKRprotein kinase activated by RNAIRFinterferon regulatory factor. which are recognized by cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs are present both at the cell surface and in endosomes to survey the extracellular space (e.g. toll-like receptors (TLRs)) and in the cytoplasm (e.g. NODs, and RIG-I-like receptors) (1Medzhitov R.

Nature. 2006; 442: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Bacterial PAMPs are generally structures unique to these microorganisms (e.g. lipid A or peptidoglycan motifs). Viral PAMPs, in contrast, are based on nucleic acids that are abundantly present in all organisms. The special features of viral nucleic acids that are recognized as PAMPs depend on their intracellular location (cytoplasm and endosome) and, in the case of viral RNAs, on their special structural features; namely, perfectly base-paired dsRNA, presumably the result of convergent transcription (3Colby C. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1969; 63: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 4Jacobs B.L. Langland J.O. Virology. 1996; 219: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), and the presence of free 5′-triphosphate ends (ppp-RNAs) (5Hornung V. Ellegast J. Kim S. Brzózka K. Jung A. Kato H. Poeck H.

All eukaryotic cellular RNAs are initiated with nucleotide 5′-triphosphates, and the possibilities for overlapping convergent transcription from cellular DNA genomes are not uncommon. However, most cellular RNAs are also made in the nucleus, and it is thought that essentially only ssRNAs without free 5′-triphosphate ends are allowed to enter the cytoplasm. Some cellular polymerase III transcripts with 5′-triphosphate ends do enter the cytoplasm, but their 5′-ends are thought to be stably bound to the proteins required for their nuclear export. Thus, perfectly base-paired dsRNAs and ppp-RNAs in the cytoplasm are essentially those which have been made there, i.e. they are most likely viral RNAs. Similarly, the presence of DNA in the cytosol elicits an IRF3-dependent innate immune response (7Stetson D.B. Medzhitov R.

RIG-I and mda-5 are DEXD/H box helicases with N-terminal CARDs (caspase recruitment domains), which are present in the cytoplasm of most cells and serve as PRRs of viral RNAs (9Kawai T. Akira S. J. Biochem. 2007; 141: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 10Yoneyama M. Fujita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15315-15318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). RIG-I serves as a PRR in most RNA virus infections and senses both 5′-ppp-ssRNAs and relatively short dsRNAs (<1 kilobase pair), whereas mda-5 is specifically required to mount an innate immune response to picornavirus infections and senses relatively long dsRNAs (>1 kilobase pair) (11Kato H. Takeuchi O. Mikamo-Satoh E. Hirai R. Kawai T. Matsushita K. Hiiragi A. Dermody T.S. Fujita T. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1601-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Upon interacting with their RNA PAMPs, RIG-I and mda-5 initiate a signaling cascade that activates the IFNβ promoter, leading to IFN production. IFN binding to its cell surface receptor then leads to the synthesis of multiple IFN-stimulated genes, which together help establish an antiviral state (12Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 13Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). RIG-I and mda-5 bind dsRNAs and signal via the mitochondrial adaptor IPS-1, but these helicases do not bind dsDNA (8Ishii K.J. Coban C. Kato H. Takahashi K. Torii Y. Takeshita F. Ludwig H. Sutter G. Suzuki K. Hemmi H. Sato S. Yamamoto M. Uematsu S. Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). DAI (DNA activator of IRFs), which contains two Z-DNA binding domains and which binds dsDNA but not dsRNA, was the first (and so far only) cytosolic DNA sensor to be identified (14Wang Z. Choi M.K. Ban T. Yanai H. Negishi H. Lu Y. Tamura T. Takaoka A. Nishikura K. Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5477-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Binding of dsDNA to DAI enhances its association with IRF3 and the kinase TBK1, and overexpression of DAI in MEFs selectively enhances DNA-mediated induction of type I IFNs and other genes involved in innate immunity. However, the adaptor through which DAI signals to IRF3 has not been identified. Furthermore, RNAi knockdown of DAI and the generation of DAI-deficient mice have indicated that DAI is not the only PRR for cytosolic DNA (15Takaoka A. Taniguchi T. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2008; 60: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Many viruses encode proteins that interfere with the innate immune response. For example, vaccinia virus (VV), a DNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm, encodes the E3L protein that antagonizes the effects of IFNs intracellularly (16Chang H.W. Watson J.C. Jacobs B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 4825-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Part of this antagonism is because of its dsRNA binding domain (residues 100–190), which is thought to sequester the dsRNA produced during virus infection. By binding dsRNAs, E3L inhibits the activation of PKR and other dsRNA-dependent IFN-stimulated genes (17Chang H.W. Jacobs B.L. Virology. 1993; 194: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 18Rivas C. Gil J. Mĕlková Z. Esteban M. Díaz-Guerra M. Virology. 1998; 243: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), thus relieving the translational block that is in part responsible for VV-induced apoptosis (19Lee S.B. Esteban M. Virology. 1994; 199: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). VV deleted of E3L has a narrower host range because of the failure to inhibit apoptosis (20Langland J.O. Jacobs B.L. Virology. 2002; 299: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and the deleterious effects of VV-Δ E3L infection can be compensated in large part by reducing cellular PKR levels (21Zhang P. Jacobs B.L. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 840-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Besides antagonizing the antiviral effects of the IFN-stimulated genes, E3L is also known to inhibit the dsRNA-induced activation of IFNβ (22Langland J.O. Kash J.C. Carter V. Thomas M.J. Katze M.G. Jacobs B.L. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 10083-10095Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), presumably because of its ability to interfere with the recognition of viral RNAs by the cytoplasmic helicases. This paper reports that the VV E3L dsRNA-BD alone (E3L100–190) also inhibits the 5′-ppp-ssRNA- and dsDNA-induced activation of IFNβ in both murine and human cells even though it does not bind to these nucleic acids. Unexpectedly, the two residues most important for dsRNA binding are also critical for this domain's ability to inhibit all three nucleic acid induced cellular responses. HeLa, A549, and MEF cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Some A549 cells were “knocked down” for RIG-I or IRF3 by infection with lentiviruses expressing micro RNAs targeting either RIG-I (5′-tgcaggttattctggactttat) or IRF3 mRNAs (5′-ggcccttcattgtagatctgat) (Rig-I-KD and IRF3-KD). 24 h post-inoculum, cells were selected with puromycin (10 μg/ml) for 72 h. rSeV-GFP(+), which expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) from a transgene between the M and F genes, and rSeV-E3L100–190, which expresses E3L100–190 from a similarly located transgene, were prepared as previously described (23Strähle L. Garcin D. Le Mercier P. Schlaak J.F. Kolakofsky D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7903-7913Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). DI-H4 stocks were described previously (24Strahle L. Garcin D. Kolakofsky D. Virology. 2006; 351: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used included mouse anti-Rig-I (Alexis), mouse anti-actin (Chemicon), mouse anti-HA (Berkeley Antibody Co., Inc.), and rabbit anti-Sendai P,V,C (homemade). FLAG-tagged RIG-I was obtained from Jurg Tshopp (Lausanne) and inserted into our expression vector pEBS. pβ-IFN-fl-lucter, which contains the firefly luciferase gene under the control of the human IFN-β promoter, was described previously (25King P. Goodbourn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30609-30615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pTK-rl-lucter, used as a transfection standard, contains the herpes simplex virus TK promoter region upstream of the Renilla luciferase gene (Promega). pEBS-E3L100–190 and pEBS-E3L100–190 (K167A/R168A) were described previously (26Strähle L. Marq J.B. Brini A. Hausmann S. Kolakofsky D. Garcin D. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 12227-12237Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). 100,000 cells were plated into 6-well plates 20 h before transfection with 1.5 μg of pβ-IFN-fl-lucter, 0.5 μg of pTK-rl-lucter, 1 μg of plasmids expressing RIG-I, E3L (according to the various figure legends), and TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus). At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were (or were not) infected with various SeV stocks or transfected with 5 μg of poly(I-C) (sigma) or 10 μg of poly(dAdT) using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent. Twenty hours later, cells were harvested and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity (dual-luciferase reporter assay system; Promega). Relative expression levels were calculated by dividing the firefly luciferase values by those of Renilla luciferase. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared using 0.5% Nonidet P-40 buffer. Equal amounts of total proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes by semidry transfer. The secondary antibodies used were alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (or mouse) immunoglobulin G (Bio-Rad). The immobilized proteins were detected by light-enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) and analyzed in a Bio-Rad light detector using Quantity One software. DNA for T7 RNA polymerase synthesis of model RNA1 was prepared by PCR using the partially complementary primers 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAgggACACACCACAACCAACCCACAAC-3′ (forward) (start sites are in lowercase type) and 5′-GAAAGAAAGGTGTGGTGTTGGTGTGGTTGTTGTGGGTTGGTTGTGG-3′ (reverse). Transcription was performed with 100 pmol of purified PCR product using T7 MEGAshortscript (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Biotinylated RNA1 was synthesized using equal amounts of 5′-biotin-UTP and UTP. The total T7 transcripts (unpurified ppp-ssRNA1) were digested with DNase I and then chromatographed on NucAway Spin columns (Ambion) to remove unincorporated nucleotides and DNA fragments. Slightly radiolabeled ([α-32P]CTP) T7 transcripts were further electrophoresed on 10% preparative denaturing gels. The major 55-nucleotide band was excised from the gel, and the RNA was eluted followed by ethanol precipitation. 1 μg of ppp-ssRNA1 was digested with 1 unit of RNase III (Ambion) for 60 min at 37 °C in 40 μl of 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (pH 7.9), or 50 ng of RNase A in 40 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.4 m NaCl (pH 7.9). The digestion products were then phenol/chloroform=extracted, ethanol-precipitated with 10 μg of glycogen, and electrophoresed on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel. Supernatants (400 μl (1×) or 1 600 μl (4×)) of MEF cells transfected with poly-I/C or poly(dA-dT) for 20 h were added to fresh MEF cells for 12 h, which were then infected with 20 plaque-forming units/cell of rVSV-GFP (Jacques Perrault, San Diego State University) for 14 h. Then cells were trypsinized and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter for GFP expression. Poly(dA-dT) was purchased from Sigma (catalog no. P0883). Wild-type SeV infection or infection with SeV-GFP activates the IFNβ promoter very poorly under normal conditions because of the robust expression of the viral C and V proteins, which counteract the host innate immune response. However, co-infection of cells with rSeV-GFP- and rSeV-expressing mRNA containing the complement of the GFP open reading frame does lead to IFNβ activation (26Strähle L. Marq J.B. Brini A. Hausmann S. Kolakofsky D. Garcin D. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 12227-12237Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This activation presumably results from the formation of GFP dsRNA, as this IFNβ activation does not occur when a SeV-expressing RFP replaces either of the SeV-expressing GFP RNAs. Moreover, the simultaneous expression of the dsRNA binding domain of the vaccinia virus E3L protein (residues 100–190) prevented the IFNβ activation, whereas expression of a mutant form of this domain that no longer bound dsRNA (K167A/R168A) (27Ho C.K. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2611-2614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) had no effect. More commonly, the SeV infection used to activate IFNβ is carried out with stocks containing relatively short, copyback DI genomes (Fig. 1, upper panel). In this case IFNβ activation is thought to be because of the combined action of unassembled DI genome ppp-RNA (whose ends can also form dsRNA panhandles intramolecularly) and to the overexpression of trailer ppp-ssRNA (26Strähle L. Marq J.B. Brini A. Hausmann S. Kolakofsky D. Garcin D. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 12227-12237Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). When the ability of E3L100–190 to prevent IFNβ activation induced by SeV DI-H4 infection was examined, we found that this dsRNA binding domain was also highly effective in inhibiting this activation. Moreover, this inhibitory activity was also lost in the mutant protein (K167A/R168A) unable to bind dsRNA (Fig. 1). We next examined whether the ability of E3L100–190 to efficiently inhibit DI-H4-induced IFNβ activation was due solely to its ability to bind dsRNA (and thereby prevent its interaction with PRRs such as RIG-I and mda-5) by comparing the ability of E3L100–190 to inhibit poly-I/C and 5′-ppp-ssRNA-induced IFNβ activation. At the same time we also examined the ability of E3L100–190 to inhibit dsDNA (poly(dA-dT):poly(dA-dT) or poly(dA-dT))-induced IFNβ activation, as E3L is known not to bind either ssRNA or dsDNA (28Ho C.K. Shuman S. Virology. 1996; 217: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have confirmed that E3L100–190 does not bind our ppp-ssRNA1 or poly(dA-dT) (data not shown). Other than cytoplasmic 5′-ppp-ssRNA and dsRNA that are recognized by RIG-I/mda-5 (and which signal via the mitochondrial membrane adapter IPS-1), cytoplasmic dsDNA is also recognized as a PAMP that activates IFNβ. Different synthetic dsDNAs are known to vary widely in their ability to stimulate an IFN response (8Ishii K.J. Coban C. Kato H. Takahashi K. Torii Y. Takeshita F. Ludwig H. Sutter G. Suzuki K.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9035-9040Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Poly(dA-dT) has by far the strongest effect on type I IFN expression, possibly because of its propensity to adopt different DNA conformations, including B-DNA and Z-DNA (30Vorlícková M. Kypr J. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1985; 3: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31Rich A. Nordheim A. Wang A.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 791-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). dsDNA is recognized in part by DAI in murine cells, which binds dsDNA, but the adapter through which the signaling occurs is unknown. As shown in Fig. 2, we unexpectedly found that coexpression of E3L100–190 strongly inhibited all three nucleic acid PAMP-induced IFNβ activations, whereas coexpression of mutant E3L100–190 was again unable to prevent any of the nucleic acid PAMP-induced IFNβ activations. To examine whether our 5′-ppp-ssRNA unexpectedly contained significant amounts of dsRNA character, we treated this RNA with RNase III or RNase A under conditions that are specific for the digestion of dsRNA or ssRNA, respectively, followed by PAGE. We found that our 5′-ppp-ssRNA was essentially resistant to RNase III digestion but entirely sensitive to RNase A digestion (Fig. 3). To ensure that dsDNA was responsible for the IFNβ activation, our poly(dA-dT) was treated with either RNase A plus RNase III or DNase I before transfection, and the effects of these treatments were controlled by PAGE (Fig. 4, bottom panel)). Poly-I/C was also transfected as a positive control. Both the level of IFNβ reporter gene (luciferase) activation and the presence of endogenous IFN released into the medium were then examined (Fig. 4). Our poly(dA-dT)-induced IFNβ reporter gene activation was sensitive to DNase treatment but resistant to RNase digestion, and the extent of IFNβ reporter gene activation in all cases correlated well with the anti-vesicular stomatitis virus activity (IFN) released into the medium.FIGURE 3Sensitivity of in vitro transcripts to RNase. The products of the ppp-RNA1 transcription reaction, which had been DNase-treated, phenol-extracted, and recovered from a preparative denaturing gel by ethanol precipitation were either left untreated (−) or digested with RNase III (III) or RNase A (A) under conditions that are specific for dsRNA and ssRNA, respectively (“Experimental Procedures”) as indicated. The RNAs were then further phenol-extracted and separated on a 10% sequencing gel. ssRNA size markers were run alongside (right lane).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Characterization of DNA-induced IFNβ activation. Poly(dA-dT) (10 μg) that was either untreated, mock (DNase)-treated, digested with RNase III plus RNase A or DNase I and transfected into MEFs that had previously been transfected with pIFNβ-(ff)luciferase and pTK-(ren)luciferase. A sample of these DNAs was examined by non-denaturing PAGE (bottom panel). Poly-I/C was also transfected as a positive control. Cell extracts were prepared 20 h later, and their luciferase activities were determined (top panel). 400 (1×) and 1600 μl (4×) samples of the culture media of these transfections were added to naïve MEFs for 12 h, which were then infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-GFP. After 121 h of incubation, the infected cells were harvested and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (middle panel) for GFP expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The expression of E3L by plasmid transfection has the added complication that additional dsDNA is simultaneously being introduced into the cytosol (at least during its transit to the nucleus). Moreover, the effects of its expression are examined in the absence of a viral infection, during which it normally functions. We, therefore, prepared rSeV that express WT E3L100–190 as a transgene and tested the ability of this protein expressed via SeV infection to inhibit poly(dA-dT)-induced IFNβ activation. As a neutral control, some cultures were infected with SeV-GFP. As shown in Fig. 5, the transgenic expression of E3L100–190 during SeV infection largely eliminated the poly(dA-dT)-induced IFNβ activation relative to that of the GFP control. Thus, the co-expression of E3L100–190 strongly inhibits 5′-ppp-ssRNA-, dsRNA-, and dsDNA-induced IFNβ activation independent of whether this protein domain can bind these nucleic acids. Nevertheless, the two residues most important for dsRNA binding are also critical for the ability of this domain to inhibit all three nucleic acid-induced cellular responses. Poly(dA-dT)-induced IFNβ activation occurs normally in RIG-I deficient MEFs (8Ishii K.J. Coban C. Kato H. Takahashi K. Torii Y. Takeshita F. Ludwig H. Sutter G. Suzuki K. Hemmi H. Sato S. Yamamoto M. Uematsu S. Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). In contrast, RIG-I appears to be required for this IFNβ activation in human Huh-7 hepatoma cells (29Cheng G. Zhong J. Chung J. Chisari F.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9035-9040Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As E3L100–190 expression is equally effective in inhibiting poly(dA-dT)-induced IFNβ activation in human HeLa and A549 cells (fig. 6), we examined whether RIG-I was required for this primary innate immune response in A549 cells. An A549 cell line in which RIG-I levels were strongly reduced was established by infecting these cells with a lentivirus expressing a micro RNA targeting the human RIG-I mRNA (RIG-I-KD) (Fig. 7). RIG-I levels were also restored in RIG-I-KD cells by plasmid transfection (pEBS-RIG-I; RIG-I-KI). When poly-I/C or poly(dA-dT) were transfected into RIG-I-KD versus control A549 cells, both double-stranded nucleic acids were considerably less effective in inducing IFNβ activation (Fig. 7B). In addition, the restoration of RIG-I to WT levels in the RIG-I-KD cells clearly restored the ability of both poly-I/C and poly(dA-dT) to induce IFNβ activation (RIG-I-KI; Fig. 7B). Thus, RIG-I is equally important for dsDNA- and dsRNA-induced IFNβ activation in human A549 cells, similar to Huh-7 cells. A similar approach showed that IRF3 was also required for poly(dA-dT)-induced IFNβ activation in A549 cells as expected (Fig. 7A). Notably, within the limits of this approach, RIG-I appeared to be as important as IRF3 in dsDNA-induced IFNβ activation.FIGURE 7RIG-I and IRF3 are required for DNA induced IFNβ activation in human A549 cells.

It is, therefore, not surprising that VV encodes a function(s) that interferes with the induction of the innate immune response by all three of these nucleic acid PAMPs. What is surprising is that all these activities are present in the dsRNA-BD of the E3L protein. The bifunctional VV E3L protein contains both a Z-DNA-BD at its N terminus (which to date has been found only on DAI, ADAR1, and PKZ (a pseudo-log of PKR)) (15Takaoka A. Taniguchi T. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2008; 60: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)) and a dsRNA-BD at its C terminus. Both these E3L nucleic acid binding domains contribute to viral pathogenesis in animal models and in cell culture at least in part by blocking the activation of cellular genes that respond to the viral infection (22Langland J.O. Kash J.C. Carter V. Thomas M.J. Katze M.G. Jacobs B.L. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 10083-10095Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It had been assumed that the ability to E3L to block IFNβ activation induced by cytosolic DNA was because of its Z-DNA-BD, which was thought to sequester cytoplasmic DNA and prevent its interaction with DAI and other DNA sensors (14Wang Z. Choi M.K. Ban T. Yanai H. Negishi H. Lu Y. Tamura T. Takaoka A. Nishikura K. Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5477-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), similar to the action of the E3L dsRNA-BD and dsRNA. Although this may be so, this report provides evidence that the dsRNA-BD alone, expressed either via plasmid transfection or transgenic SeV infection, can also prevent DNA-induced IFNβ activation. Specifically, we found that the co-expression of the dsRNA-BD of the vaccinia virus E3L protein (E3L100–190) strongly inhibits 5′-ppp-ssRNA-, dsRNA (poly-I/C)-, and dsDNA (poly(dA-dT))-induced IFNβ activation independent of whether this protein domain can bind these nucleic acids. Moreover, E3L100–190 is equally effective in cells of human and murine origin, where RIG-I is and is not, respectively, required for this DNA-induced activation. Equally surprising, the ability of E3L100–190 to inhibit these nucleic acid-induced IFNβ activations appears to depend in all cases on its ability to bind dsRNA. As neither RIG-I nor IPS-1 are apparently required for dsDNA-induced IFNβ activation in murine cells, whereas both these proteins appear to be required for this activation in human hepatoma cells, we have examined this requirement in another human cell line, A549, along with that of dsRNA (poly-I/C) as a positive control. We found that RNAi-induced reduction of RIG-I strongly reduced IFNβ activation by both double-stranded nucleic acids and that restoration of the RIG-I to WT levels clearly restored the activation by both dsRNA and dsDNA (Fig. 7). However, as RIG-I does not bind dsDNA and poly(dA-dT) is totally inactive in stimulating the ATPase activity of RIG-I in vitro (a good indicator of RIG-I signaling 3J.-B. Marq, S. Hausmann, J. Luban, D. Kolakofsky, and D. Garcin, unpublished data. ), the apparent requirement of RIG-I in dsDNA induced IFNβ activation remains unclear and may well be indirect. Perhaps the most baffling of our findings concerning E3L100–190 inhibition of both RNA- and DNA-induced innate immune responses is that in all cases two point mutations designed to specifically abrogate dsRNA binding (27Ho C.K. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2611-2614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also eliminated the activity of this domain in preventing 5′-ppp-ssRNA- and DNA-induced IFNβ activation (Fig. 4). Two possible explanations come to mind. The most obvious is that E3L100–190 interaction with its downstream signaling target requires its association with dsRNA. There may be an interesting precedent for this (32Romano P.R. Zhang F. Tan S.L. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Katze M.G. Dever T.E. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7304-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Expression of PKR in yeast is lethal as it inhibits protein synthesis by phosphorylating eIF2α. Remarkably, co-expression of E3L in yeast overcomes the lethal effect of PKR in a manner requiring the same two key residues (Lys-167 and Arg-168) needed for dsRNA binding by E3L. In yeast two-hybrid assays and in vitro protein binding experiments, segments of E3L and PKR containing their respective dsRNA-BDs interacted in a manner requiring E3L residues Lys-167 and Arg-168. Romano et al. (32Romano P.R. Zhang F. Tan S.L. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Katze M.G. Dever T.E. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7304-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) proposed that effective inhibition of PKR in yeast requires formation of an E3L-PKR-dsRNA complex. However, the source of the dsRNA here, as in the case of 5′-ppp-ssRNA- and DNA-induced IFNβ activation described above, remains unclear. dsRNA provides a platform on which various dsRNA binding proteins can interact with each other, and the binding of E3L to dsRNA greatly contributes to the stability of the E3L-PKR complex (32Romano P.R. Zhang F. Tan S.L. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Katze M.G. Dever T.E. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7304-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, it is also possible that E3L can form a complex with its downstream signaling target independent of the presence of dsRNA but, nevertheless, in a Lys-167/Arg-168-dependent manner. In this second case, E3L binding to dsRNA and the signaling target would presumably be mutually exclusive. The dsRNA binding motif is known to be a versatile macromolecular interaction platform that can in some cases also interact with DNA and proteins (for review, see Ref. 33Chang K.Y. Ramos A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2109-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). dsRNA-BDs are known to heterodimerize with other dsRNA-BDs and to also recognize structurally different protein targets. However, the nature of these dsRNA-BD protein-protein interactions is not well characterized, and it is not known whether Lys-167 and Arg-168 of E3L are essential here as well. Evidence has recently been provided that PKR facilitates the host innate immune response to viral infection by mediating IRF3 activation through the IPS-1 signal transduction pathway (34Zhang P. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34580-34587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). E3L100–190 can, thus, also act indirectly to prevent the host innate immune response by preventing PKR facilitation of IRF3 phosphorylation. It will be of interest to determine whether Lys-167 and Arg-168 of E3L are essential for any of its protein-protein interactions independent of dsRNA. Ablasser et al. have just reported that AT-rich dsDNA serves as a template for RNA polymerase III and is transcribed into 5′ ppp-dsRNA, which is then sensed by RIG-I to induce IFN. The existence of this dsDNA-sensing pathway provides a cogent explanation for how E3L(100–190) inhibits poly-(dA-dT)-induced IFNβ activation and why this inhibitory activity is lost when this E3L domain can no longer bind dsRNA."

We have shown previously that IL-12rb2 KO mice develop spontaneously lung adenocarcinomas or bronchioalveolar carcinomas. Aim of the study was to investigate i) IL-12Rβ2 expression in human primary lung adenocarcinomas and in their counterparts, i.e. normal bronchial epithelial cells (NBEC), ii) the direct anti-tumor activity of IL-12 on lung adenocarcinoma cells in vitro and vivo, and the mechanisms involved, and iii) IL-12 activity on NBEC. Methodology/Principal Findings Stage I lung adenocarcinomas showed significantly (P = 0.012) higher frequency of IL-12Rβ2 expressing samples than stage II/III tumors. IL-12 treatment of IL-12R+ neoplastic cells isolated from primary adenocarcinoma (n = 6) inhibited angiogenesis in vitro through down-regulation of different pro-angiogenic genes (e.g. IL-6, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and laminin-5), as assessed by chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and PCR array. In order to perform in vivo studies, the Calu6 NSCLC cell line was transfected with the IL-12RB2 containing plasmid (Calu6/β2). Similar to that observed in primary tumors, IL-12 treatment of Calu6/β2+ cells inhibited angiogenesis in vitro. Tumors formed by Calu6/β2 cells in SCID/NOD mice, inoculated subcutaneously or orthotopically, were significantly smaller following IL-12 vs PBS treatment due to inhibition of angiogenesis, and of IL-6 and VEGF-C production. Explanted tumors were studied by histology, immuno-histochemistry and PCR array. NBEC cells were isolated and cultured from lung specimens of non neoplastic origin. NBEC expressed IL-12R and released constitutively tumor promoting cytokines (e.g. IL-6 and CCL2). Treatment of NBEC with IL-12 down-regulated production of these cytokines. Conclusions This study demonstrates that IL-12 inhibits directly the growth of human lung adenocarcinoma and targets the adjacent NBEC. These novel anti-tumor activities of IL-12 add to the well known immune-modulatory properties of the cytokine and may provide a rational basis for the development of a clinical trial."
https://openalex.org/W2133751685,"Background Despite the large stocks of organic nitrogen in soil, nitrogen availability limits plant growth in many terrestrial ecosystems because most plants take up only inorganic nitrogen, not organic nitrogen. Although some vascular plants can assimilate organic nitrogen directly, only recently has organic nitrogen been found to contribute significantly to the nutrient budget of any plant. Carnivorous plants grow in extremely nutrient-poor environments and carnivory has evolved in these plants as an alternative pathway for obtaining nutrients. We tested if the carnivorous pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea could directly take up intact amino acids in the field and compared uptake of organic and inorganic forms of nitrogen across a gradient of nitrogen deposition. We hypothesized that the contribution of organic nitrogen to the nitrogen budget of the pitcher plant would decline with increasing nitrogen deposition. Methodology and Principal Findings At sites in Canada (low nitrogen deposition) and the United States (high nitrogen deposition), individual pitchers were fed two amino acids, glycine and phenylalanine, and inorganic nitrogen (as ammonium nitrate), individually and in mixture. Plants took up intact amino acids. Acquisition of each form of nitrogen provided in isolation exceeded uptake of the same form in mixture. At the high deposition site, uptake of organic nitrogen was higher than uptake of inorganic nitrogen. At the low deposition site, uptake of all three forms of nitrogen was similar. Completeness of the associated detritus-based food web that inhabits pitcher-plant leaves and breaks down captured prey had no effect on nitrogen uptake. Conclusions and Significance By taking up intact amino acids, Sarracenia purpurea can short-circuit the inorganic nitrogen cycle, thus minimizing potential bottlenecks in nitrogen availability that result from the plant's reliance for nitrogen mineralization on a seasonally reconstructed food web operating on infrequent and irregular prey capture."
https://openalex.org/W2168284706,"Pantothenate, a precursor of the fundamental enzyme cofactor coenzyme A (CoA), is essential for growth of the intraerythrocytic stage of human and avian malaria parasites. Avian malaria parasites have been reported to be incapable of de novo CoA synthesis and instead salvage CoA from the host erythrocyte; hence, pantothenate is required for CoA biosynthesis within the host cell and not the parasite itself. Whether the same is true of the intraerythrocytic stage of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, remained to be established. In this study we investigated the metabolic fate of [(14)C]pantothenate within uninfected and P. falciparum-infected human erythrocytes. We provide evidence consistent with normal human erythrocytes, unlike rat erythrocytes (which have been reported to possess an incomplete CoA biosynthesis pathway), being capable of CoA biosynthesis from pantothenate. We also show that CoA biosynthesis is substantially higher in P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes and that P. falciparum, unlike its avian counterpart, generates most of the CoA synthesized in the infected erythrocyte, presumably necessitated by insufficient CoA biosynthesis in the host erythrocyte. Our data raise the possibility that malaria parasites rationalize their biosynthetic activity depending on the capacity of their host cell to synthesize the metabolites they require."

In various cell lines and tissues, multiple human estrogen receptor α (hERα) mRNA isoforms are transcribed from distinct promoters and differ in their 5′-untranslated regions. Using PCR-based strategies, we show that in the human heart the ERα mRNA is transcribed from multiple promoters, namely, A, B, C, and F, of which the F-promoter is most frequently used variant. Transient transfection reporter assays in a human cardiac myocyte cell line (AC16) with F-promoter deletion constructs demonstrated a negative regulatory region within this promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that NF-κB binds to this region. An inhibition of NF-κB activity by parthenolide significantly increased the transcriptional activity of the F-promoter. Increasing NF-κB expression by tumor necrosis factor-α reduced the expression of ERα, indicating that the NF-κB pathway inhibits expression of ERα in human cardiomyocytes. Finally, 17β-estradiol induced the transcriptional activity of hERα promoters A, B, C, and F. In conclusion, inflammatory stimuli suppress hERα expression via activation and subsequent binding of NF-κB to the ERα F-promoter, and 17β-estradiol/hERα may antagonize the inhibitory effect of NF-κB.

The human ERα mRNA is transcribed from at least seven different promoters with unique 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTRs) (A, B, C, D, E, F, and T) (17Kos M. Reid G. Denger S. Gannon F. Mol.

All these ERα transcripts initiate at cap sites upstream of exon 1 and utilize a splice acceptor site at nucleotide +163 in the originally identified exon 1 (19Thompson D.A. McPherson L.A. Carmeci C. deConinck E.C. Weigel R.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These multiple promoters are utilized in a cell and tissue type-specific manner (20Grandien K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For example the predominant promoter variants utilized for the expression of the ERα gene are A and C promoters in the endometrium, C and F promoters in ovaries, and only F promoter variant in osteoblasts (12Flouriot G.

J. 2003; 372: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition to the differential promoter usage, it appears that there are a variety of cell/tissue-specific factors that interact with these various ERα promoters with trans-activating (AP1, ERBF-1, AP2) or trans-repressing functions, which also affect the regulation of the transcription of the ERα gene in a cell- and tissue- specific manner (22Schuur E.R.

Furthermore, it has been shown that E2 differentially regulates the levels of ERα in a cell type- and tissue type-specific manner. Although E2 down-regulates the level of ERα gene expression in MCF7 cells, it leads to an increase of ERα mRNA levels in other cell lines such as FEM-19 and ZR-75 and in tissues such as liver (12Flouriot G.

These findings suggested that the differential regulation of ERα gene expression by E2 in part is due to different promoter usage and/or transcription factors present within a cell (12Flouriot G.

To understand the molecular mechanisms controlling ERα gene expression in the human heart, we first report the characterization of the ERα promoter variants in the human left ventricular (LV) tissue and subsequently examine the molecular mechanism involved in the regulation of the most frequently utilized promoter variant. Finally, we study the effect of E2 and ERα itself on the transcriptional activity of the identified human ERα promoters. Human LV myocardial samples used in this study were composed of tissue samples of non-used donor hearts with originally normal systolic cardiac function, no history of cardiac disease, and normal postmortem histology. However, they did not qualify for transplantation at the time of organ harvesting because of functional reasons. All subjects were Caucasian. The study followed the rules of the Declaration of Helsinki. Total RNA from LV tissue of human hearts was isolated using the guanidinium isothiocyanate based method (RNAzolB, Friendswood) as previously described (5Nordmeyer J. Eder S. Mahmoodzadeh S. Martus P. Fielitz J. Bass J. Bethke N. Zurbrügg H.R. Pregla R. Hetzer R. Regitz-Zagrosek V. Circulation. 2004; 110: 3270-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To determine the 5′-UTRs of the ERα transcript in the human myocardium, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) was performed using a GenRacerTM kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The template for 5′-RACE was total RNA isolated from LV tissue of 5 human hearts (3 females and 2 males; age 55.8 ± 10.8). To increase the specificity and product yield of 5′-RACE, nested PCR was then performed using another internal gene-specific primer and geneRacer-nested primer. First strand synthesis of hERα cDNAs was carried out from isolated total RNA using a gene-specific primer, RV4 oligonucleotide, located in exon 2. Subsequently, for the amplification of cDNAs, we performed, first, hot-start PCR followed by nested PCR using the GenRacerTM 5′-primer and GenRacerTM 5′-nested primer as forward primer and the gene-specific primer RV1, RV2, RV3, and RV4 located in exon 1 or exon 2 of the ERα gene as the reverse primer (for primer sequences see supplemental Table 1). The PCR reactions were carried out under standard conditions. The 5′-RACE PCR products were subcloned into pCR®4-TOPO® vector using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) for subsequent DNA sequence analysis. Total RNA isolated from 14 human LV samples (7 females and 7 males; age: 50.9 ± 12) was used as the template for reverse transcriptase-PCR. cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng of total RNA from each sample using a random primer and a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit according to standard protocol (Applied Biosystems). PCRs were then carried out according to standard protocol using the following sense and antisense primers specific for each 5′-UTR variant of the hERα gene: A-variant, FW/RV; B-variant, FW/RV; C-variant, FW/RV; D-variant, FW/RV; E-variant, FW/RV; F-variant, FW/RV (for the primer sequences, see supplemental Table 1). The resulting PCR products were analyzed in 1% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Semiquantitative PCR was performed on a cDNA pool generated from the RNA of the same 14 human LV samples using primers specific for 5′-UTR A-, B-, C-, and F-variants according to standard protocols. PCR reactions were stopped after 28, 30, 32, 35, 38, and 40 cycles of amplification. The amplification of human β-actin gene was used as a reference gene for semiquantitative comparison. Equal aliquots of each PCR reaction were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Human genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral blood samples from healthy volunteers (n = 3) by using QIAamp DNA blood kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate the reporter construct containing the 5′-flanking region of the hERα F-variant, the sequence of the 5′-UTR F-variant and a part of coding exon 1 of the hERα gene (from +55 to +359 bp, relative to transcription start site; accession number U68068/AJ002562) (17Kos M. Reid G. Denger S. Gannon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2057-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) was fused to the −1,218/+83-bp fragment of hERα promoter F sequence (from −118,358 to −117,140 bp; upstream of the originally described transcription start site (17Kos M. Reid G. Denger S. Gannon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2057-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar)) using a splicing overlap extension method (SOE-PCR). The fragment +55/+359 bp, amplified with primer pairs FW-C1/RV-D1, was generated using human ERα cDNA as template, and the fragment −1218/+83 bp (relative to the transcription start site of F-variant), amplified with primer pairs FW-A1/RV-B1, was generated using human genomic DNA as template (see Fig. 1, also see supplemental Table 1). The primer RV-B1 was the reverse complement to the primer FW-C1. Amplified fragments were cloned into pCR®4-TOPO® and subsequently used as template for SOE-PCR amplification with primer pairs MluI site-linked FW-A1 and XhoI site-linked RV-D1. The resulting SOE-PCR fragment (referred herein and thereafter as full-length fragment F: −1218/+359 bp) was subcloned into a pCR®4-TOPO® vector using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). This sequence was then used as a template to prepare a series of deletion ERα F-variant DNA fragments (−910/+359 bp, −457/+359 bp, −910/−487 bp, and −910/−9 bp) by PCR (for primer binding sites see Fig. 1, FW-A6/RV-D1, FW-A5/RV-D1, FW-A6/RV-G4, FW-A6/RV-G1). Additionally, to generate reporter constructs containing the 5′-flanking region of hERα A-, hERα B-, and hERα C-transcript (−1019/+260 bp; −1303/−175 bp; −3215/−1859 bp respectively, relative to the originally identified transcription start site) (17Kos M. Reid G. Denger S. Gannon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2057-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), we performed PCR as described above (for the primer sequence see supplemental Table 1). The resulting sequences referred herein as to promoter variant A-, B-, and C- were then subcloned into the pCR®4-TOPO® vector. All constructs were verified by restriction site digestion and sequence analysis. Thereafter, luciferase reporter constructs were generated by using restriction sites MluI and XhoI; the resulting fragments were gel-purified and subcloned into promoterless pGl2-basic vector (Promega). The resulting luciferase reporter constructs are referred to as: A-promoter-pGL2, B-promoter-pGL2, C-promoter-pGL2, and F-promoter −pGL2. The different F-promoter constructs are as follows: −1218/+359-pGL2, −910/+359-pGL2, −457/+359-pGL2, −910/−487-pGL2, −910/−9-pGL2. QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used for generating mutants of potential transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) binding sites within the hERα F-promoter. The −910/−9-pGL2 reporter construct was used as a wild type construct. PCR oligonucleotide primer pairs used for generating mutants are listed in supplemental Table 1. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing. Deletion constructs are referred to as M1 (−910/−9)-pGL2 and M2 (−910/−9)-pGL2. AC16 cells (human cardiomyocyte cell line) (27Davidson M.M. Nesti C.

For stimulation experiments with E2 (10−8 mol/liter, Sigma), cells were cultured in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 2.5% charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum (CS-FBS, Biochrom AG), penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml, 100 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (0.25 μg/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 48 h. AC16 cells were treated with parthenolide (10 μmol/liter, Biomol) for 6 h and with ICI 182,780 (10−5 mol/liter, Tocris) 30 min before starting the E2 treatment. For stimulation experiments with TNFα, AC16 cells were cultured in normal medium with TNFα (10 ng/ml, R&D system) for 15 and 30 min. For the transient expression analysis of hERα promoter constructs, ∼1.5 × 105 cells/well were plated onto 6-well plates. After 24 h of incubation, promoter-luciferase reporter construct (1 μg) and the internal reference Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid phRL-TK vector (10 ng, Promega) were transfected to each well using FuGENE® 6 reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Diagnostics). For co-transfection experiments, 1 μg of each pSG-hERα66 vector (HEGO-vector, kindly donated by Dr. P. Chambon) or appropriate empty vector was used. After treatments, cell extracts were prepared, and Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were sequentially measured using the Dual-GloTM-Luciferase assay system (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions in a multilabel counter Victor3TM (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Variations in transfection efficiency were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. All transfections were carried out in triplicate for each construct and performed independently at least three times. Transfection results were averaged and are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Nuclear proteins from cultured (stimulated or non-stimulated) AC16 cells were extracted from cells grown in 100-mm culture plates. The AC16 cell pellets were resuspended in Nonidet P-40 containing saccharose buffer (for all buffers see supplemental Table 2). After centrifugation, the pellet was gently resuspended in a low salt buffer before the same volume of high salt buffer was gradually added in small aliquots to the cells. Afterward, the samples were incubated for 45 min at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. After centrifugation, the supernatant (nuclear proteins) was collected and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration of nuclear extracts was determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Five μg of nuclear protein or 50 μg of whole cell extract isolated from AC16 cells was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were immunoblotted overnight with antibodies against anti-NF-κB p50 (1:500; H-119, Santa Cruz) or anti-ERα (1:300, G-20, Sc-544; Santa Cruz) followed by incubation for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:10,000, Dianova). Nuclear-specific protein TFIID (TBP, N-12, Santa Cruz) or anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (Chemicon) was used for normalization. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with a chemiluminescent detection kit (ECLTM, GE Healthcare), and the density of protein bands were quantified by Alpha Ease FCTM software (Version 3.1.2, Alpha Innotech Corp.). AC16 cells were grown on eight-chamber culture slides (BD Bioscience) at a density of 30,000 cells/well. The cells were treated with or without NF-κB inhibitor, parthenolide (10 μmol/liter), for 6 h. Cells were fixed with 3% buffered formaldehyde (20 min), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 4 min), blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS (1 h), and then stained overnight with rabbit anti-NF-κB p50 polyclonal antibody (1:100, H-119, Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-ERα monoclonal antibody (1:50, ab2746, Abcam). Subsequently the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:100, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and Cy-3 conjugated goat F(ab′)2 Fragment anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h. The nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 10 min. Subsequently, slides were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium for fluorescence (H-1000, Vectashield, Vector Laboratories). Confocal images were acquired using a Leica TCS-SPE spectral laser scanning microscope, and images were processed by Leica Application Suite AF software (Version 1.8.0). For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, 5 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 2 μg poly(dI-dC) and 60,000 cpm radiolabeled oligonucleotide (5′-AACCTCATTAATCGGTAACAAGAAGTGCAGAGCGGGCT-3′, containing the putative binding site for NF-κB (Fig. 1), adjusted to 20 μl with a 5× binding buffer (for the buffer, see supplemental Table 2). For competition experiments, unlabeled oligonucleotides were added in a 100-fold molar excess to the reaction mixture before the addition of radiolabeled probe. For supershift assays, increasing amounts of antibody against NF-κB p50 (H-119, Santa Cruz) was added 30 min at 4 °C before the addition of the 32P-labeled probe. Each reaction was loaded on a native 5% polyacrylamide gel and run at 150 V for ∼2 h. After electrophoresis, gels were dried, exposed to imaging plates at −20 °C for up to 1 week, and visualized by autoradiography and quantified using phosphorimaging (GE Healthcare). All graphic representations and statistical analysis were accomplished using SPSS Program for windows (Version 13; SPSS, Inc.). Statistical comparisons between unpaired groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney test. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. A p value <0.05 was regarded as significant. To identify the alternative 5′-UTR usage in ERα transcripts in the human heart, we performed nested 5′-RACE, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sequence analysis of 41 positive clones demonstrated that 85.4% of these clones contained the 5′-UTR F-variant, 12.2% contained the C-variant, and 2.4% contained the B-variant. The existence of these three alternatives 5′-UTRs points to the presence of three alternative promoters of ERα in the human heart. Furthermore, this experiment suggests that the F-variant is the predominant promoter form of the ERα gene in the human myocardium, as a majority of the 5′-RACE clones were initiated by the promoter variant F (herein designated as F-promoter). To confirm the results obtained from 5′-RACE, we measured the relative abundance of the ERα transcripts containing different variants of the 5′-UTR by semiquantitative PCR. As shown in Fig. 2, the F-transcript exhibited the greatest abundance followed by C, B, and A transcripts. Additionally, 5′-UTR-specific PCR revealed that the transcript variants A, B, C, and F were present in all LV samples (data not shown). The 5′-UTR variants D and E were not detected in any tested sample. These findings suggest that the F-promoter is the most frequently utilized promoter in the basal transcription of the ERα gene in the human myocardium. To identify the regulatory elements controlling the expression of the ERα gene in the human heart, the activity of 1.2-kilobase pair F-promoter (full-length) and the deletion F-promoter fragments were investigated by luciferase reporter assay in AC16 cells. The full-length luciferase reporter construct (−1218/+359-pGL2) showed ∼4-fold promoter activity in comparison with the promoterless construct pGl2-basic (Fig. 3). Deletion of the region from −1218 to −911 bp to yield −910/+359-pGL2 decreased the promoter activity. These findings suggest that the region from −1218 to −910 bp contains an enhancer element(s) and/or the region from −910 to +359 bp contains a strong negative cis-acting element(s). To determine the region responsible for lowering the promoter activity, we generated two expression constructs, −910/−487-pGL2 and −457/+359-pGL2. Interestingly, both expression constructs showed a significant increase of luciferase activity, 6- and 12-fold, respectively (Fig. 3). Because the region from −486 to −458 bp is not present in both of these constructs, we therefore speculated that this region and most likely the adjacent sequences (from −490 to −440 bp) contain a negative cis-acting element(s) critical for the basal F-promoter activity in AC16 cells (Fig. 3, hatched column). Computer-assisted analysis (MatInspector 7.4.3./06, TESS (TRANSFAC Version 6.0) and Alibaba2.1) of the sequence from −490 to −440 bp showed several potential transcription factor binding sites, including NF-κB among others (Fig. 1). The functional significance of the NF-κB binding site to the hERα F-promoter was first investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation within the NF-κB binding sites (M2 (−910/−9)-pGL2) resulted in a significant increase of basal F-promoter activity in AC16 cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, no significant changes in luciferase activity were observed when the second putative NF-κB binding site, located downstream of the identified regulatory region, was mutated (M1 (−910/−9-pGL2)-pGL2). This experiment suggests that the NF-κB binding site located within the region −490 to −440 bp mediates the inhibition of the basal activity of hERα F-promoter. To confirm whether the NF-κB transcription factor binds within the region −490 to −440 bp, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift/supershift assays using nuclear extracts prepared from AC16 cells and synthetic oligonucleotides containing the NF-κB binding site. Three different DNA-protein complexes were formed (Fig. 5). These shifted bands could be competed by 100-fold molar excesses of the unlabeled oligonucleotide (Fig. 5). The addition of antibody against NF-κB p50 resulted in a supershifted band demonstrating the binding of the p50 subunit of the NF-κB transcription factor to its consensus sequence (Fig. 5). Taken together, the transcription factor NF-κB (p50) interacts with the ERα F-promoter. Most likely, NF-κB functions as a suppressor in the transcriptional regulation of the ERα gene in the human heart. In further experiments, we confirmed the inhibitory effect of NF-κB on the expression of ERα gene. The AC16 cells were transiently transfected with the −910/−9-pGL2 expression construct and treated with parthenolide, a well known inhibitor of NF-κB activation (28Hehner S.P. Heinrich M. Bork P.M. Vogt M. Ratter F. Lehmann V. Schulze-Osthoff K. Dröge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1288-1297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Parthenolide blocks the NF-κB activation by stabilizing its inhibitor IκB, resulting in cytoplasmic retention of NF-κB. The incubation of AC16 cells with parthenolide led to a significant increase of hERα F-promoter activity in comparison with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 6A). We conclude that NF-κB binding reduces the transcriptional activation of the hERα promoter. Furthermore, the amount of NF-κB p50 was significantly decreased in the nuclear extract of AC16 cells treated with parthenolide (Fig. 6B). Thus, the inhibition of translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus leads to an increase of hERα F-promoter activity in AC16 cells. To characterize more extensively the inhibitory role of NF-κB in the regulation of hERα gene, we examined the effects of an inhibition of NF-κB on the h"
https://openalex.org/W2137724004,"Fission yeast Atf1 is a member of the ATF/CREB basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family of transcription factors with strong homology to mammalian ATF2. Atf1 regulates transcription in response to stress stimuli and also plays a role in controlling heterochromatin formation and recombination. However, its DNA binding independent role is poorly studied. Here, we report that Atf1 has a distinct role in regulating the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitin ligase. We have identified atf1(+) as a dose-dependent suppressor of apc5-1, a mutation causing mitotic arrest. Remarkably, the suppression is not dependent upon the bZIP domain and is therefore independent of the ability of Atf1 to bind DNA. Interestingly, Atf1 physically binds the APC/C in vivo. Furthermore, we show that addition of purified Atf1 proteins into a cell-free system stimulates ubiquitylation of cyclin B and securin by the APC/C. These results reveal a novel role for Atf1 in cell cycle control through protein-protein interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1990374429,"Background A cost effective, safe and efficient method of obtaining DNA samples is essential in large scale genetic analyses. Buccal cells are an attractive source of DNA, as their collection is non-invasive and can be carried out by mail. However, little attention has been given to the quality of DNA extracted from mouthwashes. Methodology Mouthwash-derived DNA was extracted from 500 subjects participating in a genetic study of high myopia. DNA quality was investigated using two standard techniques: agarose gel electrophoresis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Principal Findings Whereas the majority of mouthwash-derived DNA samples showed a single band of high molecular weight DNA by gel electrophoresis, 8.9% (95% CI: 7.1–10.7%) of samples contained only a smear of low-to-medium molecular weight, degraded DNA. The odds of DNA degradation in a subject's second mouthwash sample, given degradation of the first, was significantly greater than one (OR = 3.13; 95% CI: 1.22–7.39; Fisher's test P = 0.009), suggesting that DNA degradation was at least partially a subject-specific phenomenon. Approximately 12.4% (95% CI: 10.4–14.4%) of mouthwash-derived DNA failed to PCR amplify efficiently (using an ∼200 bp microsatellite marker). However, we found there was no significant difference in amplification success rate between DNA samples judged to be degraded or non-degraded by gel electrophoresis (Fisher's test P = 0.5). Conclusions This study demonstrated that DNA degradation affects a significant minority of saline mouthwashes, and that the phenomenon is partially subject-specific. Whilst the level of degradation did not significantly prevent successful amplification of short PCR fragments, previous studies suggest that such DNA degradation would compromise more demanding applications."
https://openalex.org/W1982815464,"The intermediate filament (IF) protein nestin coassembles with vimentin and promotes the disassembly of these copolymers when vimentin is hyperphosphorylated during mitosis. The aim of this study is to determine the function of these nonfilamentous particles by identifying their interacting partners. In this study, we report that these disassembled vimentin/nestin complexes interact with insulin degrading enzyme (IDE). Both vimentin and nestin interact with IDE in vitro, but vimentin binds IDE with a higher affinity than nestin. Although the interaction between vimentin and IDE is enhanced by vimentin phosphorylation at Ser-55, the interaction between nestin and IDE is phosphorylation independent. Further analyses show that phosphorylated vimentin plays the dominant role in targeting IDE to the vimentin/nestin particles in vivo, while the requirement for nestin is related to its ability to promote vimentin IF disassembly. The binding of IDE to either nestin or phosphorylated vimentin regulates IDE activity differently, depending on the substrate. The insulin degradation activity of IDE is suppressed ̃50% by either nestin or phosphorylated vimentin, while the cleavage of bradykinin-mimetic peptide by IDE is increased 2- to 3-fold. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the nestin-mediated disassembly of vimentin IFs generates a structure capable of sequestering and modulating the activity of IDE.—Chou, Y.-H., Kuo, W.-L., Rich Rosner, M., Tang, W.-J., Goldman, R.

https://openalex.org/W2082633018,"In healthy cells, glutathione disulfide (GSSG) is rapidly reduced back to glutathione (GSH) by glutathione reductase to maintain redox status. The ratio of GSH/GSSG has been used as an indicator of oxidative stress. However, hypochlorous acid (HOCl) generated by the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl− system of neutrophils converts GSH to irreversible oxidation products. Although several such products have been identified, yields of these compounds are very low in biological systems, and they cannot account quantitatively for thiol loss. In the current studies, we use liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to demonstrate that HOCl and chloramines oxidize GSSG to two irreversible products in high yield. The products, termed M-45 and M-90, are, respectively, 45 or 90 atomic mass units lighter than GSSG. The reaction pathway involves chloramine and aldehyde intermediates, and converts the γ-glutamyl residues of GSSG to 5-hydroxybutyrolactam. Importantly, M-45 and M-90 were resistant to reduction by glutathione reductase. Moreover, the monohydroxylbutyrolactam M-45 accounted for >90% of the endogenous GSH oxidation products generated by activated neutrophils. Because the reaction pathway involves chlorinating intermediates, hydroxylbutyrolactams are likely to be specific products of HOCl, which is generated only by myeloperoxidase.

As a nucleophilic scavenger, GSH can directly react with electrophilic substances, such as reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, or be oxidized by GSH peroxidase to glutathione disulfide (GSSG). Therefore, it is essential for maintaining intracellular redox status and defending against oxidative injury. Under normal circumstances, GSSG is rapidly reduced back to GSH by glutathione reductase and NADPH. Thus, most of the GSH remains in the reduced form. Under oxidative stress, however, GSH is converted to GSSG, which potentially accumulates (2Wu G. Fang Y.Z. Yang S. Lupton J.R. Turner N.D. J.

HOCl generates other products in addition to GSSG when it reacts with GSH. Chesney et al. (20Chesney J.A. Eaton J.W. Mahoney Jr., J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2131-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) suggested that it oxidizes GSH to a higher oxidation state than the disulfide form because the molar ratio of HOCl consumed to GSH oxidized was 4:1 instead of 1:1 in Escherichia coli. Winterbourn (21Winterbourn C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 840: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) reported that approximately half of the GSH oxidized by HOCl could not be regenerated. These researchers have identified glutathione sulfonamide (GSA), glutathione thiosulfonate, and dehydroglutathione as irreversible higher oxidation products (22Winterbourn C.C. Brennan S.O. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 23Harwood D.T. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Their observations suggest that the formation of higher order GSSG oxidation products might account in part for the irreversible loss of GSH induced by HOCl. However, activated neutrophils (the source of MPO and therefore of HOCl) generate only low yields of these higher oxidation products, suggesting that the major products of GSH oxidation by MPO remain to be identified. The disulfide and α-amino groups of GSSG are also potential targets of HOCl (17Pattison D.I. Davies M.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 1453-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Disulfides can be oxidized to sulfonic acid via a sulfenyl chloride intermediate (16Hawkins C.L. Pattison D.I. Davies M.J. Amino Acids. 2003; 25: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). α-Amino groups yield chloramines, which undergo decarboxylation, intramolecular H-abstraction, or other reaction pathways to form various products, such as aldehydes and carboxymethyllysine (16Hawkins C.L.

These reactions may be biologically relevant, because carboxymethyllysine production is impaired in mice deficient in the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (25Anderson M.M. Heinecke J.W. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that GSSG is a potential scavenger of HOCl. Indeed, GSSG reportedly competes for HOCl with its rate constant expected to be 2 × 105 m−1 s−1 (26Prütz W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 27Pattison D.I. Davies M.J. Curr. Med. Chem. 2006; 13: 3271-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar).

Chem. 2002; 383: 709-713PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that GSSG protects acetylcholinesterase from oxidative inactivation by HOCl. Nagy and Ashby (29Nagy P. Ashby M.T. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2007; 20: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) studied the kinetics and mechanism of GSSG oxidation by HOCl. They proposed that HOCl generates the bis-N-chloro-γ-l-glutamyl derivative of GSSG. These studies suggest that GSSG itself may function as an antioxidant. In the current study, we investigated the reaction of GSSG with HOCl and other oxidants. Using liquid chromatography in concert with mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we identified two groups of novel oxidation products, which we termed M-45 and M-90. We characterized their structures and potential reaction pathways. Our results indicate that HOCl and chloramines oxidize the γ-glutamyl moiety of GSSG to 5-hydroxybutyrolactam in high yield. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), trifluoroacetic acid, and HPLC grade acetonitrile (CH3CN) were purchased from Fisher Scientific. Oxidized glutathione (GSSG), glutathione (GSH), dithiothreitol, sodium borohydride (NaBH4), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), formic acid, N-α-acetyl-l-lysine, NADPH, glutathione reductase from bakers' yeast, and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) were obtained from Sigma. Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) was purchased from Invitrogen. 2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) was purchased from Spectrum Chemical Manufacturing Corp. (Gardena, CA). Concentrations of NaOCl (ϵ292 = 350 m−1 cm−1) (30Morris J.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1966; 70: 3798-3805Crossref Scopus (812) Google Scholar) and H2O2 (ϵ240 = 39.4 m−1 cm−1) (31Nelson D.P. Kiesow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar) were determined spectrophotometrically. N-Chloramine was freshly prepared by chlorinating N-α-acetyl-lysine. Briefly, N-α-acetyl-lysine (5.5 mm) was incubated with sodium hypochloride (5 mm) on ice in phosphate buffer (25 mm, pH 7.4) for 10 min. The formation of N-α-acetyl-lysine chloramine was determined by measuring absorption at 252 nm (ϵ252 = 429 m−1 cm−1) (32Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite was synthesized by incubating acidified hydrogen peroxide with a nitrite solution and stabilizing the resulting peroxynitrous acid by rapidly quenching the reaction with excess sodium hydroxide (33Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6718) Google Scholar). The concentration of peroxynitrite was determined by measuring absorption at 302 nm (ϵ252 = 1670 m−1 cm−1) (34Hughes M.N. Nicklin H.G. J. Chem. Soc. A. 1968; 2: 450-452Crossref Google Scholar). GSSG (20 μm) was incubated with different concentrations of HOCl or other oxidants in phosphate buffer (25 mm, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 1 h. Methionine (1:10, mol/mol, oxidant/Met) was added to terminate the oxidation reactions. LC-MS analyses were performed in positive ion mode with a Finnigan Mat LCQ XP Plus ion trap mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA) coupled to an Agilent 1100 HPLC (Palo Alto, CA). Reaction mixtures were separated on a C18 small pore column (2.1 × 250 mm, Vydac, Deerfield, IL) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, using 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in H2O as solvent A and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile as solvent B. GSSG and its oxidation products were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–30% solvent B over 30 min. The collision energy for MS/MS was 35%. The temperature of the heated capillary was 220 °C. The collected oxidation products of GSSG were reconstituted in deuterium oxide, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and then diluted 1:1 with 50% CH3CN (v/v) in deuterium oxide containing 0.5% (v/v) formic acid (35Fu X. Kao J.L. Bergt C. Kassim S.Y. Huq N.P. d'Avignon A. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6209-6212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). They were analyzed by MS. M-45 and M-90 were purified by HPLC. Their 1H NMR spectra were taken with an AV-300 Brucker NMR spectrometer (Brucker Optics, Inc., Fremont, CA) at 300 MHz, using deuterium oxide (D2O) as the solvent. The 1H chemical shifts (ppm) were referenced to solvent (D2O, δ = 4.811 ppm). GSSG, M-45, or M-90 (20 μm) were added to 22 nm glutathione reductase in phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA. After a 5-min incubation, the reaction was initiated by adding 500 μm NADPH. After 10 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 20% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid to reach pH 2. The reaction mixture was then filtered through a 3-kDa cutoff spin filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to remove the macromolecular components. The resulting mixtures were collected for LC-MS analysis. Mixtures without NADPH were used as controls. Twenty micromolar GSSG, M-45, or M-90 were added to a reaction mixture containing 22 nm glutathione reductase, 570 μm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and 1 mm EDTA in phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.5). After a 5-min incubation, the reaction was initiated by adding 500 μm NADPH. Substrate reduction was determined indirectly by monitoring the increase in absorbance of 5-thio(2-nitrobenzoic acid) at 412 nm. The absorbance readings were recorded in a kinetic mode every 15 s for 10 min by Spectramax 190 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Neutrophils were isolated from EDTA-anticoagulated blood by buoyant density centrifugation, using Polymorph-Prep (Nycomed, Sunnyvale, CA). The neutrophils were washed twice by centrifugation with HBSS buffer (pH 7.4, magnesium-, calcium-, phenol-, and bicarbonate-free) containing 100 μm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid to inhibit metal-catalyzed reactions. After centrifugation, the neutrophils were resuspended in HBSS buffer and used immediately for reactions. They were activated with 200 nm PMA in the presence or absence of catalase (50 μg/ml), methionine (2 mm), or sodium azide (2 mm). Reactions were terminated by adding methionine (final, 1 mm). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation. Supernatants were filtered through a 3-kDa cutoff spin filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to remove the macromolecular components. The resulting supernatant was collected for LC-MS analysis. To search for higher oxidation products of GSSG, we exposed the disulfide to different concentrations of HOCl at pH 7.4, and analyzed the reaction mixture with LC-ESI-MS. At a 1:1 molar ratio of GSSG/HOCl, GSSG was almost quantitatively converted to two major groups of products (Fig. 1, peaks 1 and 2 and peaks 3–5). When the molar ratio was 2:1, the GSSG peak disappeared, peaks 1 and 2 dramatically decreased, and peaks 3–5 increased markedly. These observations suggest that peaks 3–5 represent higher oxidation products of peaks 1 and 2. The retention times of all oxidation products were longer than that of GSSG, indicating greater hydrophobicity. Thus, oxidation may have deleted one or more hydrophilic groups from GSSG. LC-MS demonstrated that peaks 1 and 2 had the same molecular mass (Fig. 2C, m/z 568.0, singly charged), suggesting they were isomers. Detection of an ion of m/z 550.1 indicated that both compounds could easily lose one molecule of water. MS/MS analysis of the m/z 550.1 ion revealed that peaks 1 and 2 had identical mass spectra, with major fragment ions of m/z 421.0, 346.0, and 177.0 (Fig. 2D), again suggesting the presence of isomers. Because identical masses were 45 atomic mass units less than that of GSSG, we called the isomers M-45. Similar results were obtained from MS and MS/MS analyses of peaks 3–5. All three peaks shared the same molecular mass (Fig. 2E, m/z 522.8) and identical MS/MS spectra, with major fragment ions of m/z 411.7, 383.9, and 242.9 (Fig. 2F). Detection of m/z 504.8 ([M-H2O + H]+) and 486.9 ([M-2H2O + H]+) (Fig. 2E) indicated that these products readily lost water during mass analysis. These observations suggest that peaks 3, 4, and 5 were isomers with a molecular mass of 90 atomic mass units less than that of the precursor, GSSG. We named these isomeric species M-90. GSSG exhibited both singly and doubly charged ions of m/z 613.1 and 307.3, respectively (Fig. 2A). However, only singly charged ions were detected from the oxidation products, suggesting the loss of an amino group. MS/MS analysis of M-45 revealed a major fragment ion of m/z 421.0, which had a mass shift of 129 atomic mass units from the dehydrated product of M-45 (m/z 550.1). The material with this 129-atomic mass unit loss is a well known fragment of GSH and its conjugates; it corresponds to the loss of pyroglutamic acid from the γ-glutamyl residue. Further loss of the glycine residue formed a fragment ion of m/z 346.0. A fragment ion of m/z 177.0 represented the remaining cysteine and glycine residues. These results indicated that M-45 had retained one GSH moiety and that the missing 45 atomic mass units was lost from the carboxyl group of one γ-glutamyl residue of GSSG. Hence, we hypothesize that HOCl attacks the amino group of glutamic acid to form a chloramine, which further undergoes decarboxylation and imine hydrolysis to become the aldehyde via the Grob fragmentation pathway (16Hawkins C.L. Pattison D.I. Davies M.J. Amino Acids. 2003; 25: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 23Harwood D.T. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4997-5005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, M-45 is possibly an aldehyde that is formed by converting the -CH(NH2)COOH group of one of the GSSG glutamyl residues into -CHO. Because GSSG has a symmetric structure and oxidation product M-90 differed from M-45 by 45 atomic mass units, we propose that M-90 resulted from decarboxylation of the remaining glutamyl residue in M-45. To determine whether M-45 and M-90 might contain aldehyde groups, we exposed each product to sodium borohydride, which selectively converts ketones and aldehydes to alcohols (Fig. 3). Using LC-MS, we detected two peaks of m/z 570.2 (M-45 + 2H) and 527.1 (M-90 + 4H), suggesting that the aldehyde groups in M-45 and M-90 had been reduced to alcohol, increasing the mass by 2 or 4 units, respectively (Fig. 3, B1 and C1). MS/MS analyses of m/z 570.2 and 527.1 revealed the loss of γ-butyrolactone from the alcohol ends of M-45 and M-90 (Fig. 3, B2 and C2). These observations demonstrated that sodium borohydride reduced M-45 and M-90 to their corresponding alcohols, which is consistent with our hypothesis that M-45 and M-90 are aldehydes. To further characterize the structures of M-45 and M-90, we treated each product with DNPH, a reagent widely used to selectively derivatize aldehydes or ketones (37Andreoli R. Manini P. Corradi M. Mutti A. Niessen W.M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 17: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). LC-MS detected two additional peaks, with m/z 748.1 (M-45 + 180) and 685.0 (M-90 + 180-H2O), after DNPH treatment, indicating the formation of DNPH adducts in each case (Fig. 3, D1 and E1). MS/MS analysis of m/z 748.1 and 685.0 confirmed that DNPH formed adducts with both products through their aldehyde groups (Fig. 3, D2 and E2). Collectively, our results provide strong evidence that both products are aldehydes. To confirm our observations, we analyzed purified M-45 and M-90 with 1H NMR. Surprisingly, we were unable to detect any aldehydic protons (chemical shift between 9–10 ppm), suggesting that both products assume a ring conformation after an amide nitrogen is added to the Cys residue adjacent to the carbonyl group (Scheme 1). Based on the spectra of similar compounds, the 1H NMR chemical shifts (Table 1) were consistent with the proposed 5-hydroxybutyrolactam structure (29Nagy P. Ashby M.T. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2007; 20: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 38Harwood D.T. Nimmo S.L. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Ashby M.T. Chem. Res.

Disappearance of Glu α, β, and γ protons in the NMR spectrum of M-90 indicated that both Glu groups in GSSG had been modified. The chemical shifts of two β protons in the 5-hydroxybutyrolactam moiety differed from each other due to the chiral center that was created. One was shifted downfield to around 2.5 ppm, and the other was shifted upfield to 1.8 ppm. The chemical shift of the α proton of 5-hydroxybutyrolactam was shifted further downfield to 5.3 ppm due to the deshielding effect of the hydroxyl group that is attached to the same carbon.TABLE 11H NMR chemical shifts (ppm) of M-45 and M-90 at 300 MHzTABLE 11H NMR chemical shifts (ppm) of M-45 and M-90 at 300 MHz We used D/H exchange to determine the number of exchangeable hydrogens in M-45 and M-90. MS analysis indicated that M-45 contained 9 exchangeable hydrogens compared with 12 exchangeable hydrogens in GSSG (4 amide bond hydrogens, 4 amino hydrogens, and 4 hydrogens on the carboxyl groups). The absence of 2 amino hydrogens and 1 carboxyl hydrogen on the glutamyl residue explains why M-45 incorporated 3 fewer deuterium atoms than GSSG (Scheme 1). Dehydrated M-45 had 8 exchangeable hydrogens. Dehydrated M-90 incorporated 4 deuterium atoms, including 2 amide bond hydrogens and 2 hydrogens on the carboxyl groups of glycine residues. These observations confirmed the proposed structures of M-45 and M-90. To determine whether other oxidants convert GSSG to M-45 or M-90, we incubated GSSG with different concentrations of peroxynitrite (ONOO−), H2O2, or chloramine (generated by the reaction of N-α-acetyl-lysine with HOCl). Neither M-45 nor M-90 were detected when GSSG was treated with up to a 50-fold molar excess of peroxynitrite or H2O2 (data not shown). In contrast, we detected M-45 after exposing GSSG to a 50-fold molar excess of chloramine. Thus, only reactive chlorinating intermediates were able to generate M-45 and M-90. We used LC-MS to derive a progress curve and product yields of GSSG oxidation by HOCl or chloramine. All reactions were carried out at 37 °C in phosphate buffer (25 mm, pH 7.4). As shown in Fig. 4A, GSSG reacted rapidly with HOCl. A 10-min exposure of 10 μm GSSG to a 1:1 molar ratio of HOCl converted ∼50% of GSSG to M-45. A 30-min incubation produced M-90 with a 15% yield. We then exposed GSSG to different amounts of HOCl (Fig. 4B). The yield of each product was dependent on the HOCl/GSSG molar ratio. M-45 production peaked at a molar ratio of 1:1. As the ratio increased, the yield of M-45 decreased significantly, whereas the percentage of M-90 increased dramatically, indicating that M-45 may be further oxidized to M-90 when the concentration of HOCl is high. We also detected a low level of GSA (Fig. 4B), which has been reported as an oxidation product of GSH by HOCl (22Winterbourn C.C. Brennan S.O. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 23Harwood D.T. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 41Pullar J.M. Vissers M.C. Winterbourn C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22120-22125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Next, we measured the levels of GSSG oxidation products generated by chloramine, using a chloramine/GSSG molar ratio up to 100. High chloramine concentrations generated M-45 as the major product and M-90 as a minor product (Fig. 4D). However, chloramine reacted much more slowly than HOCl (Fig. 4C). Collectively, these observations indicate that HOCl rapidly converts the γ-glutamyl(s) in GSSG to a high yield of mono- or di-5-hydroxybutyrolactam (M-45 or M-90) and chloramine derived from HOCl generates the same products, although in lower yields, suggesting that these reactions could occur in vivo at sites of inflammation. Under normal physiological conditions, glutathione reductase rapidly reduces GSSG back to GSH to maintain the normal redox status. To test if glutathione reductase can reduce M-45 or M-90, we incubated 20 μm of each substrate with the enzyme for 10 min in the presence of NADPH. After macromolecules were removed, the reaction mixture was analyzed by LC-MS. As shown in Fig. 5, GSSG was completely reduced to GSH by 10 min. However, M-45 and M-90 remained almost unchanged. These observations indicate that M-45 and M-90 are very poor substrates for glutathione reductase. We further compared the kinetics of M-45, M-90, and GSSG reduction by glutathione reductase, using the 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) assay (Fig. 6A). When the initial concentration of each substrate was 20 μm, GSSG was reduced very rapidly. In contrast, the reduction rates of M-45 and M-90 were reduced to 1.7 and 0.4% of that of GSSG (Fig. 6B), indicating that the products are resistant to glutathione reductase reduction. This would be expected to permanently deplete the store of GSSG and disrupt GSH recycling, thereby exacerbating oxidative stress in vivo.FIGURE 6Time course of GSSG, M-45, and M-90 reduction catalyzed by glutathione reductase. 20 μm GSSG, M-45, or M-90 were added to a reaction mixture containing 22 nm glutathione reductase and 570 μm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA. After a 5-min incubation, the reaction was initiated by adding 500 μm NADPH. Absorbance at 412 nm was recorded for 5-thio(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in a kinetic mode every 15 s for 2 min, using a plate reader. The results are expressed as mean ± S.D. from 3 experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the HOCl that is generated by human neutrophils can oxidize GSSG, we incubated the disulfide (5 μm) with human neutrophils (1 × 106/ml) at 37 °C in HBSS, activated the cells with PMA, and analyzed the supernatant with LC-MS (Fig. 7). Under these conditions, nearly 70% of the GSSG was converted to M-45 and M-90. Generation of M-45 and M-90 required cellular activation. Interestingly, we were able to detect a small amount of M-45 in the supernatant from activated human neutrophils that had not received exogenous GSSG, suggesting that activated neutrophils oxidize endogenous GSSG. Neutrophils secrete GSH and GSSG, and activated neutrophils also release MPO, the only enzyme known to generate HOCl in humans. Thus, M-45 generated by endogenous GSSG and MPO might be an indicator of neutrophil activation. To determine whether HOCl produced by MPO oxidizes endogenous GSSG to M-45 or M-90, we exposed human neutrophils (5 × 106/ml) to phorbol ester in the absence or presence of catalase, methionine, or sodium azide. LC-MS/MS with selective reaction monitoring demonstrated that M-45 formation required cell activation and was inhibited by the H2O2 scavenger catalase, the thiol-containing antioxidant methionine, or the heme poison sodium azide (Fig. 8). We used selective reaction monitoring to quantify the relative abundance of GSH, GSSG, M-45, and M-90 in human neutrophils with or without PMA treatment (Fig. 9). As expected, most of the GSH secreted from inactivated neutrophils remained in its reduced form. However, GSH was not detectable in supernatant from activated neutrophils, whereas we detected M-45 as a major oxidation product, which accounted for >90% of the total products quantified by peak area. These results suggest that HOCl generated by the MPO system of activated human neutrophils initially oxidizes the GSH that is secreted from neutrophils to GSSG. The disulfide is then further oxidized to M-45. We failed to detect M-90 in the supernatant of activated human neutrophils. Collectively, these results indicate that activated neutrophils use MPO to convert endogenous secreted GSH and GSSG to M-45 at high yield, suggesting M-45 could be a useful indicator of neutrophil activation or a biomarker for HOCl oxidation in vivo.FIGURE 9Quantification of GSH, GSSG, and M-45 produced by activated human neutrophils. The experimental conditions were the same as described in the legend to Fig. 6. Relative intensity of GSH, GSSG, and M-45 were determined by dividing the peak area of the compound of interest by the sum of all the detected peaks. The peak area was determined by LC-MS/MS, using the selective reaction monitoring mode (GSH, m/z 308.1 → 179.0; GSSG, m/z 307.5 → 484.0; M-45, m/z 568.1 → 550.1). Results are mean ± S.D. from 3 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We demonstrated that HOCl specifically converts the γ-glutamyl groups of GSSG to two sets of isomeric oxidation products, M-45 and M-90, in high yield. At a 1:2 molar ratio of GSSG/HOCl, GSSG was completely converted to M-45 and M-90. Analysis of the reaction kinetics and the product yields at various molar ratios of oxidant strongly suggested that M-45 was the initial oxidation product. This isomer mixture was in turn oxidized to M-90. Reduction with borohydride and derivatization with DNPH provided strong evidence that both M-45 and M-90 contain aldehyde groups. Thus, we hypothesized that M-45 and M-90 were generated after HOCl converted the γ-glutamyl residue of GSSG into chloramines, which then initiated the Grob fragmentation pathway to generate aldehyde (16Hawkins C.L. Pattison D.I. Davies M.J. Amino Acids. 2003; 25: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 36Hazen S.L. d'Avignon A. Anderson M.M. Hsu F.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4997-5005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, no aldehyde H was detected by NMR, suggesting that the aldehyde groups in M-45 or M-90 had formed the cyclic carbinolamine derivative. Detection of multiple isomers (relative ratios were 1:1 for M-45 and 1:2:1 for M-90) indicated the formation of diastereoisomers resulting from the new chiral centers in the products. Furthermore, when we isolated each isomer of M-45, incubated it at pH 7.4, and analyzed the reaction mixture with LC-MS, we detected two isomers of M-45, indicating that they are likely to be in equilibrium. Based on these observations, we propose that HOCl oxidizes GSSG by the pathway shown in Scheme 1. The amino group in the Glu residue is first chlorinated by HOCl. Due to the electron withdrawing effect of Cl, the terminal -COOH on Glu is decarboxylated to the imine (42Queralt J.J. Andres J. Canle L.M. Cobas J.H. Santaballa J.A. Sambrano J.R. Chem. Phys. 2002; 280: 1-14Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The unstable imine is further hydrolyzed to an aldehyde, which is then converted to 5-hydroxybutyrolactam through nucleophilic addition to the amide nitrogen of the adjacent Cys residue. The proposed reaction pathway implies that M-45 exists as an equilibrium mixture of the aldehyde and butyrolactam ring. As with glucose, however, in which 99% of the molecules are closed rings, the predominant species of M-45 is 5-hydroxybutyrolactam. This explains the failure to detect an aldehydic proton in M-45 by NMR. Our NMR results are also consistent with the proposed ring structures of M-45 and M-90. Nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl group in M-45 creates a chiral center during the formation of the butyrolactam ring, resulting in a 1:1 ratio of two diastereoisomers (Scheme 2). Because both Glu residues of GSSG become 5-hydroxybutyrolactam in M-90, we detected three isomeric peaks with a ratio of 1:2:1. When M-90 reacted with DNPH, one aldehyde group was conjugated with DNPH. Because only the remaining aldehyde group could be converted to 5-hydroxybutyrolactam, we detected two isomeric peaks for DNPH adducts of M-90. Irreversible oxidation of GSSG to butyrolactam (M-45) and bis-butyrolactam (M-90) derivatives would explain the lack of detectable GSSG formation observed in previous studies of GSH oxidation by neutrophils (43Roum J.H.

Biophys. 1994; 310: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Our observations indicate that M-45 and M-90 are resistant to reduction by glutathione reductase. The formation of these irreversible oxidation products would disrupt GSH recycling, lowering its antioxidant capacity. Therefore, oxidation of GSSG may contribute to thiol loss and local GSH depletion. The GSH/GSSG ratio has been used as an indicator of oxidative stress in vivo. However, HOCl generated by activated phagocytes during inflammation may further oxidize GSSG to M-45, increasing the GSH/GSSG ratio. Thus the observed GSH/GSSG ratio may not reflect the actual level of oxidative stress in vivo. In contrast, M-45, which appears stable under our experimental conditions, could be a specific biomarker of oxidative stress during inflammation. We also examined whether HOCl converts GSSG to GSA, which has been reported to be a significant oxidation product of GSH by HOCl (23Harwood D.T. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 38Harwood D.T. Nimmo S.L. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Ashby M.T. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2008; 21: 1011-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We found that GSA was only a minor product at high molar ratios of HOCl, accounting for ∼10% of the total products at a 3:1 ratio of HOCl/GSSG. However, our studies of oxidation of endogenous GSH/GSSG by activated neutrophils indicated that the yield of GSA in biological systems could be much lower (<4%, data not shown) than that of M-45 (>90%, Fig. 9). Moreover, long-lived chloramines derived from HOCl oxidized GSH to GSSG and M-45 but not to GSA (data not shown). M-45 therefore could be a sensitive and specific biomarker of HOCl oxidation in vivo. In conclusion, we demonstrated that HOCl, which is generated only by MPO in humans, oxidized the γ-glutamyl group in GSSG to a novel irreversible product, 5-hydroxybutyrolactam, in high yield, hampering thiol regeneration during oxidative stress. Most importantly, we detected this product from activated neutrophils, suggesting that the HOCl generated by these cells may oxidize GSSG at sites of inflammation. This in turn suggests that M-45, the 5-hydroxybutyrolactam derivative of GSSG, may be a potential marker for neutrophil activation in vivo.

Little is known about the cellular immune responses elicited by this parasite in humans. We used multiparameter flow cytometry to characterize leukocyte immunophenotypes in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 33 HAT patients and 27 healthy controls identified during a screening campaign in Angola and Gabon. We evaluated the subsets and activation markers of B and T lymphocytes. Patients had a higher percentage of CD19+ B lymphocytes and activated B lymphocytes in the blood than did controls, but lacked activated CD4+ T lymphocytes (CD25+). Patients displayed no increase in the percentage of activated CD8+ T cells (HLA-DR+, CD69+ or CD25+), but memory CD8 T-cell levels (CD8+CD45RA−) were significantly lower in patients than in controls, as were effector CD8 T-cell levels (CD8+CD45RA+CD62L−). No relationship was found between these blood immunophenotypes and disease severity (stage 1 vs 2). However, CD19+ B-cell levels in the CSF increased with disease severity. The patterns of T and B cell activation in HAT patients suggest that immunomodulatory mechanisms may operate during infection. Determinations of CD19+ B-cell levels in the CSF could improve disease staging."

https://openalex.org/W2013616393,"Mutation screens in model organisms have helped identify the foundation of many fundamental organismal phenotypes. An emerging question in evolutionary and behavioral biology is the extent to which these ""developmental"" genes contribute to the subtle individual variation that characterizes natural populations. A related question is whether individual differences arise from static differences in gene expression that arose during previous life stages, or whether they are due to dynamic regulation of expression during the life stage under investigation. Here, we address these questions using genes that have been discovered to control the development of normal courtship behavior in male Drosophila melanogaster. We examined whether these genes have static or dynamic expression in the heads of adult male flies of different ages and with different levels of social experience. We found that 16 genes of the 25 genes examined were statically expressed, and 9 genes were dynamically expressed with changes related to adult age. No genes exhibited rapid dynamic expression changes due to social experience or age*experience interaction. We therefore conclude that a majority of fly ""courtship"" genes are statically expressed, while a minority are regulated in adults with respect to age, but not with respect to relevant social experience. These results are consistent with those from a recent microarray analysis that found none of the canonical courtship genes changed expression in male flies after brief exposure to females."
https://openalex.org/W2043126181,"Human I-mfa domain containing protein (HIC) differentially regulates transcription from viral promoters. HIC affects the Wnt pathway, the JNK/SAPK pathway and the activity of positive transcription elongation factor-b (P-TEFb). Studies exploring HIC function in mammalian cells used ectopically expressed HIC due to undetected endogenous HIC protein. HIC mRNA contains exceptionally long 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) compared to the average length of mRNA UTRs. Here we show that HIC protein is subject to strict repression at multiple levels. The HIC mRNA UTRs reduce the expression of HIC or of a reporter protein: The HIC 3′-UTR decreases both HIC and reporter mRNA levels, whereas upstream open reading frames located in the 5′-UTR repress the translation of HIC or of the reporter protein. In addition, ectopically expressed HIC protein is degraded by the proteasome, with a half-life of approximately 1 h, suggesting that upon activation, HIC expression in cells may be transient. The strict regulation of HIC expression at the levels of mRNA stability, translation efficiency and protein stability suggests that expression of the HIC protein and its involvement in the various pathways is required only under specific cellular conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2020333405,"Sex is considered as an evolutionary paradox, since its evolutionary advantage does not necessarily overcome the two fold cost of sharing half of one's offspring's genome with another member of the population. Here we demonstrate that sexual reproduction can be evolutionary stable even when its Darwinian fitness is twice as low when compared to the fitness of asexual mutants. We also show that more than two sexes are always evolutionary unstable. Our approach generalizes the evolutionary game theory to analyze species whose members are able to sense the sexual state of their conspecifics and to switch sexes consequently. The widespread emergence and maintenance of sex follows therefore from its co-evolution with even more widespread environmental sensing abilities."
