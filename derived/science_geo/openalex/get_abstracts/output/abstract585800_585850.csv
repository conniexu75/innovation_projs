https://openalex.org/W2611504720,"Methylmercury (MeHg) is a ubiquitous environmental neurotoxicant, with human exposures predominantly resulting from fish consumption. Developmental exposure of zebrafish to MeHg is known to alter their neurobehavior. The current study investigated the direct exposure and transgenerational effects of MeHg, at tissue doses similar to those detected in exposed human populations, on sperm epimutations (i.e., differential DNA methylation regions [DMRs]) and neurobehavior (i.e., visual startle and spontaneous locomotion) in zebrafish, an established human health model. F0 generation embryos were exposed to MeHg (0, 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 nM) for 24 hours ex vivo. F0 generation control and MeHg-exposed lineages were reared to adults and bred to yield the F1 generation, which was subsequently bred to the F2 generation. Direct exposure (F0 generation) and transgenerational actions (F2 generation) were then evaluated. Hyperactivity and visual deficit were observed in the unexposed descendants (F2 generation) of the MeHg-exposed lineage compared to control. An increase in F2 generation sperm epimutations was observed relative to the F0 generation. Investigation of the DMRs in the F2 generation MeHg-exposed lineage sperm revealed associated genes in the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and actin-cytoskeleton pathways being effected, which correlate to the observed neurobehavioral phenotypes. Developmental MeHg-induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of abnormal neurobehavior is correlated with sperm epimutations in F2 generation adult zebrafish. Therefore, mercury can promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease in zebrafish, which significantly impacts its environmental health considerations in all species including humans."
https://openalex.org/W2610793718,"Palmitic acid (PA) and other saturated fatty acids are known to stimulate pro-inflammatory responses in human immune cells via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). However, the molecular mechanism responsible for fatty acid stimulation of TLR4 remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that PA functions as a ligand for TLR4 on human monocyte derived dendritic cells (MoDCs). Hydrophobicity protein modeling indicated PA can associate with the hydrophobic binding pocket of TLR4 adaptor protein MD-2. Isothermal titration calorimetry quantified heat absorption that occurred during PA titration into TLR4/MD2, indicating that PA binds to TLR4/MD2. Treatment of human MoDCs with PA resulted in endocytosis of TLR4, further supporting the function of PA as a TLR4 agonist. In addition, PA stimulated DC maturation and activation based on the upregulation of DC costimulatory factors CD86 and CD83. Further experiments showed that PA induced TLR4 dependent secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Lastly, our experimental data show that PA stimulation of NF-κB canonical pathway activation is regulated by TLR4 signaling and that reactive oxygen species may be important in upregulating this pro-inflammatory response. Our experiments demonstrate for the first time that PA activation of TLR4 occurs in response to direct molecular interactions between PA and MD-2. In summary, our findings suggest a likely molecular mechanism for PA induction of pro-inflammatory immune responses in human dendritic cells expressing TLR4."
https://openalex.org/W2611858761,"Manganese is an essential metal that becomes toxic at elevated levels. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC30A10, a cell-surface-localized manganese efflux transporter, cause a heritable manganese metabolism disorder resulting in elevated manganese levels and parkinsonian-like movement deficits. The underlying disease mechanisms are unclear; therefore, treatment is challenging. To understand the consequences of loss of SLC30A10 function at the organism level, we generated Slc30a10 knock-out mice. During early development, knock-outs were indistinguishable from controls. Surprisingly, however, after weaning and compared with controls, knock-out mice failed to gain weight, were smaller, and died prematurely (by ∼6–8 weeks of age). At 6 weeks, manganese levels in the brain, blood, and liver of the knock-outs were ∼20–60-fold higher than controls. Unexpectedly, histological analyses revealed that the brain and liver of the knock-outs were largely unaffected, but their thyroid exhibited extensive alterations. Because hypothyroidism leads to growth defects and premature death in mice, we assayed for changes in thyroid and pituitary hormones. At 6 weeks and compared with controls, the knock-outs had markedly reduced thyroxine levels (∼50–80%) and profoundly increased thyroid-stimulating hormone levels (∼800–1000-fold), indicating that Slc30a10 knock-out mice develop hypothyroidism. Importantly, a low-manganese diet produced lower tissue manganese levels in the knock-outs and rescued the phenotype, suggesting that manganese toxicity was the underlying cause. Our unanticipated discovery highlights the importance of determining the role of thyroid dysfunction in the onset and progression of manganese-induced disease and identifies Slc30a10 knock-out mice as a new model for studying thyroid biology.

Manganese is an essential metal that becomes toxic at elevated levels (1Aschner M. Erikson K.M. Herrero Hernández E. Tjalkens R. Manganese and its role in Parkinson's disease: from transport to neuropathology.Neuromolecular Med. 2009; 11: 252-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Historically, toxicity has been reported in occupational settings where workers are exposed to elevated manganese over prolonged periods (1Aschner M. Erikson K.M. Herrero Hernández E. Tjalkens R. Manganese and its role in Parkinson's disease: from transport to neuropathology.Neuromolecular Med. 2009; 11: 252-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that toxicity may also develop after elevated exposure from environmental sources (2Lucchini R.G. Guazzetti S. Zoni S. Benedetti C. Fedrighi C. Peli M. Donna F. Bontempi E.

Additionally, manganese is primarily excreted in bile; therefore, patients with hepatic dysfunction fail to excrete manganese and may subsequently suffer from toxicity (4Butterworth R.F. Parkinsonism in cirrhosis: pathogenesis and current therapeutic options.Metab. Brain Dis. 2013; 28: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The primary manifestation of overt manganese toxicity in occupationally exposed humans is the onset of a parkinsonian-like movement disorder (1Aschner M. Erikson K.M. Herrero Hernández E. Tjalkens R.

The above neurological sequelae are attributed to direct neurotoxicity; manganese accumulates in the brain, particularly in the basal ganglia, and induces neuronal injury (1Aschner M. Erikson K.M. Herrero Hernández E. Tjalkens R. Manganese and its role in Parkinson's disease: from transport to neuropathology.Neuromolecular Med. 2009; 11: 252-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). That manganese, at elevated levels, is neurotoxic is well established; however, whether manganese induces damage to other organs in a manner that may, in turn, impact neurological function is unknown.

We discovered that SLC30A10 functioned as a cell-surface-localized manganese efflux transporter that protected cells and Caenorhabditis elegans against manganese toxicity (21Leyva-Illades D. Chen P.

Disease-causing mutations blocked the intracellular trafficking and manganese efflux activity of the transporter; consequently, cells and worms that expressed these mutants exhibited heightened sensitivity to manganese toxicity (21Leyva-Illades D.

Our comparison of a structural prediction of SLC30A10 with the solved crystal structure of YiiP, a related bacterial zinc transporter (YiiP is the only cation diffusion facilitator that has a solved crystal structure (28Lu M. Chai J. Fu D. Structural basis for autoregulation of the zinc transporter YiiP.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1063-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 29Lu M. Fu D. Structure of the zinc transporter YiiP.Science. 2007; 317: 1746-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar)), revealed that there were fundamental differences between a crucial zinc-binding site in the transmembrane domain of YiiP and the corresponding putative metal binding site of SLC30A10 (22Zogzas C.E. Aschner M. Mukhopadhyay S. Structural elements in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the metal transporter SLC30A10 are required for its manganese efflux activity.J. Biol.

Molecular studies are important in determining the mode of action of SLC30A10. However, to understand the process by which loss of function of SLC30A10 induces disease, studies in Slc30a10 knock-out mice are essential. Availability of genetically modified Slc30a10 strains will make it possible to determine whether a causal relationship exists between loss of SLC30A10 function and development of manganese-induced disease. Further, as described earlier, there is substantial overlap in the neurological presentation of patients who suffer from manganese toxicity caused by SLC30A10 mutations and those that develop toxicity caused by elevated manganese exposure or hepatic dysfunction (4Butterworth R.F.

Because of this overlap, Slc30a10 knock-out animals may become a useful model to study the mechanisms of manganese neurotoxicity in general. Finally, availability of these mice may aid efforts to develop small molecules for the management of manganese toxicity. Here, we generated full-body, constitutive Slc30a10 knock-out mice and characterized their phenotype. We anticipated that the knock-out animals would develop motor defects. Instead, we made the surprising discovery that manganese toxicity induced severe hypothyroidism in these mice. Thus far, the relationship between thyroid function and manganese toxicity has received little attention, and whether human patients of manganese toxicity develop hypothyroidism is unknown. Importantly, however, thyroid hormone has profound effects on neuronal development and function (30Hall J.E. Thyroid metabolic hormones.in: Textbook of Medical Physiology. Elsevier, Philadelphia, PA2016: 951-963Google Scholar), and if hypothyroidism is a feature of manganese toxicity, it may exacerbate the direct neurotoxic effects of manganese. Thus, an important implication of our findings is that it is now important to determine whether hypothyroidism contributes to the pathobiology of manganese toxicity in humans. Separately, our work identifies Slc30a10 knock-out mice to be a novel model to study thyroid biology. The mouse Slc30a10 gene has four exons and encodes a protein of 470 amino acids. Exon 1 encodes the first 205 amino acids, which encompasses a significant portion of the predicted transmembrane domain (amino acid 1–299). Because the transmembrane domain is required for metal transport (22Zogzas C.E. Aschner M. Mukhopadhyay S. Structural elements in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the metal transporter SLC30A10 are required for its manganese efflux activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 15940-15957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), large deletions in this domain should inactivate the protein. In contrast, a partially active protein could be produced if downstream exons were deleted. Therefore, deletion of exon 1 provided the best approach to secure complete loss of function of Slc30a10; hence, we targeted exon 1. We produced animals in which exon 1 of Slc30a10 was flanked by loxP sites, as described under “Experimental procedures.” Heterozygous and homozygous floxed mice appeared phenotypically normal. That is, unlike Slc30a10 knock-out mice, the body size and manganese levels of homozygous and heterozygous floxed animals were comparable with those of mice that were wild-type for the Slc30a10 gene (see Figure 1, Figure 2 for phenotype of Slc30a10 knock-outs). Therefore, for this study, we considered homozygous and heterozygous floxed animals to be comparable with wild-types and designated these three genotypes as Slc30a10+/+. To delete exon 1, we bred floxed animals with transgenic Sox2Cre mice (see “Experimental procedures” for details about the Sox2Cre strain) and obtained animals in which exon 1 of one copy of Slc30a10 was deleted. These mice were designated as Slc30a10+/− and were heterozygous for the Slc30a10 knock-out. After another round of breeding, we obtained mice in which exon 1 of Slc30a10 was deleted in both chromosomes; these mice were the knock-out strain and designated Slc30a10−/−. Note that some Slc30a10+/− and Slc30a10−/− mice retained the Cre transgene; however, there was no effect of Cre expression on body size or manganese levels. Therefore, for these genotypes, we combined animals with or without Cre expression into one group. To routinely genotype animals, we performed PCR from genomic DNA. We ran two separate reactions designed to either amplify a product from the wild-type/floxed allele or from the knock-out allele (Fig. 1A). In Slc30a10+/+ animals, a positive product was detected for the wild-type/floxed allele but not the knock-out allele; in Slc30a10+/−, positive products were detected for both reactions; and in Slc30a10−/−, a positive PCR product was detected for the knock-out, but not the wild-type/floxed allele (Fig. 1A). For selected animals, we verified the PCR results by performing reverse transcription-PCR assays, which confirmed that Cre-mediated recombination led to a loss of Slc30a10 mRNA in Slc30a10−/− mice (Fig. 1B). Despite extensive efforts, we were unable to validate loss of Slc30a10 gene product at the protein level in knock-outs using immunoblots because we could not identify any commercial antibody that specifically detected SLC30A10 in rodent tissue. To get around this hurdle, we generated an antibody against the C-terminal domain of human SLC30A10. Unfortunately, we discovered that although this antibody specifically detected SLC30A10 in human cell lines, it lost specificity when mouse tissue samples were used. Despite the lack of immunoblot data, the results obtained from the genomic DNA PCR were unequivocal and confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR. Therefore, we used PCR as an accurate m"

The study also determined the effects of continuous potato cropping (without legumes) on the above mentioned soil properties and yield. The number of bacteria increased significantly (p < 0.05) under P–B rotation by 78%, 85% and 83% in the 2, 4 and 7–year continuous cropping soils, respectively compared to P–C rotation. The highest fungi/bacteria ratio was found in P–C (0.218), followed by P–L (0.184) and then P–B (0.137) rotation over the different cropping years. In the continuous potato cropping soils, the greatest fungi/bacteria ratio was recorded in the 4–year (0.4067) and 7–year (0.4238) cropping soils and these were significantly higher than 1–year (0.3041), 2–year (0.2545) and 3–year (0.3030) cropping soils. Generally, actinomycetes numbers followed the trend P–L>P–C>P–B. The P–L rotation increased aerobic azotobacters in 2–year (by 26% and 18%) and 4–year (40% and 21%) continuous cropping soils compared to P–C and P–B rotation, respectively. Generally, the highest urease and alkaline phosphate activity, respectively, were observed in P–C (55.77 mg g–1) and (27.71 mg g–1), followed by P–B (50.72 mg mg–1) and (25.64 mg g–1) and then P–L (41.61 mg g–1) and (23.26 mg g–1) rotation. Soil urease, alkaline phosphatase and hydrogen peroxidase activities decreased with increasing years of continuous potato cropping. On average, the P–B rotation significantly increased (p <0.05) tuber yield by 19% and 18%, compared to P–C and P–L rotation respectively. P–L rotation also increased potato tuber yield compared to P–C, but the effect was lesser relative to P–B rotation. These results suggest that adopting potato–legume rotation system has the potential to improve soil biology environment, alleviate continuous cropping obstacle and increase potato tuber yield in semi–arid region."

The Bacteroides are generalist glycan degraders, and this function is mediated largely by polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs). The genomes of several Bacteroides species contain a PUL, PUL1,6-β-glucan, that was predicted to target mixed linked plant 1,3;1,4-β-glucans. To test this hypothesis we characterized the proteins encoded by this locus in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a member of the human gut microbiota. We show here that PUL1,6-β-glucan does not orchestrate the degradation of a plant polysaccharide but targets a fungal cell wall glycan, 1,6-β-glucan, which is a growth substrate for the bacterium. The locus is up-regulated by 1,6-β-glucan and encodes two enzymes, a surface endo-1,6-β-glucanase, BT3312, and a periplasmic β-glucosidase that targets primarily 1,6-β-glucans. The non-catalytic proteins encoded by PUL1,6-β-glucan target 1,6-β-glucans and comprise a surface glycan-binding protein and a SusD homologue that delivers glycans to the outer membrane transporter.

PULs are typically expressed at low levels in the absence of target glycan. However, when a substrate glycan is encountered, the corresponding PUL is rapidly up-regulated, often up to 1000-fold, driven by recognition of a specific oligosaccharide or monosaccharide cue (1.Martens E.C.

Surface enzyme(s) and glycan-binding proteins (SGBPs) orchestrate degradation of polysaccharides into smaller oligosaccharides that can be imported by the SusCD-like complex, a TonB-dependent membrane transporter (5.Glenwright A.J.

In the periplasm, additional enzymes depolymerize the imported oligosaccharides into their component monosaccharides, which are transported into the cytoplasm and then metabolized. The enzymes that degrade these glycans are mainly glycoside hydrolases (GHs); uronic acid-containing polysaccharides are depolymerized with the assistance of polysaccharide lyases. GHs are grouped into sequence-based families on the CAZy database (www.cazy.org) (6.Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B.

Within these families the enzyme fold, catalytic apparatus, and mechanism are largely conserved.

Recently, in addition to plant- and host-derived glycans, carbohydrates produced by microbes have been shown to be a source of nutrients for Bacteroides sp., and in particular Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. B. thetaiotaomicron is able to degrade the extracellular polysaccharide of Lactobacillus spp., and the cell wall α-mannan from fungal species such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans (9.Lammerts van Bueren A.

The ability to use microbial sources of glycans as nutrients may confer nutritional resilience upon B. thetaiotaomicron and related organisms in the face of a variable supply of dietary carbohydrates. α-Mannan is an outer layer of the fungal cell wall in the species described above and covers skeletal layers of β-glucan and chitin. The heavily decorated mannoproteins of the cell wall are cross-linked through their glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor to chains of 1,6-β-glucans that are in turn linked to both the 1,3-β-glucan and chitin chains (11.Erwig L.P. Gow N.A. Interactions of fungal pathogens with phagocytes.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). When B. thetaiotaomicron is cultured on yeast extract, in addition to the up-regulation of loci that orchestrate α-mannan degradation, an additional PUL defined as PUL1,6-β-glucan is activated during early exponential phase (12.Sonnenburg E.D.

This locus encodes just two enzymes, which belong to GH families 3 (GH3) and 30 subfamily 3 (GH30_3). Although 1,6-β-glucanase is the only activity reported for enzymes within GH30_3, the majority of these GHs are fungal in origin and likely to be transglucosidases involved in cell-wall remodeling. Within the fungal mycoparasite Trichoderma harzanium, GH30_3 enzymes contribute to the ability of the organism to antagonize plant pathogenic fungi (13.Lora J.M. De la Cruz J. Llobell A. Benítez T. Pintor-Toro J.A. Molecular characterization and heterologous expression of an endo-β-1,6-glucanase gene from the mycoparasitic fungus Trichoderma harzianum.Mol. Gen.

One bacterial GH30_3 enzyme has been characterized, from the marine bacterium Saccharophagus degradans, which is active on 1,6-β-glucan as well as the branched algal polysaccharide laminarin (1,3;1,6-β-glucan) (15.Wang D. Kim D.H. Yun E.J. Park Y.C. Seo J.H. Kim K.H. The first bacterial β-1,6-endoglucanase from Saccharophagus degradans 2–40T for the hydrolysis of pustulan and laminarin.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2017; 101: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Given the role of 1,6-β-glucan in the cross-linking of mannoproteins into the fungal cell wall matrix, this glucan might comprise a target for bacteria that degrade α-mannan, because cleavage of the 1,6-β-glucosidic bonds would enable release of mannoproteins. Additionally, 1,6-β-glucan is found in edible fungi such as the basidiomycetes Agaricus bisporus (common mushroom) and Lentinula edodes (Shiitake mushroom), and thus these mushrooms comprise another source of the polysaccharide for B. thetaiotaomicron and, more widely, the human gut microbiota. Although 1,6-β-glucans are common components of the human diet through intake of yeast cell wall and edible fungi, little is known of how these glycans are utilized by the gut microbiota. More broadly, little is known about the enzymes that degrade 1,6-β-glucans, and there is no structural data for any GH30_3 enzyme. Here we have tested the hypothesis that PUL1,6-β-glucan in B. thetaiotaomicron plays a role in the degradation and utilization of yeast 1,6-β-glucans and not plant 1,3;1,4-β-mixed linked glucans as previously proposed (1.Martens E.C. Lowe E.C. Chiang H. Pudlo N.A. Wu M. McNulty N.P. Abbott D.W. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Bolam D.N. Gordon J.I. Recognition and degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides by two human gut symbionts.PLoS Biol. 2011; 9: e1001221Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Our data show that this locus orchestrates the degradation of 1,6-β-glucan, and this enables B. thetaiotaomicron to utilize this fungal polysaccharide. The surface-located endo-1,6-β-glucanase is shown to be critical for growth of the bacterium on 1,6-β-glucan. The crystal structure of the endo-1,6-β-glucanase shows that substrate recognition is mediated by shape complementarity of the substrate-binding cleft and the hooked U-shaped conformation of 1,6-β-glucan, rather than through extensive hydrogen-bonding interactions with the polysaccharide. When B. thetaiotaomicron was cultured on the complex tryptone-yeast extract-glucose (TYG) medium, a suite of PULs were up-regulated compared with glucose minimal medium, including the locus PUL1,6-β-glucan (10.Cuskin F.

PUL1,6-β-glucan was predicted to extend from bt3309 to bt3314 (Fig. 1A) and is predicted to encode five proteins: a SusR type regulator (BT3309), a SusCD-like pair (BT3310–11), and enzymes belonging to GH30_3 (BT3312) and GH3 (BT3314). BT3311, BT3312, and BT3313 each possess a type II signal peptide with a canonical lipoprotein box and are thus likely located on the surface of the bacterium. Because BT3313 contains multiple DUF5016 domains (also referred to as immunoglobulin domains), it is predicted to function as a SGBP (Fig. 1A) (12.Sonnenburg E.D. Zheng H. Joglekar P. Higginbottom S.K. Firbank S.J. Bolam D.N. Sonnenburg J.L. Specificity of polysaccharide use in intestinal Bacteroides species determines diet-induced microbiota alterations.Cell. 2010; 141: 1241-1252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The yeast-derived glycans in TYG medium include 1,6-β-glucan (also known as pustulan), 1,3-β-glucan, α-mannan, and chitin. B. thetaiotaomicron is unable to grow on laminarin, whereas the α-mannan-degrading apparatus is encoded by three PULs that are distinct from PUL1,6-β-glucan (10.Cuskin F. Lowe E.C. Temple M.J. Zhu Y. Cameron E.A. Pudlo N.A. Porter N.T. Urs K. Thompson A.J. Cartmell A. Rogowski A. Hamilton B.S. Chen R. Tolbert T.J. Piens K. et al.Human gut Bacteroidetes can utilize yeast mannan through a selfish mechanism.Nature. 2015; 517: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), suggesting that the locus may target pustulan. To test this hypothesis B. thetaiotaomicron was cultured on pustulan, and transcription of the five genes in this locus were evaluated by RT-PCR. The gene encoding the PUL regulator BT3309 was not activated by pustulan; bt3314 was up-regulated 10-fold; and transcription of the other genes in the locus increased ∼100-fold. The PUL was not activated when B. thetaiotaomicron was cultured on α-mannan. These data indicate that PUL1,6-β-glucan encodes the pustulan degrading apparatus of B. thetaiotaomicron. This assumption was confirmed when the bacterium was shown to be unable to grow on pustulan when the gene encoding the predicted surface GH30_3 enzyme (bt3312) was deleted from the chromosome (Fig. 1E). GH family 30 contains enzymes that are active on a variety of β-linked glycans, including xylan, glucuronoxylan, glucosylceramide, and 1,6-β-glucan. The fungal cell wall contains 1,6-β-glucan, consistent with the location of BT3312 within GH30_3, a subfamily which, to date, is comprised exclusively of 1,6-β-glucanases. When cultured on 1,6-β-glucan, B. thetaiotaomicron released glucooligosaccharides into the supernatant during exponential growth, which correlates with the predicted endo-1,6-β-glucanase activity of the surface enzyme BT3312 (Fig. 1, D and E). The catalytic activity of BT3312 was tested against a range of polysaccharides. The enzyme showed no activity on 1,3-β-glucan, 1,4-β-glucan, or 1,6-β-galactan but was active on the 1,6-β-glucan pustulan, producing a range of oligosaccharides in the initial phases of the degradative process (Fig. 2). Thus, BT3312 is a canonical and highly specific endo-1,6-β-glucanase. The limit products generated by BT3312 were primarily glucose and gentiobiose (1,6-β-glucobiose), suggesting the enzyme is active on oligosaccharides as small as glucotriose (Fig. 2). Substrate depletion assays with 1,6-β-glucooligosaccharides showed activity on oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization ranging from 3 to 8 (Table 1). The moderate 4-fold increase in activity from glucotriose to glucooctaose suggests that the enzyme contains only three major subsites. This view is consistent with the observation that 1,6-β-glucotetraose was initially hydrolyzed to glucotriose, gentiobiose, and glucose in a molar ratio of 1:2:1 (data not shown), which showed that the substrate could bind productively in the two possible binding modes that encompass −2, −1, and +1 (i.e. −3 to +1 and −2 to +2; the scissile glycosidic bond links the sugars at −1 and +1) (16.Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Nomenclature for sugar-binding subsites in glycosyl hydrolases.Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Thus, −3 and +2 are not essential for substrate binding, indicating that the only functionally significant subsites in the enzyme substrate-binding cleft extend from −2 to +1. The inability of BT3312 to hydrolyze gentiobiose, which would require binding at the −1 and +1 subsites for cleavage to occur, reveals the important contribution the −2 subsite makes to productive substrate recognition, typical of endo-acting retaining glycanases (17.Charnock S.J.

Open table in a new tab Based on the presence of a lipoprotein box within its signal peptide, BT3312 is predicted to be located on the outer membrane. Indeed, the ability of Δbt3312 to grow on a mixture of 1,6-β-glucooligosaccharides but not pustulan strongly indicates that BT3312 is required to depolymerize the glycan at the bacterial surface, generating molecules of an appropriate size for import through the outer membrane. To provide further support for this hypothesis, whole cell polysaccharide depolymerization assays were performed under aerobic conditions, which prevents transport of oligosaccharides through the outer membrane, and thus report exclusively on the activity of surface enzymes (10.Cuskin F. Lowe E.C. Temple M.J. Zhu Y. Cameron E.A. Pudlo N.A. Porter N.T. Urs K. Thompson A.J. Cartmell A. Rogowski A. Hamilton B.S. Chen R. Tolbert T.J.

Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3192-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). When wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron, grown on pustulan or 1,6-β-glucooligosaccharides to activate PUL1,6-β-glucan, was subjected to aerobic whole-cell polysaccharide depolymerization assays with pustulan, the bacterium generated a range of glucooligosaccharides, consistent with the activity observed for purified BT3312 (Fig. 1F). Equivalent whole-cell assays of the Δbt3312 mutant grown on 1,6-β-glucooligosaccharides, which also activate PUL1,6-β-glucan, did not produce pustulan-derived oligosaccharides (Fig. 1F). Collectively, these data show that BT3312 is located on the surface of B. thetaiotaomicron. No structure of a GH30_3 enzyme has been reported. Thus, to explore the mechanism of catalysis and substrate binding of an endo-1,6-β-glucanase, the crystal structure of BT3312 was determined in complex with the ligand β-glucosyl-1,6-deoxynojirimycin (GlcDNJ). The structures of the apo- and ligand-bound enzyme were solved by molecular replacement to a resolution of 1.9 and 1.85 Å, respectively, using a GH30 subfamily glucosylceramidase enzyme (PDB code 3RIL) as the search model (Fig. 3 and Table 2). In the ligand complex, unambiguous electron density corresponding to GlcDNJ was evident. The crystal structure revealed that BT3312 comprises two domains. The catalytic domain adopts a (β/α)8 barrel fold (TIM barrel), extending from residues Asp82 to Lys427, and a β-sandwich domain comprising sequences from both the N and C termini (Fig. 3A). The TIM barrel contains a central eight-stranded β-barrel, and extending from each β-strand is an α-helix. Extended loops link the α-helices with the β-barrel, and a small β-sheet comprising three anti-parallel strands is inserted into the loop connecting β-strand-8 and α-helix-8. The β-sandwich domain contains seven antiparallel β-strands in one sheet, with two contributed by the N-terminal region of the enzyme. The other β-sheet comprises three antiparallel strands with one derived from the N terminus. Because BT3312 is classified into GH30, it is a member of clan GH-A in which the fold, catalytic apparatus, and mechanism are conserved (19.Henrissat B. Callebaut I. Fabrega S. Lehn P. Mornon J.P. Davies G. Conserved catalytic machinery and the prediction of a common fold for several families of glycosyl hydrolases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). According to these criteria BT3312 is predicted to use a double-displacement mechanism in which anomeric configuration is retained after bond cleavage. In this two-step mechanism, an enzymic nucleophile performs a nucleophilic attack and generates a glycosyl enzyme intermediate, which in the second step is hydrolyzed. An enzymic residue assists departure of the anomeric group in the first step, acting as a general acid, and assists the hydrolysis of the glycosyl enzyme intermediate in the second step, acting as a general base. The catalytic acid/base and nucleophile have been assigned for a GH30 family member, human β-glucocerebrosidase, and are located at the end of β-strands 4 and 7 of the barrel, respectively (20.Miao S. McCarter J.D. Grace M.E. Grabowski G.A. Aebersold R. Withers S.G.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10975-10978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the candidate catalytic residues are Glu238 (acid/base) and Glu339 (nucleophile). Consistent with this prediction, mutation of either of these residues to Ala resulted in the complete loss of activity (Table 1).Table 2Data collection and refinement statisticsBT3312 no ligandBT3312 ligandData collectionDate26/01/1404/07/15SourceI02I03Wavelength (Å)0.97940.7749Space groupP21P21Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)62.4, 156.0, 78.062.4, 78.8, 145.5α, β, γ (°)90.0, 95.0, 90.090.0, 100.4, 90.0No. of measured reflections429,705 (10,374)445,926 (22,895)No. of independent reflections114,209 (4871)116,665 (5762)Resolution (Å)48.24–1.90 (1.93–1.90)48.79–1.85 (1.88–1.85)CC1/20.996 (0.466)0.996 (0.644)I/σI9.0 (1.8)7.8 (1.6)Completeness (%)97.4 (97.6)99.2 (86.2)Redundancy3.8 (4.0)3.8 (2.1)RefinementRwork/Rfree18.19/22.1218.84/22.80No. atomsProtein10,81310,738Ligand/ions068Water607606B-factorsProtein34.330.6Ligand/IonsN.A.29.5Water37.532.5Root mean square deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.0130.013Bond angles (°)1.531.52PDB code5NGK5NGL Open table in a new tab Based on analysis of other clan GH-A members, the substrate-binding site of BT3312 is predicted to be positioned on top of the β-barrel. Inspection of this region of the enzyme reveals a deep U-shaped cleft that houses the catalytic residues. The active site cleft of BT3312 adopts a different topology to the substrate-binding regions of other GH-A endo-acting enzymes, which typically display linear or curved clefts that are open at both ends (Figs. 3D and 4A). Interestingly, NMR analysis of Candida glabrata 1,6-β-glucan revealed a hooked, U-shaped conformation (21.Lowman D.W. West L.J. Bearden D.W. Wempe M.F. Power T.D. Ensley H.E. Haynes K. Williams D.L. Kruppa M.D. New insights into the structure of (1→3,1→6)-β-d-glucan side chains in the Candida glabrata cell wall.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e27614Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which is complementary to the topology of the substrate-binding region of BT3312 (see below). The structure of BT3312 bound to GlcDNJ reveals details of the active site and the distal substrate-binding subsites (Fig. 3, B and C). The Glc at the −2 subsite adopts a relaxed chair (4C1) conformation, whereas DNJ bound in the −1 subsite, the active site, is distorted and adopts a 4E envelope conformation. Substrate distortion at the active site is a characteristic feature of GHs, because distorted conformations require less nuclear movements to achieve the transition state structure and allow the geometric and stereoelectronic requirements of the reaction to be achieved. In particular, GHs undergo reactions involving “exploded” transition states with significant oxocarbonium-ion like character, in which the endocyclic oxygen and anomeric carbon are required to be in the same plane to share the developing positive charge (22.Davies G. Henrissat B. Structures and mechanisms of glycosyl hydrolases.Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). Because most β-gluco-active enzymes proceed through a transition state in a 4H3 (half-chair) conformation and because the 4E and 4H3 conformations are adjacent to each other on a “Stoddard” conformational plot of pyranose ring conformations, this result is suggestive that this enzyme utilizes a 1S3–4H3‡–4C1 conformational itinerary along the reaction coordinate (23.Speciale G.

Res. 2012; 45: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Despite the resemblance of GlcDNJ to the proposed transition state, the inhibitor bound extremely weakly to the enzyme, with an estimated KI of ∼1 mm, suggesting that additional sugar residues may be required to fully capitalize on interactions along the active site cleft. Indeed, mutagenesis data described below suggest the enzyme has at least four functional subsites for the polysaccharide pustulan. The polar interactions between the active site of BT3312 and GlcDNJ are displayed in Fig. 3 (B and C). Within the −1 subsite, the carboxylate of Glu339 and Nδ2 of Asn237 make polar contacts with O2. O3 interacts with Nϵ1 of Trp179, Nδ2 of Asn244, and the carboxylate of Asp131. The Oδ2 of Asp131 and Nϵ1 of Trp377 make hydrogen bonds with O4. Finally, the endocyclic nitrogen donates a hydrogen bond to Oδ2 of Glu339. Binding of GlcDNJ in the active site is also mediated through"

However, the mechanisms underlying this effect are unclear, and no previous work has examined the impact of social support on basic fear learning processes, which have implications for threat responding. This study examined whether social support inhibits the formation of fear associations. After conducting a fear-conditioning procedure in which social-support stimuli were paired with conditional stimuli during fear acquisition, we found that the threat of shock was not associated with conditional stimuli paired with images of social-support figures, but was associated with stimuli paired with images of strangers. These findings indicate that social support prevents the formation of fear associations, reducing the amount of learned fears people acquire as they navigate the world, consequently reducing threat-related stress."
https://openalex.org/W2610792835,"Background Immune activation plays a key role in HIV pathogenesis. Markers of inflammation have been associated with vitamin D deficiency in the general population. Studies have also demonstrated associations of vitamin D deficiency with increased risk of HIV progression and death. The relationship between persistent inflammation and immune activation during chronic HIV infection and vitamin D deficiency remains unclear. Methods Cryopreserved specimens were analyzed from 663 participants at the time of enrollment from the Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV/AIDS in the Era of Effective Therapy (SUN Study) from 2004 to 2006. Biomarkers of inflammation, atherosclerosis, and coagulation were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and electrochemiluminescence. 25(OH)D, the stable precursor form of vitamin D, was measured using a radioimmunoassay with levels defined as: normal (≥30ng/mL), insufficient (20–29 ng/mL) and deficient (<20 ng/mL). Monocyte phenotypes were assessed by flow cytometry. Linear and logistic regression models were used to determine statistical associations between biomarkers and vitamin D deficiency. Results 25(OH)D levels were deficient in 251 (38%) participants, insufficient in 222 (34%), and normal in 190 (29%). Patients with vitamin D deficiency, when compared to those with insufficient or normal vitamin D levels, had increased levels of IL-6 (23%; p<0.01), TNF-α (21%, p = 0.03), D-dimer (24%, p = 0.01), higher proportions of CD14dimCD16+ (22%, p<0.01) and CX3CR1+ monocytes (48%; p<0.001) and decreased frequency of CCR2+ monocytes (-3.4%, p<0.001). In fully adjusted models, vitamin D associations with abnormal biomarker levels persisted for IL-6 levels and CX3CR1+ and CCR2+ phenotypes. Conclusions Vitamin D deficiency is associated with greater inflammation and activated monocyte phenotypes. The role of vitamin D deficiency in persistent immune activation and associated complications during chronic HIV disease should be further evaluated as a possible target for intervention."

To understand the post-transcriptional mechanisms underlying such placental gene expression changes, our objective was to identify key non-coding microRNAs that express biological function. To this end, we initially undertook microarrays targeting microRNAs in a small sub-set of placentas of appropriate (AGA) versus small for gestational age (SGA) weight infants, and observed up-regulation of 97 miRs and down-regulation of 44 miRs in SGA versus AGA. In a larger cohort of samples (AGA, n = 21; SGA, n = 11; IUGR subset, n = 5), we validated by qRT-PCR differential expression of three specific microRNAs (miR-10b, -363 and -149) that target genes mediating angiogenesis and nutrient transfer. Validation yielded an increase in miR-10b and -363 expression of ~2.5-fold (p<0.02 each) in SGA versus AGA, and of ~3-fold (p<0.005) in IUGR versus AGA, with no significant change despite a trending increase in miR-149. To further establish a cause-and-effect paradigm, employing human HTR8 trophoblast cells, we assessed the effect of nutrient deprivation on miR expression and inhibition of endogenous miRs on target gene expression. In-vitro nutrient deprivation (~50%) increased the expression of miR-10b and miR-149 by 1.5-fold (p<0.02) while decreasing miR-363 (p<0.0001). Inhibition of endogenous miRs employing antisense sequences against miR-10b, -363 and -149 revealed an increase respectively in the expression of the target genes KLF-4 (transcription factor which regulates angiogenesis), SNAT1 and 2 (sodium coupled neutral amino acid transporters) and LAT2 (leucine amino acid transporter), which translated into a similar change in the corresponding proteins. Finally to establish functional significance we performed dual-luciferase reporter assays with 3’-insertion of miR-10b alone and observed a ~10% reduction in the 5’-luciferase activity versus the control. Lastly, we further validated by microarray and employing MirWalk software that the pathways and target genes identified by differentially expressed miRs in SGA/IUGR compared to AGA are consistent in a larger cohort. We have established the biological significance of various miRs that target common transcripts mediating pathways of importance, which are perturbed in the human IUGR placenta."
https://openalex.org/W2611815530,"Altered metabolism is an emerging hallmark of cancer, as malignant cells display a mammoth up-regulation of enzymes responsible for steering their bioenergetic and biosynthetic machinery. Thus, the recent anticancer therapeutic strategies focus on the targeting of metabolic enzymes, which has led to the identification of specific metabolic inhibitors. One of such inhibitors is 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP), with broad spectrum of anticancer activity due to its ability to inhibit multiple metabolic enzymes. However, the molecular characterization of its binding to the wide spectrum of target enzymes remains largely elusive. Therefore, in the present study we undertook in silico investigations to decipher the molecular nature of the docking of 3-BP with key target enzymes of glycolysis and TCA cycle by PatchDock and YASARA docking tools. Additionally, derivatives of 3-BP, dibromopyruvate (DBPA) and propionic acid (PA), with reported biological activity, were also investigated for docking to important target metabolic enzymes of 3-BP, in order to predict their therapeutic efficacy versus that of 3-BP. A comparison of the docking scores with respect to 3-BP indicated that both of these derivatives display a better binding strength to metabolic enzymes. Further, analysis of the drug likeness of 3-BP, DBPA and PA by Lipinski filter, admetSAR and FAF Drug3 indicated that all of these agents showed desirable drug-like criteria. The outcome of this investigation sheds light on the molecular characteristics of the binding of 3-BP and its derivatives with metabolic enzymes and thus may significantly contribute in designing and optimizing therapeutic strategies against cancer by using these agents."

In the last years, a growing interest to study the relationship between MS and psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, has emerged obtaining conflicting results. Diet-induced MS rat models have only examined the effects of high-fat or mixed cafeteria diets to a limited extent. We explored whether an anxiety-like behavior was associated with MS in non-stressed rats chronically submitted to a high-sucrose diet (20% sucrose in drinking water) using three different anxiety paradigms: the shock-probe/burying test (SPBT), the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and the open-field test (OFT). Behaviorally, the high-sucrose diet group showed an increase in burying behavior in the SPBT. Also, these animals displayed both avoidance to explore the central part of the arena and a significant increase in freezing behavior in the OFT and lack of effects in the EPM. Also, high-sucrose diet group showed signs of an MS-like condition: significant increases in body weight and body mass index, abdominal obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia. Plasma leptin and resistin levels were also increased. No changes in plasma corticosterone levels were found. These results indicate that rats under a 24-weeks high-sucrose diet develop an MS associated with an anxiety-like behavior. Although the mechanisms underlying this behavioral outcome remain to be investigated, the role of leptin is emphasized."

The expression of NRLP3 is abnormally elevated in numerous human inflammatory diseases, including pulmonary diseases. An injection of carrageenan (CAR) into the pleural cavity triggered an acute inflammatory response, leading to tissue damage, inflammatory exudates, leukocyte infiltration, and increased myeloperoxidase activity. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the inflammasome blocking agents BAY 11-7082 (30 mg/kg, i.p.) and Brilliant Blue G (BBG) (45.5 mg/kg, i.p.) in a mouse model of CAR-induced pleurisy. Treatment with BAY 11-7082 or BBG 1 h after CAR injection attenuated pulmonary membrane thickening and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration, reduced NF-κB translocation in the nucleus, and inhibited the assembly of the NRLP3/ASC/caspase-1 complex. Treatment with BAY 11-7082 or BBG also down-regulated iNOS, nitrotyrosine, and poly-ADP-ribosyl polymerase expression and inhibited CAR-induced apoptosis.

Furthermore, statistical analysis was performed on microbiological data as well as patient information and the results of the gastroenterological examination. We found that the variability concerning the production of virulence factors between strains was minimal, with 96.4% of isolates being CagA-positive and 92.8% producing detectable VacA levels. In addition, high frequency of bacterial resistance was observed for metronidazole (99.1%), followed by amoxicillin (33.3%), clarithromycin (14.4%) and tetracycline (4.5%). In conclusion, this study indicated that the infection rate of H. pylori infection within the cohort in the present study was surprisingly low (36.6%).

In addition to novel predicting methods, we also introduce tools for model interpretation and evaluation such as feature importance and partial dependence plots, or cross-validation. Our results show that Random Forest proved to be the best model with an R2 of around 0.54, followed by Gradient Boost Regressor with 0.5. Both the spatial lag model and the OLS fall behind with significantly lower performances of 0.43 and 0.3, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2611107549,"The Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway is involved in numerous cellular processes and it is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer disease. Recent studies identified a crucial role for this pathway in activity-dependent long-term depression (LTD) at hippocampal Schaffer collateral (SC)-CA1 synapses. However, it is unclear whether JAK-STAT signaling also regulates excitatory synaptic function at the anatomically distinct temporoammonic (TA) input to CA1 neurons. Here we demonstrate that LTD at adult TA-CA1 synapses involves JAK-STAT signaling, but unlike SC-CA1 synapses, requires rapid gene transcription. TA-CA1 LTD requires NMDA receptor activation and is independent of PI3K or ERK signaling. JAK-STAT signaling was critical for TA-CA1 LTD as inhibition of JAK or STAT blocked LTD induction and prevented NMDA-induced AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor internalization in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, an increase in phosphorylated JAK2 and STAT3 accompanied chemical induction of LTD and AMPA receptor internalization. STAT3-driven gene transcription was required for LTD as inhibition of STAT3-DNA binding, nuclear export, and gene transcription all prevented LTD induction. These data indicate an essential role for canonical JAK-STAT signaling in activity-dependent LTD at TA-CA1 synapses and provide valuable insight into the role of the TA input in hippocampal synaptic plasticity.-McGregor, G., Irving, A. J., Harvey, J. Canonical JAK-STAT signaling is pivotal for long-term depression at adult hippocampal temporoammonic-CA1 synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2610829676,"The Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses (NCLs), also known as Batten disease, result from mutations in over a dozen genes. Although, adults are susceptible, the NCLs are frequently classified as pediatric neurodegenerative diseases due to their greater pediatric prevalence. Initial clinical presentation usually consists of either seizures or retinopathy but develops to encompass both in conjunction with declining motor and cognitive function. The NCLs result in premature death due to the absence of curative therapies. Nevertheless, preclinical and clinical trials exist for various therapies. However, the genotypes of NCL animal models determine which therapeutic approaches can be assessed. Mutations of the CLN2 gene encoding a soluble lysosomal enzyme, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1), cause late infantile NCL/CLN2 disease. The genotype of the original mouse model of CLN2 disease, Cln2-/-, excludes mutation guided therapies like antisense oligonucleotides and nonsense suppression. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a model of CLN2 disease that allows for the assessment of all therapeutic approaches. Nonsense mutations in CLN2 disease are frequent, the most common being CLN2R208X. Thus, we created a mouse model that carries a mutation equivalent to the human p.R208X mutation. Molecular assessment of Cln2R207X/R207X tissues determined significant reduction in Cln2 transcript abundance and TPP1 enzyme activity. This reduction leads to the development of neurological impairment (e.g. tremors) and neuropathology (e.g. astrocytosis). Collectively, these assessments indicate that the Cln2R207X/R207X mouse is a valid CLN2 disease model which can be used for the preclinical evaluation of all therapeutic approaches including mutation guided therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2611669941,"HER2-positive breast cancer (HER2+ BC) is an aggressive subtype with a poor prognosis. Although the antibody trastuzumab, which targets the HER2 growth factor receptor, has improved survival rates, patients often present with de novo resistance or acquire resistance after an initial response. Identifying new ways to target HER2 signaling will be critical for overcoming trastuzumab resistance. FAM83A is a novel oncogene identified by its ability to confer resistance to EGFR therapies, a receptor closely related to HER2. Moreover, a prior study identified hyper-tyrosine phosphorylated FAM83A in trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ BC. Here, we find that FAM83A expression is elevated in 36% of HER2+ BC tumors. In a panel of HER2+ BC cell lines, FAM83A expression is significantly increased in the trastuzumab-resistant derivatives relative to parental controls. shRNA-mediated ablation of FAM83A in the panel of HER2+ BC cell lines suppresses HER2+ BC cell growth in both 2D and 3D cell cultures, elevates apoptosis markers, and suppresses PI3K signaling. Growth inhibition following FAM83A knock-down, however, was independent of trastuzumab sensitivity, suggesting that FAM83A is a key signaling component in HER2+ BCs that could serve as a novel therapeutic target in both trastuzumab-resistant and trastuzumab-sensitive cancers."

It is not known if this effect is α-Klotho independent or mediated by humoral or endogenous endothelial α-Klotho. In the present study, we aimed to characterize EC α-Klotho expression within the human vascular tree and to investigate the potential role of α-Klotho in determining FGF-23 mediated EC regulation. Human tissue and ECs from various organs were used for immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Primary cultures of human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) and human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) were used to generate in vitro cell models. We found endogenous α-Klotho expression in ECs from various organs except in microvascular ECs from human brain. Furthermore, FGF-23 stimulated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, nitric oxide (NO) production, and cell proliferation in HAECs. Interestingly, these effects were not observed in our HBMEC model in vitro. High phosphate treatment and endothelial α-Klotho knockdown mitigated FGF-23 mediated eNOS induction, NO production, and cell proliferation in HAECs. Rescue treatment with soluble α-Klotho did not reverse endothelial FGF-23 resistance caused by reduced or absent α-Klotho expression in HAECs. These novel observations provide evidence for differential α-Klotho functional expression in the human endothelium and its presence may play a role in determining the response to FGF-23 in the vascular tree. α-Klotho was not detected in cerebral microvascular ECs and its absence may render these cells nonresponsive to FGF-23."

We describe early and late responders and nonresponders, and estimate nonresponse bias in a nationwide questionnaire survey of survivors.In the Swiss Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, we compared characteristics of early responders (who answered an initial questionnaire), late responders (who answered after ≥1 reminder) and nonresponders. Sociodemographic and cancer-related information was available for the whole population from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. We compared observed prevalence of typical outcomes in responders to the expected prevalence in a complete (100% response) representative population we constructed in order to estimate the effect of nonresponse bias. We constructed the complete population using inverse probability of participation weights.Of 2328 survivors, 930 returned the initial questionnaire (40%); 671 returned the questionnaire after ≥1reminder (29%). Compared to early and late responders, we found that the 727 nonresponders (31%) were more likely male, aged <20 years, French or Italian speaking, of foreign nationality, diagnosed with lymphoma or a CNS or germ cell tumor, and treated only with surgery. But observed prevalence of typical estimates (somatic health, medical care, mental health, health behaviors) was similar among the sample of early responders (40%), all responders (69%), and the complete representative population (100%). In this survey, nonresponse bias did not seem to influence observed prevalence estimates.Nonresponse bias may play only a minor role in childhood cancer survivor studies, suggesting that results can be generalized to the whole population of such cancer survivors and applied in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2610444198,"Introduction Pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a rare cancer that occurs primarily in younger patients. The prognostic factors of pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma are largely undetermined, especially in elderly patients. The aim of this study was to examine the clinical characteristics and prognostic factors influencing survival after surgical resection in patients with pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma and also analyze the clinical manifestations and prognostic factors in elderly patients. Materials and methods The pathological records of 41 pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma patients (mean age, 61.4 years) who underwent surgical resection at our hospital between January 1991 and July 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Subjects >65 years of age (n = 22) were considered elderly. Results The median follow-up duration was 42.9 (interquartile range, 15.0–120.8) months. Sixteen patients (39.0%) experienced tumor relapse, including 13 patients (81.3%) within 2 years. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 57.9%. Tumor grade did not influence disease-free survival (P = 0.286). In the multivariate analysis, age, tumor size, pathological T3–4 status, and pathological N2 status were independent predictors of disease-free survival. The 5-year overall survival rate was 57.0%. Tumor grade also did not influence overall survival (P = 0.170). Age, tumor size, pathological T status, and pathological N2 status were independent predictors of overall survival. In elderly patients, the 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates were 41.4% and 41.5%, respectively. Pathological T status was the only independent predictor of both disease-free survival and overall survival in elderly patients. Conclusions Prognostic factors identified for pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma in this study differ from those of previous studies. Principally, tumor grade did not influence either disease-free survival or overall survival. Age, tumor size, and pathological factors were independent predictors of disease-free survival and overall survival. In elderly patients, pathological T status was the only independent predictor of disease-free survival and overall survival."

The lack of BCs and positional information in other cells is therefore the main obstacle to therapeutic approaches for limb regeneration. Hence, this study aimed to create blastema-like cells (BlCs) by overexpressing Msx1 and Msx2 genes in mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (mBMSCs) to regenerate a proximally amputated digit tip. We transduced mBMSCs with Msx1 and Msx2 genes and compared osteogenic activity and expression levels of several Msx-regulated genes (Bmp4, Fgf8, and keratin 14 (K14)) in BlC groups, including MSX1, MSX2, and MSX1/2 (in a 1:1 ratio) with those in mBMSCs and BCs in vitro and in vivo following injection into the amputation site. We found that Msx gene overexpression increased expression of specific blastemal markers and enhanced the proliferation rate and osteogenesis of BlCs compared with mBMSCs and BCs via activation of Fgf8 and Bmp4. Histological analyses indicated full regrowth of digit tips in the Msx-overexpressing groups, particularly in MSX1/2, through endochondral ossification 6 weeks post-injection. In contrast, mBMSCs and BCs formed abnormal bone and nail. Full digit tip was regenerated only in the MSX1/2 group and was related to boosted Bmp4, Fgf8, and K14 gene expression and to limb-patterning properties resulting from Msx1 and Msx2 overexpression.

We examined the production of IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies to PcPs 4, 6B, 9V and 14 by enumerating antibody secreting cells (ASCs) at day (D) 7 and determining fold-increase in serum antibody levels at D28 after vaccination with unconjugated PcPs in HIV seronegative subjects (n = 20) and in HIV patients who were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) (n = 28) or who were ART-naive (n = 11) and determined their association with ICOS+ and ICOS- circulating memory TFH (cmTFH) cells (CD4+CD45RA-CD27+CXCR5+PD-1+) and short lived plasmablasts (SPBs) at D7, and with PcP-specific and total IgM+ and IgG+ memory B cells at D0. In HIV seronegative subjects, production of IgG1+ and IgG2+ ASCs was consistently associated with the frequency of ICOS+ cmTFH cells but not ICOS- cmTFH cells or memory B cells. In contrast, post-vaccination ASCs in HIV patients, regardless of ART status, were lower than in HIV seronegative subjects and not associated with ICOS+ cmTFH cells, the expansion of which was absent (ART-naive patients) or much lower than in HIV seronegative subjects (ART-treated patients). Production of SPBs was also lower in ART-naive patients. Fold-increase in IgG2 antibodies at D28 also correlated with ICOS+ cmTFH cells at D7 in HIV seronegative subjects but not in HIV patients. These novel findings provide evidence that ICOS+ cmTFH cells contribute to the regulation of PcP-specific IgG antibody responses, including isotype diversification, and that TFH cell dysfunction may be a cause of impaired PcP-specific IgG antibody responses and increased susceptibility to pneumococcal disease in HIV patients."
https://openalex.org/W2610974271,"One of the main obstacles in the widespread application of gene therapeutic approaches is the necessity for efficient and safe transfection methods. For the introduction of small oligonucleotide gene therapeutics into a target cell, nanoparticle-based methods have been shown to be highly effective and safe. While immune cells are a most interesting target for gene therapy, transfection might influence basic immune functions such as cytokine expression and proliferation, and thus positively or negatively affect therapeutic intervention. Therefore, we investigated the effects of nanoparticle-mediated transfection such as polyethylenimine (PEI) or magnetic beads on immune cell proliferation.Human adherent and non-adherent PBMCs were transfected by various methods (e.g. PEI, Lipofectamine® 2000, magnetofection) and stimulated. Proliferation was measured by lymphocyte transformation test (LTT). Cell cycle stages as well as expression of proliferation relevant genes were analyzed. Additionally, the impact of nanoparticles was investigated in vivo in a murine model of the severe systemic immune disease GvHD (graft versus host disease).The proliferation of primary immune cells was influenced by nanoparticle-mediated transfection. In particular in the case of magnetic beads, proliferation inhibition coincided with short-term cell cycle arrest and reduced expression of genes relevant for immune cell proliferation. Notably, proliferation inhibition translated into beneficial effects in a murine GvHD model with animals treated with PEI-nanoparticles showing increased survival (pPEI = 0.002) most likely due to reduced inflammation.This study shows for the first time that nanoparticles utilized for gene therapeutic transfection are able to alter proliferation of immune cells and that this effect depends on the type of nanoparticle. For magnetic beads, this was accompanied by temporary cell cycle arrest. Notably, in GvHD this nonspecific anti-proliferative effect might contribute to reduced inflammation and increased survival."
https://openalex.org/W2610758484,"Collaborative beamforming (CBF) with a finite number of collaborating nodes (CNs) produces sidelobes that are highly dependent on the collaborating nodes' locations. The sidelobes cause interference and affect the communication rate of unintended receivers located within the transmission range. Nulling is not possible in an open-loop CBF since the collaborating nodes are unable to receive feedback from the receivers. Hence, the overall sidelobe reduction is required to avoid interference in the directions of the unintended receivers. However, the impact of sidelobe reduction on the capacity improvement at the unintended receiver has never been reported in previous works. In this paper, the effect of peak sidelobe (PSL) reduction in CBF on the capacity of an unintended receiver is analyzed. Three meta-heuristic optimization methods are applied to perform PSL minimization, namely genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm algorithm (PSO) and a simplified version of the PSO called the weightless swarm algorithm (WSA). An average reduction of 20 dB in PSL alongside 162% capacity improvement is achieved in the worst case scenario with the WSA optimization. It is discovered that the PSL minimization in the CBF provides capacity improvement at an unintended receiver only if the CBF cluster is small and dense."

To date there are no mesotrypsin-selective pharmacological inhibitors which could serve as tools for deciphering the pathological role of this enzyme, and could potentially form the basis for novel therapeutic strategies targeting mesotrypsin. A virtual screen of the Natural Product Database (NPD) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Drug Database was conducted by high-throughput molecular docking utilizing crystal structures of mesotrypsin. Twelve high-scoring compounds were selected for testing based on lowest free energy docking scores, interaction with key mesotrypsin active site residues, and commercial availability. Diminazene (CID22956468), along with two similar compounds presenting the bis-benzamidine substructure, was validated as a competitive inhibitor of mesotrypsin and other human trypsin isoforms. Diminazene is the most potent small molecule inhibitor of mesotrypsin reported to date with an inhibitory constant (Ki) of 3.6±0.3 μM. Diminazene was subsequently co-crystalized with mesotrypsin and the crystal structure was solved and refined to 1.25 Å resolution. This high resolution crystal structure can now offer a foundation for structure-guided efforts to develop novel and potentially more selective mesotrypsin inhibitors based on similar molecular substructures."
https://openalex.org/W2611296683,"NOTCH receptors participate in cancer cell proliferation and survival. Accumulated evidence indicates that, depending on the cellular context, these receptors can function as oncogenes or as tumor-suppressor genes. The epidermal growth factor–like protein delta-like homolog (DLK)1 acts as a NOTCH inhibitor and is involved in the regulation of normal and tumoral growth. In this work, we focused on the role of DLK1 in the control of breast cancer cell growth, a tumor type in which NOTCH receptors have been shown to play both opposite roles. We found that human DLK1 inhibits NOTCH signaling in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The proliferation rate and invasion capabilities of these cells depended on the level of NOTCH activation and signaling, as regulated by DLK1. High levels of DLK1 expression led to a significant decrease in NOTCH signaling, which was associated with a decrease in breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion. On the contrary, lower levels of NOTCH inhibition, caused by lower levels of DLK1 overexpression, led to enhanced in vitro MDA-MB-231 cell invasion, and to both in vitro and in vivo increased cell proliferation. The data presented in this work suggest that a fine regulation of NOTCH signaling plays an important role in the control of breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion.—Nueda, M.-L., Naranjo, A.-I., Baladrón V., Laborda, J.

Different regions of the normal skin of three different ages (newborn, half-year-old and adult) of yaks were harvested for histological study and thickness measurement. Biopsy samples were taken from the scapula regions of the skin from the same five approximately 1-year-old yaks during the hair cycle (telogen, anagen and catagen). RT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry methods using the mRNA and protein levels were used to detect the expression of HSP27, HSP70 and HSP90. RT-PCR method was used to detect the mRNA expression of CGI-58 and KDF1. The IPP6.0 software was used to analyze the immunohistochemistry and measure the thickness of the skin.The general histological structure of hairy yak skin was similar to other domestic mammals. The unique features included prominent cutaneous vascular plexuses, underdeveloped sweat glands, a large number of nasolabial glands in the nasolabial plate, and hair follicle groups composed of one primary follicle and several secondary follicles. The skin, epidermis and dermis thickness did vary significantly between different body regions and different ages. The thickness of the skin, epidermis and dermis increased from newborn to adult in yaks. Yak skin thickness decreased from dorsally to ventrally on the trunk. The skin on the lateral surface was thicker than the skin on the medial surface on the limbs. HSP27, HSP70 and HSP90 showed different expression patterns during the hair cycle using RT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry methods. The expression of HSP27 mRNA and protein in the anagen stage was the highest, followed by the catagen stage, and the expression in the telogen stage was the lowest. The expression of HSP70 mRNA and protein in the telogen stage was the highest, followed by the anagen stage, and the expression in the catagen stage was the lowest. The expression of HSP90 mRNA and protein in the anagen stage was the highest, followed by the telogen stage, and the expression in the catagen stage was the lowest. HSPs were mainly expressed in the outer root sheath of hair follicle during the hair cycle, also expressed in epidermis, sebaceous gland and sweat gland in the skin of Yak. The expression of CGI-58 mRNA in the anagen stage was the highest, followed by the catagen stage, and the expression in the telogen stage was the lowest. The expression of KDF1 mRNA in the telogen stage was the highest, followed by the catagen stage, and the expression in the anagen stage was the lowest.In this study, we examined and fully described the histology of normal skin in Yak and measured the skin thickness of different ages and different regions in Yak. These data may be useful to better understand and appreciate the adaptability features of yak skin. Our investigation reports the expression patterns of HSPs in yak skin for the first time. The different expression pattern of HSPs during the hair cycle suggests they may play different roles in yak hair follicle biology."
https://openalex.org/W2611272262,"Obesity, a serious health risk factor, is often associated with depression and negatively affects many aspects of life. Injection of a formula comprising phosphatidylcholine (PPC) and deoxycholate (DC) has emerged as an alternative to liposuction in the reduction of local fat deposits. However, the formula component mainly responsible for this effect and the mechanism behind the actions of the components with respect to fat reduction are unknown. Here, we investigate the specific effects of PPC and DC on adipocyte viability. When exposed to PPC or DC, 3T3L1 preadipocytes and differentiated adipocytes showed dose dependent decrease in cell viability. Interestingly, while DC mediated cell death was non-specific to both preadipocytes and adipocytes, PPC specifically induced a decrease in mature adipocyte viability, but had less effect on preadipocytes. Injection of PPC and DC into inguinal fat pads caused reduction in size. PPC injections preferentially decreased gene expression in mature adipocytes, while a strong inflammatory response was elicited by DC injection. In line with the decreased adipocyte viability, exposure of differentiated adipocytes to PPC resulted in triglyceride release, with a minimal effect on free fatty acids release, suggesting that its fat-reducing effect mediated mainly through the induction of adipocyte cell death rather than lipolysis. Taken together, it appears that PPC specifically affects adipocytes, and has less effect on preadipocyte viability. It can therefore be a promising agent to selectively reduce adipose tissue mass."

In a well-defined mono-center population, we measured cytokines and chemokines in paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Methods Consecutive patients with AD (n = 30), stable mild cognitive impairment (SMCI, n = 11), other dementias (n = 11), and healthy controls (n = 18) were included. None of the subjects was treated with glucocorticoids, cholinesterase inhibitors, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Serum and CSF concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-12/23 p40, IL-15, IL-16, vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), and three chemokines were measured using a multiplex panel. Results After correction for multiple comparisons, only CSF IL-12/23 p40 concentration differed significantly between the total patient group (n = 52) and controls (n = 18; p = 0.002). Further analyses showed that CSF IL-12/23 p40 concentration was decreased in all patient subgroups (AD, other dementias, and SMCI) compared to healthy controls (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, and p < 0.05, respectively). In the total study population (n = 70), CSF IL-12/23 p40 concentrations correlated positively with CSF concentrations of β-amyloid1-42 (Aβ1–42) and phosphorylated tau protein (P-tau) whereas in AD patients (n = 30), CSF IL-12/23 p40 only correlated positively with CSF P-Tau (r = 0.46, p = 0.01). Conclusions Most cytokines and chemokines were similar in patients and controls, but CSF IL-12/23 subunit p40 concentration was decreased in patients with cognitive impairment, and correlated with markers of AD disease status. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of CSF IL-12/23 p40 in other dementias and SMCI."
https://openalex.org/W2611686615,"It is well known that glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) has antidiabetic action. It has 2 distinct functions, an insulinotropic effect dependent on GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and an insulinomimetic effect independent of GLP-1R. However, use of GLP-1 in vivo is limited by its short half-life. Therefore, our lab designed PGLP-1, a novel 2-function candidate peptide as a potential substitute. Using a streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic mouse model, we demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that PGLP-1 had insulinotropic actions dependent on GLP-1R and insulinomimetic functions independent of GLP-1R. PGLP-1 treatment increased islet β-cell mass, plasma insulin, and C-peptide levels and Ki-67-immunoreactive β-cell numbers, verifying that PGLP-1 can work as a short GLP-1R agonist, similar to commercially available exendin-4. Additionally, PGLP-1 improved insulin sensitivity, inhibited gluconeogenesis by increasing expression of AMPK and receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2 (SHP), and inhibited body weight loss by inhibiting β-oxidation, suggesting that PGLP-1 had insulinomimetic action. Taken together, these data indicated that PGLP-1, as a dual-function peptide, improved glycemic control and inhibited body weight loss, suggesting it could be useful for type 1 diabetes mellitus patients as an adjunctive therapy to insulin.-Gao, H., Zhao, Q., Song, Z., Yang, Z., Wu, Y., Tang, S., Alahdal, M., Zhang, Y., Jin, L.

This study applied electroencephalography (EEG) in healthy subjects and investigated how high a concentration of oxygen in inhaled air (i.e., normobaric hyperoxia) alters brain activity under resting-state and task-evoked conditions. Study 1 investigated its impact on resting EEG and revealed that hyperoxia suppressed α (8-13Hz) and β (14-35Hz) band power (by 15.6±2.3% and 14.1±3.1%, respectively), but did not change the δ (1-3Hz), θ (4-7Hz), and γ (36-75Hz) bands. Sham control experiments did not result in such changes. Study 2 reproduced these findings, and, furthermore, examined the effect of hyperoxia on visual stimulation event-related potentials (ERP). It was found that the main peaks of visual ERP, specifically N1 and P2, were both delayed during hyperoxia compared to normoxia (P = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively). In contrast, the amplitude of the peaks did not show a change. Our results suggest that hyperoxia has a pronounced effect on brain neural activity, for both resting-state and task-evoked potentials."
https://openalex.org/W2610236812,"In Indonesia, endoscopy services are limited and studies about gastric mucosal status by using pepsinogens (PGs) are rare. We measured PG levels, and calculated the best cutoff and predictive values for discriminating gastric mucosal status among ethnic groups in Indonesia. We collected gastric biopsy specimens and sera from 233 patients with dyspepsia living in three Indonesian islands. When ≥5.5 U/mL was used as the best cutoff value of Helicobacter pylori antibody titer, 8.6% (20 of 233) were positive for H. pylori infection. PG I and II levels were higher among smokers, and PG I was higher in alcohol drinkers than in their counterparts. PG II level was significantly higher, whereas PG I/II ratios were lower in H. pylori-positive than in H. pylori-negative patients. PG I/II ratios showed a significant inverse correlation with the inflammation and atrophy scores of the antrum. The best cutoff values of PG I/II were 4.05 and 3.55 for discriminating chronic and atrophic gastritis, respectively. PG I, PG II, and PG I/II ratios were significantly lower in subjects from Bangli than in those from Makassar and Surabaya, and concordant with the ABC group distribution; however, group D (H. pylori negative/PG positive) was the lowest in subjects from Bangli. In conclusion, validation of indirect methods is necessary before their application. We confirmed that serum PG level is a useful biomarker determining chronic gastritis, but a modest sensitivity for atrophic gastritis in Indonesia. The ABC method should be used with caution in areas with a low prevalence of H. pylori."
https://openalex.org/W2610639700,"Background Pulmonary hypertension is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Since pulmonary artery (PA) size increases in pulmonary hypertension, we measured PA cross-sectional area using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to test the hypothesis that pulmonary hyperinflation due to gas trapping is associated with PA cross-sectional area in COPD. Methods The MESA COPD Study recruited participants with COPD and controls from two population-based cohort studies ages 50–79 years with 10 or more pack-years and free of clinical cardiovascular disease. Body plethysmography was performed according to standard criteria. Cardiac MRI was performed at functional residual capacity to measure the cross-sectional area of the main PA. Percent emphysema was defined as the percentage of lung voxels less than -950 Hounsfield units as assessed via x-ray computed tomography. Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, height, weight, race-ethnicity, the forced expiratory volume in one second, smoking status, pack-years, lung function, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction and percent emphysema. Results Among 106 participants, mean residual volume was 1.98±0.71 L and the mean PA cross-sectional area was 7.23±1.72 cm2. A one standard deviation increase in residual volume was independently associated with an increase in main PA cross-sectional area of 0.55 cm2 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.92; p = 0.003). In contrast, there was no evidence for an association with percent emphysema or total lung capacity. Conclusion Increased residual volume was associated with a larger PA in COPD, suggesting that gas trapping may contribute to pulmonary hypertension in COPD."
https://openalex.org/W2610940970,"Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-MSI) allows us to investigate the distribution of lipid molecules within tissues. We used MALDI-MSI to identify prognostic gangliosides in tissue sections of rat intracranial allografts of rat glioma and mouse intracranial xenografts of human medulloblastoma. In the healthy adult rodent brain, GM1 and GD1 were the main types of glycolipids. Both gangliosides were absent in both intracranial transplants. The ganglioside GM3 was not present in the healthy adult brain but was highly expressed in rat glioma allografts. In combination with tandem mass spectrometry GM3 (d18:1/C24:0) was identified as the most abundant ganglioside species in the glioma allotransplant. By contrast, mouse xenografts of human medulloblastoma were characterized by prominent expression of the ganglioside GM2 (d18:0/C18:0). Together, these data demonstrate that tissue-based MALDI-MSI of gangliosides is able to discriminate between different brain tumors and may be a useful clinical tool for their classification and grading."
https://openalex.org/W2611008525,"Japanese Encephalitis (JE) has caused repeated outbreaks in endemic pockets of India. This study was conducted in Kushinagar, a highly endemic district, to understand the human-animal-ecosystem interactions, and the drivers that influence disease transmission. Utilizing the ecosystems approach, a cross-sectional, descriptive study, employing mixed methods design was employed. Four villages (two with pig-rearing and two without) were randomly selected from a high, a medium and a low burden (based on case counts) block of Kushinagar. Children, pigs and vectors were sampled from these villages. A qualitative arm was incorporated to explain the findings from the quantitative surveys. All human serum samples were screened for JE-specific IgM using MAC ELISA and negative samples for JE RNA by rRT-PCR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In pigs, IgG ELISA and rRT-PCR for viral RNA were used. Of the 242 children tested, 24 tested positive by either rRT-PCR or MAC ELISA; in pigs, 38 out of the 51 pigs were positive. Of the known vectors, Culex vishnui was most commonly isolated across all biotopes. Analysis of 15 blood meals revealed human blood in 10 samples. Univariable analysis showed that gender, religion, lack of indoor residual spraying of insecticides in the past year, indoor vector density (all species), and not being vaccinated against JE in children were significantly associated with JE positivity. In multivariate analysis, only male gender remained as a significant risk factor. Based on previous estimates of symptomatic: asymptomatic cases of JE, we estimate that there should have been 618 cases from Kushinagar, although only 139 were reported. Vaccination of children and vector control measures emerged as major control activities; they had very poor coverage in the studied villages. In addition, lack of awareness about the cause of JE, lack of faith in the conventional medical healthcare system and multiple referral levels causing delay in diagnosis and treatment emerged as factors likely to result in adverse clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2611458731,"Prospective parents widely use education to gain information about, e.g., labour and parenting skills. It is unknown if antenatal education in small classes is more beneficial for parenting stress and parenting alliance compared with other types of antenatal education. In the present randomised trial, we examined the effect of antenatal education in small classes versus auditorium-based lectures on perceived stress, parenting stress, and parenting alliance. A total of 1,766 pregnant women were randomised to receive: antenatal education in small classes three times in pregnancy and one time after delivery, each session lasted 2.5 hours, versus standard care consisting of two times two hours auditorium-based lectures. Previous analysis of the primary outcome showed no difference between intervention and control group. Here we conduct an exploratory analysis of three secondary outcomes. Effects of the interventions on parents’ global feelings of stress at 37 weeks gestation and nine weeks and six months postpartum and parenting stress nine weeks and six months postpartum were examined using linear regression analyses and mixed models with repeated measurements. The effect on parenting alliance six months postpartum was examined using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Antenatal education in small classes had a small beneficial main effect on global feelings of stress six months postpartum and a statistically significant interaction between time and group favoring antenatal education in small classes. The P values of intervention effects on parenting stress and parenting alliance were all larger than the threshold value (0.05)."
https://openalex.org/W2611749459,"The eukaryotic group II chaperonin, the chaperonin-containing t-complex polypeptide 1 (CCT), plays an important role in cytosolic proteostasis. It has been estimated that as much as 10% of cytosolic proteins interact with CCT during their folding process. CCT is composed of 8 different paralogous subunits. Due to its complicated structure, molecular and biochemical investigations of CCT have been difficult. In this study, we constructed an expression system for CCT from a thermophilic fungus, Chaetomium thermophilum (CtCCT), by using E. coli as a host. As expected, we obtained recombinant CtCCT with a relatively high yield, and it exhibited fairly high thermal stability. We showed the advantages of the overproduction system by characterizing CtCCT variants containing ATPase-deficient subunits. For diffracted X-ray tracking experiment, we removed all surface exposed cysteine residues, and added cysteine residues at the tip of helical protrusions of selected two subunits. Gold nanocrystals were attached onto CtCCTs via gold-thiol bonds and applied for the analysis by diffracted X-ray tracking. Irrespective of the locations of cysteines, it was shown that ATP binding induces tilting motion followed by rotational motion in the CtCCT molecule, like the archaeal group II chaperonins. When gold nanocrystals were attached onto two subunits in the high ATPase activity hemisphere, the CtCCT complex exhibited a fairly rapid response to the motion. In contrast, the response of CtCCT, which had gold nanocrystals attached to the low-activity hemisphere, was slow. These results clearly support the possibility that ATP-dependent conformational change starts with the high-affinity hemisphere and progresses to the low-affinity hemisphere."
https://openalex.org/W2611328898,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) close to the gain-of-function substitution, Asn(107)Ile (rs324981, A>T), in Neuropeptide S Receptor 1 (NPSR1) have been associated with asthma. Furthermore, a functional SNP (rs4751440, G>C) in Neuropeptide S (NPS) encodes a Val(6)Leu substitution on the mature peptide that results in reduced bioactivity. We sought to examine the effects of different combinations of these NPS and NPSR1 variants on downstream signaling and genetic risk of asthma. In transfected cells, the magnitude of NPSR1-induced activation of cAMP/PKA signal transduction pathways and downstream gene expression was dependent on the combination of the NPS and NPSR1 variants with NPS-Val(6)/NPSR1-Ile(107) resulting in strongest and NPS-Leu(6)/NPSR1-Asn(107) in weakest effects, respectively. One or two copies of the NPS-Leu(6) (rs4751440) were associated with physician-diagnosed childhood asthma (OR: 0.67, 95%CI 0.49–0.92, p = 0.01) and together with two other linked NPS variants (rs1931704 and rs10830123) formed a protective haplotype (p = 0.008) in the Swedish birth cohort BAMSE (2033 children). NPS rs10830123 showed epistasis with NPSR1 rs324981 encoding Asn(107)Ile (p = 0.009) in BAMSE and with the linked NPSR1 rs17199659 (p = 0.005) in the German MAGIC/ISAAC II cohort (1454 children). In conclusion, NPS variants modify asthma risk and should be considered in genetic association studies of NPSR1 with asthma and other complex diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2611275663,"Purpose Clinical test batteries for evaluation of knee function after injury to the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) should be valid and feasible, while reliably capturing the outcome of rehabilitation. There is currently a lack of consensus as to which of the many available assessment tools for knee function that should be included. The present aim was to use a statistical approach to investigate the contribution of frequently used tests to avoid redundancy, and filter them down to a proposed comprehensive and yet feasible test battery for long-term evaluation after ACL injury. Methods In total 48 outcome variables related to knee function, all potentially relevant for a long-term follow-up, were included from a cross-sectional study where 70 ACL-injured (17–28 years post injury) individuals were compared to 33 controls. Cluster analysis and logistic regression were used to group variables and identify an optimal test battery, from which a summarized estimator of knee function representing various functional aspects was derived. Results As expected, several variables were strongly correlated, and the variables also fell into logical clusters with higher within-correlation (max ρ = 0.61) than between clusters (max ρ = 0.19). An extracted test battery with just four variables assessing one-leg balance, isokinetic knee extension strength and hop performance (one-leg hop, side hop) were mathematically combined to an estimator of knee function, which acceptably classified ACL-injured individuals and controls. This estimator, derived from objective measures, correlated significantly with self-reported function, e.g. Lysholm score (ρ = 0.66; p<0.001). Conclusions The proposed test battery, based on a solid statistical approach, includes assessments which are all clinically feasible, while also covering complementary aspects of knee function. Similar test batteries could be determined for earlier phases of ACL rehabilitation or to enable longitudinal monitoring. Such developments, established on a well-grounded consensus of measurements, would facilitate comparisons of studies and enable evidence-based rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W2611426660,"End-stage heart failure patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with/without cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT-D) often require heart transplantation (HTPL) as a last-resort treatment. We aimed to assess the frequency and clinical impact of retained ICD lead materials in HTPL patients. In this retrospective single center study, we examined the clinical records and chest radiographs of patients with ICD and CRT-D who underwent HTPL between January 1992 and July 2014. Of 40 patients with ICD and CRT-D at HTPL, 19 (47.5%) patients had retained ICD lead materials within the central venous system. Retained ICD lead materials following HTPL were more frequently noted in patients with longer implantation durations until HTPL. None of the patients underwent extraction procedures after HTPL. All patients were asymptomatic and did not exhibit significant complications or death related to the retained ICD lead materials. Seven (7/40, 17.5%) patients without any retained ICD lead materials underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during the follow-up period (median, 29.5 months); none of the patients with retained lead materials were given MRI. Considering the common use of MRI in HTPL patients, further studies on the prophylactic extraction of retained ICD lead materials and safety of MRI in these patients are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2610669464,"Legionella pneumophila contaminates man-made water systems and creates numerous exposure risks for Legionnaires' Disease. Because copper/silver ionization is commonly used to control L. pneumophila, its mechanisms of metal response and detoxification are of significant interest. Here we describe an L. pneumophila operon with significant similarity to the GIG operon of Cupriavidus metallidurans. The Legionella GIG operon is present in a subset of strains and has been acquired as part of the ICE-βox 65-kB integrative conjugative element. We assessed GIG promoter activity following exposure of L. pneumophila to multiple concentrations of HAuCl4, CuSO4 and AgNO3. At 37°C, control stationary phase cultures exhibited GIG promoter activity. This activity increased significantly in response to 20 and 50uM HAuCl4 and CuSO4 but not in response to AgNO3. Conversely, at 26°C, cultures exhibited decreased promoter response to copper. GIG promoter activity was also induced by HAuCl4 or CuSO4 during early biofilm establishment at both temperatures. When an L. pneumophila GIG promoter construct was transformed into E. coli DH5α, cultures showed baseline expression levels that did not increase following metal addition. Analysis of L. pneumophila transcriptional regulatory mutants suggested that GIG up-regulation in the presence of metal ions may be influenced by the stationary phase sigma factor, RpoS."
https://openalex.org/W2610186946,"Periploca forrestii Schltr has been used as a Chinese folk medicine for the treatment of rheumatism, arthralgia and fractures. However, the anti-arthritic activity of Periploca forrestii saponin (PFS) and the active compound has still not been revealed. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects and mechanisms of PFS on collagen type II (CII) collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice. We sought to investigate whether PFS and Periplocin could regulate osteoclastogenesis, and if so, further investigation on its mechanism of action.Arthritis was induced in female BALB/c mice by CIA method. PFS was administered at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight once daily for five weeks. The effects of treatment in mice were assessed by histological and biochemical evaluation in sera and paws. Anti-osteoclastogenic action of PFS and Periplocin was identified using an osteoclast formation model induced by RANKL.PFS ameliorated paw erythema and swelling, inhibited bone erosion in ankle joint histopathological examination. PFS treatment resulted in decreased IgG2a, and increased IgG1 levels in the serum of CIA mice. Decreased TNF-α, and increased interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-22 levels were also found in PFS-treated mice. PFS inhibited the I-κBα phosphorylation, blocked nuclear factor (NF)-κB/p65 phosphorylation and abrogated AP-1/c-Fos activity. PFS downregulated toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, STAT3 and MMP-9 expression in CIA mice and RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. PFS and Periplocin inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast formation in a dose dependent manner within nongrowth inhibitory concentration, and PFS decreased osteoclastogenesis-related marker expression, including cathepsin K and MMP-9.This study revealed that the protective mechanism of PFS on CIA was associated with regulatory effects on proinflammatory factors and further on the crosstalk between NF-κB and c-Fos/AP-1 in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, PFS is a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of RA, evidencing the need to conduct further studies that can identify their active components in treating and preventing RA."
https://openalex.org/W2611670887,"Objective The aim of this cross-sectional in vitro study was to evaluate the mucosal surfaces of healthy maxillary sinuses, explore different forms of bacterial microorganism colonies present on the mucous membrane, and determine a mucosal surface area they occupy. Methods Samples of the maxillary sinus mucosa were collected from 30 healthy patients (M = 11; F = 19). The material was obtained during the Le Fort I osteotomy performed during corrective jaw surgery. The morphological and morphometric analysis of sinus mucosa and bacterial film that was grown on it was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as well as imaging software. Results Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed the presence of different bacterium and bacteria-like structures in all the analyzed samples. In most cases, the bacterial film was mostly composed of diplococci-like and streptococci-like structures on the mucosa of the paranasal sinus. In any case, the mucous layer did not cover the whole lining of the evaluated sample. Each colony consists of more than 20 single bacterial cells, which has grown in aggregates. Conclusions Under the conditions of normal homeostasis of the body, the maxillary sinuses present diverse bacterial colonization. The bacteria are dispersed or concentrated in single microcolonies of the biofilm on the border of the mucous covering the ciliary epithelium. There is no uniform layer of the biofilm covering the mucosa of the maxillary sinuses. Because the biofilm is detected on healthy individuals sinus mucosa, the clinical question if it may become pathogenic is unclear and require an explanation."
https://openalex.org/W2611640318,"Triploid wheat hybrids between tetraploid wheat and Aegilops tauschii sometimes show abnormal growth phenotypes, and the growth abnormalities inhibit generation of wheat synthetic hexaploids. In type II necrosis, one of the growth abnormalities, necrotic cell death accompanied by marked growth repression occurs only under low temperature conditions. At normal temperature, the type II necrosis lines show grass-clump dwarfism with no necrotic symptoms, excess tillers, severe dwarfism and delayed flowering. Here, we report comparative expression analyses to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the temperature-dependent phenotypic plasticity in the triploid wheat hybrids. We compared gene and small RNA expression profiles in crown tissues to characterize the temperature-dependent phenotypic plasticity. No up-regulation of defense-related genes was observed under the normal temperature, and down-regulation of wheat APETALA1-like MADS-box genes, considered to act as flowering promoters, was found in the grass-clump dwarf lines. Some microRNAs, including miR156, were up-regulated, whereas the levels of transcripts of the miR156 target genes SPLs, known to inhibit tiller and branch number, were reduced in crown tissues of the grass-clump dwarf lines at the normal temperature. Unusual expression of the miR156/SPLs module could explain the grass-clump dwarf phenotype. Dramatic alteration of gene expression profiles, including miRNA levels, in crown tissues is associated with the temperature-dependent phenotypic plasticity in type II necrosis/grass-clump dwarf wheat hybrids."
https://openalex.org/W2610778458,"The cavity expansion theory is most widely used to predict the depth of penetration of concrete targets. The main purpose of this work is to clarify the differences between the spherical and cylindrical cavity expansion models and their scope of application in predicting the penetration depths of concrete targets. The factors that influence the dynamic cavity expansion process of concrete materials were first examined. Based on numerical results, the relationship between expansion pressure and velocity was established. Then the parameters in the Forrestal's formula were fitted to have a convenient and effective prediction of the penetration depth. Results showed that both the spherical and cylindrical cavity expansion models can accurately predict the depth of penetration when the initial velocity is lower than 800 m/s. However, the prediction accuracy decreases with the increasing of the initial velocity and diameters of the projectiles. Based on our results, it can be concluded that when the initial velocity is higher than the critical velocity, the cylindrical cavity expansion model performs better than the spherical cavity expansion model in predicting the penetration depth, while when the initial velocity is lower than the critical velocity the conclusion is quite the contrary. This work provides a basic principle for selecting the spherical or cylindrical cavity expansion model to predict the penetration depth of concrete targets."
