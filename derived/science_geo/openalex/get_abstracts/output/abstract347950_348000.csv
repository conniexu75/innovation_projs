https://openalex.org/W2144974645,Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease with a strong genetic component. We analyzed the genomic copy number polymorphism of the beta-defensin region on human chromosome 8 in 179 Dutch individuals with psoriasis and 272 controls and in 319 German individuals with psoriasis and 305 controls. Comparisons in both cohorts showed a significant association between higher genomic copy number for beta-defensin genes and risk of psoriasis.

Here we have analyzed the gene encoding the trypsin-degrading enzyme chymotrypsin C (CTRC) in German subjects with idiopathic or hereditary chronic pancreatitis. Two alterations in this gene, p.R254W and p.K247_R254del, were significantly overrepresented in the pancreatitis group, being present in 30 of 901 (3.3%) affected individuals but only 21 of 2,804 (0.7%) controls (odds ratio (OR) = 4.6; confidence interval (CI) = 2.6–8.0; P = 1.3 × 10−7). A replication study identified these two variants in 10 of 348 (2.9%) individuals with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis but only 3 of 432 (0.7%) subjects with alcoholic liver disease (OR = 4.2; CI = 1.2–15.5; P = 0.02). CTRC variants were also found in 10 of 71 (14.1%) Indian subjects with tropical pancreatitis but only 1 of 84 (1.2%) healthy controls (OR = 13.6; CI = 1.7–109.2; P = 0.0028). Functional analysis of the CTRC variants showed impaired activity and/or reduced secretion. The results indicate that loss-of-function alterations in CTRC predispose to pancreatitis by diminishing its protective trypsin-degrading activity."

Here, we report technology for covalent, specific tagging of cellular proteins with chemical probes. Through rational design, we redirected a microbial lipoic acid ligase (LplA) to specifically attach an alkyl azide onto an engineered LplA acceptor peptide (LAP). The alkyl azide was then selectively derivatized with cyclo-octyne conjugates to various probes. We labeled LAP fusion proteins expressed in living mammalian cells with Cy3, Alexa Fluor 568 and biotin. We also combined LplA labeling with our previous biotin ligase labeling, to simultaneously image the dynamics of two different receptors, coexpressed in the same cell. Our methodology should provide general access to biochemical and imaging studies of cell surface proteins, using small fluorophores introduced via a short peptide tag."

https://openalex.org/W2042482078,"Meiotic recombination between highly similar duplicated sequences (nonallelic homologous recombination, NAHR) generates deletions, duplications, inversions and translocations, and it is responsible for genetic diseases known as 'genomic disorders', most of which are caused by altered copy number of dosage-sensitive genes. NAHR hot spots have been identified within some duplicated sequences. We have developed sperm-based assays to measure the de novo rate of reciprocal deletions and duplications at four NAHR hot spots. We used these assays to dissect the relative rates of NAHR between different pairs of duplicated sequences. We show that (i) these NAHR hot spots are specific to meiosis, (ii) deletions are generated at a higher rate than their reciprocal duplications in the male germline and (iii) some of these genomic disorders are likely to have been underascertained clinically, most notably that resulting from the duplication of 7q11, the reciprocal of the deletion causing Williams-Beuren syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1976081253,"Cavin (PTRF) has been shown to be a highly abundant protein component of caveolae, but its functional role there is unknown. Here, we confirm that cavin co-localizes with caveolin-1 in adipocytes by confocal microscopy and co-distributes with caveolin-1 in lipid raft fractions by sucrose gradient flotation. However, cavin does not directly associate with caveolin-1 as solubilization of caveolae disrupts their interaction. Cholesterol depletion with beta-cyclodextrin causes a significant down-regulation of cavin from plasma membrane lipid raft fractions. Overexpression of cavin in HEK293-Cav-1 cells and knockdown of cavin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes enhances and diminishes caveolin-1 levels, respectively, indicating an important role for cavin in maintaining the level of caveolin-1. A truncated form of cavin, eGFP-cavin-1-322, which lacks 74 amino acids from the C-terminal, reveals a microtubular network localization by confocal microscopy. Disruption of cytoskeletal elements with latrunculin B or nocodazole diminishes cavin expression without affecting the caveolin-1 amount. We propose that the presence of cavin on the inside surface of caveolae stabilizes these structures, probably through interaction with the cytoskeleton, and cavin therefore plays an important role in caveolae formation and organization."
https://openalex.org/W2072362263,"Tumor suppressor p53-dependent stress response pathways play an important role in cell fate determination. In this study, we have found that glucose depletion promotes the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase catalytic subunit α (AMPKα) in association with a significant up-regulation of p53, thereby inducing p53-dependent apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Thymocytes prepared from glucose-depleted wild-type mice but not from p53-deficient mice underwent apoptosis, which was accompanied by a remarkable phosphorylation of AMPKα and a significant induction of p53 as well as pro-apoptotic Bax. Similar results were also obtained in human osteosarcoma-derived U2OS cells bearing wild-type p53 following glucose starvation. Of note, glucose deprivation led to a significant accumulation of p53 phosphorylated at Ser-46, but not at Ser-15 and Ser-20, and a transcriptional induction of p53 as well as proapoptotic p53 AIP1. Small interference RNA-mediated knockdown of p53 caused an inhibition of apoptosis following glucose depletion. Additionally, apoptosis triggered by glucose deprivation was markedly impaired by small interference RNA-mediated depletion of AMPKα. Under our experimental conditions, down-regulation of AMPKα caused an attenuation of p53 accumulation and its phosphorylation at Ser-46. In support of these observations, enforced expression of AMPKα led to apoptosis and resulted in an induction of p53 at protein and mRNA levels. Furthermore, p53 promoter region responded to AMPKα and glucose deprivation as judged by luciferase reporter assay. Taken together, our present findings suggest that AMPK-dependent transcriptional induction and phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-46 play a crucial role in the induction of apoptosis under carbon source depletion.

Chem. 1973; 248: 378-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated that AMPK is widely expressed and exists as a heterotrimeric complex, which consists of a catalytic subunit (α) and two regulatory subunits (β and γ). The mammalian genome contains seven AMPK genes encoding two α (α1 and α2), two β (β1 and β2), and three γ (γ1, γ2, and γ3) isoforms (3Rutter G.A. Da Silva Xavier G. Leclerc I. Biochem.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5479-5487Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). The catalytic α subunit is composed of three functional domains, including an NH2-terminal Ser/Thr protein kinase domain, a central auto-inhibitory region, and a COOH-terminal regulatory subunit-binding domain. AMPK acts as an intracellular energy sensor by monitoring cellular energy levels. For example, AMPK becomes activated by the tumor suppressor LKB1 complex-mediated phosphorylation at Thr-172 in response to certain energy-depleting stresses such as glucose deprivation, hypoxia, and oxidative stress, which increase the intracellular AMP:ATP ratio (6Hardie D.G.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). Upon activation, AMPK down-regulates the ATP consuming metabolic pathways and activates the energy-generating processes through phosphorylating the primary targets involved in energy metabolism, thereby maintaining energy balance within cells (4Carling D.

Pro-apoptotic p53 is a founding member of the p53 tumor suppressor family and acts as a critical regulator of many cellular processes such as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (12Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5850) Google Scholar). p53 is frequently mutated in over 50% of human tumors (13Caron de Fromentel C. Soussi T.

McArthur M.J. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Butel J.S. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar). p53 acts as a nuclear sequence-specific transcription factor and transactivates its numerous target genes implicated in cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death, including p21WAF1, Bax, Puma, Noxa, and p53 AIP1. Its pro-apoptotic function is closely linked to its DNA binding activity. Indeed, over 90% of the p53 mutation is detected within its sequence-specific DNA-binding domain (13Caron de Fromentel C. Soussi T. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1992; 4: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 14Greenblatt M.S. Bennett W.P. Hollstein M. Harris C.C.

Intracellular p53 protein levels are tightly regulated predominantly through the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation pathway. MDM2, which interacts with the NH2-terminal transactivation domain of p53 and inhibits its transcriptional activity, is one of the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases for p53 (17Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar, 18Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar). In response to various types of cellular stress, including DNA damage, hypoxia, nucleotide pool reduction, and thermal shock, p53 is induced to be stabilized as well as activated in the cell nucleus, and thereby plays a key role in the regulation of cell fate determination (19Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 20Sionov R.V. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6145-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 21Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that cells treated with low glucose arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle in association with a significant activation of AMPK (22Jones R.G. Plas D.R. Kubek S. Buzzai M. Mu J. Xu Y. Birnbaum M.J. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 283-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). According to their results, AMPK-mediated cell cycle arrest in response to low glucose required the phosphorylation of tumor suppressor p53 at Ser-15. Because stress-induced phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15, which disrupts the p53-MDM2 interaction, enhances its activity as well as stability (19Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 20Sionov R.V. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6145-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 21Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar), it is likely that p53 plays an important role in the regulation of cell cycle arrest caused by glucose limitation. Indeed, p53-deficient cells failed to arrest under low glucose conditions (22Jones R.G. Plas D.R. Kubek S. Buzzai M. Mu J. Xu Y. Birnbaum M.J. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 283-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, activation of AMPK in human hepatocellular carcinoma-derived HepG2 cells bearing wild-type p53 resulted in G1 cell cycle arrest through stabilization of p53 (23Imamura K. Ogura T. Kishimoto A. Kaminishi M. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Previously, Stefanelli et al. (24Stefanelli C. Stanic I. Bonavita F. Flamigni F. Pignatti C. Guarnieri C. Caldarera C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) described that AMPK has a protective role against thymocyte apoptosis in response to dexamethasone treatment. In this study, we have found that glucose deprivation induces phosphorylation of AMPKα and promotes p53-dependent apoptotic cell death in vivo and in vitro. Under our experimental conditions, p53 was induced in response to glucose depletion at mRNA and at protein levels. Our present findings suggest that AMPK acts as a metabolic sensor to determine cell fate through the activation of pro-apoptotic p53. Mice–Six-week-old male c57BL/6 mice (23–24 g), which were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Tokyo, Japan), were housed in an animal facility maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle at a constant temperature of 22 ± 1 °C and given free access to food and water ad libitum. For starvation, food was withdrawn from the cages at the onset of the dark cycle for the indicated times, whereas access to water was allowed. All experiments with these mice were carried out with the approval of the Chiba Cancer Center Experimental Animal Care and Use Committee. Cell Lines and Transfection–Human osteosarcoma-derived U2OS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Human lung carcinoma H1299 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS plus antibiotics mixture. These cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Where indicated, U2OS cells were cultured in glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS. For transient transfection, U2OS and H1299 cells were transfected with the indicated combinations of the expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was used as a blank plasmid to balance the amount of DNA introduced in transient transfection. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR–Total RNA was prepared from the indicated cells by using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol, and reverse-transcribed with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The resultant cDNA was amplified by PCR with rTaq DNA polymerase (Takara, Ohtsu, Japan) using the following primers: p53, 5′-CTGCCCTCAACAAGATGTTTTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTATCTGAGCAGCGCTCATGG-3′ (reverse); p21WAF1, 5′-ATGAAATTCACCCCCTTTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCTAGGCTGTGCTCACTTC-3′ (reverse); Bax, 5′-TTTGCTTCAGGGTTTCATCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGTTGAAGTTGCCGTCAGA-3′ (reverse); p53 AIP1, 5′-TGGCTCCAGGAAGGAAAGGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCTTTCTGCAGACAGGGCC-3′ (reverse); AMPKα1, 5′-CAGGGACTGCTACTCCACAGAGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTTGAGCCTCAGCATCTGAA-3′ (reverse); AMPKα2, 5′-CAACTGCAGAGAGCCATTCACTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGTGAAACTGAAGACAATGTGCTT-3′ (reverse); and GAPDH, 5′-ACCTGACCTGCCGTCTAGAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ (reverse). The expression of GAPDH was measured as an internal control. Immunoblotting–Cells were scraped off the plates and transferred into the microcentrifuge tubes. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol,1% Triton X-100, a commercial protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 30 min on ice, and subjected to a brief sonication for 10 s at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min to remove insoluble materials. The protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The equal amounts of protein (20 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The transferred membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 at 4 °C overnight. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with monoclonal anti-p53 (DO-1; Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA), monoclonal anti-Bax (6A7; eBioscience, San Diego, CA), polyclonal anti-phospho-p53 at Ser-15 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), polyclonal anti-phospho-p53 at Ser-20 (Cell Signaling), polyclonal anti-phospho-p53 at Ser-46 (Cell Signaling), polyclonal anti-p21WAF1 (H-164; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal anti-AMPKα (Cell Signaling), polyclonal anti-phospho-AMPKα (Cell Signaling), polyclonal anti-PARP (Cell Signaling), or with polyclonal anti-actin (20Sionov R.V.

After incubation with primary antibodies, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Cell Signaling) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblots were visualized by ECL detection reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation–At the indicated time points after glucose depletion, whole cell lysates prepared from U2OS cells were pre-cleared with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads for 90 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were incubated with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the reaction mixtures were mixed with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were eluted with SDS-sample buffer, and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy–U2OS cells were cultured in the absence of glucose. At the indicated times after glucose deprivation, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature, and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking, cells were washed in PBS and incubated with polyclonal anti-phospho-AMPKα and monoclonal anti-p53 or with polyclonal anti-phospho-AMPKα and monoclonal anti-nucleolin antibodies (StressGen Biotechnologies, Cambridge, UK) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by the incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. The specific fluorescence was observed by using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Flow Cytometry–After glucose deprivation, both floating and attached cells were collected by low speed centrifugation and washed in PBS. The cells were treated with 500 μg/ml of RNase A (Sigma) and subsequently stained with 50 μg/ml of propidium iodide (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. Then the DNA content indicated by propidium iodide staining was analyzed by FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Luciferase Reporter Assay–p53-deficient H1299 cells were plated in 12-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells/well and transiently co-transfected with a constant amount of a luciferase reporter construct driven by the p53 promoter (100 ng) and 10 ng of Renilla luciferase expression plasmid (pRL-TK) together with or without the increasing amounts of the expression plasmids for AMPKα1 plus AMPK α2 (50, 100, or 200 ng). For all transfections, the total DNA amounts were kept constant (510 ng) using empty parental plasmid. Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed, and their luciferase activities were measured by dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Results represent an average firefly luciferase value after normalization to Renilla luciferase signal. Each experiment was performed at least three times by triplicates. Construction of the Expression Plasmids for AMPKα1 and AMPKα2–To generate the expression plasmids for AMPKα1 and AMPKα2, we employed PCR-based amplification using cDNA prepared from U2OS cells as a template. For AMPKα1, the 5′-part of the entire coding region was amplified by PCR using the following primer sequences: 5′-GGAATTCCATGCGCAGACTCAGTTCCTG-3′ and 5′-CTGCAGCATATGTTTCAAAAG-3′, which include EcoRI and PstI restriction sites, respectively. The 3′-part of the entire coding region was also amplified by PCR using the following primer sequences: 5′-CTGCAGGTGGATCCCATGAAG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGGTTATTGTGCAAGAATTT-3′, which contain PstI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively. The resultant 5′- and 3′-parts of the entire coding regions were digested completely with EcoRI and PstI or with PstI and XhoI, respectively, and subcloned into EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to give pcDNA3-AMPKα1. For AMPKα2, the 5′-part of the entire coding region was amplified by PCR using the following primer sequences: 5′-CGGGATCCCGATGGCTGAGAGAAGCAGAAGC-3′ and 5′-ACTAGTTCTCAGAAATTCAC-3′, which include BamHI and SpeI restriction sites, respectively. The 3′-part of the entire coding region was also amplified by PCR using the following primer sequences: 5′-ACTAGTTGCGGATCTCCAAATTATAC-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCCTCAACGGGCTAAAGTAGTAGTAATC-3′, which contain SpeI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively. The amplified PCR products corresponding to 5′-or3′-part of the entire coding region were treated with BamHI and SpeI or with SpeI and EcoRI, respectively, and introduced into BamHI and EcoRI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to give pcDNA3-AMPKα2. Nucleotide sequences of the PCR products were determined to verify the absence of random mutations. RNA Interference–To knock down the endogenous AMPKα, U2OS cells were transiently transfected with 10 nm of the chemically synthesized siRNAs targeting AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 or with the nonsilencing control siRNA (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Total RNA and whole cell lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection. siRNA sequences used in the present study are available upon request. Glucose Depletion Induces Apoptotic Cell Death in Vivo and in Vitro–To examine whether glucose depletion could induce apoptotic cell death in vivo, we have prepared thymocytes from wild-type and p53-deficient mice that were maintained in the absence of glucose for 24 h, and their cell cycle distributions were analyzed by FACS. As shown in Fig. 1A, glucose deprivation resulted in a significant increase in number of thymocytes with sub-G1 DNA content in wild-type mice, whereas glucose depletion had undetectable effects on thymocytes derived from p53-deficient mice, indicating that glucose deprivation-mediated apoptotic cell death might be regulated in a p53-dependent manner. Consistent with the previous observations (22Jones R.G. Plas D.R. Kubek S. Buzzai M. Mu J. Xu Y. Birnbaum M.J. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 283-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar), glucose depletion promoted the extensive phosphorylation of AMPKα in wild-type thymocytes (Fig. 1B). Under our experimental conditions, p53 accumulated in response to glucose starvation. Intriguingly, the accumulation of p53 was clearly associated with a significant induction of AMPKα phosphorylation as well as pro-apoptotic Bax, which is one of the direct targets of p53 (19Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 20Sionov R.V. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6145-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 21Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). Additionally, proteolytic cleavage of PARP, which is one of the substrates of the activated caspase-3, was induced in response to glucose deprivation. In contrast, the expression levels of p21WAF1, which have been shown to be implicated in p53-dependent cell cycle arrest (19Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 20Sionov R.V. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6145-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 21Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar), remained almost unchanged regardless of glucose deprivation. To further confirm this issue in vitro, human osteosarcoma-derived U2OS cells bearing wild-type p53 were cultured in medium completely deficient in glucose for the indicated times, and we examined their cell cycle distributions by FACS. As shown in Fig. 2A, glucose depletion led to a massive apoptotic cell death. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression levels of AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 remain unchanged (Fig. 2B). Unexpectedly, p53 was transcriptionally induced upon removal of glucose, which was associated with the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic Bax and p53 AIP1 (25Oda K. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Matsuda K. Tanikawa C. Mori T. Nishimori H. Tamai K. Tokino T. Nakamura Y. Taya Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 849-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 26Matsuda K. Yoshida K. Taya Y. Nakamura K. Nakamura Y. Arakawa H. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2883-2889PubMed Google Scholar), although the expression levels of p21WAF1 remained almost constant during the glucose deprivation-mediated apoptotic cell death. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that AMPKα is induced to be phosphorylated following glucose starvation (Fig. 2C). In contrast, total amounts of AMPKα remained unchanged even in the absence of glucose. Additionally, glucose deprivation led to an accumulation of p53 as well as an induction of p53 phosphorylation at Ser-46 but not at Ser-15 and Ser-20. As expected, the expression levels of pro-apoptotic Bax but not of p21WAF1 increased, and proteolytic cleavage of PARP was detectable in response to glucose deprivation. Effects of p53 Knockdown on Glucose Deprivation-mediated Apoptotic Cell Death–To ask whether p53 could be involved in apoptotic cell death in response to glucose removal, U2OS cells were transiently transfected with control siRNA or with siRNA against p53. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were switched into fresh medium lacking glucose. At the indicated time points after glucose starvation, whole cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for the expression levels of p53 by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3A, p53 was induced to accumulate in cells transfected with control siRNA, whereas the amounts of p53 were kept at extremely low levels in cells transfected with siRNA against p53. FACS analysis revealed that siRNA-mediated knockdown of p53 strongly reduces the number of cells with sub-G1 DNA content in response to glucose deprivation as compared with that of control cells (Fig. 3B). Similarly, p53-deficient human osteosarcoma-derived SAOS-2 cells underwent apoptotic cell death in response to glucose deprivation to a lesser degree, suggesting that p53 contributes at least in part to the induction of apoptotic cell death following glucose depletion. Because glucose deprivation resulted in the strong induction of AMPKα phosphorylation, we examined the effects of AMPKα on glucose deprivation-mediated apoptotic cell death. To this end, siRNA-mediated knockdown of AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 was performed. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were maintained in the absence of glucose. At the indicated time points after glucose starvation, cells were harvested, and their cell cycle distributions were analyzed by FACS. As shown in Fig. 4A, siRNA-mediated knockdown remarkably inhibited apoptotic cell death caused by glucose removal relative to control cells. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that simultaneous knockdown of AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 does not induce the phosphorylation of AMPKα as well as the accumulation of p53 in response to glucose deprivation (Fig. 4B). Intriguingly, induction of p53 phosphorylation at Ser-46 was not detectable in cells where AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 were knocked down. Additionally, RT-PCR analysis showed that knockdown of AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 significantly inhibits the transcriptional up-regulation of p53 as well as p53 AIP1 (Fig. 4C). Under our experimental condit"

It was previously shown that in macrophages, MIF binds to a complex of CD74 and CD44, resulting in initiation of a signaling pathway. In the current study, we investigated the role of MIF in B cell survival. We show that in B lymphocytes, MIF initiates a signaling cascade that involves Syk and Akt, leading to NF-κB activation, proliferation, and survival in a CD74- and CD44-dependent manner. Thus, MIF regulates the adaptive immune response by maintaining the mature B cell population.

Thus, MIF regulates the adaptive immune response by maintaining the mature B cell population. An established paradigm divides the immunologic response into innate and adaptive components, with critical interactions between the two producing normal immunity or immunopathology. The innate response represents the earliest host response to invasive pathogens by cells such as monocytes/macrophages, whereas the adaptive response includes the development of antigen-specific responses, antibody production, and immunologic memory. Significant attention is currently focused on the molecules that link innate and adaptive immunity, and that may critically regulate immune responses or the development of inflammatory/autoimmune diseases. CD74 is a non-polymorphic type II integral membrane protein that is expressed on antigen presenting cells including macrophages and B cells. It has a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of 28 amino acids, followed by a single 24-amino acid transmembrane region and an ∼150-amino acid lumenal domain. The CD74 chain was considered initially to function mainly as a major histocompatibility complex class II chaperone, which promotes endoplasmic reticulum exit of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, directs them to endocytic compartments, prevents peptide binding in the endoplasmic reticulum, and contributes to peptide editing in the major histocompatibility complex class II compartment (1Stumptner-Cuvelette P. Benaroch P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1542: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A small proportion of CD74 is modified by the addition of chondroitin sulfate (CD74-CS), and this form of CD74 is expressed on the surface of antigen presenting cells, including monocytes and B cells. Antibody blocking studies additionally have shown that CD74-CS interacts with CD44, which activates a Src-kinase dependent signaling pathway (2Naujokas M.F. Morin M. Anderson M.S. Peterson M. Miller J. Cell. 1993; 74: 257-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It was previously shown that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) 3The abbreviations used are: MIFmacrophage migration inhibitory factorFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterFCSfetal calf serumPIpropidium iodideRTreversetranscriptaseTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]glycineHPRThypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase. 3The abbreviations used are: MIFmacrophage migration inhibitory factorFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterFCSfetal calf serumPIpropidium iodideRTreversetranscriptaseTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]glycineHPRThypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase. binds to the CD74 extracellular domain on macrophages, a process that results in initiation of a signaling pathway (3Leng L.

MIF accounts for one of the first cytokine activities to have been described (4George M. Vaughn J.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1962; 111: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). MIF promotes monocyte/macrophage activation and is required for the optimal expression of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and prostaglandin E2 (5Calandra T. Bernhagen J. Mitchell R.A. Bucala R.

The role of MIF in adaptive immunity is less well characterized, but neutralization of MIF using specific antibodies inhibits delayed-type hypersensitivity, T cell priming, and antibody production in vivo (12Bernhagen J.

CD44 is a broadly expressed single-pass transmembrane protein with known kinase-activating properties. Recently, CD44 was described as an integral component of the CD74 receptor complex (16Meyer-Siegler K.L. Leifheit E.C. Vera P.L. BMC Cancer. 2004; 4: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Shi X. Leng L. Wang T. Wang W. Du X. Li J. McDonald C. Chen Z. Murphy J.W. Lolis E. Noble P. Knudson W. Bucala R. Immunity. 2006; 25: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Whereas CD74 was sufficient for MIF cell surface binding, CD44 was found to be necessary for MIF signal transduction (17Shi X. Leng L. Wang T. Wang W. Du X. Li J. McDonald C. Chen Z. Murphy J.W. Lolis E. Noble P. Knudson W. Bucala R. Immunity. 2006; 25: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we showed that CD74 expressed on B cells is directly involved in the survival of the mature B cell population (18Shachar I. Flavell R.A. Science. 1996; 274: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Matza D. Lantner D. Bogoch Y. Flaishon L. Hershkoviz R. Shachar I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 246-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (61) Google Scholar) through a pathway leading to the activation of transcription mediated by the NF-κB p65/RelA homodimer and its co-activator, TAFII105 (21Matza D. Wolstein O. Dikstein R. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27203-27206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). NF-κB activation is mediated by the cytosolic region of CD74 (CD74-ICD), which is liberated from the membrane (22Matza D. Kerem A. Lantner F. Shachar I. Immunity. 2002; 17: 549-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that following the removal of the CD74 lumenal domain, an intramembranal cleavage event at amino acid 42 occurs, resulting in the release of the CD74 cytosolic fragment (CD74-ICD; amino acids 1–42). CD74-ICD then translocates to the cell nucleus and activates NF-κB (23Becker-Herman S. Arie G. Medvedovsky H. Kerem A. Shachar I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5061-5069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, CD74 acts as a signaling molecule and requires a processing step to mediate a signal resulting in accumulation of mature B cells. This signal is attenuated by degradation of the active CD74-ICD fragment, and its removal from the cytoplasm (20Matza D. Kerem A. Shachar I. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 246-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Matza D. Kerem A. Lantner F. Shachar I. Immunity. 2002; 17: 549-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, we recently demonstrated that CD74 stimulation with anti-CD74 antibody leads to NF-κB activation, enabling entry of the stimulated B cells into the S phase, an increase in DNA synthesis, cell division, and augmented expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. These findings therefore indicate that surface CD74 functions as a survival receptor (24Starlets D. Gore Y. Binsky I. Haran M. Harpaz N. Shvidel L. Becker-Herman S. Berrebi A. Shachar I. Blood. 2006; 107: 4807-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, the natural ligand of CD74 on B cells was not known. In this study we followed the role of MIF in B cells. We show that CD74 forms a complex with CD44 on the B cell surface, and that MIF can serve as a ligand for the CD74-CD44 complex; this complex is essential for the MIF-induced signaling cascade that results in B cell survival. Cells—Spleen cells were obtained from C57BL/6, CD44-/- (25Teder P. Vandivier R.W. Jiang D. Liang J. Cohn L. Pure E. Henson P.M. Noble P.W. Science. 2002; 296: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), or CD74-/- (26Elliott E.A. Drake J.R. Amigorena S. Elsemore J. Webster P. Mellman I. Flavell R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 681-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) mice. All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Research Committee at the Weizmann Institute. Cells and B Cell Separation—Spleen cells were obtained from the various mice at 6–8 weeks of age, as previously described (27Shachar I. Elliot E.A. Chasnoff B. Grewal I.S. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 1995; 3: 373-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). B cells were then purified from each mouse strain, using CD45R beads (BD Biosciences). The purity of the purified cells (between 96 and 99%) was analyzed by FACS following each experiment. MIF Stimulation—Recombinant murine MIF was purified from an expression system as previously described and contaminating endotoxin removed by C8 chromatography (28Bernhagen J. Mitchell R.A. Calandra T. Voelter W. Cerami A. Bucala R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14144-14155Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). For MIF stimulation, 1 × 107 primary B cells were incubated in RPMI medium containing 0.1% (v/v) FCS at 37 °C for 3 h. Next, cells were resuspended in medium containing 100 ng/ml of recombinant MIF and incubated at 37 °C for various periods. Propidium Iodide (PI) Staining—Purified B cells were cultured in 6-well plates at 1 × 107 cells/well in RPMI medium supplemented with 3% FCS, 2 mm glutamate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, with or without MIF (100 ng/ml) and 0.1 μm of the MIF inhibitor ISO-1 (Calbiochem) for 24 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, and fixed in 70% cold ethanol and incubated in the presence of RNase (25 μg/ml). PI (25 μg/ml) (Sigma) was added and analyzed by FACS. Luciferase Assay for Monitoring NF-κB Activation—Subconfluent 293 cells were transfected in a 24-well plate using a total of 1 mg of plasmid; empty or CD74 expression vectors (400 ng) were added together with 20 ng of the Gal4 luciferase reporter, 0.5 ng of DNA binding domain fusion plasmids, and 1 ng of Rous sarcoma virus-Renilla luciferase. The total amount of DNA was kept constant by adding pBabe vector. Cells were incubated for 5 h and then stimulated with MIF (100 ng/ml) and 0.1 μm ISO-1 for 24 h, harvested, and luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were measured. Proliferation of B Cells—Purified B cells were cultured in 96-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well in RPMI medium supplemented with 1% FCS, 2 mm glutamate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, in the presence of 100 ng/ml MIF, 0.1 μm ISO-1, or 25 μg/ml LPS from Salmonella typhosa (Sigma) for 24 h. DNA synthesis was assayed by pulsing the cultures with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine for the last 18 h of culture, after which the cells were harvested and counted. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the TriReagent kit (MRC). Reverse transcription was carried out using Superscript II RT (Invitrogen). Primers that were used included: Cyclin E, 5′-GAAAATCAGACCACCCAGAGCC and 3′-GAAATGATACAAAGCAGAAGCAGCG; BCL-2, 5′-CAGGGCGATGTTGTCC and 3′-CTGGCATCTTCTCCTTCC; HPRT, 5′-GAGGGTAGGCTGGCCTATGGCT and 3′-GTTGGATACAGGCCAGACTTTGTTG. Preparation of Cell Extracts—Stimulated cells were lysed in buffer containing: 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm vanadate, 75 mm β-glycophosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaPPi, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in the presence of the following protease inhibitors: 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml chymostatin (Roche), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and 20 mm N-ethylmalemide (Sigma). Cell Lysis by Hot SDS—Cell lysates were prepared as described previously (29Erickson A.H. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11771-11774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tricine Gels—16% (w/v) Tricine SDS-PAGE were performed as previously described (30Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—To detect changes in protein phosphorylation, lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated by 12% (w/v) SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-Tyr(P) (pTyr99; Santa Cruz) followed by horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-mouse (The Jackson Laboratory). The membrane was then stripped and reprobed with anti-tubulin antibody (Sigma) followed by peroxidase-conjugated antimouse (Jackson Laboratory). To detect changes in Akt phosphorylation, the membrane was probed with anti-p-Akt antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (Jackson Laboratory). The membrane then was stripped and reprobed with anti-tubulin antibody (Santa Cruz) followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (Jackson Laboratory). To detect CD74 intramembrane cleavage, lysates were resolved by Tricine gels, blotted into nitrocellulose, and probed as described previously (22Matza D. Kerem A. Lantner F. Shachar I. Immunity. 2002; 17: 549-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were conjugated to Tyr(P) monoclonal antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by three washes in phosphate-buffered saline. Beads were added to the cell lysates and Tyr(P) proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight. The protein G-bound material was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% SDS and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Immunoprecipitates were separated by 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE. The protein bands were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-Syk (4D11, Pharmingen) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratories). Annexin PI Staining—Purified B cells were cultured in 24-well plates at 1 × 107 cells/well in Opti-MEM medium supplemented with 3% FCS, 2 mm glutamate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, with or without 100 ng/ml MIF, and 0.1 μm ISO-1 for 18 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, and stained with Annexin (BD Biosciences) and PI (Bender Medsystems) for 15 min at room temperature. Annexin and PI staining were analyzed by FACS. Hyaluronic Acid Stimulation—Primary B cells (1 × 107) were incubated in RPMI medium containing 0.1% (v/v) FCS at 37 °C for 3 h. Next, cells were cultured in 24-well plates at 1 × 107 cells/well in RPMI medium supplemented with 0.1% FCS, and incubated in the presence or absence of 0.1 mg/ml hyaluronic acid (Sigma), 6 μg/ml anti-CD44 antibody (KM114; BD Biosciences), and 6 μg/ml anti-isotype control antibody for 8 h at 37 °C. CD44 Blocking—B cells (1 × 107) were incubated with 100 ng/ml MIF. For CD44 blocking, 1 × 107 B cells were incubated in 1 ml of RPMI medium containing 0.1% (v/v) FCS in the presence of 6 μg/ml anti-murine CD44 (KM114; BD Biosciences) at 37 °C for 8 h. Immunofluorescence and Flow Cytometry—Staining was performed on freshly isolated splenocytes. The following antibodies were used: RA3–6B2 anti-CD45R/B220 and anti-CD44 (ebioscience). Staining was analyzed by FACS. Characterization of B Cells—Freshly isolated splenocytes were stained for RA3-6B2 anti-CD45R/B220, anti-CD21 (CR2/CR; eBioscience), anti-CD24(HSA) (eBioscience), and anti-CD23 (eBioscience) and analyzed by FACS. MIF Injections—C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected daily with 200 ng of MIF for 8 days. Spleens were collected and splenocytes were analyzed for their B cell repertoire and survival. A Complex of CD74 and CD44 Is Essential to Initiate a Signaling Cascade Induced by MIF—It was recently shown that CD44 is an integral member of the CD74 receptor complex leading to MIF signal transduction in monocytes (17Shi X. Leng L. Wang T. Wang W. Du X. Li J. McDonald C. Chen Z. Murphy J.W. Lolis E. Noble P. Knudson W. Bucala R.

To determine whether in B cells, CD74 forms a similar complex with CD44, we first analyzed its cell surface expression in B cells by FACS analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, B cells derived from control or CD74-deficient mice express cell surface CD44. To analyze CD74-CD44 complexes, control B splenocytes were lysed and CD44 was immunoprecipitated. Immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by anti-CD74. As shown in Fig. 1, B–D, CD44 specifically pulled down CD74, mainly of the p31 isoform, showing that CD74 forms a complex with CD44 in B cells. CD44 mRNA levels were unchanged following MIF stimulation in both control and CD74-/- B cells (data not shown). In addition, the existence of the CD74-CD44 complex was MIF independent, because no change in its formation was detected in cells treated with MIF for short (Fig. 1E) or longer (data not shown) periods. We then wished to determine whether MIF binds to this complex, inducing a signaling cascade. We demonstrated previously that in mouse B cells, CD74 releases its cytosolic domain (CD74-ICD) and initiates a signaling pathway that activates NF-κB and promotes cell survival (24Starlets D. Gore Y. Binsky I. Haran M. Harpaz N. Shvidel L. Becker-Herman S. Berrebi A. Shachar I. Blood. 2006; 107: 4807-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To determine whether MIF stimulation triggers CD74-ICD release in a CD44-dependent manner, we first followed the intramembrane cleavage in control and CD44-/- B cells. Cells were lysed with hot SDS, and the release of CD74-ICD was analyzed by Tricine gel. As seen in Fig. 2A, MIF stimulation elevated the degree of intramembrane cleavage and liberation of the CD74 cytosolic domain. However, the specific augmentation of CD74-ICD release was abolished in CD44-deficient cells. We then followed the MIF-induced signaling cascade. The cells then were lysed and phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis. We have previously shown that Syk and Akt phosphorylation is induced following anti-CD74 stimulation. To determine whether these proteins are phosphorylated following MIF stimulation, B cells derived from control, CD74-/-, or CD44-/- mice were incubated in the presence or absence of MIF for 0–10 min. Next, the cells were lysed and Syk and Akt phosphorylation were analyzed. As can be seen in Fig. 2, whereas MIF induces Syk (Fig. 2B) and Akt (Fig. 2E) phosphorylation in the control B cells, it did not affect the activation of these proteins in CD74-/- (Fig. 2, C and F) or CD44-/- (Fig. 2, D and G) B cells. Thus, MIF initiates a signaling cascade involving Syk tyrosine kinase and Akt proteins through interaction and activation of cell surface CD74 and CD44. We previously demonstrated that CD74 induces a signaling pathway that results in NF-κB activation and cell survival (21Matza D. Wolstein O. Dikstein R. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27203-27206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 24Starlets D. Gore Y. Binsky I. Haran M. Harpaz N. Shvidel L. Becker-Herman S. Berrebi A. Shachar I. Blood. 2006; 107: 4807-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To determine whether MIF induces a similar cascade activating NF-κB in the nucleus, a fusion construct containing the C-terminal transactivation domain of p65/RelA and the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 was co-transfected into HEK 293 cells, along with a luciferase reporter containing the Gal4 binding sites, with CD74, and with the Rous sarcoma virus promoter, which was used as a reference (21Matza D. Wolstein O. Dikstein R. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27203-27206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 24Starlets D. Gore Y. Binsky I. Haran M. Harpaz N. Shvidel L. Becker-Herman S. Berrebi A. Shachar I. Blood. 2006; 107: 4807-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The cells then were incubated in the presence or absence of MIF and luciferase activity was measured 24 h later. As demonstrated in Fig. 3A, stimulation with MIF significantly increased NF-κB activity. To further verify the role of MIF in NF-κB activation, cells were treated with the MIF antagonist ISO-1. ISO-1 (a cell-permeable isoxazoline compound), a non-toxic inhibitor of MIF that binds to bioactive MIF at a catalytically active tautomerase site (31Dios A. Mitchell R.A. Aljabari B. Lubetsky J. O'Connor K. Liao H. Senter P.D. Manogue K.R. Lolis E. Metz C. Bucala R. Callaway D.J. Al-Abed Y. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 2410-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, ISO-1 reduced MIF-induced NF-κB activation to baseline levels. These data support a model whereby MIF activation of CD74 initiates a signaling cascade leading to NF-κB activation in B cells. MIF Induces Proliferation and Survival in B Cells—In most cases examined, Akt activation promotes various cellular responses that are associated with cell division, including increased cell size, suppression of apoptosis, inactivation of cell cycle inhibitors, and induction of cyclin and cytokine gene expression (32Fruman D.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently demonstrated that an activating anti-CD74 antibody induces B cell proliferation and survival (24Starlets D. Gore Y. Binsky I. Haran M. Harpaz N. Shvidel L. Becker-Herman S. Berrebi A. Shachar I. Blood. 2006; 107: 4807-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To determine whether CD74 stimulation by MIF triggers B cell proliferation and survival, [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured in MIF-stimulated and unstimulated cells in B cells derived from control, CD74-/-, or CD44-/- mice. A specific elevation in [3H]thymidine incorporation was observed 24 h (Fig. 3B) following MIF stimulation, whereas B cells deficient in CD74 or CD44 did not respond (although they were able to respond to LPS stimulation). Propidium iodide staining showed that the proportion of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle was elevated upon MIF stimulation of control, but not CD74-/- or CD44-/- B cells. Cell cycle progression is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases. Cyclin-dependent kinases are constitutively expressed during the cell cycle and are activated upon binding to specific cyclins differentially expressed during various stages of the cell cycle. This transient cyclin expression activates cyclin-dependent kinases and regulates cell cycle progression (33Nebreda A.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To further determine whether MIF regulates cell entry into the S-phase in a CD74- or CD44-dependent fashion, we followed cyclin E, which is expressed upon S-phase initiation. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, B–D, cyclin E RNA levels were up-regulated following MIF stimulation. Stimulation of cyclin E was specific and did not occur in CD74- or CD44-deficient B cells. Altogether, these results demonstrate that following MIF stimulation, B cells synthesize DNA, enter S phase, and divide. To determine whether MIF induces a survival cascade in B cells, the transcription of the anti-apoptotic and survival factors was followed. B splenocytes isolated from control, CD74-/-, or CD44-/- mice were incubated in the presence or absence of MIF (100 ng/ml) for 8 h and Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 expression followed by RT-PCR. Whereas MIF stimulation of control B cells resulted in augmentation of Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 transcription, no change was detected in CD74-/-- or CD44-/--stimulated B cells (Fig. 5, A–D). To further verify the role of MIF in B cell survival, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of MIF and its antagonist, ISO-1. As shown in Fig. 5D, treatment of control B cells with ISO-1 resulted in a significant reduction of MIF-induced Bcl-2 mRNA levels, showing that MIF regulates Bcl-2 expression. The requirement for the CD44 signaling co-receptor in MIF-mediated survival signals was tested by stimulating B cells in the presence or absence of anti-CD44, which blocks hyaluronan binding, without inducing shedding or internalization of CD44 (supplementary data Fig. 1). Bcl-2 transcription was then followed using RT-PCR. As can be seen in Fig. 5E, the MIF-induced Bcl-2 transcription was dramatically inhibited by the anti-CD44 antibodies in control B cells, whereas no change was observed in CD74-/- cells. Furthermore, activation with hyaluronic acid in control B cells elevated Bcl-2 mRNA levels in a CD44-dependent manner, whereas in cells lacking CD74, this cascade was inhibited (Fig. 5G). Thus, both receptors are essential for the B cell survival cascade. To directly demonstrate the role of MIF-induced cascade in B cell survival, we then followed the effect of MIF and ISO-1 on B cell survival. B cells were incubated in the presence or absence of MIF or ISO-1 and the cells were then analyzed for apoptosis by PI-Annexin staining. As shown in Fig. 6, a reduction in Annexin positive cells and elevation of the live population was detected in control cells stimulated with MIF, whereas in cells deficient of CD74 or CD44, no change was observed. In addition, treatment with ISO-1 significantly restored the Annexin-positive population, supporting the role of MIF in promoting B cell survival. Finally, to directly demonstrate the in vivo role of MIF-induced cascade in B cell survival, control, CD74-/-, or CD44-/- splenocytes were analyzed for their apoptotic population by Annexin staining. As shown in Fig. 7A, splenic B cells lacking MIF or its receptors (CD74 and CD44) showed reduced viability and a larger population of apoptotic cells compared with the wild-type B population. To determine whether the CD74-CD44 regulates mature B cell survival, we compared the B cell populations in control, CD74-/-, and CD44-/- mice. As demonstrated in Fig. 7B, mice lacking CD44 showed a reduction in their mature B cell population; however, this down-regulation was not as dramatic as in mice deficient for CD74 (Fig. 7B) (18Shachar I. Flavell R.A. Science. 1996; 274: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To directly follow the role of MIF in regulating the B cell survival and repertoire, control mice were injected with phosphate-buffered saline or MIF for 8 days and their B cell subpopulations and survival were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 7C, MIF stimulation reduced the apoptosis of the B cell population, resulting in a reduced transitional population and an elevation in the percent of mature cells. These results show that MIF induces a survival cascade that is CD74-CD44 dependent, and that enlarges the mature B cell compartment. MIF accounts for one of the first cytokine activities to have been described (4George M. Vaughn J.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1962; 111: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). An important feature of the biologic action of MIF is its ability to sustain monocyte/macrophage activation in the face of activation-induced, p53-dependent apoptosis (7Mitchell R.A. Liao H. Chesney J. Fingerle-Rowson G. Baugh J. David J. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 34Hudson J.D. Shoaibi M.A. Maestro R. Carnero A. Hannon G.J. Beach D.H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1375-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Endotoxemic, MIF-deficient mice exhibit increased macrophage apoptosis than wild-type controls, and this enhanced apoptosis is recapitulated in mice lacking the MIF binding (CD74) or signaling (CD44) receptors (17Shi X. Leng L. Wang T. Wang W. Du X. Li J. McDonald C. Chen Z. Murphy J.W. Lolis E. Noble P. Knudson W. Bucala R. Immunity. 2006; 25: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). MIF was recently described to be a cognate ligand for CD74 (3Leng L. Metz C.N. Fang Y. Xu J. Donnelly S. Baugh J. Delohery T. Chen Y. Mitchell R.A. Bucala R. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). The results presented here demonstrate that in B lymphocytes, MIF initiates a signaling cascade, leading to B cell survival in a CD74- and CD44-dependent manner. Thus, MIF regulates survival of both innate and adaptive immune cells and therefore might serve as a link between these responses. Our studies show that in B cells, MIF initiates a signaling cascade following binding to the CD74-CD44 complex. Immunoprecipitation studies also support the formation of a complex between CD74 and CD44 in B cells. This ensuing signaling cascade involves the Syk and Akt kinases. Syk belongs to the Syk/ZAP-70 family of protein-tyrosine kinase and plays a crucial role in B cell development, both during B-cell fate decisions and during antigen processing. Recent findings indicate that expression of Syk in non-hematopoietic cells plays a role in a wide variety of cellular functions and in the pathogenesis of malignant tumors (35Takano T. Sada K. Yamamura H. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Syk was previously shown to be required for the activation of Akt in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner. Indeed, following MIF stimulation, we detected activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase effector, Akt (36Cantrell D. Semin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 37Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5049) Google Scholar). Akt activation promotes a number of cellular responses that are associated with cell division, including increased cell size, suppression of apoptosis, inactivation of cell cycle inhibitors, and induction of cyclin and cytokine gene expression (32Fruman D.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, expression of activated Akt in T cells correlates with augmented NF-κB function, including the up-regulation of Bcl-XL (38Jones R.G. Parsons M. Bonnard M. Chan V.S. Yeh W.C. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1721-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 39Kane L.P. Andres P.G. Howland K.C. Abbas A.K. Weiss A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Our results also demonstrated that MIF augmented NF-κB function, which was associated with entry into the S phase, elevation of DNA synthesis resulting in cell division, and increased expression of Bcl-XL and Bcl-2, leading to a suppression of apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results establish that MIF binding to both CD74 and CD44 initiates a survival pathway, resulting in the rescue of the mature B population from death. Interestingly, both MIF and CD74 have been implicated in pathways important for tumor progression. It has been reported that MIF is overexpressed in solid tumors (40Meyer-Siegler K. Hudson P.B. Urology. 1996; 48: 448-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 41Bando H. Matsumoto G. Bando M. Muta M. Ogawa T. Funata N. Nishihira J. Koike M. Toi M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 2002; 93: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and that expression is associated with the growth of malignant cells (42Nishihira J. Ishibashi T. Fukushima T. Sun B. Sato Y. Todo S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 995: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Anti-MIF immunoglobulin therapy has also been shown to induce an anti-tumor response (43Chesney J. Metz C. Bacher M. Peng T. Meinhardt A. Bucala R. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 181-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many studies have demonstrated the overexpression of CD74 in various cancers (16Meyer-Siegler K.L. Leifheit E.C. Vera P.L.

Cancer. 1997; 79: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and CD74 has been suggested to serve as a prognostic factor, with higher relative expression of CD74 behaving as a marker of tumor progression (49Mizue Y. Nishihira J. Miyazaki T. Fujiwara S. Chida M. Nakamura K. Kikuchi K. Mukai M. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 5: 397-403PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a humanized anti-CD74 monoclonal antibody (hLL1) was shown to have a therapeutic action in multiple myeloma, perhaps due to the high level of expression of CD74 in this plasma cell malignancy (50Stein R. Qu Z. Cardillo T.M. Chen S. Rosario A. Horak I.D. Hansen H.J. Goldenberg D.M. Blood. 2004; 104: 3705-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). CD44 describes a type I transmembrane family of signaling proteins that are encoded by a single, highly conserved gene (51Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Jackson D.G. Cornelis F.B. Gerth U. Bell J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12160-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). There is heterogeneity in the structure of the mature protein product that is due in part to post-translational modifications that differ depending on the cell type and growth conditions. In addition, CD44 transcripts are subject to alternative splicing, which predominantly affects the extracellular, membrane-proximal stem structure of the protein (52Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. Amiot M. Seed B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 53Gunthert U. Hofmann M. Rudy W. Reber S. Zoller M. Haussmann I. Matzku S. Wenzel A. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1991; 65: 13-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). Studies in which the function of the protein was disrupted indicate roles for CD44 in tumor formation, immune responsiveness, and hematopoiesis, as well as in immunity against bacterial infection. The signaling properties of CD44 result for the assembly of intracellular complexes that may vary with the nature of the stimulus and the ectodomain structure of the protein (54Morrison H. Sherman L.S. Legg J. Banine F. Isacke C. Haipek C.A. Gutmann D.H. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 968-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). CD44-mediated signals involve non-receptor tyrosine kinases and other intracellular mediators that lead to enhanced cell growth, motility, and survival. Here, we show that the hyaluronic acid binding domain plays a role in MIF binding. The studies described herein thus establish the functional role of an MIF-activated, CD74-CD44 complex in delivering signals important for B cell survival.

https://openalex.org/W1979689648,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem complex autoimmune disease of uncertain etiology (OMIM 152700). Over recent years a genetic component to SLE susceptibility has been established. Recent successes with association studies in SLE have identified genes including IRF5 (refs. 4,5) and FCGR3B. Two tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily members located within intervals showing genetic linkage with SLE are TNFSF4 (also known as OX40L; 1q25), which is expressed on activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and vascular endothelial cells, and also its unique receptor, TNFRSF4 (also known as OX40; 1p36), which is primarily expressed on activated CD4+ T cells. TNFSF4 produces a potent co-stimulatory signal for activated CD4+ T cells after engagement of TNFRSF4 (ref. 11). Using both a family-based and a case-control study design, we show that the upstream region of TNFSF4 contains a single risk haplotype for SLE, which is correlated with increased expression of both cell-surface TNFSF4 and the TNFSF4 transcript. We hypothesize that increased expression of TNFSF4 predisposes to SLE either by quantitatively augmenting T cell-APC interaction or by influencing the functional consequences of T cell activation via TNFRSF4."
https://openalex.org/W1998524371,"Halogen atom incorporation into a scaffold of bioactive compounds often amplifies biological activity, as is the case for the anticancer agent salinosporamide A (1), a chlorinated natural product from the marine bacterium Salinispora tropica. Significant effort in understanding enzymatic chlorination shows that oxidative routes predominate to form reactive electrophilic or radical chlorine species. Here we report the genetic, biochemical and structural characterization of the chlorinase SalL, which halogenates S-adenosyl-L-methionine (2) with chloride to generate 5'-chloro-5'-deoxyadenosine (3) and L-methionine (4) in a rarely observed nucleophilic substitution strategy analogous to that of Streptomyces cattleya fluorinase. Further metabolic tailoring produces a halogenated polyketide synthase substrate specific for salinosporamide A biosynthesis. SalL also accepts bromide and iodide as substrates, but not fluoride. High-resolution crystal structures of SalL and active site mutants complexed with substrates and products support the S(N)2 nucleophilic substitution mechanism and further illuminate halide specificity in this newly discovered halogenase family."

Because no bone formation occurs in Osterix null mice, Osterix is thought to be an essential regulator of osteoblast differentiation.

Second, Dlx5 binds to the BMP-responsive homeodomain sequences both in vitro and in vivo. Third, Dlx5 overexpression and knock-down assays demonstrate its role in activating Osterix expression in response to BMP-2. Furthermore, we show that Dlx5 is a novel substrate for p38 MAPK in vitro and in vivo and that Ser-34 and Ser-217 are the sites phosphorylated by p38.

Bone is a dynamic tissue that is constantly remodeled throughout life. Bone remodeling activity is dependent on a strict coupling mechanism of osteoclast resorption and new matrix deposition by osteoblasts, and an imbalance between these two activities leads to pathological states such as osteoporosis and osteosclerosis. Commitment to the osteoblast phenotype is ultimately controlled by a specific set of transcription factors activated by signals and regulatory pathways. Among them, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 5The abbreviations used are: BMPbone morphogenetic proteinOsxOsterixRT-qPCR; reverse phase quantitative PCR; GAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinase. signaling has been shown to be involved in bone regeneration and osteoblast differentiation in vitro and in vivo (1Chen D.

In addition, NFATc1 forms a complex with Osx and activates Osx-dependent collagen 1 promoter activity, whereas it does not activate Runx2-dependent transcription (11Koga T. Matsui Y. Asagiri M.

Different homeodomain-containing transcription factors have been implicated in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. For instance, two isoforms of Prx1, called Prx1A and -B, are critical for cartilage, bone, and tooth development (12Mitchell J.M. Hicklin D.M. Doughty P.M. Hicklin J.H. Dickert Jr., J.W. Tolbert S.M.

Dlx3, -5, and -6 are transcription factors that belong to the distal-less, homeodomain-containing family of transcription factors. Their genes are arranged in tightly linked bigene pairs in the genome and are co-expressed in developing bones (16Depew M.J. Simpson C.A. Morasso M. Rubenstein J.L. J. Anat. 2005; 207: 501-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Dlx5-null mice have craniofacial abnormalities with a delayed cranial ossification and abnormal osteogenesis (17Acampora D. Merlo G.R. Paleari L. Zerega B. Postiglione M.P. Mantero S. Bober E. Barbieri O. Simeone A. Levi G. Development. 1999; 126: 3795-3809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Depew M.J. Liu J.K. Long J.E.

Inactivation of both Dlx5 and Dlx6 results in skeletal defects that are considerably more severe, suggesting that they have redundant functions and are involved in endochondral ossification as well (19Robledo R.F.

These homeodomain transcription factors exhibit distinct temporal expression profiles during osteoblast differentiation, with Dlx3 expressed in osteoprogenitors and Dlx5 expressed in more mature osteoblasts. Runx2 and Osx transcription is stimulated by BMP treatment in vitro (8Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B.

Pretreatment with cycloheximide blocks these inductions, suggesting that either Runx2 or Osx are not direct targets of the BMP signaling cascade but require the expression of newly synthesized intermediates (26Lee M.H.

Interestingly, although expression of Osx in vivo requires Runx2, BMP-2 is still able to stimulate alkaline phosphatase activity and Osx expression in Runx2 deficient cells, whereas they were completely abrogated by antisense against Dlx5 (27Lee M.H. Kwon T.G. Park H.S. Wozney J.M. Ryoo H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Although these data suggest that Dlx5 is involved in BMP-induced Osx expression, little is known about the mechanism for activation of Osx expression in response to BMP signaling. In this study, we identified a homeodomain regulatory sequence as the BMP-2-responsive region in the Osx promoter. The Dlx5 temporal expression pattern and binding to the responsive region as well as overexpression and knock-down of Dlx5 demonstrates its role in activating Osx expression in response to BMP-2. Furthermore, we show that Dlx5 is a novel substrate for p38 MAPK in vitro and in vivo and that Ser-34 and Ser-217 are the regulatory sites phosphorylated by p38. The transactivation potential of Dlx5 was increased by p38 phosphorylation, resulting in an increased expression of Osx. We propose a regulatory network where BMP activates expression of Osx through the induction of the immediate early gene Dlx5 and its further transcriptional activation by p38-mediated phosphorylation. Plasmids, Reagents, and Antibodies–The murine Osterix promoter from –1812 to +93 was obtained by PCR and cloned in the pGL2basic vector. Mutants were generated by cutting with SpeI, SmaI, SacI, or Kpn21, respectively. Annealed oligonucleotides encoding from either the –114 to –51 wild type sequence or the indicated mutations were cloned in the minimal promoter of c-fos promoter (28Lopez-Rovira T. Chalaux E. Massague J. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3176-3185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding Dlx5 was provided by Dr. Watanabe (National Institutes for Longevity Sciences, Japan) and subcloned into pGEX and pcDNA3.1His expression vectors. HisDlx5 was used as a parental plasmid to generate the phosphorylation mutants using PCR approaches. Dlx3, Prx1A, and Prx1B expression vectors were provided by Drs. M. Morasso (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and M. Kern (Medical University of South Carolina), respectively. Activated MKK6 expression vector and recombinant p38 were provided by Dra. P. Muñoz-Canoves (CRG, Barcelona, Spain). Expression vectors encoding p300 and histone acetyltransferase (ΔHAT) mutant were provided by Dr. M. Martinez-Balbas (CID, Barcelona, Spain). BMP-2 was a generous gift from Wyeth (Cambridge, MA). SB203580 (Calbiochem) was used at a final concentration of 10 μm. Antibodies against FLAG (M2 antibody F3165) (Sigma), His (αHis antibody 27–4710) (Amersham Biosciences), α-tubulin (Sigma), and phospho-p38 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) were used at 1:1000. Antibodies against Dlx5 C-20 (sc-18152) and Y-20 (sc-18151) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used at 1:500. Cell Culture and Transfection–C2C12 and HEK-293 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, pyruvate, and antibiotics. To induce differentiation, the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum and BMP-2 at a final concentration of 2 nm. C2C12 cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6. RT-qPCR Analysis–Total RNA was isolated from C2C12 cells using the Ultraspec RNA Isolation System (Biotecx, Houston, TX). 5 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using a Ready-to-Go First Strand kit (Amersham Biosciences) and oligo-dT as a primer. Quantitative PCRs were carried out using ABI Prism 7900 HT Fast Real-Time PCR System and a Taqman 5′-nuclease probe method (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All transcripts were normalized to GAPDH, and transfection efficiency was assessed by green fluorescent protein expression. Reporter Assays–C2C12 cells were transfected overnight. The next day cells were split before reaching confluence and treated with BMP-2 for 16–20 h. Luciferase activities were quantified using the luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase values were normalized using β-galactosidase activity measured with the luminescent β-galactosidase detection kit II (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays–100 ng of purified GST-Dlx5 fusion proteins and 1 μl of 32P-labeled probes were incubated in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 10% Sacarose, 5 mm MgCl2, 70 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of poly(dI/dC) for 20 min at room temperature. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturating polyacrylamide gel. Biotinylated Oligonucleotide Precipitation Assays–HEK-293 cells were transfected and 48 h later were lysed as described previously (28Lopez-Rovira T. Chalaux E. Massague J. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3176-3185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Biotinylated oligonucleotides encoding the –114 to –51 fragment of the Osterix promoter were incubated overnight with cell extracts in presence of 2 μg of poly(dI/dC) and collected with streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce). RNA-mediated Interference Assays–To knock down Dlx5 expression, two siRNA oligonucleotides against Dlx5 mRNA were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO): ON-TAR-GETplus J-041405-09 (J9) and J-041405-10 (J10). As a control, the non-targeting oligonucleotide ON-TARGETplus siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA D-001810-01 was transfected under the same conditions. C2C12 cells at 95% of confluence were transfected by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 16 h new medium with 15% fetal bovine serum was added to recover cells, and 8 h later cells were depleted overnight and then treated with or without BMP-2. Immunofluorescence Assay–24 h after transfection, C2C12 cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline. Cells were stained with mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma) at 1:400 dilution followed by goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa 488 at 1:2000. Labeling was detected using a Leica TCS SL inverted laser scanning confocal microscope. Metabolic Labeling–Labeling with [35S]methionine was performed as previously described (29Vinals F. Reiriz J. Ambrosio S. Bartrons R. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3527-3537Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) using HEK-293 cells expressing the indicated constructs followed by immunoprecipitation of labeled protein with anti-Dlx5 (Y-20 plus C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In Vitro Phosphorylation by p38 MAPK–1 μg of GST-p38 MAPK was activated by incubation with MBP-MKK6-DD (5:1 ratio) at 30 °C for 20 min in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 μm ATP. Activated p38 (50 ng) was incubated with 1 μg of recombinant Dlx5 in the same buffer supplemented with 1 μm ATP and 3 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 20 min. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation–C2C12 cells were transfected by FuGENE 6 with the indicated constructs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions but repeating all the washes twice. Antibodies used were anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-p300 (N-15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-acetylhistone H3, anti-RNA polymerase II, and control IgG (Upstate). Osterix Expression Is Stimulated by BMP-2 in C2C12 Cells–Previous studies had shown that Osx mRNA levels increase after BMP-2 addition in mesenchymal cell types, including primary osteoblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, and C2C12 cells (8Nakashima K.

To assess the temporal pattern of this response, we evaluated Osx mRNA levels in C2C12 cells at different time points after BMP-2 addition. Osx was not significantly expressed in undifferentiated C2C12 cells; however, upon BMP-2 addition, Osx mRNA levels were strongly increased (Fig. 1A). Osx expression was initially detected at 2 h and reached a maximum expression 8–16 h after BMP addition. This late induction of Osx mRNA suggests that Osx is an indirect target of BMP signaling, which is in agreement with previous data which had indicated that induction of Osx required new protein synthesis (27Lee M.H. Kwon T.G. Park H.S. Wozney J.M. Ryoo H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). A Homeobox Element Present in the Proximal Promoter Region Is the BMP-2-responsive Element–Previous work had shown that both the human and mouse Osx mRNA have two isoforms arising from two alternative promoters. These include a highly abundant form arising from the most proximal transcription start site and a minor form that is poorly transcribed (32Lu X. Gilbert L. He X. Rubin J. Nanes M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6297-6306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 33Milona M.A. Gough J.E. Edgar A.J. BMC Genomics. 2003; 4: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 34Nishio Y. Dong Y. Paris M. O'Keefe R.J. Schwarz E.M. Drissi H. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 372: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Our analysis indicates that BMP-2 activates the expression of the Osx mRNA form arising from this proximal transcription start site (Fig. 1A). This proximal TATA-less promoter contains a consensus Inr sequence at the transcription start site PyPyA(+1)NT/APyPy (35Smale S.T. Kadonaga J.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 449-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) and a cytosine-rich region between the –51 and –25 nucleotide. To define the BMP-2 responsive elements in the Osx promoter, we isolated this upstream regulatory sequence of the murine Osx gene. Using a reporter construct in C2C12 cells, we observed 3-fold activation with 2 nm BMP-2 (Fig. 1B). Then we used reporter assays to analyze serial deletions of the 1.9-kilobase promoter. The deletion of sequences from –1812 to –114 produced only slight decreases in BMP-2 reporter induction. However, further removal of a short region (–114 to –51) resulted in a complete loss of BMP-2 responsiveness (Fig. 1B). To test whether this region alone has the ability to render responsiveness to BMP-2, we assayed the responses of a construct containing this 63-bp region (comprising from –114 to –51) upstream of a heterologous c-fos minimal promoter. Whereas the minimal c-fos promoter showed no response at all to BMP-2, BMP-2 activated the construct bearing the enhancer (indicated as wt in Fig. 1C). Homology analysis showed that the –114/–51 region is almost totally conserved among vertebrate species available in databases. Hence, this 63-bp region was analyzed with Matinspector™ (Genomatix), and three putative transcription factor binding sites were detected; a GC-rich region similar to a BMP responsive Smad binding element (28Lopez-Rovira T. Chalaux E. Massague J. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3176-3185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 36Kusanagi K. Inoue H. Ishidou Y. Mishima H.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), a palindromic homeobox binding site (TAATTA), and a CAGAC box. Mutation of the individual enhancer elements in the reporter construct followed by luciferase analysis showed that the homeobox mutant lost BMP-2 responsiveness, whereas no significant effects were observed for the mutated GC-rich construct, and only a slight decrease in the basal levels but not in the induction was observed in the CAGAC box mutation (Fig. 1C). Dlx5 Interacts Directly with the Homeobox Region in the Osterix Promoter and Mediates BMP-2 induced Osx Expression–Because the TAATTA sequence is a canonical homeodomain binding site, we tested different homeobox transcription factors involved in osteogenesis with the ability to bind the TAATTA sequence as putative activators of the Osx promoter. Neither Prx1A, Prx1B, nor Dlx3 showed significant effects, whereas Dlx5 showed more than a 3-fold induction of the promoter (Fig. 2A). Dlx5 failed to induce transcriptional activation of the ΔTAATTA reporter construct (data not shown). Thus, we analyzed whether Dlx5 bound to the BMP-responsive elements of Osx promoter using two complementary approaches. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out incubating GST-Dlx5 protein with probes corresponding to the wild type or the mutated minimal responsive region. GST-Dlx5 was able to bind all the probes except that which contained a mutated homeobox (Fig. 2B). The appearance of the shifted band was abolished by incubation with antibodies against Dlx5, further confirming that the shifted band was indeed Dlx5 (supplemental Fig. 1). Similarly, oligonucleotide pulldown assays of HEK-293 cells overexpressing Dlx5 showed binding of Dlx5 to the homeobox DNA but not when the homeobox sequence was mutated (Fig. 2C). Dlx5 has been shown to be induced in C2C12 cells in response to BMP-2 through the activation of the Smad signaling pathway (6Ryoo H.M. Lee M.H. Kim Y.J. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 366: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 26Lee M.H. Kim Y.J. Kim H.J. Park H.D. Kang A.R. Kyung H.M. Sung J.H. Wozney J.M. Kim H.J. Ryoo H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34387-34394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We analyzed the temporal pattern of expression of both genes to assess whether Dlx5 could act upstream of Osterix. Dlx5 mRNA was induced 1–2 h after BMP-2 addition and increased steadily thereafter. Osterix mRNA levels were also increased showing a delayed profile of induction compared with that of Dlx5 mRNA (Fig. 2D). Similar expression profiles were obtained when the protein levels of Dlx5 and Osx were analyzed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2E). We further analyzed the pattern of expression of both Dlx5 and Osx in the osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1. Similarly to mesenchymal C2C12 cells, BMP-2 induces both Dlx5 and Osx mRNA expression, and the Dlx5 mRNA induction also preceded that of Osx (Fig. 2F). Altogether, these data show that BMP-2 induces both Dlx5 and Osx expression in different mesenchymal cell lines and indicates that the induction of Dlx5 by BMP-2 precedes that of Osx. To directly address a functional role of Dlx5 in Osx expression regulation, we tested two different siRNAs against Dlx5 (J9 and J10) in C2C12 cells. BMP-2-induced Dlx5 mRNA and protein expression were decreased compared with cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA (non-target control (NTC)) (Fig. 3, A and B). BMP-2-induced Osx expression was decreased by the two siRNAs (55% by J9 and 35% by J10 at the mRNA level and 35% by J9 and 20% by J10 at the protein level). Moreover, we also co-transfected C2C12 cells with J9 siRNA against Dlx5 together with the minimal responsive Osx reporter. J9 siRNA decreased both basal and BMP-2 mediated responses (Fig. 3C). These data are also in agreement with previous data using antisense constructs against Dlx5 (27Lee M.H. Kwon T.G. Park H.S. Wozney J.M. Ryoo H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Then we also analyzed the functional effects of up-regulation of Dlx5 expression on the minimal Osx reporter activity assays and endogenous Osx gene expression. Dlx5 overexpression up-regulated transcription of the minimal Osx reporter construct as well as expression of the endogenous Osx gene analyzed by RT-qPCR (Fig. 4). We consistently observed that in cells subjected to transfection procedures, BMP-2 showed a lower ability to stimulate Osx expression. More interestingly, in both experimental assays BMP-2 promoted an additive effect to Dlx5-overexpressing C2C12 cells. These data indicate that, in addition to the induction of Dlx5 expression, BMP-2 activates additional pathways that result in further Osx transcriptional activation.FIGURE 4Dlx5 activates Osx expression. A, transfected C2C12 cells were grown to confluence, serum-starved, and treated with BMP-2 for 16–20h. Luciferase activities are expressed as the mean ± S.E. for triplicates from six independent experiments. B, transfected C2C12 cells were grown to confluence, serum-starved overnight, and treated with BMP-2 for 8 h. Relative values of Osx mRNA expression were obtained by RT-qPCR and expressed as the mean ± S.E. from four independent experiments after normalization by GAPDH expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Dlx5 Is Phosphorylated by p38–The fact that a CAGAC site is also present in the minimal BMP-responsive promoter led us to investigate whether direct binding of Smads was also involved in Osx transcription. However, neither deletion of the CAGAC sequence (Fig. 1C) nor overexpression of Smad1 or Smad4 (data not shown) significantly modify BMP-2 responsiveness of the minimal Osx reporter. Alternatively, it has been shown that BMP-2 activates Smad-independent pathways (37Moustakas A. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3573-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). For instance, activation of p38 MAPK by BMP-2 has been shown to be relevant in the osteogenic effects of this cytokine (38Guicheux J. Lemonnier J. Ghayor C. Suzuki A. Palmer G. Caverzasio J. J.

https://openalex.org/W1985051375,"We previously showed that the 44-kDa serine/threonine kinase Pim-1 (Pim-1L) can protect prostate cancer cells from apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs (Xie, Y., Xu, K., Dai, B., Guo, Z., Jiang, T., Chen, H., and Qiu, Y. (2006) Oncogene 25, 70-78). To further explore the mechanisms of Pim-1L-mediated resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs in prostate cancer cells, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screening to identify cellular proteins that were associated with Pim-1L, and we found the ABC transporter BCRP/ABCG2 as one of the potential interacting partners of Pim-1L. We also showed that the expression level of Pim-1L and BCRP was up-regulated in mitoxantrone and docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell lines. Pim-1L was co-localized with BCRP on the plasma membrane and induced phosphorylation of BCRP at threonine 362. Knocking-down Pim-1L expression in the drug-resistant prostate cancer cells abolished multimer formation of endogenous BCRP and resensitized the resistant cells to chemotherapeutic drugs suggesting that BCRP phosphorylation induced by Pim-1L was essential for its functionality. This is further corroborated by our finding that the plasma membrane localization and drug-resistant activity of BCRP were compromised by T362A mutation. Our data suggest that Pim-1L may protect prostate cancer cells from apoptosis, at least in part, through regulation of transmembrane drug efflux pump. These findings may provide a potential therapeutic approach by disrupting Pim-1 signaling to reverse BCRP-mediated multidrug resistance."

https://openalex.org/W1970513264,"When Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells are starved of inorganic phosphate, the Pho80-Pho85 cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) is inactivated by the Pho81 CDK inhibitor (CKI). The regulation of Pho80-Pho85 is distinct from previously characterized mechanisms of CDK regulation: the Pho81 CKI is constitutively associated with Pho80-Pho85, and a small-molecule ligand, inositol heptakisphosphate (IP7), is required for kinase inactivation. We investigated the molecular basis of the IP7- and Pho81-dependent Pho80-Pho85 inactivation using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, enzyme kinetics and fluorescence spectroscopy. We found that IP7 interacts noncovalently with Pho80-Pho85-Pho81 and induces additional interactions between Pho81 and Pho80-Pho85 that prevent substrates from accessing the kinase active site. Using synthetic peptides corresponding to Pho81, we define regions of Pho81 responsible for constitutive Pho80-Pho85 binding and IP7-regulated interaction and inhibition. These findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms of cyclin-CDK regulation and of the biochemical mechanisms of IP7 action."
https://openalex.org/W2012247982,"HSP90 is a ubiquitously expressed molecular chaperone that controls the folding, assembly, intracellular disposition, and proteolytic turnover of many proteins, most of which are involved in signal transduction processes. Recently, a surface form of HSP90 has been identified and associated with cell migration events. In this paper, we explore the interaction of surface HSP90 with HER-2, a receptor-like glycoprotein and member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases that play central roles in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and migration as well as in cancer progress. The involvement of HSP90 in the regulation of HER-2 has been attributed so far to receptor stabilization via interaction with its cytoplasmic kinase domain. Here we present evidence, using glutathione S-transferase pull-down and transfection assays, for a novel interaction between surface HSP90 and the extracellular domain of HER-2. Specific disruption of this interaction using mAb 4C5, a function-blocking monoclonal antibody against HSP90, inhibits cell invasion accompanied by altered actin dynamics in human breast cancer cells under ligand stimulation conditions with heregulin. Additionally, disruption of surface HSP90/HER-2 interaction leads to inhibition of heregulin-induced HER-2-HER-3 heterodimer formation, reduced HER-2 phosphorylation, and impaired downstream kinase signaling. Interestingly, this disruption does not affect HER-2 internalization. Our data suggest that surface HSP90 is involved in heregulin-induced HER-2 activation and signaling, leading to cytoskeletal rearrangement, essential for cell invasion.

HSP90 is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that in higher eukaryotes exists in two isoforms that share 86% amino acid conservation (HSP90α and HSP90β). It is one of the most abundant cytoplasmic proteins in unstressed cells, where it performs housekeeping functions, controlling the activity, intracellular disposition, and proteolytic turnover of a variety of proteins (4Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar, 5Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). So far, at least 100 proteins are known to be regulated by HSP90, including key mediators of signal transduction and cell cycle control, steroid hormone receptors, and tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases (6Picard D.

Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2003; 15: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). HSP90 keeps these unstable proteins poised for activation through low affinity interactions, characterized by repeated ATP-dependent cycles of binding and release, until they are stabilized by conformational changes associated with signal transduction (2Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 10Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Over the past years, there has been increasing evidence that HSP90 interacts with a great number of molecules that are involved in the development and/or survival of cancer cells (11Goetz M.P.

The receptor tyrosine kinase HER-2 (also known as ErbB-2) is a protein whose stability depends on HSP90 function (13Zhou P. Fernandes N. Dodge I.L. Reddi A.L. Rao N. Safran H. DiPetrillo T.A. Wazer D.E. Band V. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13829-13837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). HER-2 is a 185-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein and a member of the ErbB family of epidermal growth factor receptors (14Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 15Hynes N.E. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar, 16Rubin I. Yarden Y. Ann. Oncol. 2001; 12: S3-S8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Binding of ligands to the extracellular domain (ECD) of ErbB receptors induces the formation of receptor homo- and heterodimers and the activation of their intrinsic kinase domain, resulting in phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic tail. The latter serve as docking sites for various adaptor proteins or enzymes, which simultaneously initiate many signaling cascades to produce a physiological outcome (17Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5477) Google Scholar). HER-2 is a ligandless receptor and the preferred heterodimerization partner for ligand-bound epidermal growth factor receptor family members HER-1, HER-3, and HER-4 (17Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5477) Google Scholar, 18Tzahar E. Waterman H. Chen X. Levkowitz G. Karunagaran D. Lavi S. Ratzkin B.J. Yarden Y. Mol.

By functioning as co-receptor, HER-2 mediates signal transduction, resulting in cell motility, mitogenesis, apoptosis, angiogenesis, or cell differentiation. Any alteration of the tightly regulated ErbB receptor signaling pathways results in major cellular abnormalities and tumorigenesis. For example, abnormalities in the expression, structure, or activity of HER-2 contribute to the development and maintenance of the malignant phenotype (20Marmor M.D. Skaria K.B. Yarden Y. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 2004; 58: 903-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression or amplification of the HER-2 receptor is associated with increased progression and metastasis in human breast cancer (21Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A.

The role of HSP90 in the regulation of HER-2 has been attributed so far to stabilization of the receptor at the cell surface, via interaction with its cytoplasmic kinase domain, such that disruption of the HER-2/HSP90 association induced by HSP90 inhibitors (e.g. geldanamycin) leads to proteosomal degradation of the receptor (23Mimnaugh E.G. Chavany C. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22796-22801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 24Xu W. Mimnaugh E. Rosser M.F. Nicchitta C. Marcu M. Yarden Y.

Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others have shown that HSP90 is localized not only in the cytoplasm but also on the cell surface (26Sidera K. Samiotaki M. Yfanti E. Panayotou G. Patsavoudi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45379-45388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Becker B. Multhoff G. Farkas B. Wild P.J.

Henning S.W. Beste G. Scroggins B.T. Neckers L. Ilag L.L. Jay D.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that surface HSP90 contributes to cell migration processes via cytoskeletal rearrangement during normal embryonic development of the nervous tissue, by exploiting a function-blocking monoclonal antibody, mAb 4C5, that recognizes both the α and, to a lesser extent, the β isoform of the HSP90 protein (26Sidera K. Samiotaki M. Yfanti E. Panayotou G. Patsavoudi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45379-45388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 29Yfanti E. Nagata I. Patsavoudi E. J.

Finally, we have obtained results showing that mAb 4C5 inhibits B16 F10 melanoma cell invasion and metastasis by binding selectively to surface HSP90 (31Stellas D. Karameris A. Patsavoudi E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Taking into consideration the above, together with the fact that the migration mechanisms occurring in normal nonneoplastic cells during embryonic development are similar, if not identical, to the invasion processes of tumor cells during metastasis, in this study we examine the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of surface HSP90 in cancer cell invasion processes. For the first time, we show here that surface HSP90 interacts directly with the ECD of HER-2 and participates in heregulin (HRG)-induced cancer cell invasion. Moreover, specific disruption of the surface HSP90/HER-2 interaction under ligand stimulation conditions leads to inhibition of HER-2-HER-3 heterodimer formation, reduced HER-2 phosphorylation, and impaired downstream kinase signaling, without affecting HER-2 endosomal trafficking. Our combined data strongly suggest that surface HSP90 is involved in HRG-induced HER-2 activation and signaling, which in turn will activate cytoplasmic signal transduction cascades leading to cytoskeletal rearrangement, essential for cell motility. Antibodies and Reagents—mAb 4C5 was produced in our laboratory, as previously described (32Thomaidou D. Patsavoudi E. Neuroscience. 1993; 53: 813-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the present study, mAb 4C5 was used as concentrated serum-free supernatant in all experiments performed. Polyclonal antibodies against HER-2 or tyrosine-phosphorylated HER-2 were obtained from Cell Signaling. Polyclonal antibodies against HSP70 as well as the phosphorylated and total forms of Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinases were a kind gift from Dr. N. Grammatikakis. Polyclonal antibody against HER-3 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). RPMI and fetal bovine serum (FBS), were from Invitrogen. All other materials were from sources previously described (26Sidera K. Samiotaki M. Yfanti E. Panayotou G. Patsavoudi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45379-45388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cell Cultures and Immunofluorescence—Two different human breast cancer cell lines were used, MDAMB453, which is a HER-2-overexpressing cell line, and MDAMB435, which expresses very low levels of endogenous HER-2 (33Neve R.M. Chin K. Fridlyand J. Yeh J. Baehner F.L. Fevr T. Clark L. Bayani N. Coppe J.P. Tong F. Speed T. Spellman P.T. DeVries S. Lapuk A. Wang N.J. Kuo W.L. Stilwell J.L. Pinkel D. Albertson D.G.

Both cell lines were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. For immunofluorescence studies, MDAMB453 cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in a 48-well plate and cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS. After 24 h, cells were shifted to serum-free medium for 48 h and were then treated or not with 200 μg/ml mAb 4C5 for 2 h. Excess antibody was then removed by replacing the culture medium with fresh medium, and cells were exposed or not to HRG (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. Cells were then fixed and processed for indirect immunofluorescence, as previously described (32Thomaidou D. Patsavoudi E. Neuroscience. 1993; 53: 813-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Live MDAMB453 cells and transiently transfected MDAMB435 cells were labeled by indirect immunofluorescence as previously reported (26Sidera K. Samiotaki M. Yfanti E. Panayotou G. Patsavoudi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45379-45388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Alexa488-labeled phalloidin and Alexa546-conjugated transferrin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were used to visualize F-actin and transferrin receptor, respectively, and the far red wavelength, DNA-intercalating dye To-pro-3 (Molecular Probes) was used for nuclear staining. For all experiments, controls were performed by omitting the primary antibodies and/or by using an IgG2a monoclonal antibody against the unrelated neuronal protein BM88 (34Patsavoudi E. Hurel C. Matsas R. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 782-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Additional negative controls were performed using a polyclonal antibody against β-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunofluorescence was analyzed by confocal microscopy using a Leica TSC confocal microscope. Antibody Internalization Assay—MDAMB453 cells were incubated while in culture with 200 μg/ml mAb 4C5 for 2, 8, and 24 h. The cells were then washed in RPMI and fixed in cold acetone for 3 min. For detection of possible internalization of the antibody, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and subsequently incubated with Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). For all experiments, controls were performed as mentioned above. Cell Fractionation—Cellular fractionation was performed in cell cultures prepared and treated as above, using the Compartmental protein extraction kit (Chemicon), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein lysates were quantified, and equal amounts of total protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Protein estimations were performed with the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Wound Healing Migration Assay—The assay was performed as previously described (35Meintanis S. Thomaidou D. Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Matsas R. Glia. 2001; 34: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, MDAMB453 and MDAMB435 cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in a 48-well plate at a density of 105 cells/well and were left for 24 h in serum-containing medium, without further treatment. The medium was then changed to serum-free RPMI, and 16 h later, a cell-free area was generated by gently scratching the cell monolayer with a sterile yellow Gilson-pipette tip, thus resulting in the formation of an ∼1-mm-wide cell-free area. Immediately after scratching, the medium was replaced with fresh medium, containing mAb 4C5 (200 μg/ml) and/or HRG (100 ng/ml) and/or Herceptin (1 μg/ml). All agents were maintained in the culture for the duration of the assay. Control cultures were grown either in culture medium alone (RPMI) or in culture medium containing a 200 μg/ml concentration of an IgG2a monoclonal antibody (concentrated serum-free hybridoma supernatant) against the unrelated protein BM88 (34Patsavoudi E. Hurel C. Matsas R. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 782-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Migration of breast cancer cells within the gap was monitored microscopically at given time intervals, using a Leica DM IL inverted microscope, equipped with a LEICA DM300 video camera connected to a computer. Migration distance was estimated by acquiring and analyzing digital images, using the Image Pro Plus analysis software (35Meintanis S. Thomaidou D. Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Matsas R. Glia. 2001; 34: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 36Lavdas A.A. Franceschini I. Dubois-Dalcq M. Matsas R. Glia. 2006; 53: 868-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and expressed as the percentage of distance covered by cells in control cultures. Statistical analysis was performed by using Student's t test. Bromodeoxyuridine Incorporation Assay—Serum-starved MDAMB453 cells cultured in the presence of mAb 4C5 and/or HRG were exposed to bromodeoxyuridine at a concentration of 10-5 m for 4 h. Cells were subsequently rinsed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After washing, the cells were incubated in 2 m HCl containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, followed by a 20-min incubation in 0.1 m sodium borate and then processed for indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibody (DAKO) followed by an appropriate Alexa488-conjugated goat secondary antibody. Plasmid Construction—The rat HER-2 full-length cDNA (4478 bp cloned into the pCMV.SPORT6.1 vector) was obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium Library, Medical Research Council Geneservice (clone MGC: 72502; IMAGE: 5597835). For construction of GST-HER-2 plasmids, PCR was performed using Phusion polymerase (Finzymes). For production of the ECD of rat HER-2, the following forward (F) and reverse (R) primers were used: FECD1, 5′-CCGGAATTCATGATCATCATGGAGCTGGCTG-3′; RECD1, 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCCTGCTCTGCTGGGCAGCCT-3′. The resulting PCR product (1996 bp), encoding amino acids 1-650 (see Fig. 3A) was subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) between EcoRI and NotI cloning sites. The intracellular domain (ICD) of rat HER-2 was also produced by PCR using the primers FICD1 (5′-CCGGAATTCCGAAGGAGACAGAAGATCCGCAAGTAT-3′) and RICD1 (5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTACAGGTACATCCAGGCCTA-3′), and the resulting PCR product (1783 bp) encoding amino acids 681-1259 (see Fig. 3A) was subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 between EcoRI and NotI cloning sites. Both plasmids were subjected to sequence analysis and were then used to transform BL21 cells for production of GST-HER-2 chimeric proteins. In order to perform transient transfection experiments, the ECD of HER-2, corresponding to amino acids 1-683, including the transmembrane domain (TM) and four intracellular amino acids (KRRR), as well as the ICD of HER-2, corresponding to amino acids 684-1259 were generated by PCR (see Fig. 4D), using the following primers, respectively: FECD2 (5′-CCGGAATCCGCCACCATGATCATCATGGACTGG-3), RECD2 (5′-CCCAAGCTTTCTCCTTCGTTTGATTAGGATTCC-3′), FICD2 (5′-CCGGAATCCGCCACCATGCAGAAGATCCGCAGTAT-3′), and RICD2 (5′-CCCAAGCTTTACAGGTACATCCAGGCCTAGGTA-3′). A control fragment of HER-2, corresponding to amino acids 651-750, that would not bind HSP90 (negative control) was also generated by PCR using the following primers: Fneg (5′-CCGGAATTCGCCACCATGAGAGCCAGCCCGGT-3′) and Rneg (5′-CCCAAGCTTCACATTCTCCCCATCTGGGATCCAGATGCC-3′). The resulting PCR products (2080, 1770, and 300 bp, respectively) were subcloned into pcDNA3A Myc/His (Invitrogen) between EcoR1 and HindIII cloning sites, in frame with Myc/His epitope. Plasmids were subjected to sequence analysis and then used to transiently transfect MDAMB435 cells, which express very low levels of endogenous HER-2. GST Pull-down Assays—GST-ECD, GST-ICD, and control GST proteins were expressed in BL21 cells after induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For GST pull-down assays, equal amounts of GST-ECD, GST-ICD, and control GST proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (50 μl) were incubated with 5 mg of rat brain fractions, solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C overnight. The beads were subsequently washed three times with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm ATP, and 1% Nonidet P-40 and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Following boiling, proteins were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with mAb 4C5. Preparation of Brain Fractions—HSP90-enriched fractions were obtained as previously described (26Sidera K. Samiotaki M. Yfanti E. Panayotou G. Patsavoudi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45379-45388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Protein estimations were performed using the Bradford method. Transient Transfections—MDAMB435 breast cancer cells were plated on 6-well plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well and transiently transfected with either the ECD, the ICD, the negative control fragment of HER-2, or the empty pcDNA.3A vector, using the FUGENE transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). The cells were then cultured in RPMI complemented with 10% FBS for 48 h and subsequently lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation assays using a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen) in order to discriminate transgene from endogenous expression of HER-2. Preparation of Cell Lysates, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—MDAMB453 cells grown in 6-well plates in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS until subconfluence were shifted in serum-free medium for 24 h and then exposed or not to 200 μg/ml mAb 4C5 for 2 h. Excess nonbound antibody was then removed by washing with fresh medium, and cells were stimulated (or not) with HRG (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. The cultures were immediately washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 50 μl of lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton, 10% glycerol, 200 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin). Protein lysates were quantified, and equal amounts of total protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were blotted for 40 min at room temperature with nonfat dry milk (5%) in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 to block nonspecific binding sites and were then incubated with specific primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed with 0.3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with Tris-buffered saline, the bound antibody complex was detected using an ECL chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) as described by the manufacturers. Co-immunoprecipitation was Performed as Previously Described (37Mahajan V.B. Pai K.S. Lau A. Cunningham D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12062-12067Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In brief, equal amounts of precleared cellular lysates or brain fractions were incubated with antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose and washed three times with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Western blot as described above. For all immunoprecipitation experiments, negative controls were performed using irrelevant IgGs. Chemical Cross-linking—MDAMB453 cells were incubated with mAb 4C5 (200 μg/ml) and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml HRG as described above. Cross-linking was performed as previously described (38Johannessen L.E. Haugen K.E. Ostvold A.C. Stang E. Madshus I.H. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated on ice for 30 min with PBS containing a 3 mm concentration of the nonpermeable cross-linking reagent bis(sulfo-succinimidyl) suberate (Pierce). To stop the cross-linking reaction, glycine (20 mm final concentration) was added, and the cells were further incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed three times in ice-cold PBS and lysed. Protein complexes were analyzed using a gradient 3-8% Tris acetate NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen). Receptor Internalization—In order to determine whether the internalization of HER-2 is affected by mAb 4C5, we examined the receptor's endocytic trafficking using a fluorescence microscope. Briefly, serum-starved MDAMB543 cells grown in glass coverslips were treated or not with 200 μg/ml mAb 4C5 for 2 h, subsequently exposed or not to HRG (100 ng/ml) for 15 min, and surface-labeled for 60 min on ice with 100 μg/ml Alexa546-conjugated transferrin. Cells were then washed three times with cold RPMI and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time intervals. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and labeled with anti-HER-2 antibody by indirect immunofluorescence. mAb 4C5 Binds to the Cell Surface and Is Not Internalized by MDAMB453 Cells—In order to investigate whether HSP90 is present on the surface of HER-2-overexpressing MDAMB453 cells, unfixed cultures were incubated with mAb 4C5. The cells were then carefully washed, fixed, and labeled with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody. Thus, the primary antibody had access only to the external surface of the cells. The observed typical punctuate immunostaining confirmed the cell surface localization of HSP90 (Fig. 1A). It should be noted that similar results were obtained when using commercial anti-HSP90α and anti-HSP90β antibodies (Fig. 1A). Control experiments using an antibody to the intracellular protein β-tubulin (Fig. 1A) and a mouse monoclonal antibody against BM88, an intracellular unrelated protein (data not shown), did not produce any detectable surface staining. At this point, it should be noted that mAb 4C5 also recognizes the intracellular HSP90 as demonstrated by immunofluorescence after fixation and permeabilization of MDAMB453 cells (Fig. 1B). Apparent β-tubulin staining is also observed under fixed conditions (Fig. 1B). The above results were confirmed by Western blot of MDAMB453 cell fractions, using mAb 4C5 as well as the commercial anti-HSP90α and anti-HSP90β antibodies (Fig. 1C). As positive controls, anti-HER-2, anti-HSP70, and anti-phosphohistone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) antibodies were used for the membrane, cytoplasmic, and nuclear fractions, respectively. Negative controls were performed using β-tubulin, which is absent in all of the above fractions but present in a separate cytoskeletal fraction (Fig. 1C). The binding of mAb 4C5 to living MDAMB453 cells was examined at various time intervals by incubating the cells with mAb 4C5 at 37 °C for 2, 8, and 24 h. The cells were th"

Here, we report that Ca2+ depletion induces E-cadherin ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation and that Cdc42 plays an important role in regulating this process. We demonstrate that Ca2+ depletion induces activation of Cdc42. This in turn up-regulates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling to mediate Src activation, leading to E-cadherin ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation. Silencing Cdc42 blocks activation of EGFR and Src induced by Ca2+ depletion, resulting in a reduction in E-cadherin degradation. The role of Cdc42 in regulating E-cadherin ubiquitination and degradation is underscored by the fact that constitutively active Cdc42(F28L) increases the activity of EGFR and Src and significantly enhances E-cadherin ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation. Furthermore, we found that GTP-dependent binding of Cdc42 to E-cadherin is critical for Cdc42 to induce the dissolution of adherens junctions. Our data support a model that activation of Cdc42 contributes to mesenchyme-like phenotype by targeting of E-cadherin for lysosomal degradation.

Our data support a model that activation of Cdc42 contributes to mesenchyme-like phenotype by targeting of E-cadherin for lysosomal degradation. Adherens junctions are one of the major structures responsible for cell-cell adhesion between epithelial cells, and their formation is required for the establishment of a differentiated epithelium (1Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Adherens junctions form by Ca2+-dependent homophilic interactions between neighboring cells mediated by type I receptors known as cadherins (2Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2894) Google Scholar, 3Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar). Adherens junctions are dynamic structures that are remodeled as needed based on cellular conditions such as during embryonic development and wound healing. Remodeling of adherens junctions requires endocytosis and recycling of E-cadherin (4Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). During epithelial tumor progression, disruption of adherens junctions and decreased E-cadherin expression occurs and contributes to epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT) 4The abbreviations used are: EMTepithelial to mesenchymal transitionsEGFRepidermal growth factor (EGF) receptorHAhemagglutininDMEMDulbecco'smodifiedEagle'smedium;FBS,fetalbovineserum;siRNA,shortinterfering RNAWCLwhole cell lysatesPBDp21 binding domainGSTglutathione S-transferasewtwild typeERKextracellular signal-regulated kinase. 4The abbreviations used are: EMTepithelial to mesenchymal transitionsEGFRepidermal growth factor (EGF) receptorHAhemagglutininDMEMDulbecco'smodifiedEagle'smedium;FBS,fetalbovineserum;siRNA,shortinterfering RNAWCLwhole cell lysatesPBDp21 binding domainGSTglutathione S-transferasewtwild typeERKextracellular signal-regulated kinase. (5Birchmeier W. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although sustained repression of E-cadherin occurs at the transcriptional level, initial decreases in E-cadherin levels likely occur by lysosomal degradation (6Janda E. Nevolo M. Lehmann K. Downward J. Beug H. Grieco M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7117-7130Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 7Palacios F. Tushir J.S. Fujita Y. Souza-Schorey C. Mol. Cell.

Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) correlates with metastasis in breast cancer and other carcinomas. EGF stimulation of epithelial cells has previously been shown to disrupt adherens junctions (8Muller T. Bain G. Wang X. Papkoff J. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 280: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and chronic stimulation causes up-regulation of E-cadherin transcriptional repressors such as TWIST and Snail (9Lo H.W. Hsu S.C. Xia W. Cao X. Shih J.Y. Wei Y. Abbruzzese J.L. Hortobagyi G.N. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9066-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 10Lu Z. Ghosh S. Wang Z. Hunter T. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 499-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Conversely, inhibition of EGFR signaling contributes to increased E-cadherin protein levels and restoration of adherens junctions in lung cancer and breast cancer cell lines (11Al Moustafa A.E. Yen L. Benlimame N. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Lung Cancer. 2002; 37: 49-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12Hazan R.B. Norton L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9078-9084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that increased EGFR signaling contributes to sustained repression of E-cadherin expression, it is not known whether or not EGFR contributes to the initial down-regulation of E-cadherin by lysosomal degradation. Src, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, is a central regulator of signaling downstream of EGFR and has been shown to regulate EMT by disrupting adherens junctions (13Ishizawar R. Parsons S.J. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 209-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 14Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5366) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, Src alters E-cadherin trafficking by redirecting E-cadherin from a recycling pathway to a lysosomal-targeting pathway (7Palacios F. Tushir J.S. Fujita Y. Souza-Schorey C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In Madin-Darby canine kidney cells Src phosphorylation of E-cadherin leads to binding of the E3 ligase Hakai; Hakai then ubiquitinates E-cadherin, resulting in E-cadherin endocytosis (15Fujita Y. Krause G. Scheffner M. Zechner D. Leddy H.E. Behrens J. Sommer T. Birchmeier W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The downstream effect of Hakai-mediated E-cadherin ubiquitination and endocytosis has not been characterized. Rho family GTPases, including Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA, have all been found to regulate adherens junctions (16Braga V. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). The majority of data indicate that Rho GTPases contribute to the establishment and stabilization of adherens junctions in mouse L fibroblasts expressing E-cadherin (EL cells) (18Fukata M. Kuroda S. Nakagawa M. Kawajiri A. Itoh N. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S. Fujisawa H. Kikuchi A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol.

Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1998; 281: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). For instance, Cdc42 and Rac1 stabilize adherens junctions in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, and activation of both contributes to the initial formation of adherens junctions (20Kim S.H. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 21Nakagawa M. Fukata M. Yamaga M. Itoh N. Kaibuchi K. J.

It has been recently reported that FRG, a Cdc42-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, regulates cell junction assembly through activation of Cdc42 in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (23Fukuyama T. Ogita H. Kawakatsu T. Fukuhara T. Yamada T. Sato T. Shimizu K. Nakamura T. Matsuda M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 815-825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, there are also data that suggest Rac1 and Cdc42 contribute to dissolution of adherens junctions in human epidermal keratinocytes (24Akhtar N. Hudson K.R. Hotchin N.A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 2000; 7: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Akhtar N. Hotchin N.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). For Rac1, disruption of adherens junctions is in part mediated by stimulating endocytosis of E-cadherin (25Akhtar N. Hotchin N.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Overexpression of constitutively active Cdc42 was also found to prevent adherens junction formation in keratinocytes, suggesting that Cdc42 may negatively regulate adherens junction establishment (26Hirsch D.S. Pirone D.M. Burbelo P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 875-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Activation of Cdc42 in fibroblast cells has been reported to inhibit Cbl-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR, resulting in cellular transformation due to the accumulation of EGFR and sustained EGF-stimulated ERK activation (27Wu W.J. Tu S. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2003; 114: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, down-regulation of Cdc42 restores EGFR degradation and decreases cell migration (28Hirsch D.S. Shen Y. Wu W.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3523-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Based on this information, we hypothesized that Cdc42 might regulate E-cadherin degradation through an ubiquitin-mediated pathway to dissolute adherens junctions and positively regulate cell migration. Given the roles of Cdc42, Src, and EGFR in adherens junction dynamics, we addressed the question of whether signaling through Cdc42, EGFR, and Src cooperatively contributes to the dissolution of adherens junctions, leading to E-cadherin ubiquitination and degradation. Here, we provide evidence that after endocytosis induced by Ca2+ depletion, E-cadherin is ubiquitinated and targeted for lysosomal degradation and that Cdc42 plays a critical role in regulating this process through an EGFR to Src signaling pathway. We demonstrate that Cdc42 is activated under Ca2+-free conditions. Activation of Cdc42 subsequently initiates the activation of EGFR and Src. Activated Src in turn tyrosine-phosphorylates E-cadherin, leading to Hakai-mediated E-cadherin ubiquitination. These data are supported by the results that silencing Cdc42 inhibits activation of EGFR and Src, resulting in a reduction in E-cadherin degradation. When Cdc42 is constitutively activated, as is the case for Cdc42(F28L), an oncogenic mutant that undergoes spontaneous activation (29Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 30Wu W.J. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16655-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the persistent activation of EGFR and Src leads to a significant enhancement in E-cadherin ubiquitination and degradation, causing the dissolution of E-cadherin-based adherens junctions and an increased rate of cell migration. Furthermore, our data indicate that activated Cdc42 binds to E-cadherin in a GTP-dependent manner, and the binding of Cdc42 is essential for Cdc42 to induce the dissolution of adherens junctions. Antibodies–Antibodies against E-cadherin (clone 36), EGFR, and activated EGFR were from BD Transduction Laboratories.

Transient transfections using Lipofectin and PLUS reagent were done according to the manufacturer's protocol. SMARTpool short interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting human Cdc42, human Hakai, and control non-targeting siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon (Chicago, IL). MG132 proteasome inhibitor was purchased from Calbiochem. Tyrphostin AG1478 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. For EGFR inhibition studies, cells were seeded in the morning and allowed to attach and spread for 8 h. Me2SO (control) or AG1478 (at 10 μm) was then added overnight. Cells were then switched to Ca2+-free DMEM in the presence of Me2SO or AG1478 (10 μm) for the indicated times. E-cadherin Ubiquitination and Degradation–MCF-7 cells were seeded overnight in 10% FBS/DMEM, and then cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline before switching to Ca2+-free DMEM. At the indicated times cells were harvested, and whole cell lysates (WCL) were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-E-cadherin antibody. Ubiquitinated E-cadherin was detected by Western blot with anti-ubiquitin antibody. The immunoprecipitated E-cadherin as indicated above or protein levels of E-cadherin in WCL harvested at the indicated time points were detected by Western blot using anti-E-cadherin antibody for assessing E-cadherin degradation. E-cadherin Internalization and Recycling Assays–Internalization and recycling assays were done as previously described (4Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 31Le T.L. Joseph S.R. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. Am. J. Physiol.

MCF-7 cells and Cdc42(F28L)-expressing MCF-7 (clone 19) cells were seeded overnight at 1.5 × 106 cells/35-mm dish in complete media. Cells were biotinylated using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). For recycling assays, accumulation of biotinylated proteins in early or sorting endocytic compartments was accomplished by incubating cells for 2 h at 18 °C (32Czekay R.P. Orlando R.A. Woodward L. Lundstrom M. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 517-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 33Dunn K.W. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J.

Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Biotinylated proteins from radioimmune precipitation assay buffer-extracted WCL, and media were affinity-precipitated using immobilized NeutrAvidin™ protein per the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). Levels of biotinylated E-cadherin were determined by Western blot using anti-E-cadherin (HECD) antibody. p21 Binding Domain (PBD) Assay–The determination of the levels of GTP-bound Cdc42 were done using the GST-PBD of p21-activated kinase (PAK) as described previously (36Bagrodia S.

Immunofluorescence–Cells were seeded overnight on chamber slides at 1 × 105 cells/well in 10% FBS/DMEM. Cells were then rinsed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for the indicated times in DMEM or Ca2+-free DMEM. Cells were fixed and stained as previously described (28Hirsch D.S. Shen Y. Wu W.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3523-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Actin was detected using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen Molecular Probes). Src was detected using rabbit anti-Src (36D10). Migration Assays–Boyden chamber migrations assays, fixation, and staining were done as described previously (37Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and then fixed and stained. Wound healing assays are described in the Fig. 2E legend. Ca2+ Depletion Induces Ubiquitination and Degradation of E-cadherin–Although E-cadherin endocytosis represents an important cellular process that regulates the assembly and disassembly of adherens junction, E-cadherin trafficking after endocytosis is not yet thoroughly understood. We used MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which express high levels of endogenous E-cadherin, as a model system to explore the molecular mechanisms of E-cadherin trafficking. We set out to investigate whether endocytosed E-cadherin induced by Ca2+ depletion can be targeted for lysosomal degradation. Cells were switched to Ca2+-free media to initiate E-cadherin endocytosis and harvested at the indicated time points, and then E-cadherin proteins were immunoprecipitated from WCL. Western blotting was used to detect E-cadherin protein levels (Fig. 1A). A significant reduction in E-cadherin protein levels was observed after a 3-h incubation in Ca2+-free media. Two lower molecular weight protein bands that are likely E-cadherin degradation products were also recognized by the anti-E-cadherin antibody after incubation of cells in Ca2+-free media (Fig. 1A, arrows). We next tested whether E-cadherin was ubiquitinated upon Ca2+ depletion. Significant ubiquitination of immunoprecipitated E-cadherin was observed after a 3-h Ca2+ depletion (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 2, upper image), and E-cadherin ubiquitination was not detected when control IgG was used for immunoprecipitation (lanes 3 and 4). Decreased total protein levels of E-cadherin and the two lower protein bands were also detected in WCL upon Ca2+ depletion (lanes 2 and 4 in Fig. 1B, middle image). To confirm the ubiquitination of E-cadherin under Ca2+-free conditions, we transiently expressed HA-ubiquitin in MCF-7 cells. The experimental procedures for Fig. 1C were essentially the same as described in Fig. 1B, except the immunoprecipitated E-cadherin was detected by anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 1C, Ca2+ depletion significantly induced E-cadherin ubiquitination that was not detected when control IgG was used for immunoprecipitation. To elucidate the role of the proteasome in Ca2+ depletion-induced E-cadherin ubiquitination and degradation, we treated cells with MG132, a proteasomal inhibitor. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1, B and C, upon Ca2+ depletion, E-cadherin was ubiquitinated and degraded (Fig. 1D, lane 3, top three images). However, treatment of cells with MG132 did not prevent E-cadherin degradation but appeared to increase its ubiquitination and degradation (lane 4 in Fig. 1D, top three images), suggesting that Ca2+ depletion induced E-cadherin degradation may occur in lysosomes. We next determined if E-cadherin was transported to lysosomes. As shown in Fig. 1E, E-cadherin colocalized with the lysosomal marker LAMP-1 in a perinuclear compartment after a 1-h Ca2+ depletion, whereas there was no significant colocalization between E-cadherin and LAMP-1 when cells were cultured in Ca2+-containing media. After 1 h of incubation in Ca2+-free media, ∼20% of cells had E-cadherin colocalization with LAMP-1 as compared with 5% of cells grown in Ca2+ containing media (Fig. 1E, graph). Taken together, we conclude that E-cadherin ubiquitination can be induced by Ca2+ depletion, and ubiquitinated E-cadherin is targeted for lysosomal degradation. Ca2+ Depletion Triggers the Activation of Cdc42 and Enhances the Rate of Cell Migration–Under Ca2+-free conditions, we observed that MCF-7 cells gradually dissociated, depolarized, and formed numerous cellular protrusions (Fig. 2A, right panels). Results from staining cells with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin to detect actin suggested that the cellular protrusions observed under Ca2+-free conditions were microspikes or filopodia (Fig. 2B). It is well established that activation of Cdc42 triggers the formation of filopodia (38Nobes C.D. Hall A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). We then asked whether Ca2+ depletion induced the activation of Cdc42. A GST-PBD pulldown assay provided evidence that levels of activated Cdc42 were elevated under Ca2+-free conditions (Fig. 2C, compare 0 h to 1 and 3 h). Taken together, these data suggest that the Ca2+-free media-induced filopodium formation might be the direct consequence of Cdc42 activation. Activation of Cdc42 has been implicated in the regulation of cell migration (38Nobes C.D. Hall A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). We next tested whether depletion of Ca2+ could increase the rate of cell migration. As measured by Boyden chamber and wound healing migration assays, cell migration in Ca2+-free media was significantly increased as compared with that in Ca2+ containing media (Fig. 2, D and E). Activation of Cdc42 Enhances Ubiquitination and Degradation of E-cadherin, Resulting in Dissolution of Adherens Junctions and an Increased Rate of Cell Migration–We next asked whether activation of Cdc42 had the ability to regulate E-cadherin ubiquitination and degradation. MCF-7 cell lines stably expressing different levels of Cdc42(F28L) (clones 19, 13, and 7; see Fig. 3B) and vector control cells were incubated in DMEM without Ca2+ for the indicated times, and then E-cadherin protein levels in WCL were detected by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 3A, increased reduction in E-cadherin protein levels was observed in cells stably expressing Cdc42(F28L) (clones 19, 13, and 7). However, the extent of E-cadherin degradation under Ca2+-free conditions was significantly increased in cells with a high expression of Cdc42(F28L) (clones 19 and 13) as compared with that in vector control cells such that the total E-cadherin protein levels were dramatically reduced in clones 19 and 13 cells after cells were incubated in Ca2+-free media for 1 h (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 8). The relative amounts of HA-tagged Cdc42(F28L) expressed in the different MCF-7 stable cell lines (clones 19, 13, and 7) are presented in Fig. 3B. We next compared ubiquitination levels between vector control cells and MCF-7 Cdc42(F28L) cells (clones 19, 13, and 7). The levels of E-cadherin ubiquitination induced by Ca2+ depletion were elevated in cells stably expressing Cdc42(F28L) as compared with that in vector control cells (compare lanes 3-5 to lane 2). The extent of E-cadherin ubiquitination was not distinguishable among the different clones of Cdc42(F28L)-expressing MCF-7 cells. This may be due to the detection limit of this particular assay. Taken together, these data indicate that activation of Cdc42 enhanced E-cadherin degradation under Ca2+-free conditions. We next tested whether activation of Cdc42 led to the dissolution of E-cadherin-based adherens junctions. Although transient expression of wild-type Cdc42 and dominant negative Cdc42(T17N) had no effect on E-cadherin localization at adherens junctions (Fig. 3D, top and bottom panels), expression of Cdc42(Q61L) produced filopodium formation and induced the disappearance of E-cadherin-based adherens junctions (Fig. 3D, middle panels). Adherens junctions were then examined in the MCF-7 stables cell lines. MCF-7 vector control cells had robust colocalization between E-cadherin and actin at adherens junctions (Fig. 3E, left panels). In contrast, filopodia induced by the stable expression of Cdc42(F28L) interrupted E-cadherin-based adherens junctions (Fig. 3E, right panels). Taken together, these data indicate that expression of activated Cdc42 in MCF-7 cells disrupts the polarized epithelial morphology and contributes to the development of a mesenchyme-like morphology. A strong correlation between loss of E-cadherin at the level of the cell surface and enhanced cell invasiveness has been described (39Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). We tested whether Cdc42(F28L) had the ability to increase cell migration using a Boyden chamber assay. MCF-7 cells stably expressing Cdc42(F28L) (clone 19) exhibited approximately a 2-fold increase in the rate of cell migration as compared with control MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3F), consistent with data shown in Fig. 2, D and E. Expression of Cdc42(F28L) Enhances Degradation of Internalized E-cadherin and Reduces E-cadherin Recycling–Given that the current paradigm for the fate of endocytosed E-cadherin is recycling back to the cell surface (4Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 31Le T.L. Joseph S.R. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we then tested whether activation of Cdc42 influenced E-cadherin internalization and recycling. Using a biotinylation endocytosis/recycling assay system previously described (4Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), we found that biotinylated E-cadherin was internalized to a similar extent for both vector control cells and Cdc42(F28L)-expressing cells at 15 min after shifting the temperature to 37 °C (Fig. 4A, top panel, compare lanes 2 and 6), indicating that active Cdc42(F28L) did not affect the rate of E-cadherin internalization. Although the protein levels of internalized E-cadherin were slightly reduced in vector control cells over a time period of 15 min to 1 h (compare lanes 2-4 in the top panels), internalized E-cadherin levels were significantly decreased in Cdc42(F28L)-expressing cells (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 6 and 8). These data indicate that the internalized biotinylated E-cadherin was degraded, and the rate of degradation was enhanced in Cdc42(F28L)-expressing cells as compared with vector control cells, consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3A. We next examined whether Cdc42 was involved in the regulation of E-cadherin recycling. As shown in Fig. 4B, relatively similar amounts of E-cadherin ectodomain were detected in the medium of vector control cells upon switching to 37 °C for the indicated times (second panel from the top), indicating that E-cadherin was recycled to cell surface at a similar rate over the time period of 30-60 min. In contrast, less E-cadherin was recycled back to the cell surface in Cdc42(F28L)-expressing cells as compared with vector control cells at 30 min, and the E-cadherin ectodomain was below the level of detection in the medium of cells expressing Cdc42(F28L) after 60 min of incubation at 37 °C (bottom panel). These data when taken together with Fig. 4A imply that in Cdc42(F28L)-expressing cells internalized E-cadherin was targeted for degradation rather than recycled back to the cell surface. Overall, these results suggest that expression of activated Cdc42"
https://openalex.org/W2065540551,"Keap1 is a BTB-Kelch-type substrate adaptor protein of the Cul3-dependent ubiquitin ligase complex. Keap1 facilitates the degradation of Nrf2, a transcription factor regulating the inducible expression of many cytoprotective genes. Through comparative genome analyses, we found that amino acid residues composing the pocket of Keap1 that interacts with Nrf2 are highly conserved among Keap1 orthologs and related proteins in all vertebrates and in certain invertebrates, including flies and mosquitoes. The interaction between Nrf2 and Keap1 appears to be widely preserved in vertebrates. Similarly, cysteine residues corresponding to Cys-273 and Cys-288 in the intervening region of mouse Keap1, which are essential for the repression of Nrf2 activity in cultured cells, are conserved among Keap1 orthologs in vertebrates and invertebrates, except fish. We found that fish have two types of Keap1, Keap1a and Keap1b. To our surprise, Keap1a and Keap1b contain the cysteine residue corresponding to Cys-288 and Cys-273, respectively. In our analysis of zebrafish Keap1a and Keap1b activities, both Keap1a and Keap1b were able to facilitate the degradation of Nrf2 protein and repress Nrf2-mediated target gene activation. Individual mutation of either residual cysteine residue in Keap1a and Keap1b disrupted the ability of Keap1 to repress Nrf2, indicating that the presence of either Cys-273 or Cys-288 is sufficient for fish Keap1 molecules to fully function. These results provide an important insight into the means by which Keap1 cysteines act as sensors of electrophiles and oxidants.

The transcription factor Nrf2 induces the expression of phase 2 detoxifying and antioxidant proteins in response to electrophilic insults (1Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2006; 46: 113-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). These induced proteins contribute to the prevention of oxidative damage and chemically induced cancer in animals. The importance of Nrf2 in this induction and the resulting chemoprevention has been demonstrated by a number of experiments using Nrf2-deficient mice (2Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). The electrophile response is regulated through a cis-acting element called the antioxidant- or electrophile-responsive element within the regulatory region of each gene (3Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Nrf2 binds to the antioxidant/electrophile-responsive element sequence as a heterodimeric complex with small Maf proteins through a basic region leucine zipper domain (4Katsuoka F. Motohashi H. Ishii T. Aburatani H. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8044-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Under normal homeostatic conditions, Nrf2 protein is targeted for proteasomal degradation and has a short half-life. This degradation is positively controlled by Keap1, a member of the BTB (Broad complex/Tramtrack/Bric-a-brac)-Kelch protein family (5Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D.

Harada T. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Keap1 binds to Nrf2 and promotes its degradation as a substrate-specific adaptor protein for the Cul3 ubiquitin ligase complex (7Kobayashi A. Kang M.I. Okawa H. Ohtsuji M. Zenke Y. Chiba T. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7130-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). When oxidative/electrophilic stress signals disrupt the Nrf2-Keap1-Cul3 complex, ubiquitination of Nrf2 is blocked, and Nrf2 becomes stable (8Kobayashi A. Kang M.I. Watai Y. Tong K.I. Shibata T. Uchida K. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Consequently, the expression of a battery of cytoprotective genes is induced as Nrf2 accumulates in the nucleus. Keap1 is composed of three major domains: a BTB domain, a double glycine repeat (DGR) 2The abbreviations used are: DGRdouble glycine repeatIVRintervening regionGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutininRTreverse transcriptionICIVR cysteine. domain, and an intervening region (IVR) domain (1Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2006; 46: 113-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). The BTB domain functions to dimerize Keap1 (9Zipper L.M. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36544-36552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), whereas the DGR domain serves as a binding site for Nrf2 (5Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar) and actin (10Kang M.I. Kobayashi A. Wakabayashi N. Kim S.G. Yamamoto M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 689-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) and Hannink and co-workers (12Lo S.C. Li X. Henzl M.T. Beamer L.J. Hannink M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3605-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) have determined the crystal structure of the Keap1 DGR domain and identified its interface with Nrf2. Involvement of the Keap1 IVR domain in the ubiquitination of Nrf2 has been demonstrated (8Kobayashi A. Kang M.I. Watai Y. Tong K.I. Shibata T. Uchida K. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 13Zhang D.D. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8137-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). In cultured cells, mutation of Cys-273 or Cys-288 in the IVR domain to alanine or serine reduces Keap1-dependent ubiquitination and increases Nrf2 stability, suggesting that these residues are crucial for the Nrf2-repressing activity of Keap1 (13Zhang D.D.

We previously isolated homolog genes of Nrf2 and Keap1 in zebrafish and established that the Nrf2-dependent induction of cytoprotective genes is conserved among vertebrates (16Kobayashi M. Itoh K. Suzuki T. Osanai H. Nishikawa K. Katoh Y. Takagi Y. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 17Takagi Y. Kobayashi M. Li L. Suzuki T. Nishikawa K. Yamamoto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We thus speculated that the Nrf2-Keap1 system of cytoprotection is also conserved in vertebrates. To our surprise, zebrafish Keap1 protein does not contain a cysteine residue corresponding to Cys-273 in mouse Keap1, yet it still represses the activity of Nrf2 in zebrafish embryos (16Kobayashi M. Itoh K. Suzuki T. Osanai H. Nishikawa K. Katoh Y. Takagi Y. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In this work, we compared the amino acid sequences of the Keap1-related proteins of various vertebrates and invertebrates by comparative genome analysis. Critical amino acids in the Nrf2-interacting surface of the DGR domain are highly conserved among these proteins, but are completely different in other mouse BTB-Kelch proteins. This indicates that Keap1 is the only BTB-Kelch protein that regulates Nrf2 activity and also implies the presence of the Nrf2-Keap1 system in invertebrates. Interestingly, fish have two Keap1 genes, which we refer to as Keap1a and Keap1b. Keap1a has a cysteine residue corresponding to Cys-273, but not to Cys-288, in mouse Keap1, whereas the case is the reverse for Keap1b. We analyzed the activities of zebrafish Keap1a and Keap1b using zebrafish embryos and demonstrated that either protein can promote Nrf2 degradation; both Cys-273 and Cys-288 are important for Keap1 activity, but either one is enough in fish. Isolation of cDNAA partial cDNA fragment encoding zebrafish Keap1b was prepared by PCR using specific primers designed based on genomic DNA information. A λZAP-II 15–19-h-stage cDNA library (18Appel B. Eisen J.S. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 371-380PubMed Google Scholar) was screened to isolate a full-length Keap1b cDNA clone using the partial cDNA clone as a probe. The probe was labeled using an AlkPhos Direct DNA labeling kit, and positive plaques on the membrane filters were detected with CDP-Star as substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). Radiation Hybrid MappingRadiation hybrid mapping using panel LN54 was performed as described by Hukriede et al. (19Hukriede N. Fisher D. Epstein J. Joly L. Tellis P. Zhou Y. Barbazuk B. Cox K. Fenton-Noriega L. Hersey C. Miles J. Sheng X. Song A. Waterman R. Johnson S.L. Dawid I.B. Chevrette M. Zon L.I. McPherson J. Ekker M. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 2127-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using specific primers for each Keap1 gene. The sequences of each primer were as follows: keap1a, 5′-AGGATTTCTCCGCCATTGTG and 5′-CCTTGAAGTTGCTGGTGAAC; and keap1b, 5′-ATGACGGAGTGTAAGGCGG and 5′-CAGGCCGTTGGTGAACATG. Plasmid ConstructionThe plasmid pCS2keap1b was constructed by subcloning the open reading frame of zebrafish keap1b into the BamHI and XbaI sites of the vector pCS2. To construct pSPkeap1aC, cDNA encoding the C-terminal region (amino acids 353–601) containing the 3′-untranslated region of zebrafish keap1a was inserted into the NotI and SalI sites of the vector pSPORT1. The plasmid pKSkeap1bN was generated by inserting cDNA encoding the N-terminal region (amino acids 8–188) of keap1b into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pBluescript II KS. To construct pCS2nrf2NTnGFP, cDNA encoding the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–305) of zebrafish nrf2 plus two repeats of SV40 nuclear localizing signal (DPKKKRKV) were subcloned into the BamHI site of pCS2eGFP. The cDNA fragments for 3×FLAG tag (MDYKDHDGDYKDHDIDYKDDDDK) and 3×hemagglutinin (HA) tag (MEYPYDVPDYAAEYPYDVPDYAAEYPYDVPDYAAKLE) were subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pCS2 to generate pCS2FL and pCS2HA, respectively. The plasmids pCS2FLkeap1a, pCS2FLkeap1b, and pCS2FLnrf2 were constructed by inserting the open reading frames of keap1a, keap1b, and nrf2, respectively, into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pCS2FL. pCS2HAkeap1a and pCS2HAkeap1b were prepared by inserting the open reading frames of keap1a and keap1b, respectively, into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pCS2HA. The constructs pCS2FLkeap1aC264S and pCS2FLkeap1bC247S were made by introducing Cys-to-Ser point mutations by PCR into pCS2FLkeap1a and pCS2FLkeap1b, respectively. pKSgstp1N was constructed by subcloning the cDNA for the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–135) of gstp1 into the BamHI and SalI sites of pBluescript II KS. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids pCS2nrf2, pCS2keap1a (previously named pCS2Keap1), and pCS2eGFP were described previously (17Takagi Y. Kobayashi M. Li L. Suzuki T. Nishikawa K. Yamamoto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Kobayashi M. Nishikawa K. Yamamoto M. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 2341-2350PubMed Google Scholar). Expression AnalysisZebrafish embryos and larvae were obtained by natural mating. All experiments were carried out using a wild-type AB strain. The expression of keap1a, keap1b, and gstp1 genes was analyzed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and whole mount in situ hybridization. For RT-PCR analysis, total RNA was prepared from adult tissues or the whole bodies of embryos and larvae using QIAzol (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized by incubation at 25 °C for 15 min and at 42 °C for 45 min with murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II, Invitrogen) and random hexamer oligonucleotide primers. From the 20-μl first-strand reaction, 0.025–0.1 was used for PCR using the following primers: keap1a, 5′-ATGATATGTCCAAGAAAGAAG and 5′-TCATGAGGAAATCGCAGCAG; keap1b, 5′-ACGGAGTGTAAGGCGGAG and 5′-ACCTGGCTGAAGTTCATG; gstp1, 5′-CTAGGAGCAGCTTTGAAACGCAC and 5′-TGGCCAGAACATTTTCAAAGC; and ef1α, 5′-GCCCCTGCCAATGTA and 5′-GGGCTTGCCAGGGAC. The expression of ef1α was used to standardize the amount of cDNA. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to quantitate gstp1 expression using an ABI Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems) and probes labeled with a reporter fluorescent dye (TaqMan probe) as described previously (21Onodera K. Shavit J.A. Motohashi H. Katsuoka F. Akasaka J.E. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21162-21169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). TaqMan probes, primers, and cDNAs were added to the master mixture containing the reagents for PCR (Eurogentec). The sequences of the specific primers and probes were as follows: gstp1, 5′-CAACGCCATGCTGAGACATC (sense), 5′-GAAGATCTTCAACGCCGTCG (antisense), and 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein-AACATGCTGCATATGGCAAAAACGACAGT-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (probe); and ef1α, 5′-CGTGGTAATGTGGCTGGAGA (sense), 5′-CTGAGCGTTGAAGTTGGCAG (antisense), and 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein-AGCAAGAACGACCCACCCATGGAG-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (probe). Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (22Kobayashi M. Nishikawa K. Suzuki T. Yamamoto M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 232: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) using RNA probes transcribed from pSPkeap1a, pKSkeap1b, and pKSgstp1N. Microinjection of Zebrafish EmbryosSynthetic capped RNA was made with an SP6 mMESSAGE mMACHINE in vitro transcription kit (Ambion) using linearized DNA of the pCS2 derivatives described above. For expression in whole bodies, RNA was injected into yolk at the one-cell stage using an IM300 microinjector (Narishige). GFP expression was examined under the GFP Plus filter (480 nm excitation, 505 nm emission) of a MZFLIII microscope (Leica) equipped with a 600CL-CU digital camera (Pixera). In Vitro Translation and Co-immunoprecipitationHA- and FLAG-tagged Keap1 proteins were in vitro translated separately by TnT coupled wheat germ extract systems (Promega) using pCS2 derivatives as DNA templates. In vitro translated Keap1 proteins were mixed in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and incubated with an affinity matrix-immobilized anti-HA antibody (3F10, Roche Diagnostics) at 4 °C for 4 h with gentle mixing on a rotator. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 12,500 × g for 5 s and washed three times in binding buffer. Precipitated proteins were eluted in SDS-sample buffer and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting using anti-HA (12CA5, Roche Diagnostics) and anti-FLAG (M2, peroxidase conjugate, Sigma) antibodies as described previously (22Kobayashi M. Nishikawa K. Suzuki T. Yamamoto M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 232: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Identification of the Second Keap1 in ZebrafishBy virtue of recent progress in the zebrafish genome project, we came across a novel Keap1-related gene that shows a higher similarity to mammalian Keap1 than previously reported zebrafish Keap1 (16Kobayashi M. Itoh K. Suzuki T. Osanai H. Nishikawa K. Katoh Y. Takagi Y. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). A partial cDNA was isolated by RT-PCR using specific primers whose design was based on genomic DNA information. We screened a zebrafish cDNA λ-phage library using this partial cDNA as a probe and isolated a full-length cDNA clone. We refer to this gene as keap1b, and the previous keap1 was renamed keap1a. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Keap1b cDNA product showed 81 and 78% identities to the BTB and DGR domains, respectively, of mouse Keap1 protein (Fig. 1A). These values are quite high compared with those of Keap1a, whose identities to the BTB and DGR domains are only 49 and 55%, respectively. We mapped both Keap1 genes using an LN54 hybrid panel (19Hukriede N. Fisher D. Epstein J. Joly L. Tellis P. Zhou Y. Barbazuk B. Cox K. Fenton-Noriega L. Hersey C. Miles J. Sheng X. Song A.

Genome Res. 2001; 11: 2127-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and found that keap1a and keap1b are localized on zebrafish chromosomes 2 and 6, respectively. The latest information from the zebrafish genome project supported these mapped sites and further demonstrated that synteny was found between keap1b and the human KEAP1 locus on chromosome 19p13.2 (supplemental Fig. 1). Neh2 is the domain in Nrf2 that interacts with the DGR domain in Keap1 (5Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar). Within the Neh2 domain, we found that the motifs ETGE and DLG are critical for the interaction with Keap1 (16Kobayashi M. Itoh K. Suzuki T. Osanai H. Nishikawa K. Katoh Y. Takagi Y. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 23Katoh Y. Iida K. Kang M.I. Kobayashi A. Mizukami M. Tong K.I. McMahon M. Hayes J.D. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified the region of the Keap1 DGR domain responsible for binding to the ETGE and DLG motifs by structural analysis of the mouse Keap1 protein (11Padmanabhan B. Tong K.I. Ohta T.

Padmanabhan B. Kobayashi A. Shang C. Hirotsu Y. Yokoyama S. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7511-7521Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The amino acid residues important for binding to the ETGE motif have been recognized as Ser-363, Arg-380, Asn-382, Arg-415, Arg-483, Ser-508, Tyr-525, Gln-530, Ser-555, and Ser-602. Those important for binding to the DLG motif are Asn-382, Arg-415, Arg-483, Ser-508, Ser-555, Tyr-572, Phe-577, Ser-602, and Gly-603 (Fig. 1B, white characters highlighted in black). Mutation analyses of mouse and human Keap1 proteins have demonstrated that Tyr-334, Gly-364, Gly-430, His-436, and Phe-478 (Fig. 1B, white characters highlighted in gray), in addition to Arg-380, Asn-382, Arg-415, Arg-483, Tyr-525, and Tyr-572, are critical for inhibiting Nrf2 activity (11Padmanabhan B.

Interestingly, all these residues, except Asn-382 and Tyr-572, are conserved in both zebrafish Keap1a and Keap1b, suggesting that both proteins can interact with Nrf2. Indeed, zebrafish Keap1a has been shown to interact with Nrf2 and to inhibit its activity (16Kobayashi M. Itoh K. Suzuki T. Osanai H. Nishikawa K. Katoh Y. Takagi Y. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Although Mayven is the protein with the highest homology to Keap1 in the DGR domain among mouse BTB-Kelch proteins (25Prag S. Adams J.C. BMC Bioinformatics. 2003; 4: 42Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), it possesses only 2 of the 13 critical Nrf2-interacting residues in mouse Keap1 (Fig. 1B, mm). This case is similar to that of KLHL20 and KLHL5, two other Keap1-related proteins (supplemental Table 1). These results suggest that the activity of Nrf2 is regulated by two Keap1 proteins, Keap1a and Keap1b, in zebrafish and by a single Keap1 protein in mouse, which may be the only BTB-Kelch protein that can facilitate Nrf2 degradation. Here, we propose to define Keap1 as a BTB-Kelch protein carrying the evolutionarily conserved Nrf2-interacting surface. Unlike Keap1, we could not find a second Nrf2 gene in the zebrafish genome data base. Nrf2 is a member of the CNC (Cap `n' collar) protein family, whose members are NF-E2 p45, Nrf1, Nrf2, Nrf3, Bach1, and Bach2 (1Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2006; 46: 113-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Among them, genetic loci of mammalian NF-E2 p45, Nrf1, Nrf2, and Nrf3 genes have been mapped close to those of HoxC, HoxB, HoxD, and HoxA, respectively (34Kobayashi A. Ito E. Toki T. Kogame K. Takahashi S. Igarashi K. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6443-6452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the zebrafish genome has two copies of HoxA, HoxB, and HoxC clusters, but only one HoxD cluster (35Amores A. Force A. Yan Y.L. Joly L. Amemiya C. Fritz A. Ho R.K. Langeland J. Prince V. Wang Y.L. Westerfield M. Ekker M. Postlethwait J.H. Science. 1998; 282: 1711-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). We assume that the second Nrf2 gene in zebrafish had been lost together with the second HoxD cluster during evolution. Keap1 Is Present in Vertebrates and in Some InvertebratesTo identify the range of species in which Keap1 is present, we searched the Ensemble and DDBJ/GenBank™/EBI Data Bank for Keap1-related proteins. As well as in mammals, Keap1 genes were found in chicken, frogs (Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis), fugu, Tetraodon nigroviridis, medaka fish, stickleback, ascidians (Ciona intestinalis and Ciona savignyi), mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae), and Drosophila. A phylogenetic tree based on the amino acid sequences of their DGR domains classified the Keap1 proteins into five subgroups: 1) vertebrate Keap1, 2) fish Keap1a, 3) fish Keap1b, 4) ascidian Keap1, and 5) invertebrate Keap1 (Fig. 1C). No Keap1-related genes were found in nematode or yeast. We noted that all these Keap1 proteins carry 13 critical Nrf2-interacting residues, with the exceptions of Asn-382 and Tyr-572 for fish Keap1a and Tyr-525 for invertebrate Keap1 (supplemental Table 1). The results suggest that Keap1 regulates Nrf2 or related proteins in these organisms in a manner similar to that in mammals. Keap1a and Keap1b are conserved among fish, but not in other vertebrates, signifying that both proteins are essential to the fish Nrf2-Keap1 system. Keap1b rather than Keap1a may represent the ortholog of vertebrate Keap1 because conserved synteny was observed between human KEAP1 and fish keap1b loci (supplemental Fig. 1). No synteny was found between human Keap1 and fish Keap1a genes or with ascidian or invertebrate Keap1. This implies that Keap1b may be the proper homolog of vertebrate Keap1. Keap1a and Keap1b Repress Nrf2 Activity Despite Their Lack of a Cysteine Residue Corresponding to Mouse Keap1 Cys-273 and Cys-288, RespectivelyAll fish Keap1a and Keap1b lack a cysteine residue corresponding to Cys-273 and Cys-288, respectively, whereas both these cysteines are conserved even in ascidian and invertebrate Keap1 proteins (Fig. 2). This finding was surprising because both Cys-273 and Cys-288 in the IVR were demonstrated to be crucial for the Nrf2-repressing activity of mouse Keap1 (13Zhang D.D. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8137-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar, 14Levonen A.L. Landar A. Ramachandran A. Ceaser E.K. Dickinson D.A. Zanoni G. Morrow J.D. Darley-Usmar V.M. Biochem.

To elucidate whether zebrafish Keap1a and Keap1b can repress the inducible function of Nrf2, we tested the extent of their repression on the Nrf2-mediated inducible expression of the endogenous gstp1 gene in zebrafish embryos. The gstp1 gene encodes a Pi class glutathione S-transferase and is strongly induced in both electrophile-treated larvae and Nrf2-overexpressing embryos (16Kobayashi M. Itoh K. Suzuki T. Osanai H. Nishikawa K. Katoh Y. Takagi Y. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 26Suzuki T. Takagi Y. Osanai H. Li L. Takeuchi M. Katoh Y. Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Its promoter contains an evolutionarily conserved antioxidant/electrophile-responsive element sequence that is critical for both Nrf2 binding and promoter activity (26Suzuki T. Takagi Y. Osanai H. Li L. Takeuchi M. Katoh Y. Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In vitro synthesized zebrafish Keap1a or Keap1b mRNA (200 pg) was co-injected with Nrf2 mRNA (100 pg) into zebrafish embryos at the one-cell stage (Fig. 3A). At midgastrula, gstp1 expression was analyzed by whole mount in situ hybridization analysis. Nrf2-induced expression of gstp1 was reduced by co-overexpression of either Keap1a or Keap1b (Fig. 3B), indicating that both Keap1a and Keap1b possess the ability to repress Nrf2 activity. To confirm this, we used FLAG-tagged Keap1 proteins to standardize the protein expression level of each Keap1 by immunoblotting (supplemental Fig. 2). Seventy-five pg of Keap1a mRNA and 200 pg of Keap1b mRNA expressed similar amounts of Keap1 proteins in zebrafish embryos. Only full-length proteins were overexpressed in embryos. The FLAG-tagged constructs were used to compare the Nrf2 repression activity of Keap1a and Keap1b by real-time RT-PCR analyses (Fig. 3C). Sixty pg of Nrf2 mRNA were co-injected with various amounts of Keap1a or Keap1b mRNA (Fig. 3C). The dose effects of Keap1 mRNA on Nrf2 repression were similar between Keap1a and Keap1b, suggesting that the activities of Keap1a and Keap1b to repress Nrf2 activity are comparable, at least in zebrafish embryos.FIGURE 3Effects of Keap1a and Keap1b on Nrf2-mediated gstp1 induction. A, experimental scheme. Nrf2 and/or Keap1 mRNA was co-injected into embryos at the one-cell stage. After 8 h, gstp1 expression in embryos was analyzed by whole mount in situ hybridization (B) or by real-time RT-PCR (C). C, in real-time RT-PCR analysis, FLAG-tagged (FL) Keap1 proteins were used instead of non-tagged proteins. The expression levels of gstp1 were normalized to those of ef1α measured in the same cDNA preparations. Values for the Nrf2-overexpressing embryos were arbitrarily set at 100. The amounts of injected mRNA were 0.12, 0.6, 3, 15, and 75 pg for Keap1a and 0.32, 1.6, 8, 40, and 200 pg for Keap1b.

https://openalex.org/W2093216727,"Abstract It has recently been realized that animal cryptochromes (CRYs) fall into two broad groups. Type 1 CRYs, the prototype of which is the Drosophila CRY, that is known to be a circadian photoreceptor. Type 2 CRYs, the prototypes of which are human CRY 1 and CRY 2, are known to function as core clock proteins. The mechanism of photosignaling by the Type 1 CRYs is not well understood. We recently reported that the flavin cofactor of the Type 1 CRY of the monarch butterfly may be in the form of flavin anion radical, , in vivo. Here we describe the purification and characterization of wild-type and mutant forms of Type 1 CRYs from fruit fly, butterfly, mosquito, and silk moth. Cryptochromes from all four sources contain FADox when purified, and the flavin is readily reduced to by light. Interestingly, mutations that block photoreduction in vitro do not affect the photoreceptor activities of these CRYs, but mutations that reduce the stability of in vitro abolish the photoreceptor function of Type 1 CRYs in vivo. Collectively, our data provide strong evidence for functional similarities of Type 1 CRYs across insect species and further support the proposal that represents the ground state and not the excited state of the flavin cofactor in Type 1 CRYs."
https://openalex.org/W2155703790,"Hel308 is a superfamily 2 helicase conserved in eukaryotes and archaea. It is thought to function in the early stages of recombination following replication fork arrest and has a specificity for removal of the lagging strand in model replication forks. A homologous helicase constitutes the N-terminal domain of human DNA polymerase Q. The Drosophila homologue mus301 is implicated in double strand break repair and meiotic recombination. We have solved the high resolution crystal structure of Hel308 from the crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, revealing a five-domain structure with a central pore lined with essential DNA binding residues. The fifth domain is shown to act as an autoinhibitory domain or molecular brake, clamping the single-stranded DNA extruded through the central pore of the helicase structure to limit the helicase activity of the enzyme. This provides an elegant mechanism to tune the processivity of the enzyme to its functional role. Hel308 can displace streptavidin from a biotinylated DNA molecule, and this activity is only partially inhibited when the DNA is pre-bound with abundant DNA-binding proteins RPA or Alba1, whereas pre-binding with the recombinase RadA has no effect on activity. These data suggest that one function of the enzyme may be in the removal of bound proteins at stalled replication forks and recombination intermediates."

https://openalex.org/W2060837796,"The adaptor molecule MyD88 is necessary for responses to all Toll-like receptors except TLR3 and a subset of TLR4 signaling events, which are mediated by the adaptor molecule TRIF. To determine the role of TRIF in host inflammatory responses, corneal epithelium of C57BL/6, TLR3-/-, TRIF-/-, and MyD88-/- mice was abraded and stimulated with the synthetic TLR3 ligand poly(I:C). We found that poly(I:C) induced a pronounced cellular infiltration into the corneal stroma, which was TLR3- and TRIF-dependent. Unexpectedly, the inflammatory response was exacerbated in MyD88-/- mice, with enhanced neutrophil and F4/80+ cell infiltration into the corneal stroma and elevated corneal haze, which is an indicator of loss of corneal transparency. To determine whether MyD88-dependent inhibition of TLR3/TRIF responses is a general phenomenon, we examined cytokine production by MyD88-/- bone marrow-derived macrophages; however, no significant difference was observed between MyD88+/+ or MyD88-/- macrophages. Incontrast, human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) transfected with MyD88 small interfering RNA had significantly increased (2.5-fold) CCL5/RANTES production compared with control HCECs, demonstrating a negative regulatory role for MyD88 in TLR3/TRIF responses in these cells. Finally, knockdown of MyD88 in HCECs resulted in increased phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not p38, IRF-3, or NF-κB. Consistent with this finding, the JNK inhibitor SP600125, but not p38 inhibitor SB203580, ablated this response.

Upon recognition of a specific pathogenic ligand, signaling cascades are activated through several adaptor molecules, which are thought to determine the specificity of the response (1Kawai T.

Furthermore, the adaptor molecule responsible for MyD88-independent responses is the TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-β (TRIF) (2West A.P. Koblansky A.A. Ghosh S. Annu. Rev.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). TLRs are expressed on both myeloid and nonmyeloid cells, including epithelial cells (1Kawai T. Akira S. Semin.

Corneal epithelial cells are located at the ocular surface, and in addition to providing a physical barrier function, they also mediate the immune response to microbial products through the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides (9Hazlett L.D.

Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Examination of Stromal Thickness and Haze by in Vivo Confocal Microscopy–Analysis of inflammation in the mouse cornea was assessed using a Nidek Confoscan™, as described previously (22Johnson A.C. Heinzel F.P. Diaconu E. Sun Y. Hise A.G. Golenbock D. Lass J.H. Pearlman E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Mice were euthanized with CO2 and immobilized on a secure platform. A 40× objective was directed toward the corneal surface, using transparent Genteal gel (Novartis Ophthalmics, Duluth, GA) as a medium between the corneal surface and the objective. NAVIS™ software captured images every 5 μm and stored them as a stack for analysis of stromal haze, defined as the stromal thickness × combined light intensity of each image of the corneal stroma. To obtain a numerical value for stromal haze, the series of intensity values for each corneal stroma was saved in Microsoft Excel and exported into Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) to generate a curve using the “curves and regression” function. The total area under the curve was then calculated using this software. Base-line measurements in each experiment were determined using naïve, untreated mice. Isolation and Culture of Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages–L929 fibroblast conditioned media, which is enriched in macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, was kindly provided by Fred P. Heinzel, and bone marrow-derived macrophages were derived as previously described (26Celada A. Gray P.W. Rinderknecht E. Schreiber R.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 55-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Bone marrow cells were harvested from the femurs and tibia of four to six C57BL/6, TLR2-/-, TLR3-/-, TRIF-/-, MyD88+/+, and MyD88-/- mice. The bones were trimmed at each end and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 30 s, and bone marrow cells were suspended in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS, and 30% L929 conditioned medium) and plated in six-well plates. 24 h later nonadherent cells were collected (leaving behind fibroblasts that were present in the preparation) and placed into new tissue culture dishes. Macrophage precursors were then expanded for 72 h. Finally, nonadherent and semi-adherent cells were transferred into 96-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells/well. The cells were treated with either poly(I:C) or Pam3Cys at the indicated doses for 24 h. Epithelial Cell Culture and Reagents–The SV-40 immortalized human corneal epithelial cell line (HCEC, 10.014 pRSV-T; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was maintained in culture with keratinocyte serum-free medium supplemented with bovine pituitary extract and human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Generally, the cells were placed in keratinocyte serum-free medium lacking EGF 24 h prior to experimental manipulation and once they had reached 70–80% confluency. Cells were then treated with either poly(I:C) or Pam3Cys at specified concentrations in keratinocyte serum-free medium, and culture supernatants were collected 24 h after treatment. Chemokine Analysis–Bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages and HCECs were treated as described above. At the conclusion of the experiments, the supernatants were collected, and secreted chemokine levels (mCXCL1/KC, mCXCL2/MIP-2, mCCL5/RANTES, mCXCL10/IP-10, hCXCL8/IL-8, hCCL5/RANTES, and hCXCL10/IP-10) were assayed by sandwich ELISA according to the manufacturer's directions (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The limit of detection of the assays was 15 pg/ml. Western Blot Analysis–HCECs were washed with ice-cold 0.01 m PBS (pH 7.4) (Sigma), and cell lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm SDS, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA) was added to the culture dishes. These were then scraped, and the lysates were homogenized using the Mixer Mill 300 (Qiagen). The protein concentration of the samples was then determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Equivalent amounts of protein samples were then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, washed, and incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in 5% bovine serum albumin and 5% PBS-Tween 20 and include the following: rabbit anti-human MyD88, rabbit anti-human phospho-IRF-3, rabbit anti-human phospho-IκBα, rabbit anti-human phospho-SAPK/JNK, and mouse anti-human phospho-p38 MAP kinase antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). The secondary antibody used for these stains was anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Loading controls were determined using goat anti-human actin diluted 1:2000 in 5% milk and 5% PBS-Tween 20. The secondary antibody for this control was anti-goat horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Finally, the blots were visualized with ECL Western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare). RNA Interference Knockdown in Vitro–RNA interference was achieved using siRNAs targeted against human MyD88 or TRIF. Nontargeting scrambled RNA was also included to control for nonspecific effects of the siRNA on the cells. All siRNAs were reconstituted to a stock concentration of 20 μm according to the manufacturer's directions (Dharmacon RNA Technologies, Lafayette, CO). Cells were washed twice with 0.01 m PBS (pH 7.4) (Sigma); 50 nm siRNA was first diluted in Opti-MEM® I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen); and Lipofectamine™ 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) was diluted in Opti-MEM® I medium with reduced serum. The siRNA and transfection reagent were then mixed together to form liposomes containing siRNAs. These complexes were added to the HCECs for 6 h, the transfection reagents were removed, and the cells were placed into normal culture medium (described above). Inhibition of Cell Signaling Components–Inhibition of JNK and p38 MAP kinase signaling was achieved by using SP600125 and SB203580, respectively (Calbiochem). Briefly, the HCECs were transfected as described above. 30 min prior to 24-h treatment of the cells with TLR agonists, the medium was changed, and either SP600125 (25 μm) or SB203580 (10 μm) was added to the cells. Me2SO was included as a negative control for the inhibitors because they are dissolved in this chemical. Statistics–Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired t test (Prism; GraphPad Software). p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Poly(I:C)-induced Corneal Inflammation Is Ablated in TLR3-/- and TRIF-/- Mice–Because double-stranded RNA activates receptors other than TLR3 (27Lee M.S. Kim Y.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 447-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 28Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat.

A. 2004; 101: 17264-17269Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), we first examined whether poly(I:C)-induced corneal inflammation is mediated by TLR3/TRIF signaling. Therefore, a 1-mm2-diameter area of the corneal epithelium of C57BL/6, TLR3-/-, and TRIF-/- mice was abraded and stimulated with the TLR3 agonist poly(I: C). At set time points, the mice were euthanized, and their eyes were snap frozen. The cellular infiltration in the corneal stroma was determined after F4/80 staining and direct counting of 5 μm corneal sections. Because our preliminary studies indicated that maximal F4/80+ cellular infiltration occurred after 72 h (data not shown), Fig. 1 shows results at this time point. Fig. 1A demonstrates that poly(I:C)-stimulated corneas had elevated F4/80+ cells (which includes macrophages and dendritic cells (23McKnight A.J. Macfarlane A.J. Dri P. Turley L. Willis A.C.

Shortman K. Wright M.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3570-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)) in the corneal stroma of C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, there was no significant influx of cells above saline-injected controls (hatched line) in TLR3-/- and TRIF-/- mice. Furthermore, TLR2 activation using Pam3Cys did not result in any significant differences among C57BL/6, TLR3-/-, or TRIF-/- mice, indicating that these gene knockout mice respond normally to other TLR ligands (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these data clearly demonstrate that TLR3 and TRIF are functional in the cornea and that poly(I:C)-induced F4/80+ cellular infiltration to the corneal stroma is dependent on TLR3 and TRIF. TLR3/TRIF-induced Corneal Inflammation Is Exacerbated in MyD88-/- Mice–Our previous work demonstrated that MyD88 plays a critical role in corneal inflammation induced by TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 (22Johnson A.C. Heinzel F.P. Diaconu E. Sun Y. Hise A.G. Golenbock D. Lass J.H. Pearlman E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because TLR3 signaling is MyD88-independent (5Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 30Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of poly(I: C)-induced inflammation in the absence of MyD88 as an additional control group. MyD88+/+ and MyD88-/- corneas were treated as described above, and after 72 h, the eyes were sectioned and immunostained for either F4/80+ or NIMP+ (neutrophils) cells. Surprisingly, we found that the response in poly(I:C)-treated MyD88-/- corneas was exacerbated compared with littermate controls (Fig. 2). Specifically, MyD88-/- mice had significantly increased F4/80+ cells, and although there were no NIMP+ in TLR3-stimulated MyD88+/+ littermate or C57BL/6 corneas (data not shown), poly(I:C)-treated MyD88-/- mice had a pronounced neutrophil infiltrate in the corneal stroma compared with littermate controls. As a positive control, MyD88+/+ and MyD88-/- corneas were treated with the TLR2 agonist Pam3Cys, and as previously demonstrated (22Johnson A.C. Heinzel F.P. Diaconu E. Sun Y. Hise A.G. Golenbock D. Lass J.H. Pearlman E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), corneal inflammation was ablated in MyD88-/- mice. Taken together, we conclude that MyD88 has an inhibitory effect on TLR3/TRIF-induced F4/80+ cell and neutrophil recruitment into the corneal stroma. To determine the effect of MyD88 on TLR3/TRIF-induced corneal haze, MyD88-/- and littermate corneas were stimulated with poly(I:C), and corneal stromal haze, which is an inverse measure of corneal transparency, was measured by in vivo confocal microscopy. Confoscan™ images of the central corneal stroma of wild type and MyD88-/- mice 72 h after treatment with either saline control or poly(I:C) are shown in Fig. 3A. An intense cellular infiltrate was visible only in MyD88-/- mice treated with poly(I:C). Corneal haze was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the results are shown in Fig. 3B. We found that TLR3/TRIF-induced stromal haze was significantly elevated in MyD88-/- mice compared with littermate control animals, which is consistent with elevated F4/80+ and NIMP+ cellular infiltrates described in Fig. 2. No inflammation was observed in saline-injected controls (hatched lines). These findings demonstrate that MyD88 has a negative regulatory effect on TLR3/TRIF-induced F4/80+ cell and neutrophil recruitment to the corneal stroma and in the development of corneal haze, which together comprise the inflammatory response in the cornea. MyD88 Has No Effect on TLR3/TRIF-activated Macrophages–Because there are resident macrophages in the normal corneal stroma (31Brissette-Storkus C.S. Reynolds S.M. Lepisto A.J. Hendricks R.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 2264-2271PubMed Google Scholar) and to determine whether the down-regulatory role of MyD88 on TLR3/TRIF responses is a more generalized phenomenon, we examined the response of MyD88-/- bone marrow macrophages to poly(I:C). Bone marrow cells were collected from C57BL/6 and TRIF-/- mice and from MyD88-/- and wild type littermates, and macrophage precursors were expanded in culture as described (26Celada A. Gray P.W. Rinderknecht E. Schreiber R.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 55-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Macrophages were then stimulated with either poly(I:C) or Pam3Cys, and cytokine production was measured by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 4A, CCL5/RANTES and CXCL10/IP-10 were increased in C57BL/6 and MyD88-/- macrophages stimulated with poly(I:C), with no significant differences between the groups. CXCL1/KC and CXCL2/MIP-2 were not produced in response to TLR3/TRIF stimulation for either group of mice, consistent with previous reports that these are MyD88-dependent chemokines (22Johnson A.C. Heinzel F.P. Diaconu E. Sun Y. Hise A.G. Golenbock D. Lass J.H. Pearlman E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In contrast, TLR2 induced CXCL1/KC, CXCL2/MIP-2, CCL5/RANTES, and CXCL10/IP-10 production, which was completely dependent on MyD88 as reported (1Kawai T. Akira S. Semin. Immunol. 2007; 19: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). As further controls for TLR3 and TLR2 activation of macrophages, bone marrow-derived macrophages from C57BL/6 and TRIF-/- mice were stimulated with either poly(I:C) or Pam3Cys, and chemokines were measured. Fig. 4B demonstrates that poly(I:C)-activated TRIF-/- macrophages produced significantly less CCL5/RANTES and CXCL10/IP-10, and poly(I:C) did not induce production of either CXCL1/KC or CXCL2/MIP2. Furthermore, Pam3Cys stimulated production of all four chemokines, and no significant differences were observed between C57BL/6 and TRIF-/- macrophages. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that macrophages respond to TLR ligands as anticipated and indicate that the MyD88 inhibition of TLR3/TRIF responses in vivo are likely not be due to the response of resident macrophages in the cornea. MyD88-dependent Inhibition of TLR3/TRIF Responses in Human Corneal Epithelial Cells HCECs–Corneal epithelial cells are the predominant cell type at the ocular surface and can produce cytokines and β-defensins in response to TLR2 ligands and type 1 interferon in response to TLR3 ligands (9Hazlett L.D.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling plays a crucial role in promoting neuronal survival and neuroplasticity, but its role, if any, in stress-induced alterations of long term potentiation (LTP) and long term depression (LTD) is unknown. We found here that inhibitors of PI3K signaling blocked the effects of acute restraint-tail shock stress protocol on LTP and LTD. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to explore the signaling events involving PI3K in terms of its role in mediating stress protocol-induced alterations of LTP and LTD. We found that stress protocol-induced PI3K activation can be blocked by various inhibitors, including RU38486 for glucocorticoid receptors, LY294002 for PI3K, and dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid for N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors or brain-derived neurotrophic factor antisense oligonucleotides. Also, immunoblotting analyses revealed that stress protocol induced a profound and prolonged phosphorylation of numbers of PI3K downstream effectors, including 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, protein kinase B, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p70 S6 kinase, and eukaryotic initiation factor 4B in hippocampal CA1 homogenate, which was prevented by the PI3K inhibitor pretreatment. More importantly, we found that stress protocol significantly increased the protein expression of dendritic scaffolding protein PSD-95 (postsynaptic density-95), which is known to be involved in LTP and LTD, in an mTOR-dependent manner. These results identify a key role of PI3K signaling in mediating the stress protocol-induced modification of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and further suggest that PI3K may do so by invoking the protein expression of PSD-95.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a large family of intracellular signal transducers that catalyze the phosphorylation of the D-3 position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides (15Whitman M. Downes C.P. Keeler M. Keller T. Cantley L. Nature. 1988; 332: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar).

It has been proposed that stress may affect subsequent hippocampal synaptic plasticity by sharing some aspects of the same mechanisms underlying the support of LTP (4Kim J.J. Yoon K.S.

Because PI3K is critical for the expression of LTP, we hypothesized that PI3K might also play a role in mediating the effects of stress on hippocampal synaptic plasticity. In this study, we show that PI3K signaling is activated in the hippocampal CA1 region following an acute restraint-tail shock stress protocol, and its activity is required for the effects of such a stress protocol on subsequent LTP and LTD induction. Animals—Healthy adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250–300 g were used in these experiments. Animal care was consistent with the guidelines set by the Laboratory Animal Center of National Cheng Kung University. All experiments were approved by the National Cheng Kung University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee governing the participating laboratories. Animals were housed in groups of four in a vivarum with a 12-h light-dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 a.m.), 50–60% humidity, and free access to food and water. Ambient temperature was controlled at 24 °C. All experiments were conducted during the light phase of the cycle. Cannulation—Rats were cannulated as described previously (13Yang C.H. Huang C.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11029-11034Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 14Yang C.H. Huang C.C. Hsu K.S. J. Physiol. 2006; 577: 601-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), and 22-gauge cannulas were implanted bilaterally toward 1.0 mm above the stratum pyramidale of the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampi (coordinates: anterior, -4.0; lateral, ±4.0; ventral, 2.6), in accordance with the description by Paxinos and Watson (33Paxinos G. Watson C. The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998Google Scholar). The cannulas were fixed to the skull with dental cement. The animals were allowed to recover from surgery for 7 days before the experiments started. To deliver the various drugs, we used a 26-gauge infusion cannula connected by a polyethylene tube to a 5-μl microsyringe. Bilateral injections were performed using an infusion pump (CAM/100; CAM Microdialysis, Solna, Sweden). A total volume of 0.5 μl was infused into each side over 1 min, and the infusion cannula was kept in place for an additional 2 min to minimize backflow of the injectant. Only slices from animals with accurate cannula placements, as verified microscopically by the cannula tips located within the hippocampal CA1 region, were taken for electrophysiological recordings or biochemical measurements. Although infusions spread with a radius of ∼1.2–1.4 mm (as estimated by pilot experiments using a 0.5-μl solution of 4% methylene blue in saline), we made analyses from neurons within a radius 0.6–0.8 mm from the cannula tips to obtain better effects of infused drugs. We never observed any effects of cannulation itself or vehicle artificial CSF (aCSF; 10% Me2SO) injection. Stress Protocol—Animals were allowed to acclimate to the laboratory for 7 days before any experimental manipulation. Physical stress was evoked by 60 tail shocks (1 mA for 1 s, 30–90 s apart) while restrained in a Plexiglas tube, as described previously (11Kim J.J. Foy M.R. Thompson R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4750-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 13Yang C.H. Huang C.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11029-11034Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This restraint-tail shock stress protocol, adapted from the “learned helplessness” paradigm (i.e. animals are exposed to an unpredictable and uncontrollable aversive stimulus) (34Seligman M.E. Maier S.F. J. Exp. Psychol. 1967; 74: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar), has been shown previously to reliably induce behavioral (freezing immobility, piloerection, urination, and defecation) and endocrine (elevated serum corticosterone levels) signs of stress in rats (11Kim J.J. Foy M.R. Thompson R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4750-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 13Yang C.H. Huang C.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11029-11034Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Control animals remained in their home cages. Control and stressed animals did not have available food and water during the experiments. Plasma Corticosterone Assay—Blood samples were obtained from the tail before and after stress and immediately centrifuged at 1,000 × g, and plasma was separated and stored at -20 °C. Plasma corticosterone levels were determined by radioimmunoassay, as described previously (13Yang C.H. Huang C.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11029-11034Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Slice Preparation and Electrophysiology—Immediately after the stress protocol, animals were deeply anesthetized with halothane and decapitated with a guillotine, and hippocampal slices (400 μm thick) were prepared with a vibrating blade slicer (VT1000S; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The slices were placed in a humidified interface-type holding chamber of aCSF oxygenated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and kept at room temperature for at least 1 h before electrophysiological recording. For extracellular recordings, a single slice was transferred to a submersion-type recording chamber continually perfused with 30–32 °C oxygenated aCSF solution (117 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 11 mm glucose). Extracellular field potential recordings were carried out using an Axoclamp-2B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The responses were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz, digitally sampled at 5–10 kHz, and analyzed using pCLAMP software (version 8.0; Axon Instruments). The evoked postsynaptic responses were induced in CA1 stratum radiatum by stimulation (0.02 ms duration) of Schaffer collateral/commissural afferents at 0.033 Hz with a bipolar stainless steel stimulating electrode. The stimulation strength was set to elicit a response having an amplitude that was 30–40% of the maximum spike-free response. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded with a glass pipette filled with 1 m NaCl (2–3 megaohms resistance), and the fEPSP slope was measured from ∼20–70% of the rising phase using a least squares regression (13Yang C.H. Huang C.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11029-11034Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The LTP was induced by HFS at the test pulse intensity, consisting of two 1-s trains of stimuli separated by an intertrain interval of 20 s at 100 Hz. LTD was induced using a standard protocol of 900 stimuli at 1 Hz (LFS). The stimulation intensity during LFS application was the same as the test pulse intensity. Preparation of Synaptoneurosomes—Synaptoneurosome fractions were prepared as described previously (35Wells D.G. Dong X. Quinlan E.M. Huang Y.S. Bear M.F. Richter J.D. Fallon J.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9541-9548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Lee C.C. Huang C.C. Wu M.Y. Hsu K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 18543-18550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, the microdissected CA1 regions were homogenized in ice-cold Ca2+-, Mg2+-free buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, and 3 mm KAc, pH 7.4) and was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 1 min. Supernatants were passed through two 100-μm nylon mesh filters, followed by a 5-μm pore filter. The filtrate was then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min and then was gently resuspended with the same buffer at a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml. Immunohistochemistry—Animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and transcardially perfused with physiological saline and subsequently with fresh 4% paraformaldehyde with 1.5% picric acid in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (4 °C). After the perfusion, brains were removed and postfixed in the same fixative for 4 h and then transferred into 30% sucrose in 0.1 m phosphate buffer overnight. Serial free floating sections (15-μm thickness) were obtained using a sliding microtome. For immunostaining, free floating sections were incubated for 30 min with 3% H2O2 in 0.1 m phosphate buffer to remove endogenous peroxidase activity, washed in phosphate buffer three times, and then kept by blocking solution containing 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies that recognize phosphorylated Akt at Ser473 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA), MAP-2 (microtubule-associated protein-2; 1:100; Cell Signaling Technologies), or NeuN (neuron-specific nuclear protein; 1:100; Chemicon, Temecula, CA). After washing, secondary antibodies conjugated to the fluorescent markers Alexa-488 and Alexa-568 (1:400; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were applied to sections for 2 h. Sections were then washed, mounted on slides, and coverslipped with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and images were taken using an upright fluorescence microscope (BX51; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Specific staining was abolished by omission of primary antibody. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—For each experimental group, homogenates from at least three slices were pooled. The microdissected subregions were lysed in ice-cold Tris-HCl buffer solution (TBS; pH 7.4) containing a mixture of protein phosphatase and proteinase inhibitors (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 1 μm okadaic acid, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm benzamidine, 60 μg/ml aprotinin, and 60 μg/ml leupeptin) to avoid dephosphorylation and degradation of proteins and ground with a pellet pestle (Kontes Glassware, Vineland, NJ). Samples were sonicated and spun down at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was then assayed for total protein concentration using a Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay kit. Each sample was separated in 7.5 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following the transfer on nitrocellulose membranes, blots were blocked in TBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% Tween 20 for 1 h and then blotted for 2 h at room temperature with antibodies that recognize PSD-95 (1:2000; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), phosphorylated Akt at Ser473 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technologies), phosphorylated Akt at Thr308 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technologies), phosphorylated ERK1/2 MAPK (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technologies), phosphorylated PDK1 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technologies), phosphorylated mTOR (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technologies), phosphorylated p70 S6 kinase (S6K) (1:2000; Cell Signaling Technologies), or phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technologies). It was then probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h and developed using the ECL immunoblotting detection system. The immunoblots using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies were subsequently stripped and reprobed with the following antibodies: anti-Akt antibody (1:1000), anti-ERK1/2 MAPK antibody (1:1000), anti-PDK1 antibody (1:1000), anti-mTOR (1:1000), anti-p70S6K (1:500), or anti-eIF4B antibody (1:1000) that were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. Immunoprecipitation was carried out essentially as previously reported (37Huang C.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 179-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Homogenates (∼500 μg of protein) from control or 20 min after LTP induction slices were incubated with anti-NR2B antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) in TBS for 4 h at 4 °C. The antibody-protein complexes were then pelleted with protein A-Sepharose beads. The complex was isolated by centrifugation and washed three times. Proteins eluted from the beads were subjected to 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotting for anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1:2000; Cell Signaling Technologies). For sequential probing of the same membrane, the membrane was stripped of antibody and reprobed. Immunoblots were analyzed by densitometry using Bio-profil BioLight PC software. Only film exposures that were in the linear range of the ECL reaction were used for quantification analysis. Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) Immunoassay—The BDNF levels were measured with a conventional two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Charbonniere, France) (13Yang C.H. Huang C.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11029-11034Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Briefly, each hippocampus was weighted and then homogenized in 20 volumes of ice-cold lysis TBS, and the homogenates were centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. Tissue samples were acidified for 15 min and neutralized, because this treatment has been reported to aid dissociation of bound trophic factors from their receptors (38Okragly A.J. Haak-Frendscho M. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 145: 592-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). BDNF concentrations were calculated from regression analysis of human recombinant BDNF standard curve run in each assay and expressed as normalized per gram of tissue wet weight. Drugs—The sequences of BDNF antisense and sense oligonucleotides were 5′-TCTTCCCCTTTTAATGGT-3′ and 5′-ACCATTAAAAGGGGAAGA-3′, respectively, which correspond to all splice variants of BDNF (39Acheson A. Conover J.C. Fandl J.P. DeChiara T.M. Russell M. Thadani A. Squinto S.P. Yancopoulos G.D. Lindsay R.M. Nature. 1993; 374: 450-453Crossref Scopus (627) Google Scholar). LY294002, LY303511, wortmannin, RU38486, RU28318, dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV), and U0126 were purchased from Tocris Cookson (Bristol, UK); K252a, K252b, and U0124 were obtained from Calbiochem; rapamycin and ascomycin were obtained from Sigma. Drug Treatment—Stock solutions of LY294002, LY303511, wortmannin, K252a, K252b, rapamycin, ascomycin, U0126, and U0124 were prepared by initially dissolving in Me2SO and then diluting in aCSF before infusion. Drug and vehicle solutions had a final concentration of 10% Me2SO. Drug doses of LY294002 (10 mm), LY303511 (10 mm), wortmannin (7.3 mm), K252a (0.5 μg/μl), K252b (0.5 μg/μl), rapamycin (1 ng/μl), ascomycin (1 ng/μl), U0126 (2 μg/μl), and U0124 (2 μg/μl) were selected on the basis of published studies (13Yang C.H.

APV was dissolved in ACSF to a concentration 25 mm, which has been shown to be effective to completely abolish the novelty-induced retrograde amnesia (42Izquierdo I. Schroder N. Netto C.A. Medina J.H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3323-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The BDNF antisense and sense oligonucleotides were dissolved in ACSF and infused into the lateral ventricle at a dose of 50 pmol twice per day for 5 days (13Yang C.H. Huang C.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11029-11034Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). RU38486 was administered 30 min before stress by intraperitoneal injection with a dose of 40 mg/kg, which has been shown to be effective to completely abolish the glucocorticoid receptor-mediated functions (43Saal D. Dong Y. Bonci A. Malenka R.C. Neuron. 2003; 37: 577-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Control animals were injected with the vehicle propylene glycol for RU38486. Data Analysis—Average data are presented as mean ± S.E. Student's t tests were used to calculate significance when two groups were compared. When more than two groups were compared, a one-way analysis of variance was used, and Bonferroni multiple comparisons were used to compare the significance between groups. The number of animals used is indicated by n. Probability (p) values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. PI3K Is Activated after the Restraint-Tail Shock Stress Protocol—In response to stress protocol, significantly higher levels of circulating corticosterone concentrations (126.5 ± 7.1 ng/ml versus 9.2 ± 2.3 ng/ml in basal conditions, n = 10; p < 0.05) were observed, confirming that our experimental restraint-tail shock stress protocol activates hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal responses as described previously (11Kim J.J.

https://openalex.org/W2032650258,"Isoniazid (INH, isonicotinic acid hydrazine) is one of only two therapeutic agents effective in treating tuberculosis. This prodrug is activated by the heme enzyme catalase peroxidase (KatG) endogenous to Mycobacterium tuberculosis but the mechanism of activation is poorly understood, in part because the binding interaction has not been properly established. The class I peroxidases ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) have active site structures very similar to KatG and are also capable of activating isoniazid. We report here the first crystal structures of complexes of isoniazid bound to APX and CcP. These are the first structures of isoniazid bound to any activating enzymes. The structures show that isoniazid binds close to the delta-heme edge in both APX and CcP, although the precise binding orientation varies slightly in the two cases. A second binding site for INH is found in APX at the gamma-heme edge close to the established ascorbate binding site, indicating that the gamma-heme edge can also support the binding of aromatic substrates. We also show that in an active site mutant of soybean APX (W41A) INH can bind directly to the heme iron to become an inhibitor and in a different mode when the distal histidine is replaced by alanine (H42A). These structures provide the first unambiguous evidence for the location of the isoniazid binding site in the class I peroxidases and provide rationalization of isoniazid resistance in naturally occurring KatG mutant strains of M. tuberculosis."

Our data suggest that targeting survivin to the nucleus provides an efficient means of eliminating it from the cell and may prove a novel strategy in cancer treatment, particularly in combination with radiotherapy. Survivin is an essential mitotic protein that can also inhibit apoptosis. It is up-regulated in the vast majority of human cancers, and unlike in normal proliferating cells, in cancer cells it can be present throughout interphase, indicating a loss of cell cycle regulation. Deregulated survivin expression has been reported at both mRNA and protein levels and correlates with increased resistance to radio- and chemotherapies. In tumor biopsies, survivin has been localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm or both, and a number of studies have implied that differences in patient prognosis correlate with differences in nuclear or cytoplasmic compartmentalization. However, there is no clear consensus from these studies (1Li F. Yang J. Ramnath N. Javle M.M. Tan D. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 114: 509-512Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar).

To date, any link between subcellular compartmentalization and survivin stability has not been addressed; such regulation would have implications in terms of protein behavior, both in the etiology of tumorigenesis and in the design of chemotherapeutic targeting of the protein. To examine the consequences of expressing survivin in the nucleus rather than the cytoplasm, we have fused wild type survivin-GFP to nuclear localization signals (NLS). We herein report that nuclear survivin is subject to accelerated proteosomal degradation and an abrogation of the cytoprotection otherwise afforded by its overexpression. Together our results suggest a possible mechanism for eliminating survivin from interphase cells with a concomitant sensitization to apoptotic stimuli. Unless otherwise stated tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen, and all other chemicals were from Sigma. Cell Culture and Generation of Stable LinesHeLa cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, 500 μg/ml G418, and fungizome. Lines made specifically for the study were survivinNLS(LANA)-GFP, survivinNLS(SV40)-GFP, and GFPNLS-GFP. All other lines have been described previously (4Colnaghi R. Connell C.M.

Proteins of interest were expressed by FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science)-mediated transfection of pcDNA3.1 constructs and selected with G418 (500 μg/ml). The cells stably expressing proteins of interest were maintained similarly but were grown in the presence of G418. Prior to experimentation, the lines were sorted using an LSRII fluorescence-activated cell sorter (BD Biosciences) to ensure homogeneous populations and used within five passages of sorting. Nuclear Cytoplasmic FractionationThe cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline then resuspended in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, plus protease inhibitors). The cells were sheared by passage through a 25-gauge needle 15 times. The lysates were centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.42 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, plus protease inhibitors. The lysates were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 5 min to obtain nuclear fractions. Protein concentration was determined using a Bradford Reagent protein assay (Bio-Rad), and equal concentration of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were used for immunoblotting analyses. ImmunoblottingStandard procedures were followed for SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting and enhanced chemiluminesent detection (GE Healthcare). The antibodies used were goat anti-survivin (1/500; R & D Systems), anti-Myc (9E10, 1/500), anti-tubulin (1/2000; B512), anti-GFP (1/500; 3E1; CR-UK), anti-XRCC1 (a gift from K. Caldecott), anti-aurora-B kinase (anti-AIM1, 1/250, Transduction Labs), and anti-cdh1 (AbCam). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Dako Cytometrics and were used at dilutions of 1/1000–1/5000. Radiolabeling and ImmunoprecipitationIn vivo labeling was carried out by incubating 106 cells with 50 mCi/ml [35S]methionine. To determine the rate of protein turnover, the cells were pulsed as above and chased for up to 16 h in the presence of an excess of unlabeled amino acids. After radiolabeling cells were lysed for 30 min on ice in 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate with 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 μg/ml each of the protease inhibitors 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin A), containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 25 units/ml benzonase (VWR). The lysates were then cleared, and the supernatants were incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of a polyclonal anti-survivin (Novus) antibody. Protein G-Sepharose beads were then added (40 μl of a 50% slurry in lysis buffer), and the samples were incubated for a further 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were then washed and separated by SDS-PAGE, and band intensities were quantified from the dried gel using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Cold immunoprecipitations were performed similarly and analyzed by immunoblotting. Fluorescence MicroscopyThe cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, then fixed with 4% formaldehyde (Science Services), and permeabilized with 0.15% Triton, both in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 and 2 min, respectively (37 °C). Interphase cells were probed with anti-lamin B antibodies (C20: 1/500, Santa Cruz), and mitotic cells were probed with anti-tubulin antibodies (1/2000; B512), followed by anti-goat or anti-mouse Texas red secondary antibodies (1/200; Vector Labs). The cells were mounted in Vectashield with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole and viewed using an inverted Olympus microscope fitted with an ×63 oil immersion lens, (NA 1.35). The images were captured using a Hammamatsu CCD camera and Delta Vision Spectris software (Applied Precision). JPEG snap shots were prepared as three-dimensional projections of deconvolved z-stacks. Fields of cells were photographed using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope, fitted with an ×40 objective, and operated using Simple PCI software. Reverse Transcription-PCRRNA was extracted from 107 asynchronously growing HeLa cells using the RNAqueous kit (Ambion). RNA samples were incubated for 1 h at37 °C with RNase-free DNase (Promega) to eliminate any contaminating DNA. After inactivation of the DNase (70 °C for 10 min), RNA was precipitated with 1 volume of isopropanol and then resuspended in RNase free water. 4 μg of each sample was used for cDNA synthesis using a First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit (GE Healthcare). cDNA for exogenous survivin-GFP (and variants) was amplified using a forward primer, which annealed to the 5′ end of survivin open reading frame and a reverse primer, which annealed to the 5′-end of a GFP open reading frame. Drug Treatments, Cell Synchronization, and FACS AnalysisTo inhibit protein translation, the cells were treated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide. To inhibit protein degradation mediated by the proteasome, the cells were treated with 50 μm MG132 for 6 h or 20 μm MG132 for 16 h. When working with the NLS-tagged versions of survivin, MG132 treatment prior to cycloheximide treatment was necessary to enable detection of these proteins at the outset of the experiment. To inhibit CRM1-dependent nuclear export, the cells were treated with 6–10 ng/ml leptomycin B (LMB; VWR) for 4, 6, or 12 h as indicated. For G1 synchrony, the cells were treated overnight with 400 μm mimosine. Cell cycle distribution was determined by measuring the DNA content using flow cytometry. Briefly, 105 cells were harvested, washed, and fixed with 70% ice-cold ethanol. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 200 μl of propidium iodide solution containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 100 μg/ml RNase A (MP Biomedicals, UK). Propidium iodide-stained cells were analyzed with a FACScan cytometer using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Analysis of APC/C ModulatorsTo overexpress cdc20 and cdh1, pcDNA-cdc20-Myc and pcDNA-cdh1-Myc (gifts from Dr. Katya Ravid, University of Massachusetts, Boston, MA) were transiently transfected into HeLa cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and expression assessed 24 h later by immunoblotting using anti-Myc antibodies (9E10). To deplete cdh1 predesigned cdh1 small interfering RNA oligonucleotides (Ambion, ABI Biosystems) were transfected into HeLa cells using Hyperfect (Qiagen). Depletion was assessed by immunoblotting with anti-cdh1 antibodies (AbCam), 24 h post-transfection. X-irradiation and Clonogenic SurvivalThe cells were seeded at low density (500–1000 cells/dish) in 9-cm2 Petri dishes and allowed 2 h to attach, before exposure to X-irradiation using an Hs-X-Ray System (A.G.O. Installations Ltd., Reading, UK). Seven days post-irradiation, the colonies were stained with methylene blue (1 h at room temperature), dried, and then rinsed with H2O, and colonies of 50 cells or more were counted. Apoptosis AssaysTo induce apoptosis by the extrinsic caspase-8/caspase-3 pathway, exponentially growing cells were treated with 250 μg/ml recombinant human TRAIL (Pepro Tech EC Ltd) for 60 or 90 min. The cells were lysed (45 min at room temperature) in mammalian protein extraction buffer, MPER (Pierce), supplemented with 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), at a concentration of 106 cell equivalents/ml. The lysates were then cleared, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. To determine apoptotic activity, tetrapeptide cleavage assays were performed in a 96-well plate. Briefly, 5 ng/ml of the caspase-3-specific tetrapeptide substrate (DEVD-AMC; Biomol) was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 20–50 μl of whole cell lysate prepared in MPER (Pierce) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with 10% glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Relative fluorescence release was measured using a Spectramax Gemini fluorimeter (Molecular Devices) with excitation set at 380 nm and emission at 440 nm. Cell Viability AssayThe cells were seeded at a density of 104/well in a 24 well dish and then irradiated at the doses indicated. Seven days later, the cells were incubated with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, and cell viability was assessed using a Spectramax Gemini fluorimeter (Molecular Devices). Endogenous Survivin Is Preferentially Degraded in the NucleusIt has previously been shown that survivin is subject to proteasome-mediated degradation, because levels of endogenous survivin increase after treatment with MG132 (17Zhao J. Tenev T. Martins L.M. Downward J. Lemoine N.R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4363-4371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This increase is not due to accelerated synthesis because immunoprecipitation of endogenous survivin pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 2 h actually showed decreased incorporation of 35S (thus decreased synthesis) in the presence of MG132 (data not shown). To investigate any dependence of survivin stability on subcellular compartmentalization, we have fractionated asynchronous HeLa cells following MG132 treatment and analyzed the level of endogenous survivin in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 1A). Using tubulin and XRCC1 as markers of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, respectively, we observed a selective increase in nuclear levels of endogenous survivin following MG132 treatment. Consistent with this finding, when endogenous survivin was sequestered in the nucleus by treatment with the exportin inhibitor LMB, its expression was reduced (Fig. 1B) by ∼30%. Together, these data suggest that nuclear survivin may be less stable than survivin localized to the cytoplasm. Generation of Stable Lines Expressing SurvivinNLS-GFPSurvivin is a nuclear cytoplasmic shuttling protein that is primarily cytoplasmic when overexpressed. To further investigate post-translational regulation of survivin levels, we sought to send survivin to the nucleus. To this end we fused full-length human survivin to two separate NLS sequences, the bipartite LANA sequence RRHERPTTRRIRHRKLRS (10Munoz-Fontela C. Rodriguez E. Nombela C. Arroya J. Rivas C. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 545-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the monopartite SV40 T-antigen NLS sequence PKKKRKV (11Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 30: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1864) Google Scholar), hereinafter referred to as survivinNLS(LANA)-GFP and survivinNLS(SV40)-GFP, respectively. Because these survivin constructs are expressed from the cytomegalovirus promoter, they are not subject to transcriptional regulation; thus they enable us to investigate changes in protein level attributed solely to post-translational regulation. HeLa cell lines were generated that stably overexpressed these versions of survivin and were FACS-sorted to homogeneity prior to use. As shown in Fig. 2A, survivin-GFP was predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas both survivinNLS(LANA)-GFP and survivinNLS(SV40)-GFP were retained in the nucleus (see Fig. 2, B and C). Lines were also generated that expressed GFP or GFPNLS-GFP, for use as controls (data not shown). Importantly, the presence of an NLS on survivin did not hamper its localization in mitosis, where both constructs were found at the same locations as survivin-GFP: the centromeres, midzone, and midbody, during prometaphase, anaphase, and cytokinesis, respectively, (Fig. 2, D–F). Survivin-NLS-GFP Is Degraded More Rapidly than Survivin-GFPFrom our low magnification fluorescence data in Fig. 2 (A–C, right panels), we noted that the level of expression of survivinNLS-GFP in both lines appeared lower than for the line expressing survivin-GFP. By reverse transcription-PCR, we confirmed that the transcripts to these forms were present (Fig. 3A), and therefore mRNA was still being expressed. We also ascertained that these forms did not have different rates of protein synthesis (Fig. 3G). Thus we reasoned that the differential expression was due to differences in the rates of protein turnover. To examine this, we immunoblotted whole cell extracts from asynchronous populations of cells expressing survivin-GFP or survivinNLS-GFP. Strikingly, whereas survivin-GFP was abundantly present in untreated asynchronous cells, survivinNLS(LANA)-GFP was barely detectable (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, whereas 6 h treatment with MG132 caused only a modest (1.08-fold) increase in survivin-GFP expression (Fig. 3, B and C), survivinNLS-GFP levels rose at steady rate to 3.9-fold (Fig. 3, B and C), demonstrating that the stability of survivinNLS-GFP is proteasome dependent, as is the case for the endogenous protein (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained with survivinNLS(SV40)-GFP. As a control we also compared GFP expression in cells expressing GFP and GFPNLS-GFP. No differences in GFP expression were observed in these lines, indicating that the increased rate of turnover was not an artifact of the tag (data not shown). To determine the relative stability of these versions of survivin, cells were treated with the translational inhibitor, cycloheximide (Fig. 3, D and E). Because of the rapid clearance of the nuclear forms of survivin, this experiment had to be carried out after pretreatment with MG132 (Fig. 3E, lanes 1 and 2). Note, 16 h of treatment with MG132 did not affect cell cycle stage as assessed by FACS analysis (data not shown). Over a 16-h time course, survivinNLS(LANA)-GFP was degraded much more rapidly than survivin-GFP (Fig. 3, D and E), as is evident by the quantitation in Fig. 3F. We also noted that the addition of an NLS to GFP itself did not decrease the stability of GFP (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that the level of survivin expression was due to changes in the rate of protein synthesis, we next pulse labeled survivin-GFP and survivinNLS-GFP cells with [35S]methionine. First, the cells were treated with MG132 for 4 h, then exposed to [35S]methionine, and incubated for a further 2 h (Fig. 3G). The lysates were then prepared from each population and survivin-GFP or survivinNLS-GFP immunoprecipitated from the extracts using anti-survivin antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3G survivin-GFP and survivinNLS-GFP incorporated [35S]methionine to similar levels as quantified using a PhosphorImager (pixel intensities of bands 245246 and 246678, respectively). Next, we followed the pulse labeling with a cold chase after the removal of MG132 and the addition of cycloheximide. In accordance with our immunoblotting experiments in Fig. 3 (D–F), the rate of survivinNLS-GFP turnover was more rapid than survivin-GFP (Fig. 3H). Thus these data further indicate that survivin is less stable in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. Survivin Is Preferentially Degraded in the NucleusNext we made nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from asynchronous cultures of the stable cell lines of interest and loaded equivalent numbers of cells/lane (Fig. 4). Using tubulin and XRCC1 as markers of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, respectively, we found that survivin-GFP, like endogenous survivin, was predominantly cytoplasmic (Fig. 4A), but, consistent with our fluorescent imaging, expression of the NLS fused versions, survivinNLS(LANA)-GFP (Fig. 4B), and survivinNLS(SV40)-GFP (Fig. 4C), was extremely low. Moreover, there appeared to be little difference in expression between the two compartments, which was surprising given that survivinNLS(LANA)-GFP and survivinNLS(SV40)-GFP were specifically sent to the nucleus. However, upon 6 h of MG132 treatment, the levels of all versions of survivin, wild type and NLS-fused, rose dramatically in the nucleus, further suggesting that survivin is less stable in the nuclear versus cytoplasmic compartment. We noted that the levels of the NLS-fused forms of survivin also increased in the cytoplasmic fraction upon treatment with MG132 (Fig. 4, B and C), illustrating the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling activity of the protein. Survivin Is Degraded in the Nucleus in G1Survivin expression is normally limited to the G2/M stages of the cycle, with a rapid decline in its levels as cells exit mitosis and enter G1. A combination of factors contributes to the reduction in survivin during G1, including transcriptional repression, externalization of the midbody at the end of mitosis, and proteolysis. This prompted us to further investigate survivin degradation during G1, using cells expressing the survivin-GFP, which is not subject to transcriptional repression. The cells were synchronized in G1 using mimosine (Fig. 4D), then treated with 20 μm MG132 (Fig. 4E), and fractionated (Fig. 4F) to assess exogenous levels of survivin-GFP in the cytoplasm versus the nucleus. As with the asynchronous population following MG132 treatment (Fig. 4A), survivin-GFP was selectively up-regulated in the nucleus after 6 h of MG132 treatment in G1-arrested cells (Fig. 4F). Degradation of Nuclear Survivin Is Mediated by cdh1Expression of survivin, and its partner protein aurora-B kinase, is known to be regulated by proteolysis as cells exit mitosis (15Nguyen H.G. Chinnappan D. Urano T. Ravid K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 4977-4992Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 17Zhao J. Tenev T. Martins L.M. Downward J. Lemoine N.R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4363-4371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Degradation of aurora-B has been demonstrated to be mediated by the APC activated by cdc20 and cdh1 (15Nguyen H.G. Chinnappan D. Urano T. Ravid K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 4977-4992Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar); however, how survivin degradation is regulated has not been addressed. Thus to test whether survivin degradation was cdh1 or cdc20 dependent, we transiently overexpressed Myc-cdh1 or Myc-cdc20 (gifts from Dr. K. Ravid) in cells expressing the survivin constructs of interest. Immunoblotting analysis 24 h post-transfection revealed that cells expressing either Myc-cdh1 or Myc-cdc20 decreased the abundance of survivin-GFP, survivinNLS(LANA)-GFP and endogenous survivin in asynchronous cells (Fig. 5, A–C). This decrease in survivin levels was prevented by the addition of MG132 for 1.5 h post-transfection (Fig. 5D). (Note also, however, that the transfection efficiency with cdc20 was always lower than for cdh1). Quantitation of survivin expression from Fig. 5 (A–D) is shown in Fig. 5E and plotted as a fraction of the expression in control cells. cdh1 is a nuclear protein (12Zhou Y. Ching Y-P. Chun A. C.S. Jin D.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12530-12536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas cdc20, whose level is low in G1, is more membranous/cytoplasmic (13Weinstein J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28501-28511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, having established that survivin is degraded preferentially in the nucleus, we next asked whether depletion of cdh1 could increase survivin levels. cdh1 was depleted by small interfering RNA from asynchronous HeLa cells, and protein lysates were prepared 24 h post-transfection and analyzed for survivin expression by immunoblotting. Despite an incomplete knock down of cdh1 (54%), survivin expression doubled under these conditions (Fig. 5F). Nuclear Survivin Does Not Protect Cells against ApoptosisTo assess whether nuclear survivin is able to inhibit apoptosis, the cell lines indicated were subjected to a clonogenic survival assay after exposure to increasing doses of ionizing X-irradiation. Consistent with our previous data (4Colnaghi R. Connell C.M. Barrett R.M.A. Wheatley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33450-33456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), expression of survivin-GFP conferred resistance to X-irradiation, compared with cells expressing GFP (Fig. 6A) or GFPNLS-GFP (data not shown). By contrast no resistance to radiation was conferred by the lines expressing survivinNLS(LANA)-GFP and survivinNLS(SV40)-GFP; indeed, these lines exhibited some increased sensitivity to this treatment, although less so than cells expressing survivinL98A-GFP. Next we induced apoptosis by treatment with recombinant TRAIL and measured caspase activity in a fluorogenic tetrapeptide cleavage assay using the caspase-3-specific substrate, DEVD-AMC (Fig. 6B). The lysates were prepared from cells expressing GFP, GFP-NLS-GFP, survivin-GFP, survivinNLS-GFP, or survivinL98A-GFP (as indicated) 0 or 60 min post-treatment with TRAIL and incubated for 1 h with DEVD-AMC. In these assays survivin-GFP conferred protection against TRAIL mediated apoptosis, but cells expressing survivinNLS-GFP exhibited similar and sometimes elevated levels of caspase-3 activity to GFP and GFPNLS-GFP controls. The kinetics of the induction of caspase activity was most rapid in cells expressing the mutant version, survivinL98A-GFP, which we previously showed was nuclear and pro-apoptotic (4Colnaghi R. Connell C.M. Barrett R.M.A. Wheatley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33450-33456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Because survivin is rapidly degraded in the nucleus, we asked whether inhibiting proteolysis could restore the ability of survivin to inhibit apoptosis. The cell lines indicated were exposed to 5-Gy x-rays in the absence and presence of MG132. MG132 was removed after 6 h, and cell viability was analyzed 7 days later using an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (Fig. 6C). In this assay inhibiting proteolysis rescued the anti-apoptotic activity of survivin possibly because of the increased cytoplasmic pool that accumulates under these conditions (Fig. 4C). To ascertain specifically whether the nuclear pool of survivin can be cytoprotective, we repeated the TRAIL assay (Fig. 6B) in the absence and presence of MG132, or MG132 and LMB. In this assay, MG132 treatment caused a decrease in caspase activity in controls and experimental samples, making it difficult to assess whether increased stability of the exogenously expressed protein specifically contributes to the reduced caspase activity. However, the additional treatment of LMB caused an increase in apoptosis in survivin-GFP cells, whereas the level of caspase 3 activity in survivinNLS-GFP cells appeared to be unaffected by either treatment. These data indicate that when stabilized and completely nuclear, survivin cannot inhibit apoptosis. Taken together our present data suggest that forced expression of survivin in the nucleus is sufficient to prevent it from inhibiting apoptosis in cultured human cells. Survivin is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shutting protein that is predominantly cytoplasmic when overexpressed in cultured cells (2Rodriguez J.A. Span S.W. Ferreira C.G.M. Kruyt F.A.E. Giaccone G. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 275: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Wheatley S.P. Carvalho A. Vagnarelli P. Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 886-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We and others have recently shown that this subcellular localization is dependent upon CRM1 (β-exportin) and a rev-like NES in the linker region of survivin, between its BIR domain and the C-terminal α-helix (2Rodriguez J.A.

Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that survivin is preferentially degraded in the nucleus in a cdh1/APC-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with cdh1-mediated degradation of survivin in vitro (14Pines J. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 55-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and the nuclear localization of cdh1 in G1 (12Zhou Y. Ching Y-P. Chun A. C.S. Jin D.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12530-12536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Somewhat paradoxically, survivin appears to be devoid of destruction motifs recognized by the APC/C. However, the mitotic partner protein of survivin, aurora-B, has three putative D-boxes, a KEN box, and an A-box, and mutation of the cdh1-specific KEN and A-boxes stabilize aurora-B, suggesting that its destruction is mediated preferentially by cdh1 (15Nguyen H.G. Chinnappan D. Urano T. Ravid K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 4977-4992Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 16Stewart S. Fang G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8730-8735Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, aurora-B also exhibits accelerated clearance upon overexpression of cdh1, exhibits increased stability upon cdh1 depletion, and co-immunoprecipitates with cdh1 in mitotic extracts (15Nguyen H.G. Chinnappan D. Urano T. Ravid K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 4977-4992Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 16Stewart S. Fang G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8730-8735Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, because survivin and aurora-B are both destroyed at the end of mitosis (14Pines J. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 55-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 15Nguyen H.G. Chinnappan D. Urano T. Ravid K. Mol.

Martins L.M. Downward J. Lemoine N.R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4363-4371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is formally possible that survivin relies on the consensus sequences of aurora-B for destruction. We are currently testing this hypothesis. In a previous report we found that a mutant form of survivin that accumulates in the nucleus could no longer protect cells against ionizing radiation or TRAIL-induced apoptosis (4Colnaghi R. Connell C.M. Barrett R.M.A. Wheatley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33450-33456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Corroborating data were recently presented by Stauber and co-workers (6Stauber R.H. Rabenhorst U. Rekik A. Engels K. Bier C. Knauer S.K. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1461-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7Knauer S.K. Kramer O.H. Knosel T. Engels K. Rodel F. Kovács A.F. Dietmaier W. L. K.-H. Habtemichael N. Schweitzer A.

Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, these experiments raised the question as to whether subcellular relocalization alone was responsible for abrogating the anti-apoptotic activity of survivin or whether the effect was mutant specific. Here, we have artificially forced wild type human survivin expression in the nucleus and observed that this relocation prevented survivin from acting as an inhibitor of apoptosis. Furthermore, in some cases we actually noted an increase in sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli, the reason for which is unclear. One possibility may be that the subcellular localization of the exogenous protein influences the localization of the endogenous protein. In a recent study Temme et al. (5Temme A. Rodriguez J.A. Hendruschk S. Gunes S. Weigle B. Schakel K. Schmitz M. Bachmann M. Schackert G. Rieber E.P. Cancer Lett. 2007; 250: 177-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) also found that cells were more sensitive to apoptosis when they forced survivin expression in the nucleus, and interestingly they linked this observation to enhanced transcription of p53, and the pro-apoptotic genes, Bad and Bax. Our present data appear to contradict the recent work by Stauber et al. (6Stauber R.H. Rabenhorst U. Rekik A. Engels K. Bier C. Knauer S.K. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1461-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), who reported that nuclear sequestration of murine survivin via deletion of the NES increased the stability of the protein, thus suggesting that it is preferentially degraded in the cytoplasm. However, it is possible that deletion of these residues could have affected the folding or stability of survivin specifically rather than increased its stability as a result of its subcellular relocalization. (Note also that our experiments used stable cell lines rather than transiently transfected cells, which could have contributed to the different results). Differential stability caused by subcellular compartmentalization has been noted for a number of proteins including p53, whose localization and stability is altered upon DNA damage (18Joseph T.W. Zaika A. Moll U.M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1622-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the survivin isoform Delta-Ex3, which is nuclear when overexpressed (19Mahotka C. Wenzel M. Springer E. Gabbert H.E. Gerharz C.D. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6097-6102PubMed Google Scholar, 20Noton E.A. Colnaghi R. Tate S. Starck C. Carvalho A. Ferrigno P.K. Wheatley S.P. J. Biol.

Suschek C.V. Schmitt M. Gabbert H.E. Gerharz C.D. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1334-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and may explain why endogenous survivin DeX3 is difficult to detect at the protein level (20Noton E.A. Colnaghi R.

Fangusaro J. Mahotka C. Altura R.A. Conway E.M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1994-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has recently been reported that survivin degradation can also be facilitated by the XIAP association factor, XAF-1, in a proteasome-dependent manner, which suggests that multiple pathways for ensuring the removal of survivin from interphase cells exist (24Arora V.

Finally, survivin has a functional NES but no NLS. Thus one outstanding question is how is survivin gaining access to the nucleus? Although the endogenous protein is small enough to enter the nucleus by diffusion even if dimerized, this is unlikely given the behavior of the GFP tagged form. Of the known binding partners of survivin, aurora-B has sequences that correspond to NLSs but appear nonfunctional in a nuclear targeting assay, and INCENP has three functional NLSs (3Rodriguez J.A. Lens S.M.A. Span S.W. Vader G. Medema R.H. Kruyt F.A.E. Giaccone G. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4867-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, when overexpressed in MCF cells, neither aurora-B nor INCENP was able to influence survivin localization, which remained predominantly cytoplasmic (3Rodriguez J.A. Lens S.M.A. Span S.W. Vader G. Medema R.H. Kruyt F.A.E. Giaccone G. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4867-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Another candidate for nuclear targeting is TD60, an RCC1-like protein that has a putative NLS and that co-localizes with the chromosomal passenger proteins (23Mollinari C. Reynaud C. Martineau-Thuillier S. Monier S. Kieffer S. Garin J. Andreassen P.R. Boulet A. Goud B. Kleman J-P. Margolis R.L. Dev. 5 Cell. 2003; 5: 295-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that chromosomal passenger proteins have cell cycle-dependent expression, and whether they are present in interphase cells when survivin is overexpressed is unknown. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that relocating survivin to the nucleus accelerates its degradation and prevents it from protecting cells against irradiation and inhibiting apoptosis. We have also shown that the presence of an NLS on survivin does not affect its mitotic function. Thus sequestering survivin in the nucleus could be very helpful in cancer therapy because it would resensitize cells to radiation without affecting the proliferation of noncancerous cells.

https://openalex.org/W2012603856,"In this study we offer a mechanistic interpretation of the previously known but unexplained substrate inhibition observed for CYP2E1. At low substrate concentrations, p-nitrophenol (pNP) was rapidly turned over (47 min-1) with relatively low Km (24 μm); nevertheless, at concentrations of >100 μm, the rate of pNP oxidation gradually decreased as a second molecule bound to CYP2E1 through an effector site (Kss = 260 μm), which inhibited activity at the catalytic site. 4-Methylpyrazole (4MP) was a potent inhibitor for both sites through a mixed inhibition mechanism. The Ki for the catalytic site was 2.0 μm. Although we were unable to discriminate whether an EIS or ESI complex formed, the respective inhibition constants were far lower than Kss. Bicyclic indazole (IND) inhibited catalysis through a single CYP2E1 site (Ki = 0.12 μm). Similarly, 4MP and IND yielded type II binding spectra that reflected the association of either two 4MP or one IND molecule(s) to CYP2E1, respectively. Based on computational docking studies with a homology model for CYP2E1, the two sites for monocyclic molecules, pNP and 4MP, exist within a narrow channel connecting the active site to the surface of the enzyme. Because of the presence of the heme iron, one site supports catalysis, whereas the other more distal effector site binds molecules that can influence the binding orientation and egress of molecules for the catalytic site. Although IND did not bind these sites simultaneously, the presence of IND at the catalytic site blocked binding at the effector site.

Although IND did not bind these sites simultaneously, the presence of IND at the catalytic site blocked binding at the effector site. CYP2E1 (P450 or CYP for a particular isoform) is a mammalian cytochrome P450 enzyme, which oxidizes a structurally diverse class of endogenous and exogenous (xenobiotic) compounds (1Guengerich F.P. Toxicol. Lett. 1994; 70: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 2Ronis M. Lindros K.O. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Ioannides C. Cytochromes P450, Metabolic and Toxicological Aspects. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1996: 211-239Google Scholar). A majority of studies have focused on the role of CYP2E1 in phase I metabolism of xenobiotic compounds, e.g. drugs, food additives, and environmental contaminants. Growing evidence also supports an important physiological role for CYP2E1 in gluconeogenesis. CYP2E1 is regulated similarly to enzymes contributing to gluconeogenesis in relation to starvation and diabetes and, in fact, recognizes precursors to gluconeogenesis, acetone, acetol (1-hydroxyacetone), and fatty acids (3Robertson G. Leclercq I. Farrell G.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1135-G1139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as substrates.Nevertheless, the selectivity that governs the transformation of molecules by CYP2E1 is poorly understood. A better knowledge of the molecular features that confer specificity of substrates allows predictions to be made as to pharmaco- and toxico-kinetic properties, and such insights are ultimately exploitable in novel drug development and assessment of risk associated with exposure to environmental chemicals. Moreover, the catalytic capacity for CYP2E1 makes the enzyme an excellent target for engineering specific catalytic properties for commercial production of specialty chemicals and remediation activities into plants and other organisms, as reported recently (4Doty S.L. Shang T.Q. Wilson A.M. Tangen J. Westergreen A.D. Newman L.A. Strand S.E. Gordon M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6287-6291Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5Banerjee S.

Bioeng. 2002; 77: 462-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).CYP2E1 has broad substrate specificity toward typically small (molecular weight < 100) and hydrophobic molecules (2Ronis M. Lindros K.O. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Ioannides C. Cytochromes P450, Metabolic and Toxicological Aspects. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1996: 211-239Google Scholar, 6Guengerich F.P. Kim D.H. Iwasaki M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 168-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). Of the more than 70 different chemicals recognized by this enzyme, a majority of the substrates are short chain alcohols/ketones/aldehydes (e.g. ethanol), nitrosamines, alkanes, halogenated alkanes, and anesthetics. CYP2E1 also recognizes many monocyclic compounds possessing minimal substitutions, e.g. benzene, p-nitrophenol (pNP), 2The abbreviations used are: pNPp-nitrophenol4MP4-methylpyrazoleINDbicyclic indazoleHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyDLPCdilauroyl-l-α-phosphatidylcholinepNCp-nitrocatechol. 2The abbreviations used are: pNPp-nitrophenol4MP4-methylpyrazoleINDbicyclic indazoleHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyDLPCdilauroyl-l-α-phosphatidylcholinepNCp-nitrocatechol. acetaminophen, isoniazid, and xylenes. Chlorzoxazone, coumarin, quinoline, and caffeine form a smaller class of bicyclic substrates recognized by CYP2E1. Surprisingly, even the long chain fatty acid, arachidonate, is a substrate. Of these compounds, pNP (7Koop D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 399-404PubMed Google Scholar) and chlorzoxazone (8Yamazaki H. Guo Z. Guengerich F.P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 438-440PubMed Google Scholar) are commonly used in model reactions for CYP2E1 activity. Taken together, these findings implicate a degree of selectivity for the CYP2E1 activity through a restrictive active site.Although many CYP2E1 substrates conform to a binary kinetic scheme (Scheme 1), Koop (7Koop D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 399-404PubMed Google Scholar) reported the first example of substrate inhibition for pNP oxidation. Instead of the hyperbolic curve predicted by Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the increase in pNP concentration led to a rise in the observed rate of turnover until a maximum was reached, and then the rate gradually decreased at higher pNP concentrations. Although the effect was attributed to a classical substrate inhibition mechanism, the data were not fit to the mechanism. The substrate inhibition mechanism predicts that association of a second molecule with the enzyme forms an inactive ternary complex (ES2) (Scheme 1). Higher substrate concentrations favor this latter complex resulting in decreased activity. Further evidence for the possibility of two binding sites for monocyclic molecules was shown through inhibition studies with CYP2E1 (9Hargreaves M.B. Jones B.C. Smith D.A. Gescher A. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1994; 22: 806-810PubMed Google Scholar). The introduction of a variety of 5- and 6-membered heterocyclic molecules to pNP catalytic assays demonstrated competitive, uncompetitive, noncompetitive, and mixed type inhibition. The latter three models require the presence of a secondary site for the inhibitor to bind; however, the preference for these different mechanisms based on ligand structure was not explored. A possible limitation of these studies was the use of only three concentrations of pNP for analyses. These conditions may not have been sufficient to elucidate the mode of interaction between these molecules and CYP2E1.Here, we explain this kinetic anomaly in terms of both mechanistic and structural views and extend our analysis to include typical representatives of monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic inhibitors. Specifically, we employed 4-methylpyrazole (4MP) and indazole (IND) (Fig. 1) as inhibitors for CYP2E1 oxidation of pNP. The monocyclic 4MP presumably binds competitively to each sub-site occupied by pNP, whereas the larger bicyclic IND would bind to both sub-sites simultaneously. This mode of interaction should yield different inhibition kinetic profiles. In addition to serving as potent inhibitors, the pyrazole ring of these molecules can ligate the heme iron resulting in type II binding spectra (10Jefcoate C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 258-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), and thus provide a useful measure of binding affinity between the monocyclic and bicyclic molecules and CYP2E1. Unfortunately, pNP was not suitable for binding studies because of the spectral overlap between pNP and the heme. To identify the mode of interaction between these molecules and CYP2E1, we proposed multiple possible mechanisms incorporating one or two binding sites for molecules. We fit the resulting data from experimental studies to these models and performed model discrimination analysis based on the second-order Akaike Information Criterion, which properly takes into account the fact that various fitting models contain a different number of adjustable parameters. As a complement to these indirect approaches to identifying complexes, we explored the ability of CYP2E1 to accommodate one or two of these monocyclic and bicyclic compounds through computational docking studies with a homology model developed by our group (11Collom S.L. Jamakhandi A.P. Tackett A.J. Radominska-Pandya A. Miller G.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 459: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The location of these potential binding sites would demonstrate whether a second site for a monocyclic compound exists within the active site or distal from the site of oxidation.FIGURE 1Substrate and inhibitors used in this study to probe CYP2E1 binding and activity toward monocyclic and bicyclic compounds.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagentsC41 (DE3) cells used in CYP2E1 expression were purchased from Imaxio (France).

Backes (Louisiana State University Health Science Center, New Orleans).Steady-state pNP Oxidation StudiesInitial velocities for rabbit P450 2E1 oxidation of pNP to p-nitrocatechol were determined by a high throughput HPLC method developed in our laboratory (11Collom S.L. Jamakhandi A.P. Tackett A.J. Radominska-Pandya A. Miller G.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 459: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For reactions, 25 nm CYP2E1 was reconstituted with 100 nm CPR-K56Q and 50 nm cytochrome b5 in a 96-well assay block containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 20 μm DLPC, pNP (varied from 5 to 750 μm), 2 units μl-1 catalase, 0.04 μg μl-1 superoxide dismutase, and an NADPH-regenerating system (2 microunits μl-1 glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 2 mm MgCl2, 500 μm NADP+). Prior to use, catalase was dialyzed against 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol to remove the thymol preservative.Specific reactions in the absence or presence of inhibitor were prepared in sets of eight, which facilitated sample manipulation with a multichannel pipette. 4MP prepared in water was added to the reactions to final concentrations of 0, 1, 5, 25, and 125 μm to attempt to saturate a possible second site for 4MP. IND stocks were made in methanol because of solubility concerns. The steady-state kinetics for the reactions in the presence of the methanol alone (final 0.25%) were determined to correct for co-solvent effects. Final concentrations for this inhibitor were 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 μm. Following addition of all components except NADP+, reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Upon addition of NADP+, a reaction aliquot was taken at four time points, transferred to a 96-well microplate, quenched with acetonitrile containing 2-nitroresorcinol (internal standard), and then centrifuged. The supernatant was transferred to a low volume HPLC vial held in a 96-vial rack that matched the 96-well format for the quenched samples. As described previously (11Collom S.L. Jamakhandi A.P. Tackett A.J. Radominska-Pandya A. Miller G.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 459: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), an autosampler housing 96 vials injected each rack of samples onto a Waters Symmetry C18 3.5 μm 4.6 × 75 mm column with a 75:25 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O/CH3CN mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.5 ml min-1. The elution of pNC, the internal standard, and pNP were monitored at 320 nm. pNC production during the reaction was quantitated relative to pNC standards. The corresponding concentrations were plotted as a function of time, and the initial rate was determined by linear regression with the software program Graph-Pad Prism (San Diego, CA). Reported initial rates reflect averages of data from 2 to 4 experiments.Given the observed substrate inhibition during pNP oxidation (7Koop D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 399-404PubMed Google Scholar), all possible mechanisms for CYP2E1 included two binding sites for substrate leading to one active complex; nevertheless, there were multiple possible modes of inhibition (Scheme 2). Similar to the traditional mechanism for competitive inhibition, the inhibitor could bind only to free enzyme at the catalytic site to yield single-site inhibition. Alternatively, the inhibitor could bind to both sites occupied by substrate (two-site inhibition). Although substrate was an allosteric effector toward itself, the issue of allosterism may not apply for all binding events. In fact, there were four possible outcomes. Both substrate and inhibitor could alter binding of the other molecule (model 1). For model 2, only substrate acted allosterically, such that substrate affected inhibitor binding (Ki ≠ Ksi) but inhibitor did not affect substrate binding (Ks = Kis). Model 3 described the alternative possibility wherein inhibitor was the only allosteric effector. In this case, the inhibitor altered substrate binding (Ks ≤ Kis), whereas substrate did not affect inhibitor binding (Ki = Ksi). In the absence of allosterism (traditional noncompetitive inhibition, model 4), all inhibition constants were the same and the ESI and EIS complexes were equivalent.SCHEME 2Possible inhibition mechanisms for CYP2E1 pNP activity by 4MP and IND.

Input files (scripts) for this analysis are included in the supplemental material.Determination of Binding Mechanism for 4MP and INDPerturbation of the P450 Soret spectra because of the association of ligands is a useful tool for assessing binding events (17Schenkman J.B. Remmer H. Estabrook R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1967; 3: 113-123PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we monitored the shift from the high spin to the low spin state for the iron upon ligation of nitrogen-bearing molecules, 4MP and IND, to the heme iron. Formation of the Fe-N bond increased the absorbance near 430 nm and decreased the absorbance near 390 nm as a function of ligand concentration. Stocks for 4MP were prepared in H2O and IND in methanol based on the solubility of these compounds. The titrations with these solutions were performed using tandem cuvettes to correct for any solvent effects on CYP2E1 absorbance and possible contributions from titrant to observed changes in absorbance. Specifically, we titrated 0.1 μm CYP2E1 in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 20 μm DLPC with increasing amounts of ligand at 25 °C. Glycerol was included to stabilize the protein against denaturation. Spectral changes were recorded from 350 to 475 nm using a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer. In the process, we generated difference spectra by substrating the reference CYP2E1 sample with solvent from the absorbance of the sample with titrant present. Data from 4 to 6 experiments were compiled and averaged for analyses.Although only one molecule can associate with the heme iron, multiple binding events can be observable if the association of subsequent molecules induces a different spectroscopic species. Based on the observed substrate inhibition for pNP oxidation by CYP2E1, the binding of two monocyclic molecules was conceivable. To determine the stoichiometry of CYP2E1 complexes with small molecules, we employed the software program DynaFit as described for analysis of the catalytic data. For these studies we fit absorbance data to mechanisms incorporating either one or two binding events (Scheme 3). When two molecules were bound to CYP2E1, we included the possibility that EL, EL2, or both complexes yielded a spectroscopic signal as denoted by the asterisk. Input files (scripts) for this analysis are included in supplemental material.SCHEME 3Possible CYP2E1 binding modes for 4MP and IND.

The three-dimensional coordinates of the CYP2E1 enzyme were obtained from previous experimental work that yielded a homology model for the enzyme (11Collom S.L. Jamakhandi A.P. Tackett A.J. Radominska-Pandya A. Miller G.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 459: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Essential hydrogen atoms and Gasteiger-Huckel partial charges were assigned to the protein sequence. The three-dimensional coordinates of the substrates (including hydrogen atoms and partial charges) were constructed and energy-minimized using the Tripos force field with the default settings in Sybyl7.2.Surflex-Dock 2.0 (18Jain A. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) was used to perform flexible docking (with default settings) of the substrates in the binding site of CYP2E1. Surflex-Dock uses an empirical scoring function and a patented search engine to dock the substrates into the CYP2E1-binding site. The scoring function is a weighted sum of nonlinear functions involving van der Waals surface distances between the appropriate pairs of exposed enzyme and substrate atoms (19Jain A. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1996; 10: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Scores are expressed in pKd units to represent binding affinities.RESULTSCYP2E1 Steady-state Activity toward pNPAs reported previously (7Koop D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 399-404PubMed Google Scholar), CYP2E1 oxidation of pNP led to significant substrate inhibition. The substrate saturation curve displayed a maximum followed by a decrease in activity (open circle, Fig. 2), indicating the traditional Michaelis-Menten kinetic scheme for a single substrate binding site (Scheme 1) could not explain substrate turnover. As an alternative, we fit the data to a two-substrate binding mechanism (Scheme 1) using DynaFit as described (15Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). CYP2E1 demonstrated a relatively low Kss (24 μm) and the rapid turnover of 47 min-1 for pNP; nevertheless, at higher pNP concentrations (>100 μm), the activity gradually decreased as a second molecule bound to CYP2E1 through an effector site (Ks 260 μm), which inhibited activity at the catalytic site (Table 3). This set of experiments was included in 4MP inhibition studies because of common absence of an organic co-solvent (see below).FIGURE 2Steady-state oxidation of pNP by CYP2E1 in the presence of 4MP (A) or IND (B). For reactions, 25 nm CYP2E1, 100 nm CPR-K56Q, and 50 nm cytochrome b5 were reconstituted in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 20 μm DLPC, pNP (varied from 5 to 750 μm), 2 units μl-1 catalase, 0.04 μg μl-1 superoxide dismutase, and an NADPH-regenerating system (2 microunits μl-1 glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 2 mm MgCl2, 500 μm NADP+) at 37 °C.

Given the observed substrate inhibition during pNP oxidation (7Koop D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 399-404PubMed Google Scholar), all possible mechanisms for CYP2E1 inhibition by these molecules included two binding sites for substrate leading to one active complex; nevertheless, there were multiple possible modes of inhibition that depended on whether substrate or inhibitor acted allosterically (Scheme 2). After globally fitting reactions to these mechanisms, we generated a corresponding Akaike information criterion (AICc) to identify statistically the most plausible based on the quality of the fits. The significance rules as outlined by Burnham and Anderson (20Burnham K.P. Anderson D.R. 2nd Ed. Model Selection and Multi-model Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York2002: 70Google Scholar) provided a metric to rank models such that the lower AICc values indicated comparatively high support for the mechanism. When comparing the ΔAICc, values between 0 and 2 indicate substantial support, whereas values between 4 and 7 signify considerably less support. A value for ΔAICc greater than 10 indicates essentially no support for the model.For 4MP, there was a significant preference for model 2a based on ΔAICc values greater than 10 for all other possibilities (Table 1). In this mechanism, 4MP and pNP compete for the same binding sites and alter affinity at the opposing site. Analysis of the parameters revealed extremely large uncertainty in Kis and Ksi, which correspond to the mixed substrate-inhibitor complexes, despite using concentrations of 4MP up to 125 μm or 100-fold greater than the predicted Kd for the second site (see below). This observation suggested that we perform a second round of model discrimination analysis. Data were fit to variations of model 2a whereby either the ESI or EIS complexes did not form (Scheme 2). These simpler mechanisms were preferred over model 2a with equal probability, as shown through model discrimination analysis (Table 2).TABLE 1Model discrimination analysis for 4MP and IND inhibition of CYP2E1 pNP activityModelAllosteric effectorP4MPINDRSSΔAICcwRSSΔAICcwSingle-site inhibition 1 Two-site inhibitionNone40.0714543.30.00000.0146500.95252a2bS, I60.0285900.99980.014656.000.04732cS50.0444920.80.00030.0247121.70.00002dI50.0441420.40.00040.0420740.90.0000None40.0440417.70.00140.0234216.90.0002 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Second round of model discrimination analysis for 4MP inhibition of CYP2E1 pNP activityVariation of Model 2aPRSSΔAICcwNone60.028582.660.1166ESI does not form50.0285800.4417EIS does not form50.0285800.4417 Open table in a new tab Table 3 lists the best fit values for the parameters and non-symmetrical 99% confidence intervals corresponding to the respective mechanisms. The affinity of 4MP for these sites was much higher than that observed for the substrate. The 4MP Ki for the catalytic site was 2.0 μm compared with a Km of 24 μm for pNP. Depending on which mixed complex was present, the second 4MP molecule bound to the effector site with a Kis of 10 μm or a Ksi of 120 μm, whereas the pNP Kss value was 260 μm.Because of low solubility in aqueous solution, the studies with the inhibitor IND required a co-solvent, methanol, which altered pNP turnover parameters (Table 1). Compared with the absence of co-solvent, kcat deceased slightly from 47 to 37 min-1. More significantly, Km increased from 24 to 51 μm, whereas Kss decreased from 260 to 130 μm. The apparent solvent inhibition as reported by others (21Easterbrook J. Lu C. Sakai Y. Li A.P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 141-144PubMed Google Scholar) likely reflects competition or changes in binding sites between methanol and other molecules because of the ability of the methanol to also serve as a substrate (22Coon M.J. Koop D.R. Morgan E.T. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1983; 18: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To normalize these effects among experiments, we used a constant concentration of methanol (0.25%) in experiments from 0 to 1 μm IND.Unlike 4MP, IND inhibited pNP oxidation through simple competition for a single site on the enzyme as described by model 1 (Table 1). The presence of bound IND effectively blocks binding of pNP to either catalytic or effector sites resulting in an inactive complex. As shown in Table 3, IND was a potent inhibitor of CYP2E1 activity with a Ki of 0.12 μm. In fact, studies were limited to a maximum of 1 μm IND because of significance inhibition of activity under those conditions.Binding of 4MP and IND by CYP2E1In addition to specific inhibition of CYP2E1 activity, 4MP and IND were excellent candidates for yieldi"
https://openalex.org/W1997598428,"In mammalian cells, four Na+/H+ exchangers (NHE6 - NHE9) are localized to intracellular compartments. NHE6 and NHE9 are predominantly localized to sorting and recycling endosomes, NHE7 to the trans-Golgi network, and NHE8 to the mid-trans-Golgi stacks. The unique localization of NHEs may contribute to establishing organelle-specific pH values and ion homeostasis in cells. Mechanisms underlying the regulation and targeting of organellar NHEs are largely unknown. We identified an interaction between NHE9 and RACK1 (receptor for activated C kinase 1), a cytoplasmic scaffold protein, by yeast two-hybrid screening using the NHE9 C terminus as bait. The NHE9 C terminus is exposed to the cytoplasm, verifying that the interaction is topologically possible. The binding region was further delineated to the central region of the NHE9 C terminus. RACK1 also bound NHE6 and NHE7, but not NHE8, in vitro. Endogenous association between NHE6 and RACK1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization in HeLa cells. The luminal pH of the recycling endosome was elevated in RACK1 knockdown cells, accompanied by a decrease in the amount of NHE6 on the cell surface, although the total level of NHE6 was not significantly altered. These results indicate that RACK1 plays a role in regulating the distribution of NHE6 between endosomes and the plasma membrane and contributes to maintaining luminal pH of the endocytic recycling compartments.

These results indicate that RACK1 plays a role in regulating the distribution of NHE6 between endosomes and the plasma membrane and contributes to maintaining luminal pH of the endocytic recycling compartments. Maintenance of the luminal pH of intracellular compartments is fundamental for various cellular events, such as receptor-mediated endocytosis and recycling to the plasma membrane (1Carnell L. Moore H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 693-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 2Cosson P. de Curtis I. Pouyssegur J. Griffiths G. Davoust J. J.

Oka T. Sun-Wada G. Moriyama Y. Kanazawa H. Wada Y. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 107-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of observations have also indicated the existence of proton leak systems. For example, pharmacological inhibition of V-ATPase results in an immediate dissipation of the proton gradient across the organellar membrane (4Kim J.H. Lingwood C.A. Williams D.B. Furuya W. Manolson M.F. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1387-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The luminal pH along the secretory pathway becomes gradually acidic from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi and secretory vesicles. A previous fluorescence imaging study using live endocrine cells estimated that proton pump activity increases and, on the contrary, proton leakage decreases along the secretory pathway (5Wu M.M.

Although our understanding of the molecular identities responsible for proton leakage is incomplete, it is assumed that organelle-specific pH is controlled by a balance between two major activities (i.e. proton pumping by V-ATPases and proton leakage from the organellar lumen) (6Paroutis P. Touret N. Grinstein S. Physiol. (Bethesda). 2004; 19: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar).To date, nine Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) isoforms have been identified in mammals. NHE1-NHE5 are localized to the plasma membrane in various cell types (7Sardet C. Franchi A. Pouyssegur J.

NHE6 and NHE9 are predominantly localized to sorting and recycling endosomes in several cultured cell lines (12Nakamura N. Tanaka S. Teko Y. Mitsui K. Kanazawa H. J. Biol.

NHE7 and NHE8 are localized primarily to the trans-Golgi network and mid-trans-Golgi stacks, respectively (12Nakamura N. Tanaka S. Teko Y. Mitsui K. Kanazawa H. J. Biol.

Four organellar NHEs may mediate K+/H+ exchange rather than Na+/H+ exchange under physiological conditions and could be responsible for proton leakage from organelles, contributing to the establishment of a unique organellar luminal pH. The boundaries of such intracellular compartments are not static and not definite, since the organelles are connected by continuous membrane trafficking. Therefore, the steady state localization of NHE isoforms is under a dynamic equilibrium. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the localization and activity of organellar NHEs.NHEs are composed of a relatively conserved N-terminal transmembrane domain (10-12 transmembrane helices) and a more variable C-terminal hydrophilic domain. In NHE1, the most extensively studied isoform, the C-terminal domain is cytoplasmic (15Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and serves as a regulatory domain. The interaction of NHE1 with lipids and with various proteins, including calcium-binding proteins, kinases, and scaffolding proteins, plays an important role in modulating the activity and localization of NHE1 (16Aharonovitz O.

Divergent amino acid sequences in the C-terminal domains of NHEs suggest the existence of NHE isoform-specific functions and regulatory mechanisms.We conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen using the C terminus of human NHE9 as bait to identify interacting proteins that may regulate intracellular NHEs. RACK1, a scaffold protein originally identified from a rat brain cDNA library as an anchoring protein for protein kinase C (20Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), was identified. Pulldown assays showed that three NHE isoforms (NHE6, -7, and -9) interact with RACK1. The function of RACK1 in the distribution of NHE6 between endosomes and the cell surface and in the maintenance of endosomal pH was investigated.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection–COS-7 and HeLa cells were maintained with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For transfection of plasmid DNA, TransIT LT-1 (Mirus) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three sets of duplex siRNAs targeted against human RACK1 and a control siRNA were purchased from Invitrogen for RACK1 knockdown. Transfection of siRNA was performed with Lipofectamine 2000.Plasmid Construction for Expression in Escherichia coli and Yeast–To obtain pGBT9-hNHE9Ct-(494-645), the corresponding DNA fragment was amplified by PCR with the following primers: forward1 (5′-GGGGGATCCGACCTGGATGAAAATCTGAAG-3′) and reverse1 (5′-GGGGTCGACTTAATTCAACTGGGATTGACC-3′). The PCR product was cloned into the GAL4BD-fusion expression vector pGBT9 with BamHI-SalI. For expression of recombinant MBP fusion proteins, the corresponding DNA fragments for hNHE6, hNHE7, hNHE8, and hNHE9 were amplified by PCR from previously constructed NHE plasmids (12Nakamura N. Tanaka S. Teko Y. Mitsui K. Kanazawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1561-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In all constructs, BamHI-SalI PCR fragments were cloned into the pMAL-cRI bacterial expression vector (New England Biolabs). Primers used were as follows: NHE9-(494-645), forward1 and reverse1; NHE9-(528-645), forward2 (5′-GGGGGATCCATGTGGTATAGCTTTGACCA-3′) and reverse1; NHE9-(494-577), forward1 and reverse2 (5′-CGCGTCGACTTAATCATCCTCTTTTAGCTGTT-3′); NHE9-(528-577), forward2 and reverse2; NHE9-(494-527), forward1 and reverse3 (5′-CGCGTCGACTTATCTGAAGAGCCGAGCACTCT-3′); NHE9-(578-645), forward3 (5′-GGGGGATCCGTGGAATGCATTGTAAACCAG-3′) and reverse1; NHE6-(511-669), forward4 (5′-GCGGGATCCGATTCAGACCAAGAACACTT-3′) and reverse4 (5′-GCGGTCGACTTAGGCTGGACCATGTCTCGTAT-3′); NHE7-(542-725), forward5 (5′-GCGGGATCCGAGGAGCCCTCCGAAGAGGA-3′) and reverse5 (5′-GCGGTCGACTTAAGCATTATCTTCCAGGGGAA-3′); NHE8-(481-581), forward6 (5′-GGGGGATCCGAGGACGCCAAGGCACACCGC-3′) and reverse6 (5′-GGGGTCGACTCAGAGCAGCTCCTGCTCGTC-3′). For the internal deletion of residues 528-577 in NHE9, (NHE9-Δ(528-577)), first PCR was performed with each of the following primer sets: 1) forward1 and reverse7 (5′-TGGTTTACAATGCATTCCACTCTGAAGAGCCGAGCACTCT-3′) and 2) forward7 (5′-AGAGTGCTCGGCTCTTCAGAGTGGAATGCATTGTAAACCA-3′) and reverse1. The two PCR products were then mixed and integrated by second PCR with the forward1 and reverse1 primers.Plasmid Construction for Expression in Mammalian Cells–Expression vectors encoding C-terminally tagged human NHE6-HA (NHE6.0), NHE7-HA, NHE9-HA, and NHE9-MycHis were constructed as described previously (12Nakamura N. Tanaka S. Teko Y. Mitsui K. Kanazawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1561-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The I.M.A.G.E. cDNA clone of NHE6.1 (clone ID: 5312949) was purchased from Open Biosystems. Fragments corresponding to the 5′-half of an ORF, including a NHE6.1-specific insertion, was amplified by PCR with the following primers: forward (5′-GGGGAATTCATGGCTCGGCGCGGCTGGCGGCGGGCACCCCTCCGCCGTGGCGTCGGCAG-3′) and reverse (5′-TGAACAGTGTCAGCCCCATGTAGGA-3′). The PCR product was substituted for the EcoRI-BstXI fragment of a previously constructed plasmid for hNHE6.0 to obtain expression vectors encoding untagged and HA-tagged human NHE6.1. To construct an expression plasmid for Myc-VAMP3 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 3)-EGFP, a PCR fragment encoding N-terminal Myc-tagged human VAMP3 was amplified from a human skeletal muscle cDNA library by PCR with the following primers: forward (5′-GGGGAATTCATGGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGGGTGGTATGTCTACAGGTCCAACTGC-3′) and reverse (5′-CCCGGATCCTGAAGAGACAACCCACACGA-3′). The Myc tag sequence is included in the forward primer. An EcoRI-BamHI fragment was introduced into pEGFP-N3. The plasmid was then further used as a template to construct the VAMP3-EGFP-Myc expression plasmid. A PCR fragment encoding C-terminally GFP- and Myc-tagged VAMP3 was amplified with the following primers: forward (5′-GGGGAATTCATGTCTACAGGTCCAACTGC-3′) and reverse (5′-CCCGCGGCCGCTCACAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTGTTCACCACCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGC-3′). The N-terminal Myc tag sequence was omitted from the forward primer and instead included in the reverse primer. The EcoRI-NotI fragment was introduced into pEGFP-N3.To construct an expression vector for the GFP-fused RACK1 binding region of NHE6 (GFP-NHE6-(537-588)), the corresponding EcoRI-BamHI fragment from the bacterial expression plasmid for MBP-NHE6-(537-588) was cloned into pEGFP-C2.Antibodies–Mouse monoclonal anti-Myc IgG (clone 9E10) and mouse monoclonal anti-HA IgG (clone 12CA5) were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Rabbit polyclonal anti-HA IgG was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Mouse monoclonal primary antibodies against α-tubulin (clone DM1A), NHE1 (clone 54), Na+/K+ ATPase α (clone C464.6), and transferrin receptor (clone H68.4) were purchased from Sigma, BD Biosciences, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and Zymed Laboratories, respectively. Anti-RACK1 mouse IgM (clone 20) was purchased from BD Biosciences. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Vector Laboratories. Alexa-488-, Alexa-546-, and Alexa-568-conjugated goat secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal anti-NHE6 and anti-NHE9 antibodies were prepared against isoform-specific sequences in the C terminus. Rabbits were immunized with bacterially expressed fragments of NHE6 (83 amino acids) and NHE9 (68 amino acids), respectively. Antisera were collected and affinity-purified. Conjugation of anti-NHE6 antibody with horseradish peroxidase was performed using the Peroxidase Labeling Kit-NH2 (Dojindo Laboratories).Yeast Two-hybrid Screening–GAL4-based yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using 152 amino acids from the C terminus of human NHE9 as bait. pGBT9-hNHE9Ct-(494-645) was used to screen a human skeletal muscle cDNA library cloned into the GAL4AD-fusion expression vector pACT2 (BD Biosciences). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 strain (MATa, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, his3-200, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2, ura3::MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-lacZ) was co-transformed with pGBT9-hNHE9Ct-494 and the pACT2 cDNA library. Transformants (1.06 × 106) were screened on SD medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose and lacking appropriate nutrients for selection (Leu-, Trp-, Ade-, and His-). Growth-positive clones were isolated, and pACT2 plasmids were retrieved. The cDNA inserts were amplified by PCR using the following primers designed for the flanking region of the pACT2 MCS: forward (5′-CTATTCGATGATGAAGATACCCCACCAAACCC-3′) and reverse (5′-GTGAACTTGCGGGGTTTTTCAGTATCTACGAT-3′). The PCR products were directly subjected to DNA sequencing.Microinjection–NHE9-MycHis was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells cultured on collagen coated glass dishes. Mouse monoclonal anti-Myc IgG in PBS (0.17 μg/μl) was injected into the cytoplasm using a semiautomatic microinjection apparatus, Injectman NI2 and Femtojet (Eppendorf), equipped with Femtotip-II. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. In control experiments, either Myc-VAMP3-EGFP or VAMP3-EGFP-Myc was transiently expressed instead of NHE9-MycHis.Expression and Purification of MBP Fusion Proteins–MBP fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli. E. coli Rosetta-gami transformants were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 4 h. Bacterial cells were harvested, suspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a protease inhibitor mixture, and sonicated five times for 30 s. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was incubated with amylose-resin (New England Biolabs) for 2 h at 4 °C. Resin was washed with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm maltose.Immunoblotting–For the detection of organellar NHEs, cells were lysed in a syringe equipped with a 26-gauge needle. Boiling or heat treatment of the sample was omitted to avoid aggregation of NHEs. When indicated, samples were treated with PNGase F (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions, except boiling of the samples was omitted. Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 7.5% skim milk, hybridized with the indicated primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. After extensive washing in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, immunoreactive signals were visualized with the chemiluminescence-based ECL plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Digital images were recorded using an LAS-1000 instrument (Fuji Film) and analyzed by ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health).Pulldown Assay–COS-7 cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated at 25 °C for 2 h with 2 μg of recombinant MBP fusion protein immobilized to amylose-resin. After extensive washing with lysis buffer, resin fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, and bound RACK1 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-RACK1 IgM.Co-immunoprecipitation–For immunoprecipitation, HeLa cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min, homogenized in a syringe with a 26-gauge needle (20 strokes), and centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and mixed with 10 μl of Protein G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) preincubated with either 2 μg of anti-NHE6 rabbit IgG or normal rabbit IgG. After incubation at 4 °C for 3 h with gentle rotation, beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE. NHE6 and RACK1 were detected by immunoblotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-NHE6 IgG and anti-RACK1 IgM, respectively.Fluorescence Microscopy–For immunostaining, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and then permeabilized in PBS containing 0.4% saponin, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 2% normal goat serum. Cells were then incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h, followed by incubation with the secondary antibody for 1 h. In a competition assay, 0.1 μg/μl MBP-NHE6-(511-669) was added to the primary antibody solution. To visualize the localization of internalized Alexa546-conjugated transferrin (Alexa546-Tfn; Invitrogen), cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 h in serum-free minimum essential medium containing 25 μg/ml Alexa546-Tfn and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The samples were observed using a BX-51 microscope (Olympus) equipped with a ×40 UPlanApo objective (numerical aperture 0.85). Images were acquired with an ORCA-ER1394 digital camera and AQUACOSMOS software (Hamamatsu Photonics).Cell Surface Biotinylation–HeLa cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-ss-biotin in PBS at 4 °C for 20 min. After quenching excessive NHS groups with 0.1 m glycine in PBS and extensive washing with ice-cold PBS, cells were lysed in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysates were homogenized in a 1-ml syringe with a 26-gauge needle (20 strokes) and then centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. Supernatants containing equal amounts of protein were mixed with 100 μl of immobilized Neutravidin beads and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle rotation. Beads were collected by brief centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer. The biotin-labeled surface proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. The intensity of the immunoreactive bands was quantified using Image J.Measurement of Endosomal pH–Fluorescence ratio imaging was performed to measure the endosomal pH according to the previously reported procedure (21Zen K. Biwersi J. Periasamy N. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with modifications. FITC- and Alexa546-conjugated Tfn were purchased from Invitrogen. HeLa cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in serum-free minimum essential medium containing 75 μg/ml FITC-Tfn, 25 μg/ml Alexa546-Tfn, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After extensive washing with Hanks' balanced salt solution (137 mm NaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mm glucose, and 15 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4)), cells were observed using an inverted microscope (IX-70; Olympus) equipped with a ×40 UPlanApo objective (numerical aperture 0.85). Images were acquired using an ORCA-ER1394 digital camera and AQUACOSMOS software. The following interference filter sets were used: band pass 470-495 nm (excitation) and band pass 510-550 nm (emission) for FITC; band pass 530-550 nm (excitation) and long pass >575 nm (emission) for Alexa546. After fixation with 4% formaldehyde, a pH calibration curve was constructed with calibration solutions containing 125 mm KCl, 25 mm NaCl, 5 μm nigericin, and a 25 mm concentration of one of the following buffers: HEPES, pH 7.5 or 7.0, MES, pH 6.5 or 6.0. Fluorescence intensity of the perinuclear recycling endosome was quantified with AQUACOSMOS software, and the ratio of fluorescence intensity (FITC/Alexa546) was calculated after background subtraction. The fluorescence ratio was linear in the range of pH 6.0-7.5. In a single experiment, the endosomal pH values of a random selection of 24 living cells were measured and averaged. Data are shown as the average ± S.E. of six independent experiments.Statistical Analysis–An unpaired two-tailed Student's t test was used for statistical comparisons between RACK1 siRNA- and scramble RNA-treated cells in the measurement of endosomal pH and the quantification of cell surface transferrin receptor and NHE6 amount. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.RESULTSIdentification of RACK1 as an NHE9 Binding Partner–To identify novel interacting proteins of NHE9, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen. A human skeletal muscle cDNA library was screened using the C-terminal 152 amino acids of human NHE9 (residues 494-645) as bait. From the screening of 1.06 × 106 independent clones, 216 positive clones were obtained, and 76 clones were sequenced. Two independent clones (clones 179 and 182) encoding partial fragments of RACK1 were isolated and were investigated further. These two clones displayed NHE9-(494-645)-dependent growth on SD medium lacking histidine and adenine (Fig. 1A). RACK1 consists of seven tandem WD motifs. Each clone contained the C-terminal half of RACK1 (residues 180-317 (clone 179) and residues 148-317 (clone 182)) (Fig. 1B). We next confirmed the interaction using a pulldown assay. The full-length C-terminal fragment, MBP-NHE9-(494-645), clearly bound endogenous RACK1 in a COS-7 lysate (Fig. 2). To further delineate the region responsible for binding, MBP fusion proteins constructed from different segments of the NHE9 C terminus were tested. RACK1 specifically associated with the MBP-NHE9-(494-645), -(528-645), -(494-577), and -(528-577) constructs but not with MBP-NHE9-(494-527), -(578-645), or -Δ(528-577), or with MBP alone. These results suggest that the central region of the NHE9 C-terminal fragment (residues 528-577) is responsible for binding RACK1.FIGURE 2Identification of RACK1 binding domain within the NHE9 C terminus. MBP alone and MBP fusions of various NHE9 segments (MBP-NHE9-(494-645), -(528-645), -(494-527), -(578-645), -(494-577), -(528-577), and -Δ(528-577), shown schematically below) were expressed in E. coli and purified by amyloseagarose resin. Purified proteins (2 μg) were bound to amylase-agarose resin, and incubated with COS-7 cell lysates. Resin-bound fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and RACK1 was analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) with an anti-RACK1 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The C Terminus of NHE9 Is Oriented to the Cytoplasm–Whether the C terminus of mammalian organellar NHEs and their plant and yeast orthologs faces the organellar lumen or the cytoplasm is controversial (22Lin P.J.

The orientation is important, because RACK1, which is a cytoplasmic protein, could only associate with the C terminus of NHE9 if that region of the protein extends into the cytoplasm. To determine the orientation of the NHE9 C terminus, we designed an experiment in which immunostaining was combined with microinjection of antibodies against epitope-tagged proteins (Fig. 3). We used a transmembrane protein of known topology as a control to validate the method. VAMP3 is a type II integral membrane protein predominantly residing in the perinuclear recycling endosomes (28McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 29Bajno L. Peng X.R. Schreiber A.D. Moore H.P. Trimble W.S. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The N terminus of VAMP3 faces the cytoplasm, whereas the C terminus is in the endosome lumen. A Myc tag was fused to either the N or C terminus of an EGFP fusion of human VAMP3 (VAMP3-EGFP) (Fig. 3A), and the protein was then transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. An anti-Myc antibody was injected into the cytoplasm of transfected cells, which were subsequently fixed and stained with fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. The endosomal localization of VAMP3 constructs was confirmed by the EGFP fluorescence at the C terminus, and the topology of the construct was detected by staining with an anti-Myc antibody. As expected, the EGFP and anti-Myc signals overlapped in cells expressing N-terminally (cytoplasmic) tagged Myc-VAMP3-EGFP (Fig. 3B). In contrast, in cells transfected with C-terminally (endosome lumen) tagged VAMP-EGFP-Myc, no intracellular compartment was labeled by the injected anti-Myc. Instead, with longer exposure times, the anti-Myc signal was observed as a uniform staining throughout the cytoplasm, although the EGFP fluorescence clearly localized to the perinuclear recycling endosome (Fig. 3C). This staining pattern is consistent with the injected anti-Myc being unable to access the Myc epitope in the endosomal lumen. These results suggest that cytoplasmically introduced antibody can detect the topology of VAMP3 by recognizing the Myc epitope when present in the cytoplasm but not in the organellar lumen. In cells transiently expressing Myc-His-tagged NHE9 at the C terminus, staining by the microinjected anti-Myc antibody detected end"

Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar). LPS not only functions as a protective barrier preventing cell entry of hydrophobic molecules, including bile salts, detergents, and lipophilic antibiotics, but also helps maintain the structural integrity of the outer membrane. Thus, LPS is vital for bacterial virulence and antibiotic sensitivity in pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. lipopolysaccharide dithiothreitol glucosamine 6-phosphate sedoheptulose-7-phosphate isomerase d-heptose-1,7-bisphosphate phosphatase bifunctional d-β-d-heptose phosphate kinase/d-β-d-heptose 1-phosphate adenyltransferase; Kdo, 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid minimal inhibitory concentration outer membrane polyethylene d-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate selenomethionine N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine root mean square deviation 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. lipopolysaccharide dithiothreitol glucosamine 6-phosphate sedoheptulose-7-phosphate isomerase d-heptose-1,7-bisphosphate phosphatase bifunctional d-β-d-heptose phosphate kinase/d-β-d-heptose 1-phosphate adenyltransferase; Kdo, 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid minimal inhibitory concentration outer membrane polyethylene d-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate selenomethionine N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine root mean square deviation 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. Gram-negative pathogens are increasingly becoming a serious clinical threat. Multidrug-resistant hospital-acquired infections caused by enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and by emerging pathogens of environmental origin such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are the next big problem facing the infectious disease community. Furthermore, Gram-negative pathogens of animal origin such as E. coli O157-H7 are ongoing threats to agriculture and water quality. New chemotherapeutic strategies against Gram-negative bacteria are therefore required. LPS biosynthesis represents a unique Gram-negative target for new antimicrobial intervention. LPS comprises lipid A, a core oligosaccharide, and in some bacteria, an O-specific polysaccharide chain. The core oligosaccharide has an inner core region consisting of 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) and one or more heptose units, and an outer core, consisting of additional sugar residues (Fig. 1A) (reviewed in Refs. 1Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar, 2Nikaido H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2838) Google Scholar, 3Nikaido H. Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Yethon J.A. Whitfield C. Curr. Drug Targets Infect. Disord. 2001; 1: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Lipid A and Kdo are highly conserved in Gram-negative bacteria and essential for cell viability. The biosynthesis of these molecules is therefore a target for traditional antibiotic discovery efforts. Indeed, small molecule inhibitors of lipid A biosynthesis have been reported to have anti-Gram-negative activity (5Onishi H.R. Pelak B.A. Gerckens L.S. Silver L.L. Kahan F.M. Chen M.H. Patchett A.A. Galloway S.M. Hyland S.A. Anderson M.S. Raetz C.R. Science. 1996; 274: 980-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Most Gram-negatives also contain one or more l-glycero-d-manno-heptose molecules attached to the Kdo. Mutants in heptose metabolism, which are viable in laboratory conditions, are avirulent and highly susceptible to antibiotics (reviewed in Ref. 6Valvano M.A. Messner P. Kosma P. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1979-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Heptose biosynthesis is thus a non-traditional target for Gram-negative selective antimicrobial agents. Inhibitors of heptose biosynthesis could be used as anti-virulence drugs or could be co-administered with antibiotics that do not normally cross the outer membrane barrier (e.g. novobiocin and erythromycin) to sensitize bacteria to these agents. We have termed such molecules antibiotic adjuvants (7Wright G.D. Sutherland A.D. Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 260-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The outer core carbohydrates and the O-specific polysaccharide side chains, also known as O-antigens, comprise the remainder of the LPS polymer. These components vary significantly by organism (1Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar). They are not essential for cell growth but do mediate host-microbe interactions and play a significant role in virulence. Inhibitors of outer core and O-antigen biosynthesis could, therefore, be strategically deployed as organismspecific anti-virulence compounds. All levels of LPS biosynthesis represent underexploited targets for new anti-microbial agents. The heptose biosynthetic pathway in Gram-negative bacteria, in particular, is highly attractive being essential for virulence and antibiotic sensitivity. Heptoses targeted to the inner core LPS are synthesized within the cytosol as ADP-activated l-glycero-β-d-manno-heptose molecules (8Kneidinger B. Marolda C. Graninger M. Zamyatina A. McArthur F.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20935-20944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis is initiated from d-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate (S7P). Sedoheptulose-7-phosphate isomerase (GmhA) catalyzes the first committed step in the pathway (Fig. 1B) (11Brooke J.S. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3339-3341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Brooke J.S. Valvano M.A. J. Biol.

In E. coli, phosphorylation at the 1 position of the resulting in d-glycero-α,β-d-manno-heptose 7-phosphate is then catalyzed by the kinase moiety of the bifunctional d-β-d-heptosephosphate kinase/d-β-d-heptose-1-phosphate adenyltransferase (HldE) (14McArthur F. Andersson C.E. Loutet S. Mowbray S.L. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5292-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A bifunctional HldE is also predicted in the opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa based on genomic sequence comparisons. However, in other pathogenic organisms, such as Burkholderia cenocepacia, this bifunctional enzyme is replaced by two distinct enzymes, HldA and HldC, which accomplish the respective functions (6Valvano M.A. Messner P. Kosma P. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1979-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Loutet S.A. Flannagan R.S. Kooi C. Sokol P.A. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2073-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). d-α,β-d-Heptose-1,7-bisphosphate phosphatase (GmhB) catalyzes the removal of the phosphate at the 7 position, whereas the adenyltransferase action of HldE (or mono-functional HldC) transfers the AMP moiety from ATP to give ADP-d-glycero-β-d-manno-heptose (6Valvano M.A. Messner P. Kosma P. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1979-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16Valvano M.A. Marolda C.L. Bittner M. Glaskin-Clay M. Simon T.L. Klena J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Finally, ADP-d-β-D heptose epimerase (HldD) catalyzes the formation of ADP-l-glycero-β-d-manno-heptose, the precursor for the incorporation of heptose into the inner core, which is mediated by specific heptosyltransferases (17Sirisena D.M. MacLachlan P.R. Liu S.L. Hessel A. Sanderson K.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2379-2385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Morrison J.P. Tanner M.E. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3916-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A key step in ADP-heptose biosynthesis is S7P isomerization catalyzed by GmhA. Previous studies of GmhA predicted its function using gene deletion and product analysis (12Brooke J.S. Valvano M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3608-3614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 13Eidels L. Osborn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5642-5648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of gmhA also results in a compromised OM, effectively removing the protective barrier normally afforded by LPS, therefore greatly increasing susceptibility to antibiotics (11Brooke J.S. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3339-3341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the structure and function of GmhA could aid in the future development of inhibitors that would increase the permeability of Gram-negative pathogens and act synergistically with known antibiotics as a novel treatment for Gramnegative infections. We report crystal structures of E. coli and P. aeruginosa GmhA in apo, substrate, and product-bound forms and the use of this structural data to guide site-directed mutagenesis studies that enable prediction of the molecular mechanism of S7P isomerization, a potential target for new antimicrobial agents. Purification of GmhA—Purification of E. coli GmhA followed a previously described protocol (19De Leon G.P. Elowe N.H. Koteva K.P. Valvano M.A. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 437-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). An additional purification step was performed for GmhA protein used in crystallization and analytical ultracentrifugation studies. For these studies, GmhA was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences Bioscience) and eluted using a linear KCl gradient (GmhA buffer A: 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT); GmhA Buffer B: 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 500 mm KCl). Fractions containing only GmhA were pooled and dialyzed extensively against 20 mm HEPES pH 8.0 and 4 mm DTT. P. aeruginosa GmhA was overexpressed in E. coli BL21-Gold (DE3) (Stratagene), harboring an extra plasmid encoding three rare tRNAs (AGG and AGA for Arg and ATA for Ile). Cells were grown in auto-inducible media (20Grossman T.H. Kawasaki E.S. Punreddy S.R. Osburne M.S. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 209: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) for 4-5 h at 37 °C and 12-15 h at 20 °C. Cells were sonicated in binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol, 50 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl), supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and benzamidine and 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma). Clarified lysate was passed in series through DE52 and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) columns. GmhA was dialyzed in 10 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, and concentrated using a BioMax concentrator (Millipore). Selenomethionine (SeMet)-enriched protein was produced according to a previously described procedure (21Qoronfleh M.W. Ho T.F. Brake P.G. Banks T.M. Pulvino T.A. Wahl R.C. Eshraghi J. Chowdhury S.K.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (0.5 mm) was added to all purification buffers. Structure Determination of GmhA—All GmhA crystals were grown at 20 °C using the hanging drop/vapor diffusion method. E. coli GmhA (10 mg/ml) was mixed with an equal volume of crystallization solution (3% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG)-8000, 0.1 m imidazole, pH 7.3, and 3% (v/v) ethylene glycol) and dehydrated against 1.5 m (NH4)2SO4. For crystallization of substrate bound GmhA, S7P (see below) was added at a final concentration of 1 mm, and ethylene glycol was replaced with 1,6-hexandiol. Prior to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen, apo- and substrate-bound GmhA crystals were soaked (∼30-60 s) in a cryo-protecting solution (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 2 mm DTT, 1.5% PEG-8000, 50 mm imidazole, 3% ethylene glycol, 30% glycerol; or 0.5 mm S7P, 15.45 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 3.1 mm DTT, 2.31% PEG-8000, 77.27 mm imidazole, 4.67% 1,6-hexandiol, 30% glycerol, respectively). P. aeruginosa apo-GmhA SeMet crystals grew in a solution of 25% PEG-3350, 0.1 m ammonium sulfate, and 0.1 m Bis-Tris, pH 5.5, and were cryoprotected with a mixture of 8% glycerol, 8% ethylene glycol, and 8% sucrose. Product-bound GmhA crystallized in a solution of 2.5 mm S7P (Sigma), 2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.2 m potassium/sodium tartrate and 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, and were cryoprotected with 25% ethylene glycol. All x-ray diffraction data sets were collected at 100 K. E. coli apo and substrate-bound GmhA data were collected with an R-AXIS IV image-plate detector mounted on an RU300 rotating-anode x-ray generator (Rigaku/MSC Ltd.). Data sets were processed and scaled using d*TREK (23Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar).

Substrate-bound GmhA was solved by molecular replacement using the refined E. coli apo-GmhA structure as a search model. P. aeruginosa SeMet GmhA single wavelength anomolous diffraction data were collected at the 19ID beamline of the Structural Biology Center, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, whereas product-bound GmhA data were collected at the 17ID beamline of the Industrial Macromolecular Crystallography Association Collaborative Access Team. These data were processed with HKL2000 (26Otwinoski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). Using SOLVE (27Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J.

Open table in a new tab GmhA Mutagenesis—Site mutations in E. coli gmhA were generated in both pET28a(+)gmhA and pBAD30gmhA inserts using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). Sequences of mutagenic oligonucleotide primers are described in supplemental Table S1. Mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis (MOBIX, McMaster University) using vector-specific sequencing primers (supplemental Table S1). Sedimentation Equilibrium—E. coli GmhA and GmhA-D94N molecular weights in solution were determined by sedimentation equilibrium analysis using a Beckman-Coulter XL-1 analytical ultracentrifuge (Palo Alto, CA). Protein concentrations corresponding to 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 A280 nm values, respectively, were loaded into a six-channel epon-charcoal cell with a 1.2-cm path length. Equilibrium was allowed to develop for 12-14 h at rotor speeds of 20,000 and 25,000 rpm. The reference solvent contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT (ρ = 1.006 g/ml). Absorbance data were collected at 280 nm and analyzed using the Beckman-Coulter Optima XL-1 Analytical Ultracentrifuge Origin Data Analysis Package (version 60-4) and Microcoal Origin 6.0. GmhA partial specific volume (0.739 ml/g), and solvent densities were determined using SEDNTERP, a public domain program developed by Hayes, Laue, and Philo. Resulting gradients were then fit to a self-association model using the above software. Due to the poor absorption of GmhA, high protein concentrations were required for detection, prohibiting accurate Kd determination. Sedoheptulose 7-Phosphate Synthesis—S7P was synthesized enzymatically from d-serine and ribose 5-phosphate based on the protocol by Lee and colleagues, with minor modifications (34Lee S. Kirschning A. Muller M. Way C. Floss H.G. J. Mol. Catal. B Enzym. 1999; 6: 369-377Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). E. coli transketolase was purified as previously described (19De Leon G.P. Elowe N.H. Koteva K.P. Valvano M.A. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 437-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Porcine d-amino acid oxidase (gift of V. Massey) was purified from E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET28a(+)DAO cells by anion exchange using a Q-Sepharose column. Purified protein was analyzed using 12% SDS-PAGE, and activity was confirmed using a lactate dehydrogenase-coupled enzyme assay (35Fukui K. Momoi K. Watanabe F. Miyake Y. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6693-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). d-amino acid oxidase was stored in the presence of 5 mm FAD. S7P synthesis and purity was determined using liquid chromatography/electrospray mass spectrometry and 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR. E. coli GmhA Steady-state Kinetic Analysis—GmhA activity was monitored by coupling product formation to HldE and GmhB and monitoring Pi release, as previously described (19De Leon G.P. Elowe N.H. Koteva K.P. Valvano M.A. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 437-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The reaction mixture consisted of 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl, 10 mm KCl, 6 mm ATP, 0.4% Tween 20, 0.214 nmol of GmhA, 0.375 nmol of GmhB, 0.094 nmol of HldE, and 0.2 unit of pyrophosphatase in a total volume of 90 μl. Reactions were initiated with 10 μl of S7P for final concentrations ranging from 0 to 2 mm. Initial rates were fit to Equation 1 describing Michaelis-Menten kinetics using Grafit 4 software (Erithacus Software, Staines, UK). ν=kcatEt[S]/(Km+[S])(Eq. 1) GmhA in Vivo Complementation Studies—pBAD30gmhA wild-type and mutant vectors were used to transform E. coli BW25113ΔgmhA cells (36Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M. Datsenko K.A. Tomita M. Wanner B.L. Mori H. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2: 2006-2008Crossref Scopus (5378) Google Scholar) to create complement strains. Positive and negative control strains were created by transforming the pBAD30 vector into E. coli BW25113 and E. coli BW25113ΔgmhA cells, respectively. Cells were cultured overnight at 37 °C, 250 rpm in M9 minimal media, 0.2% arabinose, 100 μg/ml ampicillin. To confirm GmhA expression, 1 ml of overnight culture was harvested, resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA buffer, 50 μl of 2× SDS loading dye. Cells were lysed by boiling 30 min and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. For immunoblot analysis, gel contents were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. GmhA was detected using mouse IgG anti-histidine primary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and peroxidase-conjugated Affini-pure donkey anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson Immuno-Research). PerkinElmer Life Sciences Western lighting chemiluminescence reagent was used in detection. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of novobiocin were determined as follows: Overnight cultures, as described above, were diluted to A600 nm 0.11 and further diluted 1 in 200. Strains were grown at 37 °C in 96-well plates in the presence of varying concentrations of Me2SO-dissolved novobiocin (2-1024 μg/ml). A600 nm was measured after 20 h to assay growth. MIC was determined as the concentration of novobiocin required to reduce the A600 nm of each strain to 90% of the A600 nm in the absence of drug. LPS Analysis—E. coli BW25113 ΔgmhA/pBAD30gmhA wild-type and mutant strains were grown at 37 °C for 24 h on M9 minimal media, 0.2% arabinose, 100 μg/ml ampicillin agar plates. LPS was extracted from these cells as previously described (37Marolda C.L. Lahiry P. Vines E. Saldias S. Valvano M.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 347: 237-252PubMed Google Scholar). LPS samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE in the Tricine buffer system and detected by silver staining (37Marolda C.L. Lahiry P. Vines E. Saldias S. Valvano M.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 347: 237-252PubMed Google Scholar, 38Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2309) Google Scholar). Gels were fixed overnight in 250 ml of fixing solution (60% MeOH, 10% acetic acid). Gels were washed, in order, using 200 ml of 7.5% acetic acid for 30 min, 200 ml of 0.7% periodic acid for 30 min, milliQ H2O for 3 × 15 min, 200 ml of staining solution (42 ml of 0.36% NaOH, 2.8-ml concentrated NH4OH, 8ml of 19.4% silver nitrate, 148 ml of H2O) for 25 min, milliQ H2O for 2 × 15 min, and 200 ml of developing solution (50 mg of citric acid, 0.5 ml of 37% formaldehyde in H2O) until bands appear. Stain development was stopped by repeated washing in H2O. Structural Analysis of GmhA—The crystal structures of apo-GmhA from E. coli and P. aeruginosa were determined to 1.95 Å (PDB 2I2W) and 2.4 Å (PDB 3BJZ), respectively (Table 1). The structure from E. coli was solved via molecular replacement using an initial model based on the GmhA structure from V. cholerae (PDB 1X94). E. coli apo-GmhA crystals grew in the space group P212121 with four molecules of GmhA in each asymmetric unit as shown in Fig. 2 (subunits A, B, C, and D). Analysis of oligomerization using the program PISA (39Krissinel E. Henrick K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6768) Google Scholar) strongly suggested that GmhA would exist in solution as a tetramer. This was further verified by sedimentation equilibrium studies (supplemental Fig. S1). No electron density was observed for residues 83-97 in chains B or D, and therefore these regions are represented as dotted lines in Fig. 2. Three intersubunit Cys-Cys disulfide linkages were observed in the asymmetric unit, one at Cys-90 linking chain A-C, and two others linking Chains A-B and C-D at Cys-57, respectively. These linkages are likely artifacts, because addition of a reducing agent or substitution of Cys to Ser resulted in increased GmhA activity (discussed below). The A-D and B-C dimer interfaces are extensive (2680 Å2), each resulting from reciprocal interactions between helices H1, H3, and H6. A-B and C-D interfaces are less extensive (1515 Å2) and are formed primarily through H4 and reciprocal interactions with loop regions joining H3-β2or β2-H4. The final model was refined to R and Rfree values of 19.2 and 22.4, respectively. Apo-GmhA from P. aeruginosa was crystallized in space group P21212, and the structure was determined to 2.4 Å using SeMet-substituted protein and single-wavelength anomalous diffraction. The final model was refined to R and Rfree values of 19.7 and 27.4, respectively. As with the apo-GmhA structure from E. coli, a tetramer of GmhA was observed in the asymmetric unit and residues 83-96 in each chain were disordered. The Cα traces of these monomers could be superimposed with an r.m.s.d. of 1.1 Å (supplemental Fig. S2). Each GmhA monomer consists of a central five-stranded parallel β-sheet, flanked by five alpha helices (Fig. 2A), forming a three-layered HβH sandwich. Helical layers are composed of H2, H3, and H6 on one side and H4 and H5 on the opposing side of the central β-sheet with top"

Here we show that the MPT regulates the release of cytochrome c for apoptosis during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by remodeling the cristae junction (CJ).

Interference RNA knockdown of Bax blocked OPA1 and cytochrome c release after THG treatment but did not prevent the MPT, showing that Bax was essential for the release of cytochrome c by MPT. In isolated mitochondria, MPT led to OPA1 and cytochrome c release independently of voltage-dependent anion channel and the outer membrane, indicating that the MPT is an inner membrane phenomenon. Last, the MPT was regulated by the electron transport chain but not mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, since THG-induced cell death was not blocked by antioxidants and did not occur in cells lacking mitochondrial DNA.

The role of the MPT in cell death is controversial due, in part, to the current lack of knowledge of its molecular structure and its regulation (7Bernardi P. Krauskopf A. Basso E. Petronilli V.

For example, although recent genetic studies with cyclophilin D (Cyp-D) knock-out mice have shown that the MPT primarily regulates necrosis and not apoptosis (9Nakagawa T. Shimizu S. Watanabe T.

Armstrong J.S. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, early studies suggested that the MPT caused cytochrome c release by inducing nonspecific mitochondrial swelling and organelle rupture (13Petit P.X. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Mignotte B. Kroemer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 14Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Skulachev V.P.

However, in contrast to this idea, other reports have shown that cytochrome c can be released from mitochondria without significant swelling or outer membrane rupture (17Gao W. Pu Y. Luo K.Q. Chang D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Gogvadze V. Robertson J.D. Enoksson M. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Biochem.

Recently, it has been shown that the mitochondrial cytochrome c release mechanism is highly regulated and involves a number of discrete steps (19Ott M. Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1259-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 20Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), including structural remodeling of the mitochondrial cristae junctions (CJ) and outer membrane permeabilization (20Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). The MPT was implicated in remodeling of the CJ, because it was blocked by the MPT inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA) (20Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar); however, the relationship between CJ remodeling and the MPT is currently unknown. Here we show, using isolated mitochondria and leukemic CEM cells, that the MPT induces mitochondrial structural remodeling of the cristae membrane by releasing OPA1 from the CJ to facilitate mitochondrial release of cytochrome c for apoptosis. In cells, the MPT failed to release cytochrome c from mitochondria in the absence of Bax, indicating that the MPT does not rupture the organelle's outer membrane for cytochrome c release. In isolated mitochondria, the MPT caused OPA1 and cytochrome c release independently of the mitochondrial outer membrane and the putative component VDAC. Last, we show that the MPT is dependent on a functional electron transport chain (ETC) but does not depend on mitochondrial ROS production and therefore is not redox-regulated. Materials and Cell CultureAll chemicals, including THG, ruthenium 360 (Ru360), staurosporine (STS), CsA, BAPTA-AM, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and the manganese-superoxide dismutase antioxidant Mn(III)tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin chloride (MnTBAP) were purchased from Sigma. Bongkrekic acid (BGK) was purchased from Calbiochem. Ionomycin (Iono) and tunicamycin (TM) were purchased from AG scientific (San Diego, CA). Fluorescent probes, including tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), Fluo3-AM, Rhod2-AM, propidium iodide, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI) were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). CEM cells were passaged daily to maintain them in log phase growth and kept at a nominal concentration of 2.5-5 × 105/ml. Cell viability studies were performed by the trypan blue exclusion method. CEM parental cells were treated with ethidium bromide in the presence of 110 μg/ml pyruvate and 50 g/ml uridine to generate cells lacking mitochondrial DNA (ρ0) as previously described (21Chua Y.L. Zhang D. Boersterli U. Moore P.K. Whiteman M. Armstrong J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). ρ0 status was determined by monitoring cells for KCN-sensitive oxygen consumption and cytochrome oxidase II subunit protein expression by Western blot until oxygen consumption was reduced 90%. Murine embryo fibroblast (MEF) wild type cells and Bax/Bak double knock-out cells were generously given by Dr. L Scorrano (Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Venice, Italy). HCT116 colon cancer Bax+/- and Bax-/- cells were generously given by Dr. V. Yu (Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Singapore). MEF cells and HCT116 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 1% glutamate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Apoptosis AssaysTHG and STS were used at a concentration of 1 μm and 500 nm, respectively, unless otherwise stated. Cellular apoptosis was determined by performing FACS cell cycle analysis of propidium iodide (20 μg/ml)-stained CEM cells. The percentage of cells in the sub-G1 zone was taken to indicate the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis. DAPI (3 μm) staining was also monitored by fluorescence microscopy to visually estimate cells containing apoptotic nuclei. Caspase-3 activity was determined using the EnzChek® caspase-3 fluorescence assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), using a Molecular Probes fluorometer model GEMINI XS (excitation at 342 nm and emission at 441 nm). Determination of Cytosolic and Mitochondrial Ca2+ LevelsCytosolic Ca2+ levels were determined by FACS analysis using Fluo-3AM (1 μm) (log mode in fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) setting) with results displayed as FACS analysis histograms as described in Ref. 6Zhang D. Armstrong J.S. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar. Mitochondrial Ca2+ levels were determined by FACS analysis using Rhod2-AM (250 nm) (log mode in phycoerythrin (PE) setting) with results displayed as color density dot plots as described in Ref. 6Zhang D. Armstrong J.S. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar. For the spectrophotometric determination of mitochondrial Ca2+, cells were loaded with 1 μm Rhod2-AM in a buffer (100 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2) for 60 min and transferred to primary culture for an additional 18 h to eliminate the residual cytosolic fraction of the Rhod2 dye. Mitochondrial Ca2+ was determined by measuring fluorescence at 552 and 581 nm. For the single cell mitochondrial Ca2+ assay, laser-scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) was used as described previously (6Zhang D. Armstrong J.S. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial localization of the Rhod2 probe was performed by simultaneously loading cells with 100 nm MitoTracker green (a mitochondria-selective dye that is concentrated by active mitochondria) and 300 nm DAPI. Fluorescence images of Rhod2, MitoTracker green, and DAPI were obtained at 552/490/358 nm excitation and 581/516/461 nm emission, respectively. FACS Analysis for Determination of Δψm and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) ProductionΔψm was determined by monitoring the fluorescence of the cationic potentiometric dye TMRM as described previously (6Zhang D.

Briefly, cells were loaded with TMRM (250 nm) for 15 min, and red fluorescence was determined by FACS analysis using the PE setting. Representative results were shown as two-dimensional color density plots of TMRM-stained cells showing the percentage of cells with intact Δψm (TMRM fluorescence in top right quadrant). For semiquantitative determination of Δψm, TMRM (40 nm) fluorescence was monitored in parental CEM ρ+ cells and CEM ρ0 cells before and after treatment with the detergent Nonidet P-40 using a modified Nernst equation, Δψm =-60 mV × log(TMRM fluorescence of control)/(TMRM fluorescence intensity of Nonidet P-40 treatment) (22Pon L.A.

ROS assays were determined using dichlorofluorescein diacetate and dihydroethidine. Representative results of at least five independent experiments are shown. In each analysis, 10,000 events were recorded. Transmission Electron MicroscopyCEM cells in the logarithmic proliferation phase were treated with THG (1 μm) with or without the inhibitors as described in figure legends 1, 2, 3, and 5. Cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, at room temperature for 1 h, washed with 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, postfixed with 1% osmium tetraoxide in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, dehydrated with graded series of ethanol, and embedded in LX112. Thin sections were prepared and stained with uranyl acetate. Specimens were examined on a JEOL 1000X electron microscope operating at 80 kV (6Zhang D. Armstrong J.S.

Cyp-D was determined using rabbit polyclonal anti-Cyp-D antibody (Calbiochem). Bak was determined by goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bcl-2 was determined by mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Mouse monoclonal anti-OPA1, anti-cytochrome c, anti-β-actin, and anti-manganese-superoxide dismutase antibodies were from BD Biosciences, Pharmingen. Chemiluminescence detection was performed using an ECL detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Mitochondrial Isolation and Determination of Large Amplitude SwellingRat liver mitochondria were isolated by conventional differential centrifugation from the livers of male adult Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (6Zhang D. Armstrong J.S. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Isolated rat liver mitochondria were incubated in isolation buffer (200 mm sucrose, 20 μm EGTA, 5 mm succinate, 2 μm rotenone, 1 μg/ml oligomycin, 20 mm Tris, 20 mm HEPES, and 1 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2). EGTA (1 mm) was used to prevent MPT. For the MPT experiments, EGTA was omitted from the buffers, and 200 μm Ca2+/mg of protein was used to induce large amplitude swelling, which was measured by recording absorbance measurements at 540 nm every 10 s for a total of 8 min (6Zhang D.

At the end of the incubation period, mitochondrial suspensions were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatants were used for Western blot analysis for OPA1 and cytochrome c. Digitonin (DIG) (100 pmol/mg protein)-treated mitochondria was incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were Western blotted for the indicated protein (20Scorrano L.

Proteinase K digestion of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins, including VDAC, was used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Oxygen consumption was measured with a Clark oxygen electrode (Oxygraph model 5300; Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Yellow Springs, OH) as described previously (6Zhang D. Armstrong J.S.

Mitochondria were energized with 5 mm succinate, and respiratory control ratios were calculated after the addition of 200 μm ADP. Bax and Cyp-D Gene Silencing with Small Interference RNAs (siRNAs)Gene silencing with siRNAs (sense and antisense strands) were purchased from 1st Base.

Analysis of variance was used for significance testing (p < 0.05). MPT Activation Induces the Co-release of OPA1 and Cytochrome c from Isolated Mitochondria and from Mitochondria in SituSince structural remodeling of the CJ is sensitive to CsA (20Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) and is accompanied by the mitochondrial release of the OPA1 protein (23Frezza C. Cipolat S. Martins de Brito O. Micaroni M. Beznoussenko G.V. Rudka T. Bartoli D. Polishuck R.S. Danial N.N. De Strooper B. Scorrano L. Cell. 2006; 126: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar), which allows for the complete release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (24Arnoult D. Grodet A. Lee Y.J. Estaquier J. Blackstone C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35742-35750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), an initial aim for this study was to determine the relationship between the MPT and structural remodeling of the CJ for cytochrome c release from mitochondria. We determined the release of OPA1 and cytochrome c from rat liver mitochondria after Ca2+ treatment to induce the MPT. Fig. 1A shows a representative example of Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling profile of rat liver mitochondria. Mitochondrial swelling was inhibited by MPT inhibitors CsA, BGK, and Ru360. The amount of OPA1 and cytochrome c released into the incubation buffer after MPT was determined. Results indicated that both proteins were co-released from mitochondria in an MPT-dependent manner, since their release was blocked by CsA, BGK, and Ru360, inhibitors of the MPT (Fig. 1B). We next determined whether the MPT in cells would cause the co-release of both OPA1 and cytochrome c. CEM cells were treated with THG with or without CsA, BGK, and Ru360 and mitochondrial Ca2+ levels, Δψm (as an indicator of MPT activation), and cytosolic OPA1 and cytochrome c were determined. THG treatment increased mitochondrial Ca2+ levels (blocked by Ru360 but not CsA or BGK), reduced the percentage of cells displaying Δψm, and caused loss of mitochondrial cristae structure blocked by MPT inhibitors (Fig. 1C). THG treatment also caused OPA1 and cytochrome c release from mitochondria of CEM cells blocked by MPT inhibitors (Fig. 1D). Overall, these results indicated that the Ca2+-induced MPT caused co-release of OPA1 and cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria and mitochondria in situ, suggesting that the MPT controls remodeling of the CJ for cytochrome c release. Cyp-D Regulates the Release of OPA1 and Cytochrome c during THG-dependent ApoptosisSince pharmacological inhibitors are nonspecific, siRNA was used to knock down the MPT component Cyp-D to confirm the role of the MPT in the release of OPA1 and cytochrome c from mitochondria induced by THG. STS was used as a control, since genetic studies have demonstrated that STS-induced apoptosis is not Cyp-D-regulated (9Nakagawa T. Shimizu S. Watanabe T. Yamaguchi O. Otsu K. Yamagata H. Inohara H. Kubo T. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 2005; 434: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, 10Baines C.P. Kaiser R.A. Purcell N.H. Blair N.S. Osinska H. Hambleton M.A. Brunskill E.W. Sayen M.R. Gottlieb R.A. Dorn G.W. Robbins J. Molkentin J.D. Nature. 2005; 434: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). Cyp-D siRNA effectively reduced Cyp-D expression ∼90% compared with scramble control siRNA or untreated cells (Fig. 2A, top left) and blocked the mitochondrial release of OPA1 and cytochrome c in response to THG (Fig. 2A, top right); however, as expected, Cyp-D knockdown did not block OPA1 and cytochrome c release in response to STS (Fig. 2A, bottom). Δψm and mitochondrial cristae ultrastructure were determined in parental CEM and Cyp-D knockdown cells before and after treatment with THG and STS. Cyp-D knockdown blocked loss of Δψm and mitochondrial cristae ultrastructure after treatment with THG but not STS (Fig. 2, B and C). Cyp-D knockdown also prevented caspase-3 processing and the increase in fraction of apoptotic cells after THG treatment but not STS treatment (Fig. 2D). The indispensable role of Cyp-D in the co-release of OPA1 and cytochrome c was not stimulus- or cell type-specific, since Cyp-D knockdown blocked cytochrome c and OPA1 release caused by other ER stress inducers, including Iono and TM (Fig. 2E, top) and by THG in other cell types, including MEF cells and HCT116 cells (Fig. 2E, middle and bottom). The MPT and Bax Are Required for the Release of OPA1 and Cytochrome c from MitochondriaThe mechanism of cytochrome c release from mitochondria by the MPT has been suggested to involve matrix swelling and organelle rupture (13Petit P.X. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Mignotte B. Kroemer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 14Green D.R. Reed J.C.

Weiss J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47524-47529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, Bax is also known to play a role in apoptosis by providing a channel for the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol (27Appleby R.D. Porteous W.K. Hughes G. James A.M. Shannon D. Wei Y.H. Murphy M.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and we have recently shown that both Bax and the MPT are involved in the regulation of ER stress-induced apoptosis (6Zhang D. Armstrong J.S. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether the MPT was sufficient for cytochrome c release, as predicted by the matrix swelling model, we silenced Bax expression and then induced the MPT by treating Bax knockdown CEM cells with THG. Bax siRNA effectively reduced Bax expression ∼90% compared with scramble control siRNA or untreated cells but did not significantly change the levels of Bak and Bcl-2 (Fig. 3A). In Bax knockdown cells, THG treatment caused CsA-sensitive loss of Δψm and loss of normal mitochondrial cristae ultrastructure, indicating that THG treatment induced the MPT in Bax knockdown cells (Fig. 3B). However, after Bax knockdown, THG treatment did not release mitochondrial OPA1 and cytochrome c compared with parental CEM cells (Fig. 3C), indicating that the MPT did not induce mitochondrial rupture and cytochrome c release but required Bax for this function. Bax knockdown also prevented caspase-3 processing and the increase in fraction of apoptotic cells after THG treatment (Fig. 3D). Cytochrome c and OPA1 release induced by Iono and TM was blocked by Bax knockdown (Fig. 3E, top), and we did not observe the co-release induced by THG in HCT116 Bax-/- cells and MEF Bax/Bak DKO cells (Fig. 3E, middle and bottom), suggesting that the requirement of MPT and Bax for the co-release of OPA1 and cytochrome c is a universal mechanism. OPA1 and Cytochrome c Release from Isolated Mitochondria Occurs Independently of VDAC and the Mitochondrial Outer MembraneSince our model suggested that the MPT regulated the structure of the cristae and CJ (i.e. the mitochondrial inner membrane), we considered that outer membrane VDAC might not be a necessary component of the MPT, as previously suggested (25Crompton M. Virji S. Ward J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were first treated with proteinase K to remove the VDAC by digestion (26Tan K.O. Fu N.Y. Sukumaran S.K. Chan S.L. Kang J.H. Poon K.L. Chen B.S. Yu V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14623-14628Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and then treated with Ca2+ to induce MPT. Mitochondrial swelling profiles before and after proteinase K treatment were monitored (Fig. 4A). We observed no significant difference either between the mitochondrial swelling profiles or the quantity of OPA1 and cytochrome c released into the incubation buffer before or after proteinase K treatment (Fig. 4, A and B). Mitochondria were next preincubated with DIG at concentrations previously found to remove the outer membrane (6Zhang D. Armstrong J.S.

Mitochondrial swelling profiles before and after DIG treatment were monitored (Fig. 4C). We observed no significant difference either between the mitochondrial swelling profiles or the quantity of OPA1 and cytochrome c released into the incubation buffer before or after DIG treatment (Fig. 4, C and D, bottom).

However, Vif leads to their degradation and counteracts their effects. Another member, A3A, restricts some retrotransposons and another virus but not HIV. We reasoned that this failure was due to the lack of appropriate targeting. Thus, we fused A3A to another viral protein, Vpr, which binds p6 in Gag and is incorporated into viral cores. Indeed, the Vpr.A3A chimera but not A3A was found abundantly in the viral core. It also restricted potently the replication of HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus in the presence and absence of Vif. Because we identified a high frequency of G to A mutations in viral cDNAs, this antiviral activity was mediated by DNA editing. Interestingly, our fusion protein did not restrict murine leukemia virus, which does not incorporate Vpr. Thus, by targeting appropriately a potent single domain cytidine deaminase, we rendered HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus restriction resistant to Vif.

Although some of these factors can interfere with the replication of HIV, 3The abbreviations used are: HIVhuman immunodeficiency virusA3APOBEC3 proteinsA3AAPOBEC3AA3GAPOBEC3GA3CAPOBEC3CA3FAPOBEC3FVpr.A3AVpr and APOBEC3A fusion proteinCDAcytidine deaminaseMLVmurine leukemia virusSIVsimian immunodeficiency virusVSV-Gvesicular stomatitis virus glycoproteinMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidVprviral protein RGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutininWTwild typeVifviral infectivity factorRTreverse transcriptase. viral proteins can counteract them. The ability of members of the APOBEC3 (A3) family of cytidine deaminases (CDAs) to confer intrinsic immunity to retroviral infection was first recognized with the human A3G protein (2Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C. Choi J.D. Malim M.H. Nature. 2002; 418: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). A3G is packaged into newly synthesized viral particles from producer cells and acts in target cells to inhibit viral replication during reverse transcription. In humans, the APOBEC family includes AID, A1, A2, A3A–A3H, and A4 (3Holmes R.K. Malim M.H. Bishop K.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 118-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). All proteins in this family have one or two CDA motifs that contain one histidine, two cysteines, and one glutamic acid that are involved in the hydrolytic deamination of cytosines, thereby converting cytidine (C) to uridine (U) in a process called editing (for review in Ref. 3Holmes R.K. Malim M.H. Bishop K.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 118-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Indeed, G to A changes observed in viral sequences from HIV-infected patients can be explained by direct C to U transitions in the minus-strand cDNA by CDAs (4Kieffer T.L. Kwon P. Nettles R.E. Han Y. Ray S.C. Siliciano R.F. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 1975-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, because mutant A3G proteins lacking the CDA activity retain substantial antiviral effects, the mechanism of this intrinsic restriction is not fully understood (5Newman E.N. Holmes R.K.

Although A3F and A3G can restrict the replication of HIV, this inhibition is overcome by the viral infectivity factor (Vif). Thus, primate lentiviruses have developed an escape strategy to prevent the incorporation of A3 proteins into progeny virions (7Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C. Malim M.H. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Vif acts as an adaptor protein, which connects A3F and A3G to an E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby inducing the polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of these CDAs (8Yu X. Yu Y. Liu B. Luo K. Kong W. Mao P. Yu X.F. Science. 2003; 302: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). As a consequence, A3F and A3G are unavailable for subsequent incorporation into viral particles, and their antiviral effects are absent in target cells. Anti-viral effects of A3 proteins are not limited to Vif-deficient forms of HIV but also extend to other lentiviruses, including SIV, the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), and more distant retroviruses such as the murine leukemia virus (MLV), foamy viruses, and the mouse mammary tumor virus as well as endogenous retroviruses and retrotransposons (9Chiu Y.L.

Tissue Cultures—The human embryonic kidney cell line 293T and GHOST R3/X4/R5 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

Plasmids—HIV proviral plasmids pNL43-Luc and pNL43-LucΔVif were described before (26Zheng Y.H. Irwin D. Kurosu T. Tokunaga K. Sata T. Peterlin B.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6073-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The full-length, envelope-defective SIVmac reporter virus (pSIVmac-Luc E–R– and pSIVmac-Luc E–R– Δvif) were kindly provided by Dr. Nathaniel Landau (27Mariani R. Chen D. Schrofelbauer B. Navarro F.

HIV and SIVmac clones encoded luciferase in place of the nef gene. Expression vectors encoding the B-tropic MLV Gag-Pol proteins have been described previously (28Towers G. Bock M. Martin S. Takeuchi Y. Stoye J.P. Danos O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12295-12299Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). They were used to package MLV-based vectors encoding GFP in place of env but lacking Gag and Gag-Pol genes (pCNCG, Oxford Biomedica). The B-tropic MLV vectors were obtained from Dr. Paul D. Bieniasz. Reporter viruses lacking env were generated as vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotypes. To construct the Vpr.A3A fusion protein, the human A3A was fused to the C terminus of Vpr in the context of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO (Invitrogen) (Fig. 1A). First, the vpr gene was amplified by PCR using a 5′-primer located before the initiation codon (ATG) of Vpr and 3′-primer at the end of the vpr gene of pNL43 proviral clone (Vpr forward primer, 5′-CAC CAT GGA ACA AGC CCC AGA AGA CCA A-3′; VprGlyClaI reverse primer, 5′-CCC ATC GAT GGG ACC ACC TCC GCC TGT CGA CAC CCA ATT CTG-3′). At the 3′ site of Vpr gene, a linker of four glycines and the ClaI restriction site were introduced, and the VprGly fragment was cloned into pcDNA3.1-V5 TOPO. Next, a PCR-amplified A3A DNA fragment flanked by ClaI and XbaI restriction sites at 5′ and 3′ termini, respectively (ClaIA3Af, 5′-CCC ATC GAT GGG ATG GAA GCC AGC CCA GCA TCC GGG-3′; A3AXbaIrev, 5′-GCT CTA GAG TTT CCC TGA TGG CCC GCA GCC TCC CAC TCA-3′) was amplified from pKA3A vector previously described (18Bogerd H.P. Wiegand H.L. Doehle B.P. Lueders K.K. Cullen B.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), digested with ClaI and XbaI enzymes, and ligated into pcDNA3.1-VprGly vector digested with the same enzymes. In addition, other plasmid constructions were used as controls. The Vpr.Nef fusion protein (pEF.Myc.Vpr.Nef) was described before (29Costa L.J. Chen N. Lopes A. Aguiar R.S. Tanuri A. Plemenitas A. Peterlin B.M. Retrovirology. 2006; 3: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The Vpr expressing vector was constructed as described above, and the Vpr gene was inserted in the pcDNA3.1-V5 TOPO (pcDNA3.1 Vpr). Mammalian expression vectors for human A3C, A3F, and A3G (26Zheng Y.H. Irwin D. Kurosu T. Tokunaga K. Sata T. Peterlin B.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6073-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) were subcloned into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO. The pkA3A vector expressing hA3A HA-tagged protein was a gift of Dr. Brian Cullen. All constructions were checked by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing with cytomegalovirus and bovine growth hormone primers. Viral Production and Infectivity Assay—HIV viruses were produced by transfection of pNL43 Luc vectors (8 μg) with 4 μg of each vector expressing APOBEC, Vpr, or Vpr.Nef fusion proteins. Reporter viruses (SIVmac and B-Tropic MLV) were generated as VSV-G pseudotypes by co-transfection of 293T cells in 10-cm dishes with 8 μg of proviral plasmid DNA, 4 μgof VSV-G, and 4 μg of APOBEC expression vector or the controls plasmids (pcDNA3.1 Vpr or pEF.Myc.Vpr.Nef) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). B-tropic MLV viruses were generated using an MLV-based vector encoding GFP in place of env, an expression vector B-tropic MLV Gag-Pol protein (28Towers G. Bock M. Martin S. Takeuchi Y. Stoye J.P. Danos O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12295-12299Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), the pVSV-G vector and the A3 and control vectors in the proportion 1:1:0.5:0.5, respectively. Viruses in the supernatant were collected after 48 h of transfection and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and the viral titers were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit against p24 (Roche Applied Science) or p27 (RETRO-TEK; ZeptoMetrix). Equal amounts of HIV-1 and SIVmac were used to infect GHOST-R3/X4/R5 cells in six-well plates. 24 h later cells were lysed in CAT lysis buffer (Promega). After removing the nuclei, the cytosolic fraction was used to determine the luciferase activity using a luciferase assay kit (Promega). MLV infectivity assays were done in six-well plates seeded with GHOST-R3/X4/R5 cells per well the day before infection. 48 h post-infection, the target cells were assayed for GFP expression by fluorescence microscopy, then harvested by trypsinization and resuspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. An aliquot was used for flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences), and the data were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems). Uninfected control cells were also processed as described above. Infectivity assays were done in triplicate; each assay was performed three times with similar results. Values are presented as the percentage of infectivity relative to the virus infectivity in the absence of A3 vectors. A3 Encapsulation and Isolation of HIV Cores—Normalized amounts of virus were pelleted by ultracentrifugation through 20% sucrose cushion at 45,000 rpm for 1 h (Beckman), 4 °C. Cell lysates and pelleted virions were solubilized in 10 μl of HEPES lysis buffer. Virion cores were obtained using previously published methods (30Soros V.B. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, viral pellets from the cushion of 20% sucrose ultracentrifugation were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (3.5 μl/ml of initial culture volume). Subsequently, 40 μl of fresh virus suspension was mixed with an equal volume of 200 mm NaCl, 100 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), and virions were lysed for 2 min at room temperature by adding Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.5%. HIV cores were recovered by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at full speed (14,000 rpm) for 8 min at 4 °C. Pellets were washed twice with 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) and resuspended in 8 μl of the same buffer. Cores and supernatants were processed immediately for further analysis. Cores and supernatants were then analyzed by immunoblotting to evaluate the efficiency of core isolation. The HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) (8C4), HIV gp41 (no. 50–69), and HIV p24 monoclonal antibodies (183-H12-5C) were obtained from National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. To examine A3 and Vpr packaging, purified virions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using α-V5-horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Invitrogen) for Vpr.A3A, Vpr, A3G, and A3F proteins and α-HA monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) for A3A protein and the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by detection with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Detection of Hypermutation in Viral DNA—35-mm subconfluent monolayers of GHOST R3/X4/R5 cells were infected with 4 ng of p24 wild-type HIV virus produced in the presence or absence of the Vpr.A3A fusion protein in 12 h. Total cellular DNA was purified using the DNeasy kit (Qiagen), treated with DpnI for 2 h at 37°C to digest any residual plasmid DNA, and subjected to high fidelity PCR (Expand High Fidelity PCR system, Roche Applied Science) using HIV-specific oligonucleotides U3 R (forward) 5′-CAG ATA TCC ACT GAC CTT TGG-3′ and U3 R (reverse) 5′-GAG GCT TAA GCA GTG GGT TC-3′. The PCR products were cloned into pCR4-TOPO (TOPO TA cloning kit for sequencing, Invitrogen) and used to transfect Escherichia coli (DH5α). Plasmids were purified from at least 10 individual colonies, and the insert (417-bp) was sequenced using T3 and T7 primers. The nucleotide sequences of independent clones were aligned and analyzed using Hypermut software (31Rose P.P. Korber B.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 400-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Vpr.A3A Chimera Blocks the Replication of HIV and Is Incorporated into Viral Particles—To target A3A into the cores of HIV, we constructed a number of plasmid effectors that are depicted in Fig. 1A (effectors). For the expression of the Vpr.A3A chimera, A3A was subcloned from pkA3A expression vector, and Vpr was amplified by PCR from the HIV-1NL4-3 provirus (Fig. 1B, targets). They were ligated in-frame and introduced into the pcDNA3.1-V5 expression vector. Thus, our fusion protein also contained the V5 epitope tag at its C terminus. Control plasmid effectors, e.g. those expressing the Vpr.Nef chimera, or just Vpr or A3A alone are also presented in Fig. 1A. To determine whether the Vpr.A3A chimera possessed any antiviral activity, we used the wild type (WT) (NL43Luc, HIV) and mutant HIV-1NL4-3 lacking Vif (NL43ΔVifLuc, HIVΔVif) luciferase proviral targets (Fig. 1B, targets). These targets were co-expressed with different A3 proteins or Vpr in 293T cells. Supernatants were harvested and purified, and amounts of viral particles were determined by p24 capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Equal amounts of different HIVs were then used to infect GHOST R3/X4/R5 (GHOST) cells. The infectivity of our viruses was determined by measurements of intracellular luciferase activities 2 days later. As presented in Fig. 2A, lane 2, the Vpr.A3A chimera blocked the WT HIV and mutant HIVΔVif to background levels (greater than 10-fold reduction compared with the control; lane 1). In contrast, A3A had no effect on the WT HIV or mutant HIVΔVif (Fig. 2A, lane 3). The reduced infectivity of viruses which were produced in the presence of A3G and A3C was consistent with previous reports (13Bishop K.N. Holmes R.K. Sheehy A.M. Davidson N.O. Cho S.J. Malim M.H. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1392-1396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Briefly, A3G was sufficient to reduce the infectivity of only HIVΔVif to close to background levels (Fig. 2A, lane 5). A3C weakly inhibited only the mutant HIVΔVif (1.6-fold) (Fig. 2A, lane 4). Moreover, the presence of Vpr alone did not influence viral infectivity (Fig. 2A, lane 6). To exclude the possibility that the reduction of viral infectivity was due to a Vpr-based fusion protein, we also co-expressed the virus and the Vpr.Nef chimera (Fig. 2A, lane 7). Again this fusion protein did not interfere with viral replication, validating our results with the Vpr.A3A chimera. We conclude that the Vpr.A3A chimera blocks the replication of HIV and is not inactivated by Vif. To evaluate the incorporation efficiencies of A3A and the Vpr.A3A chimera, the same aliquots of viruses and producer cells were subjected to Western blotting. Virions were pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion and normalized to levels of p24, and their protein profiles were examined in parallel (Fig. 2B). A3A and the Vpr.A3A chimera were identified using α-HA and α-V5 antibodies, respectively. Our fusion protein had an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa, consistent with the combined sizes of Vpr and A3A (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). Moreover, Western blotting confirmed that our chimera was packaged efficiently into WT HIV and mutant HIVΔVif particles (Fig. 2B, upper panel, lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, A3A was also incorporated into progeny virions (Fig. 2B, upper panel, lanes 5 and 6). However, it did not affect the infectivity of HIV (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Most likely, this incorporation was outside the ribonucleoprotein complex or the core (30Soros V.B. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Equal loading of virions on these blots was confirmed with antibodies against p24 (Fig. 2B, middle panel, lanes 1–6). These results indicate that the Vpr.A3A fusion protein is incorporated efficiently into viral particles where it restricts the infectivity of HIV. In contrast, because A3A had no effect, this finding suggests that the targeting via Vpr was responsible for the antiviral effects of our chimera. Vpr.A3A Chimera Induces Extensive G to A Changes in the Viral Genome—Because the Vpr.A3A chimera blocked viral replication, we wanted to know if DNA editing was involved. To this end, we analyzed sequences of viral reverse transcripts from newly infected cells. WT HIV was co-expressed with the Vpr.A3A chimera in 293T cells, normalized to levels of p24, treated with DpnI to remove contaminating plasmid DNA, and then used to infect GHOST cells. 12 h later a fragment of U3 R was amplified and cloned. Nucleotide sequences were determined for at least 10 independent clones from each infection. In cells infected with the WT HIV in the presence of the Vpr.A3A chimera, we found a total of 62 G to A transitions distributed over 125 dG residues in 10 sequences (4170 bp) yielding a mutation frequency of 1.5 per 100 bases (Fig. 3A, left panel, black bars). Only a single non-G-to-A change was found in the same 10 sequences (Fig. 3A, left panel, lollipop). Levels of mutations were high in comparison to those with the WT HIV in the absence of the Vpr.A3A chimera and were similar to those described previously (32Harris R.S. Bishop K.N. Sheehy A.M. Craig H.M. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Watt I.N. Neuberger M.S. Malim M.H. Cell. 2003; 113: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found just one change (T to C) in 10 sequences analyzed (4170 bp) for a mutation frequency of 0.02 per 100 bases (Fig. 3A, right panel, lollipop). To reveal the base preference for this DNA editing, we analyzed an additional 62 G to A mutations generated in the presence of the Vpr.A3A chimera. The spectrum of mutations revealed that our chimera targets dC residues that are preceded by dC or dT (Fig. 3B, rows C and T). This target specificity agrees with previous reports, where A3A mutated dCs preceded by dC or dT (19Chen H. Lilley C.E. Yu Q. Lee D.V. Chou J. Narvaiza I. Landau N.R. Weitzman M.D. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 480-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). We conclude that the Vpr.A3A chimera has the ability to promote editing of cytidines in the minus strand of viral reverse transcripts and, consequently, to inhibit the replication of HIV. Vpr.A3A Chimera Inhibits SIV Infection—These findings raised the possibility that the Vpr.A3A chimera could restrict the replication of other retroviruses. To investigate this notion, we evaluated the effects of our chimera on the replication of SIV. In these experiments we produced WT SIVmac-Luc-E– R– (SIV) and mutant pSIVmac-Luc-E– R– Δvif (SIVΔVif) viruses in the presence of the Vpr.A3A chimera and other proteins as in Fig. 2A. Luciferase reporter viruses were pseudotyped with the VSV-G Env in the presence of different A3 proteins in 293T cells. As with HIV, the infectivity of these viruses was determined by infecting GHOST cells. Equivalent amounts of viruses, as determined by p27 capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were used, and luciferase activities were measured 2 days later. In addition to inhibiting the infectivity of HIV, the Vpr.A3A chimera also inhibited potently the infection by SIV (Fig. 4A). As presented in lane 2 of Fig. 4A, viral infectivity was inhibited 6-fold by our chimera in the presence and absence of Vif. In contrast, the co-expression of A3A had no effect (Fig. 4A, lane 3). A3C exhibited more potent antiviral effects on the mutant SIVΔVif than on the mutant HIVΔVif, as reported previously (33Yu Q. Chen D. Konig R. Mariani R. Unutmaz D. Landau N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53379-53386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Again, the presence of Vpr and the Vpr.Nef chimera had no effect, validating the antiviral restriction of the Vpr.A3A chimera on SIV. To extend our analyses, we also investigated the incorporation of A3A proteins into SIV particles. In Fig. 4B, Western blotting of producer cells and virions from supernatants revealed the presence of A3A and the Vpr.A3A chimera in producer cells and viral particles (Fig. 4B, top and bottom panel, lanes 3–6). Input viruses are presented in the middle panel and were identified by antibodies against p27. We conclude that the incorporation of our chimera into viral particles restricts the infectivity of SIV irrespective of Vif, suggesting that the Vpr.A3A fusion protein also possesses broad antiviral activity against other primate lentiviruses. Vpr.A3A Chimera Does Not Restrict the Replication of MLV—Results of antiviral restriction of HIV and SIV by the Vpr.A3A chimera were somewhat surprising in light of effects of A3A, which had no effect on the infectivity of these viruses. Thus, we wanted to examine our chimera with MLV, which does not incorporate Vpr (34Kondo E. Mammano F. Cohen E.A. Gottlinger H.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether MLV is sensitive to the Vpr.A3A fusion protein, VSV-G-pseudotyped B-tropic MLV-enhanced GFP reporter viruses were co-expressed with different A3 proteins in 293T cells (28Towers G. Bock M. Martin S. Takeuchi Y. Stoye J.P. Danos O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12295-12299Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Virions were harvested, normalized to p30, and used to infect GHOST cells as with HIV and SIV (Figs. 2 and 4). To follow their infectivity, the number of GFP-positive cells was determined by FACS. As presented in Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 3, neither A3A nor our chimera inhibited the infection by MLV. Controls with other A3 proteins (Fig. 5A, lanes 4 and 5) demonstrated a potent suppression of MLV infection by A3G but no A3F (13Bishop K.N. Holmes R.K. Sheehy A.M. Davidson N.O. Cho S.J. Malim M.H. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1392-1396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Moreover, Vpr alone had no effect (Fig. 5A, lane 6). Thus, neither the Vpr.A3A chimera nor A3A restricted the replication of MLV. Next, we wanted to determine whether MLV could package A3A proteins into progeny virions. For this purpose we performed high speed centrifugation through a sucrose cushion to collect viral particles. Western b"
https://openalex.org/W2076814775,"Mammalian cells maintain the phospholipid compositions of their different membranes remarkably constant. Beside de novo synthesis, degradation, and intracellular trafficking, acyl chain remodeling plays an important role in phospholipid homeostasis. However, many key details of this process remain unresolved, largely because of limitations of existing methodologies. Here we describe a novel approach that allows one to study metabolism of individual phospholipid species in unprecedented detail. Forty different phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) or -serine (PS) species with a deuterium-labeled head group were synthesized and introduced to BHK21 or HeLa cells using cyclodextrin-mediated transfer. Their metabolism was then monitored in detail by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Atypical PE and PS species were rapidly remodeled at both sn1 and sn2 position, yielding a molecular species profile similar to that the endogenous PE and PS. In contrast, remodeling of exogenous species identical or similar to major endogenous ones was more limited and much slower. Major differences in remodeling pathways and kinetics were observed between species within a class, as well as between corresponding PE and PS species. These data along with those obtained with pharmacological inhibitors strongly suggest that multiple lipid class-specific A-type phospholipases and acyl transferases are involved in aminophospholipid remodeling. In conclusion, the approach described here provides highly detailed information on remodeling of exogenously added (amino)glycerophospholipids and should thus be very helpful when elucidating the proteins and processes maintaining molecular species homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1964064096,"The bacterial respiratory nitric-oxide reductase (NOR) is a member of the superfamily of O2-reducing, proton-pumping, heme-copper oxidases. Even although nitric oxide reduction is a highly exergonic reaction, NOR is not a proton pump and rather than taking up protons from the cytoplasmic (membrane potential-negative) side of the membrane, like the heme-copper oxidases, NOR derives its substrate protons from the periplasmic (membrane potential-positive) side of the membrane. The molecular details of this non-electrogenic proton transfer are not yet resolved, so in this study we have explored a role in a proposed proton pathway for a conserved surface glutamate (Glu-122) in the catalytic subunit (NorB). The effect of substituting Glu-122 with Ala, Gln, or Asp on a single turnover of the reduced NOR variants with O2, an alternative and experimentally tractable substrate for NOR, was determined. Electron transfer coupled to proton uptake to the bound O2 is severely and specifically inhibited in both the E122A and E122Q variants, establishing the importance of a protonatable side chain at this position. In the E122D mutant, proton uptake is retained but it is associated with a significant increase in the observed pKa of the group donating protons to the active site. This suggests that Glu-122 is important in defining this proton donor. A second nearby glutamate (Glu-125) is also required for the electron transfer coupled to proton uptake, further emphasizing the importance of this region of NorB in proton transfer. Because Glu-122 is predicted to lie near the periplasmic surface of NOR, the results provide strong experimental evidence that this residue contributes to defining the aperture of a non-electrogenic “E-pathway” that serves to deliver protons from the periplasm to the buried active site in NOR.

Under anaerobic conditions some bacteria can use nitrate instead of oxygen as their terminal electron acceptor in a process called denitrification, in which nitrate is reduced stepwise via nitrite, nitric oxide, and nitrous oxide to dinitrogen.

Bacterial nitric-oxide reductases (NOR) are integral membrane proteins, purified as one- or two-subunit complexes.

NorB is the catalytic subunit and harbors a low spin heme b, a high spin heme b3, and a non-heme iron, FeB, which is presumed to take the place of CuB found in the active site of HCuOs (6Hendriks J.

Because electrons are supplied to NorBC from the cytochrome bc1 complex via soluble donors in the periplasm, the lack of electrogenicity means that the protons required by these reactions must also be derived from the periplasm. Consequently, NOR must contain a proton transfer pathway leading from the periplasmic side of the membrane into the catalytic site (see Fig. 1). The molecular nature of the proton uptake route is not known, but one was recently suggested based on a three-dimensional model of the NorB subunit and the conservation of protonatable residues within this subunit (11Reimann J. Flock U. Lepp H. Honigmann A. Ädelroth P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 362-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, searches for residues conserved in NOR, but not present in all HCuOs, identified five glutamate residues, some of which may be involved in proton movements (12Butland G. Spiro S. Watmough N.J. Richardson D.J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These glutamates are found at positions 122, 125, 198, 202, and 267, 4Numbering refers to the P. denitrificans NorB sequence.4Numbering refers to the P. denitrificans NorB sequence. and they have been individually mutated to non-protonatable residues (8Thorndycroft F.H.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Those residues that are both essential for normal steady-state activity and form part of the proposed proton input pathway are Glu-122, Glu-125, Glu-198, and Glu-267. Both topological and three-dimensional models of NorB (11Reimann J. Flock U. Lepp H. Honigmann A. Ädelroth P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 362-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Kannt A. Michel H. Cheesman M.R. Thomson A.J. Dreusch A.B. Körner H. Zumft W.G. Canters G.W.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 279-291Google Scholar) predict that these glutamates are located either close to the periplasmic surface (Glu-122 and Glu-125) or in the middle of the membrane close to FeB (Glu-198 and Glu-267). The P. denitrificans NOR is, in addition to the physiological NO reduction, capable of reducing O2 to water (12Butland G. Spiro S. Watmough N.J. Richardson D.J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Fujiwara T. Fukumori Y. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1866-1871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Flock U. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The levels of O2 and NO reductase activity are closely correlated, implying that the same catalytic components are involved. To study the mechanism of proton transfer in NOR, we have previously used the reaction with O2 because the chemical reactivity of NO in aqueous solutions hampers direct pH measurements. We characterized the single-turnover reaction between fully reduced detergent-solubilized NOR and O2 using the flow-flash technique in combination with time-resolved optical spectroscopy (15Flock U. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our results showed that oxygen binds to heme b3 with a τ = 40 μs (at 1 mm O2), after which electron transfer from the low spin hemes b and c to the O2 bound at the binuclear site occurs with a τ = 25 ms (at pH 7.5). A slow additional phase of oxidation of hemes b and c with τ ∼ 1s presumably completes the reduction of O2 to H2O. The τ = 25-ms phase is coupled to proton uptake from the bulk solution, and the rate constant depends on pH in a way well described by a model in which the rate is limited by proton transfer from an internal protonatable group, in rapid equilibration with the bulk protons, into the active site with a kmax = 250 s–1. The internal group has a pKa of ∼6.6 and was suggested to be an amino acid located close to the active site (15Flock U. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Flock U. Reimann J. Ädelroth P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 188-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The τ = 25-ms reaction represents a specific step in the catalytic cycle that is limited by the rate of proton transfer. Consequently, mutations that change the properties of the proton uptake pathway are expected to influence this rate. Here, we have studied the reaction between fully reduced NOR and O2 in mutant forms of NOR where the glutamate at position 122 has been exchanged for either alanine, glutamine, or aspartate, with special emphasis on what the effects of the mutations are on the τ = 25-ms phase. Also, the effects of exchanging a nearby glutamate, Glu-125, with alanine or glutamine are examined. Our results provide strong experimental evidence that both glutamates are needed for efficient proton transfer in NOR and that Glu-122 is at the aperture of a non-electrogenic E-pathway 5This pathway should not be confused with the E-pathway hypothesis for fumarate reductase (17Lancaster C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 215-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).5This pathway should not be confused with the E-pathway hypothesis for fumarate reductase (17Lancaster C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 215-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). that serves to deliver protons from the periplasm to the buried active site in NOR. Growth of Bacteria and Purification of NOR–The NOR used in this study was from P. denitrificans, expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 using the expression system described in Ref. 12Butland G. Spiro S. Watmough N.J. Richardson D.J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar. Growth of bacteria, the preparation of cytoplasmic membranes, and the subsequent purification of NOR was as previously described (12Butland G. Spiro S. Watmough N.J. Richardson D.J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), but with the following modifications. After induction with 1-mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, batch cultures (800 ml of TB (terrific broth) (18Tartof K.D. Hobbs C.A. Bethesda Res. Lab. Focus. 1987; 9: 12Google Scholar) in a 2-liter un-baffled conical flask) were incubated at 30 °C for 5 h with shaking (180 rpm). The cultures were incubated for a further 5 h at 18 °C without agitation before being returned to 30 °C with shaking (180 rpm) for 8 more hours prior to harvesting the cells. After application of the sample to the Q-Sepharose HP column, it was washed with 300 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% β-dodecyl maltoside (DDM)) that contained 15% (v/v) Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 m NaCl, and 0.05% DDM). The column was then developed with a 750-ml gradient of 15–55% buffer B, and the eluent was collected in 5-ml fractions. These conditions yield enzyme that is sufficiently pure for spectroscopic experiments without the need for further purification on chelating Sepharose. After concentration and dialysis into 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05% DDM, pH 7.6, the protein was stored at –80 °C until it was needed. Spectroscopic Characterization of the Glu-122 Mutant Forms of NOR–Each preparation of the mutant forms of NOR was characterized by both UV-visible and CW-X band EPR spectroscopy. UV-visible spectra were recorded between 350 and 700 nm using an Hitachi U3100 spectrophotometer. The concentration of oxidized NorBC was calculated using the molar extinction coefficient (ϵ411 = 3.11 × 105 m–1 cm–1) (19Cheesman M.R. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3994-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). EPR spectra were recorded with a Bruker ESP 300 X-band spectrometer equipped with an ESR-900 liquid helium cryostat manufactured by Oxford Instruments. Bruker ESP software version 2.2 was used to manipulate the spectra. Sample Preparation for Flow-flash Studies–The NOR stock was diluted to 5–10 μm in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.05% DDM in a modified Thunberg cuvette, air was exchanged for nitrogen on a vacuum line, and the enzyme was reduced by adding 2 mm ascorbate and 0.2 μm N-methylphenazinium methosulfate. Sometimes, small amounts (10–80 μm) of sodium dithionite were also added to ensure complete reduction. Nitrogen was then exchanged for 100% CO, and CO recombination to the high spin heme was studied by flash photolysis on a setup described in Ref. 20Brändén M. Sigurdson H. Namslauer A. Gennis R.B. Ädelroth P. Brzezinski P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5013-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar. Before the flow-flash experiments, the CO concentration was lowered to avoid CO recombination interfering with O2 binding (see Ref. 15Flock U. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The appropriate CO concentration was judged by measuring the apparent CO recombination rate constant. Flow-flash Measurements–Experiments were performed as in Ref. 15Flock U. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P.

Briefly, fully reduced CO-bound NOR was mixed 1:5 with an oxygenated buffer in a modified stopped-flow apparatus (Applied Photophysics). After a 200-ms delay, a 10-ns laser flash (Nd-YAG laser; Quantel) was applied, dissociating CO and allowing O2 to bind and initiate the reaction. The time course of the reaction was studied from microseconds to seconds at different wavelengths in the Soret and visible regions. Typically, at each wavelength and time scale, several individual traces (2Watmough N.J. Butland G. Cheesman M.R. Moir J.W. Richardson D.J. Spiro S. Biochim. Biophys.

Each resulting trace was then reduced to ∼1000 points by averaging over a progressively increasing number of points. For the pH dependence measurements, the buffer concentration in the NOR solution before mixing was decreased to 10 mm (Hepes at pH 7.5). The oxygenated solution contained 50 mm KCl, 0.05% DDM, and 100 mm of either citrate, pH 5.0–6.0, Mes, pH 6.0–7.0, Hepes, pH 7.0–8.0, or Tris-HCl, pH 8.0–9.0, depending on the final pH required. Alternatively, Bis-Tris propane was used (pH 6.0–9.0). No significant differences between the traces obtained with different buffers at the same pH were observed (data not shown). Proton Uptake Measurements–Proton uptake from solution was measured essentially as in Ref. 15Flock U. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar. Briefly, the buffering capacity of the sample was lowered by passing it through a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm KCl, 0.05% DDM, 50 μm EDTA, pH ∼ 7.5. Phenol red at 40 μm was then added to the sample, which was reduced (with ascorbate/5-methylphenazinium methosulfate) and CO-equilibrated as above. In the flow-flash experiment, the O2-saturated solution contained 50 mm KCl, 0.05% DDM, 50 μm EDTA, and 40 μm phenol red at pH ∼ 7.5. Phenol red in its deprotonated form has a peak at 560 nm, but absorbance changes were monitored at 570 nm (see “Results”) to avoid interference from oxidation of the enzyme (see Ref. 15Flock U. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To correct for any residual contribution from oxidation of NOR at 570 nm, a trace collected in the presence of 20 mm Hepes buffer was subtracted from the trace in the absence of buffer. The buffering capacity of the solution (ΔA570/Δ[H+]), giving Δ[H+]/[reacting NOR] was measured as in Ref. 15Flock U. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar. Data Handling and Analysis–To extract the rate constants and amplitudes of the observed phases in the flow-flash reaction, the time-resolved changes in absorbance, measured at different wavelengths, were fitted either separately or globally to a model of consecutive irreversible reactions using the software package Pro-K (Applied Photophysics). The pH dependence of the τ ∼ 10-ms phase in E122D was fitted to a simple Henderson-Hasselbalch titration of one protonatable group using the equation kobs = kmax/(1 + 10pH-pKa). The data for WT were fitted the same way but with the addition of a slow background rate constant, k0, of 1–3 s–1. The Spectroscopic and Ligand Binding Properties of the NOR Glu-122 Variants–It has previously been shown from studies of E122A, E122Q, and E122D in whole cells and membranes of P. denitrificans that the Ala and Gln variants are essentially inactive but that the E122D variant retains close to WT activity (8Thorndycroft F.H. Butland G. Richardson D.J. Watmough N.J. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To establish the molecular basis for these observations, the spectroscopic and CO binding properties of the purified NOR variants were assessed. The UV-visible and EPR spectra of the oxidized Glu-122 mutants were essentially indistinguishable from WT recombinant enzyme (supplemental Fig. S1). The CW-X band EPR spectra recorded at 10 K (supplemental Fig. S1) showed that the preparations had the expected resonances of the low spin ferric c-type and b-type hemes in NOR (see Ref. 12Butland G. Spiro S. Watmough N.J. Richardson D.J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar for a description of the EPR features of recombinant WT NOR). The features arising from high spin ferric heme b3 (g = 6.0) and ferric FeB (g = 4.3) were relatively small, suggesting that the binuclear center (>95%) remains intact with heme b3 and FeB magnetically coupled and therefore EPR-silent. CO recombination to the reduced high spin heme b3 after flash photolysis of the CO-bound fully reduced NOR was also studied as a probe of the integrity of the catalytic site. In the WT recombinant NOR, at 1 mm CO, CO recombination is biphasic, with time constants of 5–10 and 50–100 μs and ∼50% contribution (time constants and relative amplitudes varying slightly between preparations) from each phase (15Flock U. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). No significant changes in CO recombination time constants or relative amplitudes were observed at 1 mm CO in any of the Glu-122 (Ala, Gln, or Asp) variants (data not shown). Further evidence for the integrity of the active site of NOR was forthcoming from monitoring oxygen binding in the flow-flash reaction between fully reduced NORs and O2. Previous work with WT recombinant NOR has established that O2 binds to heme b3 with τ = 40 μs (at 1 mm O2). Fig. 2 shows the comparison between wild type, E122A, E122Q, and E122D in the O2 binding phase, demonstrating that none of the mutant NORs show significant changes in binding rate constants or amplitudes. These results taken together with the CO rebinding, UV-visible, and EPR spectroscopy results indicate the integrity of the binuclear site in all mutants and that the decrease in turnover activity of the E122A and E122Q variants is not due to impaired ligand binding. Reduction of the b 2+3-O2 Species in the Glu-122 Variants of NOR–In the reaction between fully reduced wild type NOR and oxygen, the second major phase with a time constant of ∼25 ms (at pH 7.5) was assigned to the reduction of the b 2+3-O2 species by electron transfer from both the low spin hemes b and c to the catalytic site (15Flock U. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The comparison between WT and Glu-122 mutant forms of NOR for this phase is shown both at 430 nm (which reports O2 binding to and oxidation of the ferrous high spin heme b3) (see Fig. 2A) and 420 nm (which reports oxidation of both low spin hemes) (see Fig. 2B). These experiments clearly show that the τ = 25-ms phase is severely inhibited in the E122A and E122Q mutant forms. At 420 nm no oxidation is observed on this time scale, and at 430 nm there is only a small residual ms phase with <10% of the WT amplitude in E122A and E122Q; see below. In both the E122A and E122Q mutant NORs, clear oxidation occurs only on the really slow time scale (τ ∼ 3 s), showing that the 25-ms phase is either totally absent or severely delayed in these mutants. Before the τ ∼ 3-s phase, there are small absorbance changes occurring (Fig. 2B) that cannot be clearly assigned at present. Because only O2 binding and no oxidation has occurred in these mutants, a possible reaction is the equilibration at the active site between O2 and the photolysed CO. Another possibility is that the small residual τ = 25-ms phase seen at 430 nm corresponds to fractional oxidation of the binuclear site and that there is fractional re-equilibration of electrons in the mutant NORs on this slower time scale. In the E122D mutant NOR, however, oxidation is clearly seen at both 420 and 430 nm (Fig. 2, A and B) with a τ ∼ 10 ms 6For all time (and rate) constants reported, the variation between separate experiments were <20%. at pH 7.5 and an amplitude similar to WT. The τ ∼ 10-ms phase in the E122D mutant involves oxidation of both hemes b and c with amplitudes similar to the corresponding τ = 25-ms phase in WT, as studied also at 550 and 560 nm (data not shown). In WT NOR, there is a slower phase of heme oxidation with a τ = 1–2 s that is presumably due to the final step in the reaction between fully reduced NOR and O2, producing the fully oxidized NOR and H2O. In the E122D mutant NOR, this slow reaction occurs similarly to WT (see Fig. 2B). At some pH values in E122D, there is an additional phase with τ ≥ 0.1 s that we cannot assign at present but with an amplitude <5% of the total absorbance change. In the E122A and Gln mutant NORs, as the pH was lowered, the τ = 25-ms phase was still absent at 420 nm and no rate constants were fitted to the small residual phase at 430 nm (data not shown). The Electron Transfer and Coupled Proton Uptake to b 2+3-O2 in E122D NOR–The rate constant for the τ = 25-ms phase in WT NOR has a pH dependence (see Fig. 3) well fitted by a pKa = 6.6 (±0.06) and maximum rate constant at low pH of 250 (±10) s–1 (15Flock U. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the E122D mutant NOR, the pH dependence of the corresponding phase (τ ∼ 10 ms at pH 7.5) was significantly shifted compared with WT. Up to pH ∼ 8.5, no dependence on pH was observed, whereas at even higher pH the rate constant started to decrease in a way that could be fitted with a pKa = 9.1 (±0.2) and a maximum rate constant of ∼160 (±10) s–1 (see Fig. 3). It should be noted that the pKa obtained is very approximate because at higher pH (>9.5) the amplitude of the signal started to decrease, possibly as a result of degradation of the protein. Therefore, the pKa ∼ 9 should be considered a lower limit, because there is clearly no pH dependence up to pH 8.5. It is also possible that the decrease in amplitude of the τ ∼ 10-ms phase seen in E122D at very high pH is a “real” effect (due, for example, to the pKa of the intermediate forming at the binuclear site having a pKa in this region; see “Discussion”), and the reason we do not observe this amplitude decrease at higher pH in WT is that this phase has become so slow that it overlaps with the τ = 1-s phase. In WT NOR, ∼1H+/reacting NOR was taken up from solution concomitantly with the τ = 25-ms phase (see Fig. 4), as studied using the pH-sensitive dye phenol red at 570 nm (for a discussion on the number of protons taken up during oxidation and the number “preloaded” in the reduced NOR, see Re"

Mechanisms leading to these pathologies are currently under intensive investigation. The R116C and the R49C mutations in αA-crystallin cause hereditary cataracts (2Litt M. Kramer P. LaMorticella D.M.

Genet. 2003; 11: 784-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, in vivo models that recapitulate the heterozygosity of human patients have not yet been developed.The eye lens is an ideal model system to study small heat shock protein function because it is a simple cellular system with only two cell types, an anterior layer of cuboidal lens epithelial cells covering layers of uniquely elongated differentiated lens fiber cells. The development of the eye lens is a highly coordinated process involving intricate control of cell cycle regulation and differentiation (9Sue Menko A. Exp. Eye Res. 2002; 75: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10Griep A.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 17: 686-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). During differentiation, lens fiber cells express a high abundance of crystallins, cytoplasmic proteins that are divided into two major families in vertebrate lenses, α-crystallins and βγ-crystallins. Essential for lens transparency, α-crystallin is a large multimeric complex with an average aggregate molecular mass of ∼500 kDa and is obtained as a complex of αA-crystallin and αB-crystallin when isolated from lens fiber cells (11Bloemendal H. de Jong W.

Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1847-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). αA-crystallin constitutes nearly 20% of the soluble protein in newborn human lenses and acts as a molecular chaperone (13Horwitz J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Gene knock-out mice have provided significant knowledge about αA-crystallin functions and demonstrated that besides its role in refraction, it is an active polypeptide that has anti-apoptotic properties important for maintaining the survival of lens epithelial cells in vivo (15Andley U.P.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1073-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Among each of the autosomal dominant mutations that have been linked with hereditary cataracts, only the R49C mutation in αA-crystallin has been found to lie outside the conserved C-terminal α-crystallin domain common to all small heat shock proteins (3Mackay D.S. Andley U.P. Shiels A. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 11: 784-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This mutation was linked with hereditary cataract in a four-generation Caucasian family. The C to T transition in codon 49 of exon 1 in the gene encoding αA-crystallin results in the nonconservative substitution of arginine 49 to cysteine (R49C). No phenotypic and molecular characteristics of the cataract are available. The positive charge on arginine 49 in αA-crystallin has been highly conserved during evolution, and it is essential for the in vitro chaperone activity of αA-crystallin (18Biswas A. Miller A. Oya-Ito T. Santhoshkumar P. Bhat M. Nagaraj R.H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4569-4577Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19de Jong W.W. Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Transfection studies of the αA-R49C protein in lens epithelial cell cultures have shown a 15-fold increase in basal cell death suggesting a gain of function phenotype of the mutant protein (3Mackay D.S. Andley U.P. Shiels A. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 11: 784-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Staurosporine-induced levels of cell death increased 8-fold in the αA-R49C transfectants compared with wild type αA-crystallin. Although much can be learned from studying the mutant protein in vitro or in transgenic models, these studies have a number of limitations (3Mackay D.S. Andley U.P. Shiels A. Eur. J. Hum.

Because how mutations affect protein interactions at low concentrations may have little relevance to how they associate in vivo at higher concentrations in the lens, an optimal design of a model must investigate the effect of the mutation in vivo. Point mutation gene knock-in mice are a powerful tool for dissecting gene function. Point mutation gene knock-in mice are those animals that have a point mutation in an endogenous gene that does not ablate the gene but merely changes its function (24Skvorak K. Vissel B. Homanics G.E. Genesis. 2006; 44: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Gene knock-in mice have been used with great success to genetically dissect the role of specific genes; for example, the role played by specific lens connexin genes has been convincingly delineated with knock-in mice (25White T.W. Science. 2002; 295: 319-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 26Xia C.H. Liu H. Chang B. Cheng C. Cheung D. Wang M. Huang Q. Horwitz J. Gong X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 3004-3010Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and they have a number of advantages. First, it is possible to analyze the effect of the mutation in every cell. Second, it allows a comparison of the wild type with heterozygous and homozygous animals and to study gene dosing effects. Finally, if successful, generation of such a mouse model would represent the first knock-in mutation in vivo for small heat shock protein associated with inherited clinical pathology.In this study, we created the first gene knock-in mice to investigate the mechanism by which the R49C mutation in αA-crystallin produces cataract in vivo. We demonstrate that αA-R49C expression enhances protein insolubility and lens cell death in vivo leading to a small eye, small lens, and severe cataracts. Assessment of cell survival and signaling proteins suggests a link between in vivo cell death and dephosphorylation of the protein Bad, a central molecule involved in cell survival. Furthermore, the αA-R49C heterozygosity increased the interaction of key lens substrate proteins with the chaperone suggesting a higher level of unstable proteins in the mutant lenses. Together, these results extend our understanding of how αA-crystallin functions in vivo, and they support the idea that αA-crystallin is an active polypeptide critical to the development of a transparent lens phenotype.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Knock-in Mice—Knock-in mice were generated by removing the normal gene from one allele by homologous recombination in 129SvJ male embryonic stem (ES) 2The abbreviations used are:ESembryonic stemBrdUrd5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridineWTwild typeLCliquid chromatographynanoLC-FTMS/MSlinear quadrupole ion trap Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometerMS/MStandem mass spectrometryPBSphosphate-buffered salineTUNELterminal dUTP nick-end labelingCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidLTQlinear quadrupole ion trapMIPmajor intrinsic protein. cells (SCC-10) to modify the αA-crystallin (cryaa) gene such that exon 1 contained the R49C mutation, whereas the second copy of the gene was wild type. Mouse genomic DNA clone derived from a 129Sv strain containing αA-crystallin gene was generously provided by Dr. Eric Wawrousek. The 2.9-kb 5′ arm was cloned into a cloning plasmid with the neomycin cassette. Exon 1 of the cryaa gene at codon 49 was mutated from C to T by site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange kit, Stratagene). Next, the 4.8-kb 3′ arm of the cryaa gene was cloned into the plasmid (Fig. 1). The plasmid was electroporated into ES cells, and ES cell selection, colony picking, freezing, expansions, and cryo-preservation of homologous recombinant clones expressing the R49C mutant αA-crystallin gene were performed at the Washington University ES Cell Core facility. Clones positive for neomycin were selected with G418, and 150 ES cell colonies were screened for correct gene targeting by Southern blot analysis. Four clones were found to be correctly targeted. The results presented here are from clone 85, which was positive for the mutation. The C to T mutation was verified by sequencing genomic DNA of the positive ES clones (Fig. 1B). Correct insertion of the knock-in allele was tested by probing 5′ and 3′ ends of the cryaa gene in the plasmid construct and with primers outside the cryaa gene. The neomycin-positive ES clones were analyzed by Southern blotting. ES cells positive for the mutation were karyotyped to check for normal chromosomes, injected into C57BL6 blastocytes, and implanted into pseudo-pregnant ICR females (27Nagy A. Gocza E. Diaz E.M. Prideaux V.R. Ivanyi E. Markkula M. Rossant J. Development (Camb.). 1990; 110: 815-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chimeric founders were mated with wild type C57BL6 mice, and their progeny that genotyped positive for germ line transmission were bred. First generation offspring that inherited the targeted allele with neomycin were subsequently backcrossed into C57BL/6J. The knock-in mice with the neomycin cassette were identified by PCR-based genotyping described in Fig. 1A (PCR product of 224 bp with pcr3 and pcr4 primers). Next, the heterozygous knock-in mice were bred with Cre EIIa transgenic mice in C57BL/6J genetic background to specifically delete the neomycin cassette (28Lakso M. Pichel J.G. Gorman J.R. Sauer B. Okamoto Y. Lee E. Alt F.W. Westphal H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5860-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar, 29Tsien J.Z. Chen D.F. Gerber D. Tom C. Mercer E.H. Anderson D.J. Mayford M. Kandel E.R. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1996; 87: 1317-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). All mice were further genotyped by Southern blot analysis of XhoI-digested DNA and hybridization with a 5′ end probe. Heterozygous offspring within each mating scheme were subsequently bred to yield homozygous mice. PCR genotypes of heterozygous and homozygous knock-in mice after deletion of the neomycin cassette are shown in Fig. 1D. Two independent lines of mice, R49CKI3 and R49CKI4, expressing the mutation in cryaa were bred. Because we started with a 129Sv mouse clone, which is known to express a deletion mutation in CP49, a lens fiber cell-specific protein, we backcrossed our αA-R49C knock-in mice with C57BL6 mice. These mice were further genotyped to exclude the presence of a deletion mutation in the gene for lens phakinin (CP49), which is characteristic of the 129 strain from which ES cells were derived. This analysis was done to verify that the cataract was not the result of the absence of wild type CP49 (30Alizadeh A. Clark J.I. Seeberger T. Hess J. Blankenship T. Spicer A. FitzGerald P.G. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 3722-3727PubMed Google Scholar). Only those mice that were wild type for CP49 expression were analyzed. No mutant CP49 gene was detected in these mice (supplemental Fig. S1).Mice were maintained at Washington University by the Division of Comparative Medicine, by trained veterinary staff. All protocols and animal procedures were approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee.Genotyping—Genomic DNA was prepared from tail biopsy using the DNeasy spin column kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. Mice were genotyped by PCR amplification (50 μl) of tail DNA (1 μg). To identify the knock-in construct containing neomycin cassette, the following primers were used: pcr3 (Cryaa Genotype 30-mer forward primer), TCCTGTCTTCCACCATCAGCCCCTACTACC; pcr4 (Cryaa Genotype 30-mer reverse primer), ACATTTCCCCGAAAAGTGCCACCTAAGCTT. This primer set generates a 224-bp product spanning the 5′ end of exon 1 of cryaa into the neomycin cassette. To detect mice homozygous for the knock-in construct the primers were as follows: pcr1 (5′ forward primer) TGGACGTCACCATTCAGCATCCTTGGTT and pcr2 (3′ reverse primer) AAGCACGCTTGCCTTCGCCATGTAACTT. The expected size of the PCR product was 550 bp (no neomycin cassette) and 2.5 kb (with neomycin cassette). Primers for detecting Cre-recombinase were 5′ forward primer GCATTACCGGTCGATGCAACGAGTGATGAG and 3′ reverse primer GAGTGAACGAACCTGGTCGAAATCAGTGCG with an expected 408-bp PCR product. The lox P site was 34 bp long and two 8-bp multicloning sites were present on either side, giving a 50-bp longer PCR product for the knock-in mice than the wild type mice after breeding with Cre recombinase expressing transgenic mice. The wild type allele in heterozygous mice without the neomycin cassette was identified using genomic DNA and primer set pcr1 and pcr2 as a PCR product of 500 bp. DNA isolated from homozygous mice with the neomycin cassette deleted produced a 550-bp PCR product (Fig. 1D). Lack of the wild type cryaa allele in the homozygous mice was confirmed by absence of the 500-bp PCR product (Fig. 1D). PCR products (5 μl) were separated on 2% agarose gels (Bio-Rad) containing 0.05% ethidium bromide and visualized (302 nm) with a gel documentation system (AlphaImager 3400; Alpha Innotech).Preparation of Peptides from Wild Type and αA-R49C Mutant Lens Epithelial and Cortical Fractions for Mass Spectrometric Analysis—Lens epithelial and cortical fiber cells were freshly dissected from wild type and αA-R49C knock-in mutant lenses, and protein samples in 20 μl of lysis buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) were precipitated using the two-dimensional clean-up kit (GE Healthcare). The pellets were dissolved in 10 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 8 m urea. The proteins were reduced in 5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine by the addition of 2 μl of a 50 mm solution in water. After 30 min, iodoacetamide (1 μl) was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. After alkylation (30 min, in dark), the sample was digested with endoprotease LysC for 18 h at 37 °C. The sample was then diluted 8-fold, and digestion was continued with GluC (0.1 μg) overnight at 37 °C, followed by trypsin digestion for the same duration. The combined digest was diluted with an equal volume of water, and the peptides were extracted with a NuTip porous graphite carbon tip (Glygen part number NP2CAR.96). The tips were activated with 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid by drawing up 5 μl and expelling to waste five times. The tips were equilibrated with 0.1% formic acid by 10 sequential pipetting cycles (drawing and expelling) to waste. The digest was slowly drawn into the conditioned tip and expelled for 50 cycles. The tip was then placed into a microcentrifuge tube containing two times the digest volume and washed for four cycles. This step was repeated with another clean microcentrifuge tube of wash solution (0.1% formic acid). The peptides were then eluted with two sequential 10-μl aliquots of 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. The samples were evaporated to near dryness in a SpeedVac centrifuge. The samples were then transferred to low bind autosampler vials, and the tubes were rinsed with 10 μl of 1% formic acid, 1% acetonitrile for nanoLC-FTMS.NanoLC-FTMS Analysis—Mass spectrometry was performed using a linear quadrupole ion trap Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (LTQ-FTMS, Thermoelectron, San Jose, CA) as described previously (31King J.B. Gross J. Lovly C.M. Rohrs H. Piwnica-Worms H. Townsend R.R. Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 2171-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The nanoliquid chromatograph (Eksigent NanoLC, Eksigent, Livermore, CA) was interfaced to the LTQ-FTMS with a Pico-View nanocapillary source from New Objective (Woburn, MA). Sample injection was performed with an autosampler (Endurance, Spark, Plainsboro, NJ). The column was a C-18 PicoFrit (75 μm × 10 cm) (New Objective, Woburn, MA). The mobile phases were high pressure liquid chromatography grade water (Fisher) containing 1% formic acid (Sigma) (solvent A) and acetonitrile (Honeywell, Burdick & Jackson, Muskegon, MI) containing 1% formic acid (solvent B). The sample (5 μl) was loaded at 600 nl/min at 1% solvent B for 10 min. The flow was then decreased to 200 nl/min with isocratic elutions for 15 min that was followed by a linear increase in solvent B (0.3%/min) for 30 min. The LTQ FT (7 tesla) mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode. The survey scans (m/z = 350-2000) were acquired using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance with a resolution of ∼100,000 at m/z = 421.75 with a target value of ∼500,000. The 10 most intense ions from survey scans were isolated in the ion trap and analyzed after reaching a target value of ∼10,000. The MS/MS isolation width was 2.5 Da, and the normalized collision energy was 35%. Electrospray ionization was accomplished with a spray voltage of 2.2 kV without sheath gas. The ion transfer tube temperature was 200 °C.MS Data Analysis—The MS and MS/MS data from the nanoLC-FTMSMS were collected in the profile mode. The “raw” files were processed using MASCOT Distiller (Matrix Science, Oxford, UK) with the following settings. 1) For MS processing: 200 data points per Da; no aggregation method; maximum charge state =+8; minimum number of peaks = 1. 2) For MS/MS processing: 200 data points per Da; time domain aggregation method enabled; minimum number of peaks = 10; precursor charge and m/z, try to re-determine from the survey scan (tolerance = 2.5 Da); charge defaults =+2/+3; maximum charge state =+2. 3) For time domain parameters: minimum precursor mass = 700; maximum precursor mass = 16,000; precursor m/z tolerance for grouping = 0.1; maximum number of intermediate scans = 5; minimum number of scans in a group = 1. 4) For peak picking: maximum iterations = 500; correlation threshold = 0.90; minimum signal-to-noise = 3; minimum peak m/z = 50; maximum peak m/z = 100,000; minimum peak width = 0.001; maximum peak width = 2; and expected peak width = 0.01. The resulting Mascot generic files were exported to MASCOT, version 2.1.6. The tandem MS data were searched against the NCBI protein data base with the following constraints: MS tolerance = 10 ppm, MS/MS tolerance = 0.8 Da with fixed modifications of cysteine (carbamidomethylation) and methionine (oxidation) residues.Slit Lamp Examination and Recording—Slit lamp biomicroscopy was used on nonanesthetized mice in a masked fashion. Pupils were dilated with a mixture of 10% phenylephrine hydrochloride and 1% tropicamide (Alcon, Fort Worth, TX). After 3 min, the animal was placed directly facing the slit lamp by holding the mouse gently by the scruff of the neck. The left eye of the animals was examined. The knock-in mice were examined at postnatal ages between 3 weeks (eye opening) and 36 weeks. To confirm lens opacity in newborn mice, newborn mouse pups were sacrificed and examined by slit lamp biomicroscopy.Assessment of Lens Opacity—Cataract formation was scored by slit lamp biomicroscopy according to a modified LOCS III method. For stage 0, clear lens; for stage 1, loss of normal appearance of anterior and posterior lens and prominence of y-suture line. Changes appear by 3 weeks in heterozygous lenses. For stage 2, discrete posterior changes were accompanied by light nuclear opacity. Changes were evident at 4 months in heterozygous lenses. For stage 3, there was a nearly mature cataract, involving approximately three-fourths of the lens with vacuoles and opacity. Changes were evident by 8 months in heterozygous and 3 weeks in homozygous lenses. For stage 4, a completely mature cataract involving the cortex with vacuoles was evident in heterozygous lenses not before 1 year and in homozygous lenses at 2 months.Assessment of Proliferation—In vivo labeling with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was performed as described previously (17Xi J.H. Bai F. Andley U.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1073-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mice were injected with BrdUrd intraperitoneally (0.1 ml of a 10 mm solution of BrdUrd in sterile PBS) at 10 a.m. and were sacrificed 1 h later. Eyes were dissected and fixed, and mid-sagittal sections were labeled with a primary antibody to BrdUrd and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Labeled nuclei were detected with an Olympus microscope. The total number of nuclei were measured by hematoxylin staining of the sections. The labeling index was determined by the ratio of the BrdUrd-positive nuclei and the total number of nuclei per section. For each sample, three sections per lens were analyzed, and labeling index was determined for six lenses per genotype.Assessment of MIP (AQP0) Immunofluorescence—Lenses were embedded in paraffin, and 4-μm sections were stained with a polyclonal antibody to MIP (Alpha Diagnostics International), and an Alexa-568-conjugated secondary antibody, and visualized by confocal microscopy in a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope.Assessment of Lens Protein Expression—Whole lenses were homogenized in PBS containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g to separate soluble and insoluble fractions (20Andley U.P.

The protein concentration was measured by the Pierce BCA assay, and equal protein (15 μg) was loaded on the gel, unless otherwise noted.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1073-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (Alpha Diagnostics International). Densitometric analysis was performed with a Storm 860 system (GE Healthcare).Assessment of Disulfide Cross-linking—Whole lenses were homogenized in PBS without 10 mm dithiothreitol, and lens proteins were separated into soluble and insoluble fractions by centrifugation as described above. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with antibodies to αA-crystallin and γ-crystallin were performed.Assessment of αA-crystallin Interaction with Lens Proteins by Immunoprecipitation—A co-immunoprecipitation assay was used to investigate proteins interacting with αA-crystallin in wild type lenses and to investigate the effect of the αA-R49C mutation on the interaction of αA-crystallin with lens proteins. Lenses were homogenized in PME buffer (80 PIPES, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.8) and centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g. Supernatants were lysed for 30 min on ice with immune precipitation buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Supernatants were treated with a primary antibody to αA-crystallin and immunoprecipitate"
https://openalex.org/W2037427085,"Kynurenic acid is an endogenous neuroactive compound whose unbalancing is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of several neurological diseases. Kynurenic acid synthesis in the human brain is sustained by the catalytic activity of two kynurenine aminotransferases, hKAT I and hKAT II. A wealth of pharmacological data highlight hKAT II as a sensible target for the treatment of neuropathological conditions characterized by a kynurenic acid excess, such as schizophrenia and cognitive impairment. We have solved the structure of human KAT II by means of the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method at 2.3-A resolution. Although closely resembling the classical aminotransferase fold, the hKAT II architecture displays unique features. Structural comparison with a prototypical aspartate aminotransferase reveals a novel antiparallel strand-loop-strand motif that forms an unprecedented intersubunit beta-sheet in the functional hKAT II dimer. Moreover, the N-terminal regions of hKAT II and aspartate aminotransferase appear to have converged to highly similar although 2-fold symmetry-related conformations, which fulfill the same functional role. A detailed structural comparison of hKAT I and hKAT II reveals a larger and more aliphatic character to the active site of hKAT II due to the absence of the aromatic cage involved in ligand binding in hKAT I. The observed structural differences could be exploited for the rational design of highly selective hKAT II inhibitors."

Nitrite is reduced by deoxygenated ferrous hemes, such that heme deoxygenation increases the rate of NO generation. However, heme reactivity with nitrite, represented by its bimolecular rate constant, is greatest when the tetramer is in the R quaternary state. The mechanism underlying the higher reactivity of R-state hemes remains elusive. It can be due to the lower heme redox potential of R-state ferrous hemes or could reflect the high ligand affinity geometry of R-state tetramers that facilitates nitrite binding. We evaluated the nitrite reductase activity of unpolymerized sickle hemoglobin (HbS), whose oxygen affinity and cooperativity profile are equal to those of HbA, but whose heme iron has a lower redox potential. We now report that HbS exhibits allosteric nitrite reductase activity with competing proton and redox Bohr effects. In addition, we found that solution phase HbS reduces nitrite to NO significantly faster than HbA, supporting the thesis that heme electronics (i.e. redox potential) contributes to the high reactivity of R-state deoxy-hemes with nitrite. From a pathophysiological standpoint, under conditions where HbS polymers form, the rate of nitrite reduction is reduced compared with HbA and solution-phase HbS, indicating that HbS polymers reduce nitrite more slowly.

The various redox reactions catalyzed by ferrous hemes of the heme-globins (primarily hemoglobin and myoglobin) have interested scientists for over 150 years (1Gamgee A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.

In 1901, while studying the mechanism of meat curing, John Haldane described the ability of nitrite to oxidize hemoglobin (Hb) 5The abbreviations used are: HbhemoglobinMbmyoglobinmet-Hbmet-hemoglobinHbSsickle hemoglobin. to methemoglobin (met-Hb) and generate iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin (iron-nitrosyl-Hb) in sections of meat not exposed to air (2Haldane J.

The reaction of nitrite with deoxyhemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) was further characterized by Brooks in 1937 (3Brooks J. Proc. R. Soc.

An analogous reaction of nitrite with deoxymyoglobin (deoxy-Mb) has been associated with the regulation of cardiomyocyte respiration during physiological and pathological hypoxia (18Shiva S. Huang Z.

In an anaerobic environment nitrite is reduced to NO as deoxy-Hb is oxidized to met-Hb (Equation 1) (6Huang Z. Shiva S. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Patel R.P. Ringwood L.A. Irby C.E. Huang K.T. Ho C. Hogg N.

NO generated in this reaction can then be bound by other ferrous deoxy-hemes to form iron-nitrosyl-Hb (Equation 2) (21Kim-Shapiro D.B. Free Radic. Biol.

Nitrite(NO2-)+deoxy-Hb(Fe2+)+H+→NO+met-Hb(Fe3+)+OH-(Eq. 1) NO+deoxy-Hb(Fe2+)→iron-nitrosyl-Hb(Fe2+-NO)(Eq. 2) Importantly, this reaction is allosterically regulated, such that the maximal rate of nitrite reduction is observed at the midpoint of the reaction, rather than at the beginning when the concentration of deoxy-hemes is greatest (6Huang Z. Shiva S. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Patel R.P. Ringwood L.A. Irby C.E. Huang K.T. Ho C. Hogg N. Schechter A.N. Gladwin M.T. J. Clin.

Kraus D. Ho C. Gladwin M.T. Patel R.P. Blood. 2006; 107: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The two products of the deoxy-Hb-nitrite reaction, met-Hb and iron-nitrosyl-Hb, can both stabilize the Hb tetramer in the R- or high oxygen affinity conformation (6Huang Z. Shiva S. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Patel R.P. Ringwood L.A. Irby C.E. Huang K.T. Ho C. Hogg N. Schechter A.N. Gladwin M.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Notably, R-state hemes have been shown to have greater intrinsic nitrite reductase activity than T-state hemes, reflected by their higher bimolecular rate constants (8Huang K.T. Keszler A. Patel N. Patel R.P. Gladwin M.T. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31126-31131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 18Shiva S. Huang Z. Grubina R. Sun J.

Bonaventura C. Crumbliss A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39048-39054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, as the fraction of ferric and iron-nitrosylated hemes (and hence the degree of R-state stabilization) increases as the reaction progresses, the apparent bimolecular rate constant for nitrite reduction increases as well. This is because there are in fact two true bimolecular rate constants involved in this reaction: one characteristic of R-state hemes and one of T-state hemes. Whereas these true bimolecular rate constants remain unchanged, the apparent global bimolecular rate constant, determined by the ratio of T- and R-state hemes in the reaction, changes as the allosteric conformation of reactive hemes changes (Fig. 1). Throughout this article, all references to instantaneous bimolecular rate constants describe this apparent global rate constant of deoxy-hemes at a specific point along the T-to-R allosteric continuum. Reaction rate is a function of both reactant concentration (unliganded ferrous hemes) and the bimolecular rate constant (their intrinsic reactivity). It follows that this rate is low in the beginning of the reaction (greatest concentration of unliganded deoxy-hemes, but they are all in the T-state), peaks in the middle (a significant fraction of deoxy-hemes are still unliganded, yet are already stabilized in the R-state by the newly formed met-hemes and iron-nitrosyl-hemes), and ultimately slows down again (all unliganded deoxy-hemes have been consumed, even though all or most of Hb tetramers are now in the R-state conformation) (6Huang Z. Shiva S. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Patel R.P. Ringwood L.A. Irby C.E. Huang K.T. Ho C. Hogg N. Schechter A.N. Gladwin M.T. J. Clin.

Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12916-12927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there are two opposing effects of proton concentration on the reaction rate. According to the mechanism in Equation 1, the rate of nitrite reduction is proton dependent, as the formation of nitrous acid is rate-limiting. But deoxy-Hb also manifests pH-dependent redox cooperativity, known as the redox Bohr effect, whereby the formal heme redox potential changes as a function of pH (24Papa S. Guerrieri F. Izzo G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 25Blankman J.I. Shahzad N. Miller C.J. Guiles R.D.

Within the physiological pH range, a 1-unit decrease in pH corresponds to a 60-mV increase in the heme E½ (27Hoffman B.M. Bull C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 28Brunori M. Wyman J. Antonini E. Rossi-Fanelli A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1939; 131: 649-662Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), which lowers the bimolecular rate constant for its reaction with nitrite. Moreover, protons shift the oxygen dissociation curve to the right by stabilizing Hb in the T-state. This redox Bohr effect thus dampens allosteric autocatalysis by interfering with the T-to-R shift promoted by ferric and iron-nitrosylated hemes. Ultimately, even though the rate of nitrite reduction is greater at lower pH (due to the direct proton effect on nitrous acid formation), this increase is lower than predicted by the proton concentration effect alone (6Huang Z. Shiva S. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Patel R.P. Ringwood L.A. Irby C.E. Huang K.T. Ho C. Hogg N. Schechter A.N. Gladwin M.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Whereas the R-state of Hb and Mb clearly exhibit an increased bimolecular rate constant for nitrite reduction to NO compared with T-state Hb, (18Shiva S. Huang Z. Grubina R. Sun J. Ringwood L.A. MacArthur P.H. Xu X. Murphy E. Darley-Usmar V.M. Gladwin M.T. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 654-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) the relative contribution of heme redox potential (electron transfer propensity) versus high ligand affinity (heme pocket ligand-binding properties) to this increased reactivity is not certain. In both Hb and Mb these two properties are intrinsically coupled: as ligand affinity (P50) increases due to conversion to R-state, the heme redox potential (E½) decreases. Recently, the half-life of the reaction of nitrite with HbA and modified hemoglobins developed as potential blood substitutes was shown to decrease (so the reaction gets faster) as the redox potential increased (31Bonaventura C. Henkens R. Alayash A.I. Crumbliss A.L. IUBMB Life. 2007; 59: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Based on these data the authors concluded that ligand affinity, rather than redox potential, is the major determinant of the nitrite/Hb rate in these samples. Sickle hemoglobin (HbS) contains a mutant form of the β-globin chain with a single amino acid substitution at the 6 position, where the hydrophilic glutamate is replaced by the hydrophobic valine (32Pauling L. Itano H.A. Singer S.J. Wells I.C. Science. 1949; 110: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar, 33Ingram V.M. Nature. 1956; 178: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). When HbS concentration exceeds its solubility threshold deoxygenation induces polymerization of HbS tetramers, rigidifying and ultimately deforming red blood cells (34Noguchi C.T. Schechter A.N. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1985; 14: 239-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Polymerization of HbS is affected primarily by Hb concentration and composition (relative amounts of HbS, HbF, and HbA forms), but is also modulated by pH, temperature, phosphate concentration, and ligand pressure (35Noguchi C.T. Biophys. J. 1984; 45: 1153-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 36Noguchi C.T. Torchia D.A. Schechter A.N. J. Clin.

Interestingly, non-polymerized solution-phase HbS follows the same equilibrium ligand-binding curve as HbA (38Allen D.W. Wyman J. Rev. Hematol. 1954; 9: 155-157PubMed Google Scholar) and demonstrates similar ligand-binding kinetics (39Penneley R.R. Noble R.W. Caughey W.S. Biochemical and Chemical Aspects of Hemoglobin Abnormalities.

Che D. Goldbeck R.A. Hirsch R.E. Mohandas N. Kliger D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is no apparent difference in kinetic cooperativity between HbS and HbA, such that these species similarly transition from T- to R-state (41Shapiro D.B. Paquette S.J. Esquerra R.M. Che D. Goldbeck R.A. Hirsch R.E. Mohandas N. Kliger D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the HbS β6Glu → Val mutation does not alter the ligand-binding geometric properties of the heme pocket. However, HbS deviates significantly from HbA in the electronics of its heme pocket. Unpolymerized stripped HbS has a considerably lower redox potential than HbAo, with E½ = 70 mV for HbS compared with E½ = 85 mV for HbAo (42Bonaventura C. Taboy C.H. Low P.S. Stevens R.D. Lafon C. Crumbliss A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14557-14563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In an aerobic environment unpolymerized HbS also oxidizes more easily than HbA (43Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Blood. 1987; 70: 1245-1266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 45Harrington J.P. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 119: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with reported rates of autoxidation nearing 0.05 h-1 for oxy-HbS versus 0.029 h-1 for oxy-HbA at 37 °C (1.7-fold faster) (46Hebbel R.P. Morgan W.T. Eaton J.W. Hedlund B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). By uncoupling redox potential from ligand affinity, HbS presents a unique opportunity to study the contribution of heme electronics versus heme pocket geometry to the mechanism of nitrite reduction. We therefore characterized the kinetics of nitrite reduction by deoxy-HbS and compared it to the analogous reaction catalyzed by deoxy-HbA. We also examined the effects of polymerization on nitrite reduction kinetics. ReagentsAll chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless specified otherwise. Preparation of Hb ReagentsAll reagents were prepared at 25 °C in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, unless indicated otherwise. Purified human HbS was purchased from Sigma and reduced by incubation of an anaerobic HbS stock solution with 500 mm sodium hydrosulfite. Excess sodium hydrosulfite was removed by passage through two sequential Sephadex G-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Human normal adult hemoglobin (HbA) was prepared by hypotonically lysing erythrocytes, discarding membrane fractions after centrifugation, and dialyzing against 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with storage of the hemolysate at -80 °C (6Huang Z. Shiva S. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Patel R.P. Ringwood L.A. Irby C.E. Huang K.T. Ho C. Hogg N. Schechter A.N. Gladwin M.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated HbS was similarly prepared from a volunteer with high fractional HbS content (91.2% HbS, 4.2% HbF, 4.1% HbA2) or similar Hb distributions. Hb standard species for spectral deconvolution were prepared as previously described (23Grubina R. Huang Z. Shiva S. Joshi M.S. Azarov I. Basu S. Ringwood L.A. Jiang A. Hogg N. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Gladwin M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12916-12927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Oxygen saturation and concentration of HbA and HbS heme species were measured by visible absorption spectroscopy (HP8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer; Hewlett-Packard or a Cary 50 spectrophotometer) followed by deconvolution of the spectrum into components from standard spectra of HbA using least-squares analysis (6Huang Z. Shiva S. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Patel R.P. Ringwood L.A. Irby C.E. Huang K.T. Ho C. Hogg N. Schechter A.N. Gladwin M.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Standard reference spectra included deoxy-HbA, iron-nitrosyl-HbA, met-HbA, and nitrite-methemoglobin (nitrite-HbA). Oxyhemoglobin (oxy-HbA) was included only to confirm successful deoxygenation of the reaction. In some cases, Hb was concentrated using Centricon concentrating filters. All concentrations reflect heme, rather than tetrameric Hb, species. Anaerobic Reactions of Nitrite with HbAAll reactions were run anaerobically at 37 °C in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. HbA stock solution was deoxygenated by purging the head-space with helium gas with a channel for gas escape. 5 mm Sodium nitrite was reacted with 22, 47, 90, or 250 μm deoxy-HbA; oxygen leak into the system was prevented by application of positive helium pressure without a channel for gas escape. Reaction kinetics were monitored by absorption spectroscopy in a glass cuvette with a path length of 1 cm (for reactions with 22, 47, and 90 μm heme) or 0.2 cm (for reactions with 250 μm heme). Experiments with greater than 0.1% met-HbA or oxy-HbA prior to the addition of nitrite were discarded. The concentrations of heme species at each time point were determined by least squares spectral deconvolution using standard reference spectra as described above. The instantaneous reaction rates were measured as the instantaneous rate of deoxy-HbA consumption (negative change of deoxy-HbA concentration with respect to the time interval). The instantaneous bimolecular rate constants were calculated by dividing the instantaneous reaction rate at each time point by the remaining deoxy-heme and nitrite concentrations. Anaerobic Reactions of Nitrite with HbSAll reactions were run anaerobically at 37 °C in 0.1 m phosphate buffer and monitored by absorption spectroscopy in a 1-cm path length glass cuvette, except for reactions with 250 μm HbS that were carried out in a 0.2-cm path length cuvette. Additional modifications are described below for experiments performed in the presence of sodium dithionite. All experiments were conducted using HbS purchased from Sigma, except for studies comparing nitrite reductase activities of HbS and HbA and those conducted in the presence of dithionite, in which both Sigma HbS and freshly isolated HbS were used. Oxygenated HbS was added to an anaerobic reaction solution containing 0.1 m phosphate buffer, 10 mm 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and 5 units of 2 ml of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas species (PCDA); HbS was then rapidly deoxygenated by application of positive helium pressure with a channel for gas escape. Sodium nitrite was added to initiate the reaction upon confirmation of HbS deoxygenation by spectral analysis and deconvolution, and the channel for gas escape was removed to preclude oxygen leak. Experiments with greater than 7% met-HbS or 0.3% oxy-HbS prior to the addition of nitrite were discarded. Effect of heme concentration was studied by reacting a range of HbS concentrations (25, 50, 100, or 250 μm heme) with 5 mm sodium nitrite at 37 °C and pH 7.4. Effect of nitrite concentration was studied by reacting 50 μm HbS with a range of sodium nitrite concentrations (0, 0.25, 1, 5, 10, or 20 mm nitrite) at 37 °C and pH 7.4. The effect of pH was studied by reacting 50 μm HbS with 5 mm sodium nitrite at 37 °C and a range of solution pH (pH of phosphate buffer and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid adjusted to pH 6.73, 7.04, 7.3, 7.67, or 7.82). Instantaneous reaction rates and bimolecular rate constants were calculated as described above. Normalization of instantaneous bimolecular rate constants was done by multiplying the bimolecular rate constant at each time point by a correction factor of inverse log of -ΔpH (where ΔpH was the pH of the reaction -6.73) (6Huang Z. Shiva S. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Patel R.P. Ringwood L.A. Irby C.E. Huang K.T. Ho C. Hogg N. Schechter A.N. Gladwin M.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). These factors were calculated to be 2.04 (pH 7.04), 3.72 (pH 7.3), 8.71 (pH 7.67), and 12.3 (pH 7.82). Reactions of Nitrite with HbA and HbS in the Presence of DithioniteAll reactions were conducted with excess sodium dithionite in 0.1 m phosphate buffer at pH 7 at room temperature and analyzed by global analysis using Specfit (Spectrum Software Associates). One may think that sodium dithionite would reduce nitrite to NO itself but it does not or does so very slowly as shown in Fig. 2. As long as the concentration of sodium dithionite is kept below 10 mm, dithionite does not effectively reduce nitrite. Higher concentrations of dithionite were found to affect nitrite (such as 50 mm dithionite, data not shown). The data were analyzed using singular value decomposition followed by fitting of the reduced data matrix to a zero-order kinetic model at all collected wavelengths and time points. Specfit was also used to obtain bimolecular rate constants when excess Hb was reacted with nitrite, fitting to a pseudo-first order process. Studies of Polymerized HbSHbS samples were concentrated to greater than 15 mm and then put under positive argon pressure overnight for deoxygenation. The samples were kept on ice to prevent polymerization during this process. The degree of deoxygenation was monitored by near infrared absorption spectroscopy examining the peak of deoxy-Hb at 760 nm in a 0.1-cm path length cell. Once the sample was at least 90% deoxygenated, sodium dithionite was added and the sample was temperature jumped to 37 °C to induce polymerization. Nitrite was then added to the sample and the kinetics of the nitrite/Hb reaction was monitored using near infrared absorption spectroscopy at room temperature. Statistical AnalysisData were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) and are reported as mean ± S.E. Unpaired t test was used to compare maximal rates of nitrite reduction by deoxy-HbS and deoxy-HbA. Linear regression analysis of the rates of nitrite reduction (shown in Figs. 4 and 5) is reported as mean ± 95% CI. For Figs. 7 and 8, standard deviations were calculated and Student's t test was used to calculate a p value. Results were considered statistically significant with p < 0.05.FIGURE 5Dual modulation of nitrite reduction by reaction pH.

https://openalex.org/W2029897206,"Human kynurenine aminotransferase II (hKAT-II) efficiently catalyzes the transamination of knunrenine to kynurenic acid (KYNA). KYNA is the only known endogenous antagonist of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and is also an antagonist of 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Abnormal concentrations of brain KYNA have been implicated in the pathogenesis and development of several neurological and psychiatric diseases in humans. Consequently, enzymes involved in the production of brain KYNA have been considered potential regulatory targets. In this article, we report a 2.16Å crystal structure of hKAT-II and a 1.95Å structure of its complex with kynurenine. The protein architecture of hKAT-II reveals that it belongs to the fold-type I pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes. In comparison with all subclasses of fold-type I-PLP-dependent enzymes, we propose that hKAT-II represents a novel subclass in the fold-type I enzymes because of the unique folding of its first 65 N-terminal residues. This study provides a molecular basis for future effort in maintaining physiological concentrations of KYNA through molecular and biochemical regulation of hKAT-II.

In mammalian brain, glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter and acts through both ligand-gated ion channels and G-protein-coupled receptors, which are collectively called glutamate receptors (9Palmada M. Centelles J.J. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: d701-d718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of these receptors is responsible for basal excitatory synaptic transmission and many forms of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation and long-term depression, which are thought to underlie learning and memory (9Palmada M. Centelles J.J. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: d701-d718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Martin S.J. Grimwood P.D. Morris R.G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 649-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). However, any event or process leading to a sudden or chronic increase in the activity of glutamate receptors often induces the death of neurons (11Ogura A. Miyamoto M. Kudo Y. Exp. Brain Res. 1988; 73: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Consequently, a mechanism capable of preventing glutamate receptors from being overly stimulated seems essential for maintaining the normal physiological condition of the brain (12Stone T.W.

Recently, KYNA has been identified as an endogenous ligand for an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, GPR35, which is predominantly expressed in immune cells (20Wang J. Simonavicius N. Wu X. Swaminath G. Reagan J. Tian H. Ling L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22021-22028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The tryptophan metabolic pathway is activated under inflammatory conditions, such as viral invasion, presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharides or interferon stimulation (21Mellor A.L. Munn D.H. Nat.

The activation of tryptophan metabolism causes a reduced plasma tryptophan level and an elevation in KYNA concentration (13Stone T.W. Darlington L.G. Nat. Rev. Drug.

KYNA is produced enzymatically by irreversible transamination of kynurenine, the primary catabolic product of tryptophan, and the newly formed KYNA is secreted into the extracellular milieu (23Speciale C.

In mammals, four proteins arbitrarily named as kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) I, II, III, and IV, have been considered to be involved in KYNA synthesis in the CNS (26Guidetti P. Okuno E.

Neurochem. 2007; 102: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These proteins are all pyridoxal 5-phosphate-(PLP)-dependent enzymes. KAT-II is considered the principal enzyme responsible for the synthesis of KYNA in the rat brain (26Guidetti P. Okuno E. Schwarcz R. J. Neurosci.

Mice in which KAT II was removed by genomic manipulation showed a substantial decrease in brain KYNA levels and presented with phenotypic changes that were in line with this chemical deficit (7Alkondon M.

But, it seems difficult to build a three-dimensional model for hKAT-II based on the KAT-I structures because of poor amino acid sequence identities between KAT-I and KAT-II (11% for human enzymes). The crystal structure of an hKAT-II homologue from Pyrococcus horikoshii has also been determined (39Chon H. Matsumura H. Koga Y. Takano K. Kanaya S. Proteins. 2005; 61: 685-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); however, it is still hard to do structure/ligand-based drug design based upon this structure because it only shares a 28% percent amino acid sequence identity with hKAT-II. Based on our research, we can report the crystal structure of hKAT-II at a resolution of 2.16 Å in its PLP form as well as the structure in complex with its substrate kynurenine at a resolution of 1.95 Å. Determination of the three-dimensional structure of hKAT-II may contribute to the rational design of selective inhibitors that are of intense medical interest with respect to a number of pathological conditions in humans. Expression and Purification and Activity Assay of Recombinant hKAT-IIhKAT-II coding sequence was amplified from a human liver cDNA pool using a forward primer (5′-AAAACATATGAATTACGCACGGTTCAT-3′) and a reverse primer (AAAACTCGAGTCATAAAGATTCTTTTATAAGTTG-3′) containing the gene-specific sequence (hKAT II, NP_057312) and NdeI and Xho restriction sites, respectively. The amplified sequence was cloned into an Impact™-CN plasmid (New England Biolabs) for expression of a fusion protein containing a chitin-binding domain. Transformed Escherichia coli cells were cultured at 37 °C. After induction with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the cells were cultured at 15 °C for 24 h. Six liters of cells were harvested as the start materials for affinity purification. The soluble fusion proteins were applied to a column packed with chitin beads and subsequently hydrolyzed under reducing conditions. The affinity purification resulted in the isolation of hKAT II at around 80% purity. Further purification of the recombinant hKAT-II was achieved by DEAE-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, and gel-filtration chromatography. The purified recombinant hKAT-II was concentrated to 10 mg ml-1 protein in 5 mm phosphate buffer (pH7.5) using a Centricon YM-30 concentrator (Millipore). The KAT activity assay was based upon previously described methods (40Han Q. Fang J. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15781-15787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, a reaction mixture of 50 ml, containing 10 mml-kynurenine, 5 mm ketoglutarate, 40 mm PLP, and 2 μg of protein sample, was prepared using 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 45 °C, and the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 0.8 m formic acid. Supernatant of the reaction mixture, obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, was analyzed by HPLC with UV detection at 330 nm for both kynurenine and KYNA. hKAT-II CrystallizationThe crystals were grown by hanging-drop vapor diffusion methods with the volume of reservoir solution at 500 μl and the drop volume at 2 μl, containing 1 μl of protein sample and 1 μl of reservoir solution. The optimized crystallization buffer consisted of 15% PEG 10,000 and 0.1 m Hepes at pH 7.5. The crystals of the enzyme-substrate complexes were obtained by soaking the crystals in 2.5 mm of kynurenine in the above crystallization buffer for 3 days. Data Collection and ProcessingIndividual hKAT-II crystals were cryogenized using 25% glycerol in the crystallization buffer as a cryo-protectant solution. Diffraction data of hKAT-II crystals were collected at the Brookhaven National Synchrotron Light Source beam line X29A (λ = 1.0908 Å). Data were collected using an ADSC Q315 CCD detector. All data were indexed and integrated using HKL-2000 software; scaling and merging of diffraction data were performed using the program SCALEPACK (41Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The cofactor and substrate molecules were modeled when the R factor dropped to a value of around 0.25 at full resolution for all hKAT-II structures, based upon both the 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc electron density maps. Solvent molecules were automatically added and refined with ARP/wARP (48Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. 1997; D53: 448-455Google Scholar) together with Refmac 5.2.

Recombinant mouse KAT-II is active to both aminoadipate and kynurenine and prefers ketoglutarate as an amino group receptor (52Buchli R. Alberati-Giani D. Malherbe P. Kohler C. Broger C. Cesura A.M.

Metab. 2002; 76: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and together with our results, we can conclude that hKAT-II is also active to both kynurenine and aminoadipate. Overall StructureThe structures of hKAT-II were determined by molecular replacement and refined to 1.95-Å resolution for the hKAT-II:kynurenine complex and 2.30-Å resolution for the hKAT-II PLP form. Final models contain 4 × 425 amino acid residues each and yield a crystallographic R value of 19.4% and an Rfree value of 22.2% for the hKAT-II:kynurenine complex, and 24.2 and 25.6% for its PLP form with ideal geometry (Table 1). There are four protein molecules in an asymmetric unit, which form two biological homodimers. The residues of the four subunits in hKAT-II structures are numbered 1 (A) to 425 (A) for chain A, 1 (B) to 425 (B) for chain B, 1 (C) to 425 (C) for chain C, and 1 (D) to 425 (D) for chain D. To distinguish residues from the two subunits of a biological dimer, we labeled residues from opposite subunit with a star (*), such as Tyr-74*. The results of the refinement are summarized in Table 1. All residues in all four chains except for Leu-293 are in favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot as defined with PROCHECK (54Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Although Leu-293 (A), (B), (C), and (D) in all structures falls within a disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot of the solved structures, the excellent electron density allowed us to unambiguously assign the observed conformations. An overview of the dimeric structure model is shown in Fig. 2a. The structure has an aspartate aminotransferase large and small domain (Fig. 3). The large domain (residues 76-323) contains a seven-stranded β-sheet (b3-b9), and the small domain comprises the C-terminal part of the chain (residues 324-428), which folds into a 2-stranded β-sheet (b10, b11) covered with helices on one side. The residue Asp-230 interacts with the pyridine nitrogen of the cofactor (Figs. 4 and 5), which is structurally and functionally conserved within fold-type I of the PLP-dependent enzyme family, and indicates its importance for catalysis. Based upon the above features of the structure, hKAT-II is a fold-type I PLP-dependent enzyme (55Jansonius J.N. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Matsumura H. Koga Y. Takano K. Kanaya S. Proteins. 2005; 61: 685-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 60Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Upon superposing the native hKAT-II structure onto the pKAT-II structure (Fig. 2c), we identified the major difference in protein folding to be at their N-terminal residues. In the hKAT-II structure, there are two β-strands (b1 and b2) formed between Lys-49 and Glu-65 with a turn in residues 55 to 59. The region shows very good electron density (Fig. 2b), which allowed us to unambiguously assign the observed conformations. The two-stranded β-sheet structure is critical in forming a different conformation for hKAT-II (Fig. 2), because pKAT-II forms an α-helix (a2) in this region (Fig. 2c). In addition, the residues 1-49 of hKAT-II reside in the position that is occupied by the N-terminal residues from the other subunit of the biological dimer in other fold-type I aminotransferases. Here, the two-stranded β-sheet structure in hKAT-II is unique with respect to the other type I aminotransferases. Because no similar conformation has been found in all subclasses of the fold-type I PLP-dependent enzymes, we propose that hKAT-II represents a novel subclass in this group based upon its unique fold of the first 64 N-terminal residues. In the crystal, a homodimer of hKAT-II is found with the subunits related by a 2-fold non-crystallographic axis. Both subunits are involved in building up the two identical active sites of the hKAT-II dimer, which are positioned ∼20-Å apart (the distance between two cofactors). The pattern of subunit-subunit interactions is extensive, and residues from the N-terminal part (residues 9-49) from one subunit and a small and large domain from another subunit. The two strands from both subunits (β-strand 1, b1 in Fig. 2) form an inter-subunit β-sheet. This two-strand interaction is unique in hKAT-II structure. Active Site of hKAT-IIResidual electron density clearly revealed the presence of covalently bound PLP in the cleft situated at the interface of the subunits in the biological dimer (Fig. 4). The C4A atom of PLP is covalently attached to the NZ atom of Lys-263 through the formation of an internal Schiff base, and the internal aldimine gives rise to residue LLP263, represented as sticks in Fig. 4. The PLP pyridoxal ring is stacked between residues Tyr-142 and Pro-232 by hydrophobic interactions, and the C2A atom of PLP exhibits a hydrophobic interaction with the Val-197 side chain. The side chains of Tyr-233 and Asp-230 are hydrogen-bonded to O3 and N1 of the pyridoxal, respectively. The phosphate moiety of PLP is anchored by polar interactions with the peptide amide groups of residues Gly-116 and Ser-117 as well as by the side chains of Ser-117, Gln-118, Ser-262, Arg-270, and another subunit residue Tyr-74*. All residues involved in PLP binding in hKAT-II are identical to those involved in the PLP binding sites in pKAT-II. However, it is worthwhile to mention that the stacking interactions of Pro-232 with the re face of the pyridine ring of PLP in KAT-II enzymes has not been observed in other available aminotransferase structures. Substrate Recognition and CatalysisInspection of the crystal structure of the hKAT-II:kynurenine complex revealed that the substrate lies near the N1 atom of PMP, but kynurenine and the cofactor do not form an external aldimine. Several residues, including Arg-399, Tyr-142, Ser-143, and Asn-202 from one subunit, and Gly-39*, Leu-40*, Ile-19*, Arg-20*, and Tyr-74* from opposite subunit, define the substrate-binding site and contact the kynurenine molecule. The carboxylic group of the kynurenine substrate forms a salt bridge with the guanidinium group of Arg-399. The salt bridge is fixed by hydrogen-bonding interactions with the NH of Asn-202 from one subunit and the side chain of Gly-38* from another subunit at both sides of the salt bridge. The ring of Tyr-74* has a weak hydrophobic interaction with the phenyl ring of kynurenine, and its hydroxy group forms a weak hydrogen bond with the O2 atom of kynurenine. Gln-38* and Gly-39* are located at the turning point of the loop that dives into and partially plugs the enzyme active site, thus shielding the substrate-binding pocket from bulk solvents (Fig. 5). Upon superposing the native hKAT-II structure onto the hKAT-II:kynurenine complex structure (Fig. 6), we identified a major chain conformational change involving residues 16 to 31. By binding the substrate kynurenine, this N-terminal part moves from one side of the active center to the other, leaves space for the substrate aminophenyl side to bind (Fig. 6). It also encapsulates the carboxylic side of the substrate within the center; thereby, the movement of residues 16-31 is not only for substrate binding but also for shielding the substrate-binding pocket from bulk solvents. This conformational change also involves some side-chain movement, including Tyr-74*, Tyr-142, and Ser-143, which shift toward the substrate (Fig. 6). At the same time, the pyridine ring of PMP also tilts toward the substrate and leaves the C4 atom vulnerable for substrate attack. It is well known that by binding substrates, aspartate aminotransferase changes its conformation from an open to a closed form (61Rhee S. Silva M.M. Hyde C.C. Rogers P.H. Metzler C.M. Metzler D.E.

In hKAT-II, however, there is no large scale conformational change upon binding of the substrate. In summary, KAT-II is a principal aminotransferase involved in KYNA production in mammalian and human brains; therefore, it is apparently a potential regulatory target for maintaining physiological concentrations of brain KYNA. We report herein the crystal structures of hKAT-II and its complex with kynurenine. The presence of two-stranded β-sheet structures formed from N-terminal residues in the hKAT-II crystal structures separates it from other type I fold PLP-dependent enzymes. In addition, two-stranded β-sheet interaction of two subunits partially contributes to the formation of a homodimer. Moreover, the major main chain shift of residues 16-31 is essential for substrate binding and catalysis, which distinguishes it from most other typical type I fold aminotransferases whose substrate binding and catalysis largely depend upon domain-domain rotation. The structures of native hKAT-II and its complex with kynurenine provide an important molecular basis toward a comprehensive understanding of the substrate binding and catalysis in hKAT II, thus making it possible to work with structure ligand-based drug design targeting of this important enzyme in humans."

We report here that neudesin is an extracellular heme-binding protein and that its neurotrophic activity is dependent on the binding of heme to its cytochrome b5-like heme/steroid-binding domain. At first, we found that at least a portion of the purified recombinant neudesin appeared to bind hemin because the purified neudesin solution was tinged with green and had a sharp absorbance peak at 402 nm. The addition of exogenous hemin extensively increased the amount of hemin-bound neudesin. In contrast, neudesinΔHBD, a mutant lacking the heme-binding domain, could not bind hemin. The neurotrophic activity of the recombinant neudesin that bound exogenous hemin (neudesin-hemin) was significantly greater than that of the recombinant neudesin in either primary cultured neurons or Neuro2a cells, suggesting that the activity of neudesin depends on hemin. The neurotrophic activity of neudesin was enhanced by the binding of Fe(III)-protoporphyrin IX, but neither Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX nor protoporphyrin IX alone. The inhibition of endogenous neudesin by RNA interference significantly decreased cell survival in Neuro2a cells. This indicates that endogenous neudesin possibly contains hemin. The experiment with anti-neudesin antibody suggested that the endogenous neudesin detected in the culture medium of Neuro2a cells was associated with hemin because it was not retained on a heme-affinity column at all.

The present findings may shed new light on the function of extracellular heme-binding proteins. Heme is a key component of many biochemical reactions. Heme serves as a prosthetic group of heme-binding proteins such as hemoglobins, cytochromes, and guanylate cyclases. It is involved in important transportation, catalytic, electron transfer, and signaling activities. On the other hand, as heme is able to intercalate into lipid membranes and participate in the Feton reaction in the production of hydroxyl radicals, it is a potent catalyst for injury due to hydrogen peroxide, oxidized low-density lipoprotein, and activated neutrophils (1Balla G.

Heme-mediated oxidative stress is suggested to contribute to various pathologic inflammatory conditions including neuro-degenerative disorders (3Smith M.A. Hirai K. Hsiao K. Pappolla M.A. Harris P.L. Siedlak S.L. Tabaton M. Perry G. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2212-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). However, heme is almost always trapped by proteins in living cells to avert its toxicity (4Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Andrews N.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, free heme in plasma binds to the sole extracellular heme-binding protein hemopexin. The binding of extracellular heme to hemopexin prevents strong oxidative features and proinflammatory effects of free heme (5Hrkal Z. Vodrazka Z. Kalousek I. Eur. J.

For example, hemoglobin and myoglobin are among the most abundant heme-binding proteins, associated with oxygen carriers (8Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Cytochromes are involved in electron transport and steroidogenesis (9Black S.M. Harikrishna J.A. Szklarz G.D. Miller W.L. Proc.

Acta. 1999; 1411: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that the binding of heme to DGCR8, another heme-binding protein, is involved in microRNA processing (11Faller M. Matsunaga M. Yin S. Loo J.A. Guo F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Thus, heme-binding proteins may have unknown roles in biological functions. Neudesin is the novel secreted protein that we previously identified as a neurotrophic factor (12Kimura I. Yoshioka M. Konishi M. Miyake A. Itoh N. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Kimura I. Konishi M. Miyake A. Fujimoto M. Itoh N. J. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 83: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Mouse neudesin exhibited high similarity (∼90% identity) to human and rat neudesins. Neudesin was expressed in heart, kidney, brain, and lung, but not in liver, in adult mice. Neudesin exhibited significant neurotrophic activity in primary cultured cortical neurons and neural precursor cells. The neurotrophic activity was mediated through the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) pathways. However, the molecular property of neudesin still remained to be elucidated. Neudesin possesses a predicted cytochrome b5-like heme/steroid-binding domain in its primary structure. Therefore, we examined whether neudesin binds hemin and, if so, whether the binding exerts a significant effect on the activity of neudesin in neuronal cells. We found that hemin bound to the cytochrome b5-like heme/steroid-binding domain of the neudesin molecule, and that Fe(III)- protoporphyrin IX is essential for the neurotrophic activity of neudesin but not Fe(II)- protoporphyrin IX or protoporphyrin IX. The present results suggested that neudesin is the first extracellular heme-binding protein found to be involved in intercellular signal transduction. These findings have revealed a new potential role of extracellular heme-binding proteins. Production of Recombinant Mouse Neudesin Protein–Recombinant baculoviruses containing mouse neudesin cDNA or neudesinΔHBD cDNA with an identical tag sequence were obtained by cotransfection of Sf9 cells with a recombinant pBacPAK9 and a Bsu36I-digested expression vector, BacPAK6 (Clontech), as described elsewhere (12Kimura I.

RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction–Total RNA was extracted from Neuro2a cells by using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was transcribed from the RNA as a template with Molony murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with TaqDNA polymerase (Japan Gene) and primers specific for the genes examined.

Proteins in the cell lysate were resolved by SDS gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. ERK1/2, Akt, and their phosphorylated forms were detected by Western blotting using antibodies. Primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit antibodies against ERK1/2 (1:1000) (Cell Signaling), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (1:1000) (Cell Signaling), Akt (1:1000) (Cell Signaling), and phosphorylated Akt (1:1000) (Cell Signaling).

Peroxidase Reaction Staining–Recombinant neudesin (1 mg/ml) was incubated with hemin (50 μm) at 24 °C for 30 min. Then, recombinant neudesin, recombinant neudesin with hemin and hemin were subjected to SDS-PAGE without reducing by dithiothreitol. Hemin-containing protein bands were visualized with the peroxidase substrates Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer) as described (18Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Preparation of Neudesin-hemin and Neudesin-protoporphyrin IX–Recombinant neudesin (10 μg) was incubated with hemin (500 μm, if not indicated) or protoporphyrin IX (PP IX, 100 μm) at 24 °C for 30 min. The mixture was applied to a Sephadex™ PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Bound forms (neudesinhemin and neudesin-PP IX) were eluted from the column with PBS containing 10% Me2SO to be separated from hemin and PP IX, respectively. Reduced hemin [Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX] was produced by treating hemin with sodium dithionite. MTT Assay–The survival of Neuro2a cells was evaluated by measuring the activity to reduce MTT. Neuro2a cells were seeded at a density of 0.75 × 105 cells/cm2 in 35-mm dishes. After being cultured in DF containing 10% FBS for 24 h, the cells were further cultured for 3 days in serum-free DF with recombinant neudesin, neudesin-hemin, or hemin. siRNA-transfected Neuro2a cells were seeded at a density of 0.2 × 105 cells/cm2 in 96-well plates. The cells were cultured in DF containing 10% FBS for 24 h and then in DF containing 1% N2 Supplement for 5 days. For MTT-reducing activity, the cells were treated with 0.5 mg/ml MTT (MTT Cell Count Kit; Nakalai) at 37 °C for 4 h. The reduction product, MTT-formazan, was solubilized with isopropyl alcohol. The absorption at 570 nm of each sample solution was measured as the MTT reducing activity of the cells. Cell Survival Activity Assay–Cultured mouse cerebral cortical cells were seeded at a density of 1.3 × 105 cells/cm2 in 35-mm dishes coated with polyethyleneimine. The cells on the fifth day of culture were treated with recombinant neudesin (10 ng/ml), neudesin-hemin (10 ng/ml), hemin (100 nm), or 10% horse serum (HS) for 4 days. For immunostaining, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), washed in PBS, and treated with 5% BSA in PBS. The cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and immunostained with primary antibodies and secondary antibodies. The cells were treated with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After three washes for 5 min each in PBS, the cells were further treated with the secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies used were an anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) mouse monoclonal antibody (1:400; Sigma) and an anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:80; Sigma). Anti-MAP2 antibody and anti-GFAP antibody were used as neuronal and astrocytic markers, respectively. The secondary antibodies used were rhodamine red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies, rhodamine red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies (1:200 each; Sigma). Cell nuclei were counterstained with TOPRO3 (Molecular Probes), and the stained cells were observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope as described previously (12Kimura I. Yoshioka M. Konishi M. Miyake A. Itoh N. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Kimura I. Konishi M. Miyake A. Fujimoto M. Itoh N. J. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 83: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Results are means ± S.E. for five different fields from four independent slides. TUNEL Assay–The presence of DNA breaks was evaluated by a TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) procedure as described previously (19Druzhyna N.M. Musiyenko S.I. Wilson G.L. LeDoux S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21673-21679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For detection and quantitation of apoptotic cells, the DeadEnd fluorometric TUNEL system (Promega) was used. It measures the fragmented DNA of apoptotic cells by catalytically incorporating fluorescein-12-dUTP at 3′-OH DNA ends using the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's direction. Briefly, Neuro2a cells were seeded at a density of 0.75 × 105 cells/cm2 in 35-mm dishes. The cells were cultured for 3 days in the presence of recombinant neudesin, neudesin-hemin, or hemin. siRNA-transfected Neuro2a cells were seeded at a density of 0.2 × 105 cells/cm2 in 35-mm dishes. The transfected Neuro2a cells were cultured in DF containing 10% FBS for 24 h and then in DF containing 1% N2 Supplement for 3 days. Cultured mouse cerebral cortical cells were seeded at a density of 1.3 × 105 cells/cm2 in 35-mm dishes coated with polyethyleneimine. The cells on the fifth day of culture were treated with neudesin (10 ng/ml), neudesin-hemin (10 ng/ml), hemin (100 nm), or 10% HS for 4 days. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Thereafter, DNA strand breaks were labeled with fluorescein-12-dUTP by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme, neurons were stained with anti-MAP2 mouse monoclonal primary antibody (1:400; Sigma) and rhodamine red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:200; Sigma), and the nuclei were stained with TOPRO3 (Molecular Probes). The cells were observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope. Results are means ± S.E. for five different fields from four independent slides. BrdU Assay–Neuro2a cells were plated onto 96-well plates (1 × 103 cells/well) and cultured in DF supplemented with 10% FBS. After 24 h in culture, the cells were cultured in DF supplemented with 0.1% BSA for 24 h. The cells were treated with recombinant neudesin, neudesin-hemin, or hemin. After 16 h, the cells were further cultured for 8 h in the presence of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 10 μm). The mitogenic activity was determined from five independent wells using 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine Labeling and Detection Kit III (Roche Applied Science) as described elsewhere (20Hoshikawa M. Yonamine A. Konishi M. Itoh N. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 105: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Detection of Endogenous Mouse Neudesin–A rabbit anti-neudesin polyclonal antibody was raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 153-171 (PNLDFKPEDQPHFDIKDEF) of mouse neudesin. Endogenous neudesin was detected by using this anti-neudesin antibody by Western blotting. Neuro2a cells were plated onto 10-cm dishes (0.2 × 105 cells/cm2) and cultured in DF supplemented with 10% FBS. After 24 h, the cells were cultured in DF containing 1% N2 supplement for 4 days. The collected culture medium was concentrated by Amicon Centricon YM-10 (Millipore) (1:10). Heme affinity chromatography was performed as described previously (21Hvidberg V. Maniecki M.B. Jacobsen C. Hojrup P. Moller H.J. Moestrup S.K. Blood. 2005; 106: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The concentrated culture medium was loaded on a matrix of cross-linked 4% beaded hemin-agarose (Sigma). After washing with HEPES buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10mm HEPES, and 0.14 m NaCl, pH7.8, bound proteins were eluted in 0.2 m CH3CO2Na, containing 250 mm imidazole (pH 4.0). Primary Structure of Neudesin Includes a Heme/Steroid-binding Domain and Recombinant Mouse Neudesin Contains Hemin–The domain structure of neudesin was explored by inputting its amino acid sequence into a protein domain structure prediction program (Pfam) at the website. The results suggested that neudesin contains a heme/steroid-binding domain similar to the heme-binding domain of cytochrome b5 neudesin belongs to the membrane-associated progesterone receptor (MAPR) family, a subfamily of the cytochrome b5 family, along with PGC1 (membrane-associated progesterone receptor component 1; 25-Dx) (22Mifsud W. Bateman A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 12Crossref Google Scholar, 23Krebs C.J. Jarvis E.D. Chan J. Lydon J.P. Ogawa S. Pfaff D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 23: 12816-12821Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The 134-amino acid human cytochrome b5 has a heme-binding domain (in green in Fig. 1A) in which His-44 and His-68 act as the ligand for the heme iron (24Nakanishi N. Takeuchi F. Okamoto H. Tamura A. Hori H. Tsubaki M. J. Biochem. 2006; 140: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The 195-amino acid human PGC1 has a heme-binding domain exhibited (in blue in Fig. 1A) in which Tyr-81, Tyr-87, and Tyr-111 act as the predicted ligands for the heme iron (25Min L. Strushkevich N.V. Harnastai I.N. Iwamoto H. Gilep A.A. Takemori H. Usanov S.A. Nonaka Y. Hori H. Vinson G.P. Okamoto M. FEBS J. 2005; 22: 5832-5843Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The 172-amino acid human and 171-amino acid mouse neudesins have a signal sequence (31 and 30 amino acids, respectively) at the N terminus. Mouse neudesin has a predicted heme-binding domain (45∼143 amino acids). Moreover, we predicted that Tyr-81, Tyr-87, and His-111 in mouse neudesin act as the ligand for the heme iron (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we produced recombinant His6-fused mouse neudesin and neudesinΔHBD proteins. The recombinant His6-fused mouse neudesinΔHBD protein lacks the heme-binding domain (73-125 amino acids) that includes Tyr-81, Tyr-87, and His-111 (Fig. 1B). Recombinant mouse neudesin, but not neudesinΔHBD, was tinged with green and had a sharp absorbance peak at 402 nm. When recombinant neudesin was treated with sodium dithionite, the peak shifted to 420 nm, as is characteristic of the heme-binding protein (Fig. 1C). Several heme-binding proteins are associated with hemin so tightly that they can be detected as peroxidase reaction-stained bands even when subjected to electrophoresis in SDS-containing gels. Hence, recombinant neudesin was subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent staining by the peroxidase reaction after incubation with or without hemin. The 20-kDa band was only slightly detected in the case of recombinant neudesin, whereas, recombinant neudesin incubated with exogenous hemin was stained more without a change in its molecular mass (Fig. 1D). Association with Hemin Enhances Neurotrophic Activity of Neudesin in Neuro2a Cell–Next, to compare the neurotrophic activity of neudesin-hemin with that of recombinant neudesin, we produced neudesin-hemin by incubating recombinant neudesin with hemin in vitro (26Taketani S. Adachi Y. Kohno H. Ikehara S. Tokunaga R. Ishii T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 47: 31388-31394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recombinant neudesin exhibited significant neurotrophic activity in primary cultured mouse neurons and neural precursor cells (12Kimura I. Yoshioka M. Konishi M. Miyake A. Itoh N. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Kimura I. Konishi M. Miyake A. Fujimoto M. Itoh N. J. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 83: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). First, we examined the neurotrophic activity of neudesin-hemin in mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro2a cells) by conducting a MTT assay. Neudesin-hemin significantly enhanced the survival of Neuro2a cells in a dose-dependent manner. However, Neuro2a cells were not affected by recombinant neudesin (Fig. 2, A and B), different from primary cultured mouse neurons and neural precursor cells (12Kimura I. Yoshioka M. Konishi M. Miyake A. Itoh N. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Kimura I. Konishi M. Miyake A. Fujimoto M. Itoh N. J. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 83: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We also examined the mitogenic activity of neudesin-hemin in Neuro2a cells by conducting a BrdU assay. We found that neudesin-hemin exhibited more significant mitogenic activity than recombinant neudesin (Fig. 2C). Moreover, to confirm the survival-promoting activity of neudesin-hemin, we performed a TUNEL assay. Neudesin-hemin, but not recombinant neudesin, significantly decreased the number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells (Fig. 2, D and E). Because the neurotrophic activity of neudesin in primary cultured neurons and neural precursor cells is mediated through the MAPK and PI-3K pathways as described previously (12Kimura I. Yoshioka M. Konishi M. Miyake A. Itoh N. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Kimura I. Konishi M. Miyake A. Fujimoto M. Itoh N. J. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 83: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of neudesin-hemin on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt also in Neuro2a cells. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt was remarkably promoted by neudesin-hemin, but not by recombinant neudesin (Fig. 2F). Association with Hemin Enhances Neurotrophic Activity of Neudesin in Primary Cultured Cortical Neurons–Recombinant neudesin shows neurotrophic activity in primary cultured mouse neurons (12Kimura I. Yoshioka M. Konishi M. Miyake A. Itoh N. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the activity of neudesin-hemin with that of recombinant neudesin in primary cultured mouse cerebral cortical neurons. Neudesin-hemin exhibited a more significant neuroprotective effect in primary neurons than did recombinant neudesin. Under the same conditions, hemin alone did not exhibit any significant effect (Fig. 3, A and B). In the TUNEL assay, neudesin-hemin significantly decreased the number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells (Fig. 3, C and D), but the activity of neudesin-hemin was not greater than that of recombinant neudesin. Therefore, we examined the effect of neudesin-hemin or recombinant neudesin over a shorter period (30 min of incubation), on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt, in primary cultured neurons. Neudesin-hemin promoted the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt more remarkably than did recombinant neudesin (Fig. 3E). As shown in (Fig. 3, F and G) neudesinΔHBD without the ability to bind heme did not exhibit the neurotrophic activity and did not promote the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. These results suggest that the ability to bind heme is essential for the activity of neudesin. Activity of Neudesin-Hemin Requires Fe(III)–We next examined whether the activities of neudesin are dependent on the amount of hemin-bound neudesin. First, we prepared a series of neudesin-hemin samples by changing the ratio of hemin to neudesin. Then, we examined the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 induced by a series of neudesin-hemin preparations. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was dependent on the hemin added in a ratio-dependent manner under a fixed concentration of recombinant neudesin (Fig. 4A). Cytochrome b5 has Fe(III)-protoporphyrin IX as hemin in a normal state. We examined whether the activity of neudesin is dependent on hemin[Fe(III)-protoporphyrin IX] or reduced hemin [Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX] by reducing Fe(III) to Fe(II) with sodium dithionite. Neudesin-hemin containing Fe(III), but not Fe(II), promoted the phosphorylation IX of ERK1/2. Free Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX, but not Fe(III)-protoporphyrin, promoted the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in primary cultured neurons (Fig. 4B). Neudesin-PP IX (protoporphyrin IX-bound neudesin) little promoted the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, similar to recombinant neudesin (Fig. 4C). Inhibition of Endogenous Neudesin Decreases Cell Survival and Proliferation in Neuro2a Cells–To elucidate the neurotrophic activity of endogenous neudesin, we examined the effect of neudesin RNAi in Neuro2a. The RT-PCR experiment revealed that the first target neudesin siRNA, but not the control siRNA, suppressed neudesin expression (Fig. 5A). We also found that the first target nedesin siRNA significantly decreased cell survival and cell proliferation in Neuro2a cells in the MTT assay and BrdU assay, respectively (Fig. 5, B and C). The first target neudesin siRNA significantly increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the Neuro2a population (Fig. 5, D and E). Likewise, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 or Akt was remarkably suppressed by the first target neudesin siRNA (Fig. 5F). The second and third target neudesin siRNA also gave the same results as the first one (supplemental Fig. S1). Detection of Endogenous Mouse Neudesin–Last, we attempted to detect endogenous neudesin in the culture medium of Neuro2a cells by using anti-neudesin antibodies. A major band of 15.6 kDa was detected in the culture medium (Fig. 6A). The observed molecular weight was consistent with the putative molecular weight of mature neudesin. A few heme-binding proteins such as hemopexin have been purified using heme affinity chromatography (21Hvidberg V. Maniecki M.B. Jacobsen C. Hojrup P. Moller H.J. Moestrup S.K. Blood. 2005; 106: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). To examine whether endogenous neudesin is associated with hemin, we performed heme-affinity chromatography. Almost all the endogenous neudesin was recovered in the pass-through fraction, whereas the recombinant neudesin was not recovered in the pass-through fraction at all (Fig. 6B). These results mean that the endogenous neudesin produced by Neuro2a cells binds hemin. Neudesin, a novel secreted neurotrophic factor, belongs to the membrane-associated progesterone receptor (MAPR) family, a subfamily of the cytochrome b5 family, which possesses a cytochrome b5-like heme/steroid-binding domain (22Mifsud W. Bateman A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 12Crossref Google Scholar). It was reported in 1996 that MAPRs, discovered as progesterone-binding proteins (27Meyer C. Schmid R. Scriba P.C. Wehling M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 28Selmin O. Lucier G.W. Clark G.C. Tritscher A.M. Vanden Heuvel J.P. Gastel J.A. Walker N.J. Sutter T.R. Bell D.A. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2609-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 29Labombarda F. Gonzalez S.L. Deniselle M.C. Vinson G.P. Schumacher M. De Nicola A.F. Guennoun R. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 902-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), contain a cytochrome b5-like heme/steroid-binding domain, suggesting that MAPRs interact also with heme (30Min L. Takemori H. Nonaka Y. Katoh Y. Doi J. Horike N. Osamu H. Raza F.S. Vinson G.P. Okamoto M. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2004; 215: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In fact, the adrenal inner zone antigen (IZA) purified as a heme-binding protein was shown to be identical with a MAPR, 25-Dx (25Min L. Strushkevich N.V. Harnastai I.N. Iwamoto H. Gilep A.A. Takemori H. Usanov S.A. Nonaka Y. Hori H. Vinson G.P. Okamoto M. FEBS J. 2005; 22: 5832-5843Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These reports led us to examine whether neudesin can bind steroids, in particular progesterone, and/or heme. First, we tested the binding of several steroids including progesterone to neudesin by dot blotting, but found that neudesin could bind no steroids at all (data not shown). Next, we attempted to check the hemin binding to neudesin by measuring hemin-specific absorbance. Hemin and reduced hemin show specific peaks of absorbance at 402 and 420 nm, respectively. Purified mouse recombinant neudesin seemed to bind hemin that was added exogenously, while neudesinΔHBD, a mutant lacking the heme-binding domain, only minimally bound exogenous hemin. Furthermore, we found that recombinant neudesin itself bound hemin because it was tinged with faint green and a 20-kDa band was slightly detected after SDS-PAGE following the peroxidase reaction. Compared with this, the peroxidase reaction on the gel for SDS-PAGE performed after incubation with hemin revealed that recombinant neudesin could bind exogenous hemin extensively. In most cases where heme-binding proteins are produced in a baculovirus/insect cell expression system, the addition of exogenous hemin to the culture medium is necessary for full biological activity because insect cells cannot provide enough hemin for the mass production of heme-binding proteins (31Seo H.G. Fujii J. Soejima H. Niikawa N. Taniguchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This was also the case with neudesin. The functional activity of neudesin-hemin was examined using Neuro2a cells. Neudesin-hemin, but not recombinant neudesin or hemin alone, showed neurotrophic and neuroprotective activities. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt was remarkably promoted also only by neudesin-hemin, not by recombinant neudesin or hemin alone. The iron in hemin seemed to be necessary for the activity, because neudesin-protoporphyrin IX was little able to enhance the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, Fe(III), but not Fe(II), in hemin was required for the activity of the neudesinhemin complex because the complex-induced enhancement of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt disappeared with the reduction of iron in hemin to Fe(II) by the sodium dithionite (Fig. 4B). It is not plausible that hemin dissociated from the complex bears the activity of neudesin because hemin alone has no effect on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt although reduced hemin alone showed some activity. Nor is it plausible that neudesin protects neuronal cells from the cytotoxic effect of free hemin because hemin alone has no effect on the neuronal cell survival (Figs. 2 and 3). Recombinant neudesin did not have any significant effect on cell survival, cell proliferation, or the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt in Neuro2a cells. In contrast, in primary cultured neurons, recombinant neudesin exhibited significant neurotrophic activity and weak enhancement of the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt (12Kimura I. Yoshioka M. Konishi M. Miyake A. Itoh N. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because neudesinΔHBD did not exhibit neurotrophic activity in primary cultured neurons, heme may be indispensable for the neurotrophic activity of neudesin in primary neurons. Primary cultured neurons may be sensitive enough to respond to a very small amount of neudesin-hemin that was included in the recombinant neudesin as mentioned above. Another possibility is that hemin, which is released from dying primary cultured neurons in a time-dependent manner, may be associated with hemin-free neudesin during incubation. This is consistent with the result that, in primary cultured neurons, neudesin had only a weak effect on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt which was examined with 30 min of incubation, while neudesin had a significant effect on the neurotrophic activity examined with 4 days of incubation. As described above, exogenous neudesin seems to require hemin for its biological activity. Then, does endogenous neudesin contain hemin? In other words, does endogenous neudesin have biological activity? To answer this question, we examined the inhibition of endogenous neudesin in Neuro2a cells with RNAi. Neudesin siRNA, but not control siRNA, sufficiently reduced cellular viability. The results suggest that endogenous neudesin is involved in the cellular function and contains hemin, because Neuro2a have no response to recombinant neudesin. Furthermore, we detected endogenous neudesin of 15.6 kDa, a molecular weight predictive of mature neudesin, by using anti-neudesin peptide antibodies. When the culture medium of Neuro2a cells was applied to a heme-affinity column, by which hemopexin, a plasma heme-binding protein, was isolated from human serum (21Hvidberg V. Maniecki M.B. Jacobsen C. Hojrup P. Moller H.J. Moestrup S.K. Blood. 2005; 106: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), the neudesin immunoreactivity was detected in the pass-through fraction, strongly suggesting that endogenous neudesin is already associated with hemin. A lot of proteins require heme for their biological activity as a prosthetic group, such as guanylate cyclase concerned with cGMP synthesis (10Denninger J.W. Marletta M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar), NPAS2 concerned with circadian rhythm (32Dioum E.M. Rutter J. Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 2002; 298: 2385-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), DGCR8 concerned with microRNA synthesis (11Faller M. Matsunaga M. Yin S. Loo J.A. Guo F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), nitricoxide synthases concerned with NO synthesis (33Sono M. Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. Dawson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19943-19948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and cytochrome b concerned with steroidogenesis (10Denninger J.W. Marletta M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). However, all are intracellular proteins. Although hemopexin is the only such protein that is extracellular, its function other than as a carrier of heme has not been reported. Neudesin may be the first extracellular heme-binding protein known to be involved in intercellular signal transduction. The attempt to detect its molecular target, a receptor associated with neudesin, is now under investigation. In conclusion, we report that neudesin is a heme-binding protein and its neurotrophic activity requires the attachment of hemin [Fe(III)-protoporphyrin IX] to its heme-binding domain. In addition, neudesin is the first novel extracellular heme-binding protein with intrinsic signal transducing activity. Elucidation of the precise function of neudesin may provide new insights into the physiological role of heme-binding proteins. Download .pdf (.08 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2024123477,"Trypanosoma cruzi is the protozoan parasite that causes Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis. Kinetoplastid parasites could be considered as model organisms for studying factors involved in posttranscriptional regulation because they control gene expression almost exclusively at this level. The PUF (Pumilio/FBF1) protein family regulates mRNA stability and translation in eukaryotes, and several members have been identified in trypanosomatids. We used a ribonomic approach to identify the putative target mRNAs associated with TcPUF6, a member of the T. cruzi PUF family. TcPUF6 is expressed in discrete sites in the cytoplasm at various stages of the parasite life cycle and is not associated with the translation machinery. The overexpression of a tandem affinity purification-tagged TcPUF6 protein allowed the identification of associated mRNAs by affinity purification assays and microarray hybridization yielding nine putative target mRNAs. Whole expression analysis of transfected parasites showed that the mRNAs associated with TcPUF6 were down-regulated in populations overexpressing TcPUF6. The association of TcPUF6 with the TcDhh1 helicase in vivo and the cellular co-localization of these proteins in epimastigote forms suggest that TcPUF6 promotes degradation of its associated mRNAs through interaction with RNA degradation complexes. Analysis of the mRNA levels of the putative TcPUF6-regulated genes during the parasite life cycle showed that their transcripts were up-regulated in metacyclic trypomastigotes. In these infective forms no co-localization between TcPUF6 and TcDhh1 was observed. Our results suggest that TcPUF6 regulates the half-lives of its associated transcripts via differential association with mRNA degradation complexes throughout its life cycle. Trypanosoma cruzi is the protozoan parasite that causes Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis. Kinetoplastid parasites could be considered as model organisms for studying factors involved in posttranscriptional regulation because they control gene expression almost exclusively at this level. The PUF (Pumilio/FBF1) protein family regulates mRNA stability and translation in eukaryotes, and several members have been identified in trypanosomatids. We used a ribonomic approach to identify the putative target mRNAs associated with TcPUF6, a member of the T. cruzi PUF family. TcPUF6 is expressed in discrete sites in the cytoplasm at various stages of the parasite life cycle and is not associated with the translation machinery. The overexpression of a tandem affinity purification-tagged TcPUF6 protein allowed the identification of associated mRNAs by affinity purification assays and microarray hybridization yielding nine putative target mRNAs. Whole expression analysis of transfected parasites showed that the mRNAs associated with TcPUF6 were down-regulated in populations overexpressing TcPUF6. The association of TcPUF6 with the TcDhh1 helicase in vivo and the cellular co-localization of these proteins in epimastigote forms suggest that TcPUF6 promotes degradation of its associated mRNAs through interaction with RNA degradation complexes. Analysis of the mRNA levels of the putative TcPUF6-regulated genes during the parasite life cycle showed that their transcripts were up-regulated in metacyclic trypomastigotes. In these infective forms no co-localization between TcPUF6 and TcDhh1 was observed. Our results suggest that TcPUF6 regulates the half-lives of its associated transcripts via differential association with mRNA degradation complexes throughout its life cycle. The kinetoplastid parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis, which affects several million people in South and Central America. During its life cycle, T. cruzi invades two different hosts: a reduviid insect and a mammal. The parasite has at least four distinct and well defined developmental stages: replicative epimastigotes, the infective metacyclic and cellular trypomastigotes, and replicative intracellular amastigotes (1De Souza W. Kinetoplastid Biol. Dis. 2002; 31: 1-3Google Scholar). The developmental forms differ in terms of the environment they inhabit, metabolic activity, and ability to invade different host cells. Consequently, tight regulation of gene expression is required to allow the rapid adaptation essential for parasite survival. Gene expression in trypanosomes differs from that of higher eukaryotes and involves unusual mechanisms, such as polycistronic transcription, the editing of mitochondrial transcripts, and the addition of a 5′ mini exon sequence by trans-splicing and of the 3′ poly(A) tail to mRNA in a coupled reaction. No canonical RNA polymerase II promoter has yet been identified, and there is no clear evidence of transcriptional regulation for protein coding genes (2Clayton C.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Because the individual genes present in a given polycistronic unit may show different temporal expression patterns, the regulation of gene expression in trypanosomes is thought to be posttranscriptional (2Clayton C.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 3Teixeira S.M. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1998; 31: 1503-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, posttranscriptional regulation mechanisms allow rapid and efficient responses to environmental changes and physiological conditions. Detailed characterization of the regulatory processes involved and of the various components of the posttranscriptional machinery is needed. However, such studies have been hampered by the need to separate the effects of posttranscriptional control from the mechanisms regulating transcription initiation. Trypanosomatids, which lack transcriptional regulation, provide an excellent noise-free model for studying the posttranscriptional control of gene expression, the gene regulatory networks controlled at this level, and the macromolecular machineries involved. Posttranscriptional regulation involves specific interactions between regulatory trans-acting factors and conserved cis-elements present in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTR) 2The abbreviations used are:UTRuntranslated regionTAPtandem affinity purificationPEPCKphosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. of the transcripts (4Mignone F. Gissi C. Liuini S. Pesole G. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 0004.1-0004.10Crossref Google Scholar). RNA-binding proteins bind to sequence-specific and/or structural elements in the UTR regions of functionally related mRNAs, modulating their expression (5Auweter S.D. Oberstrass F.C. Allain F.H.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4943-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 6Keene J.D. Tenenbaum S.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1161-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). RNA-binding proteins can be classified into different families according to their structural features. The PUF (Pumilio/FBF1) family of posttranscriptional regulators is widespread among eukaryotes and has been the focus of intense studies in recent years. PUF proteins are defined by the presence of a Pumilio domain consisting of eight imperfect repeats and carboxyl- and amino-terminally flanking regions. Each repeat folds into three α-helices, which face the internal side of a rainbow-shaped structure. RNA binds to the α-helices present on the concave surface of the protein, this RNA recognition system being highly modular (7Wang X. McLachlan J. Zamore P.D. Tanaka Hall T.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The recognition motif has been identified for Drosophila, yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, mouse, and human PUF proteins. Most PUF family proteins bind sequences containing an UGUR core motif, with the flanking sequences controlling the target specificity of each PUF protein (7Wang X. McLachlan J. Zamore P.D. Tanaka Hall T.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 8Wickens M. Bernstein D.S. Kimble J. Parker R.

PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 342-354Crossref Scopus (519) Google Scholar). PUF proteins regulate mRNA stability and translation by enhancing the deadenylation and subsequent degradation of mRNAs or repressing translation initiation (8Wickens M. Bernstein D.S. Kimble J. Parker R. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 150-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 10Wharton R.P. Aggarwal A.K. Sci. STKE 2006. 2006; : pe37Google Scholar). Interactions between the yeast PUF protein Mpt5p (or PUF5) and deadenylating complexes have recently been described, and such interactions are conserved throughout evolution in eukaryotes (11Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Mpt5p interacts directly with the Pop2p nuclease, which is part of the Ccr4p-Pop2p-Not deadenylase complex. This protein bridges the interaction with the Dhh1 helicase, which is also involved in mRNA storage and degradation (12Coller J.M. Tucker M. Sheth U. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Parker R. RNA. 2001; 7: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Affinity tag purification and microarray analysis have shown that each PUF protein binds and regulates a functionally and cytotopically related subpopulation of mRNAs in yeast (9Gerber A.P. Herschlag D. Brown P.O. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 342-354Crossref Scopus (519) Google Scholar). untranslated region tandem affinity purification phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Several conserved PUF proteins have been identified in the genomes of kinetoplastida. In T. cruzi, the PUF protein family has 10 members. Based on in silico analysis, they can be assigned to three groups according to putative binding specificity (13Caro F. Bercovich N. Atorrasagasti C. Levin M.J. Vazquez M.P. Exp. Parasitol. 2006; 113: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We have previously described and characterized TcPUF6, a member of this family (14Dallagiovanna B. Perez L. Sotelo-Silveira J. Smircich P. Duhagon M.A. Garat B. Exp. Parasitol. 2005; 109: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). TcPUF6 is an ortholog of the Trypanosoma brucei protein TbPUF1 (15Hoek M. Zanders T. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 57: 706-716Google Scholar). T. cruzi PUF6 protein is produced constitutively, throughout the life of the parasite. The protein is present in the cytoplasm of the replicative epimastigote forms in multiple discrete foci, a characteristic pattern also observed for members of the yeast PUF family (9Gerber A.P. Herschlag D. Brown P.O. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 342-354Crossref Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and other trypanosome PUF proteins (13Caro F. Bercovich N. Atorrasagasti C. Levin M.J. Vazquez M.P. Exp. Parasitol. 2006; 113: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Hoek M. Zanders T. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 57: 706-716Google Scholar). We used a ribonomic approach (16Keene J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7018-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 17Tenenbaum S.A. Lager P.J. Carson C.C. Keene J.D. Methods. 2002; 26: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) to identify the putative target mRNAs associated with TcPUF6. The overexpression of a TAP-tagged TcPUF6 protein did not affect growth rate or morphology. Microarray analysis of affinity-purified transcripts and whole expression of the transfected parasites showed that mRNAs associated with TcPUF6 were down-regulated in parasites overexpressing TcPUF6. We assessed the in vivo association of TcPUF6 with the TcDhh1 helicase by immunoprecipitation, TAP-Tag assays, and immunofluorescence co-localization assays. Parasites—T. cruzi clone Dm28c (18Contreras V.T. Araujo-Jorge T.C. Bonaldo M.C. Thomaz N. Barbosa H.S. Meirelles M. de N. Goldenberg S. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 1988; 83: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) was used throughout this work. Epimastigote forms were maintained at 28 °C in liver infusion tryptose medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Metacyclic trypomastigotes and extracellular amastigotes were prepared as described by Contreras et al. (19Contreras V.T. Salles J.M. Thomas N. Morel C.M. Goldenberg S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 20Contreras V.T. Navarro M.C. DeLima A.R. Arteaga R. Duran F. Askue J. Franco Y. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 2002; 97: 1213-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence and Imaging—Immunofluorescence assays were performed as previously described by Holetz et al. (21Holetz F. Correa A. Avila A.R. Nakamura C.V. Krieger M.A. Goldenberg S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 356: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Serum dilutions were: rabbit anti-TcPUF6 1:50 and mouse anti-TcDhh1 1:20. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:400) (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) were used. The cells were stained with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (1:2000; Sigma). Subcellular localization images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope coupled to a Cool SANP-PRO color camera (Media Cybernetics). The merged images were obtained by superimposing image files in the Image-PRO PLUS software V6.2 (Media Cybernetics). Sucrose Density Gradient Separation and Polysome Analysis—T. cruzi polysomes were purified and separated on sucrose gradients, using a modified version of the method described by Brecht and Parsons (22Brecht M. Parsons M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cultures of 5 × 108 epimastigotes were lysed in buffer A (300 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% Nonidet P-40, and 2 m sucrose) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (400 μl) was layered onto 15 to 55% sucrose density gradients prepared in buffer B plus inhibitors (300 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, 10 μm E-64, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml heparin) and centrifuged at 4 °C for 2 h at 39,000 rpm in a Beckman SW40 rotor. As a control, the cells were preincubated with 2 mm of Puromycin for 1 h at 28 °C before being lysed. Gradients were fractionated using an ISCO Foxy Jr. collection system with pump speed set to 1 ml/min, a fraction time of 30 s/fraction, and a chart speed of 60 cm/h. For Western blot analysis, 30-μl aliquots of the indicated fractions were boiled for 5 min with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. RNA Preparations—Total RNA was extracted from 5 × 108 exponentially growing epimastigote forms, using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Linearly amplified RNA was generated from 1 μg of total RNA (single round), using the MessageAmp amplified RNA kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's manual. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total or affinity-purified RNAs using an oligo(dT) primer (US Biochemical Corp.) and reverse transcriptase (IMPROM II, Promega) as recommended. Microarray Hybridization and Analysis—Fluorescent cyanin (Cy) dyes Cy3 or Cy5, as appropriate were incorporated into the second strand of the cDNA, using 2 μg of amplified RNA as the starting material for each sample. The labeled cDNA was purified with a Microcom 30 device (Millipore). Microarray hybridizations and washes were carried out in a GeneTac automated hybridization station (Genomic Solutions). The Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNAs were mixed and added to 120 μl of hybridization solution and allowed to hybridize for 14–16 h at 42 °C. The microarray slides were then washed in buffers of increasing stringency (0.5× and 0.05× SSC) and dried by centrifugation at 280 × g for 5 min. The dried slides were scanned in a 428 Array Scanner (Affymetrix). The images were analyzed with Spot software. The resulting data were corrected for background and normalized, using the normexp and PrintTip-Loess methods, respectively, within the Limma package (24Smyth G.K. Stat. App. Genet. Mol. Biol. 2004; 3 (article 3)PubMed Google Scholar). Microarray results were confirmed by quantitative PCR, as previously described (25Nardelli S.C. Avila A.R. Freund A. Motta M.C. Manhaes L. de Jesus T.C. Schenkman S. Fragoso S.P. Krieger M.A. Goldenberg S. Dallagiovanna B. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Two-step real time reverse transcription-PCR assays were carried out with an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Tandem Affinity Purification and Immunoprecipitation Assays—For TAP-Tag assays, the coding sequence of the TcPUF6 gene inserted into a pTEXTAPTAG vector 3E.

Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). T. cruzi epimastigotes (5 × 107) were transfected with 50 μg of vector DNA by electroporation in 4-mm cuvettes, using the Bio-Rad GenePulser II electroporator, with two pulses of 450 V and 500 millifarads. We added 250 μg/ml geneticin 24 h after electroporation, for the selection of transfected parasites. After 72 h, the cultures were diluted 1:4, and the concentration of geneticin was increased to 500 μg/ml. Transfectants were cloned by serial dilution in 24-well plates and cultured in the presence of 500 μg/ml of geneticin. TAP-Tag assays of bound proteins and RNAs were performed as previously described (9Gerber A.P. Herschlag D. Brown P.O. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 342-354Crossref Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 17Tenenbaum S.A. Lager P.J. Carson C.C. Keene J.D. Methods. 2002; 26: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The soluble cytosolic fraction was prepared from 1010 exponentially growing epimastigote forms at a final concentration of 109/ml of polysome lysis buffer (100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, and 1% Nonidet P-40). The parasites were lysed for 1 h at 4 °C (17Tenenbaum S.A. Lager P.J. Carson C.C. Keene J.D. Methods. 2002; 26: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Lysed parasites were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were immediately used in affinity purification assays. The tagged proteins were purified on IgG-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences). They were washed three times and treated with 200 units/ml of TEV protease (Invitrogen), as previously described (26Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). Eluted RNAs were purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and amplified using the cRNA amplification kit (Ambion), following the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed as previously described (17Tenenbaum S.A. Lager P.J. Carson C.C. Keene J.D. Methods. 2002; 26: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Antiserum against TcPUF6 or TcDhh1 (50 μl) was incubated with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose or protein G-agarose beads (Sigma), respectively, overnight at 4 °C. The beads were blocked by incubation in 5% skim milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline. The soluble cytosolic fraction was prepared from 109 exponentially growing epimastigote forms. Conjugated beads were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of the soluble protein fraction. Bound proteins were washed three times with ten column volumes of polysome lysis buffer and eluted with one volume of 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.3. For RNA immunoprecipitation assays 50 μl of anti-TcPUF6 and preimmune serum were used as previously described. Eluted RNAs were purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) concentrated on microcon devices and immediately converted to cDNA as described. Similar volumes of the resulting cDNAs were subjected to PCR amplification. PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 26 cycles of 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for all the genes studied. Primer sets are listed in supplemental Table S2. Western Blot Analysis—Protein extracts from epimastigotes in the exponential growth phase were prepared and separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% acrylamide gels, electrotransferred onto Hybond-C membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and incubated with the different polyclonal sera as previously described (14Dallagiovanna B. Perez L. Sotelo-Silveira J. Smircich P. Duhagon M.A. Garat B. Exp. Parasitol. 2005; 109: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Sigma) diluted 1/7.500. For relative protein quantification, band densitometry was performed with One DScan E X 3.1 software (Scanalytic), using wild-type TcPUF6 protein levels as a reference. Before each microarray hybridization or affinity purification assay, Western blots were performed to confirm the overexpression of the tagged protein. Quantitative PCR—Two-step real time reverse transcription-PCR assays were performed using the ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) as previously described (25Nardelli S.C. Avila A.R. Freund A. Motta M.C. Manhaes L. de Jesus T.C. Schenkman S. Fragoso S.P. Krieger M.A. Goldenberg S. Dallagiovanna B. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In brief, amplifications were carried out in triplicate with 10 ng of cDNA and the recommended concentration of SYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems). Primer sets are listed in supplemental Table S2. PCR conditions were as follows: 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for all genes studied or 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 70 °C for 1 min for control genes. Thermal dissociation confirmed that reverse transcription-PCR generated a single amplicon. For relative quantification, the standard curve method was used, based on cycle threshold values. 1:5 dilutions of known concentrations of cDNA were used to generate curves extending from 80 pg to 50 ng of cDNA. A standard curve was generated for each of the genes studied and both control genes. Gene expression was normalized against TcL9 or TcH2B control genes (25Nardelli S.C. Avila A.R. Freund A. Motta M.C. Manhaes L. de Jesus T.C. Schenkman S. Fragoso S.P. Krieger M.A. Goldenberg S. Dallagiovanna B. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The results are expressed as fold changes of gene expression in metacyclic trypomastigotes using epimastigotes as the reference population. Cellular Localization of TcPUF6 in the Different Stage Forms—We have previously shown that TcPUF6 is present in multiple discrete foci in the cytoplasm of the replicative epimastigote forms. However, given the differences between the developmental stages of T. cruzi, we conceived that TcPUF6 might be distributed differently in nonreplicative, infective metacyclic trypomastigotes and in replicative intracellular amastigote forms. We used a previously described polyclonal TcPUF6 antiserum (14Dallagiovanna B. Perez L. Sotelo-Silveira J. Smircich P. Duhagon M.A. Garat B. Exp. Parasitol. 2005; 109: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to determine the distribution of the protein in cells. In both cellular forms, TcPUF6 was localized in discrete cytoplasmic foci (supplemental Fig. S1). TcPUF6 Is Localized in Ribosome-free Regions of the Cytoplasm—It has been suggested that PUF proteins bind to functionally related mRNAs and localize them in specific cytoplasmic regions. We analyzed the possible association of TcPUF6 with polysomes. Exponentially growing epimastigotes were treated with cycloheximide to trap the mRNAs on the elongating ribosomes. Polysome profiles were obtained from sucrose gradients loaded with the soluble cytoplasmic fractions in three independent assays (Fig. 1a). As a control, the polysome-enriched fraction was treated with EDTA or puromycin prior centrifugation to dissociate the ribosomal subunits from the mRNAs (not shown). Western blot analysis of the different fractions showed that TcPUF6 co-sedimented with the ribosome-free fractions in all three experiments (collected fractions 1–3). No signal was detected with polysomes or monosomes (Fig. 1b). An antiserum against T. cruzi eIF3 translation initiation factor subunit Tif34 was used as a control of a polysome associated protein. 4S. P. Fragoso, personal communication. A signal corresponding to the TcTif34 protein was found in fractions along the entire gradient in all of the experiments (Fig. 1c). As negative control, an anti-PEPCK serum was tested, and the corresponding signal was found up to fractions 6–9 depending on the assay analyzed (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, we used confocal microscopy to perform co-localization assays with the anti-TcPUF6 serum and a commercial antiserum against human ribosomal P-proteins (Immunovision). Our results showed that TcPUF6 was not present in the ribosome-rich regions of the cytoplasm (supplemental Fig. S2g). We also investigated possible associations between TcPUF6 and actively translating ribosomes. Co-localization assays were performed with two different antisera raised against two subunits, Tif34 and Ptr1, of T. cruzi eIF3. No clear co-localization was observed with either the Ptr1 subunit (supplemental Fig. S2h) or the Tif34 subunit (not shown). Thus, TcPUF6 is present in the cytoplasm and is not associated with ribosomes or polysomes. Overexpression of a TAP-tagged TcPUF6 Protein Does Not Affect Differentiation Phenotype—A TAP-tagged TcPUF6 protein was overexpressed in epimastigote forms to identify the mRNAs associated with TcPUF6 and to obtain additional information about protein function. We used the pTEX vector, which is maintained as a low copy number episomal DNA with discrete overexpression (27Kelly J.M. Ward H.M. Miles M.A. Kendall G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3963-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), to facilitate the purification of mRNP complexes without affecting the cellular distribution of the protein. Two clonal populations derived from independent transfection assays were selected. These populations, PUF6A and PUF6B, overexpressed a protein of about 90 kDa in size resulting from the fusion of TcPUF6 with the 30-kDa tag. The level of overexpression was analyzed by Western blotting, using different concentrations of total protein extract, with in silico quantification by peptide densitometry, using the wild-type protein as a reference. The fusion protein was overexpressed by factors of three and five in the PUF6 A and B populations, respectively (Fig. 1e). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed with both the anti-TcPUF6 and an anti-tag serum and showed that the characteristic cellular distribution of TcPUF6 was maintained in the transfected parasites (Fig. 1h). Parasites overexpressing the TcPUF6-tagged protein showed no significant change in cell growth rate or morphology; parasites transfected with the pTEX-TAPTAG vector were used as the reference population. The ability of the TcPUF6-overexpressing parasites to differentiate was also analyzed in vitro, and no significant difference in differentiation rates following metacyclogenesis and amastigogenesis in vitro were observed (not shown). Microarray Analysis of TcPUF6-overexpressing Parasites—We investigated the phenotypic changes caused by TcPUF6 at the molecular level, using DNA microarray hybridization to study the steady-state mRNA levels of parasites transfected with vector alone and epimastigotes overexpressing TcPUF6. A T. cruzi cDNA microarray containing ∼6,200 independent probes was analyzed by competitive hybridization, using an amplified cRNA derived from the total RNA of both populations (supplemental Figs. S3 and S4). TcPUF6 overexpression had a considerable effect on global gene expression. We simplified the analysis by considering only genes showing changes in mRNA levels by at least a factor of three. Overall, 269 genes fulfilled this condition, corresponding to about 4% of the sequences present in the microarray. From these genes, 232 were up-regulated in the TcPUF6 transfectants, whereas 37 were clearly down-regulated (supplemental Table S1). The TcPUF6 transcript itself increased in abundance by a factor of 4.5, consistent with Western blotting data (Fig. 1e). The genes selected were identified as putative RNA-binding proteins (9Gerber A.P. Herschlag D. Brown P.O. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 342-354Crossref Scopus (519) Google Scholar), proteases (11Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Parasitol. 2006; 113: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and 48 enzymes involved in central metabolism. However, about 50% of the sequences analyzed were classified as hypothetical proteins (122 sequences) (supplemental Table S1). An analysis of the biological process potentially affected by changes in TcPUF6 levels showed that the up-regulated probes included genes encoding proteins involved in DNA metabolism, stress responses, cytoskeleton and mitochondrial proteins, an"

To explore the functional role of DSCR1 and the regulation of its expression, we searched for novel DSCR1-interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid assay. Using a human fetal brain library, we found that DSCR1 interacts with NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). Furthermore, we demonstrate that NIK specifically interacts with and phosphorylates the C-terminal region of DSCR1 in immortalized hippocampal cells as well as in primary cortical neurons. This NIK-mediated phosphorylation of DSCR1 increases its protein stability and blocks its proteasomal degradation, the effects of which lead to an increase in soluble and insoluble DSCR1 levels. We show that an increase in insoluble DSCR1 levels results in the formation of cytosolic aggregates. Interestingly, we found that whereas the formation of these inclusions does not significantly alter the viability of neuronal cells, the overexpression of DSCR1 without the formation of aggregates is cytotoxic. Down syndrome, the most frequent genetic disorder, is characterized by an extra copy of all or part of chromosome 21.

Patients with DS display many typical phenotypes, such as immune deficiency, characteristic facial features, mental retardation, congenital heart disease, and early onset Alzheimer disease-like symptoms (1Epstein C.J.

Down syndrome candidate region 1 (DSCR1, also called as Adapt78, MCIP1, calcipressin 1, or RCAN1) gene is located near the Down syndrome critical region of chromosome 21 (5Fuentes J.J.

BMC Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is highly expressed in the brain, heart, and skeletal muscles of DS fetuses (7Fuentes J.J. Pritchard M.A. Planas A.M. Bosch A. Ferrer I. Estivill X. Hum. Mol.

DSCR1 has been proposed to be a feedback inhibitor of calcineurin based on two controversial findings. First, the overexpression of DSCR1 suppresses calcineurin signaling, and second, calcineurin activity in the hearts of DSCR1 knock-out mice is greatly diminished (9Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Yang J.

Moreover, the proper expression of DSCR1 appears to be linked to inflammation, angiogenesis, and cardiac development (11Harris C.D. Ermak G. Davies K.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2477-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Hesser B.A. Liang X.H. Camenisch G. Yang S. Lewin D.A. Scheller R. Ferrara N. Gerber H.P.

NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), a Ser/Thr kinase, is a member of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase family. It preferentially phosphorylates and therefore activates IκB kinase α (IKKα) (15Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 16Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). NIK and IKKα are known to induce the processing of p100 and the generation of p52, thereby activating the alternative NF-κB pathway (17Dejardin E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1161-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Although the physiological role of NIK in NF-κB signaling is unclear, gene knock-out studies have suggested that NIK regulates the transcriptional activity of NF-κB in a receptor-restricted manner, such as by both tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β (18Yin L. Wu L. Wesche H. Arthur C.D. White J.M. Goeddel D.V. Schreiber R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 2162-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). NIK-/- cells are also unable to induce NF-κB-dependent gene transcription in response to treatment with lymphotoxin-β despite IκBα degradation (18Yin L. Wu L. Wesche H. Arthur C.D. White J.M. Goeddel D.V. Schreiber R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 2162-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). NIK has both functional nuclear import and export signals that result in its continuous shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, which suggests that NIK, like IKKα, has an intranuclear function (19Birbach A. Bailey S.T. Ghosh S. Schmid J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3615-3624Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The nuclear factors of activated T cells (NF-ATs) are a family of transcription factors that transduce calcium signals in the immune, cardiac, muscular, and nervous systems (20Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Like their distant relatives the Rel family, which includes NF-κB, NF-ATs are located in the cytoplasm of resting cells and are activated by their induced nuclear import (21Zhu J. McKeon F. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Calcium signaling activates calcineurin and induces the movement of NF-AT proteins into the nucleus, where they cooperate with other proteins to form complexes on DNA. Some NF-ATs are characterized by a highly conserved DNA-binding domain as well as a calcineurin-binding domain (22Luo C. Shaw K.T.Y. Raghavan A. Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F. Perrino B.A. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8907-8912Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The binding of calcineurin to the latter domain controls the nuclear transport of these NF-ATs (22Luo C. Shaw K.T.Y. Raghavan A. Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F. Perrino B.A. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8907-8912Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although many reports have suggested a physiological link between the NF-κB and NF-AT pathways, the functional linkage between these two signaling pathways has yet to be determined. In the study presented here, we investigated the cellular function of DSCR1 by searching for novel binding partner(s). We found that NIK selectively binds to and phosphorylates the C-terminal region of DSCR1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this phosphorylation of DSCR1 enhances its stability, which in turn leads to an increase in the levels of soluble and insoluble DSCR1. MaterialsThe following materials were used. Synthetic dropout medium (SD/T, SD/L, and SD/HLT) and yeast extract peptone dextrose medium containing adenine were purchased from MP Biomedicals (Solon, OH). The human fetal brain cDNA library was purchased from Clontech. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgGs were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. All cell culture reagents, including Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum, and TRIzol reagent were purchased from Invitrogen. Protein A-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Polyclonal and monoclonal anti-HA, anti-GFP, and anti-NIK antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-FLAG antibody and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. Clasto-lactacystin β-lactone and MG132 were purchased from Calbiochem. A mammalian expression vector for HA-tagged human wild type DSCR1 was kindly provided by S. de la Luna (Genomics Regulation Center, Barcelona, Spain), and plasmids encoding wild type and deletions of GFP-tagged DSCR1 and HA-tagged wild type calcineurin A were kindly provided by B. A. Rothermel (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas). GST-tagged bacterial expression vectors encoding amino acids 1–197 (full length), 1–90, and 90–197 of DSCR1 were constructed by subcloning PCR products from HA-tagged DSCR1 into pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mammalian expression vectors for Myc-tagged wild type NIK and its kinase-deficient mutants, such as Myc-NIK-KD (in which the catalytic domain of NIK from amino acids 100–250 is deleted) and Myc-NIK-KKAA (in which lysine residues at position 429 and 430 are mutated to alanine), were gifts from T. H. Lee (Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea). Rabbit polyclonal antibody of DSCR1 was produced commercially (Lab Frontier, Seoul, Korea) by injecting purified GST-DSCR1. The serum from these rabbits was then affinity-purified using standard methods. Yeast Two-hybrid AssayScreening was performed using a 13-week human fetal brain Matchmaker cDNA library subcloned into the activation domain of pACT2 vector, and yeast strain carrying the pHybTrp/Zeo-plasmid that encoded for wild type DSCR1 was used as bait. The yeast strain L40, which contains the reporter genes lacZ and HIS3 under the control of LexA promoter, was sequentially transformed with bait vector then the cDNA library vectors, and the cells were plated on a synthetic medium containing 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan. After 10–14 days at 30 °C, the transformants were grown on synthetic medium containing 50 μg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-d-galactoside, but lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan. After 2–3 days at 30 °C, the resulting yeast colonies displaying a blue color were selected as positive clones. The plasmids from these positive clones were extracted in lysis buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1.0 mm EDTA and then transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α by electroporation. The inserts of the plasmids from the positive library clones were analyzed using an automatic DNA sequencer (ALF Express, Amersham Biosciences). Cell CultureHuman embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and rat embryonic hippocampal (H19-7) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. These cells were transfected with the Lipofectamine plus reagent (Invitrogen) using the supplier's recommended instructions. To prepare lysates, the cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), solubilized in lysis buffer (Tris, pH 7.9, containing 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm NaF, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and then scraped. Supernatant was collected after centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad detergent-compatible protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot AnalysisOne microgram of antibody was incubated with 2 mg of cell extracts in lysis buffer overnight at 4 °C. Fifty microliters of a 1:1 suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The beads were pelleted and washed extensively with cell lysis buffer. Bound proteins were dissociated by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and whole protein samples were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Japan). The membranes were blocked in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 3% nonfat dried milk) for 3 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in 3% nonfat dried milk containing the appropriate antibodies. The membranes were washed several times in TBST and then incubated with IgG-coupled horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). After 60 min, the blots were washed several times with TBST, and resulting immunocomplexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse Transcription-PCRTotal cellular mRNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using random primers. Two micrograms of cDNA were used per PCR. The primers used were as follows: rat dscr1 forward, 5′-C CGGAATTCATGCATTTTAGGGACTTTA-3′, and rat dscr1 reverse, 5′-CCGCTCAAGGCTGAGGTGGATGGG-3′; human dscr1 forward, 5′-GAGGAGGTGGACCTGCAGGACCTG-3′, and human dscr1 reverse, 5′-TCAGCTGAGGTGGATCGGCGTGTAC-3′. Preparation of Nonidet P-40-soluble/insoluble FractionsCells were solubilized with 1.0% Nonidet P-40, and the resulting cellular suspension was fractionated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants (i.e. the Nonidet P-40-soluble fraction) were directly immunoprecipitated. The resulting pellet (i.e. the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction) was washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer and then solubilized in 4% SDS sample buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% mercaptoethanol) for 1 h at 60 °C. ImmunocytochemistryCells were seeded overnight at 70% confluence onto coverslips in 6-well dishes. The following day, the cells were transfected. Twenty four hours later, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed with neutrally buffered 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 1% PBS solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. The cells were then incubated for 24 h at 4 °C with the indicated primary antibody diluted in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were incubated with secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were then analyzed using either fluorescence (IX71, Olympus) or confocal microscopy (LSM 510 META, Carl Zeiss). Preparation of Cytosolic and Nuclear FractionsCells were washed with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl) supplemented with protease inhibitors (dithiothreitol, aprotinin, and leupeptin), and then incubated on ice for 30 min. The cells were then lysed using a disposable syringe, and the lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was used as the cytosolic fraction. The resulting pellet, which was used as the nuclear fraction, was washed with hypotonic buffer and lysed with 1.0% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Supernatants from each fraction were collected after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. In Vitro Kinase AssayConfluent cells were harvested using lysis buffer. The soluble lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. Following the addition of protein A-Sepharose beads, the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and then rinsed with lysis and kinase buffers. Immunocomplex kinase assays were performed by incubating the cell lysates with the substrate in the reaction buffer (0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 100 μm ATP, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 2 h at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated, and the mixtures were subject to SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated substrates were visualized by autoradiography. Assessment of Cell Survival (MTT Extraction Assay)3,(4,5-Dimethyldiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT, 62.5 μl of a 5 mg/ml stock solution) was added to the 250 μl of medium in each well of a 24-well plate. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, 250 μl of extraction buffer (20% SDS and 50% N,N-dimethylformamide, pH 7.4) was added. After an overnight incubation at 37 °C, the absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a VERSA MAX enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with an extraction buffer negative control. TUNEL AssayCells were seeded overnight at 70% confluence onto coverslips in 6-well dishes. The following day, the cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, incubated for 24 h, and then treated with zinc for 1 h. Cell apoptosis was analyzed using an in situ cell death detection kit (TMR red, Roche Applied Science) that is based on the terminal TUNEL technology. Identification of Novel DSCR1-interacting Proteins Using a Yeast Two-hybrid AssayTo identify novel DSCR1-interacting partners, a yeast two-hybrid assay was performed using a human fetal brain cDNA library with full-length DSCR1 as the bait. We found several previously identified DSCR1-interacting proteins, such as calcineurin A (8Fuentes J.J. Genesca L. Kingsbury T.J. Cunningham K.W. Perez-Riba M. Estivill X. de la Luna S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Raf-1 (23Cho Y.J. Abe M. Kim S.Y. Sato Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 439: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which indicates that the assay is a reliable method for identifying DSCR1-interacting proteins. In addition to the known DSCR1-interacting proteins, our assay identified NIK as a protein that interacts with DSCR1 (data not shown). Based on the known physiological substrate of NIK and the fact that DSCR1 function is regulated by its protein stability, which in turn is affected by its phosphorylation status, the functional connection between DSCR1 and NIK was further characterized. DSCR1 Interacts with NIK in Neuronal CellsUsing an immunoprecipitation binding assay, we examined the potential interaction of NIK and DSCR1 in mammalian neuronal cells. H19-7 cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged human wild type DSCR1 alone, or in the presence of Myc-tagged NIK. Extracts from the transfected cells were then subjected to immunoprecipitation using either anti-HA or anti-Myc antibodies and then immunoblot analysis using anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 1A). This analysis revealed that DSCR1 associated with NIK (Fig. 1A). The use of preimmune IgG and empty protein A beads as negative controls (Fig. 1A) demonstrates that transiently transfected DSCR1 selectively binds to NIK in H19-7 cells. Next we examined whether IKKα, the only known substrate of NIK, also associates with DSCR1. Cells were transfected with HA-tagged IKKα and/or GFP-tagged DSCR1 and then subjected to immunoprecipitation. The results demonstrate that IKKα does not interact with DSCR1 (Fig. 1B). HA-tagged calcineurin A was used as a positive control in the GFP-tagged DSCR1 binding assay in H19-7 cells to demonstrate the reliability of the co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 1C). To determine whether DSCR1 and NIK interact in the absence of exogenous DNA addition, we examined the specific binding of endogenous DSCR1 and NIK in primary neuronal cells and transformed H19-7 cell line using co-immunoprecipitation assays. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, we found that endogenous NIK binds to endogenous DSCR1 in both H19-7 cells and primary cortical neurons. Immunoprecipitation using nonspecific IgG was used as a negative control. This interaction was also observed in rat whole brain lysates (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the specific interaction between DSCR1 and NIK is not an artifact of DNA transfection and transformation but actually occurs in the mammalian central nervous system. Wild Type NIK Binds to the C-terminal Domain of DSCR1To determine the protein domain(s) responsible for the interaction between DSCR1 and NIK, we used several deletion constructs encoding DSCR1 fragments fused to GFP in similar co-immunoprecipitation assays. As shown in Fig. 3A, we found that NIK co-immunoprecipitated with the full-length DSCR1 protein as well as with the DSCR1 peptide fragments containing amino acids 30–197 and 90–197. Interestingly, NIK did not co-immunoprecipitate with a DSCR1 peptide fragment containing the N-terminal 90 amino acids (Fig. 3), suggesting that the DSCR1 domain critical for interacting with NIK is included within amino acid residues 90–197. Furthermore, when we examined whether wild type DSCR1 binds to the kinase-deficient NIK mutant, DSCR1 binds to wild type NIK but not to its kinase-dead mutant, such as NIK-KD or NIK-KK/AA (Fig. 3B). NIK Phosphorylates DSCR1 in H19-7 CellsNext, we examined whether DSCR1 is a substrate of NIK. We have previously shown that zinc induces the phosphorylation and activation of IKK in H19-7 cells (24Min Y.K. Park J.H. Chong S.A. Kim Y.S. Ahn Y.S. Seo J.T. Bae Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 71: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). NIK is known to function as an upstream activator of the NF-κB signaling pathway that ultimately results in the activation of IKKα (15Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first examined whether NIK is also phosphorylated and activated by zinc. H19-7 cells were either transfected with Myc-tagged NIK plasmid or mock-transfected and then stimulated with zinc plus the zinc ionophore, pyrithione. Lysates from the resulting transfected cells were subjected to immunoblotting using anti-phospho-NIK antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4A, treatment with zinc plus pyrithione induced the phosphorylation of endogenous NIK. Furthermore, the cells transfected with wild type NIK had much higher levels of phosphorylated NIK than the mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4A). To examine the effects of zinc treatment on NIK-associated DSCR1 phosphorylation, H19-7 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged NIK and then either untreated or treated with zinc plus pyrithione. Lysates from the resulting transfected cells were immunoprecipitated using anti-NIK antibodies, and these immunocomplexes were then used in in vitro kinase assays with recombinant GST-DSCR1 as the substrate. The results, shown in Fig. 4B, demonstrate that whereas DSCR1 was phosphorylated by anti-NIK immunocomplexes from untreated cells, the phosphorylation was significantly higher with anti-NIK immunocomplexes from cells treated with zinc plus pyrithione. Furthermore, this increase in DSCR1 phosphorylation was not observed in cells transfected with a kinase-inactive dominant-negative NIK mutant (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate that wild type NIK specifically phosphorylates DSCR1, and the phosphorylation of DSCR1 is significantly induced by zinc treatment. NIK Phosphorylates C-terminal Domain of DSCR1To determine which domain(s) of DSCR1 are specifically phosphorylated by NIK, three bacterially expressed DSCR1 fragments fused with GST were purified and used as a substrate of NIK in in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 5, full-length DSCR1 and DSCR1 peptide fragment containing amino acid residues 90–197 could be phosphorylated by NIK following zinc plus pyrithione treatment. However, DSCR1 peptide fragment containing amino acid residues 1–90 could not be phosphorylated by NIK (Fig. 5). These data suggest that NIK specifically phosphorylates DSCR1 on a domain within amino acid residues 90–197. The NIK-mediated Phosphorylation of DSCR1 Leads to an Increased Half-life and Reduced Proteasomal DegradationNext, we examined the physiological consequence(s) of NIK-mediated DSCR1 phosphorylation. First, we examined whether this phosphorylation affects the half-life of DSCR1. Cells were transfected with HA-tagged DSCR1 alone or together with either wild type NIK or kinase-deficient mutants. The transfected cells were then incubated with cycloheximide for the indicated times. The levels of DSCR1 in these cells were measured by Western blot analysis using an anti-HA antibody. The cells transfected with DSCR1 and wild type NIK had ∼2-fold more DSCR1 than the cells transfected with DSCR1 alone (Fig. 6, A and B). Interestingly, this increase in DSCR1 protein levels was not observed in the cells transfected with DSCR1 and the kinase-dead NIK mutants (Fig. 6, A and B). These data suggest that the half-life of DSCR1 is increased by its NIK-mediated phosphorylation. Next, we examined whether NIK alters the levels of 1% Nonidet P-40-soluble and -insoluble DSCR1. H19-7 cells were transfected with HA-tagged DSCR1 and/or Myc-tagged NIK. Lysates from the resulting transfected cells were blotted using anti-HA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 7, the levels of Nonidet P-40-soluble and -insoluble DSCR1 were increased in the cells co-transfected with wild type NIK. However, the levels of DSCR1 were not markedly changed in cells co-transfected with kinase-deficient NIK mutant, as compared with control cells transfected with DSCR1 alone (Fig. 7, top, left panel). These results indicate that the NIK-mediated phosphorylation of DSCR1 increases its stability in two different ways. We have previously shown that the endogenous levels of DSCR1 are modulated by protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in H19-7 cells (25Lee E.J. Lee J.Y. Seo S.R. Chung K.C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 35: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Based on the results described above, we examined whether NIK affects the proteasome-mediated degradation of DSCR1. We mock-transfected or transiently transfected cells with DSCR1 plus NIK and then treated the cells with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. Lysates from these cells were then immunoblotted using anti-HA antibodies. As expected, MG132 treatment resulted in an increase in the levels of soluble DSCR1 and no apparent reduction in the level of insoluble DSCR1 in the absence of NIK (Fig. 7, top right panel). This finding supports the hypothesis that DSCR1 is constitutively degraded by proteasome. The increase in soluble DSCR1 levels was not altered by the presence of NIK or its kinase activity. Interestingly, MG132 treatment of cells transfected with wild type NIK resulted in the accumulation of insoluble DSCR1 relative to the mock-transfected control cells (Fig. 7A, middle panel). This result indicates that, in addition to the inhibitory effect on the proteasomal targeting, NIK also affects the stability of DSCR1 by altering its solubility. Similar results were observed when another proteasomal inhibitor, clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, was used (Fig. 7B). Next we tested whether NIK also affects the half-life of DSCR1 in 1% Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction. As shown in Fig. 7C, the cells transfected with DSCR1 and wild type NIK had also greatly increased the stability of DSCR1 in Nonidet P-40-insoluble pellet fraction than the cells trans"
https://openalex.org/W2084500594,"Tonicity-responsive enhancer/osmotic response element-binding protein (TonEBP/OREBP) is a Rel protein that activates transcription of osmoprotective genes at high extracellular NaCl. Other Rel proteins NFAT1–4 and NF-κB complex with activator protein-1 (AP-1) to transactivate target genes through interaction at composite NFAT/NF-κB·AP-1 sites. TonEBP/OREBP target genes commonly have one or more conserved AP-1 binding sites near TonEBP/OREBP cognate elements (OREs). Also, TonEBP/OREBP and the AP-1 proteins c-Fos and c-Jun are all activated by high NaCl. We now find, using an ORE·AP-1 reporter from the target aldose reductase gene or the same reporter with a mutated AP-1 site, that upon stimulation by high extracellular NaCl, 1) the presence of a wild type, but not a mutated, AP-1 site contributes to TonEBP/OREBP-dependent transcription and 2) AP-1 dominant negative constructs inhibit TonEBP/OREBP-dependent transcription provided the AP-1 site is not mutated. Using supershifts and an ORE·AP-1 probe, we find c-Fos and c-Jun present in combination with TonEBP/OREBP. Also, c-Fos and c-Jun coimmunoprecipitate with TonEBP/OREBP, indicating physical association. Small interfering RNA knockdown of either c-Fos or c-Jun inhibits high NaCl-induced increase of mRNA abundance of the TonEBP/OREBP target genes AR and BGT1. Furthermore, a dominant negative AP-1 also reduces high NaCl-induced increase of TonEBP/OREBP transactivating activity. Inhibition of p38, which is known to stimulate TonEBP/OREBP transcriptional activity, reduces high NaCl-dependent transcription of an ORE·AP-1 reporter only if the AP-1 site is intact. Thus, AP-1 is part of the TonEBP/OREBP enhanceosome, and its role in high NaCl-induced activation of TonEBP/OREBP may require p38 activity.

Among Rel-proteins, TonEBP/OREBP activates target genes that are osmoprotective at elevated extracellular NaCl. Transcriptional targets of TonEBP/OREBP include aldose reductase (AR), 2The abbreviations used are: AP-1activator protein-1ARaldose reductaseARRE-2antigen receptor-response element-2BGT1betaine/γ-aminobutyric acid transporterDBDDNA binding domainOREosmotic response elementOREBPORE-binding proteinSMITsodium-myo-inositol co-transporterTauTtaurine transporterTonEBPtonicity-responsive enhancer (TonE)-binding proteinAQP2aquaporin 2ATFactivating transcription factorHSP70heat shock protein 70siRNAsmall interfering RNANFATnuclear factor of activated T cell. the betaine/γ-aminobutyric acid transporter (BGT1), the sodium-myo-inositol co-transporter (SMIT), the taurine transporter (TauT), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and aquaporin 2 (AQP2). AR converts glucose to the osmoprotectant sorbitol, whereas BGT1, SMIT, and TauT transport the organic osmolytes betaine, inositol, and taurine, respectively, into cells (1Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kultz D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59 (437–455): 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). HSP70, a protein chaperone, also serves a protective function at elevated NaCl (2Rauchman M.I. Pullman J. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F9-P17PubMed Google Scholar). AQP2 increases water permeability of the renal collecting duct during adaptation to dehydration (3Nielsen S. Frokiaer J. Marples D. Kwon T.H. Agre P. Knepper M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 205-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). TonEBP/OREBP target genes often have multiple TonEBP/OREBP cognate DNA elements known as osmotic response elements (OREs) or tonicity enhancer-responsive elements (TonEs) (Tables 1 and 2). Additionally, all of the above noted genes except TauT have one or more activator protein-1 (AP-1) sites within 35 bp of an ORE (Tables 1 and 2). In the SMIT gene, an AP-1 site overlaps an ORE in the antisense direction (Table 1). In the AR gene, which has been mapped in multiple species, the AP-1 site is highly conserved across all species (Table 2).TABLE 1ORE and associated AP-1 sites and their relative positions in BGT1, SMIT, and HSP70 genesORE sequencePositionAP-1 sequencePosition BGT1-canineTonE2AGGAAAATCCC-144, -134TonE1TGGAAAAGTCC-62, -52TGATTCA-45, -39 SMIT-humanTonEATGGAAAACTAC∼-55 kbTGAGTAG10 bp 5′TonEB2TGGAAAATTCC∼-55 kbTGAGTCA34 bp 3′TonEC1TGGAAAATTAC∼-15 kbTonEC2TGGAAAGTTAC∼-15 kbTGAGTAAoverlap 4-bp antisenseTonEPTGGAAAGTTCC-331, -321 HSP70-mouseTonEATGGAAAGTTTT-1070, -1060TGAGGCA-1034, -1028TonEBTGGAAAATTTT-2326, -2316TGACTCA-2281, -2275TonECTGGAAATCTCC-3698, -3688TonEDTGGAAAAACAC-3715, -3705 AQP2-mouseTonETGGAAATTTGT-489, -479TGATTAA-528, -522 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Relative positions of OREs and associated AP-1 sites in AR genes across multiple speciesORE sequencePositionAP-1 sequencePosition AR-humanORE-ATGGAAAAATAT-1230, -1220ORE-BTGGAAAATTTA-1198, -1188ORE-CTGGAAAATCAC-1157, -1147TGAGTCA-1117, -1111 AR-rabbitORE-ACGGAAAAATAT-1181, -1171ORE-BTGGAAAAATTT-1148, -1138ORECGGAAAATCAC-1105, -1095TGAGTCA-1072, -1066 AR-mouseORE-ATGGAAAATATC-1128, -1118ORE-BGGGAAAATTTA-1108, -1098ORE-CTGGAAAATCAC-1053, -1043TGACTCA-1012, -1006 AR-ratORE-ATGGAAAATATC-1146, -1136ORE-BGGGAAAATTTA-1106, -1116ORE-CTGGAAAATCAC-1071, -1061TGACTCA-1031, -1025 Open table in a new tab activator protein-1 aldose reductase antigen receptor-response element-2 betaine/γ-aminobutyric acid transporter DNA binding domain osmotic response element ORE-binding protein sodium-myo-inositol co-transporter taurine transporter tonicity-responsive enhancer (TonE)-binding protein aquaporin 2 activating transcription factor heat shock protein 70 small interfering RNA nuclear factor of activated T cell. TonEBP/OREBP, also known as NFAT5, has characteristics intermediate between NFAT1–4 and NF-κB (4Lopez-Rodriguez C. Aramburu J. Jin L. Rakeman A.S. Michino M. Rao A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 47-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 5Stroud J.C. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Rao A. Chen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Like other Rel proteins, the DNA binding domain (DBD) of TonEBP/OREBP is in an N-terminal rel-homology region. The TonEBP/OREBP DBD is highly similar to the DBD in NFAT1–4 (up to 43% sequence identity), which was the basis for the cloning of this protein by one group of investigators (6Lopez-Rodriguez C. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Although the TonEBP/OREBP rel-homology region is similar to those of NFAT1–4, it binds DNA as a dimer, similar to NF-κB, whereas NFAT1–4 bind as monomers (5Stroud J.C. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Rao A. Chen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Both NFAT1–4 and NF-κB interact with AP-1 transcription factors in the transactivation of downstream genes. The AP-1 factors c-Jun and c-Fos interact with NFAT1–4 proteins at multiple rel-homology region residues resulting in strong stabilization of the ternary complex on DNA (7Macian F. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Rao A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2476-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). In the transactivation of many genes, the activity of the NFAT1–4 transcription factors depends on physical cooperativity with active AP-1 factors at composite NFAT:AP-1 sites found in promoter and regulatory regions. NF-κB also interacts with AP-1 in activation of target genes. This interaction may involve functional synergy (8Thomas R.S. Tymms M.J. McKinlay L.H. Shannon M.F. Seth A. Kola I. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) as well as physical cooperativity with AP-1 proteins (9Xiao W. Hodge D.R. Wang L. Yang X. Zhang X. Farrar W.L. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). ARRE-2 is an NFAT binding site in the interleukin-2 promoter (6Lopez-Rodriguez C. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 7Macian F. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Rao A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2476-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). TonEBP/OREBP binds to it in vitro, as does NFAT1 (6Lopez-Rodriguez C. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, unlike NFAT1, TonEBP/OREBP does not activate a luciferase reporter gene driven by three copies of ARRE-2 (6Lopez-Rodriguez C. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Although c-Fos and c-Jun cooperate with NFAT1 in binding to the ARRE-2 site in vitro, they do not cooperate with TonEBP/OREBP (amino acids 252–548) in its binding, which led to the conclusion that TonEBP/OREBP does not interact with AP-1 (6Lopez-Rodriguez C. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In another study the high NaCl-induced increment of activity of a luciferase reporter containing a reconstructed ORE region that lacks the AP-1 site is not significantly different from one that contains it since the decrease in activation occurred at both normo- and hypertonicity. This led to the conclusion that the AP-1 site does not play an important role in the osmoregulation of AR gene transcription (10Ko B.C.B. Ruepp B. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Chung S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16431-16437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, not only TonEBP/OREBP, but also the AP-1 proteins c-Fos and c-Jun are activated by high NaCl (11Cohen D.M. Wasserman J.C. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C594-C601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ying Z. Reisman D. Buggy J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 39: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Wiese S. Schliess F. Haussinger D. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Additionally, as noted, although a lack of the AP-1 site does not significantly affect the relative increase in ORE reporter activity induced by high NaCl, the lack does reduce the absolute activity by 37% when the level of extracellular salt is high and by 23% when it is not (10Ko B.C.B.

Noting that neither of these negative studies (6Lopez-Rodriguez C. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Using the ORE·AP-1 DNA sequence from the AR gene, we now find that mutating the AP-1 DNA site reduces TonEBP/OREBP-dependent reporter activity at elevated extracellular NaCl. Also, when NaCl is high, dominant negative AP-1 constructs reduce transcriptional and transactivating activity of TonEBP/OREBP, and siRNA knockdown of c-Fos or c-Jun reduces the mRNA abundance of its target genes, AR and BGT1. Furthermore, inhibition of p38, which is known to stimulate TonEBP/OREBP transcriptional activity (14Ko B.C. Lam A.K. Kapus A. Fan L. Chung S.K. Chung S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46085-46092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), reduces high NaCl-dependent transcription of an ORE·AP-1 reporter only if the AP-1 site is intact. We conclude that TonEBP/OREBP requires AP-1 for its full high NaCl-dependent increase in transactivation, and its role in high NaCl-induced activation of TonEBP/OREBP may require p38 activity. Cell Culture and Treatment—PAP-HT25 cells (passages 60–78) were cultured in 300 mosmol/kg medium as previously described (15Uchida S. Green N. Coon H. Triche T. Mims S. Burg M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: C230-C242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HEK293 cells (passages 38–48) were cultured in 300 mosmol/kg medium according to ATCC instructions. At experiment-specific time points, medium was replaced with medium that was 300, 200 (NaCl added to NaCl-free medium, Biofluids, Rockville, MD), or 500 mosmol/kg (NaCl added). For inhibitor experiments cells were pretreated with Me2SO or the p38 inhibitor, SB203508 (10 μm) in 300 mosmol/kg medium. After 1 h, fresh 300 or 500 mosmol/kg (NaCl added) medium containing either Me2SO or SB203508 was substituted. Me2SO was 0.01% in all inhibitor experiments. Plasmids and siRNAs—The ORE reporter construct contains bp –3497 to +27 of the rabbit aldose reductase gene upstream of the Photinus pyralis luciferase gene (described previously as ARLuc9) (16Ferraris J.D.

The sequence –3497 to +27 includes the aldose reductase promoter, three OREs (–1105, –1095; –1181, –1171; –1148, –1138), and an AP-1 site (–1072, –1066) in native gene context (GenBank™ U12317). The promoter reporter construct is the same but includes only bp –209 to +27. The mutant AP-1 construct reporter is the same as the ORE reporter with bp –1070 to –1068 changed from AGT to CTG. The mutation was made using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the construct was sequence-verified. The ORE-X luciferase reporter construct contains two copies of human ORE-X (17Ferraris J.D. Williams C.K. Ohtaka A. Garcia-Perez A. Am. J.

In brief, plasmid pFR-Luc (Stratagene) contains the yeast GAL4 binding site (upstream activating sequence) upstream of a minimal promoter and the P. pyralis luciferase gene. Expression plasmid pFA-CMV (Stratagene) contains sequence coding for the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain. A fusion protein was generated by in-frame insertion of the sequence coding for amino acids 548–1531 of clone KIAA0827 into pFA-CMV to generate GAL4dbd-548–1531. TonEBP/OREBP amino acids 548–1531 contain a NaCl-dependent transactivation domain (21Ferraris J.D. Williams C.K. Persaud P. Zhang Z. Chen Y. Burg M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Transfection and Luciferase Assays—PAP HT25 cells were grown in 300 mosmol/kg medium in 6-well plates and transfected with 0.5 μg of wild type ORE or mutant AP-1 reporter using CellPhect (GE Healthcare) according to supplier instructions. HEK293 cells were grown in 300 mosmol/kg medium. Five million cells were transfected by electroporation (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer's instructions. For ORE-X reporter assays, cells were transfected with 5 μg of ORE-X reporter. For ORE reporter assays, cells were co-transfected with 5 μg of ORE or mutant AP-1 reporter and 4 μg of TAM-67, 10 μg of A-Fos, or empty vector. For the GAL4 binary assay, cells were co-transfected with 5 μg of the GAL4 upstream activating sequence reporter, 0.5 μg of GAL4dbd or GAL4dbd-548–1531, and 10 μg of A-Fos or empty vector. Twenty-four hours after transfection at 300 mosmol/kg, fresh 200, 300, or 500 mosmol/kg medium was substituted. Luciferase activity was measured 16 h later with the Bright-Glo Luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Total protein was measured (BCA protein assay kit; Pierce). Luciferase activity was expressed in relative light units per μg of total cell protein. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—HEK293 cells stably expressing recombinant TonEBP/OREBP 1–1531V5-His were grown at 300 mosmol/kg. Fresh medium at 300 or 500 mosmol/kg (NaCl added) was substituted. Two hours later, nuclear pellets were prepared using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce) according to supplier instructions. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 with protease (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase (Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktails 1 and 2, Sigma) inhibitors (27Lee S.D.

Double-stranded ORE probe (bp –1238 to –1,104 of the human aldose reductase gene), containing three OREs and an AP-1 site in native gene context, was generated by annealing complementary 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies). The AP-1 mutant probe is the same as the wild type ORE probe with the 5′ to 3′ bp substitutions in the AP-1 site –1115 to –1113 from AGT to CTG. We combined 0.25–1 μg of nuclear extract with 0.5–1 μg of poly(dA-dT) in binding buffer (LightShift chemiluminescent electrophoretic mobility-shift assay kit, Pierce). Anti-TonEBP/OREBP (1 μg, NFAT5, Affinity Bioreagents, Neshanic Station, NJ), anti-c-Jun (4 μg), or anti-c-Fos (2 μg) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to some reactions and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. This was followed by the addition of 100 fmol of ORE or AP-1 mutant probe with or without 1000 fmol of nonbiotinylated ORE probe and incubation for 20 min. Total binding reaction volume was 20 μl. Reaction products were separated by gel electrophoresis in 0.4% SeaKem Gold-agarose in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer at 4 °C, transferred to nylon membranes, and UV cross-inked (Stratalinker, Stratagene). Biotinylated probes were detected using the LightShift chemiluminescent electrophoretic mobility-shift assay kit (Pierce) according to manufacturer instructions. Immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells stably expressing recombinant TonEBP/OREBP 1–1531-V5-His, 1–547-V5-His, GAL4dbd-548–1531, or GAL4dbd were grown in 300 mosmol/kg medium. Fresh medium at 200, 300, or 500 mosmol/kg was substituted. Two hours later cells were trypsinized and pelleted by centrifugation. Subsequent steps were at 4 °C. For whole cell extracts, the pellet from one 10-cm dish was extracted for 5 min with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science), and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktails 1 and 2; Sigma) and centrifuged (15,000 × g, 10 min). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared using NE-PER reagents (Pierce) according to supplier instructions. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were diluted with lysis buffer as above. For immunoprecipitation of 1–1531-V5-His or 1–547-V5-His and any associated proteins, samples were precleared with 1 mg of Dynabeads (Invitrogen) and 2 μg of rabbit IgG biotin-conjugated (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h and centrifuged. Precleared supernatants were incubated overnight with 4 μg of rabbit anti-V5 biotin-conjugated (Immunology Consultants Laboratory, Inc.) and 1 mg of Dynabeads (Invitrogen). For immunoprecipitation of GAL4dbd or GAL4dbd-548–1531 and any associated proteins, the samples were precleared with 1 mg of Dynabeads (Invitrogen) and 2 μg of mouse IgG biotin-conjugated (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h and centrifuged. Precleared supernatants were incubated overnight with 5 μg of mouse anti-Gal4dbd biotin-conjugated (Immunology Consultants Laboratory) and 1 mg of Dynabeads (Invitrogen).

Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), was included in some immunoprecipitations to test whether DNA is involved in the coimmunoprecipitation of associated proteins. For immunoprecipitation of c-Fos or c-Jun and any associated proteins, samples were precleared with 20 μl of protein A/G-Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 0.5μg of rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h and centrifuged. Precleared supernatants were mixed overnight with 2 μg of rabbit anti-c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 2 μg of rabbit anti-c-Fos (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 20 μl of protein A/G-Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). As negative controls, IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was substituted for anti-c-Fos or c-Jun. Beads were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and incubated for 5 min at 95 °C, and after centrifugation, supernatant proteins were separated on a Tris-HCl, 4–15% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then cut. One part of the membrane was incubated at 4 °C overnight with mouse anti-V5 (Invitrogen), anti-Gal4dbd (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-TonEBP/OREBP (NFAT5, Affinity Bioreagents); the others were incubated with rabbit anti-c-Fos or c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were visualized using a LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imager. siRNA Knockdown of c-Jun and c-Fos and Quantitative Real Time PCR—HEK293 cells were grown in 300 mosmol/kg medium and transfected with 20 nm control, c-Jun, or c-Fos siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 according to supplier instructions. After 48 h, fresh medium at 300 or 500 mosmol/kg (NaCl added) was substituted. Sixteen hours later, total RNA was isolated (RNeasy, Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and cDNA was prepared using a TaqMan reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to supplier instructions. PCR was performed on 8 and 80 ng of cDNA samples/20-μl reaction in triplicate for each experiment (Taqman PCR master mix, Applied Biosystems). Amplicons were detected with an ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Primers directed against the human sequence of aldose reductase (AR) were 5′-ATCGCAGCCAAGCACAATAA-3′ and 5′-AGCAATGCGTTCTGGTGTCA-3′. The 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled probe was 5′-CAGCCCAGGTCCTGATCCGGTTC-3′ (29Cai Q. Ferraris J.D. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: F58-F67Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The primers for human BGT1 were 5′-CCCGAGGAGGGAGAGAAGTT-3′ and 5′-TCCATCTTGTTGGTCCATTGG-3′. The 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled probe was 5′-AAAGACGAGGACCAGGTGAAGGATCGG-3′ (29Cai Q. Ferraris J.D. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol.

Primers directed against the human sequence of the cyclophilin gene were 5′-TGTGCCAGGGTGGTGACTT-3′ and 5-TCAAATTTCTCTCCGTAGATGGACTT-3′. The 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled probe was 5′-CCACCAGTGCCATTATGGCGTGT-3′. The detection system records the number of PCR cycles (Ct) required to produce an amount of product equal to a threshold value, which is a constant. From the Ct values we calculated the mRNA abundance in each experimental condition relative to that of control cells at 300 mosmol/kg, as described (21Ferraris J.D. Williams C.K. Persaud P. Zhang Z. Chen Y. Burg M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data were compared by repeated measures of analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison test for separation of significant means. Normalized data were log-transformed before analysis of variance. Differences were considered significant for p ≤ 0.05. The 5′-flanking region of the rabbit AR gene contains three OREs (16Ferraris J.D. Williams C.K. Martin B.M. Burg M.B. Garcia-Perez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We used an ORE luciferase reporter and the same reporter mutated at the AP-1 site to determine the relative contribution of this binding site to TonEBP/OREBP-mediated transcriptional activity in PAP-HT25 and HEK293 cells at 300 and at 500 mosmol/kg (NaCl added) (Fig. 1). When osmolality is raised from 300 to 500 mosmol/kg by adding NaCl, transcriptional activity of the ORE reporter increases significantly. Mutation of AP-1 reduces transcriptional activity by 46% in PAP-HT25 cells and 44% in HEK293 cells. Transcriptional activity at 300 mosmol/kg is unaffected by mutation at the AP-1 site. We conclude that at 500 mosmol/kg, AP-1 is a potentiating element. To determine whether the AP-1 transcription factors c-Fos and c-Jun associate with TonEBP/OREBP in the protein complex that binds to the wild type DNA probe containing three OREs and an AP-1 site, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay binding reactions using HEK293 nuclear protein extracts with and without added antibody to c-Fos or c-Jun. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from cells at 300 mosmol/kg required 4× more extract to generate a mobility shift than nuclear extracts from cells at 500 mosmol/kg because high NaCl causes TonEBP/OREBP to translocate to the nucleus, which results in more TonEBP/OREBP in the nucleus at 500 mosmol/kg (Fig. 2, A and B).

PAG has a role in negative regulation of Src family kinases in T-cells by recruitment of Csk (C-terminal Src kinase) to the membrane via binding to PAG phosphotyrosine 317. The interaction between FynT and PAG is essential for PAG function; however, so far the FynT binding mode has been unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the FynT-PAG complex formation is a dual domain docking process, involving SH2 domain binding to PAG phosphotyrosines as well as an SH3 domain interaction with the first proline-rich region of PAG. This binding mode affects FynT kinase activity, PAG phosphorylation, and recruitment of FynT and Csk, demonstrated in Jurkat TAg cells after antibody stimulation of the T cell receptor. Furthermore, we show that TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation is regulated by SH3 domain modulation of the FynT-PAG interaction in human primary T-cells. Although FynT SH3 domain association is shown to be crucial for efficiently initiating PAG phosphorylation, we suggest that engagement of the SH2 domain on PAG renders FynT insensitive to Csk negative regulation.

Protein-tyrosine kinases are key mediators of signaling through cell surface receptors, and specificity and regulation of their activities is critical for creating the correct responses to external stimuli. In T-cells, ligand engagement of the T-cell receptor leads to activation of proximal protein-tyrosine kinases of the Src kinase family (Lck and FynT), which subsequently induce tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in the T-cell receptor (TCR) 2The abbreviations used are: TCRT-cell receptorGSTglutathione S-transferaseSFKSrc family kinaseSH2Src homology 2SH3Src homology 3WTwild type. complex (1Palacios E.H.

Protein-tyrosine kinases of the Src kinase family have a conserved modular architecture fundamental to their highly specific function, interactions, and regulation (3Boggon T.J. Eck M.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7918-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The archetypal Src family kinase (SFK) consists of an N-terminal membrane-targeting region (myristoylated and/or palmitoylated) (4Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), followed by successive SH3 and SH2 domains, capable of binding to proline-rich and phosphotyrosine-containing motifs, respectively, as well as a catalytic domain. In addition, SFKs contain a regulatory tyrosine residue within the kinase domain and an autoinhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation site in the C-terminal tail (5Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 6Arold S.T. Ulmer T.S. Mulhern T.D. Werner J.M. Ladbury J.E. Campbell I.D. Noble M.E. J. Biol.

Regulation of SFKs is mediated by the cytoplasmic kinase Csk (C-terminal Src kinase), which phosphorylates the C-terminal tyrosine of SFKs to initiate the formation of an inactive, closed configuration through intramolecular engagement of the SH2 domain. Phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (hereafter referred to as PAG) (8Kawabuchi M. Satomi Y. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nada S. Nagai K. Tarakhovsky A. Okada M.

Kuramitsu Y. Kornacker B. Horejsi V. Schraven B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), is a transmembrane adaptor protein involved in the negative regulatory mechanism of SFKs by anchoring of Csk to lipid rafts through specific binding of the SH2 domain to PAG-phosphorylated tyrosine 317 (human cells; Tyr314 in mice). The interaction increases Csk activity (10Takeuchi S. Takayama Y. Ogawa A. Tamura K. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29183-29186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), which subsequently acts by phosphorylating the regulatory C-terminal tyrosine of SFKs. PAG, also known as Cbp (Csk-binding protein), is localized to lipid rafts by palmitoylation and consists of a large cytoplasmic domain containing two proline-rich regions as well as 10 tyrosine residues, nine of which are potential candidates for phosphorylation by SFKs. In resting T-cells, PAG is constitutively phosphorylated; however, stimulation of the TCR induces a rapid dephosphorylation of PAG, leading to a transient displacement of Csk from lipid rafts (9Brdicka T. Pavlistova D. Leo A. Bruyns E. Korinek V. Angelisova P. Scherer J. Shevchenko A. Hilgert I. Cerny J. Drbal K. Kuramitsu Y. Kornacker B. Horejsi V. Schraven B. J. Exp.

The dissociation allows the signaling mediators Lck and FynT to become activated, thus initiating a TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation cascade leading to T-cell activation (12Schmedt C. Saijo K. Niidome T. Kuhn R. Aizawa S. Tarakhovsky A. Nature. 1998; 394: 901-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Termination of this activating signaling event occurs by rephosphorylation of PAG at tyrosine 317 and recruitment of Csk back to lipid rafts. An additional role in negative regulation has been suggested for PAG through its association with EBP50, which may mediate a connection between lipid rafts and the actin cytoskeleton (13Brdickova N.

Little structural information is available for the interaction, although it has been suggested that the association is mediated by direct binding of the FynT SH2 domain to phosphorylated tyrosines in PAG (9Brdicka T. Pavlistova D. Leo A. Bruyns E. Korinek V. Angelisova P. Scherer J. Shevchenko A. Hilgert I. Cerny J. Drbal K. Kuramitsu Y. Kornacker B. Horejsi V. Schraven B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Interaction via the FynT SH3 domain has also been discussed, since mutations of PAG tyrosines have been shown not to abolish FynT association completely (18Davidson D. Schraven B. Veillette A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 1960-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phosphorylation of PAG in mast cells is dependent on the association with the SFK Lyn (19Ohtake H.

In this paper, we attempt a dissection of the FynT-PAG interaction at a higher resolution using peptide array technology in combination with mutational analyses. Our results identify the complex formation as a dual domain binding process, involving both binding of the FynT SH3 domain to the first proline-rich motif in PAG and a FynT SH2-mediated interaction with PAG phosphorylated tyrosines. Complexed to PAG, we postulate that the activated FynT kinase is still accessible for Csk C-terminal phosphorylation; however, inhibition of FynT activity is not effectuated until phosphorylated FynT dissociates from PAG. Thus, binding to PAG is important for positive as well as negative regulation of FynT activity. Our results are verified in a physiological setting by temporal analyses performed in Jurkat TAg cells, showing FynT and Csk interactions with PAG and the impact of TCR stimulation on these interactions as well as on PAG phosphorylation. In human primary T-cells, modulation of the FynT-PAG interaction is shown to regulate TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Reagents—Antibodies against FynT, Csk, phospholipase Cγ, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-CD3ϵ (OKT3) monoclonal antibody was affinity-purified by Diatec (Oslo, Norway) from supernatants of a hybridoma cell line purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA), whereas the F(ab′)2 fragment was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Europe Ltd. (Newmarket, UK). Antibodies against tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (4G10 and 4G10-horseradish peroxidase) and the full-length, active Fyn kinase were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Charlottesville, VA). The FLAG tag antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA), and the GST-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was from GE Healthcare (UK). Glutathione and FLAG beads were from Sigma. The phosphotyrosine-specific antibody against Zap-70 (pY319) was from Cell Signaling Technology Inc., whereas LAT (pY191) was from BioSource (Invitrogen). DNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—The gene encoding FynT was subcloned from a T-cell cDNA library into BamHI/NotI sites of the expression vector pcDNA3. FynT W119A and FynT R176K, mutants incapable of binding via SH3 and SH2 domains, respectively (23Hirai H. Varmus H.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Okamura H.

The FLAG-PAG construct encoding full-length PAG and a C-terminal FLAG tag was described previously (9Brdicka T. Pavlistova D. Leo A. Bruyns E. Korinek V. Angelisova P. Scherer J. Shevchenko A. Hilgert I. Cerny J. Drbal K. Kuramitsu Y. Kornacker B. Horejsi V. Schraven B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The various PAG mutants carrying tyrosine to phenylalanine exchanges or alanine substitutions in the first proline-rich region (residues 131–138) were generated as described above. The gene encoding GST-FynT full-length protein was made by subcloning the gene into BamHI/SalI sites of the pGEX-5X-1 vector. To make GST-FynT SH3, a stop codon was inserted at amino acid residue 145 of the full-length construct. GST-PAGΔTM was constructed by subcloning PAG amino acids 53–432 into BamHI/NotI sites of the pGEX-4T-2 vector. All constructs and mutagenesis were confirmed by DNA sequencing prior to use. Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain Rosetta by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and purified using GST beads as described previously (11Torgersen K.M. Vang T. Abrahamsen H. Yaqub S. Horejsi V. Schraven B. Rolstad B. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29313-29318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cells and Transfections—Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293T) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, nonessential amino acids and sodium pyruvate, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Transfections were carried out using FuGENE® 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Jurkat TAg cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and nonessential amino acids and sodium pyruvate. Transfections were carried out by electroporation as described (11Torgersen K.M. Vang T. Abrahamsen H. Yaqub S. Horejsi V. Schraven B. Rolstad B. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29313-29318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and the electroporate was expanded in complete medium and incubated for 18 h before harvesting. Human CD3+ T cells were purified from normal blood donors by negative selection as described previously (11Torgersen K.M. Vang T. Abrahamsen H. Yaqub S. Horejsi V. Schraven B. Rolstad B. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29313-29318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed using the Amaxa Nuclefector™ kit (Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated in complete medium for 18 h before harvesting and stimulation. Cell Stimulation, Lysis, and Immunoprecipitations—Prior to all stimulations, cells were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Jurkat TAg cells (1.5 × 108 cells/ml) were stimulated with anti-CD3ϵ antibodies (OKT3 at 1 μg/ml) for the indicated time at 37 °C. Human primary T cells (1.0 × 108 cells/ml) were stimulated by anti-CD3 (OKT3 at 0.3 μg/ml) followed by the addition of F(ab′)2 fragment (10 μg/ml) after 2 min for cross-ligation. Stimulation was continued for the indicated time before lysis as described above. Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPPi, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm n-β-octyl-d-glucoside, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). When specified, sodium pervanadate treatment was performed at 37 °C by adding a mixture of 0.01% H2O2 and 100 μm Na3VO4 for 4 min before cell lysis. For immunoprecipitation of FLAG-PAG, transfected cells were disrupted in the lysis buffer and incubated with anti-FLAG beads for 3 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were subsequently washed in lysis buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. SPOT Synthesis of Peptide Arrays and Array Interaction Detection—Peptide arrays were synthesized on nitrocellulose membranes using a MultiPep automated peptide synthesizer (INTAVIS Bioanalytical Instruments AG) as described (25Kramer A. Schneider-Mergener J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 25-39PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide interactions with GST and GST fusion proteins were determined by overlaying the cellulose membranes with 1 μg/ml protein. Bound proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-GST antibodies and visualized by ECL. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assay—Pulse-chase experiments were carried out as described (26Scott M.P. Miller W.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14531-14537Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, full-length, active Fyn (15 nm) and purified recombinant PAG (0.3 μm, if not stated otherwise) were incubated in the presence of 80 nm [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 10 min on ice. This was followed by a chase reaction containing 0.5 mm unlabeled ATP at 30 °C, and aliquots were withdrawn at the specified times. Reactions were terminated by boiling in SDS sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated PAG was detected using a phospho-screen (PhosphorImager, Amersham Biosciences). Interaction of FynT with PAG in Mammalian Cells—Previous reports have demonstrated that FynT is critically important for PAG phosphorylation and Csk binding by analysis of T-cells from Fyn-/- mice (16Yasuda K. Nagafuku M. Shima T. Okada M. Yagi T. Yamada T. Minaki Y. Kato A. Tani-Ichi S. Hamaoka T. Kosugi A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2813-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Despite these observations, few attempts have been made to elucidate the molecular basis of the interaction between FynT and PAG. Involvement of either the FynT SH2 or SH3 domains has been considered, following studies using mutational analysis and immunoprecipitations of recombinant proteins (9Brdicka T. Pavlistova D. Leo A. Bruyns E. Korinek V. Angelisova P. Scherer J. Shevchenko A. Hilgert I. Cerny J. Drbal K. Kuramitsu Y. Kornacker B. Horejsi V. Schraven B. J. Exp.

Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 1960-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In order to ascertain involvement of individual FynT domains in the association with PAG, we created two mutants of FynT, W119A and R176K, to isolate contributions from SH2 and SH3 domain binding, respectively. Tryptophan 119 is a highly conserved amino acid in various Src SH3 domains, and alanine substitution of this residue is known to abolish SH3 domain function (23Hirai H. Varmus H.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The FynT R176K mutant contained a point mutation of a critical arginine residue in the SH2 domain, which has been shown to reduce phosphotyrosine binding of Src family kinases (24Okamura H.

Domain structure and positioning of the mutations are shown schematically in Fig. 1A. Using these constructs and WT FynT, we performed immunoprecipitations from HEK 293T cells stimulated with sodium pervanadate to increase levels of tyrosine phosphorylation, subsequently securing a potential SH2 domain interaction with more homogenously phosphorylated PAG species. In addition, cells left untreated with sodium pervanadate were included in experiments to assess levels of PAG phosphorylation in HEK 293T cells before and after transfection with WT FynT. Western blot analysis showed that PAG phosphorylation in these cells is restored after introduction of WT FynT, whereas pervanadate-treated cells have constitutively phosphorylated PAG molecules (Fig. 1B). We assume that hyperphosphorylation of PAG in cells without transfection of WT FynT is caused by endogenous Fyn, detected in the HEK 293T cells lysates at very low levels. Further analysis showed a strong interaction between WT FynT and FLAG-tagged PAG and reduced binding for both mutants FynT W119A and FynT R176K. Association via the SH2 domain only (FynT W119A) appeared markedly stronger than the interaction mediated by the SH3 domain (FynT R176K). The observation conforms to the general binding pattern for these domains, and SH2 domains are known to interact with submicromolar affinities with sequences containing phosphotyrosines (27Ladbury J.E. Lemmon M.A. Zhou M. Green J. Botfield M.C. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3199-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), whereas SH3 domains bind with somewhat lower affinities to proline-rich ligands (28Pawson T. Gish G.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Binding to PAG was virtually abolished using a double mutant FynT (W119A/R176K) incapable of interacting via either domain and confirmed that the FynT-PAG interaction involved more than one domain. Identification of the FynT SH3 Binding Motif—The cytoplasmic tail of PAG contains two proline-rich sequences with the minimal SH3-binding motif PXXP, located at amino acid residues 134–137 and 257–260, respectively. In erythroid cells, phosphorylation of PAG is dependent on the kinase Lyn, and the second proline-rich region has already been identified as a binding site for Lyn in a yeast two-hybrid screen (22Ingley E. Schneider J.R. Payne C.J. McCarthy D.J. Harder K.W. Hibbs M.L. Klinken S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31920-31929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To locate the FynT SH3 domain-interacting site on PAG, we performed a peptide walk by synthesizing a SPOT peptide array on nitrocellulose membranes consisting of overlapping 20-mer peptides at 3-amino acid intervals. This array, which encompassed the full-length PAG sequence, was probed with purified recombinant FynT-SH3-GST fusion proteins. Binding was assessed immunologically with positive interactions identified as dark spots. Strong interactions were detected in five spots exclusively, which all spanned the first proline-rich region as marked in the PAG amino acid sequence (Fig. 2A). Probing the membrane with GST protein alone produced virtually no interaction (data not shown). The FynT SH3 interaction sequence was analyzed subsequently by N- and C-terminal deletions to reveal the boundaries of the interaction site (Fig. 2B). These truncations defined clearly residues Arg131 and Pro137 as the N- and C-terminal boundaries for binding, respectively. Furthermore, replacement walk by sequential substitution of alanine identified amino acids Arg131, Leu133, Pro134, and Pro137 as essential for interaction between PAG and the FynT SH3 domain (Fig. 2C). Thus, the core sequence of the detected binding site reads RXLPXXP, which is identical to the consensus motif for class I SH3 ligands (29Feng S. Kasahara C. Rickles R.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12408-12415Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The critical arginine residue (Arg131) defines the orientation of the FynT SH3 domain binding to PAG by forming a salt bridge with a conserved residue within the SH3 domain (30Weng Z. Rickles R.J. Feng S. Richard S. Shaw A.S. Schreiber S.L. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 5627-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Further characterization of the FynT SH3 domain interaction was performed using a two-dimensional peptide array, generated by systematically substituting the 14-mer peptide containing the interaction site by all natural amino acids (Fig. 3A). Again, this array identified the Arg, Leu, and Pro residues of the consensus sequence as essential for interaction with the FynT SH3 domain. Additionally, we identified residues outside this sequence, histidine 128, glutamine 129, and glutamate 139, which displayed some reduction in binding when substituted with certain amino acids. Flanking residues both N- and C-terminal to the core binding sequence have been shown to contribute toward SH3 domain binding and may serve as determinants of SH3 affinity and selectivity; however, these additional interactions have been shown to require an intact core motif (29Feng S. Kasahara C. Rickles R.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12408-12415Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 31Rickles R.J. Botfield M.C. Zhou X.M. Henry P.A. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Combining the interaction data created by the two-dimensional array, we were also capable of creating an optimal binding sequence for SH3 binding. All possible combinations of single substitutions giving stronger binding than the native sequence were generated, and their relative affinities for the FynT SH3 domain were tested (data not shown). The optimal binding sequence contained the core binding motif with two amino acid substitutions, E132P and P138R, marked by white circles in Fig. 3A, and was introduced into full-length PAG to produce a high affinity ligand for FynT. This construct, referred to as superPAG (Fig. 3B) was used in further experiments as a functional tool for the analysis of kinase activity and effects of FynT binding. SH3 Interaction Analysis in Vivo—Immunoprecipitations of full-length PAG containing single, double, and triple mutations at the critical positions defined by the two-dimensional peptide arrays were performed to confirm ablation of SH3 domain binding (data not shown). Experiments were carried out using the FynT mutant R176K, which displays greatly reduced association with phosphotyrosines. Surprisingly, we were not capable of abrogating binding via the SH3 domain completely, not even with a PAG construct containing a triple alanine substitution at residues Arg131, Leu133, and Pro134 (Fig. 3C). This construct, named RLP*, produced a ∼70% reduction in binding. It is likely that the residual binding is a result of incomplete removal of SH2 domain contribution through mutation of R176K or, alternatively, that amino acid residues outside the core SH3-binding motif are capable of stabilizing the interaction with PAG. Identification of alternative interaction modes was not pursued. Immunoprecipitations were also performed with the high affinity binder superPAG, which displayed a relative increase in FynT SH3 domain binding of ∼100%. Identification of the FynT SH2 Binding Motif—Peptide array synthesis of full-length PAG was repeated using phosphotyrosine at all tyrosine residues to assess interaction with FynT SH3-SH2-GST fusion proteins (Fig. 4A). Again, interaction with the first proline-rich region of PAG was detected; in addition, we found that the SH3-SH2 proteins were capable of associating with all peptide spots containing a phosphorylated tyrosine residue, barring Tyr(P)299. It has previously been observed that the Fyn SH2 domain binds promiscuously to many unrelated phosphotyrosine-containing peptides (32Zozulya S. Lioubin M. Hill R.J. Abram C. Gishizky M.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1193-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); thus, due to the low level of discrimination among phosphotyrosine-containing peptides on array membranes, this approach was not pursued further. To reveal the position of the PAG phosphotyrosine involved in FynT SH2 domain binding, we created PAG constructs containing phenylalanine substitutions at all tyrosine residues but one to isolate the contribution from single phosphotyrosine residues. A PAG construct having all tyrosine residues removed by phenylalanine substitution was also made (PAG 10YF). Immunoprecipitations from HEK 293T cells transiently co-transfected with FynT and the various full-length PAG mutants were performed to analyze the SH2 domain interaction in vivo (Fig. 4B). In addition, we performed repeat experiments using FynT W119A and cells stimulated with sodium pervanadate to increase tyrosine phosphorylation and maximize SH2 domain interaction. Note that residue Tyr299, which did not interact with FynT SH3-SH2 when included in the peptide array, was not a target for tyrosine kinases in these cells as mea"
https://openalex.org/W2152041017,"The P4 protein of bacteriophage phi12 is a hexameric molecular motor closely related to superfamily 4 helicases. P4 converts chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work, to translocate single-stranded RNA into a viral capsid. The molecular basis of mechanochemical coupling, i.e. how small approximately 1 A changes in the ATP-binding site are amplified into nanometer scale motion along the nucleic acid, is not understood at the atomic level. Here we study in atomic detail the mechanochemical coupling using structural and biochemical analyses of P4 mutants. We show that a conserved region, consisting of superfamily 4 helicase motifs H3 and H4 and loop L2, constitutes the moving lever of the motor. The lever tip encompasses an RNA-binding site that moves along the mechanical reaction coordinate. The lever is flanked by gamma-phosphate sensors (Asn-234 and Ser-252) that report the nucleotide state of neighboring subunits and control the lever position. Insertion of an arginine finger (Arg-279) into the neighboring catalytic site is concomitant with lever movement and commences ATP hydrolysis. This ensures cooperative sequential hydrolysis that is tightly coupled to mechanical motion. Given the structural conservation, the mutated residues may play similar roles in other hexameric helicases and related molecular motors."

We have recombinantly expressed the ectodomain of IGF-1R or fused this domain to the constant domain from the Fc fragment of mouse immunoglobulin. The ligand binding properties of these soluble IGF-1Rs for IGF-I and IGF-II were investigated using conventional ligand competition assays and BIAcore biosensor technology. In ligand competition assays, the soluble IGF-1Rs both bound IGF-I with similar affinities and a 5-fold lower affinity than that seen for the wild type receptor. In addition, both soluble receptors bound IGF-II with similar affinities to the wild type receptor. BIAcore analyses showed that both soluble IGF-1Rs exhibited similar ligand-specific association and dissociation rates for IGF-I and for IGF-II. The soluble IGF-1R proteins both exhibited negative cooperativity for IGF-I, IGF-II, and the 24-60 antibody, which binds to the IGF-1R cysteine-rich domain. We conclude that the addition of the self-associating Fc domain to the IGF-1R ectodomain does not affect ligand binding affinity, which is in contrast to the soluble ectodomain of the IR. This study highlights some significant differences in ligand binding modes between the IGF-1R and the insulin receptor, which may ultimately contribute to the different biological activities conferred by the two receptors.

Both IGF-I and IGF-II are essential for normal growth and development. Targeted gene disruption of IGF-I or IGF-II results in mice with reduced birth weight compared with their wild type littermates (1DeChiara T.M. Efstratiadis A. Robertson E.J.

Conversely, overexpression of the IGF-1R or IGFs in cancer tissues leads to the potentiation of cancer cell growth and survival (3Samani A.A. Yakar S. Leroith D. Brodt P. Endocr.

Despite their similarity in sequence and structure IGF-I and IGF-II can stimulate both overlapping and distinct biological functions (reviewed in Ref. 9Denley A. Cosgrove L.J. Booker G.W.

This is evident in patients with IGF-I deficiency, which results in severe growth and mental retardation, where IGF-II does not compensate for the loss of IGF-I activity (10Woods K.A.

Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to understand how both IGF-I and IGF-II stimulate their respective biological outcomes, we first need to understand the mechanism by which both ligands bind and in turn activate the IGF-1R. The IGF-1R is a member of the tyrosine kinase family of receptors and, together with the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-related receptor, forms a subfamily with similar structural organization (reviewed in Ref. 9Denley A. Cosgrove L.J. Booker G.W. Wallace J.C. Forbes B.E. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 421-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The IGF-1R and IR are homodimers composed of two α and two β subunits and are synthesized as a single precursor polypeptide, which is then post-translationally processed by dimerization, proteolytic cleavage, and glycosylation. The amino-terminal regions of the α chain of these receptors are composed of three domains, two structurally homologous subdomains designated large homologous domain 1 (L1) and large homologous domain 2 (L2), which are separated by a cysteine-rich (CR) domain of ∼160 amino acids (3Samani A.A. Yakar S. Leroith D. Brodt P. Endocr. Rev. 2007; 28: 20-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar) (see supplemental Fig. S1). The major ligand binding determinants of the structurally related IGF-1R and IR reside within the extracellular α subunits of the receptors (reviewed in Refs. 9Denley A. Cosgrove L.J. Booker G.W.

Studies performed with truncated IRs have demonstrated that dimerization of the β chains is essential for receptor activation and signaling (15Tollefsen S.E. Stoszek R.M. Thompson K.

Full-length disulfide-reduced half-receptors, dimeric receptors truncated at the transmembrane domain (ectodomain), and monomeric IR fragments all exhibit reduced affinity compared with the wild type receptor (17Boni-Schnetzler M.

High affinity binding is restored by the inclusion of IR dimerization domains (Fn1, Fn2 insert domain) in soluble IRs (19Brandt J. Andersen A.S. Kristensen C. J. Biol.

Insulin binds to the IR via residues within the L1 domain of the IR, and a similar binding site for IGF-I and IGF-II exists on the L1 domain of the IGF-1R.

Interestingly, a unique binding site for IGF-I exists within the CR domain of the IGF-1R and provides the specificity for that ligand (37Gustafson T.A. Rutter W.J. J. Biol.

This arrangement is consistent with the evidence that ligand binding involves interaction with both receptor halves. Kinetic analysis of the ligand-receptor interaction with wild type IR and IGF-1R reveals high and low affinity ligand states that are involved in the characteristic negative cooperativity mode of binding (reviewed in Refs. 41De Meyts P. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S135-S148Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 42De Meyts P. Whittaker J. Nat. Rev.

The accelerated dissociation of bound ligand from the IR in the presence of unlabeled insulin suggests the presence of at least two interacting binding sites. In contrast, those soluble IR ectodomain fragments that have low affinity for ligand have a linear Scatchard plot and do not show negative cooperativity (41De Meyts P. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S135-S148Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 42De Meyts P. Whittaker J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 769-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Although the wild type full-length IGF-1R exhibits negative cooperativity for IGF-I (44De Meyts P. Wallach B. Christoffersen C.T. Urso B. Gronskov K. Latus L.J. Yakushiji F. Ilondo M.M. Shymko R.M.

In addition, truncation of the IGF-1R at the transmembrane domain is assumed to remove the characteristic feature of the wild type IGF-1R, negative cooperativity, but this has not been formally demonstrated. In the present study, we have assembled and expressed two soluble human IGF-1R variants, comprising the ectodomain of the IGF-1R and a soluble chimeric IGF-1R-Fc fusion protein of the IGF-1R ectodomain, fused to the Fc region of the heavy chain of mouse immunoglobulin (IgG1), designated sIGF-1R and sIGF-1R/Fc, respectively. These soluble IGF-1Rs exhibit high affinity IGF-I and IGF-II binding and negative cooperativity determined by immunocapture competition binding assays and BIAcore biosensor analysis. The sIGF-1R/Fc and sIGF-1R both exhibit high affinity IGF-I and IGF-II binding and negative cooperativity. We have also utilized a number of conformation-dependent anti-IGF-1R antibodies (45Soos M.A. Field C.E. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Zhang B. Roth R.A. Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Siddle K. J. Biol.

Construction of Soluble IGF-1 Receptor cDNA Plasmids—A schematic representation of the IGF-1R domain structure and the soluble receptors used in this study is provided in supplemental Fig. S1. Two soluble human IGF-1R variants were generated, comprising the ectodomain of the IGF-1R and a soluble chimeric IGF-1R-Fc fusion protein of the IGF-1R ectodomain fused to the Fc region of the heavy chain of mouse immunoglobulin (IgG1), designated sIGF-1R and sIGF-1R/Fc, respectively. The cloning strategy, the generation of stable cell lines expressing the soluble IGF-1 receptors, screening of transfected cell lines, metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation assays, purification of soluble IGF-1 receptors, and SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis are all described in the supplemental materials. Ligand Binding Analysis—Wells of microtiter plates (Immulon 4 HBX from Dynex Technologies) were coated with anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody 24-31 (10 μg/ml, 100 μl/well in phosphate-buffered saline) (45Soos M.A. Field C.E.

Hoyne, unpublished results. and blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (radioimmunoassay grade from Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at room temperature. Cell culture supernatant from soluble receptor-expressing cell lines or purified soluble receptor was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The wild-type IGF-1R was obtained from the p6 BALB/c3T3 cell line overexpressing the IGF-1R (46Pietrzkowski Z. Lammers R. Carpenter G. Soderquist A.M. Limardo M. Phillips P.D. Ullrich A. Baserga R. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 199-205PubMed Google Scholar), and cell membranes were solubilized as described by Denley et al. (47Denley A. Bonython E.R. Booker G.W. Cosgrove L.J. Forbes B.E.

Various concentrations of unlabeled receptor grade recombinant human IGF-I or human IGF-II (both prepared in house as previously described (48King R. Wells J.R. Krieg P. Snoswell M. Brazier J.

Receptor was diluted to bind 10–15% of added 125I-IGF-I or 125I-IGF-II tracer in the absence of unlabeled ligand. Plates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and bound counts were determined using a γ scintillation counter. The background binding was 5% of the total counts added, and this was subtracted to give specific counts bound. The binding data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 3.03 by curve-fitting with a one-site competition model. Receptor binding affinities were also determined using europium-labeled IGF-I (Eu-IGF-I) and IGF-II (Eu-IGF-II) in microtiter plate assays as described by Denley et al. (47Denley A. Bonython E.R. Booker G.W. Cosgrove L.J. Forbes B.E. Ward C.W. Wallace J.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2502-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Briefly, IGF-1R was immunocaptured with mAb 24-31 on white Greiner Lumitrac 600 plates and blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin/TBST (Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20), and then supernatant containing soluble receptor or solubilized p6 cell lysate was added. Bound europium-labeled IGF-I or IGF-II was then incubated on immobilized receptors together with unlabeled IGF-I or IGF-II or 100 nm mAb, as specified for individual experiments. Wells were washed three times in TBST and once in water. 100 μl/well enhancement solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added and then incubated for 10 min prior to determining the bound europium label by time-resolved fluorescence (47Denley A. Bonython E.R. Booker G.W. Cosgrove L.J. Forbes B.E. Ward C.W. Wallace J.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2502-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). BIAcore Determination of IGF-I and IGF-II Affinities for Soluble IGF-1R—sIGF-1R/Fc and sIGF-1R were coupled to the CM5 biosensor chip using a similar method to that previously described (50Forbes B.E. Hartfield P.J. McNeil K.A. Surinya K.H. Milner S.J. Cosgrove L.J. Wallace J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, CM5 sensor chips were activated with 35 μ l of N-ethyl-N′-[(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide at 5 μl/min. Receptor dialyzed against HBS running buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4) was coupled to the CM5 sensor chip by injecting 35 μl of receptor (4 μg) in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5. Uncoupled surfaces were then deactivated by 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. A blank flow cell was used as a reference on all chips. Binding analyses were performed at 25 °C using a BIAcore 2000 biosensor (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). A sensor surface coupled with 8,000–10,000 response units would routinely result in a response of ∼100 response units with 200 nm IGF-I. Kinetic analyses were performed using a range of IGF-I or IGF-II concentrations (100, 50, 25, 12.5, and 6.25 nm) at 30 μl/min. Surfaces were regenerated using 0.3 m sodium citrate, 0.4 m NaCl, pH 4.5. Data were analyzed using BIAevaluation 3.2 software using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. This model describes a simple reversible interaction between two molecules in a 1:1 complex. In each of at least two repeat experiments, samples were injected in duplicate, and the response on the reference flow cell was subtracted. Dissociation of Eu-IGF Ligands from IGF-1R—Following the binding of Eu-IGF-I or Eu-IGF-II ligand to immobilized receptors, plates were washed in TBST before the addition of 100 nm unlabeled IGF-I, IGF-II, or 24-60 mAb in 100 μ l of europium-binding buffer at room temperature. At various time points (0–2 h), wells were washed once in water, and then 100 μl/well enhancement solution was added and incubated for 10 min prior to determining the bound europium label by time-resolved fluorescence (47Denley A. Bonython E.R. Booker G.W. Cosgrove L.J. Forbes B.E. Ward C.W. Wallace J.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2502-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The dose-response experiments for examining the accelerating effect of unlabeled ligand or anti-IGF-1R mAb 24-60 were performed with an increasing concentration of IGF-I or IGF-II (0.01 nm to 5 μm) and 24-60 mAb (0.01 nm-5 μm), respectively. Synthesis, Expression, and Purification of Soluble IGF-1 Receptor Constructs—Two recombinant soluble IGF-I receptor (sIGF-1R) constructs were cloned into the pEEL5.HCMV-GS mammalian expression vector (51Cosgrove L. Lovrecz G.O. Verkuylen A. Cavaleri L. Black L.A. Bentley J.D. Howlett G.J. Gray P.P. Ward C.W. McKern N.M. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) driven by the human cytomegaloviral promoter. The first expression plasmid, designated pEEL-sIGF-1R, encoded the ectodomain of the human IGF-1R (sIGF-1R; 1–906 amino acids). In addition, a chimeric human IGF-1R-mouse Fc immunoglobulin fusion protein was encoded by the plasmid pEEL-sIGF-1R/Fc (for more detail, see the supplemental materials). Both of these cDNA expression constructs were transfected into hamster kidney fibroblast BHK-21 cells, and stable cell lines were generated. Cell lines expressing high levels of soluble IGF-1Rs (∼5 mg/liter) were identified by ELISA using conformation-dependent anti-IGF-1R antibodies (45Soos M.A. Field C.E. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Zhang B.

Receptor Binding Assays—We initially established that europium labeling of IGFs resulted in a tracer with identical characteristics in receptor binding assays as the traditional 125I-labeled IGFs. Competition binding assays using captured solubilized IGF-1R with Eu-IGF-I and 125I-IGF-I (Fig. 1A) resulted in binding curves that were superimposable. The same result was seen with Eu-IGF-II and 125I-IGF-II (data not shown). Therefore, europium-labeled tracers were used for all subsequent binding assays. Competition binding using solubilized wtIGF-1R, sIGF-1R/Fc, and sIGF-1R showed that both soluble ectodomain-containing fragments were identical in their binding affinities for IGF-I (Fig. 1B and Table 1). However, they showed a slightly lower binding affinity (IC50 = 0.4 nm) compared with the solubilized wild type IGF-1R (IC50 = 0.23 nm). A similar result was seen with Eu-IGF-II competition binding assays (Fig. 1C), where the ectodomain fragments bound IGF-II with a 1.8-fold lower affinity than solubilized IGF-1R. All receptors had a 2-fold lower affinity for IGF-II compared with IGF-I. BIAcore analyses confirmed the competition binding assays and showed that sIGF-1R/Fc and sIGF-1R have the same relative affinities for IGF-I or IGF-II (Fig. 1D and Table 2).TABLE 1Binding of europium- and 125I-labeled IGFs to wild type and soluble IGF-1RsIC50sIGF-1R/FcsIGF-1RwtIGF-1RnmEu-IGF-I0.42 ± 0.150.41 ± 0.10.25 ± 0.15Eu-IGF-II0.83 ± 0.30.88 ± 0.60.49 ± 0.07125I-IGF-I2.3 ± 2.22.0 ± 1.60.25 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2BIAcore analysis of IGFs binding to soluble IGF-1Rs coupled to the biosensor surfaceAnalyteSurfaceka × 105kd × 10-3KD × 10-9m-1 s-1s-1mIGF-IsIGF-1R/Fc4.72.55.3sIGF-1R2.92.79.3IGF-IIsIGF-1R/Fc5.65.710sIGF-1R4.28.219 Open table in a new tab Dissociation of Eu-IGF Ligands Bound to sIGF-1Rs—To investigate negative cooperativity of IGF-I and IGF-II binding to the soluble IGF-1Rs, we initially examined the dissociation of bound Eu-IGF-I in the presence or absence of unlabeled IGF-I (Fig. 2). In the absence of unlabeled ligand, the rate of dissociation of bound IGF-I from both soluble receptors (Fig. 2, B and C) was similar and slightly faster than from the solubilized wild type IGF-1R (Fig. 2A). However, the presence of excess unlabeled IGF-I accelerated the dissociation from the sIGF-1R, with ∼80% dissociation seen at 30 min compared with 55% from sIGF-1R/Fc and 50% from the wild type receptor (Fig. 2). Although negative cooperativity of IGF-I binding to the wild type IGF-1R has been previously demonstrated, the effect of IGF-II on negative cooperativity has not been reported. Therefore, we also examined the dissociation of bound Eu-IGF-II in the presence or absence of IGF-II from the wild type and soluble IGF-1Rs (Fig. 2). In buffer alone, dissociation of bound Eu-IGF-II from sIGF-1R/Fc and sIGF-1R (Fig. 2, E and F) was similar and slightly faster than that seen for the solubilized wtIGF-1R (Fig. 2D). The presence of unlabeled IGF-II accelerated the dissociation from the solubilized wtIGF-1R and both sIGF-1Rs (Fig. 2). The solubilized wtIGF-1R exhibited a slower dissociation rate in the presence of unlabeled IGF-II compared with sIGF-1R/Fc (∼30 and ∼50% dissociation at 30 min, respectively), whereas dissociation from sIGF-1R was faster (∼80% dissociation at 30 min Fig. 2). In addition, the dissociation of bound IGF-II with unlabeled ligand from sIGF-1R was similar to that observed with bound IGF-I with unlabeled ligand from the sIGF-1R (∼80% dissociation at 30 min). It was concluded that both of the soluble IGF-1Rs exhibit negative cooperativity of IGF-I and IGF-II binding. Soos and Siddle 4M. A. Soos and K. Siddle, unpublished data. have previously demonstrated that the anti-IGF-1R mAb 24-60 accelerates the dissociation of 125I-IGF-I from solubilized wtIGF-1R. This antibody binds to a similar epitope to that of αIR3 mAb on the IGF-1R (52Keyhanfar M. Booker G.W. Whittaker J. Wallace J.C. Forbes B.E. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 269-"

During Gram-negative bacterial infection, the Toll-like receptor 4 and MD-2 complex recognize lipopolysaccharide present in the bacterial cell wall. This recognition can be enhanced 100-1000-fold by CD14. However, the beneficial role provided by CD14 becomes detrimental in the context of sepsis and septic shock. An understanding of how CD14 functions will therefore benefit treatments targeted at both immune suppression and immune enhancement. In the present study, we use site-directed mutagenesis to address the role of disulfide bonds and N-linked glycosylation on CD14. A differential impact is observed for the five disulfide bonds on CD14 folding, with the first two (Cys6-Cys17 and Cys15-Cys32) being indispensable, the third and fourth (Cys168-Cys198 and Cys222-Cys253) being important, and the last (Cys287-Cys333) being dispensable. A functional role is observed for the first disulfide bond because the C6A substitution severely reduces the ability of CD14 to confer lipopolysaccharide responsiveness to U373 cells. Two of the four predicted glycosylation sites, asparagines 132 and 263, are actually involved in N-linked glycosylation, resulting in heterogeneity in CD14 molecular weight. Furthermore, glycosylation at Asn132 plays a role in CD14 trafficking and upstream and/or downstream ligand interactions. When mapped onto the crystal structure of mouse CD14, the first two disulfide bonds and Asn132 are in close proximity to the initial β strands of the leucine rich repeat domain.

This protective role of CD14, however, becomes devastating in the context of septic shock because it exaggerates an already overactive response. Corroborative evidence comes from the fact that CD14 knock-out mice are LPS-insensitive and resistant to septic shock (15Moore K.J. Andersson L.P. Ingalls R.R. Monks B.G. Li R.

The underlying mechanism by which CD14 facilitates LPS recognition remains obscure.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 3541-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It remains unknown whether a ternary complex is formed between LPS, CD14 and TLR4·MD-2, and if so, whether CD14 interacts directly with MD-2 or TLR4 in the transferring process. It is unlikely that CD14 would participate directly in the signaling cascade, because direct interactions can be observed between lipid A and TLR4·MD-2 complex (Kd ≈ 3 nm) (14Akashi S. Saitoh S.

When mapped onto the crystal structure of mouse CD14, residues 57-64 flank one side of the entrance of a hydrophobic pocket, whereas residues 39-44 reside at the bottom of the hydrophobic pocket (24Kim J.I.

Fukase K. Miyake K. Satow Y. Science. 2007; 316: 1632-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). CD14 is a glycoprotein with multiple LRRs. An interesting feature of LRR proteins is that cysteines are interspersed in the repeats forming disulfide bonds stabilizing adjacent repeats (26Bell J.K. Mullen G.E. Leifer C.A. Mazzoni A. Davies D.R. Segal D.M. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 528-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). All 10 cysteines of CD14 have been implicated in disulfide bonds (27Bazil V. Horejsi V. Baudys M. Kristofova H. Strominger J.L. Kostka W. Hilgert I. Eur. J. Immunol. 1986; 16: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The detailed pairing patterns are inferred from the crystal structure of mouse CD14 (24Kim J.I. Lee C.J. Jin M.S. Lee C.H. Paik S.G. Lee H. Lee J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11347-11351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Adjacent cysteines form pairs in the structure except for the first pair, where Cys6 pairs with Cys17 and Cys15 pairs with Cys32 (see Fig. 1a). The last disulfide bond of human CD14 (Cys287-Cys333) was not seen in the crystal structure of mouse CD14 because these two cysteines are absent from the mouse sequence. However, the structural and functional relevance of these disulfide bonds has not been addressed. It remains unknown whether these disulfide bonds are the prerequisite of CD14 folding or the result of physical proximity after CD14 folding. Four Asn residues have been predicted as the glycosylation sites (N-linked) for human CD14 (see Fig. 3a). However, only two of them (Asn132 and Asn261, which corresponds to Asn263 in human CD14) were seen in the crystal structure of mouse CD14 (24Kim J.I. Lee C.J. Jin M.S. Lee C.H. Paik S.G. Lee H. Lee J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11347-11351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Another Asn residue, Asn156, which is not conserved between the two species, was also glycosylated in the crystal structure of mouse CD14. Indeed, only these two sites were identified as N-linked glycosylation sites for soluble CD14 present in the plasma using a glycoproteomic approach (28Liu T. Qian W.J. Gritsenko M.A. Camp 2nd, D.G. Monroe M.E. Moore R.J. Smith R.D. J. Proteome Res. 2005; 4: 2070-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The biological importance of these two glycosylation sites, however, remains unknown. In the present study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to address these questions. Each Cys was individually replaced with Ala, and the four Asn residues were mutated to Ala individually or in combination. Our results here demonstrate that disulfide bonds and N-linked glycosylation, which are involved in orienting the initial β strand of the inner concave surface of the LRRs, are critical for the structure and function of CD14. Mutagenesis and Construction of Baculovirus StocksThe human CD14 genes that encode the signal peptide and mature CD14 with a C-terminal 8-amino acid deletion (construct 348) were produced by PCR (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Course. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using the following primers: the forward primer included a BamHI restriction site, the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, and the Kozak sequence, and the reverse primers included an EcoRI restriction site and codons for a six-histidine (H6) tag. The human CD14 CDNA gene engineered on PCDNA3 was used as the template (30Golenbock D.T. Liu Y. Millham F.H. Freeman M.W. Zoeller R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22055-22059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR products were introduced to the pEntr3C vector (Invitrogen) by restriction enzyme digestion (BamHI and EcoRI) and ligation and then transferred to pDest8 vector via site-specific LR recombination (Gateway® cloning technology; Invitrogen). The expression vector, pExp348H6, was created to encode precursor CD14 (lacking the last 8 amino acids) and a C-terminal six-histidine tag. The ten cysteines were individually mutated to alanine in pExp348H6 by QuikChange® mutagenesis (Stratagene) to produce single mutants C5A, C15A, C17A, C32A, C168A, C198A, C222A, C253A, C287A, and C333A. The four Asn residues, Asn18, Asn132, Asn263, and Asn304, were replaced with Ala individually and in combination to produce single, double, triple, and quadruple mutants. All of the mutations were confirmed by sequencing of the entire gene. Bacmids were obtained by transforming the pExp vectors into competent DH10Bac™ Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen) (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Siedman J.G. Smith S.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wilery & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). Positive clones were identified by a blue and white screen and were confirmed by PCR using M13 forward and reverse primers. Bacmids were then co-transfected with Cellfectin (Invitrogen) into SF9 cells to produce baculoviruses encoding the desired CD14 constructs. Positive clones were confirmed by Western blotting. The viruses were quantified by plaque assay as per the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen). Western BlottingSF9 cells were cultured in serum-free medium (SF900 II; Invitrogen) and infected by baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 2 during log phase. Three days post-infection, the medium was separated from the cells and clarified by low speed centrifugation (500 × g, 5 min). The cells were then lysed by lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, for analysis of total protein expression. The medium and lysed cell suspension were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immnobion-P) using a tank electroblot apparatus (Bio-Rad) for Western blot analysis. Penta-His antibody (mouse IgG1; Qiagen) was used to detect recombinant CD14. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Bio-Rad) were used as the secondary antibody. The blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase substrate (enhanced chemiluminescence substrates; GE Healthcare) and developed by exposure to film (Hyperfilm; GE Healthcare). Protein Expression and PurificationSuspension cultures were used for large scale production of recombinant proteins for selected mutants. Medium (1-2 liters) were collected 3 days post-infection and clarified by low speed centrifugation (500 × g, 5 min), high speed centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 min), and filtration. Secreted CD14 was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (75%, w/v), followed by resolubilization in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0. Concentrated CD14 was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) affinity chromatography using 150 mm imidazole to elute the protein. The proteins were further purified on a Hi-trap Q (GE Healthcare) anion exchange chromatography column using a linear gradient of NaCl (from 0 to 1 m in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 4 °C. The aggregation state was examined by size exclusion chromatography over a Superdex 200 column (1 × 30 cm; GE Healthcare) run in 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Protein signals were monitored by UV absorbance at 280 nm. Molecular weights were estimated from gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad) run under identical conditions. Fractions containing CD14 were concentrated by centrifugation on Amicon Centricon concentrators and buffer-exchanged to 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, for long term storage at -20 °C or -80 °C. The concentrations were determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient 31010 liters·m-1·cm-1 for all CD14 constructs (33Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). DeglycosylationPurified proteins (0.1 mg/ml, 100 μl) were denatured by heating in denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) for 10 min. G7 buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40) and 2500 units of peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF) (New England Biolabs) were added to the samples. The mixtures were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples before and after PNGaseF treatment were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue colloidal staining (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Course. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). CD SpectroscopyCD spectra were acquired on an AVIV 62DS spectrometer with a temperature-controlled cell. The samples were 0.1 mg/ml protein in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5. Far-UV CD spectra were collected at 1-nm intervals from 250 to 190 nm at 4 °C as the average of four scans with a 15-s integration time, in a 2-mm-path length cell. Thermal unfolding data were collected at 217 nm at 1-degree intervals from 20 to 100 °C with 60 s of signal averaging in a 2-mm-path length cell. Functional AssaysU373 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Cellgro) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cellgro) and 10 μg/ml ciprofloxacin. The next day, the supernatants were removed, and the cells were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline. Fresh RPMI 1640 medium without serum was then added to the culture. The cells were then stimulated with a fixed concentration of LPS (100 ng/ml, E. coli 0111:B4, Sigma, repurified by phenol chloroform extraction) and decreasing concentrations of CD14 (100-6.25 ng/ml). The cells were also stimulated with LPS alone (100 ng/ml) or CD14 alone (1 μg/ml) as controls. After 6 h of stimulation, the supernatants were removed and saved, and fresh serum-free medium was added to the culture. After overnight incubation, the supernatants were again collected, and IL-6 secretion in both sets of supernatants was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as per the manufacturer's instruction (R & D Systems). The results shown are the mean values of triplicate determinations ± S.D. from three independent experiments. The Differential Impact of Disulfide Bonds on CD14 FoldingThe effects of the 10 cysteine to alanine substitutions (Fig. 1a) were examined on protein secretion by Western blotting. Penta-His antibody that specifically recognizes the C-terminal six-histidine tag was used for detection. Only protein secretion is monitored because the template used to generate these mutants, construct 348, is devoid of the intact GPI linkage signal that normally tethers CD14 to the outer membrane (34Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Each mutation was tested in two independently constructed baculovirus vectors to ensure that the results are due to the expressed proteins and not a vector artifact. The amount of each construct secreted into the medium was compared with that retained within the cell. The C6A substitution (Fig. 1b, lanes 1 and 1′) has no effect on CD14 secretion compared with the wild type 348 construct. A significant portion of the total protein is secreted into the medium (m) while the cell (c) retains a larger portion of the overexpressed construct. Surprisingly, replacement of the disulfide bond partner of Cys6 in the C17A mutant (lanes 3 and 3′) abolishes CD14 secretion. Likewise, both the C15A (lanes 2 and 2′) and C32A (lanes 4 and 4′) substitutions result in complete abrogation of CD14 secretion. Because protein secretion is a good index for protein folding here, these results demonstrate that the first two disulfide bonds (Cys15-Cyys32) are essential for CD14 folding. The paradoxical effect of C6A substitution, however, indicates the existence of some salvaging process for this particular mutant. In comparison, the substitutions from Cys168, Cys198, Cys222, and Cys253 to Ala reduce, but do not completely block, CD14 secretion (Fig. 1b, lanes 5, 5′-8, and 8′). A significant amount of protein is still detected in the medium for these mutants, indicating that although disulfide bonds formed by these cysteines (Cys168-Cys198 and Cys222-Cys253) contribute to CD14 folding and secretion, they are not essential. Mutations at Cys287 and Cys333 have no effect on protein secretion (Fig. 1b, lanes 9, 9′, 10, and 10′), suggesting that the disulfide bond formed between these two cysteines (Cys282-Cys333) results primarily from physical proximity and is not essential for stability and secretion. N-Linked Glycosylation Accounts for the Observed HeterogeneityIn examining the gels of the Cys mutants (Fig. 1b), it is clear that the expressed proteins do not run as single bands. The apparent heterogeneity in size could arise either from proteolysis or from post-translational modifications such as glycosylation. Proteolysis at the C terminus is unlikely because the primary antibody used to detect CD14 in Western blotting recognizes the C-terminal six-His tag. N-terminal proteolysis is also unlikely because heterogeneity is still observed when another antibody, 3C10 that specifically recognizes amino acids 7-10 of CD14 (35Juan T.S. Hailman E. Kelley M.J. Wright S.D. Lichenstein H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17237-17242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), is used in Western blotting (data not shown). O-Linked glycosylation is unlikely because galactosamine, essential for O-linkage, is absent from the proteolytic fragments of purified native CD14 (27Bazil V. Horejsi V. Baudys M. Kristofova H. Strominger J.L. Kostka W. Hilgert I. Eur. J. Immunol. 1986; 16: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). N-Linked glycosylation was examined by treatment of 348 with PNGaseF, a glycosidase that hydrolyzes the bond between the innermost GlcNAc and Asn. As shown in lanes 7 and 11 of Fig. 2, deglycosylation by PNGaseF completely removes heterogeneity, confirming that wild type CD14 produced in insect cells is glycosylated, and differences in the extent of N-linked glycosylation account for the observed heterogeneity. The Differential Impact of N-Linked Glycosylation on CD14 SecretionThe four asparagine residues, predicted as the N-linked glycosylation sites for human CD14 (Fig. 3a), were mutated to alanines, individually and in combination, and the effects on protein secretion were examined by Western blotting using a penta-His antibody. The substitution of Asn18, Asn304, or both Asn18 and Asn304 with Ala has little effect on protein secretion (Fig. 3b, lanes 11, 11′, 14, 14′, 15, and 15′, respectively). Neither the secretion level nor the apparent heterogeneity of the secreted proteins is affected by the mutations, indicating that these two sites are not involved in N-linked glycosylation. In contrast, the substitution of either Asn132 (Fig. 3b, lanes 12 and 12′) or Asn263 (Fig. 3b, lanes 13 and 13′) with Ala reduces the apparent heterogeneity, confirming that these two sites are indeed involved in N-linked glycosylation in agreement with the crystal structure of mouse CD14. Furthermore, the substitution at Asn132 (Fig. 3b, lanes 12 and 12′) greatly reduces the secretion level, indicating that glycosylation at Asn132 serves as a secretion or sorting signal, not merely a “decoration.” In addition, the apparent migration on SDS-PAGE differs between the two mutants (Fig. 3b, compare lanes 12 and 12′ with lanes 13 and 13′). The migration of the N263A mutant is increased compared with the N132A mutant, indicating that glycosylation at Asn263 results in a longer sugar chain, whereas glycosylation at Asn132 results in a shorter sugar chain. The results are further confirmed by the double mutants that contain either the N132A or N263A mutations. Although no protein is detected in the medium of the double mutant N18A,N132A (Fig. 3b, lanes 16 and 16′), proteins are detected in the medium of the double mutant N18A,N263A (Fig. 3b, lanes 17 and 17′). Furthermore, the bands of the double mutant N18A,N263A are less smeared. Likewise, the secretion level of the double mutant N132A,N304A (Fig. 3b, lanes 19 and 19′) is lower than that of the double mutant N263A,N304A (Fig. 3b, lanes 20 and 20′). The difference in the apparent mobility between the N132A,N304A and N263A,N304A mutants (Fig. 3b, lanes 19 and 19′ versus lanes 20 and 20′) is also consistent with that between the two single mutants that contain either N132A or N263A mutation (Fig. 3b, lanes 12 and 12′ versus lanes 13 and 13′). That is, the apparent molecular weight of N132A,N304A mutant is greater than that of N263A,N304A, further confirming that sugar chains with different lengths are attached to these two sites. The impact on protein secretion is further confirmed by high order mutants. A low level of secretion is only detected for the triple mutant that does not contain the N132A mutation (Fig. 3b, lanes 22 and 22′), confirming that glycosylation at Asn132 serves as an important sorting signal for CD14 secretion. No secretion is detected for the double (Fig. 3b, lanes 18 and 18′), triple (lanes 21, 21′, 23, 23′, 24, and 24′) and quadruple mutants (lanes 25 and 25′) that contain both the N132A and the N263A mutations. In summary, our mutagenesis data on the four potential glycosylation sites confirm that Asn132 and Asn263 are involved in N-linked glycosylations of CD14, whereas Asn18 and Asn304 are not. Glycosylation at Asn263 results in a longer sugar chain, and glycosylation at Asn132 results in a shorter sugar chain. In addition, glycosylation at Asn132 serves as an important signal for CD14 secretion. Similar Migration Is Observed on SDS-PAGE for Purified Proteins of Selected MutantsThree interesting single mutants, N263A, N132A, and C6A, were expressed and purified from insect cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Consistent with the results from Western blotting, the migration of N132A and N263A on SDS-PAGE is increased, with (Fig. 2, lanes 7, 9, and 10) or without (Fig. 2, lanes 2, 4, and 5) any reducing reagent. However, both mutants still migrate as two distinct bands, and the difference in the molecular weight of those bands is smaller than differences seen with the wild type protein. This indicates that even at a single site, glycosylation is not ho"
https://openalex.org/W2051765792,"The mTORC1 complex (mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-raptor) is modulated by mitogen-activated protein (p44/42 MAP) kinases (p44/42) through phosphorylation and inactivation of the tuberous sclerosis complex. However, a role for mTORC1 signaling in modulating activation of p44/42 has not been reported. We show that in two cancer cell lines regulation of the p44/42 MAPKs is mTORC1-dependent. In Rh1 cells rapamycin inhibited insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-stimulated phosphorylation of Thr202 but not Tyr204 and suppressed activation of p44/42 kinase activity. Down-regulation of raptor, which inhibits mTORC1 signaling, had a similar effect to rapamycin in blocking IGF-I-stimulated Tyr204 phosphorylation. Rapamycin did not block maximal phosphorylation of Tyr204 but retarded the rate of dephosphorylation of Tyr204 following IGF-I stimulation. IGF-I stimulation of MEK1 phosphorylation (Ser217/221) was not inhibited by rapamycin. Higher concentrations of rapamycin (≥100 ng/ml) were required to inhibit epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced phosphorylation of p44/42 (Thr202). Rapamycin-induced inhibition of p44/42 (Thr202) phosphorylation by IGF-I was reversed by low concentrations of okadaic acid, suggesting involvement of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Both IGF-I and EGF caused dissociation of PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) from p42. Whereas low concentrations of rapamycin (1 ng/ml) inhibited dissociation of PP2Ac after IGF-I stimulation, it required higher concentrations (≥100 ng/ml) to block EGF-induced dissociation, consistent with the ability for rapamycin to attenuate growth factor-induced activation of p44/42. The effect of rapamycin on IGF-I or insulin activation of p44/42 was recapitulated by amino acid deprivation. Rapamycin effects altering the kinetics of p44/42 phosphorylation were completely abrogated in Rh1mTORrr cells that express a rapamycin-resistant mTOR, whereas the effects of amino acid deprivation were similar in Rh1 and Rh1mTORrr cells. These results indicate complex regulation of p44/42 by phosphatases downstream of mTORC1. This suggests a model in which mTORC1 modulates the phosphorylation of Thr202 on p44/42 MAPKs through direct or indirect regulation of PP2Ac."
https://openalex.org/W2049584440,"DNA topoisomerase I (Top1p) catalyzes the relaxation of supercoiled DNA via a concerted mechanism of DNA strand cleavage and religation. Top1p is the cellular target of the anti-cancer drug camptothecin (CPT), which reversibly stabilizes a covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate. Top1p clamps around duplex DNA, wherein the core and C-terminal domains are connected by extended alpha-helices (linker domain), which position the active site Tyr of the C-terminal domain within the catalytic pocket. The physical connection of the linker with the Top1p clamp as well as linker flexibility affect enzyme sensitivity to CPT. Crystallographic data reveal that a conserved Gly residue (located at the juncture between the linker and C-terminal domains) is at one end of a short alpha-helix, which extends to the active site Tyr covalently linked to the DNA. In the presence of drug, the linker is rigid and this alpha-helix extends to include Gly and the preceding Leu. We report that mutation of this conserved Gly in yeast Top1p alters enzyme sensitivity to CPT. Mutating Gly to Asp, Glu, Asn, Gln, Leu, or Ala enhanced enzyme CPT sensitivity, with the acidic residues inducing the greatest increase in drug sensitivity in vivo and in vitro. By contrast, Val or Phe substituents rendered the enzyme CPT-resistant. Mutation-induced alterations in enzyme architecture preceding the active site Tyr suggest these structural transitions modulate enzyme sensitivity to CPT, while enhancing the rate of DNA cleavage. We postulate that this conserved Gly residue provides a flexible hinge within the Top1p catalytic pocket to facilitate linker dynamics and the structural alterations that accompany drug binding of the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W2089416581,"Prohormones often undergo extensive cellular processing prior to secretion. These post-translational processing events occur in organelles of the constitutive or regulated secretory pathway. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between post-translational modifications and the secretory pathways taken by peptides derived from progastrin, the prohormone of gastrin, which in vivo is secreted by cells of the pyloric glands and stimulates the release of gastric acid. Targeting progastrin to compartments of the early secretory pathway shows that endoproteolytic processing is initiated in a pre-trans-Golgi network compartment of endocrine but not non-endocrine cells. The resulting N-terminal fragments of progastrin are secreted via the constitutive pathway, whereas endoproteolytically processed C-terminal fragments are secreted via the regulated or constitutive-like pathways. C-terminal fragments derived from progastrin differ in characteristic manners in levels and patterns of carboxyamidation and tyrosine sulfation in accordance with the secretory pathway taken. Point mutations introduced into a sorting motif disrupt these patterns, suggesting that differences in post-translational modifications are attributable to differential intracellular sorting of precursors. The results suggest a two-step sorting mechanism for progastrin leading to differential secretion of processed fragments via different secretory pathways.

The results suggest a two-step sorting mechanism for progastrin leading to differential secretion of processed fragments via different secretory pathways. Specialized secretory cells, such as neurons, endocrine, and exocrine cells, contain two classes of secretory vesicles that follow different intracellular pathways (1Burgess T.L. Kelly R.B. Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 243-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Both classes of vesicles are formed in the trans-Golgi network (2Tooze J. Tooze S.A. Fuller S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and differ in their mode of secretion. Constitutive vesicles release their cargo in an unregulated fashion, whereas mature secretory granules respond to a specific extracellular signaling. The vesicles carry different cargo thus allowing differentiated secretion of cellular products. The secretory granules are initially formed as immature granules (3Tooze S.A. Flatmark T. Tooze J. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1491-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) that undergo maturation by removal of redundant material (for review, see Refs. 4Arvan P. Castle D.

The “sorting for entry” model implicates that the TGN is the segregation point for secretory proteins, whereas the “sorting by retention” model ascribes this function to immature secretory granules. In endocrine cells, prohormones are targets for selection, because the processing to active hormones requires modifications by enzymes mainly active within the mature granules (7Muller L. Lindberg I. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 69-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).

Physiology (Bethesda). 2006; 21: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that cargo proteins, irrespective of sorting method, have to interact with a “receptor” that facilitates segregation. Such receptor function has been ascribed to specific membrane-associated proteins, e.g. the processing enzyme carboxypeptidase E (13Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), but could also be mediated by lipid rafts (14Tooze S.A. Martens G.J. Huttner W.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 116-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Alternatively, aggregation and co-aggregation with membrane-attached granins may function in the process (for review, see Ref. 9Glombik M.M. Gerdes H.H. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Irrespective of the mechanisms, sorting motifs are present in protein cargo to facilitate correct segregation. Gastrin is a gastrointestinal hormone that regulates gastric acid secretion and growth of the gastric mucosa (for reviews, see Refs. 15Rehfeld J.F. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1087-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 16Dockray G.J. Varro A. Dimaline R. Wang T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 119-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Human progastrin is an 80-amino acid protein that undergoes multiple post-translational modifications to release bioactive peptides (Fig. 1). In the trans-Golgi network, progastrin is partially tyrosine sulfated and in the secretory granules, progastrin is cleaved by the prohormone convertases PC1/3 and PC2 (17Rehfeld J.F. Lindberg I. Friis-Hansen L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Processing at the dibasic site Arg73-Arg74 followed by removal of residual basic residues by carboxypeptidase E generate the immediate gastrin precursor, often referred to as glycine-extended gastrin, a progastrin fragment suggested to have independent growth-stimulating effects (18Seva C. Dickinson C.J. Yamada T. Science. 1994; 265: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Subsequent carboxyamidation by the peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) complex completes the activation of gastrin in terms of ability to stimulate gastric acid secretion. However, even in the gastrin-producing G cells progastrin processing is incomplete, resulting in the occurrence of various processing intermediates. In a recent study we showed that two synergistically acting motifs in progastrin mediate sorting to the secretory granules. The most important motif consists of the dibasic sequences, which are also endoproteolytic cleavage sites. Another motif is a stretch of acidic residues close to the active site of gastrin (Fig. 1) (19Bundgaard J.R. Birkedal H. Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5488-5493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have analyzed the relationship between intracellular sorting and post-translational processing. To do so we examined the processing of a membrane bound chimera progastrin molecule in an early secretory compartment. We also examined differences in secretion of products at various stages of the post-translational activation and found that the products are differentially secreted. Moreover, combining these findings with the effect of mutations in a progastrin sorting motif on tyrosine sulfation allows us to propose a two-step sorting model of progastrin to the mature secretory granules. Progastrin-processing Nomenclature–The nomenclature of progastrin-derived peptide fragments in this study follows a recent proposal (20Rehfeld J.F. Bundgaard J.R. Goetze J.P. Friis-Hansen L. Hilsted L. Johnsen A.H. Regul. Pept. 2004; 120: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Human and mouse progastrin is an 80-amino acid residue precursor that is endoproteolytically cleaved at dibasic sites. Of these, cleavage at Arg73-Arg74 is necessary for bioactivation (Fig. 1). After cleavage here, residual C-terminal basic residues are removed by carboxypeptidase E leading to N-terminally truncated derivatives of progastrin. The progastrin fragments with a C-terminal glycyl residue (Gly73) are the immediate precursors of bioactive, carboxyamidated gastrins and substrates for PAM. This enzyme complex uses the C-terminal glycyl residue as an amide donor to carboxyamidate the Phe72 residue. In addition, progastrin can be cleaved at Arg36-Arg37 and Lys53-Lys54, releasing the major gastrin forms, gastrin-34 and gastrin-17. Note that in the present study, we use the term glycine-extended gastrin-17 for the processing intermediate fragment 55–72 of progastrin, and glycine-extended gastrin-34 for the intermediate fragment 37–72 of progastrin. Cell Culture and Transfections–The Syrian hamster β-cell line, HIT-T15 (ATCC), was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with Glutamax and 5 mm glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), as previously described (21Bundgaard J.R. Cowland J.B. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The cultures were incubated at 10% CO2 and 37 °C. Cells were split 1 day prior to transfections using phosphate-buffered saline-added EDTA. Gene Constructions–Human gastrin expression vectors were as previously described (21Bundgaard J.R. Cowland J.B. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The ERGIC-progastrin constructs (Fig. 2A) were constructed by ligation of a double-stranded oligonucleotide to the 3′-end of the gastrin gene. This consists of an EcoRI-linker followed by a sequence encoding the last 35 amino acids of the rat ERGIC-53 (22Lahtinen U. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Sraste J. Pettersson R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4031-4037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The sequence includes a 5-amino acid residue spacer, the transmembrane domain, and the entire cytosolic domain, including the KKFF retention motif. Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) was cloned in the translation frame into the construct using the EcoRI site. The ER and Golgi markers were YFP-expressing vectors obtained from Clontech. Expression Studies in Cell Culture–Construction of gastrin and gastrin mutant vectors and expression of these in HIT-T15 cells have previously been described (21Bundgaard J.R. Cowland J.B. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 23Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21700-21705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Expression was transient, using a modified calcium-phosphate transfection procedure. Cells were harvested 3 days after transfection for peptide analysis. Microscopy–For microscopy, cells were seeded and transfected on glass plates at a density of 30,000 cells/cm2. Cells were co-transfected using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) with YFP- and CFP-labeled ERGIC-progastrin construct and organelle marker, respectively. Forty-eight hours after transfection, living cells were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope. Preparations of Cell Extracts and Chromatography–At harvest, cells were pelleted and stored at -20 °C until extraction. Peptides were extracted by boiling cell pellets in 1 ml of water for 30 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and extracts stored at -20 °C until chromatography. Anion-exchange chromatography was performed using a fast protein liquid chromatography system with a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences), as previously described (23Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21700-21705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Gel filtration was as previously described (21Bundgaard J.R. Cowland J.B. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Radioimmunoassay–Sequence-specific radioimmunoassays for human progastrin and its processing products were used, as previously detailed. Carboxyamidated gastrins were measured in a radioimmunoassay using ab.2609, which recognizes tyrosine sulfated as well as non-sulfated gastrins (24Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4016-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The glycine-extended gastrins were measured using a radioimmunoassay based on ab.7270 (25Hilsted L. Rehfeld J.F. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To verify the identity of peaks after anion-exchange chromatography, fractions were also measured with radioimmunoassays using ab.2145 and ab.8017, which are specific for the N-terminal sequences of gastrin-34 and gastrin-17, respectively (26Bardram L. Rehfeld J.F. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1989; 49: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27van Solinge W.W. Rehfeld J.F. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1990; 192: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). N-terminal progastrin fragments were measured in a radioimmunoassay using ab.94023 raised against the N terminus of human progastrin (31Goetze J.P. Hansen C.P. Rehfeld J.F. Regul. Pept. 2006; 133: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Sulfation Ratios–Sulfation ratios, defined as percent sulfated of total amount of peptide, were determined on the basis of chromatograms, as previously described (23Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21700-21705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 28Bundgaard J.R. Johnsen A.H. Rehfeld J.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 194: 223-239PubMed Google Scholar). The two radioimmunoassays used for determination of sulfation were ab.2609 and ab.7270. During calculation, differences in cross-reactivity of the antisera were taken into account. Thus, ab.2609 cross-reacts 131% with sulfated gastrin-17, but only 63% with sulfated gastrin-34. Likewise, ab.7270 cross-reacts 133% with sulfated, glycine-extended gastrin-17-Gly and 78% with gastrin-34-Gly. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired t test, with or without Welch's correction using Prism 4.0 (GraphPad, Inc.). Early Processing Fragments Are Constitutively Secreted–To investigate the initiation site of proteolytic processing, we constructed a chimera of progastrin and the C-terminal domain of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) marker, ERGIC-53. This gene construct, denoted ERGIC-progastrin, contains the entire progastrin sequence followed by an ERGIC-53-derived transmembrane domain, including a KKFF retention motif that prevents further progression within the secretory pathway (Fig. 2A). Any secretion of fragments from this membrane-anchored protein requires proteolytic processing, and secreted fragments are thus indicators of proteolytic processing in an early secretory compartment. The β-cell line HIT-T15 was transiently transfected with ERGIC-progastrin or with wild-type progastrin, and cells and culture media were analyzed for progastrin-derived peptides. Radioimmunoassays using antisera specific for the N terminus of progastrin and for carboxyamidated gastrins showed that both ERGIC-progastrin and wild-type progastrin were well expressed, and that N-terminal fragments from ERGIC-progastrin were secreted into the media as a result of proteolytic processing (Table 1). However, only small amounts of carboxyamidated gastrins were measured after expression of ERGIC-progastrin. To determine the pathway that secreted N-terminal fragments, we stimulated secretion from the cells using 3-isobutyl-1-methylxantine as secretagogue (Fig. 2B). In the case of ERGIC-progastrin, secretion of N-terminal fragments did not respond to the secretagogue, suggesting that all N-terminal fragments were secreted constitutively. In contrast, when transfected with wild-type gastrin, the secretion of both N-terminal fragments and fully processed carboxyamidated gastrins increased in response to 3-isobutyl-1-methylxantine, although basal secretion of N-terminal fragments was higher. The results show that more N-terminal fragments are secreted constitutive-like than the carboxyamidated gastrins. In addition, N-terminal fragments are released constitutively when originating from processing in a pre-sorting compartment. Chromatography of the media using the N-terminal-specific antisera showed that secreted fragments arise from cleavage at Arg19 and/or Arg36-Arg37 in progastrin (Fig. 2C).TABLE 1Concentrations of carboxyamidated gastrins and N-terminal peptide fragments in unstimulated HIT-T15 cells transfected with wild-type gastrin expression vector or the ERGIC-progastrin construct (mean ± S.E., n = 4)Carboxyamidated gastrinsN-terminal fragmentsCellsMediaCellsMediapmol/literWild-type progastrin1489 ± 1791718 ± 1121592 ± 2244150 ± 477ERGIC-progastrin35 ± 689 ± 5937 ± 175258 ± 31 Open table in a new tab Finally, we examined whether early processing was specific for endocrine cells. In Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the ERGIC-progastrin construct we were unable to detect secreted products, although high level expression could be detected within the cells (data not shown). This finding suggests that early processing was specific for endocrine cells. ERGIC-Progastrin Localize to an Early Secretory Compartment–To determine the localization of the ERGIC-progastrin products, we fused CFP in-frame between the progastrin and the ERGIC-53-derived domains of ERGIC-progastrin. Cells transfected with this construct and co-transfected with ER- and TGN-specific markers were analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3). Overlays demonstrated that ERGIC-progastrin is co-localized with the ER marker, whereas no overlap was found with the TGN marker. This suggests that the processing occurs in an early pre-TGN compartment of the secretory pathway. To rule out that the lack of processing at Arg73-Arg74 was due to steric hindrance due to the close proximity to the transmembrane domain, peptide analysis was performed on the CFP-ERGIC-progastrin fusion, which showed an identical pattern to that of ERGIC-progastrin (data not shown). Carboxyamidated Gastrins Are Secreted Differently from their Immediate Precursors–Because secretion of N-terminal wild-type progastrin fragments responded to secretagogue but displayed a higher basal secretion than carboxyamidated gastrins, we examined whether other fragments of the C-terminal part of progastrin were also differently secreted. Fig. 4 shows that the immediate precursors of the bioactive carboxyamidated gastrins, the glycine-extended gastrins, were secreted at a higher basal level than the carboxyamidated forms. Like the N-terminal fragments from wild-type progastrin, secretion of the glycine-extended gastrins responded to the secretagogue, but the N-terminal fragments are secreted at a higher basal level than that of glycine-extended gastrins. Thus, the glycine-extended gastrins are secreted in a more constitutive-like manner than the carboxyamidated gastrins. Sulfation Stoichiometry Varies between Progastrin Derivatives–As the progastrin fragments appear to be differentially secreted, we examined whether differences in intracellular trafficking would influence other post-translational processing events. Tyrosine sulfation is an early modification that occurs in the TGN. Therefore, we compared the sulfation of the completely processed, carboxyamidated forms with the sulfation of glycine-extended gastrins. To analyze the sulfation stoichiometry of progastrin derivatives, human progastrin was transiently expressed in HIT-T15 cells. This cell line processes progastrin into gastrin-17 and gastrin-34 as well as into glycine-extended gastrin-17 and -34 at high levels. Extracts of transfected cells were subjected to anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 5). From the chromatography, different progastrin-derived fragments were quantified, and the sulfation stoichiometry was determined (Fig. 6A). The quantification showed that glycine-extended gastrin-17 was sulfated to a significantly higher degree than both glycine-extended gastrin-34 (p = 0.002) and carboxyamidated gastrin-17 (p = 0.014). In contrast, the sulfation ratio of gastrin-17 was similar to that of gastrin-34 (p = 0.2160).FIGURE 6Sulfation ratios (defined as the sulfated fraction of total amount of peptide) of the major progastrin derivatives quantified after anion exchange chromatography.

(For wild-type n = 6, for mutants n = 3.)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sulfation Pattern in Alanine Scan of the Progastrin Polyglutamate Motif–In previous studies we have examined the sulfation stoichiometry of carboxyamidated fragments of progastrin mutants substituted in the primary structure surrounding the sulfation site (23Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21700-21705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We now analyzed these mutants for the individual sulfation stoichiometry of gastrin-17 and -34, as well as their precursor forms, glycine-extended gastrin-17 and -34. On the N-terminal site of the sulfation target, at Tyr66, human progastrin has a characteristic sequence of five glutamates (Fig. 1). Except for the substitution of the most proximal residue to the tyrosine, Glu64, an alanine scan of these acidic residues revealed only small changes in the overall sulfation ratio of carboxyamidated mutant forms (23Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21700-21705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Peptides from the Glu64 mutant are highly sulfated, and therefore the major forms display only little difference in sulfation (Fig. 6B). Substitution of Glu63 with alanine reduces the overall sulfation slightly, but the individual forms all appeared equally sulfated, and the characteristic pattern of sulfation differences of wild-type gastrin processing products was absent (Fig. 6C). Similar patterns were found in substitutions of Glu62 and Glu61 (Fig. 6, D and E). However, when Glu60 was substituted with alanine, the sulfation levels were similar to that of wild-type gastrins, and the characteristic sulfation pattern was re-established (Fig. 6F). Thus, the AEEEEAY glycine-extended gastrin-17 was sulfated to a significantly higher degree than both AEEEEAY glycine-extended gastrin-34 and the carboxyamidated AEEEEAY-gastrin-17 (p = 0.002 and p = 0.008, respectively). In addition, AEEEEAY-gastrin-17 was more sulfated than AEEEEAY-gastrin-34 (p = 0.001). Therefore, the alanine scan showed that substitution of Glu residues 61–63 within the polyglutamate stretch affects the characteristic sulfation pattern of the major gastrin forms. This again suggests that there are important differences in the processing of the mutants. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between post-translational processing steps and intracellular transport of the different products of a prohormone, progastrin. The results show that N-terminal cleavage of progastrin is initiated early in the secretory pathway. The early cleavages lead to constitutive secretion of progastrin-(1–19) and progastrin-(1–35). The results also show that glycine-extended intermediate products are constitutively secreted to a higher degree than the completely processed carboxyamidated gastrins. Finally, the tyrosine sulfation pattern of progastrin derivatives mutated in one of two sorting motifs showed differences in processing that result from differences in the intracellular transport. N-terminal Processing Begins in the Early Secretory Pathway–Peptide hormones require processing for activation. One of the most common processing event is endoproteolytic cleavage by prohormone convertases (29Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Of these, PC1/3 and PC2 are the most important in endocrine cells and neurons. PC2 is mainly active in mature secretory granules at an acidic pH, whereas PC1/3 is active earlier in the secretory pathway at a neutral pH (7Muller L. Lindberg I. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 69-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To examine possible processing of progastrin in the early secretory pathway, we constructed a chimera of progastrin and the ER-Golgi-intermediate compartment marker, ERGIC-53. The C-terminal part of the chimera contains the transmembrane domain and the C-terminal KKFF retention signal of ERGIC-53 that secures ER exit and retains ERGIC-53 in the early secretory pathway (30Hauri H.P. Kappeler F. Andersson H. Appenzeller C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 587-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the ERGIC-progastrin chimera is membrane-attached, secretion of progastrin fragments after expression requires proteolytic cleavage. Expression analysis of ERGIC-progastrin in endocrine cells showed that N-terminal fragments were secreted and hence, that significant endoproteolytic cleavage did occur. Using a radioimmunoassay against the N terminus of progastrin on chromatographic fractions showed that endoproteolytic processing had occurred at both mono (Arg19) and dibasic (Arg36-Arg37) sites and that processing is specific for endocrine cells. To examine the localization of ERGIC-progastrin, another chimera, with CFP fused between the progastrin and ERGIC-53 domains, was constructed. Expression showed that ERGIC-progastrin mainly localizes to the ER. This suggests that the processing observed occurred in a pre-TGN compartment of the secretory pathway. Different Progastrin Products Are Differentially Secreted–In wild-type gastrin, secretion of both carboxyamidated gastrins and N-terminal fragments increased in response to a secretagogue, but the basal secretion of N-terminal fragments was significantly (∼3-fold) higher than for the amidated forms. In contrast, ERGIC-progastrin N-terminal processing products did not respond to secretagogue stimulation. We therefore conclude that N-terminal fragments released in the early secretory pathway, as in the case of ERGIC-progastrin, are constitutively secreted. This is in agreement with the finding that the N-terminal part of progastrin is not necessary for the production and secretion of carboxyamidated gastrin, and that sorting signals for the regulated secretory pathway are located C-terminally in progastrin (19Bundgaard J.R. Birkedal H. Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5488-5493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The observed stimulation response of the N-terminal fragments from wild-type gastrin reflects that early processing is only partial and that N-terminal processing continues throughout the secretory pathway. Recently, we examined the occurrence of N-terminally progastrin fragments in antral tissue and plasma. In accordance with the present findings, storage and secretion of N-terminal fragments and amidated gastrins differed in a manner that could not be explained by differences in metabolic clearances (31Goetze J.P. Hansen C.P. Rehfeld J.F. Regul. Pept. 2006; 133: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We also compared the secretion of glycine-extended gastrins with that of the carboxyamidated gastrins. The basal secretion of wild-type glycine-extended gastrin was higher than that of amidated gastrins (∼1.5-fold), but they still responded strongly to secretagogue. Thus, the results suggest that the three different classes of processing products of progastrin are secreted in a differentiated manner. Peptide Segregation in the Regulated Secretory Pathway Affects Gastrin Sulfation–Further examination of the relations between processing and intracellular localization included studies of tyrosine sulfation of the progastrin products that enter the regulated secretory pathway, i.e. the carboxyamidated gastrins and the glycine-extended precursors. The results revealed a sulfation pattern of wild-type gastrin in which the glycine-extended gastrins are more sulfated than the corresponding carboxyamidated forms. Previously, a similar difference was observed in rat antral tissue (32Varro A. Nemeth J. Bridson J. Lee C. Moore S. Dockray G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21476-21481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas identical sulfation ratios were reported in the hog (33Hilsted L. Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16953-16957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, shorter forms, gastrin-17 and glycine-extended gastrin-17, are more sulfated than the longer forms. This confirms previous findings that tyrosine sulfation influences the cleavage at Lys53-Lys54 (34Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3073-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), catalyzed by PC2 (17Rehfeld J.F. Lindberg I. Friis-Hansen L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). That study, however, did not discriminate between carboxyamidated and glycine-extended gastrins (34Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3073-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The observation of differences in tyrosine sulfation of the amidated and the glycine-extended gastrins is puzzling. Tyrosine sulfation is one of the earliest processing events in the TGN (35Huttner W.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), whereas amidation occurs in the secretory granules. Hence, amidation is unlikely to affect sulfation. However, tyrosine sulfation of progastrin is also unlikely to influence carboxyamidation of glycine-extended gastrins by PAM, because this enzyme complex has half of all peptide hormones as substrates and accordingly a broad specificity (36Tamburini P.P. Young S.D. Jones B.N. Palmesino R.A. Consalvo A.P. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We therefore assume that the sulfation differences should be ascribed to segregation of amidated and glycine-extended gastrins in the regulated secretory pathway and that tyrosine sulfation continues along the path predominantly followed by the glycine-extended gastrin forms. The most likely point of segregation is the immature secretory granules, as is further supported by our finding that glycine-extended gastrins are secreted more constitutive-like than the carboxyamidated gastrins. The difference in sulfation of the gastrins suggests that the sulfotransferases are sorted to immature granules, from where they are routed back to the TGN, for instance through constitutive-like secretory vesicles. More glycine-extended gastrins than carboxyamidated gastrins are present in constitutive-like secretory vesicles, and would thus be target for sulfation for a longer period than peptides sorted to the mature granules. Alternatively, the sulfotransferases are present in both the mature granules and the constitutive-like pathway, but the co-substrate needed for sulfate transfer, adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate, is excluded from the mature granules during the condensation process of immature granules. Following this notion, we analyzed the tyrosine sulfation pattern of progastrin fragments of different mutations in a region of gastrin-17, which harbors a sorting signal for regulated secretion (19Bundgaard J.R. Birkedal H. Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5488-5493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The AEEEAY-gastrin mutant derivatives displayed a differentiated sulfation pattern similar to that of wild-type gastrin. In contrast, progastrin derivatives of EEEEAAY-gastrin displayed identical sulfation ratios of all forms due to an increased sulfation in the TGN. Interestingly, sequential alanine scanning of the acidic residues Glu61-Glu63 did not increase sulfation compared with wild-type gastrin but displayed an atypical sulfation pattern with identical sulfation ratios of all peptide products. How does the sulfation pattern of the alanine scan of Glu61-Glu63 arise? We recently showed that progastrin is sorted to the regulated secretory pathway by two sequentially acting motifs: the dibasic residues constituting the main sites for endoproteolytic processing and the central acidic residues in the five polyglutamates in the gastrins (19Bundgaard J.R. Birkedal H. Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5488-5493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Regulated secretion was monitored by measurement of both basal secretion and response to a secretagogue, and the two motifs acted in synergy, suggesting temporal separation of the action of the sorting motifs. However, mutagenesis in the acidic motif alone showed little effect on the sorting in terms of changes in secretory response, suggesting that this motif acts when the peptide is already in a secretagogue responding compartment, i.e. the immature granules. We therefore propose that three of the glutamates, Glu61-Glu63, function as a sorting signal and that mutations in this domain will affect the sorting to the mature secretory granules, thereby reducing the segregation of glycine-extended and carboxyamidated forms that was observed in wild-type gastrin. Processing and Secretion of Progastrin Products Relate to Their Intracellular Transport–Based on the present results, on the knowledge of the location and activity of the processing enzymes on progastrin maturation and on the function of the two sorting domains of progastrin, we can predict the localizations of the different progastrin-processing products (Table 2): N-terminal fragments are secreted via constitutive vesicles, whereas uncleaved forms will be sorted to the regulated pathway by C-terminal signals. Carboxyamidated forms require complete C-terminal processing, including the action of PAM, which acts in the regulated secretory pathway. Accordingly, amidated gastrins can be secreted via the mature or immature secretory granules or, to some extent, via the non-responsive constitutive-like secretory pathway. Constitutive-like secretory granules arise from the condensing process of the immature secretory granules to form mature secretory granules (4Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Generally, glycine-extended gastrins are found in the same compartments as the amidated form, but the higher basal secretion suggests that more glycine-extended peptides are secreted via the constitutive-like secretory granules or maybe the constitutive vesicles.TABLE 2A summary of the secretion characteristics of progastrin-derived processing products from wild-type gastrin and ERGIC-progastrin The organelles that contain the different peptides are shown.

Physiology (Bethesda). 2006; 21: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Present models of sorting to the regulated pathway involve a single sorting step. The sorting for entry model suggests sorting from the TGN to immature granules, i.e. from a compartment insensitive to stimulation to a responsive compartment, whereas the sorting by retention model predicts sorting within stimulation-responsive granules. We propose that sorting of progastrin occurs at both levels using different sorting signals. Two-step sorting of progastrin is not simply a matter of incomplete processing. Secretion via the constitutive-like compartment offers the possibility of independent secretion of different progastrin derivatives. Although glycine-extended gastrins also are secreted in response to external stimuli both in cell lines and in vivo (37Hilsted L. Hansen C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: G665-G669PubMed Google Scholar), constitutive-like secretion may give a higher basal secretion than the carboxyamidated gastrins. Glycine-extended gastrin has aroused considerable interest as a possible growth factor with mitogenic effects on different tissues and cancers (16Dockray G.J. Varro A. Dimaline R. Wang T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 119-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Thus, independent secretion of carboxyamidated gastrin and glycine-extended gastrins might be expedient. Recently, the C-terminal flanking peptide has also been proposed to be bioactive (38Smith K.A. Patel O. Lachal S. Jennings I. Kemp B. Burgess J. Baldwin G.S. Shulkes A. Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 1463-1474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It might be another example of a value of differentiated secretion of progastrin-processing products. It was recently shown that the Rho homologous guanine exchange factors, Kalirin and Trio, can modulate secretion response of the constitutive-like vesicles and the mature granules (39Ferraro F. Ma X.-M. Sobota J.A. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4813-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, secretion of glycine-extended gastrins over gastrins might be subjected to specific regulation. In conclusion, we present a model of sorting progastrin to the mature secretory granules in two steps involving different sorting motifs. This sorting model may explain the abundance of the glycine-extended gastrins in circulation and, in addition, explain the different sulfation patterns of different progastrin derivatives. It also suggests that tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase activity is not be restricted to the TGN but continues through later compartments in the regulated secretory pathway. We are grateful to Jan K. Simonsen and Annette Bjørn for excellent technical assistance. We also thank Prof. Finn Cilius Nielsen for assistance with confocal microscopy and helpful suggestions for the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2026614899,"Two subunits of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II, Rpb7 and Rpb4, form a subcomplex that has counterparts in RNA polymerases I and III. Although a medium resolution structure has been solved for the 12-subunit RNA polymerase II, the relative contributions of the contact regions between the subcomplex and the core polymerase and the consequences of disrupting them have not been studied in detail. We have identified mutations in the N-terminal ribonucleoprotein-like domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rpb7 that affect its role in certain stress responses, such as growth at high temperature and sporulation. These mutations increase the dependence of Rpb7 on Rpb4 for interaction with the rest of the polymerase. Complementation analysis and RNA polymerase pulldown assays reveal that the Rpb4·Rbp7 subcomplex associates with the rest of the core RNA polymerase II through two crucial interaction points: one at the N-terminal ribonucleoprotein-like domain of Rpb7 and the other at the partially ordered N-terminal region of Rpb4. These findings are in agreement with the crystal structure of the 12-subunit polymerase. We show here that the weak interaction predicted for the N-terminal region of Rpb4 with Rpb2 in the crystal structure actually plays a significant role in interaction of the subcomplex with the core in vivo. Our mutant analysis also suggests that Rpb7 plays an essential role in the cell through its ability to interact with the rest of the polymerase.

Studies of transcriptional regulation have focused mainly on the role of DNA-bound regulatory proteins and their contacts with the general transcription factors, mediator, and other accessory proteins in the transcriptional machinery. In most eukaryotes, the 12-subunit RNA polymerase II (Pol II) 4The abbreviations used are: Pol IIRNA polymerase IIRNPribonucleoproteinOBoligonucleotide/oligosaccharide bindingYPDyeast extract peptone dextrose mediumTAPtandem affinity purificationWTwild typeaaamino acids. is thought to have little or no influence on the regulation of transcription. Rpb4 and Rpb7 form a subcomplex within the polymerase that dissociates easily under mild denaturing or nondenaturing conditions and shows variable association with the polymerase at different growth stages, leading to the suggestion that the subcomplex could be analogous to the σ subunit of the bacterial RNA polymerase (1Choder M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6984-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 2Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol.

Whether such a regulatory role can be ascribed to the subcomplex has been a matter of some debate, but the phenotypes of the deletion mutants and the interactions mediated by these subunits suggest that they might have some regulatory role in stress response and transcription (4Sampath V. Sadhale P. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). RNA polymerase II ribonucleoprotein oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding yeast extract peptone dextrose medium tandem affinity purification wild type amino acids. Rpb7 is essential for survival of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whereas Rpb4 is not (5McKune K. Richards K.L. Edwards A.M. Young R.A. Woychik N.A. Yeast. 1993; 9: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, rpb4Δ strains are temperature-sensitive and cold-sensitive, show poor recovery from stationary phase, are defective in sporulation (a response to severe nutritional starvation), and are predisposed to pseudohyphae formation (a response to mild nutritional starvation) (4Sampath V. Sadhale P. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Apart from its roles in stress response, Rpb4 is involved in transcription under moderate and extreme temperatures (6Pillai B. Verma J. Abraham A. Francis P. Kumar Y. Tatu U. Brahmachari S.K. Sadhale P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3339-3346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The polymerase lacking Rpb4 and Rpb7 is defective for promoter-dependent initiation of transcription but not for promoter-independent chain elongation (2Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pol II activity at extreme temperatures is dependent on the presence of Rpb4, leading to a suggestion that the Rpb4·Rbp7 subcomplex controls the stability of Pol II under extreme temperatures (7Rosenheck S. Choder M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6187-6192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, rpb4Δ strain is also defective for activated transcription from a subset of genes at moderate temperatures (8Pillai B. Sampath V. Sharma N. Sadhale P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30641-30647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Early studies showed that Pol II purified from rpb4Δ strain lacks Rpb7, suggesting that the Rpb4 stabilizes the interaction of Rpb7 with the rest of the Pol II (9Woychik N.A. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2854-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 10Sheffer A. Varon M. Choder M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2672-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Consistent with such a hypothesis, overexpression of Rpb7 can partially rescue the temperature sensitivity and sporulation defects of the rpb4Δ strain (10Sheffer A. Varon M. Choder M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2672-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Sharma N. Sadhale P.P. J. Genet. 1999; 78: 149-156Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of RPB7 can rescue activated transcription only from certain stress promoters but not from the nonstress promoters, suggesting that ScRpb7 may not have a generalized role in promoter-dependent transcription in vivo (8Pillai B. Sampath V. Sharma N. Sadhale P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30641-30647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Rpb4 plays a Rpb7-independent role in promoting mRNA export and maintaining transcript stability of a subset of genes (12Lotan R. Bar-On V.G. Harel-Sharvit L. Duek L. Melamed D. Choder M. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 3004-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 13Farago M. Nahari T. Hammel C. Cole C.N. Choder M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2744-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). On the other hand, overexpression of Rpb7 in rpb4Δ and the Σ1278b (a genetic background that shows predisposition to forming pseudohyphae) strains can lead to exaggeration of pseudohyphal growth (14Khazak V. Sadhale P.P. Woychik N.A. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 759-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Singh S.R. Rekha N. Pillai B. Singh V. Naorem A. Sampath V.

Res. Commun. 2007; 356: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that Rpb4 and Rpb7 may also exist as a subcomplex outside the context of Pol II (17Selitrennik M. Duek L. Lotan R. Choder M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 2092-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A single model that will explain all the phenotypes observed with the mutants of the two subunits is yet to be proposed (4Sampath V. Sadhale P. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Rpb7 is highly conserved from archaea to humans with sequence identity at 40–70% between the eukaryotic homologs. Sequence alignment of the eukaryotic Rpb7 subunits shows that the central region (residues 63–82) essential for viability of S. cerevisiae is highly conserved (18Sadhale P.P. Woychik N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6164-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The high sequence conservation of Rpb7 is mirrored by the ability of many of the eukaryotic homologs (from humans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Candida albicans, and Dictyostelium discoideum) to rescue the lethality of S. cerevisiae rpb7Δ strain (14Khazak V. Sadhale P.P. Woychik N.A. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 759-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Singh S.R. Rekha N. Pillai B. Singh V. Naorem A. Sampath V.

Sakurai H. Proshkin S.A. Van Mullem V. Ishihama A. Thuriaux P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1119-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure determination of ScRpb4·Rbp7 and their homologs from humans and archaea (RpoF/RpoE) show that the major features of the structures are superimposable to a large extent (20Armache K.J. Mitterweger S. Meinhart A. Cramer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7131-7134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 21Meka H. Werner F. Cordell S.C. Onesti S. Brick P.

Cell. 2001; 8: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Rpb7 consists of two putative single-stranded RNA-binding domains; the N terminus folds into a truncated RNP structure, whereas the C-terminal half of the molecule forms an OB fold. The bottom region of the RNP domain (the “tip loop”) comprises many surface-exposed residues that are highly conserved, and the crystal structure of the 12-subunit complex shows that this region is the main anchorage point for the interaction with the Pol II core (20Armache K.J. Mitterweger S. Meinhart A. Cramer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7131-7134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Despite the structural similarity to other RNP domains, site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggest that the residues contributing to RNA binding in the N-terminal domain are not located on the canonical face of the RNP fold (21Meka H. Werner F. Cordell S.C. Onesti S. Brick P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6435-6444Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The presence of an OB fold in the C-terminal domain was predicted based on the presence of a sequence pattern characteristic of the S1 motif (a subgroup of OB fold proteins) (23Orlicky S.M. Tran P.T. Sayre M.H. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10097-10102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The OB fold comprises a five-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel with a number of conserved surface-exposed residues on one face of the barrel, which have been shown to be involved in RNA binding (21Meka H. Werner F. Cordell S.C. Onesti S. Brick P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6435-6444Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A unique feature of the Rpb7 OB fold is the presence of a long insertion between strand B3 and B4, where a short 310 helix (which is present in all the S1 domains) is followed by a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet. The crystal structure of the archaeal complex suggested a model for the function of the heterodimer in which the S1 motif of Rpb7 interacts with the nascent RNA transcript, possibly assisted by the truncated RNP domain (22Todone F. Brick P. Werner F. Weinzierl R.O. Onesti S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The location of the Rpb4·Rbp7 heterodimer in the polymerase based on the low resolution crystal structure of the 12-subunit Pol II (24Armache K.J. Kettenberger H. Cramer P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6964-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 25Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6969-6973Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) confirmed that Rpb7 is in a position to interact with the nascent RNA transcript released from the transcribing complex. This prediction has been recently validated by UV cross-linking studies (26Ujvari A. Luse D.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although the subcomplex has been shown to bind the nascent transcript, a clearly defined molecular function for the subcomplex has not yet emerged. The structure of the 12-subunit RNA polymerase from S. cerevisiae determined at higher resolution allowed a more detailed view of the interaction between the Rpb4·Rpb7 complex and the polymerase core (20Armache K.J. Mitterweger S. Meinhart A. Cramer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7131-7134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The tip loop of the RNP domain of Rpb7 interacts with a region of Pol II made up of the linker region of Rpb1 and Rpb6. Furthermore, the authors propose that the N-terminal residues of Rpb4 maybe involved in the interaction with Rpb2. However, the relative contributions of the reported points of interaction between the subcomplex and the core polymerase II and the consequences of disrupting them have not been studied in detail. Given the essential nature of Rpb7, the complexity of its roles in multiple phenotypes and the lack of useful information from deletion-based analyses, we decided to use genetic screens to isolate mutants of RPB7. In this report, we present the characterization of a loss of function mutant rpb7–7, which, in combination with a previously reported deletion of Rpb4 (27Sampath V. Rekha N. Srinivasan N. Sadhale P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51566-51576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), reveals how the subcomplex interacts with the rest of the Pol II. Yeast Strains–The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. These strains were transformed with the appropriate plasmids and assayed for various phenotypes. Yeast transformations were performed routinely using the modified lithium acetate protocol that does not involve heat treatment of cells (28Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983Google Scholar). For high efficiency transformation for the genetic screens, the method of Finley and Brent (29Finley R.L. Brent R. Bartel P.L. Fields S. The yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1997: 197-214Google Scholar) was followed. Yeast strains were grown in rich YPD medium or in synthetic dextrose medium containing 2% glucose or 2% galactose as a carbon source and the required amino acids.TABLE 1List of strains used in this workStrainGenotypeSourceSY10MATa, leu2-3, lys2-112, ura3-52, rpb4Δ::HIS3Ref. 8Pillai B.

The plasmid pVS154 expressing the rpb7–7 mutant and the plasmid pSP186 expressing wild type RPB7 from pPS7 were used to separate the N- and the C-terminal mutations of rpb7–7. The plasmid, pVS357 expressing the rpb7–7 N-terminal mutations was generated by a three-way ligation between a 0.9-kb EcoRI-DraI fragment from pVS154, a 0.5-kb DraI-SalI fragment from pSP186, and the EcoRI-SalI-digested pPS7. The plasmid pVS358 expressing the rpb7–7 C-terminal mutations was generated by a three-way ligation between a 0.95-kb BamHI-DraI fragment from pVS154, a 0.9-kb DraI-SalI fragment from pSP186, and the BamHI-SalI-digested pPS7. Plasmids pBB651 and pBB652 are the WT RPB7 and the rpb7–7 mutant alleles from the pVS186 and pVS154 plasmid, respectively, subcloned in the plasmid pPS6 (YEplac112) with TRP1 auxotrophic marker to enable us to accommodate all the plasmids used in this work. Plasmid YKL 187 for amplification of the degron cassette was obtained from Euroscarf (Frankfurt, Germany). Construction of the TAP-tagged Strains–The N-Deg7 strain was generated by fusing the Rpb7 open reading frame in YKL200 strain with the N-degron cassette amplified with the plasmid YKL187 as template and primers (5′-GTT TCT CCT CCT ACA CCA TTC TCC TTT GCG ATT AGA CAG TGG GAA AGT CCA TTA AGG CGC GCC AGA TCT G-3′ and 5′-AAG GAC GGA TGA AGG GTA ATA TTA AGC GAA AGG TCT TTA ATA AAA AAC ATG GCA CCC GCT CCA GCG CCT G-3′) (30Kanemaki M. Sanchez-Diaz A. Gambus A. Labib K. Nature. 2003; 423: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Strain SC1126 was crossed with the Y07005 (rpb4Δ) strain to obtain rpb4Δ strain containing the TAP-tagged Rpb3 fusion. This haploid transformed with the different RPB4 alleles was crossed to the N-Deg7 strain transformed with different RPB7 alleles and segregants expressing C-terminal TAP tag Rpb3 and N-deg-Rpb7 fusion proteins in both wild type as well as rpb4Δ background were obtained. The haploids were selected on YPDCuSO4 with 500 μg/ml G418 because the N-deg Rpb7 open reading frame is under the control of CUP1 promoter, and the rpb4Δ is marked with kanr resistance. Colony size, rate of growth, and temperature sensitivity were used as parameters for initial screening of rpb4Δ strains and wild type strain because rpb4Δ strains are temperature-sensitive and slow growing with small colony size. The haploid isolates were further confirmed by PCR specific for the N-Deg Rpb7 module and the rpb4Δ locus and by Western blotting with New Zealand White rabbit serum to detect the TAP-tagged moiety in WT and rpb4Δ strains. To check survival of the cells at 37 °C in the presence of high levels of the galactose-inducible Ubr1 protein, both the strains were grown on yeast extract peptone galactose medium and incubated at 37 °C. Temperature Sensitivity, Sporulation, and Pseudohyphal Growth–These assays were performed essentially as described before (8Pillai B. Sampath V. Sharma N. Sadhale P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30641-30647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The assay for temperature sensitivity was performed on synthetic dextrose plates containing 2% glucose at 25 or 37 °C. The assays for sporulation and pseudohyphal growth were done on 1% potassium acetate plates and on synthetic low ammonia dextrose medium, respectively. Random Spore Analysis–Sporulated cultures were treated with lyticase (1 mg/ml in 1 m sorbitol) for 30 min to 1 h, vortexed with an equal volume of mineral oil for 2 min, and centrifuged for 30 s. The mineral oil layer enriched with hydrophobic spores was plated on appropriate selection medium. TAP Tag-based Pol II Pulldowns (31Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A.

The cells were pelleted and washed in sterile water, freeze-thawed in liquid nitrogen, and then resuspended in 250 μl of whole cell extract lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 300 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitors). The cells were lysed with the addition of chilled glass beads by four cycles of 1 min of vortexing alternating with 5 min cooling on ice. The lysates were clarified at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Invitrogen). Approximately 1.5 mg of total protein was used for TAP tag purification or immunoprecipitation. TAP-tagged extracts were incubated with 40 μl of rabbit IgG-agarose at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads, equilibrated in TEV protease cleavage buffer, were washed three times with 1 ml of the same buffer. The proteins were eluted from the beads with the addition of 2.5 units of TEV protease in 50 μl of TEV protease cleavage buffer. The eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting to identify the interaction of the subcomplex with the rest of the Pol II. The N-deg Rpb7 and rpb7–7 alleles were monitored using α-Rpb7 antibodies generated in the laboratory. The α-Rpb4 antibody procured from Neoclone Inc. was raised against the N-terminal region of Rpb4 and hence would not recognize the Rpb4-(33–221) allele described here. Although the Rpb4-(33–221) allele cannot be recognized by the α-Rpb4 antibody, the protein is being made and is stable because it can complement the stress response defects of rpb4Δ (27Sampath V.

Genetic Screen Allowed Isolation of Conditional Mutants of RPB7–We used a genetic screen to isolate conditional “loss of function” alleles of RPB7. Fig. 1A shows a schematic representation of the screen used to isolate mutants of Rpb7 gene carried on a 2μ plasmid. Briefly, a gapped plasmid was generated that had 650 bp of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of RPB7 at its linearized ends. This gapped plasmid was transformed along with a PCR-mutagenized RPB7 gene pool into the heterozygous RPB7/rpb7Δ strain, SYD7. At the time of carrying out the screen, the only available rpb7Δ mutant was marked with LEU2, and the complementation studies were carried out with the RPB7 gene on a plasmid carrying the URA3 gene. Hence a conventional plasmid shuffle screen was not possible. The transformants were pooled and sporulated, and haploids were generated by random spore analysis. rpb7Δ haploids carrying the in vivo recombined plasmid were selected based on their abilities to grow in the absence of leucine and uracil, ensuring the selection of rpb7Δ cells and the plasmid, respectively. The random spore analysis was standardized to ensure minimal contamination with diploids, and the haploids were confirmed by mating type PCR analysis. These haploids were further screened for temperature sensitivity at 37 °C. The plasmids isolated from the putative mutants were analyzed for various stress phenotypes associated with rpb4Δ and rpb7Δ strains. Of the 6000 transformants screened, 70 haploids showed the temperature-sensitive phenotype. Of these, six alleles that showed consistent phenotypes after multiple rounds of screening were used for further characterization. These mutants were compared with wild type RPB7 in various assays in rpb7Δ and rpb4Δ strains. The ability of the plasmid borne alleles to complement the lethality of rpb7Δ strain was tested by retransforming the RPB7/rpb7Δ (SYD7) and carrying out random spore analysis. We defined the percentage of survival as the percentage of haploids carrying a certain genotype among all haploids generated from the sporulated SYD7 strain by random spore analysis. Complementation of the lethality of rpb7Δ by wild type RPB7 results in 50% survival. All of the mutants analyzed showed ability to complement rpb7Δ at room temperature (data not shown), but the sensitivity of the mutants to high temperature varied to a great extent (Fig. 1B). As mentioned earlier and also seen in Fig. 2, rpb4Δ mutant is temperature-sensitive, defective in sporulation, and predisposed to pseudohyphae formation. Overexpression of RPB7 in rpb4Δ rescues the temperature sensitivity at 34 °C but not at 37 °C. It also rescues the sporulation defect but exaggerates the pseudohyphal morphology. The six mutants analyzed for the rescue of the above phenotypes in rpb4Δ strain showed that except for rpb7–7, all alleles were able to rescue temperature sensitivity, whereas some alleles along with rpb7–7 were unable to rescue sporulation defect. Interestingly, all of them exaggerated the pseudohyphal phenotype. Table 2 summarizes the phenotypes of these mutants.TABLE 2Summary of phenotypes of the different loss of function mutants isolated in the genetic screen in rpb7Δ and rpb4Δ strainsAlleleSequence changesrpb7Δrpb4ΔGrowth at 38 °CProtein levelGrowth at 34 °CSporulationPseudohyphal growthProtein levelRPB7None+++++++rpb7-7F70L, V72M, A123E, S125T++--+++rpb7-18D50A, T138P--+±++-rpb7-34I147G+++++++++rpb7-61S162T±++-+++rpb7-62S162T-+++++++rpb7-63ND±++-+++ Open table in a new tab In this report, we present detailed characterization of the rpb7–7 mutant, which has provided us with a new insight into the interaction between Rpb7 and Rpb4 and the function of the subcomplex. The rpb7–7 mutant was chosen because it has interesting phenotypes in the absence of Rpb4 but behaved like the WT protein in the presence of Rpb4. The plasmid from rpb7–7 mutant was isolated and retransformed into SYD7 to confirm that the lethality of rpb7Δ can be complemented by the mutant as well as RPB7. In addition, the mutant allele does not compromise the growth of rpb7Δ significantly at higher temperature (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the rpb7–7 allele, when compared with the wild type RPB7 expressed from a similar 2μ plasmid, shows a clear defect in its ability to rescue the temperature sensitivity and sporulation defects of rpb4Δ strain (Fig. 2, A and B). However, its ability to enhance the pseudohyphal morphology of rpb4Δ strain is not affected (Fig. 2C). The steady state protein level of the rpb7–7 allele in rpb4Δ and rpb7Δ strains is stable and expressed at similar levels as wild type Rpb7 in both rpb4Δ and rpb7Δ strains (data not shown). Thus the defective sporulation and temperature sensitivity seen for the rpb7–7 allele in rpb4Δ is not the result of reduction in the level of the mutant protein. The RNP Fold of Rpb7 Is an Important Functional Determinant–Rpb7 folds into two domains: an N-terminal truncated RNP fold and a C-terminal OB fold (Fig. 3A). Sequencing of the rpb7–7 allele revealed that it had four mutations (F70L, V72M, A123E, and S125T). The first two mutated residues are located on a conserved β-strand of the RNP fold, whereas the other two mutated residues are on the three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet insertion between strands B3 and B4 of the OB fold domain (Fig. 3A). The phenotype of rpb7–7 could be the consequence of a disrupted RNP fold or could be caused by alterations in the interactions mediated by the solvent-exposed C-terminal β-sheet or both. To distinguish between these possibilities, we swapped the N- and C-terminal domains of the mutant with the wild type Rpb7 to construct rpb7–7N allele carrying only the F70L and V72M mutations and the rpb7–7C allele carrying only the A123E and S125T mutations. Both of these mutant alleles could complement the l"

Mutations of Arg-290 (M3–M4 loop), Lys-958, and Thr-960 (M9 – M10 loop) had minor effects on ATPase activity and Ca2+ transport. On the other hand, Val-304 (M4) mutations to Ile, Thr, Lys, Ala, or Glu inhibited transport by 90–95% while reducing ATP hydrolysis by 83% (Ile, Thr, and Lys), 56% (Ala), or 45% (Glu). Val-304 participates in Ca2+ coordination with its main-chain carbonyl oxygen, and this function is not expected to be altered by mutations of its side chain. In fact, despite turnover inhibition, the Ca2+ concentration dependence of residual ATPase activity remained unchanged in Val-304 mutants. However, the rates (but not the final levels) of phosphoenzyme formation, as well the rates of its hydrolytic cleavage, were reduced in proportion to the ATPase activity. Furthermore, with the Val-304 → Glu mutant, which retained the highest residual ATPase activity, it was possible to show that occlusion of bound Ca2+ was also impaired, thereby explaining the stronger inhibition of Ca2+ transport relative to ATPase activity. The effects of Val-304 mutations on phosphoenzyme turnover are attributed to interference with mechanical links that couple movements of transmembrane segments and headpiece domains. The effects of thermal activation energy on reaction rates are thereby reduced. Furthermore, inadequate occlusion of bound Ca2+ following utilization of ATP in Val-304 side-chain mutations is attributed to inadequate stabilization of the Glu-309 side chain and consequent defect of its gating function.

SERCA is a membrane-bound protein that includes ten transmembrane helical segments (M1 to M10), and three headpiece domains (“N,” “P,” and “A”) protruding from the cytosolic side of the membrane (1MacLennan D.H.

Nature. 1993; 362: 469-471Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The catalytic and transport cycle begins with high affinity binding of two Ca2+ derived from the cytoplasmic medium (“outside”), followed by ATP utilization to form a phosphorylated enzyme intermediate. The bound Ca2+ then undergoes dissociation onto the luminal side (“inside”) of the membrane, against a concentration gradient. Finally, hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphoenzyme completes the cycle (3de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 4Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Due to a relatively large distance between Ca2+ binding in the transmembrane region and the ATP site in the headpiece domains, coupling of ATP utilization and Ca2+ transport requires a “long range intramolecular linkage,” which is operated by protein conformational changes (5Toyoshima C.

Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar) studies have shown that, within the membrane-bound region of the ATPase, the Asn-768, Glu-771, Thr-799, Asp-800, and Glu-908 side chains, and two water molecules, contribute oxygen atoms for Ca2+ coordination on site I. Ca2+ binding on neighboring site II is stabilized by Glu-309 (M4), Asn-796, and Asp800 (M6) side chain, as well as by Val-304, Ala-305, and Ile-307 (M4) main-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms. Binding of the two Ca2+ is cooperative (10Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and single mutations in site I prevent binding at either site. On the other hand, following single mutations on site II, the enzyme retains non-cooperative binding of one Ca2+ on site I. Most importantly, occupancy of site II by Ca2+ is required to trigger the long range conformational change permitting activation of the catalytic site and utilization of ATP (11Andersen J.P.

Squier T.C. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6952-6962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) while the bound Ca2+ undergoes a process of occlusion, which prevents isotopic exchange with medium Ca2+ (12Inesi G. Ma H.

The phosphoenzyme intermediate (ADP·E1P·2Ca2+) then undergoes a further conformational transition (17Olesen C. Sorensen T.L. Nielsen R.C. Moller J.V. Nissen P.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), coupled with dissociation of ADP into the cytosolic medium and Ca2+ dissociation into the luminal medium. Finally, the so derived phosphoenzyme conformer (E2P) undergoes hydrolytic cleavage. The entire cycle is reversible, starting with enzyme phosphorylation by Pi in the absence of Ca2+ (20Masuda H. de Meis L. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4581-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and ending with synthesis of ATP upon addition of Ca2+ and ADP (21de Meis L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 402: 535-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). With the experiments described here we mutated several amino acids near and distal to the Ca2+ binding sites, with the initial intention of exploring a possible interference with the exit of transported Ca2+ through the luminal side of the membrane. However, as we studied step by step the sequential reactions involved in utilization of ATP and Ca2+ transport, the most interesting finding was that the well conserved Val-304 residue sustains an important role in allowing conformational transitions coupled with utilization of ATP by the Ca2+ activated enzyme. PCR Mutagenesis and Protein ExpressionThe chicken fast muscle SERCA-1 cDNA (22Karin N.J. Kaprielian Z. Fambrough D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1978-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the SV40-pAdlox vector for site-directed mutagenesis. Primers of 20–30 bp in length were synthesized for each individual mutation. These primers were utilized to anneal the DNA sequences internal to the flanking primers and were used for PCR mutagenesis by overlap extension (23Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The mutant DNA fragment was then exchanged with the corresponding fragment of WT cDNA in SV40-pAdlox. After DNA sequencing, the cDNA was transfected into COS-1 cells for overexpression of protein under the control of SV40 promoter (24Sumbilla C. Lu L. Lewis D.E. Inesi G. Ishii T. Takeyasu K. Feng Y. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21185-21192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, WT SERCA and selected mutants (Val-304 → Glu, Asn-796 → Ala, and Glu-309 → Gln) were obtained by exogenous gene expression in COS-1 cells infected with adenovirus vectors carrying the corresponding cDNA (25Zhang Z. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Summers S. Klein M.G. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomal Preparation and Immunodetection of Expressed ProteinThe microsomal fraction of transfected or infected COS-1 cells was obtained by differential centrifugation of homogenized cells (25Zhang Z. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Summers S. Klein M.G. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunodetection of expressed ATPase in the microsomal fraction was obtained by Western blotting using 9E10 monoclonal antibody against the c-Myc tag of SERCA-1. Functional StudiesFor all functional measurements the protein concentration of microsomes containing mutant SERCA-1 was corrected by the expression level revealed by Western blots with reference to WT enzyme, so that the final functional level refer to the same concentration of recombinant enzyme. SERCA ATPase activity was assayed in 1 ml of reaction mixture containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium azide, 30 μg of total microsomal protein, 3 μm ionophore A23187, 3 mm ATP, in the absence (with 2 mm EGTA and without any addition of Ca2+) or presence of 10 μm free Ca2+. The reaction was started at 37 °C by adding ATP, and samples were taken at serial times for Pi determination (26Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-dependent activity was calculated by subtracting the Ca2+-independent ATPase activity from the total ATPase activity and then corrected by the expression level ratio between the wild-type and mutant microsomes revealed by Western blot assay. The Ca2+ dependence of SERCA ATPase activity was measured under the same condition except that serial concentrations of free Ca2+ were established by adding various amount of EGTA to reaction mixtures containing 0.1 mm CaCl2. Ca2+ transport by SERCA was measured at 25 °C in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 μg of microsomal protein/ml, 5 mm potassium oxalate, 10 μm free Ca2+ with [45Ca] tracer. ATP (3 mm) was added to start the reaction, and at various times 1 ml of reaction mixture was loaded onto a 0.45-μm Millipore Filter by vacuum suction and washed with 15 ml of 2 mm LaCl3 and 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. The filter was then processed for determination of radioactivity by scintillation counting. Enzyme phosphorylation by ATP was measured in an ice-cold reaction mixture containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm free Ca2+, 5 μm A23187, 100 μg of microsomal protein from COS-1 cells transfected with wild-type SERCA-1 or mutated cDNA. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP and quenched at various times with 1 m perchloric acid. Enzyme phosphorylation by Pi was obtained at 35 °C for 10 min in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 20% (CH3)2SO, 0.5 mm (32P)Pi, and 100 μg of microsomal protein from COS-1 cells transfected with wild-type SERCA-1 or mutated cDNA. The reaction was quenched with 1 m perchloric acid. Decay experiments with phosphoenzyme obtained by utilization of ATP were performed in an ice-cold reaction mixture containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm free Ca2+, 5 μm A23187, and 50 μg of microsomal protein. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and after 30 s the [γ-32P]phosphoenzyme was chased by the addition of 0.5 mm non-radioactive ATP. Then the reaction was quenched at various times by the addition of 1 m perchloric acid. In all cases, the quenched reaction mixture was loaded onto a 0.45-μm Millipore Filter and washed with 20 ml of 0.125 m perchloric acid and 10 ml of water. The filter was then processed for determination of radioactivity by scintillation counting. Decay of phosphoenzyme obtained by utilization of Pi was started by a 5-fold dilution of the phosphorylation mixture with a medium containing 50 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, and 5 mm Pi at 20 °C. The decay reaction was quenched at various times by the addition of 1 m perchloric acid, filtered, and processed as described above. Calcium binding to the ATPase was determined by incubating COS-1 microsomal vesicles (100 μg/ml) in a medium containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 μm A23187 calcium ionophore, and 10 μm [45Ca]Ca2+ (including contaminant Ca2+). Determination of the time course of Ca2+ dissociation from the fluoroaluminate-bound SERCA form was performed in the same reaction mixture but with the addition of 1 mm ADP, 50 μm AlCl3, and 2 mm potassium fluoride. Thapsigargin (TG) was added to half of the samples (1 μm) to provide controls exhibiting no specific Ca2+ binding in both conditions. Following 30-min incubation at 25 °C, 1-ml samples were placed on a 0.45-μm Millipore filter, and the medium was removed by suction. The vesicles were then perfused with 10 mm EGTA for dissociation of bound [45Ca]Ca2+. The experiments were performed in a BioLogic rapid filtration apparatus, and the filters were then blotted and processed for determination of radioactivity by scintillation counting. We produced several site-directed, single mutations of amino acids residing within or distal to the Ca2+ binding domain, including the M1, M2, and M4 transmembrane helices as well as on the M3/M4 and M9/M10 loops (Table 1). Mutations of Leu-75 or Phe-88 (M1 and M2) to Ala, Glu, or Lys strongly reduced the SERCA protein expression, likely due to interference with transcription or, possibly, enhancement of mRNA turnover. In fact, an 80–85% reduction of mRNA levels was demonstrated by Northern blots and reverse transcription-PCR (not shown). On the other hand, mutations of Arg-290, Val-304, Lys-958, or Thr-960 resulted in protein expression at levels nearly as high, or moderately lower than the WT ATPase (Table 1). Expression of WT, Val-304 → Glu, Asn-796 → Ala, and Glu-309 → Gln in COS-1 cells infected with adenovirus vectors (8Strock C. Cavagna M. Peiffer W.E. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Inesi G. J. Biol.

On the other hand, interesting functional effects were obtained with Val-304 mutations (M4 transmembrane helix). These mutations did not interfere with protein expression, but inhibited almost completely Ca2+ transport in all cases, while reducing to various extents the ATPase activity (Figs. 1B and 2B). An overall account of mutations, levels of expressed protein, and residual functional activities is given in Table 1. It is of interest that the Ca2+ concentration dependence of the residual ATPase activity was not altered by Val-304 mutations (Fig. 3), even though the steady-state velocity (i.e. enzyme turnover) was reduced. This indicates that high affinity Ca2+ binding is not affected by Val-304 mutations. On the other hand, we found that the rates of phosphoenzyme formation by utilization of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of Ca2+ were reduced, although steady-state levels of phosphoenzyme equal to those obtained with WT enzyme were finally reached with all mutants, as demonstrated in Fig. 4 for the Val-304 → Glu and Val-304 → Ala mutants. We then proceeded to determine the time dependence of phosphoenzyme decay by first obtaining maximal levels of [32P]phosphoenzyme with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of Ca2+, and then diluting the medium with excess non-radioactive ATP. Under these conditions, the decay of [32P]phosphoenzyme represents the overall time dependence of the ADP·E1·P·2Ca2+ ↔ ADP + Ca2+in + E2P ↔ E2 + Pi sequence. It is shown in Fig. 5 that the rate of decay is clearly reduced by Val-304 mutations to Glu or Ala, in proportion to reduction of overall ATPase activity. In fact, the rate of decay was reduced even further (not shown) for Val-304 → Lys, Val-304 → Thr, and Val-304 → Ile in accordance with the more drastic reduction of ATPase activity (Table 1).FIGURE 2ATP dependent Ca2+ transport by microsomal vesicles containing WT ATPase and various mutants (A and B).

Steady-state ATPase rates were obtained as described in the legend for Fig. 2. Because no statistically significant difference between WT and mutant experimental points was observed, a single average value per each Ca2+ concentration was used to obtain the best fit with a SigmaPlot binding equation, yielding E50 = 6.43 ± 0.03 and Hill slope = 1.85 ± 0.5. Various symbols stand for WT protein and different Val-304 mutants, with no significant difference from each other. The reduced levels obtained with high Ca2+ are due to previously described competition with Mg2+ and are not included in the fitting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Time course of phosphorylated intermediate formation by WT ATPase and Val-304 mutants.

In agreement with the phosphoenzyme levels obtained with ATP, we found that following 5-min incubation at 25 °C, similar levels of phosphoenzyme were obtained with WT protein and Val-304 mutants. It is reassuring that decay of E2P obtained with recombinant WT protein occurs at a nearly identical rate as that of the E2P obtained with the native ATPase of muscle SR vesicles (Fig. 6). However, even in this case, hydrolytic cleavage of E2P obtained with mutant protein proceeded at slower rates (Fig. 6), in proportion to the overall reduction of ATPase activity. Finally, to explain the stronger reduction of Ca2+ transport, despite significant residual ATPase activity (Table 1), we tested the ability of the Val-304 → Glu mutant to retain occluded Ca2+ following enzyme phosphorylation by ATP. Occlusion of bound Ca2+ can be demonstrated by trapping radioactively labeled [45Ca]Ca2+ in the stable ADP-fluoroaluminate transition analog of the ADP·E1·P·2Ca2+ intermediate, and measuring the rate of exchange with (non-radioactive) Ca2+ added to the medium. To obtain sufficient signal intensity for these measurements, we constructed adenovirus vectors carrying WT and Val-304 → Glu SERCA cDNA under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter for efficient gene transfer and protein expression in COS-1 cells. The yield of recombinant protein in cells infected with adenovirus vector turned out to be ∼7-fold higher than in cells subjected to simple transfections (Table 1). It is shown in Fig. 7 that the WT enzyme retains the occluded [45Ca]Ca2+ for at least 2 s before significant exchange with medium Ca2+ is noted. On the other hand, exchange occurs with a 0.5-s half time when the Val-304 → Glu mutant is used. This behavior is similar to that observed with the Glu-309 → Gln and Asn-796 → Ala mutants (12Inesi G. Ma H. Lewis D. Xu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31629-31637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), although the release of occluded [45Ca]Ca2+ is affected to a different extent by the three mutations (Fig. 7). None of these three mutants sustains significant Ca2+ transport activity (Table 1). It should be pointed out that the Glu-309 and Asn-796 are involved with their side chains in Ca2+ coordination at site II. For this reason, the Glu-309 → Gln and Asn-796 → Ala mutants retain binding of only one Ca2+ at site I, whereas the lack of Ca2+ on site II completely prevents ATPase activation. On the other hand, Val-304 participates in coordination with its main carbonyl oxygen, and its side-chain mutation to Glu allows retention of significant ATPase activity (Table 1). The most important results of the experiments reported here are related to Val-304 mutations, whose inhibition of Ca2+ transport was noted previously (27Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Rice W.J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18358-18364Google Scholar, 28Chen L. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Zhong L. Strock C. Kirtley M.E. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10745-10752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Five different mutations of this amino acid did not interfere significantly with protein expression, but strongly inhibited Ca2+ transport, while ATPase activity was inhibited (Table 1) 83% by the Val-304 → Ile, Thr, and Lys mutations, 56% by the Val-304 → Ala mutation, and 45% by the Val-304 → Glu mutation. The Ca2+ concentration dependence of the residual ATPase activity was not affected by Val-304 mutations, indicating that high affinity Ca2+ binding occurred normally. This is not surprising, because Val-304 participates in Ca2+ coordination with its main-chain carbonyl oxygen (Fig. 8), and not with the side chain, which is subjected to mutations. However, characterization of the subsequent partial reactions of the ATPase cycle revealed inhibition of the rates of phosphoenzyme formation and cleavage, which, depending on the specific mutation, was proportional to the overall reduction of ATPase activity. It is important to notice that the rates of phosphoenzyme formation and turnover, but not the maximal levels of phosphoenzyme, were significantly reduced. Val-304 is a well conserved residue, which, as mentioned above, contributes with its main-chain carbonyl oxygen to coordination of Ca2+ bound at site II within the transmembrane region (Fig. 8). The question is then why mutation of the Val-304 side chain, located in the M4 transmembrane segment (Fig. 9), reduces the rates of phosphoenzyme formation and cleavage occurring at a relatively large distance within the P domain of the ATPase headpiece. It should be noted in this regard that the M4 helix is integrated with the P domain through structural continuity. Perturbations of catalytic and transport activity by mutations on the M4 segment approaching the P domain were previously noted (25Zhang Z. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Summers S. Klein M.G. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to consider in this regard that a global involvement of the ATPase protein conformation takes place, as ATP utilization, isomerization of the resulting intermediate, and phosphoenzyme hydrolytic cleavage are accompanied by large movements of the headpiece domains with mechanical links to movements and bending of transmembrane helices. In fact, following nucleotide substrate binding and in concomitance with A domain tilting, the M1 helix is displaced by two helical turns in the direction of the cytosolic surface of the membrane, and relative to M4 (13Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). M1 then approximates M4 and limits movements of the Glu-309 side chain, which is also stabilized by interactions with Asn-796 and Leu-65. In this state, the upper M4 segment pulls down the P domain, whereas the lower M4 undergoes angular bending. The N domain then approximates with a swinging movement, and an overall conformation that favors catalytic activation and phosphoenzyme formation is reached. As for enzyme phosphorylation with Pi and its hydrolytic cleavage (E2 → E2P and E2P → E2 reactions), a behavior similar to that produced by Val-304 mutants is observed following a proteinase K cut at Lys-120 (29Lenoir G. Picard M. Gauron C. Montigny C. Le Marechal P. Falson P. le Maire M. Moller J.V. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9156-9166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this case the reaction rates, but not the final phosphoenzyme levels, are reduced. In fact, movements of the A domain and of the M4 lower segment occur in these reactions, again coupled through important mechanical links. As a consequence of perturbations of these mechanical links, such as evidently produced by interference with Val-304 optimal fitting, the movements of M4 lower segment and of the A domain become to some extent independent. The A domain is then less likely to move, with consequent stabilization of the E2 state and resistance to phosphorylation by Pi. Conversely, once E2P is formed, impairment of mechanical links renders the cytosolic domains less sensitive to movements of the transmembrane helices, with consequent stabilization of the phosphoenzyme. A role of Val-304 in concerted movements of transmembrane helices through van der Waals contacts with Ile-94 (M2) and Leu-65 (M1) appears (Fig. 9, c and d) in recently obtained structures of E1·AlF4·ADP, E2·BeF3·(-TG), E2·BeF3·TG, and E2·AlF4·(TG) forms of the ATPase (PDB ID codes 2ZBD, 2ZBE, 2ZBF, and 2ZBG; ref. 30Toyoshima C. Norimatsu Y. Iwasawa S. Tsuda T. Ogawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 19831-19836Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). An important point to note is that the rates of reactions, rather than the final levels of intermediate, are affected by the Val-304 mutations. To explain this effect, we consider that the headpiece domains are quite constrained following ATP binding and establishment of hydrogen bonds. For this reason, phosphoenzyme turnover is rate-limiting and requires significant energy of activation. In fact, thermal motion develops mostly in the transmembrane region, and is normally transmitted to the headpiece domain as activation energy. However, proper packing of the helices is required for transmission of thermal motion (i.e. energy of activation) to the headpiece. It is then apparent that optimal mechanical coupling require proper positioning of Val-304 (see relationship with M1 and M2 helices in Fig. 9), whereas mutational interference with this transmission reduces the reaction rates. Impairment of mechanical links, as evidently produced by mutations of the well conserved Val-304 residue, diminishes significantly the long range effect of thermal perturbation. Consequently the rates of reactions are significantly lower, whereas the final levels of products are not significantly affected. Although Val-304 mutations produce various levels of ATPase inhibition, depending on the side-chain substitution, all mutations produce nearly total inhibition of Ca2+ transport (Table 1). We were particularly intrigued by the Val-304 → Glu mutant that retains 55% ATPase activity while sustaining no significant Ca2+ transport. We then found that Ca2+ occlusion by the fluoroaluminate analog of ADP·E1P·2Ca2+ (i.e. first intermediate following utilization of ATP) is defective in this mutant (Fig. 7). This defect is similar to that produced by Glu-309 and Asn-796 mutations. In fact, Glu-309 and Asn-796 are involved with their side chains in Ca2+ coordination at site II (9Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar), and the Glu-309 side chain sustains a specific gating function that is permissive for catalytic activation (12Inesi G. Ma H. Lewis D. Xu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31629-31637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For this reason the Glu-309 and Asn-796 mutants retain binding of one Ca2+ at site I, whereas the lack of Ca2+ at site II prevents ATPase activation. On the other hand, the Val-304 mutants retain significant ATPase activity, with a normal Ca2+ concentration dependence (Fig. 3). It is then apparent that the Val-304 side chain mutation to Glu (rather than affecting directly Ca2+ binding) hinders critical movements of transmembrane helices and engagement of Glu-309. Structural models illustrating the interference of Val-304 mutations with stabilization of the Glu-309 side chain are presented in Fig. 9. Because Glu-309 sustains a very important gating role in locking bound Ca2+ (12Inesi G. Ma H. Lewis D. Xu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31629-31637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the Val-304 → Glu mutation is sufficient to impair Ca2+ occlusion. Leak of occluded Ca2+ onto the outer medium, and reversal of the occluded state, would then interfere with the net rate of phosphoenzyme formation and with Ca2+ transport. In conclusion, we find that mutations of the well conserved Val-304 residue interfere with occlusion of bound Ca2+ upon utilization of ATP (31Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Wang G. Danko S. Iizuka H. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 39: 39197-39204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Einholm A.P. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15888-15896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This effect is attributed to altered constraint of the Glu-309 side chain and consequent defect of its gating function, resulting in reduction of the net rate of phosphoenzyme formation and inhibition of vectorial Ca2+ transport. In addition, phosphoenzyme turnover and overall ATPase activity are reduced by Val-304 mutations through interference with mechanical coupling and transmission of transmembrane segments movements to headpiece domains. Thereby, the kinetic effect of thermal activation energy is also reduced. G. I. is grateful to Dr. Francesco Tadini-Buoninsegni for attentive reading of the manuscript and helpful suggestions."
