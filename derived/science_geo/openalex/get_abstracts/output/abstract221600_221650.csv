https://openalex.org/W2059382687,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of approximately 22-nucleotide regulatory RNAs found in plants and animals. Some miRNAs of plants, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila play important gene-regulatory roles during development by pairing to target mRNAs to specify posttranscriptional repression of these messages. We identify three miRNAs that are specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells and show that their expression is dynamically regulated during early hematopoiesis and lineage commitment. One of these miRNAs, miR-181, was preferentially expressed in the B-lymphoid cells of mouse bone marrow, and its ectopic expression in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells led to an increased fraction of B-lineage cells in both tissue-culture differentiation assays and adult mice. Our results indicate that microRNAs are components of the molecular circuitry that controls mouse hematopoiesis and suggest that other microRNAs have similar regulatory roles during other facets of vertebrate development."
https://openalex.org/W2114701864,"Modern climate change is dominated by human influences, which are now large enough to exceed the bounds of natural variability. The main source of global climate change is human-induced changes in atmospheric composition. These perturbations primarily result from emissions associated with energy use, but on local and regional scales, urbanization and land use changes are also important. Although there has been progress in monitoring and understanding climate change, there remain many scientific, technical, and institutional impediments to precisely planning for, adapting to, and mitigating the effects of climate change. There is still considerable uncertainty about the rates of change that can be expected, but it is clear that these changes will be increasingly manifested in important and tangible ways, such as changes in extremes of temperature and precipitation, decreases in seasonal and perennial snow and ice extent, and sea level rise. Anthropogenic climate change is now likely to continue for many centuries. We are venturing into the unknown with climate, and its associated impacts could be quite disruptive."
https://openalex.org/W2081092282,"We have developed a method for temporal and regional gene expression targeting (TARGET) in Drosophila and show the simultaneous spatial and temporal rescue of a memory defect. The transient expression of the rutabaga -encoded adenylyl cyclase in the mushroom bodies of the adult brain was necessary and sufficient to rescue the rutabaga memory deficit, which rules out a developmental brain defect in the etiology of this deficit and demonstrates an acute role for rutabaga in memory formation in these neurons. The TARGET system offers general utility in simultaneously addressing issues of when and where gene products are required."
https://openalex.org/W1992410486,"The impact of global air pollution on climate and the environment is a new focus in atmospheric science. Intercontinental transport and hemispheric air pollution by ozone jeopardize agricultural and natural ecosystems worldwide and have a strong effect on climate. Aerosols, which are spread globally but have a strong regional imbalance, change global climate through their direct and indirect effects on radiative forcing. In the 1990s, nitrogen oxide emissions from Asia surpassed those from North America and Europe and should continue to exceed them for decades. International initiatives to mitigate global air pollution require participation from both developed and developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W2081839958,"We present tomographic evidence for the existence of deep-mantle thermal convection plumes. P-wave velocity images show at least six well-resolved plumes that extend into the lowermost mantle: Ascension, Azores, Canary, Easter, Samoa, and Tahiti. Other less well-resolved plumes, including Hawaii, may also reach the lowermost mantle. We also see several plumes that are mostly confined to the upper mantle, suggesting that convection may be partially separated into two depth regimes. All of the observed plumes have diameters of several hundred kilometers, indicating that plumes convey a substantial fraction of the internal heat escaping from Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2091214947,"Alpha-synuclein is implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, yet its functions remain obscure. When expressed in yeast, alpha-synuclein associated with the plasma membrane in a highly selective manner, before forming cytoplasmic inclusions through a concentration-dependent, nucleated process. Alpha-synuclein inhibited phospholipase D, induced lipid droplet accumulation, and affected vesicle trafficking. This readily manipulable system provides an opportunity to dissect the molecular pathways underlying normal alpha-synuclein biology and the pathogenic consequences of its misfolding."
https://openalex.org/W1997161422,"While functional brain imaging methods can locate the cortical regions subserving particular cognitive functions, the connectivity between the functional areas of the human brain remains poorly understood. Recently, investigators have proposed a method to image neural connectivity noninvasively using a magnetic resonance imaging method called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI measures the molecular diffusion of water along neural pathways. Accurate reconstruction of neural connectivity patterns from DTI has been hindered, however, by the inability of DTI to resolve more than a single axon direction within each imaging voxel. Here, we present a novel magnetic resonance imaging technique that can resolve multiple axon directions within a single voxel. The technique, called q-ball imaging, can resolve intravoxel white matter fiber crossing as well as white matter insertions into cortex. The ability of q-ball imaging to resolve complex intravoxel fiber architecture eliminates a key obstacle to mapping neural connectivity in the human brain noninvasively."

STKE (Connections Map, as seen November 2003), http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/cm/cmp_12069]. Now our challenge is to understand how the failure of these signals is associated with obesity and the progressive failure of pancreatic beta cells that leads to diabetes. Whether better management of chronic inflammation can improve insulin action is an important area of investigation. Drugs that stimulate IRS2 (insulin receptor substrate protein 2) synthesis or signaling might be a good starting point. This knowledge will lead to rational strategies that prevent or cure diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2149809624,"Extracellular ATP released from axons is known to assist activity-dependent signaling between neurons and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. Here we report that ATP released from astrocytes as a result of neuronal activity can also modulate central synaptic transmission. In cultures of hippocampal neurons, endogenously released ATP tonically suppresses glutamatergic synapses via presynaptic P2Y receptors, an effect that depends on the presence of cocultured astrocytes. Glutamate release accompanying neuronal activity also activates non-NMDA receptors of nearby astrocytes and triggers ATP release from these cells, which in turn causes homo- and heterosynaptic suppression. In CA1 pyramidal neurons of hippocampal slices, a similar synaptic suppression was also produced by adenosine, an immediate degradation product of ATP released by glial cells. Thus, neuron-glia crosstalk may participate in activity-dependent synaptic modulation."
https://openalex.org/W2112940666,"Destruction of existing tumor blood vessels may be achieved by targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling, which mediates not only endothelial cell proliferation but also endothelial cell survival. In this study, however, intravital microscopy failed to demonstrate that targeting of VEGFR-2 (by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU5416) induces significant regression of experimental tumor blood vessels. Immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, expression analyses, and in situ hybridization provide evidence that this resistance of tumor blood vessels to VEGFR-2 targeting is conferred by pericytes that stabilize blood vessels and provide endothelial cell survival signals via the Ang-1/Tie2 pathway. In contrast, targeting VEGFR-2 plus the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-beta system (PDGFR-beta) signaling (by SU6668) rapidly forced 40% of tumor blood vessels into regression, rendering these tumors hypoxic as shown by phosphorescence quenching. TUNEL staining, electron microscopy, and apoptosis blocking experiments suggest that VEGFR-2 plus PDGFR-beta targeting enforced tumor blood vessel regression by inducing endothelial cell apoptosis. We further show that this is achieved by an interference with pericyte-endothelial cell interaction. This study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of how 1) pericytes may provide escape strategies to anti-angiogenic therapies and 2) novel concepts that target not only endothelial cells but also pericyte-associated pathways involved in vascular stabilization and maturation exert potent anti-vascular effects."
https://openalex.org/W2063090066,"The Rho family of small guanosine triphosphatases regulates actin cytoskeleton dynamics that underlie cellular functions such as cell shape changes, migration, and polarity. We found that Smurf1, a HECT domain E3 ubiquitin ligase, regulated cell polarity and protrusive activity and was required to maintain the transformed morphology and motility of a tumor cell. Atypical protein kinase C zeta (PKCÎ¶), an effector of the Cdc42/Rac1-PAR6 polarity complex, recruited Smurf1 to cellular protrusions, where it controlled the local level of RhoA. Smurf1 thus links the polarity complex to degradation of RhoA in lamellipodia and filopodia to prevent RhoA signaling during dynamic membrane movements."
https://openalex.org/W2151034868,"Kinesin is a double-headed motor protein that moves along microtubules in 8-nanometer steps. Two broad classes of model have been invoked to explain kinesin movement: hand-over-hand and inchworm. In hand-over-hand models, the heads exchange leading and trailing roles with every step, whereas no such exchange is postulated for inchworm models, where one head always leads. By measuring the stepwise motion of individual enzymes, we find that some kinesin molecules exhibit a marked alternation in the dwell times between sequential steps, causing these motors to ""limp"" along the microtubule. Limping implies that kinesin molecules strictly alternate between two different conformations as they step, indicative of an asymmetric, hand-over-hand mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2013754033,"Genome-wide screens were performed in yeast to identify genes that enhance the toxicity of a mutant huntingtin fragment or of alpha-synuclein. Of 4850 haploid mutants containing deletions of nonessential genes, 52 were identified that were sensitive to a mutant huntingtin fragment, 86 that were sensitive to alpha-synuclein, and only one mutant that was sensitive to both. Genes that enhanced toxicity of the mutant huntingtin fragment clustered in the functionally related cellular processes of response to stress, protein folding, and ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism, whereas genes that modified alpha-synuclein toxicity clustered in the processes of lipid metabolism and vesicle-mediated transport. Genes with human orthologs were overrepresented in our screens, suggesting that we may have discovered conserved and nonoverlapping sets of cell-autonomous genes and pathways that are relevant to Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2172155383,"Humor plays an essential role in many facets of human life including psychological, social, and somatic functioning. Recently, neuroimaging has been applied to this critical human attribute, shedding light on the affective, cognitive, and motor networks involved in humor processing. To date, however, researchers have failed to demonstrate the subcortical correlates of the most fundamental feature of humor-reward. In an effort to elucidate the neurobiological substrate that subserves the reward components of humor, we undertook a high-field (3 Tesla) event-related functional MRI study. Here we demonstrate that humor modulates activity in several cortical regions, and we present new evidence that humor engages a network of subcortical regions including the nucleus accumbens, a key component of the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system. Further, the degree of humor intensity was positively correlated with BOLD signal intensity in these regions. Together, these findings offer new insight into the neural basis of salutary aspects of humor."
https://openalex.org/W2084852164,"Size determination represents a fundamental requirement for multicomponent biological structures. Some pathogenic bacteria possess a weapon derived from the flagellum. Like the flagellum, this type-III secretion apparatus, called the injectisome, has a transmembrane basal body, but the external component is a needle-like structure instead of a hook and a filament. Here, we provide evidence that the length of this needle is determined by the size of a protein, YscP, acting as a molecular ruler."
https://openalex.org/W2083269291,"Increased brain oxidative stress is a key feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and manifests predominantly as lipid peroxidation. However, clinical evidence that antioxidants can affect the clinical course of the disease is limited. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the antioxidant Vitamin E on the AD-like phenotype when given to a transgenic mouse model (Tg2576) of the disease before or after the amyloid plaques are deposited. One group of Tg2576 received Vitamin E starting at 5 months of age until they were 13 months old, the second group started at 14 months of age until they were 20 months old. Brain levels of 8,12-iso-iPF2alpha-VI, a specific marker of lipid peroxidation, were significantly reduced in both groups of mice receiving Vitamin E compared with placebo. Tg2576 administered with Vitamin E at a younger age showed a significant reduction in Abeta levels and amyloid deposition. By contrast, mice receiving the diet supplemented with Vitamin E at a later age did not show any significant difference in either marker when compared with placebo. These results support the hypothesis that oxidative stress is an important early event in AD pathogenesis, and antioxidant therapy may be beneficial only if given at this stage of the disease process."
https://openalex.org/W2089965591,"We characterized the entrance channel, reaction threshold, and mechanism of an excited-state H atom transfer reaction along a unidirectionally hydrogen-bonded âwireâ âOâHÂ·Â·Â·NH 3 Â·Â·Â·NH 3 Â·Â·Â·NH 3 Â·Â·Â·N. Excitation of supersonically cooled 7-hydroxyquinolineÂ·(NH 3 ) 3 to its vibrationless S 1 state produces no reaction, whereas excitation of ammonia-wire vibrations induces H atom transfer with a reaction threshold â 200 wave numbers. Further translocation steps along the wire produce the S 1 state 7-ketoquinolineÂ·(NH 3 ) 3 tautomer. Ab initio calculations show that proton and electron movement along the wire are closely coupled. The rate-controlling S 1 state barriers arise from crossings of a ÏÏ* with a Rydberg-type ÏÏ* state."
https://openalex.org/W2005815081,"Movement selection depends on the outcome of prior behavior. Posterior cingulate cortex (CGp) is strongly connected with both limbic and oculomotor circuitry, and CGp neurons respond following saccades, suggesting a role in signaling the motivational outcome of gaze shifts. To test this hypothesis, single CGp neurons were studied in monkeys while they shifted gaze to visual targets for liquid rewards that varied in size or were delivered probabilistically. CGp neurons responded following saccades as well as following reward delivery, and these responses were correlated with reward size. CGp neurons also responded following the omission of predicted rewards. The timing of CGp activation and its modulation by reward could provide signals useful for updating representations of expected saccade value."
https://openalex.org/W2122284893,"Hair cells in the vertebrate cochlea are arranged tonotopically with their characteristic frequency (CF), the sound frequency to which they are most sensitive, changing systematically with position. Single mechanotransducer channels of hair cells were characterized at different locations in the turtle cochlea. In 2.8 mM external Ca2+, the channel's chord conductance was 118 pS (range 80-163 pS), which nearly doubled (range 149-300 pS) on reducing Ca2+ to 50 microM. In both Ca2+ concentrations, the conductance was positively correlated with hair cell CF. Variation in channel conductance can largely explain the increases in size of the macroscopic transducer current and speed of adaptation with CF. It suggests diversity of transducer channel structure or environment along the cochlea that may be an important element of its tonotopic organization."
https://openalex.org/W2078186919,"Cell diversification in the developing nervous system is thought to involve both cell-intrinsic mechanisms and extracellular signals, but their relative importance in particular cell fate decisions remains uncertain. In the mammalian retina, different cell types develop on a predictable schedule from multipotent retinal neuroepithelial cells (RNECs). A current view is that RNECs pass through a series of competence states, progressively changing their responsiveness to instructive extracellular cues, which also change over time. We show here, however, that embryonic day 16â17 (E16â17) rat RNECs develop similarly in serum-free clonal-density cultures and in serum-containing retinal explantsâin the number of times they divide, the cell types they generate, and the order in which they generate these cell types. These surprising results suggest that extracellular signals may be less important than currently believed in determining when RNECs stop dividing and what cell types they generate when they withdraw from the cell cycle, at least from E16â17 onward."
https://openalex.org/W2102056068,"Platelet-collagen interactions play a fundamental role in the process of arterial thrombosis. The major platelet collagen receptor is the glycoprotein VI (GPVI). Here, we determined the effects of a soluble dimeric form of GPVI on platelet adhesion in vitro and in vivo. We fused the extracellular domain of GPVI with the human immunoglobulin Fc domain. The soluble dimeric form of GPVI (GPVI-Fc) specifically bound to immobilized collagen. Binding of GPVI-Fc to collagen was inhibited competitively by soluble GPVI-Fc, but not control Fc lacking the external GPVI domain. GPVI-Fc inhibited the adhesion of CHO cells that stably express human GPVI and of platelets on collagen and attenuated thrombus formation under shear conditions in vitro. To test the effects of GPVI-Fc in vivo, arterial thrombosis was induced in the mouse carotid artery, and platelet-vessel wall interactions were visualized by intravital fluorescence microscopy. Infusion of GPVI-Fc but not of control Fc virtually abolished stable arrest and aggregation of platelets following vascular injury. Importantly, GPVI-Fc but not control Fc, was detected at areas of vascular injury. These findings further substantiate the critical role of the collagen receptor GPVI in the initiation of thrombus formation at sites of vascular injury and identify soluble GPVI as a promising antithrombotic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2023357673,Water isotope ratios have been measured by laser absorption spectroscopy in and out of cirrus clouds formed in situ and convectively generated in anvils over subtropical regions. Water vapor in the tropical and subtropical upper troposphere shows a wide range of isotopic depletion not observed previously. The range suggests that dehydration of upper tropospheric air occurs both by convective dehydration and by gradual dehydration mechanisms. Twenty-five percent of upper tropospheric water sampled is in ice particles whose isotopic signatures are used to identify those grown in situ from those lofted from below.
https://openalex.org/W1977464233,"To understand the role of adaptation in speciation, one must characterize the ecologically relevant phenotypic effects of naturally occurring alleles at loci potentially causing reproductive isolation. The desaturase2 gene of Drosophila melanogaster is such a locus. Two geographically differentiated ds2 alleles underlie a pheromonal difference between the Zimbabwe and Cosmopolitan races. We used a site-directed gene replacement technique to introduce an allele of ds2 from the Zimbabwe population into Cosmopolitan flies. We show that the Cosmopolitan allele confers resistance to cold as well as susceptibility to starvation when the entire genetic background is otherwise identical. We conclude that ecological adaptation likely accompanies sexual isolation between the two behavioral races of D. melanogaster ."

The magnitude of this perturbation, known as the Yarkovsky effect, is a function of the asteroid's mass and surface thermal characteristics. Direct detection of the Yarkovsky effect on asteroids will help constrain their physical properties, such as bulk density, and refine their orbital paths. Based on the strength of the detected perturbation, we estimate the bulk density of Golevka to be 2.7(+0.4)(-0.6) grams per cubic centimeter."
https://openalex.org/W1993394859,"Whether contact of an axon with a dendrite is a necessary inductive signal for the assembly of functional presynaptic machinery is controversial. Combining FM1-43 imaging with retrospective immunocytochemistry, we observe many functional synaptic vesicle (SV) release sites lacking postsynaptic specializations in cultured hippocampal neurons. These âorphanâ release sites share the same exocytic machinery and mechanisms of endocytic recycling as mature synaptic sites. Moreover, quantitative analysis of FM1-43 destaining at these orphan release sites reveals similar kinetics with slightly lower release probabilities. Time-lapse imaging of FM1-43 reveals that orphans are generated by complete or partial mobilization of synaptic release sites that retain their functionality in transit. Orphan clusters fuse with existing synaptic release sites or form novel release sites onto dendrites. Mobilization and stabilization of orphan boutons to new sites of dendritic contact may represent a necessary presynaptic counterpart to postsynaptic changes observed during development and plasticity in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2159174417,"Rho family GTPases have been implicated in neuronal growth cone guidance; however, the underlying cytoskeletal mechanisms are unclear. We have used multimode fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) to directly address this problem. We report that actin arcs that form in the transition zone are incorporated into central actin bundles in the C domain. These actin structures are Rho/Rho Kinase (ROCK) effectors. Specifically, LPA mediates growth cone retraction by ROCK-dependent increases in actin arc and central actin bundle contractility and stability. In addition, these treatments had marked effects on MT organization as a consequence of strong MT-actin arc interactions. In contrast, LPA or constitutively active Rho had no effect on P domain retrograde actin flow or filopodium bundle number. This study reveals a novel mechanism for domain-specific spatial control of actin-based motility in the growth cone with implications for understanding chemorepellant growth cone responses and nerve regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2032897530,"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by a CUGn expansion (n approximately 50 to 5000) in the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA of the DM protein kinase gene. We show that mutant RNA binds and sequesters transcription factors (TFs), with up to 90% depletion of selected TFs from active chromatin. Diverse genes are consequently reduced in expression, including the ion transporter CIC-1, which has been implicated in myotonia. When TF specificity protein 1 (Sp1) was overexpressed in DM1-affected cells, low levels of messenger RNA for CIC-1 were restored to normal. Transcription factor leaching from chromatin by mutant RNA provides a potentially unifying pathomechanistic explanation for this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2112689110,"Antimicrobial drug action is limited by both microbial and host cell membranes. Microbes stringently exclude the entry of most drugs, and mammalian membranes limit drug distribution and access to intracellular pathogens. Recently, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been developed as carriers to improve mammalian cell uptake. Given that CPPs are cationic and often amphipathic, similar to membrane active antimicrobial peptides, it may be possible to use CPP activity to improve drug delivery to microbes. Here, two CPPs, TP10 and pVEC, were found to enter a range of bacteria and fungi. The uptake route involves rapid surface accumulation within minutes followed by cell entry. TP10 inhibited Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus growth, and pVEC inhibited Mycobacterium smegmatis growth at low micromolar doses, below the levels that harmed human HeLa cells. Therefore, although TP10 and pVEC entered all cell types tested, they preferentially damage microbes, and this effect was sufficient to clear HeLa cell cultures from noninvasive S. aureus infection. Also, conversion of the cytotoxicity indicator dye SYTOX Green showed that TP10 causes rapid and lethal permeabilization of S. aureus and pVEC permeabilizes M. smegmatis, but not HeLa cells. Therefore, TP10 and pVEC can enter both mammalian and microbial cells and preferentially permeabilize and kill microbes."

The fossil has striking similarity to the extant myodocopid family Cylindroleberididae, to which it is assigned, and demonstrates remarkable evolutionary stasis over 425 million years. The fossil is identified as a male on the basis of its copulatory organ."
https://openalex.org/W2053397644,"In vitro studies have indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the oxidation of signaling molecules are important mediators of signal transduction. We have identified two pathways by which the altered redox chemistry of the clk-1 mutants of Caenorhabditis elegans acts in vivo on germline development. One pathway depends on the oxidation of an analog of vertebrate low density lipoprotein (LDL) and acts on the germline through the Ack-related tyrosine kinase (ARK-1) kinase and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) signaling. The other pathway is the oncogenic ras signaling pathway, whose action on germline as well as vulval development appears to be modulated by cytoplasmic ROS."
https://openalex.org/W2017819318,"Thymosin beta4, a 43-amino acid polypeptide that is an important mediator of cell migration and differentiation, also promotes angiogenesis and wound healing. Here, we report that thymosin beta4 stimulates hair growth in normal rats and mice. A specific subset of hair follicular keratinocytes in mouse skin expresses thymosin beta4 in a highly coordinated manner during the hair growth cycle. These keratinocytes originate in the hair follicle bulge region, a niche for skin stem cells. Rat vibrissa follicle clonogenic keratinocytes, closely related, if not identical, to the bulge-residing stem cells, were isolated and their migration and differentiation increased in the presence of nanomolar concentrations of thymosin beta4. Expression and secretion of the extracellular matrix-degrading enzyme matrix metalloproteinase-2 were increased by thymosin beta4. Thus, thymosin beta4 accelerates hair growth, in part, due to its effect on critical events in the active phase of the hair follicle cycle, including promoting the migration of stem cells and their immediate progeny to the base of the follicle, differentiation, and extracellular matrix remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2064529965,"According to the present paradigm, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1alpha,25-(OH)2D3] is a biologically active hormone; whereas 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3) is regarded as a prohormone activated through the action of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1alpha-hydroxylase (1alpha-hydroxylase). Although the role of vitamin D3 in the regulation of growth and differentiation of prostatic epithelial cells has been well studied, its action and metabolism in prostatic stroma are still largely unknown. We investigated the effects of 25OHD3 and 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 on two human stromal primary cultures termed P29SN and P32S. In a cell proliferation assay, 25OHD3 was found at physiological concentrations of 100-250 nM to inhibit the growth of both primary cultures, whereas 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 at a pharmacological concentration of 10 nM exhibited the growth-inhibitory effects on P29SN cells but not on P32S cells. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that both 25OHD3 and 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 induced 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 24-hydroxylase (24-hydroxylase) mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner. By inhibiting 1alpha-hydroxylase and/or 24-hydroxylase enzyme activities, the induction of 24-hydroxylase mRNA by 250 nM 25OHD3 was clearly enhanced, suggesting that 1alpha-hydroxylation is not a prerequisite for the hormonal activity of 25OHD3. Altogether our results suggest that 25OHD3 at a high but physiological concentration acts as an active hormone with respect to vitamin D3 responsive gene regulation and suppression of cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2140096680,"Liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) has been proposed to limit the availability of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) for oxidation and for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha), a fatty acid binding transcription factor that determines the capacity of hepatic fatty acid oxidation. Here, we used L-FABP null mice to test this hypothesis. Under fasting conditions, this mutation reduced beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) plasma levels as well as BHB release and palmitic acid oxidation by isolated hepatocytes. However, the capacity for ketogenesis was not reduced: BHB plasma levels were restored by octanoate injection; BHB production and palmitic acid oxidation were normal in liver homogenates; and hepatic expression of key PPAR-alpha target (MCAD, mitochondrial HMG CoA synthase, ACO, CYP4A3) and other (CPT1, LCAD) genes of mitochondrial and extramitochondrial LCFA oxidation and ketogenesis remained at wild-type levels. During standard diet, mitochondrial HMG CoA synthase mRNA was selectively reduced in L-FABP null liver. These results suggest that under fasting conditions, hepatic L-FABP contributes to hepatic LCFA oxidation and ketogenesis by a nontranscriptional mechanism, whereas L-FABP can activate ketogenic gene expression in fed mice. Thus, the mechanisms whereby L-FABP affects fatty acid oxidation may vary with physiological condition."
https://openalex.org/W1974190675,"Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) have been shown to mediate remyelination and to stimulate axonal regeneration in a number of in vivo rodent spinal cord studies. However, whether OECs display similar properties in the primate model has not been tested so far. In the present study, we thus transplanted highly-purified OECs isolated from transgenic pigs expressing the alpha1,2 fucosyltransferase gene (H-transferase or HT) gene into a demyelinated lesion of the African green monkey spinal cord. Four weeks posttransplantation, robust remyelination was found in 62.5% of the lesion sites, whereas there was virtually no remyelination in the nontransplanted controls. This together with the immunohistochemical demonstration of the grafted cells within the lesioned area confirmed that remyelination was indeed achieved by OECs. Additional in vitro assays demonstrated 1) that the applied cell suspension consisted of >98% OECs, 2) that the majority of the cells expressed the transgene, and 3) that expression of the HT gene reduced complement activation more than twofold compared with the nontransgenic control. This is the first demonstration that xenotransplantation of characterized OECs into the primate spinal cord results in remyelination."
https://openalex.org/W1527965920,"CXCR3 binding chemokine CXCL10 (IP-10) markedly enhances antigen-specific Th1 recall responses in healthy humans, suggesting a role for this pathway in maintenance of clinical tolerance to environmental allergens as well as a potential therapeutic role for CXCR3 ligands in re-balancing the Th2-dominated responses that underlie generation and maintenance of allergic disorders. Here, we investigated the capacity of CXCR3 ligands to modulate allergen-driven IFNgamma production by healthy and allergic individuals characterized by Th1 and Th2 immunity-dominated allergen specific responses, respectively. Exogenous CXCR3 ligands up-regulated antigen-dependent IFNgamma production from healthy individuals' peripheral blood mononuclear cells up to 120-fold, a response neutralized by anti-CXCR3 treatment and not emulated by CCR5 ligands. In contrast, allergic individuals were strikingly hypo-responsive to CXCR3 ligands (P=0.0004). Chemokine-enhanced IFNgamma production correlated with T cell CXCR3 expression (r=0.736, P=0.0001) in vivo and was independent of Th2 cytokine levels. These findings demonstrate that CXCR3-ligation preferentially augments ongoing Th1 over Th2 responses and suggest that reduced capacity of allergic individuals to respond to CXCR3 ligands promotes the maintenance of human allergic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2078506965,"In the heart, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a pro-hypertrophic and anti-apoptotic peptide. In cultured rat cardiomyocytes, IGF-1 induced a fast and transient increase in Ca2+i levels apparent both in the nucleus and cytosol, releasing this ion from intracellular stores through an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent signaling pathway. Intracellular IP3 levels increased after IGF-1 stimulation in both the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. A different spatial distribution of IP3 receptor isoforms in cardiomyocytes was found. Ryanodine did not prevent the IGF-1-induced increase of Ca2+i levels but inhibited the basal and spontaneous Ca2+i oscillations observed when cardiac myocytes were incubated in Ca2+-containing resting media. Spatial analysis of fluorescence images of IGF-1-stimulated cardiomyocytes incubated in Ca2+-containing resting media showed an early increase in Ca2+i, initially localized in the nucleus. Calcium imaging suggested that part of the Ca2+ released by stimulation with IGF-1 was initially contained in the perinuclear region. The IGF-1-induced increase on Ca2+i levels was prevented by 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,Nâ²,Nâ²-tetraacetic acid-AM, thapsigargin, xestospongin C, 2-aminoethoxy diphenyl borate, U-73122, pertussis toxin, and Î²ARKct (a peptide inhibitor of GÎ²Î³ signaling). Pertussis toxin also prevented the IGF-1-dependent IP3 mass increase. Genistein treatment largely decreased the IGF-1-induced changes in both Ca2+i and IP3. LY29402 (but not PD98059) also prevented the IGF-1-dependent Ca2+i increase. Both pertussis toxin and U73122 prevented the IGF-1-dependent induction of both ERKs and protein kinase B. We conclude that IGF-1 increases Ca2+i levels in cultured cardiac myocytes through a GÎ²Î³ subunit of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-PI3K-phospholipase C signaling pathway that involves participation of IP3. In the heart, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a pro-hypertrophic and anti-apoptotic peptide. In cultured rat cardiomyocytes, IGF-1 induced a fast and transient increase in Ca2+i levels apparent both in the nucleus and cytosol, releasing this ion from intracellular stores through an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent signaling pathway. Intracellular IP3 levels increased after IGF-1 stimulation in both the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. A different spatial distribution of IP3 receptor isoforms in cardiomyocytes was found. Ryanodine did not prevent the IGF-1-induced increase of Ca2+i levels but inhibited the basal and spontaneous Ca2+i oscillations observed when cardiac myocytes were incubated in Ca2+-containing resting media. Spatial analysis of fluorescence images of IGF-1-stimulated cardiomyocytes incubated in Ca2+-containing resting media showed an early increase in Ca2+i, initially localized in the nucleus. Calcium imaging suggested that part of the Ca2+ released by stimulation with IGF-1 was initially contained in the perinuclear region. The IGF-1-induced increase on Ca2+i levels was prevented by 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,Nâ²,Nâ²-tetraacetic acid-AM, thapsigargin, xestospongin C, 2-aminoethoxy diphenyl borate, U-73122, pertussis toxin, and Î²ARKct (a peptide inhibitor of GÎ²Î³ signaling). Pertussis toxin also prevented the IGF-1-dependent IP3 mass increase. Genistein treatment largely decreased the IGF-1-induced changes in both Ca2+i and IP3. LY29402 (but not PD98059) also prevented the IGF-1-dependent Ca2+i increase. Both pertussis toxin and U73122 prevented the IGF-1-dependent induction of both ERKs and protein kinase B. We conclude that IGF-1 increases Ca2+i levels in cultured cardiac myocytes through a GÎ²Î³ subunit of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-PI3K-phospholipase C signaling pathway that involves participation of IP3.

Yakar S. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4436-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). IGF-1 and its receptor (IGF-1R) are present in rat heart, consistent with IGF-1 regulating growth and hypertrophy in the developing heart in an autocrine or paracrine manner (2Engelmann G.L. Boehm K.D. Haskell J.F. Khairallah P.A. Ilan J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1989; 63: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). IGF-1 induces cardiac hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo (3Ito H.

Circulation. 2000; 101: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). IGF-1R, which is closely related to the insulin receptor, is a protein-tyrosine kinase composed of two heterodimers linked by disulfide bonds (10Ward C.W. Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M. Cosgrove L.J. Sparrow L.G. Frenkel M.J. Hoyne P.A. Elleman T.C. Adams T.E. Lovrecz G.O. Lawrence L.J. Tulloch P.A. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Following IGF-1 binding, IGF-1R becomes autophosphorylated on several tyrosine residues, allowing its interaction with phosphotyrosine binding or Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins, thereby transducing signals to downstream effectors (11Dupont J. LeRoith D. Horm. Res. 2001; 55: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Through these effectors, IGF-1 activates two main signaling cascades, the Ras-Rafmitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) pathways (12Petley T. Graff K. Jiang W. Yang H. Florini J. Horm. Metab. Res. 1999; 31: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have demonstrated that IGF-1R also activates heterotrimeric G proteins in some cell types. Luttrell et al. (13Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16495-16498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) first demonstrated in rat-1 fibroblasts that treatment with pertussis toxin (PTX) or transfection with a GÎ²Î³ scavenger (Î²ARK-CT) blocked IGF-1-induced ERK activation (13Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T.

This study suggested the involvement of the GÎ²Î³ subunit of a PTX-sensitive G protein in the activation of ERK (13Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Ross B.N. Rubin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2255-2258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Conflicting observations on the roles of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) in IGF-1 signaling have been reported. In BALB/c 3T3 cells, IGF-1 stimulates Ca2+ influx via IGF-1R by activating a Ca2+-permeable cation channel (17Kojima I. Matsunaga H. Kurokawa K. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16561-16567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting Ca2+ influx produces oscillations in the concentration of free intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) independently of phosphoinositide turnover (18Kojima I. Mogami H. Ogata E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: E307-E311PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in cultured bovine alveolar macrophages, nanomolar concentrations of IGF-1 stimulate after 30 s the accumulation of IP3 and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate, and induce a rise in [Ca2+]i (19Geertz R. Kiess W. Kessler U. Hoeflich A. Tarnok A. Gercken G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 177: 33-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In chondrocytes, IGF-1 induces Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, which is partially blocked by phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitors and PTX (20Poiraudeau S. Lieberherr M. Kergosie N. Corvol M.T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Short term exposure of neurons and neuronal cell lines to IGF-1 leads to direct activation of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels (21Selinfreund R.H. Blair L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1215-1220PubMed Google Scholar, 22Blair L.A. Marshall J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 421-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 23Kleppisch T. Klinz F.J. Hescheler J. Brain Res. 1992; 591: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whereas in rat pinealocytes IGF-1 inhibits L-type currents (24Chik C.L. Li B. Karpinski E. Ho A.K. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2033-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). IGF-1 also modulates L-type Ca2+ channels in adult rat cardiac myocytes and in skeletal muscle of young and middle-aged rats, but not of aged rats (25Renganathan M. Sonntag W.E. Delbono O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Solem M.L. Thomas A.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In whole heart and in ferret papillary muscle, IGF-1 displays an acute positive inotropic effect, which is secondary to augmented myofilament responsiveness to Ca2+ (27Cittadini A. Ishiguro Y. StroÌmer H. Spindler M. Moses A.C. Clark R. Douglas P.S. Ingwall J.S. Morgan J.P. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In rat ventricular papillary muscle cells, however, acute exposure to IGF-1 or insulin results in enhanced muscle contractility that is associated with [Ca2+]i transients (28Freestone N.S. Ribaric S. Mason W.T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 163â164: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes, IGF-1 activates multiple signaling pathways, including ERK-PKC, PKB/PI3K, PLC-Î³, and JAK-STAT (9Fujio Y. Nguyen T. Wencker D. Kitsis R.N. Walsh K. Circulation. 2000; 101: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 29Foncea R. Andersson M. Ketterman A. Blakesley V. Sapag-Hagar M. Sugden P.H. LeRoith D. Lavandero S. J. Biol.

Kodama H. Sano M. Makino S. Kato T. Manabe T. Ogawa S. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 884-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the role of cytosolic Ca2+ as the second messenger in the complex IGF-1 signaling pathways present in cardiac myocytes has not been examined. In the present study we show that, both in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+, addition of IGF-1 to cultured cardiac myocytes induced a rapid [Ca2+] increase in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and also produced a rapid increase of IP3 levels. The presence of extracellular Ca2+ modified the kinetics of the [Ca2+] increase, delaying an increase of cytosolic but not nuclear [Ca2+]. The role of tyrosine kinase, G-protein, PI3K, PLC, and the IP3 receptor in the pathway leading to these calcium signals was established using specific inhibitors. Materialsâ[3H]IP3 was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Fluo3-acetoxymethyl ester (Fluo3-AM) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Thapsigargin, xestospongin C, genistein, BAPTA-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), LY294002 (LY), PD98059 (PD), and SB203580 (SB) were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (San Diego, CA). 2-Aminoethoxy diphenyl borate was from Aldrich. Polyclonal antibodies against type 1 and type 2 IP3 receptor were from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Antitype 3 IP3 receptor was kindly donated by G. A. Mignery (Loyola University, Chicago, IL). Polyclonal antibodies against phosphorylated (Ser473) PKB, total PKB, phosphorylated (Thr202/Thr204) ERK, and total ERK were from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, medium 199, U-73122, ryanodine, nifedipine, PTX, IP3, and other biochemicals were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Human recombinant IGF-1 was donated by Dr. C. George-Nascimento (Austral Biologicals, San Ramon, CA). AnimalsâRats were bred in the Animal Breeding Facility from the Faculty of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Chile (Santiago, Chile). We performed all studies with the approval of the institutional bioethical committee at the Faculty of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Chile, Santiago. This investigation conforms to the âGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animalsâ published by the United States National Institutes of Health (31United States National Institutes of HealthGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. National Institutes of Health Publication 85-23, 1985Google Scholar). Culture of Cardiac MyocytesâCardiac myocytes were prepared from hearts of 1â3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (29Foncea R. Andersson M. Ketterman A. Blakesley V. Sapag-Hagar M. Sugden P.H. LeRoith D. Lavandero S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19115-19124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For IP3 determination, cardiomyocytes were plated at a final density of 0.7 Ã 103/mm2 on gelatin-precoated 60-mm dishes. For detection of Ca2+, cells were plated with a final density of 1.0 Ã 103/mm2 on gelatin-precoated coverslips. Serum was withdrawn for 24 h before the cells were treated further with agonist IGF-1 (1â100 nm) in serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/medium 199) at 37 Â°C. Cultured cardiomyocytes, assessed with an anti-Î²-myosin heavy chain antibody, were at least 95% pure. Recombinant AdenovirusesâAdenoviral vectors (Ad) were propagated and purified as previously described (33Shah A.S. White D.C. Emani S. Kypson A.P. Lilly R.E. Wilson K. Glower D.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Circulation. 2001; 103: 1311-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Two transgenes (a gift from Dr. W. J. Koch, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC) were used: Î²ARKct (Ad-Î²ARKct) and an empty viral construct (Ad-EV). Î²ARKct is a peptide inhibitor of GÎ²Î³ signaling (34Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiomyocytes were infected with adenoviral vectors at a multiplicity of infection of 300. Determination of IP3 MassâCardiomyocytes were rinsed and preincubated for 20 min at room temperature in 58 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 60 mm LiCl, 10 mm glucose, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Cells were stimulated by fast (1 s) replacement of this solution by a solution containing IGF-1. At the times indicated, the reaction was stopped by rapid aspiration of the stimulating solution, addition of 0.8 m ice-cold perchloric acid and freezing with liquid nitrogen. Samples were allowed to thaw and cell debris was spun down for protein determination. The supernatant was neutralized with a solution of 2 m KOH, 0.1 m MES, and 15 mm EDTA. The neutralized extracts were frozen at â80 Â°C until required for IP3 determination. Measurements of IP3 mass were made by radioreceptor assay (35Liberona J.L. Powell J.A. Shenoi S. Petherbridge L. Caviedes R. Jaimovich E. Muscle Nerve. 1998; 21: 902-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, a crude rat cerebellum membrane preparation was obtained after homogenization of tissue in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, containing 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol and centrifugation at 20,000 Ã g for 15 min. This procedure was repeated 3 times, suspending the final pellet in the same solution plus 0.3 m sucrose and freezing it at â80 Â°C until required for use. The rat cerebellar membrane preparation was calibrated for IP3 binding with 1.6 nm [3H]IP3 and 2â120 nm cold IP3, with sample analysis performed in a similar way but replacing cold IP3 with a portion of the neutralized supernatant. [3H]IP3 radioactivity, which remained bound to membranes, was measured in a Beckman LS-6000TA liquid scintillation spectrometer (Beckman Instruments Corp., Fullerton, CA). Protein was determined by the Lowry method (36Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of Intracellular CalciumâCellular calcium images were obtained from neonatal cardiac myocytes preloaded with Fluo3-AM, using an inverted confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Axiovert 135 M-LSM Microsystems) or a fluorescence microscope (Olympus Diaphot-TMD, Nikon Corporation) equipped with a cooled CCD camera and image acquisition system (Spectra Source MCD 600). Cardiac myocytes were washed three times with Ca2+-containing resting media (Krebs buffer: 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES-Na, 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.4) to remove Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/medium 199 culture medium, and loaded with 5.4 Î¼m Fluo3-AM (coming from a stock in 20% pluronic acid, Me2SO) for 30 min at room temperature. After loading, cardiac myocytes were washed either with the same buffer or with a Ca2+-free resting media (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.0 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2,10mm HEPES-Na, 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and used within 2 h. The cell-containing coverslips were mounted in a 1-ml capacity plastic chamber and placed in the microscope for fluorescence measurements after excitation with a 488-nm wavelength argon laser beam or filter system. IGF-1 was either added directly or the solution was fast (1 s) changed in the chamber. The fluorescent images were collected every 0.4â2.0 s for fast signals and analyzed frame by frame with the image data acquisition program (Spectra-Source) of the equipment. An objective lens PlanApo 60X (numerical aperture 1.4) was generally used. In most of the acquisitions, the image dimension was 512 Ã 120 pixels. Intracellular calcium was expressed as a percentage of fluorescence intensity relative to basal fluorescence (a value stable for at least 5 min in resting conditions). The fluorescence intensity increase is proportional to the rise in [Ca2+]i (37Minta A. Kao J.P. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8171-8178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digital Image ProcessingâElimination of out-of-focus fluorescence was performed using both the âno neighborsâ deconvolution algorithm and Castleman's (38Castleman K. Digital Image Processing. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1989Google Scholar) point spread function theoretical model, as described previously (39Estrada M. Liberona J.L. Miranda M. Jaimovich E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E132-E139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For quantitation of fluorescence, the summed pixel intensity was calculated from the section delimited by a contour. As a way of increasing efficiency of these data manipulations, action sequences were generated. To avoid interference in the fluorescence by possible IGF-1 effects on the cellular volume, the area of each fluorescent cell was determined by image analysis using adaptive contour and then creating a binary mask, which was compared with its bright-field image. Western Blot AnalysisâCell lysates were matched for proteins (10â40 Î¼g) and were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (pH 7.6) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) for 60 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted 1/1,000 in blocking solution. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 Â°C. After washing in TBST (3Ã 10 min each), the blots were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (1:5,000 in 1% (w/v) nonfat milk powder in TBST). The blots were washed again in TBST and the bands were detected using ECL with exposure to Kodak film for 0.5â30 min. Blots were quantified by scanning densitometry. Subcellular FractionationâNuclear and cytosolic fractions from cultured cardiac myocytes were prepared as described by Schreiber et al. (40Schreiber E. Matthias P. MuÌller M. Schaffer W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6413-6422Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Homogeneity of fractions were assessed by Western blot using Î±-actinin (marker for myofibril Z bands) (41Hilenski L.L. Terracio L. Borg T.K. Cell Tissue Res. 1991; 264: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), lamina-associated polypeptide 2 (marker for nuclear inner membrane) (42Vlcek S. Dechat T. Foisner R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1758-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and calsequestrin (marker for sarcoplasmic reticulum) (43Yano K. Zarain-Herzberg A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). ImmunocytochemistryâCardiomyocytes grown on coverslips were fixed in iced methanol, blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min, and incubated with primary anti-IP3 receptor antibodies at 4 Â°C overnight. The cells were then washed 5-fold with phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin and incubated with the appropriate goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three more times, the coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). The samples were evaluated in a scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Axiovert 135, LSM Microsystems) and documented through computerized images (44Estrada M. Cardenas C. Liberona J.L.

Expression of Results and Statistical AnalysisâData are represented as mean Â± S.E. of the number of independent experiments indicated (n) or as examples of representative experiments performed on at least three separate occasions. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance and comparisons between groups were performed using a protected Tukey's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was set as the limit of statistical significance. IGF-1-induced Intracellular Ca2+Transients in Rat Cardiac MyocytesâChanges in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, were visualized in single cardiomyocytes preloaded with Fluo3-AM. Increases of relative fluorescence represent an increase of free cytosolic [Ca2+]. Multiple region of interest (ROI) analysis of single cells revealed that similar kinetics and fluorescence intensities were detected disregarding the analyzed ROI window (data not shown). Quiescent cardiomyocytes, maintained in Ca2+-containing resting solution, exhibited basal [Ca2+]i oscillations that were blocked by 30 min preincubation with ryanodine (50 Î¼m) (data not shown). Incubation of cardiomyocytes in resting solution without Ca2+ also prevented [Ca2+]i oscillations (data not shown). Addition of IGF-1 (1 nm) to cardiomyocytes maintained in Ca2+-free resting solution induced a fast and transient (10â20 s) increase in [Ca2+]i, with a maximum at 4â5 s after IGF-1 addition (Fig. 1, A and B). The lowest concentration of IGF-1 that induced [Ca2+]i transients was 0.01 nm. When cardiomyocytes were maintained in Ca2+-containing resting solution, addition of IGF-1 induced a similar, although slower increase of [Ca2+]i, reaching a maximum 40â50 s after IGF-1 addition (Fig. 1C). Cardiomyocytes maintained in Ca2+-containing resting solution usually showed basal [Ca2+]i oscillations; these oscillations were not altered by addition of IGF-1. Following IGF-1 addition in Ca2+-free resting solution, an increase of [Ca2+]i was observed both in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). Analysis of ROI in the fluorescence images showed that both nuclear and cytosolic Ca2+ transient time courses were similar in IGF-1-stimulated cardiomyocytes maintained in the Ca2+-free resting solution (Fig. 1D). However, when cardiomyocytes were treated with IGF-1 in Ca2+-containing resting solution, nuclear [Ca2+] increased faster than cytosolic [Ca2+] (Fig. 1E). ROI analysis clearly showed that extracellular Ca2+ slowed down the cytosolic but not the nuclear increase in [Ca2+] stimulated by IGF-1 (Fig. 1, D and E). Rates of rise of the nuclear Ca2+ transients in the presence and absence of external Ca2+ were 32.3 Â± 7.6 and 38.6 Â± 8.1 (Îf/f per s) (n = 4), respectively. However, rates of rise of Ca2+ transients in the cytosol were 3.9 Â± 1.4 and 20.1 Â± 5.3 (Îf/f per s) (n = 10), respectively. In all cells studied, the IGF-1-induced increase in [Ca2+] did not trigger regenerative waves through the cytosol. IGF-1-induced Ca2+Release from Ryanodine and Nifedipine-insensitive Intracellular StoresâThe increase in [Ca2+]i in cardiomyocytes upon stimulation with IGF-1 in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ suggests involvement of Ca2+ release from internal stores. Resting Fluo3-AM preloaded cardiomyocytes usually displayed increased basal fluorescence in the perinuclear region (Fig. 2, A and B). After addition of IGF-1, the distribution of fluorescence changed and the increase in fluorescence was homogeneous in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2B, 2 s and 10 s). These observations suggest that IGF-1 induced Ca2+ release from perinuclear Ca2+ stores. IGF-1-induced Ca2+ transients in cardiomyocytes maintained in Ca2+-free resting media were not suppressed by ryanodine (Fig. 3B). However, ROI analysis of nuclear and cytosolic fluorescence revealed that in the presence of ryanodine the increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] was slower than in the nucleus (Fig. 3D). Cardiomyocytes incubated in Ca2+-containing resting solution displayed an analogous behavior. These results suggest that the IGF-1 stimulated fast increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ was partly because of calcium release through ryanodine receptors because a fast component was inhibited after preincubation with 20 Î¼m ryanodine. Nifedipine did not modify IGF-1-induced Ca2+ transients in cardiomyocytes maintained in Ca2+-free resting solution (Fig. 3C). ROI analysis of images revealed that both nuclear and cytosolic fluorescence increases presented similar kinetics in the presence or absence of nifedipine (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels are not involved in the IGF-1-induced Ca2+ transients in cardiomyocytes. To further demonstrate the role of intracellular Ca2+ stores in the generation of IGF-1-induced Ca2+ transients, cardiomyocytes were preloaded with both BAPTA-AM and Fluo3-AM, and then stimulated with 1 nm IGF-1. BAPTA-AM inhibited the increase of fluorescence induced by IGF-1 and only a small decrease in fluorescence was apparent in these conditions (Fig. 4A). Treatment of Fluo3-AM-preloaded cardiomyocytes with thapsigargin, a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, led to a slow increase of intracellular fluorescence because of Ca2+ loss from internal stores. Subsequent addition of IGF-1 (5 min) to these cells did not induce the characteristic increase in the fluorescence signal (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained when internal Ca2+ stores where depleted using caffeine, a ryanodine receptor activator (Fig. 4C). When thapsigargin-pretreated cardiomyocytes were incubated with caffeine, no additional Ca2+ release was detected (Fig. 4D). Further treatment with IGF-1 did not increase fluorescence, an effect obtained by the addition of external Ca2+ (Fig. 4D). This Ca2+ influx elicited by calcium add back suggests the activation of a plasma membrane store-operated channel activity in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. However, external Ca2+ addition to cardiac myocytes after IGF-1 treatment sh"

We investigated the potential interaction between sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in the Akt signaling pathway. Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from S1P receptor knockout mice, we show here that S1P3 was required for S473 phosphorylation of Akt by S1P. In addition, S1P-stimulated activation of Akt, but not ERK, was blocked by a PDGF receptor (PDGFR)-specific inhibitor, AG1296, suggesting a S1P3-mediated specific crosstalk between the Akt signaling pathways of S1P and PDGFR in MEFs. We investigated this crosstalk under different conditions and found that both Akt and ERK activation induced by S1P, but not lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), in HEY ovarian cancer cells required PDGFR but not epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGFR). Importantly, S1P induced a Gi-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFR in HEY cells. This dependence on PDGFR in S1P-induced Akt activation was also observed in A2780, T47D, and HMEC-1 cells (which express S1P3), but not in PC-3 or GI-101A cells (which do not express S1P3), further supporting that S1P3 mediates the crosstalk between S1P and PDGFR. This is the first report demonstrating a unique interaction between S1P3 and PDGFR, in addition to demonstrating a specific role for S1P3 in S1P-induced Akt activation."
https://openalex.org/W2160866228,"Hypoxia induces angiogenesis, partly through stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), leading to transcription of pro-angiogenic factors. Here we examined the regulation of HIF-1alpha by hypoxia and nitric oxide (NO) in explants of human cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells. Cells were treated with NO donors under normoxic or hypoxic (2% O2) conditions, followed by analysis of HIF-1alpha protein levels. Treatment with the NO donor sodium nitroprusside reduced levels of HIF-1alpha, whereas NO donors, NOC-18 and S-nitrosoglutathione, increased HIF-1alpha levels. SIN-1, which releases both NO and superoxide (O2*-), reduced HIF-1alpha levels, suggesting that inhibitory NO donors may elicit effects through peroxynitrite (ONOO*-). O2*- generation by xanthine/xanthine oxidase also reduced HIF-1alpha levels, confirming an inhibitory role for reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, superoxide dismutase increased HIF-1alpha levels, and the NO scavenger carboxy-PTIO reversed HIF-1alpha stabilization by NO donors. Effects on HIF-1alpha levels correlated with vascular endothelial growth factor transcription but did not affect HIF-1alpha transcription, as measured by RT-PCR and luciferase-reporter assays. The results indicate that HIF-1alpha is stabilized by agents that produce NO and reduce ROS but destabilized by agents that increase ROS, including O2*- and ONOO*-. Thus we propose that the effect of NO on HIF-1alpha signaling is critically dependent on the form of NO and the physiological environment of the responding cell."
https://openalex.org/W2146112995,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and semaphorin-3A (Sema-3A) play important roles in the transduction of promitotic and antimitotic signals, respectively. Here, we report that these conflicting signals are integrated via negative feedback between VEGF and Sema-3A pathways in several primary normal, but not malignant, mesothelial cells. Unlike malignant mesothelial (MM) cells, in which VEGF induces cell proliferation, normal mesothelial (NM) cell growth was repressed by VEGF. Although both cell-types expressed an overlapping set of VEGF tyrosine-kinase receptors, only in NM cells VEGF exposure entails a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent increased of Sema-3A production. Inhibition of p38 MAPK (by SB202190 and SB203580) or a dominant-negative mutant of Sema-3A receptor plexin-A1 reversed the inhibitory effects of VEGF in NM cells, increasing cyclin D1 synthesis and cell growth. Conversely, sustained activation of p38 MAPK by the p38 MAPK-activating kinases MKK3 and MKK6 or transfection with Sema-3A inhibited VEGF-induced cyclin D1 up-regulation and MM cell proliferation. Therefore, these results delineate a new role of Sema-3A in VEGF function mediated by p38 MAPK and suggest that the abrogation of regulated Sema-3A expression is responsible for VEGF-driven growth of tumor cells."

This observatory includes a vertical seismic profiling (VSP) array. VSP seismograms from nearby microearthquakes contain signals between the P and S waves. These signals may be P and S waves scattered by the local geologic structure. The collected scattering points form planar surfaces that we interpret as the San Andreas fault and four other secondary faults. The scattering process includes conversions between P and S waves, the strengths of which suggest large contrasts in material properties, possibly indicating the presence of cracks or fluids."
https://openalex.org/W2161707555,"We evaluated the effects of fasting on the gene expression profile in rat gastrocnemius muscle using a combined cDNA array and RT-PCR approach. Of the 1176 distinct rat genes analyzed on the cDNA array, 114 were up-regulated more than twofold in response to fasting, including all 17 genes related to lipid metabolism present on the membranes and all 10 analyzed components of the proteasome machinery. Only 7 genes were down-regulated more than twofold. On the basis of our analysis of genes on the cDNA array plus the data from our RT-PCR assays, the metabolic adaptations shown by rat gastrocnemius muscle during fasting are reflected by i) increased transcription both of myosin heavy chain (MHC) Ib (associated with type I fibers) and of at least three factors involved in the shift toward type I fibers [p27kip1, muscle LIM protein (MLP), cystein rich protein-2], of which one (MLP) has been shown to enhance the activity of MyoD, which would explain the known increase in the expression of skeletal muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3); ii) increased lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression, known to trigger UCP3 transcription, which tends, together with the first point, to underline the suggested role of UCP3 in mitochondrial lipid handling (the variations under the first point and this one have not been observed in mice, indicating a species-specific regulation of these mechanisms); iii) reduced expression of the muscle-specific coenzyme Q (CoQ)7 gene, which is necessary for mitochondrial CoQ synthesis, together with an increased expression of mitochondrial adenylate kinase 3, which inactivates the resident key enzyme for CoQ synthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR), the mRNA level for which fell during fasting; and iv) increased transcription of components of the proteasomal pathways involved in protein degradation/turnover."

This experimental paradigm exposes a potent inhibitory process, present in nervous systems from invertebrates to humans, that is widely considered to play an important role in reducing distraction during the processing of sensory input. The neural mechanisms mediating PPI are of considerable interest given evidence linking PPI deficits with some of the cognitive disorders of schizophrenia. Here, in the marine mollusk Tritonia diomedea, we describe a detailed cellular mechanism for PPIâa combination of presynaptic inhibition of startle afferent neurons together with distributed postsynaptic inhibition of several downstream interneuronal sites in the startle circuit."
https://openalex.org/W2098380546,"The synthetic immunomodulator AS101[ammonium trichloro(dioxoethylene-o,o')tellurate] was previously found to protect cancer patients from chemotherapy-induced bone marrow toxicity and alopecia. Here we show that AS101 induces hair growth in nude and normal mice. AS101 possesses the dual ability to both induce anagen and retard spontaneous catagen in the C57BL/6 mouse model. Anagen induced by AS101 is mediated by keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), as it is abrogated both in nude mice co-treated with AS101 plus neutralizing anti KGF antibodies and in AS101-treated transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative KGF receptor transgene in basal keratinocytes. AS101 up-regulates KGF expression by activating the ras signaling pathway in cultured fibroblasts. AS101-induced delayed catagen is associated with inhibition of terminal differentiation marker expression both in nude and C57BL/6 mice epidermal follicular keratinocytes and in cultures of primary mouse follicular keratinocytes induced to differentiate. This activity is associated with relatively sustained elevation of p21waf. Delayed expression of terminal differentiation markers was not induced by AS101 in follicular keratinocytes from p21waf knockout mice. Because similar results were obtained with cultures of primary human keratinocytes and fibroblasts, preliminary case report studies revealed substantial hair growth when AS101 was topically applied on three adolescents who had remained alopeciac 1-2 years after chemotherapy. The results emphasize the unique mode of action of AS101 and highlight its potential clinical use for treating certain types of alopecia."
https://openalex.org/W1603276636,"The ubiquitous environmental pollutants polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are responsible for important carcinogenic and apoptotic effects, whose mechanisms are still poorly understood, owing to the multiplicity of possible cellular targets. Among these mechanisms, alterations of ionic homeostasis have been suggested. In this work, the effects of benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P] on pHi were tested in the rat liver F258 epithelial cell line, using the fluoroprobe carboxy-SNARF-1. After a 48-h treatment, B(a)P (50 nM) induced an alkalinization, followed by an acidification after 72 h and the development of apoptosis. Determinations of pH(i) recovery following an acid load showed an increased acid efflux at 48 h. Cariporide inhibited both the early alkalinization and the increased acid efflux, thus suggesting the involvement of Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1). Besides, alpha-naphtoflavone (alpha-NF), an inhibitor of CYP1A1-mediated B(a)P metabolism, prevented all pH(i) changes, and NHE1 activation was blocked by the antioxidant thiourea, which inhibited CYP1A1 metabolism-dependent H2O2 production. Regarding B(a)P-induced apoptosis, this was prevented by alpha-NF and bongkrekic acid, an inhibitor of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Interestingly, apoptosis was significantly reduced by cariporide. Taken together, our results indicate that B(a)P, via H2O2 produced by CYP1A1-dependent metabolism, induces an early activation of NHE1, resulting in alkalinization; this appears to play a significant role in mitochondria-dependent B(a)P-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2166474806,"The ABri and ADan amyloid peptides deposited in familial British and Danish neurodegenerative disorders are generated by processing mutant forms of the precursor protein BRI2. Although the pathogenic process that leads to deposition of amyloid in the brains of patients has been studied extensively, the cellular processes and normal function of the precursor protein did not receive much attention. We observed in a variety of transfected cell lines the presence of two independent proteolytic processing events. In addition to the previously described cleavage, which results in the production of carboxyl-terminal approximately 3 kDa wild-type peptide or approximately 4 kDa ABri or ADan peptides, we describe a novel amino-terminal cleavage site within BRI2. Both cleavages occur within the cis- or medial-Golgi. Following cleavage, the BRI2-derived carboxyl-terminal peptides are transported via a regulated secretory pathway into secretory vesicles in neuronal cells. Worth noting is that expression of wild-type British or Danish mutants of BRI2, in mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells that do not express endogenous BRI2, induces elongation of neurites, which suggests a role for this protein in differentiation of neuronal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2018164908,"Calphostin-C, a protein kinase C inhibitor, induces apoptosis of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the mechanisms are not completely defined. Because apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells is critical in several proliferating vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and restenosis after angioplasty, we decided to investigate the mechanisms underlying the calphostin-C-induced apoptotic pathway. We show here that apoptosis is inhibited by the addition of exogenous phosphatidic acid, a metabolite of phospholipase D (PLD), and that calphostin-C inhibits completely the activities of both isoforms of PLD, PLD1 and PLD2. Overexpression of either PLD1 or PLD2 prevented the vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal but not the calphostin-C-elicited apoptosis. These data suggest that PLDs have anti-apoptotic effects and that complete inhibition of PLD activity by calphostin-C induces smooth muscle cell apoptosis. We also report that calphostin-C induced microtubule disruption and that the addition of exogenous phosphatidic acid inhibits calphostin-C effects on microtubules, suggesting a role for PLD in stabilizing the microtubule network. Overexpressing PLD2 in Chinese hamster ovary cells phenocopies this result, providing strong support for the hypothesis. Finally, taxol, a microtubule stabilizer, not only inhibited the calphostin-C-induced microtubule disruption but also inhibited apoptosis.

We wished to investigate the apoptosis of VSMCs in vitro and its underlying mechanisms. It is known that calphostin-C, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, induces apoptosis in VSMCs and in several other cell systems (3Ikemoto H. Tani E. Matsumoto T. Nakano A. Furuyama J. J.

However, the underlying mechanisms for calphostin-C-induced apoptosis of VSMCs are not completely defined, although pathways involving the activation of calpain, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 may be involved (4Spinedi A.

It is well known that in the reaction catalyzed by the PLDs, PLD1 and PLD2 produce phosphatidic acid (PA) from phosphatidylcholine and PA is a key signaling molecule that can trigger various cellular functions (13Frohman M.A. Sung T.C.

Taken together, these studies suggest that PA may regulate the function and/or structure of the cytoskeleton. To our knowledge, however, it is not known whether PA regulates the assembly or disassembly of microtubules in mammalian cells. It is conceivable that a complete removal of PA in cells could interrupt the integrity of the cytoskeleton, e.g. the microtubule network. We have recently found that microtubule disruption using nocodazole induces apoptosis of VSMCs with some similar features to those cells treated with calphostin-C, which promoted us to examine the effects of calphostin-C on the microtubule network. In this report, we show that calphostin-C induces apoptosis of VSMCs through its inhibition of PLD followed by microtubule disruption.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and ReagentsâCalphostin-C and GF 109203X were obtained from Calbiochem. Monoclonal antibodies for Î±-tubulin, phosphatidic acid, and propidium iodide (PI) were purchased from Sigma. RPMI 1640 medium and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen.Cell Culture and TreatmentâPrimary culture of VSMCs was carried out using the explant method as described previously (20Chamley-Campbell J. Campbell G.R. Ross R. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 1-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). The blood vessel tissues were derived from thoracic aorta of male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g). The medial aortic tissue was cut into small pieces (1 mm3), which were then placed on the plastic surface of culture dishes. The tissue explants were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 Î¼g/ml). The culture was carried out at 37 Â°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% C02 and 95% air. Cells were usually observed to migrate from tissues between days 4 and 7 after explanting. The islets of outgrowing cells were then treated with 0.25% trypsin and 0.25 mm EDTA solution (Invitrogen) followed by subculture. The cells from passage 6-8 were used for the experiments described. Calphostin-C was dissolved in water and added to culture medium directly to achieve a final concentration of 0.2 Î¼m for 24 h. To test the effects of PA on calphostin-C-induced apoptosis, PA micelles (1 Î¼g/ml) were added to culture medium 30 min before calphostin-C. In serum starvation experiments, cells were cultured in medium containing 0.5% serum for 2 days before any treatment. CHO cells were cultured using Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum essentially like VSMCs. These cells harbored either hemagglutinin-PLD2 or hemagglutinin-PLD2 K758R under control of a tetracycline-inducible T-Rex (Invitrogen). Expression of PLD2 or PLD2K758R was induced by adding 1 Î¼g/ml doxycycline (Dox) for 20 h.Apoptosis and DNA Analysis Using Laser-scanning Cytometry (LSC)âVSMCs were cultured on acid-washed coverslips. After various treatments, cells were fixed with 80% ethanol for 20 min and cold 100% ethanol for another 20 min. After rinsing with PBS (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), cells were incubated with a solution containing 5 mg/ml PI and 200 ng/ml RNase for 20 min. Coverslips were mounted to microscopic slides. DNA analysis and apoptosis of VSMCs in response to calphostin-C were performed with LSC (CompuCyte, Cambridge, MA) as previously described (21Kamentsky L.A. Kamentsky L.D. Cytometry. 1991; 12: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 22Kamentsky L.A. Burger D.E. Gershman R.J. Kamentsky L.D. Luther E. Acta Cytol. 1997; 41: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Data were acquired and analyzed with WinCyte acquisition software (version 3.4, CompuCyte). Apoptosis of cultured VSMCs was indicated by the appearance of a sub-G0/G1 apoptotic peak. The apoptotic cells in the sub-G0/G1 peak were confirmed using relocation of LSC to observe cells directly through the CCD camera.DNA Fragmentation AssayâAfter treatment with or without 0.2 Î¼m or 1 Î¼m calphostin-C for 24 h, cells were collected and solubilized by vigorous vortexing in TE9S buffer (0.5 m EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9), 1% (w/v) SDS) containing proteinase K (1 mg/ml). This was followed by a 3-h incubation at 50 Â°C and DNA extraction using phenol-chloroform. After incubation with RNase A (l mg/ml) for 1 h at 20-22 Â°C, DNA samples were analyzed using conventional electrophoresis in 1.5% (w/v) agarose gels. The gels were visualized using a gel documentation system (Bio-Rad).GFP-PLD Expression Vector construction and the Establishment of Stably Transfected CellsâThe construction of pCGN-PLDlb (GenBankâ¢ accession number U38545), pCGN-PLD1-K898R (inactive allele), pCGN-PLD2 (GenBankâ¢ accession number U87557), and pCGN-PLD2-K758R (inactive allele) was performed as described previously (23Sung T.C.

To avoid changing the reading frames, PLD1b and PLD2 were cloned into pEGFP-C2 and pEGFP-C3 vectors, respectively (Clontech Laboratories). PLDlb and PLD1-K898R were excised from pCGN-PLDlb and pCGN-PLD1-K898R with HapI and SmaI. PLD2 and PLD2-K758R were excised from pCGN-PLD2 and pCGN-PLD2-K758R with XbaI and Smal. Both pEGFP-C2 and pEGFP-C3 were digested using SmaI. Excised cDNA fragments were purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The sizes of the excised fragments were confirmed by gel electrophoresis. After construction, restriction mapping confirmed the presence and orientation of the PLD1b and PLD2 cDNAs in the vector.Cells were transiently transfected with each DNA preparation using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Successful transfection was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. To make stable cells, transfected cells were selected by adding 400 ng/ml G418 into the culture medium. After forming single colonies in the presence of G418, all of the cells were pooled to make a stable cell mixture and these cells were maintained in 100 ng/ml G418, which was withdrawn 1 week before setting up the experiments. The expression of PLDs in stably transfected cells was confirmed using both immunoprecipitation/Western blot and a PLD activity assay.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis of GFP and PLD-GFP ExpressionâStably transfected cells after 24-h serum starvation were lyzed for protein extraction. An equal amount of protein (100 Î¼g) from each sample was added to 1 ml of PBS followed by an overnight incubation with antibody for GFP and protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 Â°C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed using standard SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred (30 V, overnight, 4 Â°C) from the gels to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with anti-GFP mouse monoclonal antibody to detect both GFP and PLD-GFPs. A horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody. Visualization of signals was achieved by using chemiluminescence (ECL reagent, Amersham Biosciences).PLD Activity AssayâCultured cells were maintained in cell starvation medium (0.5% serum) for 3 days and then labeled with l Î¼Ci/ml [9,10(n)-3H]myristic acid (Amersham Biosciences, catalog number TRK90) for 12 h. Cells were then washed three times with PBS, pH 7.4, and pre-equilibrated at 37 Â°C in cell starvation medium for 60 min. Butanol (0.5%) was included during the last 10 min of incubation. After termination of the reaction, cells were collected followed by lipid extraction and separation with 0.6 ml of methnol/chloroform/0.1 n HCl (v/v/v, 1:1:1). A fraction of the extracted lipids was measured for total radioactivity using a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman). Samples were subsequently separated on a silica gel TCL sheet. After autoradiography, the spots corresponding to the reference lipid (phosphatidylbutanol) were scraped to scintillation vials for the measurement of radioactivity. The activities of PLDs were presented as a ratio of radioactivity for each spot to the total radioactivity.Immunocytochemical StudiesâCells cultured on coverslips were treated with or without calphostin-C for 48 h. These cells were then rinsed with PBS and fixed with 80% ethanol for 20 min. Cells were subsequently permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS. After incubation with bovine serum albumin (0.5%) containing PBS for 20 min, cells on coverslips were incubated with a primary antibody to target the protein of interest, washed with PBS, and incubated with Alexa Flour-488 labeled secondary antibodies. Cell nuclei were counterstained with a PI solution (5 Î¼g/ml) that contained RNase (200 ng/ml). Cellular fluorescent signals were detected using either regular fluorescence microscopy or LSC. CHO cells after induction of PLD2 and PLD2 K758R with Dox (1 Î¼g/ml) for 20 h were fixed with cold methanol followed by staining for Î±-tubulin and overexpressed PLD2.Data AnalysisâData are expressed as the mean Â± S.E. The number of replicate (n) represents the number of cell samples used in the studies. Differences between means were evaluated by the Student's t test (paired or independent) when two groups were compared and by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni's correction when three or more groups were compared. p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 was considered significant. All statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (SPSS, version 10, Chicago, IL).RESULTSSmooth Muscle Cell Apoptosis Induced by Calphostin-CâWe had observed that there was significant cell death with a slight rounding up of cultured rat VSMCs in response to treatment with calphostin-C (0.2 Î¼m) but not GF109203X (3 Î¼m) (data not shown). It has been reported that calphostin-C induces apoptosis in several cell systems including VSMCs in culture. Therefore, we wished to confirm this calphostin-C induced apoptosis in cultured rat aortic VSMCs. To do so, we extracted DNA from cells with or without treatment with calphostin-C (0.2 or 1 Î¼m) for 24 h. The DNA samples were analyzed using agarose gels as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Our results showed that calphostin-C at 0.2 Î¼m induced significant DNA fragmentation, and the fragmentation was even more prominent at a concentration of 1 Î¼m (Fig. 1, panel A). Typical apoptotic nuclei in response to calphostin-C treatment were observed directly with fluorescent microscopy after PI staining (Fig. 1, panels B and C). We further analyzed VSMC apoptosis induced by calphostin-C with LSC, a microscope-based cytometer. As shown in Fig. 1, panels D and E, we observed the typical sub-G0/G1 apoptotic peak in the DNA histograms. Cells in the apoptotic peak were then located using LSC relocation to confirm their apoptotic morphologies as shown in the insert of Fig. 1, panel E. Accumulated data showed that apoptotic cell number (percentage of total cells) significantly increased in response to treatment with calphostin-C (0.2 Î¼m). The apoptosis in VSMCs induced by calphostin-C appeared independent of its PKC inhibition, because inhibition of PKC by GF109203X did not induce an apoptotic response (data not shown). Recently, calphostin-C has been reported to directly inhibit the activities of PLD independent of its inactivation of PKC (8Sciorra V.A. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2640-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Given that PLD has anti-apoptotic effects in some cell systems, we hypothesized that inhibition of PLD could contribute to the apoptotic action of calphostin-C. Therefore, we explored the following two sets of experiments to test this possibility.Inhibition of PLD Activities by Calphostin-CâTo test the involvement of PLDs in calphostin-C induced apoptosis, we first examined whether calphostin-C inhibits PLD activities in cultured rat aortic VSMCs. To do so, we labeled the lipid pool with [9,10(n)-3H]myristic acid and used butanol for transphosphatidylation to measure PLD activities of cells cultured with or without the presence of calphostin-C at 0.2 Î¼m for 24 h. As expected, calphostin-C treatment completely inhibited the activity of PLDs in cells cultured with 10% serum (Fig. 2). Therefore, this observation has confirmed that calphostin-C is a potent PLD inhibitor in VSMCs. Also, it suggests that PLD inhibition may be the mechanism through which calphostin-C induces apoptosis in VSMCs. To further test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of exogenous phosphatidic acid on calphostin-C-induced apoptosis.Fig. 2Inhibition of PLD activity by calphostin-C. The PLD activities in VSMCs cultured in medium containing 10% serum are represented by the formation of phosphatidylbutanol as described under âExperimental Procedures.â The y axis indicates the total PLD activity as a percentage of that in control cells without any treatment. Results are presented as mean Â± S.E. (n = 4). The PLD activity of control cells is set as 100. The x axis indicates different groups with various treatments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PA Inhibits Calphostin-C-induced ApoptosisâCultured VSMCs were incubated with phosphatidic acid micelles (1 Î¼g/ml) 30 min before treatment with calphostin-C (0.2 Î¼m) for 24 h. As anticipated, the results showed that treatment of cells with PA prevented the appearance of the sub-G0/G1 apoptotic peak induced by calphostin-C as shown in the DNA histograms acquired using LSC (Fig. 3). This inhibition of apoptosis by PA was confirmed using the DNA fragmentation assay (data not shown). These data, along with the results that show PLD inhibition by calphostin-C, strongly suggested that calphostin-C induced apoptosis of cultured VSMCs through its inhibition of PLDs. However, we wished to establish further that PLD activation in cultured VSMCs indeed has an anti-apoptotic effect.Fig. 3Exogenous PA inhibits calphostin-C-induced apoptosis of VSMCs. Cells were cultured on coverslips without or with the presence of calphostin-C (panels A and B) for 24 h followed by analysis using LSC. Cells in panel C were pretreated with PA (1 Î¼g/ml) before the addition of calphostin-C (0.2 Î¼m). The y axis (Count) shows the number of scanned cells, and the x axis (PI Integral) shows the total DNA in each cell. Cells in region 1 are considered to be apoptotic cells. Panel D is a bar figure for accumulated data in which the y axis is the percentage of apoptotic cells in each condition derived from LSC. The x axis indicates the different groups. The asterisk indicates a significant difference (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Overexpression of Either PLD1b or PLD2 in Cultured VSMCs Inhibits Apoptosis Induced by Serum StarvationâIn our preliminary studies, we observed that serum withdrawal induced apoptosis of cultured rat aortic VSMCs as described by others (25Aoki M. Morishita R. Matsushita H. Nakano N. Hayashi S. Tomita N. Yamamoto K. Moriguchi A. Higaki J. Ogihara T. Heart Vessels. 1997; 12 (suppl.): 71-75PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that cultured cells have low PLD activities in the absence of serum (26Carnero A. Cuadrado A. Del Peso L. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1387-1395PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of exogenous PA prevented the apoptosis of cultured VSMCs, resulting from serum starvation for 3 days (Fig. 4, panel A). Therefore, we hypothesized that overexpression of either PLD1b or PLD2 would prevent apoptosis resulting from serum withdrawal. To test this possibility, we established stably transfected cells harboring PLD1b, PLD2, or their inactive forms (see âExperimental Proceduresâ). The expression of PLD-GFP fusion proteins was first confirmed by observing the bright fluorescence in transiently transfected cells (data not shown). Cells were then selected with G418 (400 ng/ml) for 2 weeks. The expression of PLD-GFP fusion proteins in stably transfected cells was further confirmed using immunoprecipitation/Western blot to detect the presence of GFP as shown in Fig. 4, panel B. As anticipated, our data showed that control cells harboring only GFP undergo significant apoptosis after 3 days of culture in serum-free medium as analyzed using LSC (Fig. 4, panels C and H). However, there was no significant apoptosis observed in cells expressing either PLD1b or PLD2 and the rescue is clearly activity-dependent because expression of the inactive forms of PLD1b and PLD2 did not inhibit apoptosis. This activity dependence was further confirmed by measuring PLD activity in the presence and absence of 10% serum. As shown in Fig. 4, panel I, serum withdrawal for 3 days significantly reduced PLD activity in the GFP control cells. In contrast, stably transfected cells harboring PLD1b or PLD2, but not their inactive forms, displayed significantly higher activities than the control cells in the presence or absence of serum. Therefore, these findings demonstrate that both PLD1b and PLD2 have anti-apoptotic effects in cultured VSMCs. Taken together, we conclude that the PLDs have anti-apoptotic effects and that calphostin-C induces apoptosis through its inhibition of PLD. However, we wished to further examine the mechanisms underlying calphostin-C-induced apoptosis. As mentioned earlier, we observed the rounding up of cells in response to calphostin-C treatment. This cell response is similar to what we observed in response to microtubule-disruptive agents such as nocodazole, which also induces VSMC apoptosis. Therefore, we explored whether there was a relationship between PLD and the cytoskeleton.Fig. 4Overexpression of PLD1b and PLD2 inhibits apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal. Serum starvation-induced apoptosis was prevented by the presence of PA (panel A). Cells on coverslips were cultured in serum-free medium without (control) and with (+PA) the presence of PA (1 Î¼g/ml) for 3 days followed by analysis of apoptotic cells using LSC as described under âExperimental Procedures.â The asterisk indicates a significant difference compared with control cells in the absence of serum for 3 days (p < 0.01, n = 4). Panel B, stably transfected cells harboring pEGFP-PLD1b, pEGFP-PLD1b-K898R, pEGFP-PLD2, and pEGFP-PLD2-K758R were characterized using immunoprecipitation/Western blot. Cells after serum starvation for 24 h were lyzed for protein extraction, and 100-Î¼g protein from each population was analyzed with immunoprecipitation/Western blot using an anti-GFP antibody. In panel B, lane 1, cells transfected with the GFP construct; lanes 2 and 3, cells harboring pEGFP-PLD1b and pEGFP-PLD1b-K898R respectively; and lanes 4 and 5, cells harboring pEGFP-PLD2 and pEGFP-PLD2-K758R. To evaluate apoptosis, all of the cells were maintained in serum-free medium for 3 days followed by analysis of apoptosis using LSC. Panels C-G, DNA histograms derived from LSC in which the y axis (Count) shows the number of scanned cells and the x axis (PI Integral) shows the total DNA in each cell. Cells in region 1 are apoptotic cells contributing to the sub-G0/G1 peak. Panel C is from control cells with pEGFP alone. Panels D and E are from cells harboring pEGFP-PLD1b and pEGFP-PLD1b-K898R. Panels F and G are data from cells harboring pEGFP-PLD2 and pEGFP-PLD2-K758R. Panel H is a bar figure for accumulated data to show apoptotic cell number. The y axis is apoptotic cells (percentage of total cells scanned). The x axis indicates the different groups. The asterisk indicates a significant difference (p < 0.01; n = 6). Panel I shows the total PLD activities (percentage of control, the y axis) in various stable cells as indicated in the x axis with and without the presence of 10% serum for 3 days. The asterisk indicates a significant difference compared with the GFP control cells in the presence of serum (p < 0.05, n = 4). The double asterisk shows a significant difference compared with the GFP control cells in the absence of serum for 3 days (p < 0.05; n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Calphostin-C Induction of Microtubule Disruption and Effects of PA and TaxolâTo address whether calphostin-C modulates the microtubule network, we first examined microtubules via immunostaining for Î±-tubulin. As expected, calphostin-C treatment induced significant disruption of microtubules (Fig. 5, panel B). Importantly, the addition of exogenous PA prevented the disruption of microtubules and the morphologic changes (Fig. 5, panel C). As expected, a microtubule stabilizer, taxol (0.01 Î¼m) (27Axel D.I.

In the rat testis, the most conspicuous dying cells are pachytene spermatocytes, which are also the primary target of the apoptosis experimentally induced by methoxyacetic acid (MAA). In this paper, we have used clusterin expression as an indicator of germ cell apoptosis in rat seminiferous tubules treated with MAA in the presence or in the absence of voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCCs) inhibitors. We performed both a qualitative analysis of clusterin expression by immunofluorescence experiments and a quantitative analysis of apoptosis by in situ end labeling of apoptotic germ cells followed by flow cytometry. The results obtained demonstrate that Sertoli cells, the somatic component of the seminiferous epithelium, which control male germ cell differentiation, also modulate MAA-induced apoptosis of germ cells throughout voltage-operated calcium channels."
