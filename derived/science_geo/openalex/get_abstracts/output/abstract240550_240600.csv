Here, we report that the distant mammalian Sir2 homolog SIRT6 is a broadly expressed, predominantly nuclear protein. Northern analysis of embryonic samples and multiple adult tissues revealed mouse SIRT6 (mSIRT6) mRNA peaks at day E11, persisting into adulthood in all eight tissues examined. At the protein level, mSIRT6 was readily detectable in the same eight tissue types, with the highest levels in muscle, brain, and heart. Subcellular localization studies using both C- and N-terminal green fluorescent protein fusion proteins showed mSIRT6-green fluorescent protein to be a predominantly nuclear protein. Indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies to two different mSIRT6 epitopes confirmed that endogenous mSIRT6 is also largely nuclear. Consistent with previous findings, we did not observe any NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase activity in preparations of mSIRT6. However, purified recombinant mSIRT6 did catalyze the robust transfer of radiolabel from [32P]NAD to mSIRT6. Two highly conserved residues within the catalytic core of the protein were required for this reaction. This reaction is most likely mono-ADP-ribosylation because only the modified form of the protein was recognized by an antibody specific to mono-ADP-ribose. Surprisingly, we observed that the catalytic mechanism of this reaction is intra-molecular, with individual molecules of mSIRT6 directing their own modification. These results provide the first characterization of a Sir2 protein from phylogenetic class IV.

These results provide the first characterization of a Sir2 protein from phylogenetic class IV. Members of the Sir2 family of enzymes, conserved from bacteria to man, utilize oxidized NAD+ as a cosubstrate in the deacetylation of a wide variety of proteins, thereby regulating diverse processes including aging, genomic silencing, recombination, cell fate, and metabolism (1Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). In yeast, the archetypal Sir2p localizes to chromatin sites at the telomeres, ribosomal DNA, and silent mating type loci, facilitating genomic silencing through the deacetylation of lysines within the histone H3 and H4 tails (2Gasser S.M. Cockell M.M. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 279: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In this context, yeast Sir2p promotes mother cell longevity by repressing ribosomal DNA recombination and formation of toxic extra-chromosomal ribosomal DNA circles (3Hekimi S. Guarente L. Science. 2003; 299: 1351-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 4Bitterman K.J. Medvedik O. Sinclair D.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 376-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Sir2p extends yeast life span (5Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar), and Sir2p activity increases in response to caloric restriction (6Lin S.J. Ford E. Haigis M. Liszt G. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), contributing to the resultant extension of life span (7Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, Sir2 orthologs in worm and fly also promote longevity, although probably by different molecular mechanisms (8Rogina B. Helfand S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15998-16003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar, 9Wood J.G. Rogina B. Lavu S. Howitz K. Helfand S.L. Tatar M. Sinclair D.

Mammalian genomes contain seven Sir2 homologs, termed sirtuins (SIRTs). Of these, SIRT1, orthologous to the yeast Sir2, is the best characterized and has the broadest substrate specificity (11North B.J. Verdin E. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 224Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). A nuclear protein, SIRT1 deacetylates several substrates in vivo, including MyoD, p53, and FOXO transcription factors, thereby affecting cell differentiation and survival under stress (11North B.J. Verdin E. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 224Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 12Motta M.C. Divecha N. Lemieux M. Kamel C. Chen D. Gu W. Bultsma Y. McBurney M. Guarente L.

Recently, mouse SIRT1 was reported to inhibit the mobilization of fatty acids in white adipose tissue by repressing PPARγ, linking Sir2 proteins to the physiology of caloric restriction in mammals (14Picard F. Kurtev M. Chung N. Topark-Ngarm A. Senawong T. Machado De Oliveira R. Leid M. McBurney M.W. Guarente L. Nature. 2004; 429: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). Of the remaining SIRTs (SIRT2–7), an in vivo substrate has only been identified for the cytoplasmic SIRT2 (15North B.J. Marshall B.L. Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 437-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). This substrate, β-tubulin, is specifically deacetylated by SIRT2 (15North B.J. Marshall B.L. Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 437-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar), although the biological consequences of this reaction are unclear. Yeast Sir2 and its orthologs, including mouse SIRT1 and bacterial CobB, catalyze the tightly coupled cleavage of NAD+ and protein deacetylation, producing nicotinamide and 2-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose reaction products (16Sauve A.A. Schramm V.L. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Whereas Sir2 proteins are generally thought to be NAD-dependent protein deacetylases, most also display a less robust mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity in vitro (17Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 18Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2001; 98: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Mutations in phylogenetically conserved residues within the catalytic core of Sir2 and SIRT1 have failed to separate the two enzymatic activities (21Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Imai S.I. Guarente L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The initial observation that ADP-ribosylation by Sir2 is stronger on acetylated substrates (22Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2774) Google Scholar), combined with subsequent mechanistic studies (18Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 20Tanny J.C. Moazed D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), has led to the conclusion that the deacetylase and phosphoribosyltransferase activities of Sir2 proteins are coupled (16Sauve A.A. Schramm V.L. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Using sequence similarity, eukaryotic Sir2 genes have been divided into four broad phylogenetic classes (23Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar), known as classes I–IV (Fig. 1). SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT3 are class I, SIRT4 is class II, and SIRT5 falls within the predominantly prokaryotic class III. Finally, mammalian SIRT6 and SIRT7 are class IV sirtuins (23Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). In vitro studies indicate that human SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3, and SIRT5 possess NAD-dependent histone deacetylase activity (15North B.J. Marshall B.L. Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 437-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar), whereas SIRT4, SIRT6, and SIRT7 fail to deacetylate 3H-labeled acetylated histone H4 peptide (15North B.J. Marshall B.L. Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 437-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). The lack of detectable deacetylase activity in these SIRTs may result from their specificity for targets other than those tested, or it may indicate an enzymatic activity other than deacetylation inherent in these sirtuins. Mono-ADP-ribosylation is emerging as a common mechanism of reversible protein modification within mammalian cells. Originally described as the acting mechanism for specific bacterial toxins, ADP-ribosylation is typically performed by separate families of intra- and extracellular enzymes in vertebrates (24Corda D. Di Girolamo M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1953-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Known targets of the intracellular class of enzymes include molecular chaperone GRP78/BiP, translational elongation factor 2, and β-subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins (24Corda D. Di Girolamo M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1953-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Extracellular mammalian ADP-ribosyltransferases, generally found in cells of the immune system, modify substrates important for the immune response, as well as integrin α7 and the antimicrobial peptide defensin (24Corda D. Di Girolamo M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1953-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In most known cases, ADP-ribosylation of arginine residues results in reversible inactivation of the substrate protein (25Riese M.J. Goehring U.M. Ehrmantraut M.E. Moss J. Barbieri J.T. Aktories K. Schmidt G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12082-12088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), although this modification may enhance certain enzymatic functions within the substrate (26Weng B. Thompson W.C. Kim H.J. Levine R.L. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31797-31803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this report, we characterize the tissue-specific expression, subcellular localization, and in vitro enzymatic activity of mouse SIRT6. This investigation, the first detailed study of a class IV sirtuin, reveals mouse SIRT6 to be a widely expressed, predominantly nuclear protein with a robust auto-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Multiple Sequence Alignments—Sequences of mouse proteins SIRT1, SIRT4, SIRT5, and SIRT6, as well as yeast Sir2p, were obtained from the Proteome BioKnowledge® Library (proteome.incyte.com/control/tools/proteome). Core domains were aligned by ClustalW using software from the DNASTAR package. Plasmid Construction—IMAGE clone 1259892, which contains the mouse SIRT6 cDNA, was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The mSIRT6 1The abbreviations used are: mSIRT6, mouse SIRT6; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyindole; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase. coding sequence was amplified by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-N1 and the BglII and EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C2, creating pmSIRT6-EGFP and pEGFP-mSIRT6, respectively. Similarly, the mSIRT6 coding sequence was amplified by PCR and cloned into the NheI and BamHI sites of pET28a (Novagen) and pET-GST (a gift from Robert Marciniak) creating pET28a-His6-SIRT6 and pET-GST-SIRT6. pET28a-His6-mSIRT6-S56A and pET28a-His6-SIRT6-H133Y were created using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. PET-GST-SIRT6-(274–355) was created by amplifying the portion of the mSIRT6 cDNA corresponding to amino acids 274–355 and ligating it into pET-GST cut with NheI and BamHI. Multiple Tissue Northern Blots—Probe containing the SIRT6 open reading frame was created using the PrimeIt Random Primer Labeling kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This 32P-labeled fragment was used to probe Stratagene Multiple Tissue Northern Blots according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blots were then stripped and reprobed with the actin probe included in the kit. Antibody Production—pET28a-His6-mSIRT6 and pET-GST-mSIRT6-(274–355) were transformed into BL21(DE3)-Codon Plus-RP cells (Stratagene) and inoculated into 4- or 2-liter cultures of LB (50 mg/ml kanamycin and 35 mg/ml chloramphenicol), respectively. The cells were grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.7. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm for 2 h, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cells containing the pET28a-His6-mSIRT6 plasmid were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.1 m NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, 8 m urea, pH 8.0) and lysed by freezing in liquid N2. The lysate was centrifuged at 19,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. The supernatant was incubated with 4 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Stratagene) for 3 h at 4 °C, loaded onto a column, and washed extensively with wash buffer (0.1 m NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, 8 m urea, pH 6.4). The purified protein was eluted with elution buffer (0.1 m NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, 8 m urea, pH 3.0) in 1.5-ml fractions. The pH was neutralized by the immediate addition of 100 μlof1 m Tris base. The fractions containing protein were pooled and dialyzed against PBS. This protein was sent to Covance Reseach Bioproducts for antibody production. The cells containing the pET-GST-SIRT6-(274–355) plasmid were resuspended in PBSTG (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and 0.1 g of lysozyme, incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and frozen in liquid N2. The lysis was completed by sonication, and the lysate was centrifuged at 19,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with 4 ml of GST-agarose (Sigma) for 3 h at 4 °C and loaded onto a column. The column was washed extensively with PBSTG, and the protein was eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris, 10 mm glutathione, pH 7.5). Fractions containing protein were dialyzed against PBS and sent to Covance Reseach Bioproducts for antibody production. The antibodies were affinity-purified as follows. Aliquots of the proteins used to generate the antibodies were attached to1 ml of NHS-activated Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 ml of the final bleed of each antibody was combined with 10 ml of antibody wash buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and applied to the column. Each column was washed extensively with antibody wash buffer, and the antibody was eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5. The pH was neutralized by the addition of 0.1 volume of 1 m Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5. The antibodies were then subjected to a second round of affinity purification, but this time the anti-mSIRT6 (full-length) antibody was applied to the SIRT6-(274–355) column, and the anti-mSIRT6-(274–355) antibody was applied to the SIRT6 (full length) column. Western Blot Analysis—Homogenized mouse tissues from four mice of the FVB genetic background were obtained as a generous gift from L. Bordone (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). From these samples, SDS-solubilized proteins were prepared (27Kain S.R. Mai K. Sinai P. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 982-987PubMed Google Scholar), equal amounts of which were used for Western analysis. For Western detection, samples were resolved on 4–15% Tris-HCl gradient gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blocked using 4% nonfat dry milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Primary anti-mSIRT6 antibody was diluted 1:400 in PBS-T before incubation with membranes. Rabbit anti-ADP-ribose antibody (27Kain S.R. Mai K. Sinai P. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 982-987PubMed Google Scholar), a generous gift from H. Hilz, was used at a 1:100 dilution in PBS-T. Anti-actin C4 (Sigma) was used as a loading control (1:5000) in multiple tissue Western blots. Secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1:10,000). Chemiluminescent detection was achieved by incubation with the ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence and GFP Microscopy—NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h on gelatintreated 18-mm circular glass coverslips in 6-well plates. Cells were fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed twice with PBS, and then permeabilized by a 3-min treatment with 0.2% Triton X-100. Coverslips were gently washed twice with PBS and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin for 15 min, transferred to a rack, and washed in PBS. Affinity-purified primary antibody was added at a 1:100 dilution. Staining proceeded for 45 min, and cells were then washed twice for 5 min in fresh PBS. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated chicken antirabbit IgG was diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with coverslips for 45 min. Coverslips were mounted with VectaShield mounting media containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyindole, dilactate (Vector, Burlingame, CA). Microscopy was performed on a Nikon Eclipse E500 fluorescence microscope. Digital images were obtained using a SPOT RT charge-coupled device camera and software using identical exposure times for comparable samples. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with 5 μg of each GFP construct using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were grown for 48 h on glass coverslips. Samples were fixed, DAPI-stained, and visualized as described above. Purification of Recombinant SIRT6 Protein—BL21(DE3)-Codon Plus-RP Escherichia coli (Stratagene) were transformed with the mSIRT6 expression plasmids. Protein purifications were performed essentially as described for antibody purification. Briefly, fusion protein expression was induced in 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 1 h. The induced His6-tagged proteins were purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) under native conditions. The control eluate was prepared from a bacterial clone carrying pET28a vector alone. GST-tagged proteins were purified by a similar method, with affinity purification accomplished with glutathione-agarose beads (Pierce). Control eluate for GST-tagged proteins was prepared from bacteria carrying pET28-GST. Aliquots of recombinant proteins were stored at –70 °C. ADP-ribosylation Assays and Detection of ADP-ribosylated Proteins—ADP-ribosylation assays were performed essentially as described previously (22Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2774) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Reactions were performed in a 50-μl total volume containing 5 μg of recombinant SIRT6 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (at 22 °C), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm unlabeled NAD, and 8 μCi of [32P]NAD (800 Ci mmol–1; Amersham Biosciences). Reactions also contained 2.5 μg of core histones as indicated. For reactions containing both His6-tagged and GST-tagged recombinant SIRT6 protein, 2.5 μg of each protein was added. Prior to SDS-PAGE analysis, all reactions were purified from unincorporated [32P]NAD using Micro Bio-Spin chromatography columns (Bio-Rad) with a 6000-Da exclusion limit. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane before autoradiography and subsequent immunoblot analysis. Blots were stained with Coomassie Blue, and the Coomassie Blue-stained bands and Western signals were aligned to verify that the radioactive bands were SIRT6. Quantitation of ADP-ribosylation—ADP-ribosylation reactions were performed as described above, but with the following modifications. Total reaction volume was 40 μl, including ∼0.5 μg of protein, 0.8 μl of 6.25 μm [32P]NAD, and 4 μl of 10 μm NAD. Purified reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE, and bovine serum albumin standards of 5, 2, 0.8, 0.4, and 0.1 μg were included on the same gel. SIRT6 protein concentrations in each lane were determined by comparison with these standards upon Coomassie Blue staining. Gel was analyzed by autoradiography, and radioactive SIRT6 bands were excised. Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting on a Beckman LS 6500 Liquid Scintillation Counter. A standard curve relating NAD quantity to radioactivity was generated by scintillation counting of known pmol quantities of [32P]NAD diluted to reflect the ratio of unlabeled to labeled NAD in the original reaction. This curve was used to estimate pmol of NAD incorporated in SIRT6 bands. For each band, pmol of NAD was divided by pmol of SIRT6. This final value reflects the molar ratio of total incorporated ADP-ribose to SIRT6. mSIRT6 Expression in Mice and Embryos—To determine the expression pattern of mSIRT6, we analyzed RNA extracts from eight adult mouse tissues by Northern blotting (Fig. 2A). Using a cDNA probe corresponding to the 5′ region of mSIRT6, expression of mSIRT6 mRNA was observed in every tissue type tested (Fig. 2A). Confirming the predictions of sequence analysis (23Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar), mSIRT6 was detected as a single 1.0-kb transcript, suggesting that this gene is not found in alternate splice forms. When normalized to actin, the highest levels of mSIRT6 mRNA were seen in the brain, heart, and liver, with the lowest expression level observed in skeletal muscle. To evaluate mSIRT6 levels during development, we probed Northern blots of RNA from four mouse embryonic stages from embryonic day E7 to E17 (Fig. 2B). Mouse SIRT6 transcript was readily detectable in all embryonic samples, reaching a peak at E11. Having established the prevalence of mSIRT6 message in embryonic and adult tissues, we wished to determine the distribution of mSIRT6 protein. Affinity-purified antiserum specific to mSIRT6 was used to probe Western blots of proteins isolated from eight adult murine tissue types (Fig. 2C). For each tissue type, samples from four individual animals were obtained and analyzed by immunoblot. As illustrated in Fig. 2C, mSIRT6 protein was detectable in all tissue types as a single 40-kDa band. As expected from Northern analysis, levels were high in brain, liver, and heart when normalized to actin protein levels. Surprisingly, mSIRT6 protein was most strongly expressed in muscle (Fig. 2C), despite the relative paucity of its transcript in this tissue. This observation might indicate increased mSIRT6 transcript stability in muscle or an enhanced rate of translation in this tissue type relative to others tested. Visualization of mSIRT6-GFP in Nuclei—In order to observe the subcellular localization of mSIRT6, we engineered two GFP fusion expression vectors under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Both a C-terminal (mSIRT6-GFP) and an N-terminal (GFP-mSIRT6) fusion construct were transfected into NIH 3T3 cells grown on glass coverslips. Samples were cultured for 48 h, at which point they were fixed, washed, and DAPI-stained to reveal nucleic acids. Fluorescence microscopy of cells harboring each GFP fusion construct showed strong localization of mSIRT6-GFP to the nucleus, accompanied by diffuse cytoplasmic staining, as judged by colocalization of DAPI-stained nuclei (Fig. 3A). As expected, transfection of GFP alone caused intense fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus. Indirect Immunofluorescence of mSIRT6 —To visualize endogenous levels of mSIRT6, affinity-purified rabbit antisera to two different mSIRT6 antigens were used to probe NIH 3T3 cells by indirect immunofluorescence. As a control, cells were incubated without primary antibody and subsequently stained with DAPI and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Very faint background staining was seen throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus in these control samples (Fig. 3B). Strikingly, mSIRT6 showed strong staining predominantly in the nucleus (Fig. 3B), regardless of which anti-mSIRT6 antibody was used in the primary incubation. In both cases, endogenous mSIRT6 appeared to be excluded from the nucleolus. Importantly, immunofluorescence and GFP localization studies revealed the same predominantly nuclear localization pattern for mSIRT6. We therefore conclude that the majority of mSIRT6 is found in the nucleus, whereas a small fraction may be localized to the cytoplasm. mSIRT6 Catalyzes the Transfer of 32P from a 32P-labeled NAD Donor—Of the seven mammalian Sir2 homologs, only SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3, and SIRT5 have been shown to have NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase activity in vitro (15North B.J. Marshall B.L. Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 437-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Consistent with published reports, we did not observe any protein deacetylase activity of mouse or human SIRT6 using a variety of experimental conditions and potential substrates (data not shown). Several sirtuins also possess a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (19Tanny J.C. Dowd G.J. Huang J. Hilz H. Moazed D. Cell. 1999; 99: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to test whether mSIRT6 could catalyze the transfer of radiolabel from [32P]NAD+ to histones, an assay of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. His6-tagged human SIRT1 and mSIRT6 were expressed in E. coli and purified by chromatography. Equal amounts of hSIRT1 and mSIRT6 were incubated with [32P]NAD+ in the presence and absence of core histones (Fig. 4A). Whereas hSIRT1 transferred label efficiently to histones, mSIRT6 failed to do so (Fig. 4A). However, mSIRT6 catalyzed the robust transfer of label to itself, regardless of whether histones were present in the reaction (Fig. 4A). Control extracts purified from E. coli containing vector alone possessed no detectable activity under these conditions (data not shown). We wished to determine whether 32P transfer stimulated by mSIRT6 required the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Two point mutations in highly conserved residues within the mSIRT6 core domain were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1). The histidine residue at position 133 was changed to tyrosine (mSIRT6-H133Y), a mutation previously demonstrated to abolish enzymatic activity in human and yeast Sir2 proteins (17Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 19Tanny J.C. Dowd G.J. Huang J. Hilz H. Moazed D. Cell. 1999; 99: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In a separate construct, the phylogenetically invariant serine residue at position 56 was mutated to alanine (mSIRT6-S56A). Serine 56 is buried deep in the active site of the enzyme and does not appear to be structurally important (28Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Both mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli, purified, and incubated in the presence of [32P]NAD+ as described above. Unincorporated NAD was removed by chromatography column. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to film. Whereas wild-type mSIRT6 efficiently transferred 32P radiolabel to itself, no label transfer was detected in mutants mSIRT6-S56A and mSIRT6-H133Y (Fig. 4C). The presence of mutant proteins on the membrane was verified by Western blotting using affinity-purified antibody to mSIRT6 (Fig. 4B). Based on this requirement for two catalytic core residues, we conclude that mSIRT6 catalyzes the transfer of radiolabel from [32P]NAD by an enzymatic mechanism. Labeling of proteins with [32P]NAD+ can also occur nonenzymatically by the covalent binding of NAD. Such labeling, as observed in the case of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (29Zhang J. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9382-9385Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), can be misinterpreted as ADP-ribosylation of specific amino acid acceptors (29Zhang J. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9382-9385Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 30Itoga M. Tsuchiya M. Ishino H. Shimoyama M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 1041-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We have observed low levels of nonspecific radiolabeling of proteins incubated in the presence of [32P]NAD+. Under our reaction conditions, such modification occurs in core histones and enzymatically inactive Sir2 point mutants, generally not labeling >0.001% of total protein after a 1-h incubation at 30 °C (Fig. 5), as determined by scintillation counting of protein bands. In contrast, in the case of mSIRT6, we observed incorporation of a molar quantity of ADP-ribose equivalent to 15% of total moles of mSIRT6 present in the reaction (Fig. 5). For this reason, and because of the difference in labeling efficiency between wild-type and point-mutant varieties of mSIRT6, we conclude that the transfer of 32P radiolabel occurs via a robust enzymatic mechanism. Auto-ADP-ribosylation of mSIRT6 —To test the hypothesis that mSIRT6 catalyzed the mono-ADP-ribosylation of itself, we probed the reaction products from the above label transfer reactions with an antibody specific to mono-ADP-ribose (31Meyer T. Hilz H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 155: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This antibody recognized a band corresponding to the radiolabeled mSIRT6 following incubation with [32P]NAD (Fig. 6A). No band was present at the corresponding position in preparations from mutant mSIRT6 (Fig. 6A), demonstrating the specificity of the antibody for the modified form of mSIRT6. This evidence strongly suggests that this modified form of mSIRT6 is mono-ADP-ribosylated. Whereas our results do not rule out the possibility that the modification of wild-type mSIRT6 occurs in E. coli before purification, the absence of signal in point mutant SIRT6 indicates that mono-ADP-ribosylation depends on the catalytic activity of mSIRT6. Having confirmed mono-ADP-ribosylation as the nature of the modification of mSIRT6, we wished to ascertain whether this modification was catalyzed in an inter- or intra-molecular fashion. mSIRT6 and two different mutants (H133Y and S56A) were used in a molecular cis/trans test for enzymatic activity. GST-mSIRT6 was purified from E. coli and incubated in combination with His6-tagged mutant and wild-type mSIRT6 in the presence of [32P]NAD. Reactions were purified as described before and subjected to autoradiography. Labeled GST-mSIRT6 migrated as an ∼80-kDa band in all reactions (Fig. 6B). His6-tagged mSIRT6 migrated as a strongly labeled 39-kDa band (Fig. 6B). However, this band was absent from the corresponding reactions of both His6-tagged mutants, demonstrating that GST-mSIRT6 was unable to ADP-ribosylate those proteins. Coomassie Blue staining of the gel prior to film exposure revealed similar amounts of protein in all three lanes (data not shown). We therefore conclude that the auto-ADP-ribosylation reaction catalyzed by mSIRT6 is intra-molecular. Here we provide the first characterization of a class IV sirtuin, mouse SIRT6. This sirtuin shows a relatively weak sequence homology to the yeast Sir2 (25%), suggesting a significant divergence in function and enzymatic activity. Consistent with published findings, we failed to detect any NAD-dependent protein deacetylase activity in preparations of mSIRT6 expressed in bacterial and mammalian cells. Surprisingly, mSIRT6 did show a robust ADP-ribosyltransferase activity in vitro, indicating that recombinant bacterial preparations indeed contained active protein. We conclude that mSIRT6 is a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase for the following reasons. First, the purified protein can catalyze the transfer of radiolabel from [32P]NAD, a reaction also catalyzed by other Sir2 family members (17Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 19Tanny J.C. Dowd G.J. Huang J. Hilz H. Moazed D. Cell. 1999; 99: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 22Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2774) Google Scholar) and previously shown to be mono-ADP-ribosylation (19Tanny J.C. Dowd G.J. Huang J. Hilz H. Moazed D. Cell. 1999; 99: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Second, this activity requires the catalytic function of mSIRT6 because two different point mutations in phylogenetically invariant residues predicted to abolish enzymatic activity eliminated the transfer of label from NAD to mSIRT6. Third, only the enzymatically modified form of mSIRT6 is recognized by an anti-ADP-ribose antibody specific to mono-ADP-ribosylated proteins. Finally, the transfer of label from [32P]NAD to mSIRT6 is accomplished by an intra-molecular mechanism, indicating that SIRT6 may use ADP-ribosylation as a way to auto-regulate its activity. Recombinant mSIRT6 expressed in E. coli and incubated with NAD was able to incorporate a quantity of ADP-ribose equivalent to 15% of the moles of mSIRT6 present in the reaction. This level of ADP-ribosylation is impressive, considering the intra-molecular nature of the reaction, by which a molecule of SIRT6 is only active on a single substrate molecule. We failed to observe a band shift resulting from ADP-riboyslation, suggesting that the number of amino acid residues ADP-ribosylated on mSIRT6 is very small. Assuming a single ADP-ribosylation per molecule of SIRT6, our results indicate a strong 15% activity in our recombinant protein preparations. Mouse SIRT6 is broadly expressed at the RNA and protein levels throughout development and during adulthood in at least eight different tissue types, indicating broad expression throughout the organism. The SIRT6 protein is particularly abundant in brain and liver. Interestingly, mSIRT6 protein expression is highest in muscle, even though mRNA levels in this tissue are low relative to those of actin. This might indicate increased SIRT6 protein stability in muscle compared with other tissue types. Alternatively, the disproportionate amount of SIRT6 protein observed in muscle may result from an increased rate of translation of SIRT6 mRNA in this tissue type. Localization studies of mSIRT6 using N- and C-terminal GFP fusions as well as antibodies to two different epitopes showed that expression of mSIRT6 was largely nuclear, with only a diffuse presence in cytoplasm. Interestingly, endogenous levels of SIRT6 do not permeate certain intra-nuclear regions, probably corresponding to the nucleolus (Fig. 3B). The only other mouse class IV sirtuin, mSIRT7, is localized to the nucleolus. 2E. Ford and L. Guarente, unpublished data. We therefore speculate that mSIRT6 and mSIRT7, despite extensive sequence homology (39%), have non-overlapping functions within the cell. Like SIRT6, SIRT7 has not been shown to possess any in vitro protein deacetylase activity (15North B.J. Marshall B.L. Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 437-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Several ADP-ribosyltransferases are capable of reversible auto-modification resulting in altered enzymatic activity. Pseudomonas ExoS, a bifunctional enzyme, is a Rho GTPase-activating protein as well as an ADP-ribosyltransferase (25Riese M.J. Goehring U.M. Ehrmantraut M.E. Moss J. Barbieri J.T. Aktories K. Schmidt G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12082-12088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Auto-ADP-ribosylation at arginine 146, observed in vitro and in vivo, reduces GTPase-activating protein activity (25Riese M.J. Goehring U.M. Ehrmantraut M.E. Moss J. Barbieri J.T. Aktories K. Schmidt G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12082-12088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suggesting a mechanism for intra-molecular regulation. In mammals, auto-modification of ADP-ribosyltransferase 5 converts the protein from NADase to transferase (26Weng B. Thompson W.C. Kim H.J. Levine R.L. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31797-31803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), again suggesting a mechanism for regulation of enzyme activity. We speculate that SIRT6 might regulate its own activity in vivo by ADP-ribosylation of specific residues required for activity. At this time, we have not yet identified the physiological targets of SIRT6. Unlike class I sirtuins including yeast Sir2 and SIRT1, SIRT6 appears to be highly specific in vitro, even failing to catalyze ADP-ribosylation of SIRT6 molecules in trans. The discovery of auto-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity in preparations of recombinant mouse SIRT6 is the first report of enzymatic activity for any class IV sirtuin. Future experiments will aim to identify physiological substrates ADP-ribosylated by SIRT6. We thank H. Hilz (Hamburg, Germany) for the ADP-ribose antibody. We also thank Laura Bordone (Guarente laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology) for the kind contribution of mouse tissue protein samples.

In many organisms, this signaling pathway directs axis formation. Although the importance of intracellular components of the pathway, including beta-catenin and Tcf3, has been established, the mechanism of their activation is uncertain. In Xenopus, the initiating signal that localizes beta-catenin to dorsal nuclei has been suggested to be intracellular and Wnt independent. Here, we provide three lines of evidence that the pathway specifying the dorsal axis is activated extracellularly in Xenopus embryos. First, we identify Wnt11 as the initiating signal. Second, we show that activation requires the glycosyl transferase X.EXT1. Third, we find that the EGF-CFC protein, FRL1, is also essential and interacts with Wnt11 to activate canonical Wnt signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2026569756,"Although DNA damaging agents have revolutionized chemotherapy against solid tumors, a narrow therapeutic window combined with severe side effects has limited their broader use. Here we show that RAD001 (everolimus), a rapamycin derivative, dramatically enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis in wild-type p53, but not mutant p53 tumor cells. The use of isogenic tumor cell lines expressing either wild-type mTOR cDNA or a mutant that does not bind RAD001 demonstrates that the effects of RAD001 are through inhibition of mTOR function. We further show that RAD001 sensitizes cells to cisplatin by inhibiting p53-induced p21 expression. Unexpectedly, this effect is attributed to a small but significant inhibition of p21 translation combined with its short half-life. These findings provide the molecular rationale for combining DNA damaging agents with RAD001, showing that a general effect on a major anabolic process may dramatically enhance the efficacy of an established drug protocol in the treatment of cancer patients with solid tumors."

Little, however, isknown about the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme. HEXA and HEXB are the two other genes that encode enzymescatalyzing the hydrolytic cleavage of terminal N-acetylglucosamineresidues from glycoconjugates. The gene products of HEXA andHEXB predominantly yield two dimeric isozymes. The homodimericisozyme, hexosaminidase B (ββ), is composed of two β-subunits,and the heterodimeric isozyme, hexosaminidase A (αβ), is composedof an α- and a β-subunit. Both of these enzymes are normallylocalized within the lysosome. The two subunits bear a high level of sequenceidentity, and both are members of family 20 of glycoside hydrolases. Thedysfunction of either of these isozymes results in the accumulation ofgangliosides and other glycoconjugates within the lysosome causing theinheritable neurodegenerative disorders known as Tay-Sachs and Sandhoffdiseases (25Triggs-Raine B.

Indeed, thecontrol of glycosidase function using small molecules offers severaladvantages over genetic knock-out studies, including the ability to rapidlyvary dose or entirely withdraw treatment. A major hurdle, however, in thegeneration of selective inhibitors of human glycosidases is that multiplefunctionally related enzymes are often present within a given organism. Thepromiscuity of many inhibitors and the resultant inhibition of multipleenzymes render them of limited utility in studying the cellular and organismalphysiological role of one particular enzyme because they necessarily generatecomplex phenotypes.

Streptozotocin (STZ) has long beenused as a diabetogenic compound because it has a particularly detrimentaleffect on β-islet cells(36Junod A. Lambert A.E. Orci L. Pictet R. Gonet A.E. Renold A.E.

Okamoto H. Nature. 1981; 294: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) with the net effect ofdepleting cellular NAD+ levels and, ultimately, leading to celldeath (40Yamada K. Nonaka K.

Nat.Med. 1999; 5: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Other investigators haveproposed instead that STZ toxicity is a consequence of the irreversibleinhibition of O-GlcNAcase, which is highly expressed within isletβ-cells (32Konrad R.J. Mikolaenko I. Tolar J.F. Liu K. Kudlow J.E. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar,42Roos M.D. Xie W. Su K. Clark J.A. Yang X. Chin E. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Proc. Assoc.Am. Physicians. 1998; 110: 422-432PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis has,however, been brought into question by two independent research groups(43Gao Y. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,44Okuyama R. Yachi M. Biochem.Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because cellularO-GlcNAc levels increase in response to many forms of cellular stress(45Zachara N.E. O'Donnell N. Cheung W.D. Mercer J.J. Marth J.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol.Chem. 2004; 279: 30133-30142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), it seems possible thatSTZ results in increased O-GlcNAc levels by inducing cellular stressrather than through any specific and direct action on O-GlcNAcase.Indeed, Hanover et al.(46Hanover J.A. Lai Z. Lee G. Lubas W.A. Sato S.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have shown that STZfunctions as a poor and somewhat selective inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase,and although it has been proposed by others that STZ acts to irreversiblyinhibit O-GlcNAcase(47Liu K. Paterson A.J. Konrad R.J. Parlow A.F. Jimi S. Roh M. Chin Jr., E. Kudlow J.E. Mol.Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 194: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), there has been no cleardemonstration of this mode of action. The second compound that has enjoyed use as an inhibitor ofO-GlcNAcase isO-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate(PUGNAc). Rast and co-workers(28Horsch M. Hoesch L. Vasella A. Rast D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) described the potentinhibitory properties of PUGNAc on β-N-acetylglucosaminidasesfrom Canavalia ensiformis, Mucor rouxii, and the family 20β-hexosaminidase from bovine kidney. This compound has also been shown tobe a highly potent inhibitor of mouse β-hexosaminidase(48Miller D.J. Gong X. Shur B.D. Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 1279-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recent studies havedemonstrated that PUGNAc is also a potent inhibitor of the family 84O-GlcNAcase (21Dong D.L. Hart G.W. J.Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) thatlacks the cytotoxic effects of STZ(49Haltiwanger R.S. Grove K. Philipsberg G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3611-3617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Despite its apparentlack of short term toxicity, this compound is a potent inhibitor of both thefamily 20 and family 84 glycoside hydrolases, and therefore in vivostudies using this compound will yield a complex phenotype stemming from theinhibition of these functionally related enzymes. Given these considerations, we felt that the development of a potent,cell-permeable inhibitor selective for O-GlcNAcase over the lysosomalβ-hexosaminidases would be a valuable tool in studying the physiologicalrole of O-GlcNAc at the cellular and organismal level. A logicalstarting point for the design of such an inhibitor for O-GlcNAcasewould take into consideration the catalytic mechanism of these twofunctionally related enzymes. Although the catalytic mechanisms of action ofthe family 20 human β-hexosaminidases A and B have been fairly wellestablished (50Mark B.L. Mahuran D.J. Cherney M.M. Zhao D. Knapp S. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 1093-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), that of thefamily 84 O-GlcNAcase remains unknown. We therefore aimed to firstelucidate the catalytic mechanism of human O-GlcNAcase and second touse this information in designing simple inhibitors that would be potent, cellpermeable, and highly selective for O-GlcNAcase over the lysosomalβ-hexosaminidases. General Procedures for Synthesis of Compounds—All buffersalts used in this study were obtained from Sigma. Dry methanol and toluenewere purchased from Acros Organics.

Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 0.48 g, 2.3 mmol) anddifluoroacetic acid (0.12 ml, 0.18 g, 1.3 mmol) were added to the reactionmixture via syringe. The resulting solution was allowed to stand for 16 h at 0°C, after which time 2 drops of difluoroacetic acid were added.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of 4-Methylumbelliferyl2-Deoxy-2-fluoroacetamido-β-d-glucopyranosides—Aspatula tip of anhydrous sodium methoxide was added to a solution of eachglycoside in dry methanol. The resulting basic solution was stirred undernitrogen until the reaction was judged complete by TLC analysis. Dowex50-H+ resin was added to the stirred reaction mixture until the pHof the solution became neutral. The suspension was filtered, and the filtercake was rinsed extensively with methanol, after which the solvent from thecombined filtrates was removed in vacuo.

Time-dependent assay of β-hexosaminidase and O-GlcNAcaserevealed that both enzymes were stable over this period in their respectivebuffers: 50 mm citrate, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% BSA, pH 4.25,and 50 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl,0.1% BSA, pH 6.5. The progress of the reaction at the end of 30 min wasdetermined by measuring the extent of 4-methylumbelliferone liberated asdetermined by fluorescence measurements using a Varian CARY EclipseFluorescence Spectrophotometer 96-well plate system and comparison to astandard curve of 4-methylumbelliferone under identical buffer conditions.Excitation and emission wavelengths of 368 and 450 nm were used,respectively, with 5 mm slit openings. The possible time-dependentinactivation of O-GlcNAcase was assayed by incubating 10mm STZ with 0.016 mg/ml O-GlcNAcase in the presence of 50mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% BSA, 5mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.5, or 0.036 mg/mlβ-hexosaminidase in the presence of 50 mm citrate, 100mm NaCl, 0.1% BSA, pH 4.25.

https://openalex.org/W2010526388,"The presequence translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane (TIM23 complex) operates at a central junction of protein import. It accepts preproteins from the outer membrane TOM complex and directs them to inner membrane insertion or, in cooperation with the presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM), to the matrix. Little is known of how the TIM23 complex coordinates these tasks. We have identified Tim21 (YGR033c) that interacts with the TOM complex. Tim21 is specific for a TIM23 form that cooperates with TOM and promotes inner membrane insertion. Protein translocation into the matrix requires a switch to a Tim21-free, PAM bound presequence translocase. Tim17 is crucial for the switch by performing two separable functions: promotion of inner membrane insertion and binding of Pam18 to form the functional TIM-PAM complex. Thus, the presequence translocase is not a static complex but switches between TOM tethering and PAM binding in a reaction cycle involving Tim21 and Tim17."
https://openalex.org/W2158645874,"Cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in mammals are controlled by SREBPs, a family of membrane bound transcription factors. Our studies identified homologs of SREBP, its binding partner SCAP, and the ER retention protein Insig in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, named sre1+, scp1+, and ins1+. Like SREBP, Sre1 is cleaved and activated in response to sterol depletion in a Scp1-dependent manner. Microarray analysis revealed that Sre1 activates sterol biosynthetic enzymes as in mammals, and, surprisingly, Sre1 also stimulates transcription of genes required for adaptation to hypoxia. Furthermore, Sre1 rapidly activates these target genes in response to low oxygen and is itself required for anaerobic growth. Based on these findings, we propose and test a model in which Sre1 and Scp1 monitor oxygen-dependent sterol synthesis as an indirect measure of oxygen supply and mediate a hypoxic response in fission yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2108967804,"Grapheme-color synesthetes experience specific colors associated with specific number or letter characters. To determine the neural locus of this condition, we compared behavioral and fMRI responses in six grapheme-color synesthetes to control subjects. In our behavioral experiments, we found that a subject's synesthetic experience can aid in texture segregation (experiment 1) and reduce the effects of crowding (experiment 2). For synesthetes, graphemes produced larger fMRI responses in color-selective area human V4 than for control subjects (experiment 3). Importantly, we found a correlation within subjects between the behavioral and fMRI results; subjects with better performance on the behavioral experiments showed larger fMRI responses in early retinotopic visual areas (V1, V2, V3, and hV4). These results suggest that grapheme-color synesthesia is the result of cross-activation between grapheme-selective and color-selective brain areas. The correlation between the behavioral and fMRI results suggests that grapheme-color synesthetes may constitute a heterogeneous group."
https://openalex.org/W2151322467,"p63 is a master regulator of stratified epithelial development that is both necessary and sufficient for specifying this multifaceted program. We show here that Perp, a tetraspan membrane protein originally identified as an apoptosis-associated target of the p53 tumor suppressor, is the first direct target of p63 clearly involved in mediating this developmental program in vivo. During embryogenesis, Perp is expressed in an epithelial pattern, and its expression depends on p63. Perp−/− mice die postnatally, with dramatic blistering in stratified epithelia symptomatic of compromised adhesion. Perp localizes specifically to desmosomes, adhesion junctions important for tissue integrity, and numerous structural defects in desmosomes are observed in Perp-deficient skin, suggesting a role for Perp in promoting the stable assembly of desmosomal adhesive complexes. These findings demonstrate that Perp is a key effector in the p63 developmental program, playing an essential role in an adhesion subprogram central to epithelial integrity and homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W1969789251,"Double-stranded RNA virions are transcriptionally competent icosahedral particles that must translocate across a lipid bilayer to function within the cytoplasm of the target cell. Birnaviruses are unique among dsRNA viruses as they have a single T = 13 icosahedral shell, lacking the characteristic inner capsid observed in the others. We determined the crystal structures of the T = 1 subviral particle (260 Å in diameter) and of the T = 13 intact virus particle (700 Å in diameter) of an avian birnavirus to 3 Å and 7 Å resolution, respectively. Our results show that VP2, the only component of the virus icosahedral capsid, is homologous both to the capsid protein of positive-strand RNA viruses, like the T = 3 nodaviruses, and to the T = 13 capsid protein of members of the Reoviridae family of dsRNA viruses. Together, these results provide important insights into the multiple functions of the birnavirus capsid and reveal unexpected structural relationships among icosahedral viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1972509609,"Patterning the dorsal surface of the Drosophila blastoderm embryo requires Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Screw (Scw), two BMP family members. Signaling by these ligands is regulated at the extracellular level by the BMP binding proteins Sog and Tsg. We demonstrate that Tsg and Sog play essential roles in transporting Dpp to the dorsal-most cells. Furthermore, we provide biochemical and genetic evidence that a heterodimer of Dpp and Scw, but not the Dpp homodimer, is the primary transported ligand and that the heterodimer signals synergistically through the two type I BMP receptors Tkv and Sax. We propose that the use of broadly distributed Dpp homodimers and spatially restricted Dpp/Scw heterodimers produces the biphasic signal that is responsible for specifying the two dorsal tissue types. Finally, we demonstrate mathematically that heterodimer levels can be less sensitive to changes in gene dosage than homodimers, thereby providing further selective advantage for using heterodimers as morphogens."

Significantly, endogenous mouse alpha-synuclein also accumulated in normal and degenerating axons and axon terminals in association with oligodendroglia and neuron loss and slowly progressive motor impairments. Our studies demonstrate that overexpression of alpha-synuclein in oligodendrocytes of mice results in MSA-like degeneration in the CNS and that alpha-synuclein inclusions in oligodendrocytes participate in the degeneration of neurons in MSA."
https://openalex.org/W2011368229,"Protein quality control degradation systems rid the cell of aberrant proteins, preventing detrimental effects on normal cellular function. Although such systems have been identified in most subcellular compartments, none have been found in the nucleus. Here, we report the discovery of such a system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is defined by San1p, a ubiquitin-protein ligase that, in conjunction with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Cdc34p and Ubc1p, targets four distinct mutant nuclear proteins for ubiquitination and destruction by the proteasome. San1p has exquisite specificity for aberrant proteins and does not target the wild-type versions of its mutant substrates. San1p is nuclear localized and requires nuclear localization for function. Loss of SAN1 results in a chronic stress response, underscoring its role of protein quality control in the cell. We propose that San1p-mediated degradation acts as the last line of proteolytic defense against the deleterious accumulation of aberrant proteins in the nucleus and that analogous systems exist in other eukaryotes.

San1p has exquisite specificity for aberrant proteins and does not target the wild-type versions of its mutant substrates. San1p is nuclear localized and requires nuclear localization for function. Loss of SAN1 results in a chronic stress response, underscoring its role of protein quality control in the cell. We propose that San1p-mediated degradation acts as the last line of proteolytic defense against the deleterious accumulation of aberrant proteins in the nucleus and that analogous systems exist in other eukaryotes. Aberrant proteins can be produced in the cell by mutation, transcriptional or translational errors, incorrect folding, imbalanced subunit synthesis, improper trafficking, or damage caused by environmental conditions or metabolic byproducts (Goldberg, 2003Goldberg A.L. Protein degradation and protection against misfolded or damaged proteins.Nature. 2003; 426: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). Accumulation or persistence of aberrant proteins within the cell can often have deleterious consequences. For example, aberrant proteins may lose regulation, may form inactive complexes that compete with functional complexes, may assemble into aggregates that eliminate protein function or cause toxicity, or may introduce harmful activities if mislocalized. In humans, accumulation of aberrant proteins may underlie the pathology of diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, Parkinson’s, and prion pathologies like Creutzfeld-Jakob’s (Shastry, 2003Shastry B.S. Neurodegenerative disorders of protein aggregation.Neurochem. Int. 2003; 43: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To minimize harmful effects from aberrant proteins, the cell possesses a set of protein quality control (PQC) systems that operate in distinct ways. Some PQC systems function in repair, such as protein chaperones that refold or sequester aberrantly folded proteins (Stirling et al., 2003Stirling P.C. Lundin V.F. Leroux M.R. Getting a grip on non-native proteins.EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Protein chaperones reside in every major cellular compartment and function either by refolding misfolded proteins (e.g., Hsp70 and Hsp90), binding to misfolded proteins and preventing aggregation (e.g., Hsp40), or disrupting protein aggregates (e.g., Hsp104). Not all aberrant proteins can be repaired, however. For these lost causes, the cell has PQC systems that function in disposal, such as proteolytic systems that destroy proteins that are mutant, damaged, or misfolded and recalcitrant to refolding (Goldberg, 2003Goldberg A.L. Protein degradation and protection against misfolded or damaged proteins.Nature. 2003; 426: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). PQC degradation systems have been identified in the cytoplasm, the secretory pathway, and mitochondria. In the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PQC degradation is primarily brought about by protein-ubiquitination complexes that mark proteins for proteasomal degradation (Hampton, 2002Hampton R.Y. ER-associated degradation in protein quality control and cellular regulation.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, McDonough and Patterson, 2003McDonough H. Patterson C. CHIP: a link between the chaperone and proteasome systems.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, Trombetta and Parodi, 2003Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. Quality control and protein folding in the secretory pathway.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). PQC degradation in the cytoplasm and ER can also occur via transport to the lysosome/vacuole (Trombetta and Parodi, 2003Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. Quality control and protein folding in the secretory pathway.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In the mitochondria, localized proteases function in PQC degradation (Arnold and Langer, 2002Arnold I. Langer T. Membrane protein degradation by AAA proteases in mitochondria.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Repair and degradation systems may not be mutually exclusive, as various protein chaperones appear to interface with PQC degradation systems (McDonough and Patterson, 2003McDonough H. Patterson C. CHIP: a link between the chaperone and proteasome systems.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, Trombetta and Parodi, 2003Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. Quality control and protein folding in the secretory pathway.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). How the cell targets and destroys aberrant proteins depends upon how and when aberrant proteins are produced. Aberrant proteins may be evident immediately upon production due to errors in synthesis or folding. It is estimated that nearly a third of all newly synthesized proteins are defective and destroyed during or shortly after synthesis (Schubert et al., 2000Schubert U. Antón L.C. Gibbs J. Norbury C.C. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Rapid degradation of a large fraction of newly synthesized proteins by proteasomes.Nature. 2000; 404: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), indicating that PQC degradation systems may be intimately linked with the production process. Properly synthesized proteins can become aberrant even after they are performing their normal functions. Postproduction damage can be caused by physical or chemical means including heat, irradiation, free radicals, and changes in hydration or osmolarity (Goldberg, 2003Goldberg A.L. Protein degradation and protection against misfolded or damaged proteins.Nature. 2003; 426: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). It is not clear if particular PQC degradation systems are dedicated exclusively to production-level defects or postproduction damage or if they target both classes of aberrant proteins. In contrast to the cytoplasm, ER, and mitochondria, very little is known about PQC in the nucleus. A number of chaperones have been implicated in protein refolding and disaggregation in the nucleus (Parsell et al., 1994Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Protein disaggregation mediated by heat-shock protein Hsp104.Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, Rossi and Lindquist, 1989Rossi J.M. Lindquist S. The intracellular location of yeast heat-shock protein 26 varies with metabolism.J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 425-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but no nuclear PQC degradation systems have been identified. Because there is no functional protein synthesis in the nucleus, the cell would not have to contend with production defects in the nucleus unless they eluded cytoplasmic PQC systems. Nuclear proteins can be damaged by the same stresses that damage proteins in other cellular compartments; thus, the cell must contend with aberrant proteins that arise within the nucleus. It is not clear if PQC degradation systems exist in the nucleus and, if so, whether they would be similar to those in other cellular compartments where protein synthesis occurs. Yet, similar to the protein synthetic compartments, accumulation of aberrant proteins in the nucleus can have deleterious effects. For example, aberrant protein accumulation in the nucleus likely underlies the pathology of Huntington’s disease (HD) and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) (Brais, 2003Brais B. Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy: a late-onset polyalanine disease.Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2003; 100: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, Jana and Nukina, 2003Jana N.R. Nukina N. Recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of polyglutamine diseases: involvement of molecular chaperones and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2003; 26: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). With a significant amount of regulated degradation occurring in the nucleus via ubiquitination and nuclear-localized proteasomes (Wojcik and DeMartino, 2003Wojcik C. DeMartino G.N. Intracellular localization of proteasomes.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), the nucleus certainly has the potential machinery for PQC degradation. In fact, nuclear aggregates of mutant polyglutamine- and polyalanine-expanded proteins in HD and OPMD, respectively, are ubiquitinated and associated with proteasome subunits (Abu-Baker et al., 2003Abu-Baker A. Messaed C. Laganiere J. Gaspar C. Brais B. Rouleau G.A. Involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and molecular chaperones in oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy.Hum. Mol.

Cell. 2001; 12: 1393-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), providing some evidence that PQC degradation systems may be operating in the nucleus. Given the potential importance of PQC degradation in the nucleus, we asked if such a system existed in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We searched for nuclear PQC degradation pathways in yeast working under the assumption that temperature-sensitive mutant nuclear proteins might be substrates for such a pathway. This idea was based on the observation that some temperature-sensitive proteins in other cellular compartments are recognized as aberrant and destroyed by PQC machinery, despite the fact that the mutant proteins often possess normal or near-normal activity (Betting and Seufert, 1996Betting J. Seufert W. A yeast Ubc9 mutant protein with temperature-sensitive in vivo function is subject to conditional proteolysis by a ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25790-25796Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, Bordallo et al., 1998Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Der3p/Hrd1p is required for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of misfolded lumenal and integral membrane proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In these cases, the temperature-sensitive phenotype results from reduced steady-state levels of the protein and can be suppressed by inhibiting the protein’s degradation, thus allowing the mutant protein to accumulate to functional levels (Bordallo et al., 1998Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Der3p/Hrd1p is required for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of misfolded lumenal and integral membrane proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). We speculated that if a general nuclear-localized PQC degradation system exists, then the temperature-sensitive phenotypes of different mutant nuclear proteins with disparate normal functions would be suppressed by a common extragenic mutation. We focused on temperature-sensitive alleles of nuclear protein genes that had been previously identified, particularly those for which suppressor analyses had been reported. From our search, we found two independently conducted genetic analyses: one targeting the sir4-9 allele (Schnell et al., 1989Schnell R. D’Ari L. Foss M. Goodman D. Rine J. Genetic and molecular characterization of suppressors of SIR4 mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 1989; 122: 29-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the other targeting the cdc68-1 allele (Xu et al., 1993Xu Q. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc68 transcription activator is antagonized by San1, a protein implicated in transcriptional silencing.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7553-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Both analyses identified mutations in the gene SAN1 that suppressed the respective temperature-sensitive phenotypes. SAN1 made an excellent candidate gene for a nuclear PQC degradation factor given the different nuclear functions of Sir4p, which is a structural component of silent chromatin at the silent mating-type loci and telomeres (Aparicio et al., 1991Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Gottschling D.E.

Herskowitz I. Four genes responsible for a position effect on expression from HML and HMR in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 1987; 116: 9-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Cdc68p, which facilitates DNA replication, transcriptional initiation, and elongation (Belotserkovskaya et al., 2003Belotserkovskaya R.

Spt16-Pob3 and the HMG protein Nhp6 combine to form the nucleosome-binding factor SPN.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3506-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In fact, the mutant Cdc68-1 protein was previously shown to be unstable compared to wild-type Cdc68p (Xu et al., 1995Xu Q. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Sug1 modulates yeast transcription activation by Cdc68.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6025-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and SAN1 was required for the mutant protein’s degradation (Evans et al., 1998Evans D.R. Brewster N.K. Xu Q. Rowley A. Altheim B.A. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. The yeast protein complex containing cdc68 and pob3 mediates core-promoter repression through the cdc68 N-terminal domain.Genetics. 1998; 150: 1393-1405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess San1p’s role in the QC degradation of mutant nuclear proteins, we first confirmed the SAN1 requirement for Cdc68-1p degradation (Figure 1A ). Next, we examined the stability of the mutant Sir4-9 protein and found that it too was degraded in a SAN1-dependent manner, whereas the wild-type version of Sir4p was stable in the presence of SAN1 (Figure 1B). Thus, mutations in both the Sir4 and Cdc68 proteins caused them to be rapidly degraded in the presence of SAN1, while their wild-type counterparts were stable. To facilitate additional genetic and biochemical assays, single Myc-tagged versions of wild-type Sir4p and the mutant Sir4-9p were created. While we found that N- or C-terminal addition of epitope sequences to Sir4p abrogated its silencing function and, in the case of N-terminal tags, resulted in aberrant degradation (data not shown), we found that conversion of the internal native sequence of Sir4p, 372EQKMKEDADL, to the highly similar c-Myc epitope sequence, EQKLISEEDL, had no effect on SIR4 silencing function (data not shown). Furthermore, overexpression of each internal Myc-tagged protein from the constitutive TDH3 promoter did not alter the stability of wild-type Sir4p or the SAN1-dependent degradation of mutant Sir4-9p (Figure 1C). We next determined if San1p’s degradative function was limited to the mutant Sir4-9 and Cdc68-1 proteins or if San1p acted more generally in aberrant nuclear protein degradation. To do so, we examined the stability of two other temperature-sensitive mutant nuclear proteins, Cdc13-1p and Sir3-8p. Detection of Cdc13 proteins was facilitated by the addition of a 9× Myc epitope sequence to the C terminus, which does not alter wild-type Cdc13p function (Qi and Zakian, 2000Qi H. Zakian V.A. The Saccharomyces telomere-binding protein Cdc13p interacts with both the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase alpha and the telomerase-associated est1 protein.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1777-1788PubMed Google Scholar). Detection of Sir3 proteins was facilitated by replacement of the wild-type Sir3p sequence, 426ETDNEMNGNGK, with the VSV epitope sequence, 426YTDIEMNRLGK, which had no effect on SIR3 silencing function (data not shown). Similar to the mutant Cdc68-1 and Sir4-9 proteins, the mutant Cdc13-1 and Sir3-8 proteins were rapidly degraded, and each was stabilized in the absence of SAN1 (Figures 1D and 1E, respectively). Cdc13-1p stabilization in san1Δ cells was complete, whereas Sir3-8p stabilization was partial. Both wild-type Cdc13p and Sir3p were stable in the presence of SAN1 (Figures 1D and 1E, respectively). Although the absence of SAN1 stabilized both Cdc13-1p and Sir3-8p, neither the cdc13-1 nor the sir3-8 temperature-sensitive phenotype was suppressed by the san1Δ allele (data not shown; Schnell et al., 1989Schnell R. D’Ari L. Foss M. Goodman D. Rine J. Genetic and molecular characterization of suppressors of SIR4 mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 1989; 122: 29-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This lack of phenotypic suppression contrasted with the san1Δ effect on the sir4-9 and cdc68-1 phenotypes (Schnell et al., 1989Schnell R. D’Ari L. Foss M. Goodman D. Rine J. Genetic and molecular characterization of suppressors of SIR4 mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 1989; 122: 29-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Xu et al., 1993Xu Q. Johnston G.C.

Biol. 1993; 13: 7553-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), indicating that the stabilized Cdc13-1 and Sir3-8 proteins are likely to be nonfunctional at the restrictive temperatures. Nevertheless, the fact that all four mutant proteins were aberrantly degraded in a SAN1-dependent manner is consistent with San1p functioning in nuclear PQC degradation. Analysis of its sequence revealed that San1p contained a variant version of the canonical RING domain (from residues 165–279; Figure 2A ), which is common among a subset of ubiquitin-protein ligases (Jackson et al., 2000Jackson P.K. Eldridge A.G. Freed E. Furstenthal L. Hsu J.Y. Kaiser B.K. Reimann J.D. The lore of the RINGs: substrate recognition and catalysis by ubiquitin ligases.Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). In San1p’s RING domain, the fifth canonical zinc binding His/Cys residue is replaced by Gly (Figure 2A). Because mutation of any of the conserved zinc binding Cys or His residues results in loss of activity in other ubiquitin-protein ligases tested (Bays et al., 2001Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Hrd1p/Der3p is a membrane-anchored ubiquitin ligase required for ER-associated degradation.Nat.

Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. RING fingers mediate ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2)-dependent ubiquitination.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar), the presence of a Gly residue in this position might be expected to disrupt RING domain structure and impair or prevent potential ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. To test San1p for ubiquitin-protein ligase activity, we used a standard in vitro autoubiquitination assay (Joazeiro et al., 1999Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. The tyrosine kinase negative regulator c-Cbl as a RING-type, E2-dependent ubiquitin-protein ligase.Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, Lorick et al., 1999Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. RING fingers mediate ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2)-dependent ubiquitination.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). The addition of a purified GST fusion of San1p to purified ubiquitin-activating enzyme, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, ubiquitin, and ATP resulted in autoubiquitination of GST-San1p (Figure 2B). This effect was not observed with GST alone or when any critical component of the reaction was excluded (Figure 2B). The activity was also RING domain dependent, as replacement of either Cys257 or Cys279 with Ser abolished the ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of the GST-San1p fusion (Figure 2C). Thus, San1p possessed in vitro RING-dependent ubiquitin-protein ligase activity, which is in agreement with recent findings (Dasgupta et al., 2004Dasgupta A. Ramsey K.L. Smith J.S. Auble D.T. Sir antagonist 1 (San1) is a ubiquitin ligase.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26830-26838Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Next, we assessed San1p activity in vivo by determining if one of its cellular substrates, Sir4-9p, was ubiquitinated in a San1p-dependent manner. Immunoprecipitates of Sir4-9p contained high molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates that increased dramatically after incubation at the nonpermissive temperature (Figure 2D), consistent with the temperature-sensitive degradation of Sir4-9p. Importantly, the ubiquitination of Sir4-9p required the presence of SAN1. Furthermore, SAN1-dependent ubiquitination was specific for only the mutant Sir4-9p, as the stable wild-type Sir4p showed no ubiquitination. Together, our in vivo and in vitro observations indicate that San1p is a ubiquitin-protein ligase that acts in the ubiquitination and degradation of aberrant nuclear proteins. It was evident that San1p was involved in the QC degradation of mutant nuclear proteins, but it was not clear if San1p carried out its function in the nucleus per se. Indeed, San1p resides in the nucleus, as evidenced by colocalization of GFP-tagged San1p with DAPI-stained nuclear DNA (Figure 3B ). By analyzing San1p’s sequence with PROSITE (http://au.expasy.org/prosite/), we found that San1p has a putative bipartite nuclear-localization sequence (NLS) from residues 182–199 (Figure 3A). In fact, the NLS was bona fide, as mutagenesis of the San1p NLS (Lys182Cys, Arg183Ser, Lys184Ala, Arg185Thr, Lys197Ser, Lys198Gln, Arg199Ser) resulted in predominantly cytoplasmic localization (Figure 3C). Although the NLS resides within a loop of the RING domain, RING domain structure was not critical for nuclear localization, as substitution of Cys257 or Cys279 with Ser had no effect on San1p-GFP nuclear localization (Figures 3E and 3F). Importantly, mislocalization of San1p by the NLS mutations abrogated the degradation of Sir4-9p and Cdc68-1p and suppressed the temperature sensitivity of cdc68-1 cells in a manner similar to that observed when SAN1 was deleted or the RING domain was mutated (Figure 4). However, the NLS-deficient San1p still retained normal ubiquitin-protein ligase activity in vitro (Figure 2C), indicating that mutation of the NLS did not adversely affect RING-domain activity. Curiously, the NLS mutations resulted in a slower mobility of San1p in SDS-PAGE gels (Figures 4A and 4B). It is not clear why this change occurred; perhaps the NLS-deficient San1 protein was subject to additional or new modifications that also interfered with San1p function. To rule out this possibility, we added the SV40 NLS onto the C terminus of the NLS-deficient San1p. This addition restored nuclear localization (Figure 3D) and in vivo degradation function (Figure 4), indicating that disruption of San1p nuclear localization by mutations to the endogenous NLS simply prevented San1p from gaining access to its nuclear substrates and did not alter another function of San1p. In addition to a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3), the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to substrates requires the action of two other enzymes: a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (UBA or E1), which forms a high-energy, thiol-ester bond with ubiquitin in a reaction that requires ATP, and a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC or E2), which accepts the charged ubiquitin from the activating enzyme by forming an identical, high-energy, thiol-ester bond with ubiquitin (Jackson et al., 2000Jackson P.K. Eldridge A.G. Freed E. Furstenthal L. Hsu J.Y. Kaiser B.K. Reimann J.D. The lore of the RINGs: substrate recognition and catalysis by ubiquitin ligases.Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae has a single essential UBA, Uba1p, and eleven UBCs, ten of which are not essential for viability (Jackson et al., 2000Jackson P.K. Eldridge A.G. Freed E. Furstenthal L. Hsu J.Y. Kaiser B.K. Reimann J.D. The lore of the RINGs: substrate recognition and catalysis by ubiquitin ligases.Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). To identify the UBC(s) participating in SAN1-mediated degradation, Sir4-9p degradation was examined in the absence of each nonessential UBC gene. ubc1Δ was the only single null allele that had a detectable effect on Sir4-9p degradation (Figure 5A ). However, loss of UBC1 resulted in partial stabilization of Sir4-9p, unlike the san1Δ allele, indicating that Ubc1p likely acts in concert with another UBC and San1p to ubiquitinate target proteins. Accumulation of Sir4-9p proteolytic fragments in ubc1Δ cells (Figure 5A, arrows) might indicate that Ubc1p activity is important in a processive aspect of SAN1-mediated degradation. The remaining untested UBC was CDC34/UBC3, which is a member of the SCF complex and is essential for yeast cells to progress through the cell cycle (Deshaies, 1999Deshaies R.J. SCF and Cullin/Ring H2-based ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). To assess a possible role of CDC34 in San1p-mediated degradation, we analyzed Sir4-9p degradation in a strain carrying the cdc34-2 allele (Liu et al., 1995Liu Y. Mathias N. Steussy C.N. Goebl M.G. Intragenic suppression among CDC34 (UBC3) mutations defines a class of ubiquitin-conjugating catalytic domains.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5635-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). When compared to a wild-type CDC34 strain, Sir4-9p was stable in the cdc34-2 strain (Figure 5B). Degradation was restored when the cdc34-2 allele was complemented by introduction of the wild-type CDC34 gene (Figure 5B), indicating that the cdc34-2 allele itself was responsible for Sir4-9p stability. We further tested the involvement of UBC1 and CDC34 in SAN1-mediated degradation by examining the effect of overexpressing catalytically inactive versions of each UBC on Sir4-9p degradation. Mutation of the active-site Cys residue in UBCs destroys their function, and overexpression of the mutant can dominantly interfere with the function of the wild-type cognate (Banerjee et al., 1995Banerjee A.

https://openalex.org/W2098214132,"A recently described form of synaptic plasticity results in dynamic changes in the calcium permeability of synaptic AMPA receptors. Since the AMPA receptor GluR2 subunit confers calcium permeability, this plasticity is thought to occur through the dynamic exchange of synaptic GluR2-lacking and GluR2-containing receptors. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this calcium-permeable AMPA receptor plasticity (CARP), we examined whether AMPA receptor exchange was mediated by subunit-specific protein-protein interactions. We found that two GluR2-interacting proteins, the PDZ domain-containing Protein interacting with C kinase (PICK1) and N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion protein (NSF), are specifically required for CARP. Furthermore, PICK1, but not NSF, regulates the formation of extrasynaptic plasma membrane pools of GluR2-containing receptors that may be laterally mobilized into synapses during CARP. These results demonstrate that PICK1 and NSF dynamically regulate the synaptic delivery of GluR2-containing receptors during CARP and thus regulate the calcium permeability of AMPA receptors at excitatory synapses."

We developed a system to provide controlled visual stimuli to larval zebrafish, while performing two-photon imaging of tectal neurons loaded with a fluorescent calcium indicator, allowing us to determine visual response properties in intact fish. In relatively mature larvae, we describe receptive field sizes, visual topography, and direction and size selectivity. We also characterize the onset and development of visual responses, beginning when retinal axons first arborize in the tectum. Surprisingly, most of these properties are established soon after dendrite growth and synaptogenesis begin and do not require patterned visual experience or a protracted period of refinement.

The end result of neural development is a set of synaptic connections that endow a neural circuit with specific functional properties. The retinotectal projection in fish and frogs has been a traditional system for studying this process (Baier et al., 1996Baier H. Klostermann S. Trowe T. Karlstrom R.O. Nusslein-Volhard C.

This well-defined mapping, combined with the experimental accessibility of these species, has led to a long history of experiments beginning with Sperry, 1963Sperry R.W. Chemoaffinity in the orderly growth of nerve fiber patterns and connections.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1963; 50: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar, which have elucidated the roles of both chemical gradients and synaptic activity in axonal and dendritic growth processes. Chemical gradients are believed to set up a coarse initial layout of the map, by specifying axonal arborization fields, while patterned synaptic activity could refine this initial mapping, by directly affecting axon and dendrite growth and/or via synaptic plasticity (Ruthazer and Cline, 2004Ruthazer E.S. Cline H.T. Insights into activity-dependent map formation from the retinotectal system: a middle-of-the-brain perspective.J. Neurobiol. 2004; 59: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). During this growth period, axonal and dendritic arbors are highly dynamic (Cline, 2001Cline H.T. Dendritic arbor development and synaptogenesis.Curr. Opin.

While a number of studies have addressed the morphological establishment of the retinotectal projection (O'Rourke and Fraser, 1986O'Rourke N.A. Fraser S.E.

Poo M. Visual input induces long-term potentiation of developing retinotectal synapses.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 708-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), rather than visual receptive fields. Thus, it is not well understood how the extended period of activity-dependent morphological rearrangements corresponds with visual response properties of the recipient tectal neurons, which serve as the readout of the retinotectal pathway. In fact, the retinotectal projection can serve as a valuable system to study the functional maturation of neural circuits in general. Because the time courses of axon and dendrite growth as well as synaptogenesis have been characterized, the tectum provides an opportunity to correlate the structural establishment of connectivity with the development of specific functional response properties. For instance, how long after initial connectivity is established do neurons become active? What are the first properties to develop? How specific are the initial synaptic connections, and how do receptive field characteristics mature as the dendritic arbor grows and more synapses are formed? Furthermore, understanding how visual properties arise developmentally may provide insight into how they are computed by the circuit. The zebrafish is particularly amenable to these studies, as the larvae are transparent and the visual system develops rapidly. Retinal axons begin arborizing in the tectum approximately 60 hr postfertilization (hpf) (Stuermer, 1988Stuermer C.A. Retinotopic organization of the developing retinotectal projection in the zebrafish embryo.J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 4513-4530PubMed Google Scholar), and tectal neuron dendrite growth and synaptogenesis begin around 3 days postfertilization (dpf), continuing through approximately 7 dpf (Niell et al., 2004Niell C.M. Meyer M.P. Smith S.J. In vivo imaging of synapse formation on a growing dendritic arbor.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The first visual behaviors, the startle response and tracking eye movements, begin at 3 dpf (Easter and Nicola, 1996Easter Jr., S.S. Nicola G.N. The development of vision in the zebrafish (Danio rerio).Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 646-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), and by 5 dpf zebrafish begin to hunt prey (Westerfield, 1993Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. Institute of Neuroscience, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR1993Google Scholar). In order to measure visual responses in large populations of tectal neurons during development, we injected the tectum of larval zebrafish with a fluorescent calcium indicator. We then presented controlled visual stimuli to restrained nonanesthetized larvae via a miniature LCD screen, while performing two-photon imaging of cell bodies in the tectum to measure the calcium response. This allowed us to determine receptive field properties, such as visual topography, receptive field width, and direction and size selectivity. We determined the time course of the development of these properties beginning when retinal axons first arborize in the tectum and found that the retinotopic map of the visual field, as well as receptive field diameter and direction selectivity, are close to their mature values soon after visual response begins, at a stage when tectal dendrites have still only formed a small number of synapses. These properties are not dependent on patterned visual experience, as this rapid establishment proceeds normally in larvae raised in darkness. Thus, although extensive axon and dendrite growth and remodeling continue for several more days, we find that there is little evidence for an extended period of receptive field refinement and that, instead, most response properties are well determined from the outset of development. Fluorescent indicators of cytosolic calcium concentration can provide an indirect measure of neuronal activity over populations of neurons (Fetcho et al., 1998Fetcho J.R. Cox K.J. O'Malley D.M. Monitoring activity in neuronal populations with single-cell resolution in a behaving vertebrate.Histochem. J. 1998; 30: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Injection of OGB1-AM into the tectum of zebrafish larvae resulted in labeling of a substantial number of cell bodies in one hemisphere, primarily in the periventricular cell body layer (Figures 1B and 1C ). A small number of cell bodies were also labeled in the neuropil layer, as well as a significant background labeling of the neuropil itself, but individual axons and dendrites could not be resolved. We focused our analysis on the periventricular neurons, since they are the most numerous cell type in the tectum, and their morphological development had been previously characterized. No impairment of the larvae’s health or behavior was observed following injections. Unanesthetized labeled zebrafish were restrained in agarose in an imaging chamber that allowed simultaneous two-photon imaging and presentation of visual stimuli to the contralateral eye using the image of a miniature LCD screen projected onto the side of the chamber (Figure 1A). Visual stimuli resulted in significant increases in fluorescence in a subset of neurons (Figures 1D–1F and see Movie S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). These responses were reproducible and stimulus specific. The time course of the fluorescence signal was measured by performing a line scan across individual neurons during stimulus presentation. As shown in Figure 2A , there was a rapid rise in fluorescence within 100 ms of stimulus onset, followed by a slow decay with a time constant of approximately 1 s. Images were acquired by alternating stimulus presentation and control frames, at 4 s intervals to allow complete recovery of the fluorescence signal between frames. The response for each neuron was measured by calculating mean fluorescence intensity in a region of interest centered on each neuron that was clearly resolved in the field of view. The changes in fluorescence intensity for four neurons that were elicited by a set of stimuli are shown in Figure 2B. The set of stimuli in frames 1 to 30, spots sweeping through different locations in visual space, is repeated in frames 31 to 60. Each neuron responded reproducibly to a particular combination of stimuli. In order to verify that calcium transients are related to action potentials in the tectal neurons, we injected tetrodotoxin into the eyecup, which eliminated both spontaneous and stimulus-evoked calcium transients (Figure 2C.) We also performed simultaneous extracellular loose-patch recording and calcium imaging during visual stimulation. Figure 2D shows that visual stimuli evoked a burst of action potentials, which was correlated with increases in the fluorescence level. The correspondence between number of spikes fired and the magnitude of the fluorescence transient for a typical neuron is shown in Figure 2E, which demonstrates that the relationship was monotonic and approximately linear and that responses to stimuli evoking only a few spikes could be reliably detected. Furthermore, this relationship is consistent across neurons and ages (Figure 2F.) We initially characterized visual responses in relatively mature 9 dpf fish. At this stage, dendrite growth, axon rearrangements, and synapse formation have significantly decreased relative to the early period of growth from 3 to 7 dpf, resulting in stable tectal neuron morphology (Niell et al., 2004Niell C.M. Meyer M.P. Smith S.J. In vivo imaging of synapse formation on a growing dendritic arbor.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We first calculated the region of visual space that a given neuron responded to, i.e., the spatial receptive field, by multiplying fluorescence responses to 12° moving spots sweeping completely across x and y coordinates of the visual field for each given neuron (Figure 3A ). This proved more effective than white noise reverse correlation as a result of the limited number of stimulus presentations due to photobleaching and the long time course of the calcium response, and the nonlinearity in response properties due to the fact that many neurons responded to both light and dark stimuli. Figure 3B shows the spatial receptive fields to moving spots for all neurons in the field of view, demonstrating that, while many neurons did not respond at all to these stimuli, many others demonstrated a strong response that was localized to a subregion of visual space. The diameters of the receptive fields were relatively large, as shown in Figure 3C, ranging from 12° to nearly the entire field of visual presentation, with a mean of 40° ± 4° (n = 588 cells in 12 fish). Figure S1 shows enlarged examples of such receptive fields with different diameters, amplitudes, and spatial locations. Close inspection of Figure 3C shows that cells at the rostral end of the tectum generally responded to the anterior portion of the visual field, while cells at the caudal end responded to posteriorly located stimuli. This is demonstrated explicitly in Figure 3D, which maps the x coordinate center of a parametric fit to each individual receptive field, revealing the rostrocaudal/anterior-posterior visuotopic map in the tectum, which has been well characterized morphologically in terms of the projection pattern of retinal ganglion cell axons within the tectum (Baier et al., 1996Baier H. Klostermann S. Trowe T. Karlstrom R.O. Nusslein-Volhard C. Bonhoeffer F. Genetic dissection of the retinotectal projection.Development. 1996; 123: 415-425PubMed Google Scholar). Figure 3E shows the relation between cell body position and receptive field center, demonstrating a strong correlation, which was consistent across all fish (mean c = 0.79 ± 0.05 slope = 0.85 ± 0.1°/μm; n = 588 cells, 12 fish). A corresponding map of the up/down visual axis is represented in depth, perpendicular to the image plane, and thus was not generally detected in a single section, but could be observed by focusing down through the specimen (data not shown). By subtracting sweeps in opposite directions, we were able to calculate a value for direction selectivity at each visual coordinate, for neurons that responded to moving stimuli. An example of a direction-selective neuron is shown in Figure 4A , demonstrating that such cells display normal receptive fields, but with significantly stronger responses in one preferred direction and suppressed response in the opposite direction. The direction selectivity was vector averaged across the visual field, and the resulting vector magnitude was used as the direction selectivity index (DSI) for the neuron. As Figure 4B (blue) shows, nearly 50% of motion-responsive neurons had a DSI > 0.33, corresponding to a 2:1 direction preference, which is a standard criterion for direction selectivity. To rule out the possibility that this selectivity was due to trial-to-trial variability in the response, we calculated the DSI using shuffled data, where presentation of stimuli in opposite, rather than identical, directions were pooled and averaged. Figure 4B (red) shows that for shuffled data almost no neurons had a DSI > 0.33. Figure 4C shows the preferred direction for all direction-selective neurons in one fish. In the region of the tectum representing the center of visual space, all directions were represented nearly equally with little indication of spatial organization. However, in the caudal tectum, which represents the posterior visual field, there was some predominance of selectivity for anterior motion, i.e., an object moving into the visual field. This is corroborated in Figure 4D, the preferred angle for all neurons, which shows that all directions were present, but with a preponderance of anterior-directed motion. Studies in both the tectum of fish and superior colliculus of higher vertebrates have demonstrated a size selectivity, or negative spatial summation, wherein neurons respond optimally to objects smaller than the receptive field size and decrease their response to larger or multiple objects even within the region that would normally elicit a positive response (Vanegas, 1984Vanegas H. Comparative Neurology of the Optic Tectum. Plenum Press, New York1984Crossref Google Scholar). We tested this for zebrafish periventricular neurons by flashing stationary spots of varying size in the center of the visual field. Figure 4E demonstrates this size selectivity, as most cells responded maximally to squares of just 6° across, with almost no response to objects 50° across, which was a typical receptive field size as shown in Figure 3B. Thus, although tectal cells were responsive to objects moving anywhere within a relatively large region of visual space, they could show selectivity for the size and direction of stimuli. Although the above results illustrate the properties of neurons that responded to moving stimuli, Figure 3A shows that many neurons did not respond to these stimuli. We therefore presented a battery of different stimuli to fish (see Experimental Procedures), including the 12° moving spots and flashing spots of different sizes in the visual field center, both described above; flashing spots at all spatial positions; gratings of various spatial frequencies; full-field arrays of spots of 6° or 25°, both stationary and moving; an expanding spot to simulate a looming object; and sustained changes in background intensity. Figure 5A represents the responses of all neurons with cell bodies centrally located in the visuotopic map. Because of the large amount of data, a cluster analysis algorithm was used to sort neurons into groups with similar response properties across multiple stimuli. Although there was some variability within each group, setting a threshold of 0.5 within-cluster correlation resulted in five major clusters. Approximately 5% of neurons fell into groups of less than 1% of the total population and were thus left as unclassified. Summarizing the data by the mean response of each cluster allows some data reduction without eliminating all heterogeneity, as shown in Figure 5B, which also demonstrates that responses to measurements that were not included in the clustering (below the dashed line) also segregate with this clustering. In general, we would not argue that these groups have clear-cut boundaries but that they serve as a method to categorize response types. The first group corresponds to neurons that had strong receptive fields as mapped by moving stimuli and were direction selective, while group 2 was similar but with little direction selectivity. Group 3 showed low response to the moving spot stimuli but responded strongly to flashing or stationary spots, with less size selectivity and spatial summation than motion-responsive cells. A fourth group was characterized by sustained spontaneous activity in the dark and responded to other stimuli only inasmuch as they created a sustained decrease in total illumination. Interestingly, they did not respond to transient full-field decreases (flicker) but only to sustained darkness of at least several hundred milliseconds. Finally, a sizeable population of cells did not respond significantly to any of the stimuli we presented. These may represent glia or other nonexcitable cells, or neurons for which we have not found a suitable stimulus. In order to characterize the initial establishment of receptive field properties of tectal neurons, we used the same battery of stimuli to probe visual responses starting at 60 hpf, when retinal axons have just begun entering the tectal neuropil. The cluster analysis, which was verified at 9 dpf (Figure 6F ), was used to provide a concise description of the range of tectal responses. The cluster analysis was performed independently for each time point, but always using the same parameters for calculating the correlation between neurons. Summarizing the data by the mean response of each cluster allowed some data reduction without eliminating all heterogeneity. At 60 hpf, no spontaneous or visually evoked responses could be measured. Beginning at 66 hpf (Figure 6B), we observed responses to large dark stimuli, as well as spontaneous activity in darkness, in a small number of neurons, but no spatial receptive fields could be measured. At 72 hpf, when the lens forms a focused image on the retina (Easter and Nicola, 1996Easter Jr., S.S. Nicola G.N. The development of vision in the zebrafish (Danio rerio).Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 646-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), over 50% of neurons responded to visual stimuli. As Figure 6C shows, these responses grouped into two of the same clusters that were apparent in the mature neurons, although generally the responses were much weaker. By 78 and 84 hpf (Figures 6D and 6E), the four main response types were present in nearly the mature proportions, and most aspects of their selectivity were apparent, despite the fact that dendritic arbor length, as well as the number of synapses per neuron, are a small fraction of their mature values (Niell et al., 2004Niell C.M. Meyer M.P. Smith S.J. In vivo imaging of synapse formation on a growing dendritic arbor.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Other properties that are not dependent on the cluster analysis also developed quite rapidly. Figure 7A shows a typical map of receptive fields for an 84 hpf larva, demonstrating that the layout of receptive fields was already quite similar to that at 9 dpf. A map of anterior-posterior receptive field center (Figure 7B) shows that visual topography was already well established. In fact, using the correlation coefficient between cell body location and receptive field center as a measure of topography (Figure 7C) demonstrated that by 78 hpf the smoothness of the retinotopic map was indistinguishable from that of a mature map. Furthermore, the average receptive field width shows that although receptive fields were somewhat smaller at 72 hpf, their size did not change considerably after 78 hpf (Figure 7C). These results suggest that the continued rearrangement of retinal axons does not result in either a smoothing of the retinotectal map or more spatially restricted receptive fields. The two primary aspects of response selectivity observed in mature neurons, direction and size selectivity, were also established at this early stage of development. Figure 7D shows that by the time spatial receptive fields could be mapped with moving spots, a significant fraction already showed direction selectivity, which gradually increased to near the mature value by 84 hpf. Likewise, although neurons at 72 hpf still responded to large (>25°) stimuli (Figure 7E), by 78 hpf the neuronal responses were restricted to stimuli much smaller than the total receptive field size. The most apparent change from the initial period of receptive field establishment to the mature responses described above was simply the magnitude of the response, or the sensitivity, rather than the selectivity. However, one aspect of selectivity that did improve during the period of dendritic maturation was the response to the smallest stimuli. Figure 7E demonstrates that neurons at 84 hpf responded much less to 6° spots than 12° spots, and not at all to 3° spots. Similarly, comparison of Figures 6D and 6E shows that one of the primary characteristics of the non-motion-responsive cluster 3, the strong response to a full field of 6° spots, was not present at 84 hpf. These changes are all summarized in Figure 7F, which shows the responses to these stimuli normalized to their mature values at 9 dpf, demonstrating that responses to smaller stimuli are less developed by 84 hpf than larger stimuli. The short time course for establishment of these properties suggests that patterned visual experience may not be necessary. In order to test this, we raised larvae in the dark up to 84 hpf and compared them with age-matched controls. Figure 8A demonstrates that dark-reared fish develop the normal degree of retinotopy with appropriate receptive field diameters. Furthermore, direction selectivity arises in a similar proportion of neurons in the absence of moving stimuli (Figure 8B). Again, spatial acuity seems to be the only aspect that is affected, as the response to small flashing spots is somewhat decreased (Figure 8C), although these weaker stimuli could be affected by retinal adaptation to the dark rearing. By integrating two-photon calcium imaging with a mechanism to provide controlled high-resolution visual stimuli to awake restrained larva, we have developed a method to rapidly determine response properties of populations of neurons in vivo during development. This method has several advantages over traditional electrophysiological techniques. After the initial injection of indicator, which can be performed a significant distance from the recording site and with no noticeable effect on the larvae, the procedure is essentially noninvasive. It also allows access to neurons which would be difficult to reach or isolate with electrodes, such as the closely packed periventricular neurons studied here. We can also study these neurons earlier in development than was possible before, allowing us to study the initial onset of visual responses. Furthermore, imaging allows the acquisition of data from hundreds of neurons simultaneously, resulting in high throughput, which allowed us to perform cluster analysis on a large sample size, as well as giving information about the spatial distribution and topography. Finally, recordings can be maintained for an extended period of time, often 6 hr or more, limited primarily by gradual elimination of the indicator and cellular rearrangements during periods of rapid growth. This technique could be particularly valuable for the zebrafish, which is rapidly becoming a model organism for visual function and development. A number of retinorecipient areas of mostly unknown function have been identified (Burrill and Easter, 1994Burrill J.D. Easter Jr., S.S. Development of the retinofugal projections in the embryonic and larval zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio).J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 346: 583-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and this method could provide a means to map out their response properties. Likewise, mutants in various aspects of the visual system, from photoreceptor properties to wiring deficits, as well as behavioral mutants of unknown neurological basis, have been identified (Baier, 2000Baier H. Zebrafish on the move: towards a behavior-genetic analysis of vertebrate vision.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In vivo imaging could help us understand the specific defects in neural function that accompany these mutations. Despite the fact that the fish retinotectal projection and the outgrowth of the corresponding tectal cell dendrites are model systems for the development of neural circuitry, remarkably little is known about the functional aspects of this circuit. Even in the adult, the single-unit visual response properties of periventricular neurons, which make up over 95% of all neurons in the fish tectum, have not been well characterized except for two studies by Sajovic and Levinthal (Sajovic and Levinthal, 1982aSajovic P.

https://openalex.org/W1980607613,"It has been debated whether asymmetric distribution of cell surface receptors during mitosis could generate asymmetric cell divisions by yielding daughters with different environmental responsiveness and, thus, different fates. We have found that in mouse embryonic forebrain ventricular and subventricular zones, the EGFR can distribute asymmetrically during mitosis in vivo and in vitro. This occurs during divisions yielding two Nestin+ progenitor cells, via an actin-dependent mechanism. The resulting sibling progenitor cells respond differently to EGFR ligand in terms of migration and proliferation. Moreover, they express different phenotypic markers: the EGFRhigh daughter usually has radial glial/astrocytic markers, while its EGFRlow sister lacks them, indicating fate divergence. Lineage trees of cultured cortical glioblasts reveal repeated EGFR asymmetric distribution, and asymmetric divisions underlie formation of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in clones.

Asymmetric cell division, in which unequal distribution of determinants during mitosis results in two daughter cells with different fates, is a fundamental mechanism underlying the generation of neural cell diversity. In invertebrates and, more recently, in mammals, multipotent neuroblasts and neural stem cells have been observed to undergo repeated asymmetric cell divisions in which one daughter cell is a restricted neuroblast, while the other retains progenitor cell identity (Doe and Skeath, 1996Doe C.Q.

In Drosophila, as neuroepithelial cells delaminate and form neuroblasts, a protein complex that includes Bazooka, DmPar-6, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), and the G protein subunit Gαi forms a crescent on the apical side. When neuroblasts divide, this complex directs Prospero (pros), Numb, and prosRNA, with their adaptors, Miranda, Partner of Numb, and Staufen, respectively, to the basal pole. With the coordination of oriented cleavage planes, these basally localized asymmetric determinants are segregated preferentially into the basal daughter (ganglion mother cell). Functional analyses of these asymmetric cell determinants with genetic approaches have revealed their key roles in binary cell fate choices; for instance, loss of Numb eliminates asymmetric fates (Buescher et al., 1998Buescher M. Yeo S.L. Udolph G. Zavortink M. Yang X. Tear G. Chia W.

Kopczynski C. Goodman C.S. Doe C.Q. Asymmetric localization of numb autonomously determines sibling neuron identity in the Drosophila CNS.Development. 1995; 121: 3489-3494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Much of this intracellular asymmetric machinery is conserved in vertebrate neural development. ASIP, the mouse homolog of Bazooka, with mPAR-6 and aPKC localizes at the apical side of mouse neuroepithelial cells (Manabe et al., 2002Manabe N. Hirai S. Imai F. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. Ohno S.

Mouse Numb shows asymmetric distribution at cortical neural progenitor/stem cell divisions during neurogenesis (Shen et al., 2002Shen Q. Zhong W. Jan Y.N. Temple S.

Asymmetric Numb distribution is critical for asymmetric cell division of mouse cerebral cortical stem cells and neuroblasts.Development. 2002; 129: 4843-4853PubMed Google Scholar). These asymmetric determinants act via regulation of specific intracellular signaling pathways. Numb downregulates Notch signaling, blocking nuclear transport of the activated form of Notch. Thus, the daughter cell that inherits Numb has a lower level of Notch signaling (Berdnik et al., 2002Berdnik D. Torok T. Gonzalez-Gaitan M. Knoblich J.A. The endocytic protein alpha-Adaptin is required for numb-mediated asymmetric cell division in Drosophila.Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), which in turn directs the cell fate choice. In this way, two sibling cells can have equal Notch expression on the cell surface and be exposed to equivalent ligand, but show unequal Notch signaling. It has been debated whether asymmetric cell division can also occur at the cell surface receptor level, directly leading to unequal signaling between sibling cells. Numb can stimulate Notch endocytosis in Drosophila, and it has been suggested that this could clear receptors from one sibling cell (Berdnik et al., 2002Berdnik D. Torok T. Gonzalez-Gaitan M. Knoblich J.A. The endocytic protein alpha-Adaptin is required for numb-mediated asymmetric cell division in Drosophila.Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, unequal Notch has been described on ferret cortical neuroepithelial cells (Chenn and McConnell, 1995Chenn A. McConnell S.K. Cleavage orientation and the asymmetric inheritance of Notch1 immunoreactivity in mammalian neurogenesis.Cell. 1995; 82: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), but this result was not confirmed in mouse (Zhong et al., 1997Zhong W. Jiang M.M. Weinmaster G. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Differential expression of mammalian Numb, Numblike and Notch1 suggests distinct roles during mouse cortical neurogenesis.Development. 1997; 124: 1887-1897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); unequal Notch distribution remains an intriguing possibility for asymmetric neural cell division. While in Drosophila asymmetric neural cell divisions are largely dependent on Numb, and all known Numb functions act via the Notch pathway, in vertebrates this may not be the only receptor system that can generate asymmetric cell divisions. Many environmental signals are indispensable for aspects of neural cell fate determination, such as progenitor/stem cell maintenance and neuronal and glial differentiation. Murine neural stem cell proliferation can be stimulated by fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling. Moreover, EGF receptor (EGFR), a member of the tyrosine kinase receptor family, can influence cortical progenitor fate choice, as its overexpression at midgestation pushes cells into the astrocyte lineage at the expense of neuron formation (Burrows et al., 1997Burrows R.C. Wancio D. Levitt P. Lillien L. Response diversity and the timing of progenitor cell maturation are regulated by developmental changes in EGFR expression in the cortex.Neuron. 1997; 19: 251-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, Caric et al., 2001Caric D. Raphael H. Viti J. Feathers A. Wancio D. Lillien L. EGFRs mediate chemotactic migration in the developing telencephalon.Development. 2001; 128: 4203-4216PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, we decided to examine how EGFRs might be distributed during mitoses of cortical progenitor cells. EGFR expression is upregulated at midgestation, and EGFR activation in late progenitor cells stimulates cell proliferation, migration, and astrocyte differentiation (Burrows et al., 1997Burrows R.C. Wancio D. Levitt P. Lillien L. Response diversity and the timing of progenitor cell maturation are regulated by developmental changes in EGFR expression in the cortex.Neuron. 1997; 19: 251-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We examined EGFR distribution during and after progenitor cell divisions in vivo and in clonal cultures, allowing us to follow the progeny of individual cells in order to determine their fate. Interestingly, we found that a subpopulation of forebrain progenitor cells shows asymmetric EGFR distribution at late stages of mitosis, resulting in different levels of EGFR on daughter cells and subsequent differences in their behavior. Our study provides evidence that asymmetric EGFR distribution acts as a mechanism for generating asymmetric neural cell divisions. As shown previously (Caric et al., 2001Caric D. Raphael H. Viti J. Feathers A. Wancio D. Lillien L. EGFRs mediate chemotactic migration in the developing telencephalon.Development. 2001; 128: 4203-4216PubMed Google Scholar), EGFR expression in cortex varies temporally, being low prior to embryonic day 13 (E13), and regionally, being higher in lateral than in medial cortex. It also varies within laminae: from E13–15, EGFR is exclusively localized in ventricular (VZ) and subventricular zones (SVZ), and, starting from E16, its expression is most intense in subplate and marginal layers, with more diffuse staining in the intermediate zone and cortical plate. EGFR staining is stronger in basal than in dorsal embryonic forebrain. We found that EGFR appears concentrated at the luminal surface of the VZ (Figures 1A–1C )—at low levels from E13–14—but more marked at E15–17, when cells also began to show clear membrane localization of EGFR. We focused on dividing cells, identifying mitotic cells by their condensed chromosome/chromatid morphology revealed by chromosome staining. Mitoses were found mostly in the VZ; fewer were found in the SVZ and intermediate zone, and a few were dispersed in the cortical plate. Most dividing cortical cells have EGFR distributed evenly over the entire cell membrane or show no expression at all (Figures 1M–1O). However, some dividing cortical progenitor cells show EGFR asymmetrically localized to one side (Figures 1D–1L and Movies S1 and S2 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). In 21 E17 brain sections, a total of 217 dividing cortical progenitor cells, from metaphase to telophase, were examined; 111 were EGFR+ and 24 (21.6%) of these showed asymmetric distribution. Of these 24 mitotic progenitor cells, 16 were in the VZ and 7 were in the SVZ (1 was in the lateral migratory stream); 21 cells were at anaphase/telophase and 3 were at metaphase. Cortical cleavage planes can vary from perpendicular or parallel with respect to the ventricular surface (Chenn and McConnell, 1995Chenn A. McConnell S.K. Cleavage orientation and the asymmetric inheritance of Notch1 immunoreactivity in mammalian neurogenesis.Cell. 1995; 82: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, Haydar et al., 2003Haydar T.F. Ang Jr., E. Rakic P. Mitotic spindle rotation and mode of cell division in the developing telencephalon.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 2890-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). For VZ cells with asymmetric EGFR, there was a change during development from predominantly parallel cleavage planes at E14–E15 (6/9 [67%]) to predominantly perpendicular at E17 (14/16 [87%]), mirroring a similar change in plane orientation described for the general dividing cell population (Haydar et al., 2003Haydar T.F. Ang Jr., E. Rakic P. Mitotic spindle rotation and mode of cell division in the developing telencephalon.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 2890-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In the SVZ, dividing cells usually had cleavage planes perpendicular with respect to the nearby ventricular surface. To determine if asymmetric EGFR distribution during mitosis can indeed lead to daughter cells with different EGFR levels, we used a pair assay (Shen et al., 2002Shen Q. Zhong W. Jan Y.N. Temple S. Asymmetric Numb distribution is critical for asymmetric cell division of mouse cerebral cortical stem cells and neuroblasts.Development. 2002; 129: 4843-4853PubMed Google Scholar) in which the progeny of each division can be followed. Single E13–E17 cortical cells were plated into culture wells at low density in serum-free medium containing 10 ng/ml FGF2 (this medium was used throughout these studies, unless stated otherwise) and mapped to determine their location. For studies of E15–E17 cortex, we enriched the minor progenitor population, using the surface marker LeX (Capela and Temple, 2002Capela A. Temple S. LeX/ssea-1 is expressed by adult mouse CNS stem cells, identifying them as nonependymal.Neuron. 2002; 35: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), via magnetic bead sorting (MACS). After 24 hr, pairs of daughter cells were identified, then fixed, and stained for EGFR. In some pairs, one daughter cell had EGFR expression (EGFRhigh), but the other (EGFRlow) did not (Figure 2A ). The frequency of these pairs with asymmetric EGFR staining decreased with developmental stage: 26.7% ± 5.4% at E13 and 17.8% ± 1.7% at E17 (Student’s t test, p < 0.001; Figure 2B). Some cortical progenitor cells that were observed in mitosis had asymmetric EGFR distribution, usually at telophase and cytokinesis, as we saw in vivo (Figure 2C and Table 1). We did not observe any asymmetric EGFR during metaphase in culture, unlike in vivo; this discrepancy may be explained by loss of contact with neighboring cells. The frequency of EGFR asymmetric distribution at telophase and cytokinesis in E15–16 dividing cells was 38.8%, while 23.1% of the resulting pairs had asymmetric EGFR. Thus, the initial asymmetric EGFR distribution is lost in some pairs; for example, the EGFRlow daughter may reexpress EGFR after mitosis, as occurs with Numb expression in Drosophila neuroblasts. EGFR asymmetry was also observed when cells were grown in serum-free medium containing EGF rather than FGF2 (17.3% of dividing E17 cortical pairs in EGF were asymmetric for EGFR, compared to 17.9% in FGF2).Table 1E15–E16 Cortical Dividing Cells with Asymmetric EGFR In VitroMitosis StageIncidence of EGFR Asymmetric DistributionTotal Dividing CellsMetaphase019Anaphase9.1%22Telophase & cytokinesis38.8%67EGFR asymmetric distribution is most prominent at late stages of mitosis. Open table in a new tab EGFR asymmetric distribution is most prominent at late stages of mitosis. To confirm the asymmetric distribution of EGFR with an independent method, we used a plasmid construct containing EGFR fused with enhanced GFP (eGFP) at the C-terminal region (p-eGFP-N1-hEGFR; Carter and Sorkin, 1998Carter R.E. Sorkin A. Endocytosis of functional epidermal growth factor receptor-green fluorescent protein chimera.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35000-35007Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) to transfect freshly isolated E12–E13 cortical progenitor cells. Approximately 24 to 48 hr posttransfection, 2%–3% of cells expressed detectable hEGFR-eGFP protein, mostly at low levels and in the cell membrane, similar to endogenous EGFR (Figure 2D). Of 20 dividing cortical progenitor cells that were followed, 2 (10%) showed asymmetric eGFP distribution during cell division (Figure 2D). We also confirmed this result using a ligand-labeling strategy. Fluorescently conjugated EGF binds to EGFRs, and the resulting internalized complex can be visualized (Carter and Sorkin, 1998Carter R.E. Sorkin A. Endocytosis of functional epidermal growth factor receptor-green fluorescent protein chimera.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35000-35007Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). After cortical progenitor cells had generated pairs of daughter cells, Alexa488-conjugated EGF was added to the culture medium for 5–10 min. The pairs were then fixed and stained for EGFR. There was a high correlation between asymmetry in internalized Alexa488-conjugated EGF and EGFR staining (Figures 2E and 2F; Student’s t test and χ2 analysis: p < 0.01). In summary, both the hEGFR-eGFP fusion construct and Alexa488-conjugated EGF ligand-labeling experiments confirmed that EGFR is asymmetrically distributed during mouse cortical progenitor cell divisions. We then assessed whether differential distribution of EGFR resulted in a functional difference between daughter cells. EGFR signaling can stimulate proliferation and migration of neural cells (Burrows et al., 1997Burrows R.C. Wancio D. Levitt P. Lillien L. Response diversity and the timing of progenitor cell maturation are regulated by developmental changes in EGFR expression in the cortex.Neuron. 1997; 19: 251-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, Caric et al., 2001Caric D. Raphael H. Viti J. Feathers A. Wancio D. Lillien L. EGFRs mediate chemotactic migration in the developing telencephalon.Development. 2001; 128: 4203-4216PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, we assessed EGF-driven BrdU incorporation and migration in these cell pairs. Single E15–16 cells were plated in medium containing 20 ng/ml EGF with no FGF2 (to exclude interference with FGFR signaling) for 24 hr. The resulting cell pairs were mapped, 10 μg/ml BrdU were added, and 8 hr later, the pairs were fixed and stained for EGFR. In pairs with asymmetric EGFR, the EGFRhigh daughter cell had a significantly higher frequency of BrdU incorporation than its EGFRlow sibling (Figures 3A and 3B; χ2 analysis, Student’s t test, p < 0.01). However, when these cortical progenitor pairs were grown in medium containing both FGF2 and EGF, EGFRhigh and EGFRlow daughter cells incorporated BrdU at a similar frequency (data not shown), showing that the correlation between EGFR expression and BrdU incorporation in these asymmetric pairs is ligand dependent. Thus, progenitor siblings can have asymmetric EGFR while being symmetrically responsive to FGF2, and, consistent with this, double-staining reveals pairs asymmetric for EGFR, while both cells of the pair have FGFR2 (Figure 3F). To measure the migration of each daughter cell, we generated pairs from E17 LeX-enriched cortical progenitor cells, as described above, photographed them to map their initial position, and then rephotographed them after an additional 8 or 16 hr of culture. The distance between the initial and final position seen in the overlaid images (Figure 3C) was then determined. (Pairs that divided again during the observation period were excluded, because cells usually stop migrating during mitosis.) We noticed that the two daughter cells usually migrated together initially and later separated. Migration ability varies from pair to pair, but EGFRhigh daughter cells consistently migrated farther in this assay than did their sibling EGFRlow cells in EGF-containing medium (Figure 3D; paired t test, p < 0.05). We examined the relationship between EGFR distribution and that of a well-established asymmetric determinant, Numb. Numb has a PTB binding domain that would allow it to associate with EGFR; however, no direct association between EGFR and Numb has been found (Dho et al., 1998Dho S.E. Jacob S. Wolting C.D. French M.B. Rohrschneider L.R. McGlade C.J. The mammalian numb phosphotyrosine-binding domain. Characterization of binding specificity and identification of a novel PDZ domain-containing numb binding protein, LNX.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9179-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it was important to determine whether there was a correlation between Numb and EGFR distribution in these cortical cells. When we double-stained EGFRhigh/EGFRlow E13 cortical pairs with Numb antibody, we found that most, 76%, were also asymmetric for Numb. Moreover, Numb colocalized with EGFR, being found in the EGFRhigh daughter, while the EGFRlow daughter was usually negative for Numb (Figures 4A and 4B). However, this correlation decreased at E16–17, at which stage pairs asymmetric for EGFR are mostly (74%) symmetric for Numb (Figures 4A and 4B ). To find out whether the EGFR distribution might be dependent on Numb asymmetry, we compared the frequency of EGFR asymmetric pairs from dorsal forebrain in wild-type and Emx1IREScre Numb and Numblike double mutant mice (Li et al., 2003Li H.S. Wang D. Shen Q. Schonemann M.D. Gorski J.A. Jones K.R. Temple S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Inactivation of Numb and Numblike in embryonic dorsal forebrain impairs neurogenesis and disrupts cortical morphogenesis.Neuron. 2003; 40: 1105-1118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and found no significant difference (Figure 4C). Thus, EGFR asymmetry is not dependent on the presence of Numb. In Drosophila, the asymmetric distribution of Numb and Prospero are actin-dependent processes. We tested the effect of disrupting the actin cytoskeleton on EGFR asymmetric distribution using Latrunculin A, a potent actin polymerization inhibitor (Knoblich et al., 1997Knoblich J.A. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. The N terminus of the Drosophila Numb protein directs membrane association and actin-dependent asymmetric localization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 13005-13010Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, Zhao et al., 2002Zhao M. Pu J. Forrester J.V. McCaig C.D. Membrane lipids, EGF receptors, and intracellular signals colocalize and are polarized in epithelial cells moving directionally in a physiological electric field.FASEB J. 2002; 16: 857-859PubMed Google Scholar). When E15–E16 cortical progenitor cells were cultured for 16 hr and then treated with 0.5 or 1 μM Latrunculin A for 1.5 hr, most mitotic cells exhibited defects in cell cleavage (Figure 4D). In these treated cells, EGFR accumulated in the center of the dividing cells and did not distribute asymmetrically, in contrast to control (Figures 4D and 4E; Student’s t test, p < 0.01). TUNEL staining showed no significant difference in cell apoptosis between control and Latrunculin A groups (Figure 4E; Student’s t test, p > 0.05), excluding the possibility that dividing cells with asymmetric EGFR distribution are selectively dying. This shows that EGFR distribution during mitosis is actin dependent. If EGFR asymmetry is important for asymmetric divisions, then we should find that sibling cells in asymmetric pairs would acquire different fates. Hence, we double-stained asymmetric EGFR pairs grown in FGF2-containing medium with different neural cell markers. In previous studies we showed that, at E13–14, some divisions generate two progenitor cells (P/P divisions), some generate a progenitor and a neuron (P/N divisions), and others generate two neurons (N/N divisions) and also that Numb can be asymmetrically distributed at all of these types of divisions (Shen et al., 2002Shen Q. Zhong W. Jan Y.N. Temple S. Asymmetric Numb distribution is critical for asymmetric cell division of mouse cerebral cortical stem cells and neuroblasts.Development. 2002; 129: 4843-4853PubMed Google Scholar). Here we find that asymmetric EGFR is seen largely at P/P divisions and rarely at P/N divisions or N/N divisions. At all ages examined, from E13–E17, the two daughter cells with different levels of EGFR are usually both negative for β-tubulin III and positive for Nestin, a neural progenitor cell marker. EGFR asymmetric pairs at E13–14 consist of 72% P/P divisions, 9% P/N divisions, and 13% N/N divisions, while at E16–17 very few are P/N or N/N divisions (Figures 5A and 5B and Table 2). Therefore, EGFR asymmetric distribution generates two progenitor cells that differ in EGF responsiveness (PEGFRhigh/PEGFRlow).Table 2Neural Markers in Asymmetric EGFR Pairs from E16–E17 LeX Enriched Cortical CellsCell MarkerMarker Description% in EGFR+ Sibling Cell% in EGFR− Sibling Cellβ-tubulin IIINeuronal progenitor cell and postmitotic neuron0 (n = 2)5.8 ± 5.8% (n = 2)NestinNeural progenitor cell91.7 ± 3.4% (n = 2)86.2 ± 2.1% (n = 2)RC2**Radial glial cell68.5 ± 11.1% (n = 4)37.2 ± 11.9% (n = 4)MMA*Neural stem cell/neural progenitor cell74. 1 ± 8.3% (n = 2)48.4 ± 16.4% (n = 2)GLAST*Astrocyte progenitor and astrocyte47.2 ± 29.2% (n = 3)21.5 ± 18.7% (n = 3)Oligo1/2Oligodendrocyte progenitor cell/neural progenitor cell55.8 ± 19.9% (n = 2)47.1 ± 26.0% (n = 2)NG2Oligodendrocyte progenitor cell/neural stem cell0 (n = 3)0 (n = 3)PDGFRαOligodendrocyte progenitor cell0 (n = 3)0 (n = 3)O4Preoligodendrocyte cell0 (n = 2)0 (n = 2)EGFR+ and EGFR− daughters show different profiles of neural markers.χ2 analysis: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01; n, number of experiments (>15 EGFR asymmetric pairs for each experiment). Open table in a new tab EGFR+ and EGFR− daughters show different profiles of neural markers. χ2 analysis: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01; n, number of experiments (>15 EGFR asymmetric pairs for each experiment). The developing cortex contains a heterogeneous mix of progenitor cells; for example, some are restricted progenitors and others, stem cells, while some may have a cortical, and others, a basal forebrain origin. When these are plated in culture and allowed to form pairs, most are born in the 4 hr before fixation, but some are born earlier in the 24 hr culture period, so that pairs have different levels of maturity. With this in mind, heterogeneity in phenotype among the sister cell pairs is expected. Nevertheless, we found significant trends in phenotypic differences between sibling cells. We double-stained E16–17 cortical cell pairs asymmetric for EGFR with known progenitor markers, including LeX, RC2, and GLAST. LeX (also known as Lewis X, SSEA-1, or CD15) is expressed in CNS germinal zones, including subpopulations of radial glia (Mai et al., 1998Mai J.K. Andressen C. Ashwell K.W.

Malaria remains the dominant public health issue in many developing regions of the world, and it is the cause millions of deaths annually with particularly highly mortality among children (1Breman J.G. Egan A. Keusch G.T. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2001; 64: iv-viCrossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recent epidemiological data indicate that the global population exposed to malaria will continue to expand if there are no significant advancements to prevent and treat the disease (2Hay S.I. Guerra C.A. Tatem A.J. Noor A.M. Snow R.W. Lancet. 2004; 4: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for most of the serious or fatal malaria occurrences, and it has developed resistance to commonly employed anti-malarial chemotherapeutics. Consequently, new drugs that can control infection are badly needed (3Winstanley P.A. Ward S.A. Snow R.W. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although the redesign and synthetic optimization of existing anti-malarials extends their lifetime as useful drugs, there is also a need to identify novel chemical scaffolds that inhibit existing and previously unexploited biological targets. The P. falciparum enzymes active in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis (Scheme 1) represent unique targets, because the organism cannot salvage preformed pyrimidine bases or nucleosides (4Gutteridge W.E.

Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), 1The abbreviations used are: DHODH, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase; DCIP, 2,6-dichloroindophenol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Pf, P. falciparum. the fourth enzyme in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, has a number of properties that make it a particularly strong candidate as a new drug target in the parasite. Firstly, inhibitors of human DHODH already have proven efficacy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in humans, demonstrating that the target pathway can be effectively blocked in vivo (7Fox R.I.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1270-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Secondly, the x-ray cocrystal structure of the human enzyme with A77-1726 (12Liu S. Neidhardt E.A. Grossman T.H. Ocain T. Clardy J. Structure. 2000; 8: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) provides strong evidence that species selective inhibitors of the enzyme can be developed. Alignment of the malarial DHODH sequence onto this structure indicated that more than half of the residues that are within van der Waals distance of A77-1726 are variable (Fig. 1). Thirdly, species-selective pyrazole-based inhibitors of Hylicobacter pylori and of Escherichia coli DHODH have been reported that were identified by high-throughput screening of chemical libraries (13Marcinkeviciene J. Rogers M.J. Kopcho L. Jiang W. Wang K. Murphy D.J. Lippy J. Link S. Chung T.D.Y. Hobbs F. Haque T. Trainor G.L. Slee A. Stern A.M. Copeland R.A. Biochem.

Finally, we previously demonstrated that P. falciparum DHODH is poorly inhibited by the potent human DHODH inhibitors redoxal, dichloroallyl lawsone, and A77-1726 analogs (15Baldwin J.

Thus, these studies suggest it should be feasible to exploit active-site differences to identify inhibitors that exhibit a high degree of selectivity toward malarial DHODH.Fig. 1Inhibitor binding-site of hDHODH.

In this paper, we report the use of high-throughput screening technology of a 220,000 small drug-like molecule library to identify a number of potent and selective inhibitors of the P. falciparum DHODH. Two classes of molecules, based on biphenylamide and urea structural scaffolds, were characterized in detail. Chemical Library—The compound collection was provided by the High-throughput Screening Center in the Department of Biochemistry at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center headed by Dr. Michael Roth. The collection is largely from commercial sources as illustrated by the described hits (Table I). It is composed of 220,000 diverse heterocyclic chemicals ranging in molecular mass from 250 to 550 daltons, which were selected for drug-like properties.Table I1 IC50 values were determined using a continuous assay that monitors DCIP reduction at 600 nm. The reagent concentrations were 20 μm CoQ0, 200 μm l-DHO, 120 μm DCIP, and 10 nm enzyme.2 IC50 values were determined using a continuous assay that detects the oxidized product orotate at 296 nm. The reagent concentrations were 20 μm CoQD, 200 μm l-DHO, and 10 nm enzyme.3 The original hit from the library was the 3-methyl-4-nitro derivative. This compound was not commercially available, so the listed analog was used for the follow-up analysis. Open table in a new tab 1 IC50 values were determined using a continuous assay that monitors DCIP reduction at 600 nm. The reagent concentrations were 20 μm CoQ0, 200 μm l-DHO, 120 μm DCIP, and 10 nm enzyme. 2 IC50 values were determined using a continuous assay that detects the oxidized product orotate at 296 nm. The reagent concentrations were 20 μm CoQD, 200 μm l-DHO, and 10 nm enzyme. 3 The original hit from the library was the 3-methyl-4-nitro derivative. This compound was not commercially available, so the listed analog was used for the follow-up analysis. Assay Methodology—The cloning and expression of recombinant P. falciparum and human DHODH were described previously (15Baldwin J. Farajallah A.M. Malmquist N.A. Rathod P.K. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41827-41834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The standard colorimetric DHODH continuous assay that monitors 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCIP) reduction was adapted to an end-point assay in 384-well plates for compatibility with the high-throughput screening format. The assay solution containing 100 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 20 μm CoQ0, 200 μm l-dihydroorotate, and 120 μm DCIP was prepared, and 48 μl was transferred to each well using a Biomek FX robotic liquid-handling device (Beckman Instruments). Each compound was prepared as a 300 μm stock in Me2SO, and of that, 0.5 μl was transferred to the assay mixture to achieve ∼3 μm in each well. The assay was started by the addition of 2 μl of a 25× stock of enzyme prepared in 100 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 15% glycerol to give a final enzyme concentration between 20 and 60 nm in the assay well. The assay was allowed to progress for 20 min at room temperature, and then the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The absorbance of each well was measured at 600 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments), and the data were exported to an Excel (Microsoft) spreadsheet for analysis. A “hit” was recorded when a well had a measured absorbance greater than four standard deviations from the mean absorbance value of the no-drug Me2SO control. This parameter corresponded to ∼60% inhibition of enzymatic activity. Re-screening Hit Compounds—Three sets of master plates were prepared at 300, 60, and 12 μm that consisted only of the compounds identified in the initial screen as potential inhibitors. The inhibition of the parasite enzyme was confirmed, and the selective nature of the compounds was demonstrated by repeating the enzyme assay separately for both the P. falciparum and human DHODH enzymes. The three sets of plates gave final concentrations of 3, 0.6, and 0.12 μm, thereby allowing a preliminary IC50 value to be calculated for each inhibitor according to Equation 1. vi=v01+[I]IC50(Eq. 1) Continuous Kinetic Rate Assays—For several potent compounds, the IC50 values identified in the screen were also confirmed with traditional continuous assays that detect reduction of DCIP or direct production of orotate as described previously (15Baldwin J. Farajallah A.M. Malmquist N.A. Rathod P.K. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41827-41834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The repeat assays used the same reagent concentrations as employed in the high-throughput screening assay. Inhibitor Solubility Studies—Inhibitors (0.1–2.5 μm) were incubated with 10 nm enzyme in assay buffer lacking l-dihydroorotate for 6 min at room temperature. The mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 17,000 rpm, the supernatant was transferred to a cuvette, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of l-dihydroorotate. Compound Verification—Approximately 50 μg of each selected compound was applied to a 250 × 4.6-mm Nucleosil, 5μ C18, 100-Å HPLC column (Varian) equilibrated with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, 10% acetonitrile. The absorbance of each fraction was monitored at 254 nm, and samples were eluted by increasing concentrations of acetonitrile as follows: 10–20% acetonitrile (5 min); 20–70% acetronitrile (45 min); and 70–100% acetonitrile (5 min). The molecular weight of the eluted material was determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and inhibition of the P. falciparum enzyme PfDHODH was tested using the dominant peak. Additional fractions were also collected and tested before and after the major absorbing peak to confirm that enzyme inhibition was not a result of small amount of contaminating material. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The R265A and H185A (corresponding to Arg136 and His56 of human DHODH; Fig. 1) variants of PfDHODH were prepared by PCR mutagenesis of the wild-type expression plasmid using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The R265A construct was generated using primers 5′-CCACGTATTTTTGCAGACGTTGAATCTAG-3′ and 5′-CTAGATTCAACGTCTGCAAAAATACGTGG-3′. Primers 5′-GTGAAATATGTGCTGACCTTTTTTTATTACTAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTAGTAATAAAAAAAGGTCAGCACATATTTCAC-3′ were used to prepare the H185A variant (boldfaced bases represent the altered codon). Expression and purification were performed as described for the wild-type enzyme (15Baldwin J. Farajallah A.M. Malmquist N.A. Rathod P.K. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41827-41834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In Vitro Testing against Cultured Malarial Parasites—To study inhibition of cell proliferation, [3H]hypoxanthine uptake was measured in drug-treated P. falciparum infected erythrocytes as previously described (16Desjardins R.E. Canfield C.J. Haynes J.D. Chulay J.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1979; 16: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar, 17Zhang K. Rathod P.K. Science. 2002; 296: 545-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). High-throughput Screen of a Compound Library to Identify PfDHODH Inhibitors—The oxidation of l-dihydroorotic acid to orotic acid by DHODH occurs in the mitochondria of the parasite and is facilitated by the redox active cofactor flavin mononucleotide (18Krungkrai J. Cerami A. Henderson G.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1934-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19Krungkrai J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1243: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Löffler M. Jöckel J. Schuster G. Becker C. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1997; 174: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The FMNH2 generated from the first half-reaction is then re-oxidized by the second substrate ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10) to complete the catalytic cycle (21Hines V. Johnston M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1222-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as shown in Scheme 1. An end point colorimetric assay of the enzyme was developed that was amenable to high-throughput screening in 384-well plates. It relied on the final oxidation of CoQ by the colorimetric reagent DCIP (see “Materials and Methods”). A chemical library of 220,000 compounds was screened to identify novel inhibitors of the PfDHODH. The screen of the full library was performed with each compound present at a final concentration of 3 μm in the assay mixture. This yielded 1249 compounds that inhibited the enzyme by 60%, a hit rate of 0.6%. The results of a representative plate carrying one such inhibitor is displayed in Fig. 2A. Successful events in the initial screen led to the consolidation of select wells from the original library stock to generate a new second generation of plates for re-screening and verification. Re-screening of these selected compounds was performed at three compound concentrations to allow calculation of a preliminary IC50 value and to test for selectivity by comparison to the human enzyme. Importantly, almost all of the 1249 compounds identified in the original screen proved to be selective inhibitors of PfDHODH. Compounds with calculated IC50 values of <0.6 μm from this second screen were selected for further characterization. Halogenated phenylbenzamide/naphthamide compounds were the predominant class of inhibitor found in this group (Table I). In addition, several urea-based compounds containing napthyl or quinolinyl substituents were also shown to have good inhibitory activity. A number of other inhibitors from unique structural classes were also identified in the screen, and these are currently under evaluation. Verification of Inhibition Properties by Kinetic Rate Assays— The inhibitors shown in Table I were acquired in larger quantity from the indicated chemical suppliers to confirm the identity and inhibition properties of the molecules and to perform additional characterization. The IC50 values were measured by continuous kinetic rate assays using DCIP for detection at six different inhibitor concentrations for both the parasite and human enzymes. In addition, PfDHODH was assayed directly by monitoring orotate production at 296 nm. This avoids potential artifacts from the DCIP reduction assay. Direct detection of orotate was not feasible for the higher concentrations of inhibitor necessary to inhibit the human enzyme, because the compounds absorbed significantly at 296 nm. The IC50 values ranged from 20 to 800 nm in these assays, confirming that the screen had identified a number of compounds that reversibly inhibit PfDHODH at nanomolar concentrations. The compounds also demonstrated selective inhibition of the parasite enzyme. The IC50 values for the human enzyme were from 70- to 12,500-fold higher than for PfDHODH. The largest difference in selectivity (12,500-fold) was observed for N-(3,5-dichloro-phenyl)-2-methyl-3-nitro-benzamide (compound 6), which was also the most potent inhibitor of the parasite enzyme (Table I and Fig. 2). Verification of Compound Purity and Identity—To confirm the structural identity of the inhibitors, compounds were separated by reverse-phase HPLC and their molecular mass was verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. A representative HPLC analysis for N-(3,5-dichloro-phenyl)-2-methyl-3-nitro-benzamide (compound 6) is presented (Fig. 3). Inhibition of PfDHODH was tested using material from peak 1 to peak 4. Only material from peak 3 inhibited the enzymatic activity (data not shown; IC50 = 24 ± 2nm), and the mass (324) was consistent with the supplier expectation. These data confirm that compound 6 and not a degradation product or contaminant is responsible for the observed inhibition of PfDHODH. Similar analysis with other compounds from Table I also confirmed the structure and integrity of the hits from the high-throughput screen. Evaluation of Compound Selectivity—A number of compounds identified either by high-throughput screening or by structure-based computational approaches inhibit a wide range of target receptors, and thus they have been named promiscuous inhibitors (22McGovern S.L. Caselli E. Grigorieff N. Shoichet B.K. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 1712-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 23Seidler J. McGovern S.L. Doman T.N. Shoichet B.K. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 4477-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 24Ryan A.J. Gray N.M. Lowe P.N. Chung C.W. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 3448-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 25McGovern S.L. Helfand B.T. Feng B. Shoichet B.K. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 4265-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Many of these compounds form submicrometer aggregates that generate a large surface to which the enzyme is reversibly sequestered (23Seidler J. McGovern S.L. Doman T.N. Shoichet B.K. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 4477-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Typically, these compounds have inhibition constants in the micromolar range. In addition, aggregation can be reversed through the addition of detergent such as Triton X-100 (24Ryan A.J. Gray N.M. Lowe P.N. Chung C.W. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 3448-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We restricted our hits to molecules with IC50 values <0.6 μm, and the assays were performed in the presence of detergent. Nonetheless, further experiments to exclude compound promiscuity were performed by assaying activity following centrifugation of a preincubated solution of enzyme and inhibitor. If precipitation or aggregation of the enzyme leads to the observed inhibition, centrifugation would be expected to decrease the enzyme activity relative to the non-centrifuged samples and artificially lower the measured IC50 values. Compounds 6, 8, and 12 were assayed in this manner, and the calculated IC50 values are in close agreement with the values obtained from the standard assays. Identification of Inhibitor-binding Sites on PfDHODH—The x-ray structures of the two potent inhibitors, A77-1726 and Brequinar, in complex with the human enzyme demonstrate that both molecules are positioned in the pocket adjacent to the flavin cofactor (Fig. 1). To test the hypothesis that our newly identified inhibitors bind to this variable site, we utilized site-directed mutagenesis to evaluate the effects of mutation of two conserved residues (R265A and H185A) on the inhibitory properties of the compounds. Inhibitor potency is affected by both substitutions providing good evidence that these compounds bind in the A77-1726 pocket (Table II). Mutation of His185 had the largest effect and increased the IC50 value 500–1000-fold for all 13 compounds, suggesting that this residue is an important binding determinant for the entire class. The corresponding residue (His56) from the human DHODH enzyme was also shown to be an important determinant for high-affinity binding of the anti-proliferative agent Brequinar (26Davis J.P. Copeland R.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mutation of Arg265 only affected the inhibitory properties of half of the compounds, and these effects were more modest (3–35-fold), suggesting that the inhibitors have some variation in their binding modes.Table IIInhibitor kinetic analysis for mutant PfDHODHsCompoundIC50WTPfDHODHPfR265APfH185Aμm10.05 ± 0.010.08 ± 0.03 (2)>50 (>1000)20.05 ± 0.010.05 ± 0.01 (1)570 ± 130 (11,400)30.47 ± 0.050.30 ± 0.08 (0.6)210 ± 40 (440)40.06 ± 0.011.2 ± 0.3 (2.0)140 ± 30 (2400)50.10 ± 0.020.50 ± 0.07 (5)130 ± 30 (1300)60.02 ± 0.0020.40 ± 0.10 (20)130 ± 20 (6300)70.26 ± 0.020.82 ± 0.06 (3)250 ± 60 (960)80.08 ± 0.020.48 ± 0.09 (6)180 ± 40 (2300)90.08 ± 0.012.8 ± 0.5 (35)60 ± 20 (790)100.08 ± 0.010.37 ± 0.06 (5)120 ± 20 (1600)110.40 ± 0.040.34 ± 0.01 (1)>200 (>500)120.23 ± 0.050.24 ± 0.07 (1)140 ± 30 (600)130.78 ± 0.142.0 ± 0.4 (3)>400 (>500) Open table in a new tab The mutations also had modest effects on the steady-state kinetic parameters. The Km for CoQD was increased 2–4-fold, and the kcat value was reduced by a similar amount (Table III). Similar to the effects observed on inhibitor binding, the mutation of His185 was more detrimental to activity than the mutation of Arg265, causing an overall 16-fold reduction in kcat/Km, CoQ. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that CoQ binds in the same site as A77-1726 and these newly identified inhibitors of the malarial enzyme. To further demonstrate that the CoQ and the inhibitor binding sites overlap, the mode of inhibition for N-(3,5-dichloro-phenyl)-2-methyl-3-nitro-benzamide (compound 6) was examined more extensively by determining IC50 values at increasing concentrations of the CoQD substrate (Fig. 4). The observed linear increase in the IC50 values with respect to substrate concentration is indicative of competitive inhibition, and therefore, this compound probably binds to the CoQ site.Table IIISteady-state kinetic analysis for mutant pfDHODHspfDHODHkcatKm (CoQD)Km (L-DHO)s-1μmWT7.8 ± 0.216 ± 191 ± 5R265A4.6 ± 0.132 ± 5105 ± 6H185A107 ± 0.166 ± 8123 ± 20 Open table in a new tab Effects of DHODH Inhibitors on Cultured P. falciparum Parasites—The compounds listed in Table I were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of cultured parasites. Compound 1 had modest activity in whole cell assays against P. falciparum. Proliferation was inhibited by 2% at 5 μm and by 20% at 10 μm. No significant growth inhibition was observed for any of the other compounds listed in Table I at concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 μm, depending on the solubility limits. Thus, despite high potency against purified PfDHODH, these compounds do not effectively inhibit parasite growth. Current clinically useful antimalarial drugs were mostly discovered from leads that are several decades old and suffer from resistance, as well as cross-resistance among members of the same class of compounds (27White N.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 335: 800-806Crossref Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 28Rathod P.K. McErlean T. Lee P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9389-9393Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 29White N.J. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1992; 30: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This, plus the high incidence of downstream drop-offs in drug development projects, makes it important to develop fresh leads for new antimalarials. Malaria parasites, unlike the host mammalian cells, are completely dependent on de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Here, a high-throughput screening technology involving ∼220,000 molecules was employed to identify new potent and selective inhibitors of malarial DHODH, an important enzyme in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. One compound inhibited PfDHODH with an IC50 of 16 nm and demonstrated a 12,500-fold difference in specificity for host versus parasite enzyme (compound 6, Table I). There were over a dozen compounds that inhibited below 100 nm and showed at least 100-fold selectivity. The most potent and selective PfDHODH inhibitors displayed some structural similarities among themselves. There was an uncommon representation of amide and urea moieties conjugated to large aromatics (Table I). It is likely that, structurally and electronically, the carbonyl groups satisfy an important binding requirement for potency. The planarity of the aromatics plus the rotational resistance of the amides also appeared to be important for potent inhibition of malaria enzyme. Some, but not all, of these molecular features were previously found in the potent human DHODH inhibitor A77-1726. Although this compound carries an aromatic amine substitution, its acyl group is a small propeneamide instead of larger benzamide/naphthamide derivatives discovered in the present screen. The importance of the acyl size for host-parasite specificity is highlighted by A77-1726 analogs in which the propenamide was replaced with a quinolone. The resulting larger compounds were poor inhibitors of the human DHODH enzyme (30Papageorgiou C. von Matt A. Joergensen J. Andersen E. Wagner K. Beerli C. Than T. Borer X. Florineth A. Rihs G. Schreier M.H. Weckbecker G. Heusser C. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 1986-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The analogs of A77-1726, which are potent inhibitors of the human enzyme, are very poor inhibitors of PfDHODH (15Baldwin J. Farajallah A.M. Malmquist N.A. Rathod P.K. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41827-41834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In parallel studies with other microorganisms, A77-1726 does not inhibit Gram-negative bacteria H. pylori DHODH or E. coli DHODH. Novel pyrazole-based compounds that selectively inhibit H. pylori or E. coli DHODH have little effect on the human enzyme or cross-activity between the bacterial enzymes (13 90,14). Seven of the potent and selective molecules (compounds 4-10) in the present screen were 2-nitro-3-methyl-benzamide derivatives. This is probably due to a good representation of this family of molecules in the source libraries, the high preference of the parasite enzyme for the 2-nitro-3-methyl-benzamide unit, and significant tolerance for change at the distal halogenated aromatic amines. Because the naphthamide derivatives (compounds 1-3) are also potent, it is clear that the parasite enzyme offers multiple solutions for selective recognition of DHODH. Compounds 11–13 represent yet another class of inhibitors. In this set, urea moieties carried a naphthylamine or quinolinylamine on one end and a substituted phenylamine on the other end. Whereas this urea scaffold could offer selectivity toward the parasite enzyme (compound 11), the screen failed to find potency that matched the best members of the amide-based compounds. The amide-based as well as the urea-based inhibitors of the malaria enzyme appear to interact with the same part of the enzyme as traditional inhibitors of DHODH from other species. Primary structure alignment of DHODH enzymes from different organisms revealed that both variable and highly conserved residues comprise the A77-1726 binding site, suggesting that the variable residues form the basis for the observed species selective inhibition of PfDHODH (Fig. 1). Site-directed mutagenesis of two conserved residues in this pocket was used to determine whether the newly discovered inhibitors of the malarial enzyme also bound this site. The H185A mutation decreased the affinity of many compounds by over 1,000-fold, providing strong support for the hypothesis that these newly discovered inhibitors also bind this site (Table 2). Although mutagenesis has not been performed on any of the variable residues in this pocket, it seems likely that the structural basis for the species-selective inhibition is due to the differences in the shape and hydrophobicity of the pocket resulting from the variable amino acid composition. The mutant analysis also revealed some differences in the binding modes between inhibitors. The R265A mutation affected some compounds by up to 35-fold, whereas there was no effect on others. This site is also thought to bind CoQ, although direct structural evidence for the CoQ site is still lacking (12Liu S. Neidhardt E.A. Grossman T.H. Ocain T. Clardy J.

In support of a common binding site for the malaria enzyme, the most potent benzamidine derivatives (compound 6) appeared to be a simple competitive inhibitor with respect to CoQ utilization. A comparison of the human DHODH crystal structures with the malaria DHODH amino acid sequence had suggested that malaria DHODH offers unusual opportunities for species-specific inhibitor binding. The present study formally demonstrates that it is possible to identify potent inhibitors of P. falciparum DHODH that do not inhibit the human enzyme. Because malaria parasites lack enzymes for salvage of preformed pyrimidines, such compounds have enormous potential for selectivity at the cellular level. However, the transition from enzyme inhibitors to clinically useful anti-malarials will, of course, offer new challenges. A useful drug must be effective against whole cells, exhibit low toxicity toward host cells, and have a desirable pharmacokinetic profile. Whereas the compounds shown in Table I are excellent inhibitors of PfDHODH activity, they had weak anti-malarial activity in cell-based assays. In principle, one possible explanation for the low in vivo efficacy is the inefficient uptake of the compounds by the parasite. However, both amide and urea-derived molecules are known to function effectively as antiparasitic agents. Niclosamide or niclocide (5-chloro-N-(2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide) is an antihelmintic compound used to treat worm infections. Its mode of action is to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria of the parasite (32Kane H.J. Behm C.A. Bryant C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1980; 1: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This is encouraging, because DHODH also has a mitochondrial location. In addition, diphenyl ureas that inhibit plasmepsins from P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax show selective killing of Plasmodium versus mammalian cell lines (33Jiang S. Prigge S.T. Wei L. Gao Y-E. Hudson T.H. Gerena L. Dame J.B. Kyle D.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2577-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). On this basis, a second generation library of the most potent inhibitors is likely to lead to compounds that are effective in whole cells. To this end, the synthetic simplicity of preparing biphenylamide derivatives should be helpful."

https://openalex.org/W2126830484,"While firing rate is well established as a relevant parameter for encoding information exchanged between neurons, the significance of other parameters is more conjectural. Here, we show that regularity of neuronal spike activities affects sensorimotor processing in tottering mutants, which suffer from a mutation in P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels. While the modulation amplitude of the simple spike firing rate of their floccular Purkinje cells during optokinetic stimulation is indistinguishable from that of wild-types, the regularity of their firing is markedly disrupted. The gain and phase values of tottering’s compensatory eye movements are indistinguishable from those of flocculectomized wild-types or from totterings with the flocculus treated with P/Q-type calcium channel blockers. Moreover, normal eye movements can be evoked in tottering when the flocculus is electrically stimulated with regular spike trains mimicking the firing pattern of normal simple spikes. This study demonstrates the importance of regularity of firing in Purkinje cells for neuronal information processing."
https://openalex.org/W2044633101,"We report here that the prototypical yeast transcription factor Gal4 undergoes two distinct modes of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis: one that occurs independent of transcription and restricts Gal4 function, and another that is transcription coupled and essential for productive activation of Gal4 target genes. Destruction of transcriptionally active Gal4 depends on an F box protein called Dsg1/Mdm30. In the absence of Dsg1, Gal4 is stable, nonubiquitylated, and unable to productively stimulate transcription. Analysis of the phenotype of dsg1-null yeast reveals a striking disconnect between GAL gene RNA and protein levels; in the absence of Dsg1, Gal4 target genes are transcribed, but the resulting RNAs are not translated. The translational defects of these RNAs are related to defects in phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain, which in turn affects recruitment of RNA processing machinery. We propose that Gal4 ubiquitylation and destruction are required for initiation-competent transcription complexes to transition to fully mature elongating complexes capable of appropriate mRNA processing."

We found that developmental refinement of RFs is accompanied by a progressive matching in the topography and strength of excitatory and inhibitory connections made on single tectal neurons, a process that depends critically on a proper level of GABAergic inhibitory activity. We first examined the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections underlying visual RFs in the Xenopus retinotectal system at different developmental stages. To map the RF, we stimulated different retinal areas in a pseudorandom sequence with square-shaped flash stimuli, each representing a unit of an 8 × 7 grid that covers a major portion of the retina (see Experimental Procedures). Compound synaptic currents (CSCs) evoked by each unit stimulus were monitored by the perforated whole-cell patch recording, under two different clamping voltages corresponding to the reversal potentials of glutamatergic and GABA/glycinergic synaptic currents (Ee and Ei), respectively. Figure 1A shows an example of those CSCs evoked by a unit stimulus at the same location on the retina. When the cell was clamped at Ei and Ee, fast inward glutamatergic currents and slow outward currents were recorded, respectively (Figure 1A, top and bottom). The outward currents were blocked by the application of bicuculline in the tectum, and thus were mediated by GABAA receptors (Figure 1B). In this report, we refer to glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs as excitatory and inhibitory inputs, respectively, although the latter may be depolarizing during early developmental stages (Mueller et al., 1984Mueller A.L. Taube J.S. Schwartzkroin P.A. Development of hyperpolarizing inhibitory postsynaptic potentials and hyperpolarizing response to gamma-aminobutyric acid in rabbit hippocampus studied in vitro.J.

We found that excitatory CSCs evoked by the visual stimulus were followed by inhibitory CSCs (Figure 1C), with a delay of 9.6 ± 5.3 ms (±SD, n = 20 cells, analyzed for the “off” responses), consistent with the presence of feedforward or feedback local GABAergic circuits within the tectum, which have been observed at early developmental stages (stage 40 and 41) (Zhang et al., 1998Zhang L.I.

Poo M. Visual input induces long-term potentiation of developing retinotectal synapses.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 708-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To examine the developmental refinement of RFs of tectal neurons, we first mapped the tectal RFs in the tadpoles of relatively mature stages. We displayed the RFs determined by excitatory and inhibitory inputs by color coding the magnitude of integrated charge of stimulus-evoked excitatory or inhibitory CSCs measured within a defined time window after the termination of each unit stimulus (see Figure 1A and Experimental Procedures). Figure 1D shows RFs determined by excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs (eRF and iRF) in a neuron of a stage 48 tadpole. We found that eRF and iRF had similar shape and were closely matched in their spatial profiles. The centers of eRF and iRF, where the strongest synaptic responses were elicited, were close to each other. To further determine whether the close matching of eRF and iRF is an intrinsic property of developing circuits or is established gradually during development, we examined eRFs and iRFs of tectal neurons in tadpoles of different developmental stages. Figure 1E shows an example of evoked responses and reconstructed eRFs and iRFs of a tectal cell in a stage 44 tadpole. Compared with that of a stage 48 tadpole shown in Figure 1D (4 days older), these RFs were much larger in size (covering ∼80% of the retina), consistent with diffuse connectivity during early development. In addition, eRF and iRF exhibited distinctly disparate spatial profiles, with separate RF centers. Examination of RFs from a large population of cells during stage 43 to 48 showed a progressive reduction in the size of eRFs and iRFs with development (Figures 2A–2C , top, and Figure 2D). As RFs became reduced in size, there was increasing spatial matching between eRF and iRF, as reflected by the changes in both the topography and strength of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. At stage 43-44, two types of RFs showed substantial nonoverlapping topography (Figure 2A, top). No significant correlation was found between the magnitude of the total charge of CSCs for each pair of excitatory and inhibitory CSCs evoked by the same unit stimulus (Figure 2A, bottom). With development, the strength of excitatory and inhibitory inputs became more correlated (Figures 2B and 2C, bottom). Increased spatial matching of eRFs and iRFs was quantitatively shown by a progressive reduction in the average distance between the centers of eRF and iRF (Figure 2E, blank) and an increase in the average correlation coefficient for the magnitude of excitatory and inhibitory CSCs evoked by the unit stimulus (Figure 2E, gray). To further characterize the synaptic changes accompanying the refinement of RFs, we analyzed the total integrated synaptic conductance (ISC), defined as the sum of the integrated charges of CSCs evoked by all unit stimuli covering the RF, normalized by the driving force (see Experimental Procedures). The total ISC for excitatory inputs showed a slight decline with development (Figure 2F), with a small but significant increase in the average ISC, defined as the total ISC divided by the number of unit stimuli within the RF (Figure 2G). On the other hand, the total ISC for inhibitory inputs showed a substantial decrease, with a concomitant reduction in the average ISC (Figures 2F and 2G). For excitatory inputs, these observations suggest a substantial pruning of connections made by RGCs at more peripheral regions of the RF and a strengthening of those connections made by RGCs at the emerging center of RFs. This is consistent with previous findings of the pruning of developing retinogeniculate connections in the mammalian visual system (Chen and Regehr, 2000Chen C. Regehr W.G. Developmental remodeling of the retinogeniculate synapse.Neuron. 2000; 28: 955-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Further recording of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in the tectal neuron by minimum stimulation of RGC fibers in the contralateral retina (see Experimental Procedures) indeed showed a larger mean amplitude of unitary EPSCs in stage 47-48 tadpoles, as compared to that in stage 43-44 tadpoles (Figures 2H and 2I). For inhibitory inputs, on the other hand, there appeared to be both a pruning of peripheral inputs and a reduction in the strength of individual inhibitory connections. Indeed, spontaneous IPSCs recorded under constant background illumination exhibited a reduced mean frequency (4.2 ± 0.6 Hz, n = 8 for stage 44; 1.6 ± 0.3 Hz, n = 9 for stage 47-48) and a reduced mean amplitude in older tadpoles (Figure 2J). Taken together, our results suggest that two distinct forms of developmental changes—pruning of connections and modification of synaptic strength—contribute to the development of a spatially matched topography of eRF and iRF and a balanced excitation and inhibition in more mature tectal neurons. In early stages of Xenopus development, inhibitory inputs constitute the major part of visual stimulus-evoked responses (Figures 2F and 2G). There is evidence in mammalian primary visual cortex that GABAergic transmission is essential for triggering the onset of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity (Hensch et al., 1998Hensch T.K. Fagiolini M. Mataga N. Stryker M.P. Baekkeskov S. Kash S.F.

Inhibitory threshold for critical-period activation in primary visual cortex.Nature. 2000; 404: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). GABAergic activity may also promote maturation of glutamatergic synapses (Ben-Ari, 2002Ben-Ari Y. Excitatory actions of GABA during development: the nature of the nurture.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 9: 728-739Crossref Scopus (1704) Google Scholar, Owens and Kriegstein, 2002Owens D.F. Kriegstein A.R. Is there more to GABA than synaptic inhibition?.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). We thus further examined the impact of inhibitory synaptic activity on the refinement of RFs, using pharmacological manipulations of GABAergic transmission in the tectum. Chronic blockade of the GABAA receptor-mediated activity was performed by daily injection of bicuculline, a specific blocker of GABAA receptors (see Experimental Procedures), into the ventricle of the tadpole brain. Chronic augmentation of GABAergic transmission was also induced by daily injection of diazepam, a drug that increases the open probability and channel conductance of GABAA receptors in a use-dependent manner (Macdonald and Olsen, 1994Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. GABAA receptor channels.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar, Rogers et al., 1994Rogers C.J. Twyman R.E. Macdonald R.L.

Curmi J.P. Birnir B. Gage P.W. Hippocampal GABA(A) channel conductance increased by diazepam.Nature. 1997; 388: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The development of RFs of treated tadpoles was examined at later stages. We found that, at stage 48, the average size of both eRFs and iRFs was significantly larger in either bicuculline- or diazepam-treated tadpoles, as compared to untreated controls (Figures 3A and 3B ). There was also a reduced spatial matching between pairs of eRF and iRF mapped for each tectal neuron. As summarized in Figures 3C and 3D, developmental refinement of eRFs and iRFs was similarly impeded in both bicuculline- and diazepam-treated tadpoles, but not in tadpoles injected with the vehicle solution (0.9% NaCl, 10% propylene glycol). It appears that RF refinement in the treated animals occurred at a slower rate than normal. In drug-treated tadpoles examined at stage 48, the average distance between the center of the paired eRF and iRFs was significantly larger and the correlation between the total synaptic drive of glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs was significantly lower than that in controls, with bicuculline-treated tadpoles exhibiting more severe effects (Figures 3E and 3F). For bicuculline-treated tadpoles, there was a significant decrease in the mean glutamatergic ISC evoked by the unit stimulus and an increase in the GABAergic ISC in stages 47 tadpoles (Figures 3G and 3H). On the other hand, both glutamatergic and GABAergic ISCs were larger in diazepam-treated tadpoles than in controls (Figures 3G and 3H). These results cannot be accounted for solely by a homeostatic regulation of synaptic strength caused by chronic changes in neuronal excitation (Turrigiano and Nelson, 2000Turrigiano G.G. Nelson S.B. Hebb and homeostasis in neuronal plasticity.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 3: 358-364Crossref Scopus (501) Google Scholar, Liu, 2004Liu G. Local structural balance and functional interaction of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in hippocampal dendrites.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) (see below). Coordinated changes in excitatory and inhibitory inputs suggest interactions between GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs during the refinement process. To further characterize the impact of GABAergic inputs on neuronal activity, both visually evoked and spontaneous spiking activities were recorded in cell-attached configuration before and after local perfusion of either bicuculline or diazepam on the tectum. For visual stimulus-induced responses, bicuculline application led to an increase in the number of spikes and in the duration of the spike train (Figure 4A ), as expected for a reduced shunting inhibition by feedforward or feedback GABAergic inputs to the recorded neuron. Changes were also observed in the spontaneous firing pattern after perfusion with bicuculline (Figure 4B1). The high-frequency discharges (>100 Hz) were markedly enhanced (Figures 4B2–4B3). While the average spike rate was increased only slightly (21%), the spontaneous activity was transformed into a periodic bursting activity (Figure 4B1). Similar effect was observed in 7/10 cells. In addition, the power spectrum of the firing pattern exhibited a larger 40 Hz component, which reflects the spiking frequency within the burst (data not shown). This switch to a periodic bursting activity is reminiscent of the synchronized bursting of neocortical neurons following convulsant-induced disinhibition (Prince and Connors, 1984Prince D.A. Connors B.W. Mechanisms of epileptogenesis in cortical structures.Ann. Neurol. 1984; 16: S59-S64Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Overall, bicuculline application led to 1.5 ± 0.3 fold (n = 7) increase in the number of spikes evoked by the visual stimulus (Figure 4E, left), 26% ± 6% (n = 10) increase in the average firing rate (Figure 4E, middle) and 2.1 ± 1.0 fold (n = 10) increase in the component of high-frequency discharges (ISI < 100 ms) (Figure 4E, right). In contrast to the effects of bicuculline, perfusion with diazepam resulted in a 43% ± 12% (n = 7) reduction in the total number of spikes evoked by the visual stimulus and a 25% ± 4% (n = 10) decrease in the average firing rate of the spontaneous spiking activity (Figures 4C–4E). Application of vehicle solution did not result in any apparent change in the firing activity of the tectal cells (Figure 4E). Taken together, these results suggest that the impediment of the developmental refinement of both glutamatergic and GABAergic connections may be attributed to alterations in the temporal pattern and/or the level of spiking activity in the tectal neuron, as a result of either increasing or decreasing GABAergic synaptic activity. In the present study, we have used the whole-cell, voltage-clamp recording method to isolate visual stimulus-evoked excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the tectal cell and examined developmental changes in the organization of these inputs. We found that in more mature tadpoles, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic drive evoked by the same stimulus is balanced, with eRF and iRF of the same neuron topographically matched. This is reminiscent of the specific correlation between excitation and inhibition found in adult mammalian sensory cortices. In cat primary visual cortex, the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic drive for most orientation-specific neurons have similar tuning preference and tuning width (Anderson et al., 2000Anderson J.S.

For direction-selective simple cells, synaptic excitation and inhibition are tuned for the same direction, but differ in relative timing (Priebe and Ferster, 2005Priebe N.J. Ferster D.

In the present study, we showed that balanced excitation and inhibition of the tectal neuron emerges gradually during development, and this developmental process requires the presence of an appropriate level of GABAergic synaptic activity in the tectum. Matching of eRF and iRF may result from two developmental processes: formation and elimination of retinotectal and intratectal connections and changes in synaptic strength of those connections. Consistent delay in the onset of inhibitory CSCs, relative to that of excitatory CSCs (Figure 1C), suggests that inhibitory currents result from the activation of GABAergic intratectal interneurons by RGC inputs. The initial mismatched topography of eRF and iRF at early stages indicates that RGCs that contribute to the excitatory and inhibitory activities in each tectal neuron belong to largely nonoverlapping RGC populations. Developmental reduction of RF size is consistent with a gradual pruning of retinotectal and/or intratectal connections, although the reduction of the RF size of retinal neurons may also contribute. Together, a matched topography in a more mature tectum is achieved when the same set of RGCs within the RF are responsible for both excitation and inhibition of each tectal neuron. While the precise contribution of circuit remodelling in the retina remains to be determined, our results on tectal manipulations of GABAergic transmission suggest that refinement of connectivity within the tectum plays an essential role in the refinement of RFs of tectal neurons. The developmental pruning and remodelling of retinotectal connections in the Xenopus visual system has been well-documented. Previous recording of multiunit spikes from retinal axon terminals showed that stage 44 tadpoles exhibit large RFs (100° or more), which become progressively smaller in older tadpoles (Gaze et al., 1974Gaze R.M. Keating M.J. Chung S.H. The evolution of the retinotectal map during development in Xenopus.Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1974; 185: 301-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Morphological studies showed that the axonal arbors of individual retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) cover a progressive smaller portion of the tectal neuropil during larval development (Sakaguchi and Murphey, 1985Sakaguchi D.S. Murphey R.K. Map formation in the developing Xenopus retinotectal system: an examination of ganglion cell terminal arborizations.J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 3228-3245PubMed Google Scholar), in part as a result of the growth of the tectum. As the tectum elongates caudally, due to caudal-medial location of the proliferation zone, RGC axons from the nasal retina make corresponding shift of their innervation caudally (Gaze et al., 1974Gaze R.M. Keating M.J. Chung S.H. The evolution of the retinotectal map during development in Xenopus.Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1974; 185: 301-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus the refinement of retinotectal connections must also involve a progressive shift in the center of the RFs. In our study, we found a reduction in the total ISC for both excitatory and inhibitory inputs (Figure 2F), as well as in the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs (7.6 ± 0.7 Hz at stage 44, 3.9 ± 0.5 Hz at stage 48, SEM, n = 20 in each group) and IPSCs (Figure 2J), consistent with a reduced number of retinal inputs to the tectal neuron. Measurements of the amplitude of unitary EPSCs and IPSCs, on the other hand, showed a significant strengthening of glutamatergic synapses but a weakening of GABAergic synapses. Taken together, these results suggest that the refinement process involves the elimination of earlier synaptic connections and establishment of new ones and the modification of the strength of existing connections. The strength of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the tectal neuron must be modified in a coordinated manner so that a balanced excitation and inhibition can be achieved in the mature tectum. We suggest that there is a positive feedback mechanism that helps to strengthen and stabilize those inhibitory inputs that correctly match spatially and temporally with the excitatory inputs. Cortical and hippocampal GABAergic synapses are known to be capable of detecting and can be modif"

I., Lin, S., Cotter, R. J., and Raetz, C. R. H. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 1156–1163). A Ca2+-induced, membrane-bound enzyme was responsible for the transfer of the pEtN unit to the Kdo domain. We now report the identification of the gene encoding the pEtN transferase. E. coli yhjW was cloned and overexpressed, because it is homologous to a putative pEtN transferase implicated in the modification of the β-chain heptose residue of Neisseria meningitidis lipo-oligosaccharide (Mackinnon, F.

In vitro assays with Kdo2-4′-[32P]lipid A as the acceptor showed that YhjW (renamed EptB) utilizes phosphatidylethanolamine in the presence of Ca2+ to transfer the pEtN group. Stoichiometric amounts of diacylglycerol were generated during the EptB-catalyzed transfer of pEtN to Kdo2-lipid A. EptB is an inner membrane protein of 574 amino acid residues with five predicted trans-membrane segments within its N-terminal region. An in-frame replacement of eptB with a kanamycin resistance cassette rendered E. coli WBB06 (but not wild-type W3110) hypersensitive to CaCl2 at 5 mm or higher. Ca2+ hypersensitivity was suppressed by excess Mg2+ in the medium or by restoring the LPS core of WBB06. The latter was achieved by reintroducing the waaC and waaF genes, which encode LPS heptosyl transferases I and II, respectively. Our data demonstrate that pEtN modification of the outer Kdo protected cells containing heptose-deficient LPS from damage by high concentrations of Ca2+.

The lipid A moiety and the 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residues of the core are essential for growth of E. coli and most other Gram-negative bacteria (6Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar). Strains lacking all LPS sugars distal to Kdo are termed heptose-deficient or “deep rough” (6Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), but are hypersensitive to serum and antibiotics (4Nikaido H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 950Google Scholar).Under certain conditions, strains of E. coli and Salmonella synthesize LPS molecules modified with a phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) group at position 7 of the outer Kdo residue (9Brabetz W.

Kanipes et al. (10Kanipes M.I. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) later demonstrated that pEtN addition to LPS in WBB06 is a consequence of the presence of Ca2+ in the growth medium used by Brabetz et al. (9Brabetz W. Muller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and is unrelated to the deletion of the heptosyl transferase genes. A pEtN transferase activity is present in membranes of WBB06 grown in the presence of 5–50 mm Ca2+ (10Kanipes M.I. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The enzyme is stimulated by exogenous phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and is selective for the outer Kdo residue of Kdo2-lipid A and related substrates (10Kanipes M.I. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Addition of EDTA to the in vitro pEtN transferase assay was found to be inhibitory.We have now identified the gene that encodes the Ca2+-induced pEtN transferase. YhjW is one of six putative pEtN transferases present in E. coli that are homologous to a Neisseria meningitidis gene required for the modification of the lipo-oligosaccharide β-chain heptose with pEtN (11Mackinnon F.G. Cox A.D. Plested J.S. Tang C.M. Makepeace K. Coull P.A. Wright J.C. Chalmers R. Hood D.W. Richards J.C. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate unambiguously that recombinant YhjW, renamed EptB, utilizes PE as its donor substrate in vitro, generates diacylglycerol as a by-product, and depends upon the presence of Ca2+ in the assay system for activity. Expression of EptB can be re-engineered to be dependent upon the lac promoter, in which case induction of activity no longer requires the addition of Ca2+ to the growth medium. Deletion of eptB in the heptose-deficient mutant WBB06 renders this strain strikingly hyper-sensitive to Ca2+ at concentrations ≥5 mm, suggesting a function for pEtN modification of the Kdo region in the maintenance of envelope stability. Deletion of eptB in wild-type W3110 does not lead to significant Ca2+ hypersensitivity, indicating that certain outer core sugars, when present, may provide a similar stabilizing effect.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—32Pi and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Cultures of BLR(DE3)/pLysS/pLpxL were grown in LB broth at 37 °C to A600 of ∼0.6, and then 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added.

Next, the overnight cultures were used to inoculate 200 ml of LB cultures (initial A600 = 0.02) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mm IPTG. When the A600 reached 1.0, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 20 min (0–4 °C). Cells were resuspended in 4 ml of cold 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and broken by a single passage through a French pressure cell at 10,000 pounds/square inch. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 20 min. Membranes were prepared by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The membranes were resuspended in 8 ml of Hepes, pH 7.5, and the ultracentrifugation was repeated a second time at 100,000 × g to remove contaminating cytosol. The final membrane pellet was stored in 750 μl of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method.

The supernatant, containing the 32P-labeled lipid, was removed, and the extraction of the silica was repeated, first with 4 ml and then with 8 ml of the acidic single-phase Bligh/Dyer mixture. The extracts were pooled, passed through a 4-ml glass-wool column to remove remaining silica particles, and placed into glass tubes equipped with Teflon-lined caps.

https://openalex.org/W1999055062,"GABAergic signaling is central to the function of the thalamus and has been traditionally attributed primarily to the nucleus reticularis thalami (nRT). Here we present a GABAergic pathway, distinct from the nRT, that exerts a powerful inhibitory effect selectively in higher-order thalamic relays of the rat. Axons originating in the anterior pretectal nucleus (APT) innervated the proximal dendrites of relay cells via large GABAergic terminals with multiple release sites. Stimulation of the APT in an in vitro slice preparation revealed a GABAA receptor-mediated, monosynaptic IPSC in relay cells. Activation of presumed single APT fibers induced rebound burst firing in relay cells. Different APT neurons recorded in vivo displayed fast bursting, tonic, or rhythmic firing. Our data suggest that selective extrareticular GABAergic control of relay cell activity will result in effective, state-dependent gating of thalamocortical information transfer in higher-order but not in first-order relays."
https://openalex.org/W1968964934,"Movement sequences, defined both by the component movements and by the serial order in which they are produced, are fundamental building blocks of motor behavior. The serial order of sequence production is strongly encoded in medial motor areas. It is not known to what extent sequences are further elaborated or encoded in primary motor cortex. Here, we describe cells in the primary motor cortex of the monkey that show anticipatory activity exclusively related to a specific memorized sequence of upcoming movements. In addition, the injection of muscimol, a GABA agonist, into motor cortex resulted in an increase in the error rate during sequence production, without concomitant effects on nonsequenced motor performance. Our results challenge the role of medial motor areas in the control of well-practiced movement sequences and suggest that motor cortex contains a complete apparatus for the planning and production of this complex behavior."

Visual information is encoded in the firing patterns of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and is transmitted to thalamocortical (TC) neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus. Each TC neuron receives powerful synaptic contacts from one to three RGCs (Chen and Regehr, 2000Chen C. Regehr W.G.

Although the visually evoked responses of each TC neuron are dominated by these inputs, interneurons within the LGN provide feed-forward inhibition that further regulates these responses (Berardi and Morrone, 1984Berardi N.

One important function of inhibitory interneurons within the LGN may involve shaping TC neuron receptive fields. The more pronounced center-surround inhibition observed in TC neurons relative to RGCs suggests that LGN interneurons may contribute to surround inhibition (Norton and Godwin, 1992Norton T.T.

Although it has been difficult to study this inhibition directly, receptive field properties suggest that RGC activation of interneurons results in inhibition that spreads to TC neurons beyond those directly activated by RGCs. Interneurons within the LGN may also provide precisely timed inhibition to specific TC neurons and thereby regulate the firing of TC neurons. This would have important implications for the timing of visually evoked postsynaptic responses. Previous studies of inhibition in brain slice preparations have demonstrated that disynaptic inhibition can be elicited by extracellular optic tract stimulation (Crunelli et al., 1988Crunelli V. Haby M. Jassik-Gerschenfeld D. Leresche N. Pirchio M. Cl−- and K+-dependent inhibitory postsynaptic potentials evoked by interneurones of the rat lateral geniculate nucleus.J.

Nature of inhibitory postsynaptic activity in developing relay cells of the lateral geniculate nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, in these experiments many RGC axons were coactivated; the resulting inhibition differs from that occurring under physiological conditions. Specifically, the relative timing of excitatory and inhibitory inputs is difficult to interpret due to simultaneous activation of RGC axons that may not normally be activated synchronously, particularly since the conduction velocities of these axons show considerable variability (Stanford, 1987Stanford L.R. W-cells in the cat retina: correlated morphological and physiological evidence for two distinct classes.J. Neurophysiol. 1987; 57: 218-244PubMed Google Scholar, Stone and Fukuda, 1974Stone J. Fukuda Y. Properties of cat retinal ganglion cells: a comparison of W-cells with X- and Y-cells.J. Neurophysiol. 1974; 37: 722-748PubMed Google Scholar). Use-dependent synaptic plasticity can shape the strength of inhibitory currents during trains of activity, further complicating measurements of the magnitude of inhibition under physiological conditions. Consequently, the magnitude and timing of inhibition under physiological conditions and its functional consequences remain unknown. Moreover, these are general issues that have limited our understanding of the functional role of inhibition in many brain regions. The functional consequences of feed-forward inhibition are determined not only by properties of the inhibition, but also by properties of the postsynaptic neurons. One important feature of TC neurons is their ability to function in either tonic or burst mode. In burst mode, which is most prominent during sleep, excitatory inputs elicit calcium spikes that are generated by T-type calcium channels, which leads to burst firing (Jahnsen and Llinas, 1984Jahnsen H. Llinas R. Ionic basis for the electroresponsiveness and oscillatory properties of guinea-pig thalamic neurones in vitro.J.

Tonic and burst firing: dual modes of thalamocortical relay.Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 122-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). In tonic mode, which is most prominent in the waking state, the potential of the neurons is sufficiently depolarized to inactivate T-type calcium channels (Sherman, 2001Sherman S.M. Tonic and burst firing: dual modes of thalamocortical relay.Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 122-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The influences of inhibitory currents are likely to differ between these two response modes. In this study, we characterized feed-forward inhibition within the LGN, but made use of the fact that each TC neuron receives a small number of large excitatory inputs from RGCs that can be activated in isolation (Chen and Regehr, 2000Chen C. Regehr W.G. Developmental remodeling of the retinogeniculate synapse.Neuron. 2000; 28: 955-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This approach allowed us to identify two distinct forms of inhibition. In a subset of neurons, the IPSC and EPSC had the same threshold, indicating that both arose through activation by the same RGC. Moreover, the IPSC faithfully followed the EPSC with a latency of 1 ms. These properties of locked inhibition suggest the involvement of a synaptic specialization within the LGN, known as the triad (Hamos et al., 1985Hamos J.E. Van Horn S.C. Raczkowski D. Uhlrich D.J.

Sci. 1984; 221: 411-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) (see Discussion). In the remaining neurons, inhibition was not locked to excitation, suggesting that it might be important in mediating surround inhibition. We refer to these forms of inhibition as “locked” and “nonlocked” inhibition, respectively. Although both types of inhibition were depressed during realistic activity patterns, this depression was more pronounced for locked IPSCs. Dynamic-clamp experiments indicated that locked inhibition has little influence on responses in burst mode. However, in tonic mode, locked inhibition controlled the number of spikes, prevented burst firing, and increased precise spiking. These findings indicate that interneurons within the LGN can increase the precision of responses in specific TC neurons. Extracellular stimulation of RGC axons and whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of TC neurons were used to study disynaptic inhibition in the LGN of P26–P32 mice (Figure 1A ). At this age, RGC input to each TC neuron is dominated by one to three strong inputs (Chen and Regehr, 2000Chen C. Regehr W.G. Developmental remodeling of the retinogeniculate synapse.Neuron. 2000; 28: 955-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). RGC axons were stimulated within the optic tract (Figure 1A), and monosynaptic glutamatergic currents mediated by AMPA receptors and disynaptic currents mediated by GABAA receptors were recorded in TC neurons. Experiments were performed under conditions in which feedback inhibition from the reticular nucleus (nRT) was eliminated by isolating the LGN from the nRT, which left interneurons within the LGN as the only remaining source of inhibition (Steriade et al., 1997Steriade M. Jones E.G. McCormick D.A. Thalamus, Vol I. Elsevier Science, Oxford1997Google Scholar). Our internal solution allowed separation of AMPA and GABAA currents, and we blocked NMDA currents to better isolate inhibitory currents. We found that a single RGC stimulus elicited a fast inward current followed by a slower outward current at a holding potential of −10 mV (Figure 1B, middle). At −60 mV, the short-latency inward current was observed in isolation (Figure 1B, bottom), while at +10 mV, the longer-latency outward current was observed in isolation (Figure 1B, top). In this example neuron, the current-voltage relationship of the AMPA component reversed at 10 mV, while the late component reversed at −60 mV, consistent with a Cl− mediated GABAA current (Figure 1C). The late component was eliminated by the GABAA receptor antagonists bicuculline (5–20 µM) (−0.03% ± 0.05% of control, n = 3) and picrotoxin (20 µM) (−0.003% ± 0.024% of control, n = 4) (data not shown). Thus, the late component is a GABAA receptor-mediated IPSC. Because the stimulus electrode was located in the optic tract greater than 1 mm from the LGN, interneurons could not be activated directly, so that the IPSCs must be disynaptic responses resulting from RGC axons activating interneurons within the LGN. Additionally, the AMPA antagonist NBQX (2–5 µM) blocked the EPSC (4.1% ± 0.3% of control) and eliminated the IPSC (0.4% ± 3.4% of control, n = 4) (data not shown). Extracellular stimulation within the optic tract can activate a variable number of RGC axons, depending on the stimulus intensity and the threshold of RGC fibers. Some RGCs may elicit disynaptic inhibition by activating interneurons that synapse onto the TC that is activated by the same RGC. However, disynaptic inhibition that influences a particular TC neuron might also arise from the activation of interneurons by RGCs that contact other TC neurons. We therefore performed experiments to distinguish between these possibilities. We first varied stimulus intensity and examined threshold for activation of EPSCs and IPSCs. We reasoned that if the same RGC input was responsible for direct TC activation and for disynaptic inhibition, then EPSC and IPSC activation should have the same threshold (i.e., the threshold for activation of the RGC). If an EPSC and an IPSC had distinct thresholds, it would indicate that the IPSC was due to interneuron activation by RGCs that did not directly synapse onto the TC neuron. We found that varying stimulus intensity revealed that synaptic inputs to TC neurons exhibited two distinct types of behaviors as typified by the two cells shown in Figures 1D and 1F. Stimulus electrode placement and stimulus intensity were adjusted in order to isolate a single large-amplitude excitatory RGC input to a TC neuron. We then examined the currents elicited by a range of stimulus intensities. In some cells, we found that inhibition was elicited at lower stimulus intensities than the excitatory inputs (Figure 1D). In this example, the IPSC amplitude continued to increase with increasing stimulus intensity, while there was only one discrete step increase in amplitude for the EPSC (Figure 1D). In this cell, a discrete change in the IPSC did not occur at the threshold for EPSC activation, and the average IPSC just below the EPSC threshold was very similar to the average IPSC elicited above the EPSC threshold (Figure 1D, top). This behavior suggested that inhibition in this neuron was elicited by activation of RGCs that do not synapse onto the recorded TC neuron (nonlocked), as illustrated in the schematic in Figure 1E. A very different circuit was suggested by the behavior of synaptic inputs onto other TC neurons. In a subset of recorded cells, the thresholds for IPSCs and EPSCs were the same (Figure 1F). This is demonstrated by the graph of EPSC and IPSC amplitudes as a function of stimulus intensity (Figure 1F, bottom), in which there was a discrete step increase in EPSC and IPSC amplitude at the same intensity. Additionally, a comparison of currents evoked above and below EPSC threshold illustrates that EPSCs and IPSCs share the same threshold (Figure 1F, top). As illustrated in Figure 1G, this behavior suggests that inhibition was mediated by an interneuron that received a synapse from the same RGC that synapsed onto the recorded TC neuron (locked). This inhibition could involve conventional axodendritic inhibition (Figure 1G, left) or dendrodendritic inhibition (Figure 1G, right), both of which occur at RGC-TC neuron connections in the LGN (Montero, 1991Montero V.M.

Thus, it appears that in some (Figure 1F), but not in all, cases (Figure 1D), the same RGC input both directly activates the TC neuron and elicits disynaptic inhibition by activating interneurons that contact the same TC neuron. We performed a second set of experiments to test for a single RGC eliciting excitation and disynaptic inhibition onto the same TC neuron. In these experiments, we determined the relationships between IPSC and EPSC activation by examining currents elicited at EPSC threshold. Synaptic currents were recorded over many (50–100) trials at EPSC threshold such that no EPSC was observed in about 50% of the trials. Based on the large size of the EPSC, which is evoked by many release sites (Chen and Regehr, 2000Chen C. Regehr W.G. Developmental remodeling of the retinogeniculate synapse.Neuron. 2000; 28: 955-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, Hamos et al., 1987Hamos J.E. Van Horn S.C. Raczkowski D. Sherman S.M. Synaptic circuits involving an individual retinogeniculate axon in the cat.J. Comp. Neurol. 1987; 259: 165-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), EPSC failures correspond to a failure to elicit an action potential in the RGC axon. Therefore, we expect that if both the disynaptic inhibition and the monosynaptic excitation are elicited by the same RGC axon, failure to activate the RGC axon will result in failure of both the EPSC and IPSC. Using this approach, we observed two types of synaptic inputs that are illustrated by two example cells (Figure 2). In one case, there was no difference in the IPSCs elicited regardless of whether the EPSC was activated, as shown in an example neuron (Figures 2A–2E). This was apparent when all the trials were superimposed (Figure 2A) and the EPSC failures (Figure 2B) and successes (Figure 2C) were compared. The averages of all failures and all successes demonstrated little difference in IPSC amplitude with and without an EPSC (Figure 2D), which the plot of IPSC amplitude against EPSC amplitude for all trials also demonstrates (Figure 2E). These data suggest that one or more RGC axons with a lower stimulus threshold elicit the IPSCs and that the RGC that elicits the EPSC does not contribute to feed-forward inhibition onto this TC neuron. As shown by another representative experiment (Figures 2F–2J), for some synaptic inputs IPSC and EPSC activation were tightly correlated. This is evident when EPSC failures and successes are separated (Figures 2G and 2H). In all cases, an EPSC failure was accompanied by an IPSC failure, and an EPSC success resulted in an IPSC success. This was also evident in the averages of EPSC failures and successes (Figure 2I) and in a plot of IPSC amplitude versus EPSC amplitude (Figure 2J). The tight link between an EPSC and an IPSC at EPSC threshold suggested that the IPSC was elicited by the same RGC axon that elicited the EPSC. In neurons in which there was no link between EPSC and IPSC, it was likely that the interneurons were activated by additional RGCs that did not make excitatory synapses onto the recorded TC neurons. We therefore separated the recorded disynaptic responses into two categories corresponding to “nonlocked,” as in Figures 2A–2E, and “locked,” as in Figures 2F–2J. The linkage between IPSC and EPSC threshold and distinct clusters of IPSC and EPSC amplitudes (as in Figure 2J) was used to identify locked inputs. In some cases, as stimulus intensities were increased, neurons that received “locked” inhibition also received additional IPSCs that were not locked to any additional EPSC. However, we were interested in inhibition relative to activation of the dominant RGC input to a TC neuron. Therefore, we categorized inhibition as locked or nonlocked based on whether there was a linkage to an EPSC as described. In 85 TC neurons examined, we used these criteria to classify inhibition in 34% of cells (29/85) as locked and in 60% (51/85), as nonlocked. In 6% (5/85) of cells, inputs could not be sufficiently isolated to make a definitive classification. A plot of IPSC amplitudes versus EPSC amplitudes above and below EPSC threshold illustrates the difference between the populations of synaptic inputs to TC neurons classified as nonlocked and locked. For the 51 nonlocked inputs, there was no apparent increase in IPSC amplitude at EPSC threshold (Figure 3A ), but for the 29 locked inputs, EPSC activation and increases in IPSC amplitude were tightly linked (Figure 3B). In some neurons, a single EPSC could not be isolated, but there was a clear difference in stimulus threshold for two EPSCs, and the change in IPSC amplitude from EPSC1 to EPSC2 was determined. The distinction between locked and nonlocked inhibition was also evident when the data were plotted as cumulative histograms (Figure 3C). There was a clear separation of the nonlocked (thin line) and locked (thick line) cumulative histograms (Figure 3C). In nonlocked neurons, there was no change in IPSC amplitude at EPSC threshold indicated by the steep rise at zero. Locked neurons, however, had a range of IPSC amplitude changes. These experiments show that inhibition within different TC neurons can have vastly different properties, and, in about a third of TC neurons, locked inhibition is observed. Timing is crucial for many neuronal computations (Rieke et al., 1997Rieke F. Warland D. de Ruyter van Stevenick R. Bialek W. Spikes: Exploring the Neural Code. The MIT Press, Cambridge1997Google Scholar, Usrey, 2002aUsrey W.M. The role of spike timing for thalamocortical processing.Curr. Opin.

It is difficult, however, to determine how the latency and magnitude of disynaptic inhibition elicited experimentally relates to that occurring physiologically. This is because disynaptic inhibition has been examined primarily with strong stimulation of fiber tracts that activates many presynaptic fibers (Bissiere et al., 2003Bissiere S. Humeau Y. Luthi A.

Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Scatter in the latency of synaptic inputs makes it difficult to interpret the latency difference between excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Moreover, it is not known whether the inputs that elicit the excitatory currents and the other inputs that activate interneurons are usually coactivated in vivo. These properties make it unlikely that the latency measured under these conditions is an accurate representation of the latency that is relevant for physiological conditions. These difficulties are highlighted by the wide range of latencies that we observed in nonlocked neurons. Examples of two extremes are shown in Figure 4. In Figure 4A, a low stimulus intensity (thick line) evoked an EPSC followed 1.7 ms later by an IPSC. The EPSC and IPSC had different thresholds and thus were nonlocked. At a higher intensity (Figure 4A, thin line), an additional IPSC was elicited that began before EPSC onset. Thus, for some cells the latency of inhibitory inputs was highly dependent upon the stimulus intensity, and inhibition could be elicited that initiated prior to the onset of an EPSC. In other cells, nonlocked IPSCs followed EPSCs with a long latency (Figure 4B). Differences in the conduction velocities of RGC axons (Stanford, 1987Stanford L.R. W-cells in the cat retina: correlated morphological and physiological evidence for two distinct classes.J. Neurophysiol. 1987; 57: 218-244PubMed Google Scholar, Stone and Fukuda, 1974Stone J. Fukuda Y. Properties of cat retinal ganglion cells: a comparison of W-cells with X- and Y-cells.J. Neurophysiol. 1974; 37: 722-748PubMed Google Scholar) likely contributed significantly to the wide range of latencies of IPSCs relative to EPSCs. These data indicate that the latencies of IPSCs are difficult to interpret in nonlocked cells (see Discussion). We therefore focused on the latency of locked IPSCs. The latency from EPSC to IPSC measured in cells with locked inhibition must reflect the latency that occurs under physiological conditions because a locked IPSC is evoked by a single RGC input. In an example neuron, the AMPA (Figure 4C, bottom) and GABAA (Figure 4C, top) components were isolated using reversal potentials of the two currents. The latency measured from EPSC to IPSC onset was 1.0 ms at 38°C. The overlay of AMPA and GABAA conductances further illustrates the very short latency between their onsets (Figure 4D). In the same neuron, the AMPA EPSC (Figure 4E, bottom) and the GABAA IPSC (Figure 4E, top) were isolated pharmacologically, and the conductances were calculated (Figure 4F). Using this approach, we again measured an EPSC to IPSC latency of 1.0 ms (38°C), a measurement in good agreement with the latency measured using reversal potentials in this example neuron (Figures 4C and 4D). Thus, latencies measured with these two techniques can be grouped together. Latency measurements made using these two methods were plotted over a range of temperatures (Figure 4G; n = 14). There was a decrease from 1.6 ms to 1.0 ms as the temperature increased. A histogram of EPSC to IPSC latencies measured at 37–38.5°C shows that the IPSC lagged the EPSC by 0.99 ± 0.12 ms (mean ± SD) (n = 7) (Figure 4H). Thus, when activated by the same RGC synapsing onto a TC neuron, local interneurons elicit disynaptic inhibition in that TC neuron with a latency of approximately 1 ms at physiological temperatures. This suggests that locked feed-forward inhibition could influence TC neuron responses. In addition to the timing and magnitude of inhibition, use-dependent plasticity can play an important role in the physiological consequences of feed-forward inhibition. Therefore, we next determined the plasticity of locked and nonlocked i"

HIV gp120 also binds to other cell surface components, including heparan sulfate (HS), a sulfated polysaccharide whose wide interactive properties are exploited by many pathogens for attachment and concentration at the cell surface. To analyze the structural features of gp120 binding to HS, we used soluble CD4 to constrain gp120 in a specific conformation. We first found that CD4 induced conformational change of gp120, dramatically increasing binding to HS. We then showed that HS binding interface on gp120 comprised, in addition to the well characterized V3 loop, a CD4-induced epitope. This epitope is efficiently targeted by nanomolar concentrations of size-defined heparin/HS-derived oligosaccharides. Because this domain of the protein also constitutes the binding site for the viral coreceptors, these results support an implication of HS at late stages of the virus-cell attachment process and suggest potential therapeutic applications.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; CD4i, CD4-induced; HP, heparin; HS, heparan sulfate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; sCD4, soluble CD4. adsorption and entry into potential target cells is initiated by the binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) to a set of cell surface molecules. This comprises both attachment receptors, including CD4 (1Klatzmann D. Champagne E. Chamaret S. Gruest J. Guetard D. Hercend T. Gluckman J.C. Montagnier L. Nature. 1984; 312: 767-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar) and heparan sulfate (HS) (2Ugolini S. Mondor I. Sattentau Q.J. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 144-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and entry receptors. The latter belong to the chemokine receptor family, among which CCR5 and CXCR4 are the most physiologically relevant (3Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). The surface envelope glycoprotein gp120 features all of the binding determinants for both attachment and entry receptors and constitutes the central element for all interactive events occurring during the pre-entry steps. Accordingly, this molecule is structurally complex and exhibits unusual features. It consists of a core structure organized into an inner domain, an outer domain, a bridging sheet spanning these two domains, which appears to be partially unfolded or disordered, and five surface-exposed variable loops, V1 to V5 (4Wyatt R. Sodroski J. Science. 1998; 280: 1884-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). Binding to CD4 triggers extensive structural alterations in gp120. These include shifts of the V1/V2 and V3 loops and drive the exposure and/or conformational changes of a region within the bridging sheet called the CD4-induced (CD4i) epitope (5Sattentau Q.J. Moore J.P. Vignaux F. Traincard F. Poignard P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7383-7393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wyatt R. Moore J. Accola M. Desjardin E. Robinson J. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5723-5733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In conjunction with the V3 loop, this region makes up the binding site for chemokine-receptors (7Rizzuto C.D. Wyatt R. Hernandez-Ramos N. Sun Y. Kwong P.D. Hendrickson W.A. Sodroski J. Science. 1998; 280: 1949-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 8Basmaciogullari S. Babcock G.J. Van Ryk D. Wojtowicz W. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10791-10800Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The V3 loop is also an essential determinant of HS recognition (9Roderiquez G. Oravecz T. Yanagishita M. Bou-Habib D. Mostowski H. Norcross M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HS is a sulfated polysaccharide of the glycosaminoglycan family characterized by wide interactive properties and critical functions in many biological processes (10Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar). In particular, a large number of viruses interact productively with HS, a binding that facilitates attachment to host cells and subsequent infection (11Spillmann D. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It has been known for a long time that removal of cell surface HS or the use of soluble glycosaminoglycans, including heparin (HP) and HS as competing agents, reduced both HIV attachment and infection on several cell lines, including CD4-positive HeLa cells, macrophages, and T-cell lines (12Ohshiro Y. Murakami T. Matsuda K. Nishioka K. Yoshida K. Yamamoto N. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 40: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Mondor I. Ugolini S. Sattentau Q.J. J.

HS was thus thought to increase infectivity by favoring viral particle concentration at the cell surface. However, recent evidence has suggested that the role of HS in HIV infection goes well beyond that of a low specificity pre-attachment site. In macrophages, HS can compensate for a low level of CD4 expression during viral attachment and modulate HIV replication (14Saphire A.C.S. Bobardt M.D. Zhang Z. David G. Gallay P.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9187-9200Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). HS expressed by CD4 negative brain endothelial cells has been shown to play a crucial role in HIV entry (15Argyris E.G. Acheampong E. Nunnari G. Mukhtar M. Williams K.J. Pomerantz R.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12140-12151Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that cell surface HS preserved HIV infectivity for days, enhanced in trans infectivity, and provided conditions that boosted replication in T-cells (16Bobardt M.D. Saphire A.C. Hung H.C. Yu X. Van der Schueren B. Zhang Z. David G. Gallay P.A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 27-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Using surface plasmon resonance to analyze the binding of gp120 to HS, we reported that this interaction did not fit any simple binding model (17Moulard M. Lortat-Jacob H. Mondor I. Roca G. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. Zhao L. Olson W. Kwong P.D. Sattentau Q.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1948-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This could be the result of the protein's intrinsic flexibility or indicate the existence of multiple binding motifs. A clarification of gp120/HS binding determinants would thus help in understanding the role of this interaction during infection and provide insights into unexplored modes of therapeutic intervention. To further characterize the binding of gp120 to HS, we investigated whether CD4-induced conformational change in gp120 had any impact on its HS binding properties. This was performed on gp120 from the laboratory-adapted HIV-1 isolate HXBc2, the core structure, receptor binding, and interaction of which with neutralizing antibodies are similar to those of a primary clinical isolate (18Kwong P.D.

We found that gp120 in its CD4-bound state had substantially increased binding to HS as compared with free gp120 and demonstrated by experimental analysis and molecular modeling that the HS binding site on gp120 is made up of the previously identified V3 loop and the CD4-induced, chemokine receptor binding region. Surface Plasmon Resonance-based Binding Assays—The surface of two B1 sensor chip flow cells (BIAcore) were activated with 50 μl of 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide. Then, the mAb 17b (5 μg/ml in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 5) was injected at 5 μl/min over one of the two surfaces to get an immobilization level of 500 resonance units. The other flow cell served as a negative control. The remaining free activated groups were blocked with 50 μl of ethanolamine (1 m), pH 8.5. HP (Sanofi) and HS (Celsus) surfaces were prepared as described (19Sadir R. Baleux F. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8288-8296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Binding assays were performed at 25 °C at a flow rate of 10 μl/ml in HBS-EP (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4). Samples for analysis (gp120, preincubated or not with soluble CD4 (sCD4) and/or competitors) were injected over the mAb or the HP surfaces, after which the complexes formed were washed with HBS-EP. HP and mAb surfaces were regenerated by injection of 1 m NaCl (5 min) and 10 mm HCl (1 min), respectively. Modeling of the gp120-heparin Complex—The coordinates of the crystal structure of the HIV gp120 glycoprotein complexed with sCD4 and mAb17b (18Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Majeed S. Robinson J. Sweet R.W.

The mAb 17b recognition site on gp120 includes residues that determine the coreceptor interaction, and the antibody footprint is thought to mark the coreceptor site (7Rizzuto C.D. Wyatt R.

Science. 1998; 280: 1949-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) Thus, in this structure gp120 is believed to be in a post-attachment state. Only the atoms of the gp120 core structure were considered. Hydrogen atoms were added and optimized and partial atomic charges were derived using the Pullman procedure within the SYBYL software (20Inc Tripos SYBYL. Tripos Inc., St Louis, MO1997Google Scholar). Connolly surfaces and energy contours for interaction with sulfate groups were calculated using the MOLCAD (21Waldherr-Teschner M. Goetze T. Heiden W.

J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (2487) Google Scholar), respectively. The probe used in the calculation was the charged oxygen of a sulfate group, and the grid spacing was set to 1 Å. The loop search method of the SYBYL software, based on a library of three-dimensional loop structures, was used to build the V3 peptide using the HXBc2 amino acid sequence. A series of conformations were generated and investigated. The selected conformation, a hairpin form with two β-strands associated in antiparallel way, displayed strong similarity with the V3 loop conformation demonstrated by NMR study (23Sharon M. Kessler N. Levy R. Zolla-Pazner S. Gorlach M. Anglister J. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 225-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Different models of heparin fragments were taken from a homemade conformational library, the construction of which has been described in detail previously (supporting information of Ref. 24Lortat-Jacob H.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14779-14789Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These fragments varied in length, in the occurrence of 2S0 and 1C4 ring shapes for the iduronic acid, and in the conformations at each glycosidic linkage that were randomly chosen from the energy minima of the conformational maps calculated previously (26Cros S. Petitou M. Sizun P. Pérez S. Imberty A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 27Mikhailov D. Linhardt R.J. Mayo K.H. Biochem.

From this library, the oligosaccharides that displayed a shape appropriate for fitting their sulfate groups with the lowest GRID-determined iso-energy contours of gp120 were selected. The polysaccharide chains were merged with the protein structure in the docking mode that brings the sulfate in close contact with the protein surface without generating steric conflicts. The geometry of each of these complexes was optimized by several cycles of energy minimization. Hydrogen atoms and pendent groups were optimized first. Finally the whole heparin moiety, together with the side chains of the amino acids in the positively charged area, were fully optimized. All energy calculations were performed with the Tripos force field (29Clark M. Cramer R.D.I. van den Opdenbosch N. J. Comput.

CD4 Enhances gp120 Binding to Heparin—The binding of gp120 to HP (Fig. 1, light lines) is known to involve the V3 loop of the glycoprotein. Previous studies indicated that this interaction did not follow a simple binding process, consistent with the view that gp120 could assume several distinct conformations, each of them having, in principle, the ability to bind to HP with distinct affinities. To investigate further the gp120/HP interaction, we made use of CD4, which constrains the glycoprotein into a specific “CD4-bound” conformation. For that purpose, gp120, either alone or complexed with sCD4, was injected over a HP-activated sensor chip. In the presence of sCD4, a dramatic increase in gp120 binding was observed (Fig. 1, heavy line). The injection of sCD4 alone did not produce any significant binding response (not shown). The effect was maximal at low gp120 concentrations (1.25–5 nm; Fig. 1, A–C) at which virtually no binding could be detected in the absence of sCD4. HS has usually been considered as a preliminary binding site that would simply enhance HIV concentration at the cell surface before any other tight binding events take place (12Ohshiro Y. Murakami T. Matsuda K. Nishioka K. Yoshida K. Yamamoto N. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 40: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, evidence in the present study showing that CD4 binding makes gp120 a much better HS ligand suggests rather that HS may interact with gp120 after the cell surface CD4 and, thus, that it may also play some role in post-attachment mechanisms (see below). One of the conformational changes induced by CD4 is the shift of the V1/V2 and V3 loops. A first hypothesis would thus be that CD4-induced conformational changes of gp120 could favor HS binding by improving accessibility of the V3 loop and/or stabilizing its structure into a conformation better recognized by HS. However, molecular dynamic analyses indicated that if binding to CD4 substantially decreased the mobility of several regions of gp120, the V3 loop, although displaced, remains highly mobile (30Hsu S.T. Bonvin A.M. Proteins. 2004; 55: 582-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, a survey of the structural features of HS binding domains in a variety of proteins showed no absolute dependence on protein fold (31Mulloy B. Linhardt R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data make it unlikely that V3 loop structural change would dramatically modify HS binding. Alternatively, sCD4 binding could trigger the display of new HS binding motifs within gp120. The CD4i Region on gp120 Displays Features of a Typical Heparin Binding Site—A molecular modeling approach was used to locate putative HP binding sites on the core structure of gp120. This approach was initially developed and experimentally validated for analysis of the chemokine family, of which all members bind HP (24Lortat-Jacob H. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Examination of the gp120 electrostatic surface, using the structural data of the core glycoprotein in the CD4-bound form, revealed that the CD4i region was the most likely HP binding site. In particular, amino acids Lys-121, Arg-419, Lys-421, and Lys-432 form a cluster of positively charged residues located between the stems of the V1/V2 and V3 loops and are organized as a possible HP binding site (Fig. 2A). This discontinuous surface has a linear shape extending up to 25 Å and can accommodate an oligosaccharide of eight sugar residues in length (Fig. 2, B and C). This observation was confirmed by a GRID analysis of the gp120 surface that was used to predict the most favorable anchoring position group, with an oxygen atom from a sulfate group serving as a probe for the calculation (not shown). Heparin and Heparin-derived Oligosaccharides Inhibit the Binding of mAb 17b to gp120 in the Presence of sCD4—To assess the molecular modeling predictions of a HP-binding surface overlapping the CD4i region, we immobilized mAb 17b onto a sensor chip. mAb 17b belongs to the CD4i antibody family and recognizes an epitope on the gp120 bridging sheet that is exposed upon CD4 binding (32Wyatt R. Kwong P.D. Desjardins E. Sweet R.W. Robinson J. Hendrickson W.A. Sodroski J.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Such mAbs, whose epitopes overlap the gp120 coreceptor binding domain, are widely used in interaction assays as coreceptor surrogates. In the absence of sCD4, a low concentration of gp120 (5 nm) failed to significantly interact with the 17b immobilized sensor chip surface (not shown). In contrast, the gp120/sCD4 complex, in which the CD4i region is optimally presented, bound well to 17b (Fig. 3A, top curve). Pre-incubation of gp120/sCD4 complexes with HP reduced binding to the 17b-activated surface, with an almost complete inhibition at concentrations as low as 16 nm (Fig. 3A, bottom curve). It is worth noting that among the four basic amino acids that we predicted would interact with HP, three of them (Lys-121, Arg-419, and Lys-421) are involved in mAb 17b recognition (7Rizzuto C.D. Wyatt R. Hernandez-Ramos N. Sun Y. Kwong P.D. Hendrickson W.A. Sodroski J. Science. 1998; 280: 1949-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Our experimental observation of mAb 17b/HP competition for binding to gp120 thus supports our model further. Similar results were obtained when the related mAb 48d was substituted for 17b and HS was used instead of HP (not shown). Because HP is an extended molecule that can bridge several contact sites along the same protein, HP-derived oligosaccharides of define length were used to compete with 17b for binding to the CD4i epitope. Fragments ranging from disaccharides (dp2) to octadecasaccharides (dp18) were prepared (19Sadir R. Baleux F. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8288-8296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), preincubated with gp120/sCD4, and injected over the 17b-activated surface. Results indicated that the shortest fragments (dp2–6) did not efficiently compete with 17b for binding to gp120 and that octasaccharides (dp8) reduced the interaction to an intermediate degree, whereas longer oligosaccharides (dp10–18) efficiently inhibited the interaction (Fig. 3B). These results provide an experimental support for the model depicted in Fig. 2 in which an octasaccharide is the minimal length enabling interaction of the sugar carboxyl and sulfate groups with the basic amino acids within the CD4i region. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that the bridging sheet structure constitutes a new heparin binding domain on the protein. The structure of an unliganded simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) gp120 core has just been determined (33Chen B. Vogan E.M. Gong H. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Harrison S.C. Nature. 2005; 433: 834-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Very interestingly, a comparison of the unliganded SIV gp120 core and the CD4-bound HIV gp120 core revealed that CD4 binding induces roughly half of the protein to refold. In particular, the bridging sheet structure found in the CD4-bound gp120, composed of four β-strands (β2, β3, β20, and β21), is absent in the unliganded state of the protein where β2-β3 and β20-β21 are spaced apart on the structure (33Chen B. Vogan E.M. Gong H. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Harrison S.C. Nature. 2005; 433: 834-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Thus, the reorganization of gp120 induced by CD4 binding, rather than by exposing a previously masked surface, brings together the residues Lys-121 (in the β2-strand) and Lys-421 and Lys-432 (in the β20-β21 strands) that collectively form a new HP binding surface. Protein-HP binding is well known to induce protein conformational changes. The most documented example is that of antithrombin III, the binding of which to activated factor X is dependent on such HP-induced modifications (34Olson S.T. Bjork I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the present work is probably one of the first examples in which a protein-induced conformational change primed another protein for HP recognition. The importance of sulfate groups for CD4i domain binding has already been described, as the N-terminal domains of both CCR5 and CXCR4 that are involved in gp120 recognition feature a number of sulfotyrosines that contribute to HIV entry (35Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Similarly, most of the anti CD4i antibodies display sulfotyrosines in their antigen binding sites (36Choe H. Li W. Wright P.L. Vasilieva N. Venturi M. Huang C.C. Grundner C. Dorfman T. Zwick M.B. Wang L. Rosenberg E.S. Kwong P.D. Burton D.R. Robinson J.E. Sodroski J.G. Farzan M. Cell. 2003; 114: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The binding of HS with the CD4i region may thus mimic, to some extent, the interaction taking place with CD4i antibodies or the N-terminal domain of the coreceptors. Because the CD4i region comprises the coreceptor binding site, another important aspect of our study is that HP binds to the same surface as the CXCR4 coreceptor. This finding identifies the CD4i region as a potential target-using compound based on heparin-like structures (see below). The V3 Loop and the CD4i Epitope Form a Single Extended Heparin Binding Site on the gp120 Surface—To study further the structural basis of gp120/HP interaction, the V3 loop that was missing in the available x-ray structure of gp120 was modeled and replaced on the protein core. Conformations of the V3 loop are available from NMR (23Sharon M. Kessler N. Levy R. Zolla-Pazner S. Gorlach M. Anglister J. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 225-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and crystallography (37Stanfield R.L. Gorny M.K. Williams C. Zolla-Pazner S. Wilson I.A. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 193-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In these structural studies the loop is bound to an antibody and not connected to the gp120 core, and, therefore, a molecular modeling approach was preferred here. Among the large panel of possible conformations, an extended β-hairpin close to the NMR conformation was selected. (Fig. 4). Such a shape was predicted to not interfere with oligomerization (18Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Majeed S. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1329-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this model the basic sequence located at the V3 loop stem lined up with the HP binding site on the CD4i surface to form an extended binding domain. Various HP fragments selected from a library of oligosaccharide conformations were docked onto the gp120 V3 loop using the Tripos force field energy calculation. A tetradecasaccharide (dp14) enabled the bridging of CD4i and V3 loop binding sites (Fig. 4). Although V3 loop interaction with HP/HS is well established, the amino acids involved in the binding have not been identified. Our data suggest an involvement of Arg-304, Arg-306, Arg-308, and Arg-327 within the V3 loop. Because the V3 loop is predicted to be flexible, a variety of other shapes could be accommodated. Nevertheless, taking into account the flexibility of HP and the location of the CD4i region at the V3 loop stem, it is most likely that the polysaccharide could accommodate any V3 loop conformation and still interact with both binding regions. Experimental data will be required to confirm the importance of the amino acids for HP binding in both regions. These aspects will be investigated, either by using the “beads sequencing approach” reported recently (38Vives R.R. Crublet E. Andrieu J.-P. Gagnon J. Rousselle P. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54327-54333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or by site-directed mutagenesis. The physiological role of HS/CD4i interaction that we described here remains unclear but may shed light on the observation that cell surface HS enhances the infection of isolates that feature a highly positively charged V3 loop sequence (X4) but either has no effect on or inhibits infection by other (R5) strains (39Zhang Y.-J. Hatziioannou T. Zang T. Braaten D. Luban J. Goff S.P. Bieniasz P.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6332-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It has been calculated that, over a distance and with a high charge, the contribution of the V3 loop dominates gp120 electrostatic potential, a feature that could be used for initial attraction of the viral Env toward the cell surface before CD4 engagement and is consistent with the HS-mediated increase in infectivity. However, at short distances and with a low V3 loop charge, the protein core contributes more significantly to the electrostatic potential (40Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Sattentau Q.J. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In such a situation, the only HS binding area, the CD4i epitope, would be exposed after CD4 engagement at the cell surface. The possible competition between coreceptor and HS for interaction with the CD4i surface may therefore explain the inhibitory activity of cell surface HS toward R5 HIV strains. Finally, one implication of this study concerns polyanion-based inhibitors of HIV interactions with both attachment and entry receptors. Among the most promising recent approaches is the blockade of viral entry into target cells (41Moore J.P. Stevenson M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and the polyanionic compounds that are about to enter phase III efficacy trials as microbicides (42Stone A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Based on the finding that the highly conserved coreceptor binding region directly interacts with HS after CD4 binding, we are currently investigating the covalent linkage between sCD4- and HS-derived oligosaccharides. Such a molecule would bind to gp120 through its CD4 moiety and expose or fold the CD4i domain, which would then become available for interaction with the oligosaccharide. This molecule would thus simultaneously block the binding of the virus to the cell surface HS, CD4, and the coreceptor. We thank J. Sodroski and R.

The storage of long-term memory is represented at the cellular level by activity-dependent modulation of both the function and structure of specific synaptic connections (Bailey and Kandel, 1993Bailey C.H.

Although a number of molecular components that underlie the functional changes associated with memory storage have been characterized, little is known about how these are regulated by and coupled to the signaling pathways that give rise to the synaptic structural changes. Studies of the synaptic connections between identified sensory and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia have shown that both long-term sensitization in the behaving animal (Bailey and Chen, 1983Bailey C.H.

In culture, these structural changes can be correlated directly with the functional state of individual presynaptic varicosities (Kim et al., 2003Kim J.-H. Udo H. Li H.-L. Youn T.Y. Chen M. Kandel E.R. Bailey C.H.

Recent studies in the mammalian CNS further suggest that experience-dependent remodeling and the growth of new synaptic connections might also play a role in more complex neuronal networks by modulating and perhaps reconfiguring the activity of the neural network in which this occurs (Krucker et al., 2000Krucker T. Siggins G.R. Halpain S. Dynamic actin filaments are required for stable long-term potentiation (LTP) in area CA1 of the hippocampus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

LTP promotes formation of multiple spine synapses between a single axon terminal and a dendrite.Nature. 1999; 402: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). One of the critical steps in initiating activity-dependent synaptic remodeling is thought to be the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (Matus, 2000Matus A. Actin-based plasticity in dendritic spines.Science. 2000; 290: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Although modulation of actin dynamics at postsynaptic spines has recently received attention, the role of actin rearrangements in the presynaptic compartment is less clear (Sankaranarayanan et al., 2003Sankaranarayanan S.

Rapid increase in clusters of presynaptic proteins at onset of long-lasting potentiation.Science. 2000; 294: 1547-1550Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To examine the molecular mechanisms that underlie learning-related synaptic growth, we have exploited the experimental accessibility of Aplysia, where individual sensory and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex can be cultured and where the presynaptic structural changes associated with long-term synaptic plasticity are particularly robust. We find that the signaling pathway of ApCdc42, a member of the Rho family of GTPases, is required for both the functional and structural changes that underlie LTF in Aplysia. Our results indicate that repeated pulses of serotonin (5-HT) induce the spatial and temporal regulation of ApCdc42 activity at a specific subset of sensory neuron presynaptic varicosities. The 5-HT-induced activation of ApCdc42 is dependent on both the PI3 kinase and PLC pathways and, in turn, recruits the downstream effectors neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) and p21-Cdc42/Rac-activated kinase (PAK) to regulate reorganization of the presynaptic actin network. This initial molecular cascade leads to the outgrowth of filopodia, which represent one of the morphological precursors for the growth of new sensory neuron varicosities associated with the storage of long-term memory. In Aplysia sensory-motor neuron cocultures, process outgrowth as well as the formation of new sensory neuron varicosities induced by 5-HT require reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (Hatada et al., 2000Hatada Y. Wu F. Sun Z.Y. Schacher S. Goldberg D.J. Presynaptic morphological changes associated with long-term synaptic facilitation are triggered by actin polymerization at preexisting varicosities.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: RC82PubMed Google Scholar). To further study the role of actin, we first examined the effect of cytochalasin D (CytD), an inhibitor of actin polymerization, on LTF induced by five pulses of 10 μM 5-HT (Figure 1A ). When CytD (1 μM) was added, LTF measured at 24 hr was reduced by about half (5-HT + CytD, 67% ± 18%, n = 8, p < 0.05 versus 5-HT, 129% ± 29%, n = 10), whereas CytD by itself had no effect (CytD, 3.6% ± 25%, n = 10, p = 0.49 versus no 5-HT, 4.1% ± 8.2%, n = 9). Actin polymerization in response to extracellular stimuli is often regulated by the Rho family of GTPases (Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2003Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Rho GTPases in cell biology.Nature. 2003; 420: 629-635Crossref Scopus (3657) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether Clostridium difficile toxin B (ToxB), an inhibitor for the Rho family of GTPases (Aktories, 1997Aktories K. Rho proteins: targets for bacterial toxins.Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 282-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), also blocks LTF. When ToxB (500 ng/ml) was added to cultures following five pulses of 5-HT, LTF at 24 hr was significantly reduced (5-HT + ToxB, 31% ± 18%, n = 9, p < 0.01 versus 5-HT) (Figure 1A). ToxB alone did not affect basal synaptic transmission (ToxB, 9% ± 14%, n = 7, p = 0.39 versus no 5-HT) We next examined the effects of ToxB and CytD on short-term facilitation (STF) induced by a single pulse of 10 μM 5-HT (Figure 1B). In control cells, 5-HT produced a significant increase in the amplitude of EPSPs measured at 5 min (5-HT control, 71% ± 14%, n = 9, p < 0.0001 versus no 5-HT, −20% ± 2.5%, n = 7). When ToxB was added 3 hr prior to stimulation, STF was unaffected and was similar to 5-HT controls (5-HT + ToxB, 63% ± 22%, n = 11, p = 0.38 versus 5-HT). STF also was not blocked by application of 1 μM CytD (5-HT + CytD, 57% ± 14%, n = 13, p = 0.24 versus 5-HT). Control cells (no 5-HT stimulation) displayed homosynaptic depression (−20% ± 2.5%, n = 7) as previously described (Rayport and Schacher, 1986Rayport S.G. Schacher S. Synaptic plasticity in vitro: cell culture of identified Aplysia neurons mediating short-term habituation and sensitization.J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 759-763PubMed Google Scholar), and neither ToxB nor CytD alone altered the level of depression (ToxB, −21% ± 2.8%, n = 16, p = 0.43; CytD, −25% ± 2.1%, n = 16, p = 0.07 versus no 5-HT). To further differentiate whether it is the pre- or the postsynaptic cell that critically requires the Rho GTPases, we injected ToxB (50 ng/ml) into either the presynaptic sensory neuron or the postsynaptic motor neuron L7 (Figure 1C). Injection of ToxB into the sensory neuron reduced LTF at 24 hr (SN/ToxB + 5-HT, 35% ± 18%, n = 11, p < 0.01 versus 5-HT, 110% ± 17%, n = 9), whereas injection of ToxB into the motor neuron resulted in only a slight reduction that was not statistically significant (MN/ToxB + 5-HT, 91% ± 16%, n = 11, p = 0.21 versus 5-HT). Injection into either sensory or motor neurons alone did not alter basal transmission (SN/ToxB, 15% ± 7.1%, n = 9; MN/ToxB, 13% ± 8.0%, n = 9). To examine the effect of ToxB on learning-related synaptic growth, sensory neurons were injected with 5-carboxyfluorescein, and changes in the number of sensory neuron varicosities in contact with the initial segment and the cell body of motor neurons were counted before (−3 hr) and 24 hr after repeated pulses of 5-HT (Figures 1D and 1E). Control cells displayed a 34% ± 15% (n = 10) increase in the number of varicosities at 24 hr, consistent with previous reports (Glanzman et al., 1990Glanzman D.L. Kandel E.R. Schacher S.

In contrast, sensory neurons treated with ToxB showed no increase in the number of varicosities (5-HT + ToxB, 0.4% ± 2.7%, n = 13, p < 0.05 versus 5-HT) and were consistently associated with reduced levels of LTF (5-HT + ToxB, 20% ± 12%, n = 13, p < 0.01 versus 5-HT, 76% ± 17%, n = 10). Analysis of the net gain and loss of varicosities indicated that the growth of new varicosities was selectively inhibited by ToxB, whereas the loss of varicosities was unaffected (5-HT + ToxB, 8.7% ± 2.6% gain, 10.4% ± 0.1% loss, versus 5-HT, 48% ± 4.6% gain, 12% ± 0.3% loss). To identify which members of the Rho family of GTPases are required for both LTF and synaptic growth, we screened the cDNAs for Aplysia Rho GTPases. The cDNAs encoding Rac and Cdc42 were successfully isolated, whereas Rho was cloned by a RT-PCR based on the submitted sequence (Madaule and Axel, 1985Madaule P. Axel R. A novel ras-related gene family.Cell. 1985; 41: 31-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, we did not succeed in isolating other GTPases such as RhoG. The deduced amino acid sequences for Aplysia Cdc42, Rac, and Rho (designated as ApCdc42, ApRac, and ApRho, respectively) showed high sequence homology with their mammalian counterparts (Figure 2A ). The N-terminal domain that contains both a GTP binding site and an effector binding site are almost identical, suggesting that the intrinsic properties of the signaling pathway that link to either activators (such as guanine nucleotide exchange factors) or effectors (such as GTPase-activating proteins and downstream kinases) are conserved. The threonine residue at site 35 of ApRac and ApCdc42 or at site 37 of ApRho, which is the target glycosylation site for Clostridium difficile ToxB, is also conserved. In contrast, the C-terminal domain is more variable, especially, the C-terminal ∼10 residues highly enriched in positively charged amino acids. The cysteine residue at the fourth position from the C terminus is conserved across species, which is required for membrane association. The mRNA expression of ApRho, ApRac, and ApCdc42 was examined by Northern blot analysis (Figure 2B) and showed that mRNAs for all three GTPases are expressed in ganglia and gave rise to distinct signals (2.4 and 3.3 kb for ApRho, 4.8 kb for ApRac, and 5.6 kb for ApCdc42). 5-HT stimulation does not affect the level of mRNA expression, suggesting that the transcription of these GTPases is not dependent on 5-HT. We have also performed in situ hybridization to examine the mRNA expression in sensory-motor neuron cultures (Figure 2C). Every antisense probe detected mRNAs of Aplysia Rho GTPases in both sensory and motor neurons, whereas the sense control did not. To identify which specific GTPases are required for the functional and structural changes induced by 5-HT, we constructed dominant-negative mutants of the Aplysia Rho GTPases (ApRhoT19N, ApRacT17N, and ApCdc42T17N). GTPases were fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and expressed in sensory neurons (Figure 3A ). GFP fluorescence was observed as early as 6 hr after the DNA injection, and the expression level reached a plateau by 24 hr, which lasted at least 2–3 days. The subcellular distribution of Rho GTPases was similar to that of GFP alone or a fluorescent dye and was found throughout the entire neuron, including the cell body, axonal processes, and presynaptic varicosities. Since GFP-fused Rho GTPases are expressed cell-wide, we were able to monitor directly the structural changes at individual sensory neuron varicosities induced by 5-HT (Figure 3B). We found that expression of ApCdc42T17N in sensory neurons resulted in a significant reduction in the formation of new presynaptic varicosities (ApCdc42T17N + 5-HT, 2.6% ± 6.1%, n = 9, p < 0.01 versus control + 5-HT, 25% ± 6.5%, n = 12; Figure 3C). In contrast, expression of ApRacT17N or ApRhoT19N did not block the 5-HT-induced growth of new varicosities (ApRacT17N + 5-HT, 24% ± 10%, n = 11, p = 0.46, ApRhoT19N + 5-HT, 14% ± 5.0%, n = 10, p = 0.08 versus control + 5-HT). The expression of ApCdc42T17N did not completely block 5-HT-induced synaptic growth when compared to untreated controls (without 5-HT, −14% ± 3.5%, n = 11, p < 0.05 versus with 5-HT, 2.6% ± 6.1%, n = 9), suggesting that other signaling pathways may also participate in the 5-HT-induced long-term structural plasticity. Similarly, presynaptic expression of ApCdc42T17N significantly reduced the level of LTF at 24 hr (ApCdc42T17N + 5HT, 40% ± 14%, n = 9, p < 0.01 versus 5-HT, 92% ± 12%, n = 13) (Figure 3D), whereas expression of ApRacT17N or ApRhoT19N did not (ApRacT17N + 5HT, 74% ± 30%, n = 14, p = 0.30 versus 5-HT; ApRhoT19N + 5HT, 114% ± 32%, n = 13, p = 0.26 versus 5-HT). To determine whether 5-HT activates ApCdc42, a Cdc42 pull-down assay was performed (Figure 4A ). The active form (GTP bound), but not the inactive form (GDP bound), of Cdc42 specifically interacts with CRIB domains of downstream effectors such as N-WASP (Miki et al., 1998Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Induction of filopodium formation by a WASP-related actin-depolymerizing protein N-WASP.Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). We therefore utilized N-WASP-CRIB to selectively pull down the active form of ApCdc42. Protein extracts from Aplysia ganglia treated with 5-HT for 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 hr were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads bound to glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-N-WASP-CRIB. We found that the amount of active ApCdc42 increased significantly 3 hr after 5-HT treatment and reached a peak at 6 hr. In contrast, the total amount of ApCdc42 remained at similar levels. We next asked whether PAK (Manser et al., 1994Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. A brain serine/threonine protein kinase activated by Cdc42 and Rac1.Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar) is also upregulated by 5-HT. Western blot analysis with two independent anti-PAK1 antibodies detected a major band of ∼70 kDa, which matched well with the molecular weight of mammalian PAK (data not shown). Protein extracts were prepared from Aplysia ganglia stimulated with 5-HT for 0, 2, and 4 hr. PAK was immunoprecipitated and served for the protein kinase assay with myelin basic protein (MBP) as a substrate (Figure 4B). 5-HT stimulation resulted in the activation of PAK at 2 hr, and its activity increased by 4 hr. When the purified Cdc42G12V (2.5 μM) was added to fully activate PAK, the phosphorylation level of MBP was significantly enhanced. The inactivation of Cdc42 blocks both LTF and the growth of new varicosities. We therefore also overexpressed the CRIB domains of PAK (specific for both Rac and Cdc42) or N-WASP (specific for Cdc42) to sequester the activated form of ApCdc42 and examined their effect on long-term synaptic plasticity. The CRIB domain was fused with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and overexpressed in sensory neurons (Figure 4C). Since our data suggested that inhibition of the Rho pathway does not block LTF, we also included a Rho binding domain (RBD) of Rhotekin (Reid et al., 1996Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. Rhotekin, a new putative target for Rho bearing homology to a serine/threonine kinase, PKN, and rhophilin in the rho-binding domain.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) as a control. Overexpression of the CRIB domains from N-WASP and PAK significantly blocked LTF at 24 hr (N-WASP-CRIB, 18% ± 14%, n = 6, p < 0.05 and PAK-CRIB, 25% ± 15%, n = 8, p < 0.05 versus control, 112% ± 28%, n = 13) (Figure 4D, left). However, there was no significant difference in cells expressing Rhotekin-RBD (Rtkn-RBD, 154% ± 21%, n = 19, p = 0.11 versus control). Similarly, the 5-HT-induced growth of new varicosities at 24 hr was also blocked by overexpression of the CRIB domains (N-WASP-CRIB, −5.8% ± 5.1%, n = 8, p < 0.01 and PAK-CRIB, −7.3% ± 4.9%, n = 13, p < 0.01 versus control, 22% ± 6.6%, n = 13) but not by the expression of Rhotekin-RBD (21% ± 9.7%, n = 18, p = 0.50) (Figure 4D, right). To confirm these results, dominant-negative mutants of PAK and WASP were constructed and expressed in sensory neurons (Figure 4E, left). We found that expression of N-WASP lacking its VCA domain (Miki et al., 1996Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. N-WASP, a novel actin-depolymerizing protein, regulates the cortical cytoskeletal rearrangement in a PIP2-dependent manner downstream of tyrosine kinases.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) blocked LTF (N-WASPΔVCA, −10% ± 14%, n = 15, p < 0.0001 versus control, 93% ± 19%, n = 10) as well as the 5-HT-induced growth of new varicosities (N-WASPΔVCA, 2.0% ± 4.2%, n = 7, p < 0.01 versus control, 17% ± 3.9%, n = 9). However, a PAK1 mutant lacking the kinase activity (Kiosses et al., 1999Kiosses W.B. Daniels R.H. Otey C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. A role for p21-activated kinase in endothelial cell migration.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 831-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) did not significantly reduce the level of facilitation (PAK1ΔKD, 56% ± 32%, n = 9, p = 0.20 versus control) or the growth of new varicosities (PAK1ΔKD, 7.2% ± 7.7%, n = 9, p = 0.12 versus control). In other experiments, we have found that N-WASPΔVCA but not PAK1ΔKD effectively inhibited the ApCdc42-dependent formation of filopodia in sensory neurons (data not shown). These findings may be explained in part by the possibility that deletion of the kinase domain of PAK1 alters proper folding of the protein, resulting in only partial exposure of the CRIB domain and thus incomplete inhibition. An additional possibility is suggested by the findings that kinase-defective mutants of PAK can still induce membrane ruffling or lamellipodia formation (Bagrodia and Cerione, 1999Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Pak to the future.Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of PAK contains several functional domains (such as a proline-rich domain), which can serve as scaffolds for Cool/Pix and Cat/Git/PKI proteins to transduce signals for actin regulation. Thus, some signaling pathways may bypass the PAK-negative mutant but not CRIB. Nevertheless, our data indicate that PAK is activated by 5-HT—which is dependent on the activation of Cdc42—and that overexpression of the CRIB domain of PAK blocks both LTF and 5-HT-induced synaptic growth, suggesting that the PAK-LIMK-actin pathway is involved in the long-term synaptic changes but may ultimately contribute less than the N-WASP signaling cascade. To characterize the morphological phenotype of ApCdc42, we constructed a constitutively active mutant (G12V) and expressed the GFP-fused protein in sensory neurons (Figure 5A ). Expression of ApCdc42G12V resulted in the formation of numerous filopodia (5–30 μm in length and <1 μm in width) from the surface of the cell body, axonal processes, and presynaptic varicosities (G12V, 1.4 ± 0.26/10 μm, n = 6, p < 0.001 and 2.9 ± 0.76/varicosity, n = 8, p < 0.01 versus control, 0.074 ± 0.025/10 μm, n = 11 and 0.17 ± 0.062/varicosity, n = 12). In contrast, ApCdc42T17N reduced the filopodia number (T17N, 0.19 ± 0.061/10 μm, n = 9 and 0.28 ± 0.059/varicosity, n = 10; Figure 5B). Interestingly, we found that 5-HT stimulation by itself induces filopodia from varicosities in control sensory neurons and that this is blocked by ApCdc42T17N (control 24 hr, 0.62 ± 0.16/varicosity, n = 12, p < 0.05 versus control −3 hr, 0.17 ± 0.062/varicosity, n = 12). To confirm that the structures induced by ApCdc42 are based on the presynaptic actin cytoskeleton, we coexpressed cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-ApCdc42G12V and YFP-actin in sensory neurons (Figure 5C). ApCdc42G12V expression induced filopodia, in which both actin and ApCdc42 were colocalized. When CytD (1 μM) was included in cultures after DNA injection, the formation of Cdc42-dependent filopodia was completely abolished, although the expression of YFP-actin and CFP-ApCdc42G12V was clearly identified in these cells. Expression of ApCdc42G12V in sensory neurons occluded LTF induced by 5-HT (5-HT, 46% ± 17%, n = 10, p = 0.08 versus no 5-HT, 8.5% ± 20%, n = 7; p = 0.013 in control). Similarly, the number of varicosities at 24 hr was not significantly increased in ApCdc42G12V cells (5-HT, 14% ± 7.1%, n = 8, p = 0.18 versus no 5-HT, 6.5% ± 3.5%, n = 7; p < 0.001 in control) (Figure 5D). These results confirm our previous findings that ApCdc42 is a key component of the molecular cascade required for both the functional and structural changes associated with LTF. If filopodia formation represents one of the initial morphological steps in learning-related synaptic growth, expression of active ApCdc42 may be able to induce new varicosities in the absence of 5-HT stimulation. When CFP-ApCdc42G12V was expressed in sensory neurons, spontaneous but transient formation of new varicosities was observed in the absence of 5-HT (Figure 5E). The persistent expression of active ApCdc42 did not result in any further increase in varicosity number. We found that only 44% ± 18% of these varicosities were stable for 12 hr, versus 90% ± 4.1% in 5-HT controls. The expression level of Cdc42 was found to be relatively constant over the time points examined. These results suggest that the constitutively active ApCdc42 is able to induce the spontaneous formation of new sensory neuron varicosities but that the ApCdc42 signaling pathway alone is insufficient to stabilize this synaptic growth. This is consistent with our earlier studies, suggesting that learning-induced varicosity formation is independent of varicosity stabilization, which requires local protein synthesis (Casadio et al., 1999Casadio A. Martin K.C. Giustetto M. Zhu H. Chen M. Bartsch D. Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R.

The persistence of long-term memory: a molecular approach to self-sustaining changes in learning-induced synaptic growth.Neuron. 2004; 44: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To further characterize the role of filopodia in the 5-HT-induced formation of new varicosities, we expressed both CFP-synaptophysin and YFP-actin in sensory neurons and monitored the time course of presynaptic structural changes (Figure 5F). YFP-actin was present in most axonal processes but appeared to be concentrated at varicosities, whereas the CFP-synaptophysin was mostly excluded from processes and localized to both varicosities and growth cones. 5-HT induced the outgrowth of filopodia from preexisting varicosities, and some of these filopodia were subsequently transformed into new varicosities enriched in synaptophysin. Interestingly, the accumulation of synaptophysin was also found at the tips of some filopodia, which was most likely mediated by actin-myosin-based intracellular transport. Actin dynamics were most robust at growth cones, which normally express multiple filopodia. As was the case in varicosities, in growth cones some filopodia remained stable, and synaptophysin accumulated at their tips. These structural dynamics induced by 5-HT were blocked by the addition of ToxB (500 ng/ml) (Figure 5G). In the presence of ToxB, some varicosities lost their synaptophysin signal over time, whereas the varicosities themselves remained. When CytD was applied, the structural dynamics as well as the extension of filopodia induced by 5-HT were completely eliminated (Figure 5H). However, CytD did not fully depolymerize the actin networks, leaving a punctuated pattern of actin in both varicosities and axonal processes. The CytD-induced actin puncta did not align well with synaptophysin, suggesting that these puncta may represent a random aggregation of actin polymers. To study the spatial and temporal pattern of ApCdc42 activation during LTF, we monitored FRET in living sensory neurons expressing CFP-ApCdc42 and YFP-N-WASP-CRIB. We first confirmed FRET by photobleaching YFP to recover CFP fluorescence in sensory neurons expressi"

This was probably due to decreased cortical bone resorption, because osteoclasts were markedly reduced on the endosteal surface of cortical bone. In addition, the expression of alkaline phosphatase, an early osteoblastic differentiation marker, was normal, whereas the expression of the late osteoblast differentiation markers osteopontin and osteocalcin was reduced, suggesting that the number of mature osteoblasts in bone is reduced.

Yu S. Warner D.R. Liu J. Endocr.

Both PTH and PTH-related peptide (PTHrP), a paracrine regulator of chondrocyte differentiation in growth plates, activate a common receptor (PTH/PTHrP receptor, PPR), which activates Gsα as well as other G-proteins (2Kronenberg H.M.

Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 15: 229-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Different bones are formed by one of two different mechanisms, either intramembranous or endochondral ossification. Intramembranous ossification, which leads to formation of many of the flat bones, occurs when pluripotent mesenchymal cells directly enter an osteoblast lineage and differentiate into osteoblastic cells. Long bones develop by endochondral ossification in which a cartilage template is formed, and chondrocytes undergo hypertrophic differentiation and are then replaced by osteoblasts that form the primary spongiosa, which eventually forms the trabecular bone. Simultaneously, perichondrial cells surrounding the hypertrophic chondrocytes differentiate into osteoblasts to form the bone collar, which eventually becomes the cortical bone. It has been suggested that PTH may be important for regulation of fetal skeletal development (6Miao D. He B. Karaplis A.C. Goltzman D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). PTH null mice have defective formation of primary spongiosa and reduced trabecular bone and increased cortical bone thickness (6Miao D. He B. Karaplis A.C. Goltzman D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), whereas an activated PPR in osteoblasts produces opposite effects in trabecular and cortical bone (7Calvi L.M. Sims N.A.

Bone mass is tightly regulated by the balance between bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts (8Harada S. Rodan G.A. Nature. 2003; 15: 349-355Crossref Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) are expressed by osteoblasts and play an important role in the regulation of osteoclasts. RANKL activates osteoclasts by binding to the RANK receptor, whereas OPG is a secreted decoy receptor for RANK that binds RANKL and therefore inhibits osteoclast recruitment and activity. PTH has been shown to stimulate RANKL and inhibit OPG expression in osteoblasts, which promotes osteoclastic bone resorption (9Lee S. Lorenzo J.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3552-3561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene encoding Gsα (Gnas) is a complex-imprinted gene that generates multiple gene products through the use of alternative promoters and first exons (1Weinstein L.S. Yu S. Warner D.R. Liu J. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Mice with homozygous knockout of Gnas die during early embryonic development (10Yu S. Yu D. Lee E. Eckhaus M. Lee R.

A. 1998; 95: 8715-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), rendering this model useless for the study of the effects of Gsα deficiency on skeletal development or function. Therefore, we took advantage of the Cre-loxP system to generate osteoblast/osteocyte-specific Gsα knock-out mice (BGsKO mice) by mating Gsα-floxed mice with collagen Iα1 promoter-Cre recombinase transgenic mice (11Dacquin R. Starbuck M. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). BGsKO mice had reduced formation of primary spongiosa and reduced trabecular bone volume but had increased cortical bone thickness, primarily due to a decrease in RANKL expression and osteoclastic bone resorption. Gene expression studies suggest that the number of mature osteoblasts in bone is reduced. Overall, our findings suggest that osteoblast-specific Gsα deficiency leads to reduced bone turnover and that the differential effects of PTH on trabecular and cortical bone are mediated via Gsα signaling pathways in osteoblasts. Mice—The generation of collagen Iα1 promoter-Cre (Col1-Cre) transgenic mice was previously described (11Dacquin R. Starbuck M. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Cre expression patterns in Col1-Cre mice were assessed by mating with Rosa26-R reporter mice provided by P. Soriano. We have generated mice with loxP recombination sites surrounding Gsα exon 1 at positions -1601 and +419 relative to the Gsα translational start site (E1fl/fl ) (12Sakamoto A. Chen M. Kobayashi T.

Mice with osteoblast/osteocyte-specific Gsα deficiency (BGsKO; Col1-Cre+:E1fl/fl) were generated by repeated matings of Col1-Cre+ mice with E1fl/fl mice. Col1-Cre+ mice and Efl/fl mice were in FVB and Black Swiss genetic backgrounds, respectively. The Elfl allele has no effect on Gsα expression or phenotype (data not shown), and therefore, Col-Cre-:E1fl/+ littermates were used as controls. Mouse studies were approved by the NIDDK, National Institutes of Health Animal Care and Use Committee. Genotyping—The presence of wild type Gsα (E1+), E1fl, and recombined E1fl (E1-) alleles was determined in mouse tail DNA samples by multiplex PCR using the common upstream primer 5′-GAGAGCGAGAGGAAGACAGC-3′ (G1) and downstream primers 5′-TCGGGCCTCTGGCGGAGCTT-3′ (G2) and 5′-AGCCCTACTCTGTCGCAGTC-3′ (G3), respectively. The PCR mixture included 25% (v/v) betaine (Sigma). The presence or absence of the Col1-Cre transgene was determined by duplex PCR analysis with Cre-specific primers (5′-CCTGTTTTGCACGTTCACCG-3′ and 5′-ATGCTTCTGTCCGTTTGCCG-3′) and α-tubulin-specific primers (5′-AGACCATTGGGGGAGGAGAT-3′ and 5′-GTGGGTTCCAGGTCTACGAA-3′), which was included in each reaction as a positive control. PCR reactions were performed with the following cycling profile: 94 °C for 5 min followed by 32–35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s; 60 °C for 30 s; and 72 °C for 1 min; and a final cycle with 7 min of extension at 72 °C. Skeletal Staining—Skeletal preparation stained with Alcian blue and alizarin red staining was based on the method of McLeod (14McLeod M.J. Teratology. 1980; 22: 299-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Dissected skeletons were fixed in 90% ethanol for 1–2 days and stained with Alcian blue (0.015% Alcian blue 8GX (Sigma, 20% acetic acid, 75% ethanol) overnight at room temperature. Samples were then stained with alizarin red (0.005% alizarin sodium sulfate (Sigma), 1% potassium hydroxide). Samples were cleared with potassium hydroxide and stored in glycerol:ethanol (1:1). Histology—Dissected samples were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin using standard procedures, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Masson-Trichrome, or von Kossa stain. Tartrate-resistant Acid Phosphatase (TRAP) Staining—Deparaffinized sections were incubated at 37 °C in 0.1 m acetate buffer (pH 5) (Sigma) containing 220 μm naphthol AS-MX phosphate/dimethyl formaldehyde solution (Sigma), 2 mm fast red violet LB salt (Sigma), 50 mm l-(+)-sodium tartrate (Sigma), and 1 m MgCl2 for 30 min. Sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin. Immunoblotting—Flat skull bones, liver, and whole brain from newborn mice were homogenized in lysis buffer (T-PER; Pierce, Rockford, IL) on ice using a 200-μl microtissue grinder (Wheaton, Millville, NJ). For flat skull bones, as much surrounding soft tissue was removed as possible and bones were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein concentrations of whole tissue homogenates were determined using a dye assay (Bio-Rad). Homogenates (25 μg protein/lane) were separated in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitro-cellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were incubated with an anti-Gsα antibody (15Simonds W.F. Goldsmith P.K. Woodard C.J. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences), and bands were detected by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Membranes were then stripped as directed (Pierce) and reprobed with an anti-α-tubulin antibody (CP06; Calbiochem) and goat anti-mouse antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Reverse Transcription and Real-Time PCR Analysis—Flat skull bones were snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen, and total RNA was extracted (RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini kit, Qiagen) and then treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 15 min. Reverse transcription was performed using SuperScript III (SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR, Invitrogen). Gene expression levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR using a real-time PCR machine (MxP3000, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PCR reactions (25 μl of total volume) included cDNA, 100 nm primers, and 10 μl of SYBR Green MasterMix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To get relative quantification, standard curves were simultaneously generated with serial dilutions of cDNA and results were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA levels in each sample, which were determined simultaneously by the same method. Specificity of each RT-PCR product was indicated by its dissociation curve and the presence of a single band of expected size on acrylamide gel electrophoresis. 5–6 pairs of BGsKO mice and control littermates were used for each assay. The primers used for Gsα (16Liu J. Chen M. Deng C. Bourc'his D. Nealon J.G. Erlichman B. Bestor T.H. Weinstein L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. 2003; 18: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) have been previously published. GAPDH primers were obtained from Applied Biosystems. Generation of Mice with Osteoblast/Osteocyte-specific Gsα Deficiency—Col1-Cre transgenic mice were previously shown to specifically express the Cre recombinase transgene in osteoblasts and osteocytes (11Dacquin R. Starbuck M. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). To confirm the tissue expression patterns of the Col1-Cre transgene, Col1-Cre mice were mated with Rosa26-R reporter mice in which cre-mediated recombination leads to β-galactosidase expression (22Soriano P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4174) Google Scholar). Embryos at days E12.5, E15.5, and E17.5 were stained with X-gal to visualize the tissue distribution of Cre-recombinase activity. At E12.5, Cre expression was limited to the anterior craniofacial components (Fig. 1A). At days E15.5 and E17.5, Cre activity was also observed in osseous components of skull, ribs, and long bones. These results were similar to those previously described in similar experiments (11Dacquin R. Starbuck M. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We have generated E1fl/fl mice in which loxP recombination sites were inserted upstream and downstream of the Gsα promoter and first exon (12Sakamoto A. Chen M. Kobayashi T. Kronenberg H.M. Weinstein L.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cre-mediated recombination at these sites disrupts Gsα expression without disrupting the expression of other Gnas gene products, such as NESP55 and XLαs. These mice were repeatedly mated with Col1-Cre mice to generate Col1-Cre:E1fl/fl mice in which the Gsα gene is disrupted in osteoblasts and osteocytes (BGsKO mice). Genotyping was performed by PCR using a single upstream primer (G1) and two downstream primers (G2 and G3) in the same reaction (Fig. 1B). Amplification with primers G1 and G2 produces a 330-bp band for the normal Gsα (E1+) allele and a 390-bp band for the E1fl allele (Fig. 1, B and C). Because the tail samples include bone tissue, samples from BGsKO mice also produced a 250-bp band resulting from amplification of the recombined (E1-) allele by primers G1 and G3 (Fig. 1, B and C). The presence or absence of the Col1-Cre transgene in each mouse was also confirmed by duplex PCR using both Cre- and α-tubulin-specific primers (data not shown). Immunoblotting using a Gsα-specific antibody (15Simonds W.F. Goldsmith P.K. Woodard C.J. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) confirmed that Gsα protein levels were reduced in skull bones in newborn BGsKO compared with control littermates, whereas Gsα expression was relatively unaffected in liver and brain (Fig. 1E). Gsα mRNA levels were also decreased by 80% in skull bones (Fig. 4A). Given that these samples are also composed of other non-osteoblastic cells, this result indicates that the vast majority of osteoblasts in BGsKO mice are Gsα-deficient. All of the BGsKO newborn pups were unable to nurse and died within 6–8 h after birth. In addition, BGsKO mice were born with subcutaneous edema, a finding also observed in other models with germ line disruption of the maternal Gnas allele (10Yu S. Yu D. Lee E. Eckhaus M. Lee R. Corria Z. Accili D. Westphal H. Weinstein L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8715-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 23Skinner J.A. Cattanach B.M. Peters J. Genomics. 2002; 80: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). BGsKO mice had notable skeletal abnormalities, including small skulls with shortened craniofacial diameter and short limbs. In contrast, Col1-Cre+:E1fl/+ mice with heterozygous Gsα exon 1 deletion had no obvious phenotype (data not shown). Craniofacial Abnormalities in BGsKO Mice—Skeletal preparation of newborn BGsKO mice showed hypoplastic craniofacial bones, particularly in the anterior components, such as the maxilla and mandible and thickening of the zygomatic arch (Fig. 1, G–J). These craniofacial abnormalities correspond to the region of early Cre expression in Col1-Cre mice (Fig. 1A) and suggest an important role for Gsα signaling pathways in craniofacial development. Meckel's cartilage, a prominent feature of the developing mandible, was ossified in newborn BGsKO mice with the most severe craniofacial abnormalities (Fig. 1, H and I). Histology showed premature occurrence of endochondral ossification of the cartilage at E17.5 (data not shown). Based on the observed pattern of Cre expression (Fig. 1A) and the fact that chondrocytes of Meckel's cartilage may have a greater propensity to express collagen I than other chondrocytes (24Ishizeki K. Shinagawa T. Nawa T. Ann. Anat. 2003; 185: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), it is likely that the premature endochondral ossification is the result of Gsα deficiency in Meckel's cartilage chondrocytes. Premature ossification of Meckel's cartilage has also been observed in PTHrP knock-out mice (25Ishii-Suzuki M. Suda N. Yamazaki K. Kuroda T. Senior P.V. Beck F. Hammond V.E. Anat. Rec. 1999; 255: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cleft palate was present in 58% (33 of 57 mutants) of BGsKO mice (Fig. 1F) and was absent in all of the control littermates (data not shown). It is unclear whether cleft palate in BGsKO mice results from a primary defect in skeletal development or is a secondary effect resulting from a large protuberant tongue relative to the hypoplastic skeletal structures. Skeletal Development in BGsKO Mice—Skeletal preparations showed no obvious other changes in overall skeletal structure between BGsKO and control mice (Fig. 1G). There was a small but significant decrease in length of long bones in BGsKO mice (tibial length in BGsKO mice was 90.6% of that in control mice). Histological sections showed no obvious differences in the cartilaginous templates of femurs of BGsKO and control mice at E13.5 or E14.5 (Fig. 2, A–D). Von Kossa staining showed no calcification within the cartilaginous templates on day E13.5 in either BGsKO or control mice (data not shown). Calcification or bone collar induction of cartilaginous templates on day E14.5 was similar between BGsKO and control mice (Fig. 2, E and F), indicating that osteoblast-specific Gsα deficiency had no effect on the time of initiation of osteogenesis. Femurs of BGsKO mice on day E16.5 were shorter than control femurs with shortening of the metaphysis and diaphysis and relatively little change in the epiphysis. Although at this stage cortical bone formation is similar in BGsKO and control mice, the formation of primary spongiosa from endochondral ossification was markedly reduced in BGsKO mice compared with controls (Fig. 2, G–J). Shortening of the metaphysis and diaphysis of the femur in BGsKO mice was more obvious on day P0.5 (Fig. 3, A and B). At this stage, the zone of primary spongiosa formation was shorter in the distal femur of BGsKO mice than controls (Fig. 3, C and D). Moreover, Masson-Trichrome staining showed that the primary spongiosa of BGsKO mice was primarily composed of more mature and calcified matrix (dark blue), whereas in control mice, the primary spongiosa has a greater amount of immature osteoid, indicative of new bone formation (Fig. 3, E and F). These differences in endochondral ossification were limited to primary spongiosa formation, because the cartilaginous zones of the growth plate appeared normal in BGsKO mice. Overall, BGsKO mice appear to have reduced formation of primary spongiosa, which may lead to bone shortening due to reduced endochondral ossification. Long bones contain a collar of cortical bone, which is formed from perichondrium by membranous ossification. At day E16.5, there is no obvious difference in the amount of cortical bone in the femurs of BGsKO and control mice (Fig. 2, G–J). However, by day P0.5, BGsKO mice have a significantly increased thickness of cortical bone and narrowing of the bone marrow space within the diaphysis of the femur based upon both radiographic and histological analysis (Fig. 3, A, B, G, and H). Histology showed this region of bone to have increased thickness and connectivity in BGsKO mice (Fig. 3, G and H). TRAP staining, which is a marker for osteoclasts, was markedly reduced on the inner surface of cortical bone in BGsKO mice, indicating that Gsα deficiency in cortical osteoblasts and osteocytes reduces the recruitment of osteoclasts (Fig. 3, I and J). Reduced osteoclastic bone resorption is likely to be an important contributing factor to increased cortical bone thickness in BGsKO mice. In contrast, we did not observe an obvious difference in TRAP staining within the trabecular bone. Expression of Osteoblast Differentiation Markers and RANKL/OPG—We next examined the expression of osteoblastic differentiation markers and osteoblast-derived factors that affect osteoclast recruitment and activity by quantitative RT-PCR of skull bone samples. Although there was no difference in the expression of alkaline phosphatase, an early osteoblastic differentiation marker between BGsKO and control mice (Fig. 4B), the expression of other osteoblast markers, such as collagen I, osteopontin, and osteocalcin, was significantly decreased in BGsKO mice (Fig. 4, C–E), indicating that Gsα deficiency inhibits osteoblast maturation and bone forming ability. The differences were greatest for osteocalcin, a late marker of osteoblast differentiation. Osteoblasts secrete both RANKL and OPG, which stimulate and inhibit osteoclast resorption, respectively. Expression of both RANKL and OPG was significantly reduced in bone tissue of BGsKO mice (Fig. 4, F and G), which may be the result of poor osteoblastic maturation in these mice. Low RANKL may be one contributing factor to the low level of osteoclast recruitment observed in BGsKO mice. Overall, BGsKO mice appear to have reduced bone turnover with reduced osteoclast recruitment secondary to a primary defect in osteoblast maturation. Early embryonic lethality of germ line Gnas knock-out mice does not allow us to examine the effects of Gsα deficiency in skeletal development, which begins later in gestation. To circumvent this problem, we made use of the Cre-loxP recombination system and used a collagen Iα1-Cre transgenic mouse line to generate mice with Gsα deficiency in osteoblasts and osteocytes. In situ hybridization analysis confirmed that collagen Iα1 is expressed in both osteoblasts and osteocytes at similar levels in control and BGsKO (data not shown). BGsKO mice are born with subcutaneous edema and die soon after birth, features that have been observed in other germ line Gnas knock-out models (10Yu S. Yu D. Lee E. Eckhaus M. Lee R. Corria Z. Accili D. Westphal H. Weinstein L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8715-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 23Skinner J.A. Cattanach B.M. Peters J. Genomics. 2002; 80: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because there is no obvious explanation for how a skeletal defect could lead to subcutaneous edema, we suspect that this is due to Cre expression, leading to Gsα deficiency, in one or more non-skeletal tissues (e.g. placenta). We have no obvious explanation for the perinatal lethality, although one possibility is poor nutritional intake due to severe craniofacial malformation. Perinatal lethality is also observed in PTHrP and PPR knock-out mice (3Lanske B. Karaplis A.C. Lee K. Luz A. Vortkamp A. Pirro A. Karperien M. Defize L.H.K. Ho C. Mulligan R.C. Abou-Samra A.B. Juppner H. Segre G.V. Kronenberg H.M. Science. 1996; 273: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar, 4Karaplis A.C. Luz A. Glowacki J. Bronson R.T. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Kronenberg H.M. Mulligan R.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). This lethality allows us to only examine the effects of Gsα deficiency on bone development during gestational development. Long bones develop by endochondral ossification, a process by which mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondrocytes to form cartilaginous template. Chondrocytes at the center become hypertrophic followed by invasion of blood vessels, formation of a mineralized matrix, and osteoblastic replacement (primary spongiosa), which eventually becomes the central trabecular bone. This process proceeds in both directions, forming the growth plates that lead to bone elongation. Simultaneously, perichondrial cells surrounding the hypertrophic chondrocytes directly differentiate into osteoblasts to form the bone collar, which eventually becomes the cortical bone (2Kronenberg H.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). BGsKO mice have no apparent defect in the initial formation of the cartilage template or hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes, which is not surprising given that Gsα deficiency in this model is limited to cells of the osteoblastic, rather than chondrocytic lineage. This is also explains why BGsKO mice show no significant changes within the proliferative and hypertrophic zones of the epiphyseal growth plate at later stages. Chondrocyte-specific Gsα knock-out and other knock-out models suggest that regulation of the endochondral growth plates is mediated through PTHrP-PPR-Gsα pathways (3Lanske B. Karaplis A.C. Lee K. Luz A. Vortkamp A. Pirro A. Karperien M. Defize L.H.K. Ho C. Mulligan R.C. Abou-Samra A.B. Juppner H. Segre G.V. Kronenberg H.M.

A. 2004; 101: 14794-14799Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). BGsKO mice also did not show any changes in the gestational age at which bone collar formation began, suggesting that Gsα deficiency in osteoblasts does not affect the initiation of cortical bone formation. Consistent with this finding, the number of ossification centers in metacarpal bones (bone age) in newborn pups was the same between BGsKO and control mice (data not shown). In addition, the expression level of alkaline phosphatase, an early differentiation marker of osteoblasts, is similar in skull bones between BGsKO and control mice. Collagen Iα1 is an early differentiation marker of osteoblasts (27Quarles L.D. Yohay D.A. Lever L.W. Caton R. Wenstrup R.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 28Choi J.Y. Lee B.H. Song K.B. Park R.W. Kim I.S. Sohn K.Y. Jo J.S. Ryoo H.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 15: 609-618Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar), which is not expressed in osteoblastic precursors (bone marrow stromal or perichondrial cells; data not shown). This is likely to explain the lack of effect on the early stages of osteoblastic development and the relatively moderate skeletal phenotype in BGsKO mice compared with other relevant mouse models. Differences in skeletal development of long bones between BGsKO and control mice became most apparent on day E16.5 when it was clear that primary spongiosa in BGsKO mice had less immature bone matrix (osteoid) area, indicative of slower bone formation in this region, which resulted in less metaphyseal trabecular bone. Similar findings have been observed in PPR (29Lanske B. Amling M. Neff L. Guiducci J. Baron R. Kronenberg H.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and PTH (6Miao D. He B. Karaplis A.C. Goltzman D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) but not in PTHrP (29Lanske B. Amling M. Neff L. Guiducci J. Baron R. Kronenberg H.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) knock-out mice, suggesting that PTH is a major prenatal stimulator of bone formation within the primary spongiosa. PTH is also known to act as an anabolic agent for trabecular bone (30Nishida S. Yamaguchi A. Tanizawa T. Endo N. Mashiba T. Uchiyama Y. Suda T. Yoshiki S. Takahashi H.E. Bone (NY). 1994; 15: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and, for this reason, is presently used as a therapy for osteoporosis. Although we found no differences in the expression of alkaline phosphatase, an early osteoblastic differentiation marker, the expression of other differentiation markers (collagen I, osteopontin, and osteocalcin) was significantly reduced in bone of BGsKO mice. This may be due to lower rate of bone formation, reduced osteoblastic differentiation, or both. PTH and other cAMP stimulators have been shown to stimulate osteocalcin expression in cultured osteoblastic cells in some (31Noda M. Yoon K. Rodan G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18574-18577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not all (32Bellows C.G. Ishida H. Aubin J.E. Heersche J.N.M. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 3111-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 33Turksen K. Grigoriadis A.E. Heersche J.N.M. Aubin J.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) studies, whereas prostaglandin E2, another factor that stimulates Gsα pathways in bone, was shown to have little effect on osteocalcin expression (34Suda M. Tanaka K. Natsui K. Usui T. Tanaka I. Fukushima M. Shigeno C. Konishi J. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. Nakao N. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1698-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The present results, as well as results in other knock-out and cell culture models, suggest that PTH mediating its action through Gsα pathways in osteoblasts may be an important regulator of trabecular bone formation. In contrast to the effects on trabecular bone content, BGsKO mice had a significant increase in the thickness of cortical bone, leading to a reduced marrow space. PTH (6Miao D. He B. Karaplis A.C. Goltzman D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and PPR (29Lanske B. Amling M. Neff L. Guiducci J. Baron R. Kronenberg H.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) knock-out models also had reduced trabecular and increased cortical bone, whereas mice with osteoblast-specific expression of an activated PPR had the opposite effects on trabecular and cortical bone (7Calvi L.M. Sims N.A. Hunzelman J.L. Knight M.C. Giovannetti A. Saxton J.M. Kronenberg H.M. Baron R. Schipani E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Moreover, patients with primary hyperparathyroidism with excess circulating PTH levels tend to have a greater loss of cortical bone and relative sparing of trabecular bone (35Parisien M. Silverberg S.J. Shane E. de la Cruz L. Lindsay R. Bilezikian J.P. Dempster D.W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 70: 930-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The findings in this study, along with prior observations in both mouse and human, suggest that PTH through Gsα activation has effects on osteoblasts that lead to differential effects on cortical and trabecular bone volume (Fig. 5). Prior studies suggest that reduced osteoblast apoptosis due to loss of PTH action on osteoblasts may contribute to the observed increase in cortical bone (6Miao D. He B. Karaplis A.C. Goltzman D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 36Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Roberson P. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Although reduced osteoclast recruitment to cortical bone in BGsKO mice is probably a reflection of reduced osteoblast function in cortical bone, we have not ruled out the possibility that thickening of cortical bone in these mice is partially due to increased rates of cortical bone formation. A more likely contributor to the increased cortical thickness observed in BGsKO mice is reduced bone resorption by osteoclasts, because there was markedly reduced TRAP staining on the endosteal surface of cortical bone in BGsKO mice. TRAP staining in trabecular bone was relatively unaffected. Therefore, it is possible that the different effects we observed in cortical versus trabecular bone in BGsKO mice could be due to differential effects of Gsα deficiency in cortical versus trabecular osteoblasts on bone formation, osteoclast resorption, or both. Osteoclast recruitment and activation are stimulated by RANKL and other factors, such as interleukin 6, that are released from osteoblasts. PTH (9Lee S. Lorenzo J.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3552-3561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and prostaglandin E2 (37Kanematsu M. Sato T. Takai H. Watanabe K. Ikeda K. Yamada Y. J. Bone Miner.

Moreover, somatic Gsα mutations, which lead to constitutive activation in fibrous dysplasia of bone, result in osteoclast recruitment and invasion into cortical bone (40Weinstein L.S. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 1165-1176Google Scholar). It is unclear why we also observed OPG expression to be low in BGsKO mice, because PTH is known to reduce OPG expression (9Lee S. Lorenzo J.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3552-3561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This may indicate that PTH affects OPG expression through an alternative signaling pathway or reflect the fact that the osteoblast number or maturation is reduced in skull bones of BGsKO mice. It is also possible that this observed effect and possibly the differences observed in other osteoblastic markers are not due to osteoblast-autonomous effects but rather result from changes in the interaction of osteoblasts with matrix or other cellular components of bone. The low bone formation and osteoclast recruitment observed in BGsKO suggest that these mice overall have a low bone remodeling or turnover rate. PTH is one agent known to increase bone remodeling (5Rosen C.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 15: 229-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and therefore, osteoblast-specific Gsα deficiency would be predicted to result in a low turnover state. Because BGsKO mice only survive until birth, direct histomorphometric studies to directly assess bone turnover in this model is difficult. Further study in bone-specific knockouts using inducible or other more bone-specific transgenes will be required to examine this question. Overall, this initial study examining the effects of Gsα deficiency in osteoblastic cells shows that these pathways play an important role in bone formation and turnover by mediating the actions of PTH, prostaglandins, and other circulating factors on osteoblasts. Gsα may also have a more specific role in the development of the craniofacial skeleton. We thank Dr. Tatsuya Kobayashi for technical assistance and helpful comments."
https://openalex.org/W2022916625,"Cohesion established between sister chromatids during pre-meiotic DNA replication mediates two rounds of chromosome segregation. The first division is preceded by an extended prophase wherein homologous chromosomes undergo recombination. The persistence of cohesion during prophase is essential for recombination and both meiotic divisions. Here we show that Mnd2, a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) from budding yeast, is essential to prevent premature destruction of cohesion in meiosis. During S- and prophase, Mnd2 prevents activation of the APC/C by a meiosis-specific activator called Ama1. In cells lacking Mnd2 the APC/C-Ama1 enzyme triggers degradation of Pds1, which causes premature sister chromatid separation due to unrestrained separase activity. In vitro, Mnd2 inhibits ubiquitination of Pds1 by APC/C-Ama1 but not by other APC/C holo-enzymes. We conclude that chromosome segregation in meiosis depends on the selective inhibition of a meiosis-specific form of the APC/C."
https://openalex.org/W2015345074,"Lithium inhibits inositol monophosphatase at therapeutically effective concentrations, and it has been hypothesized that depletion of brain inositol levels is an important chemical alteration for lithium's therapeutic efficacy in bipolar disorder. We have employed adult rat cortical slices as a model to investigate the gene regulatory consequences of inositol depletion effected by lithium using cytidine diphosphoryl-diacylglycerol as a functionally relevant biochemical marker to define treatment conditions. Genes coding for the neuropeptide hormone pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) and the enzyme that processes PACAP's precursor to the mature form, peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, were upregulated by inositol depletion. Previous work has shown that PACAP can increase tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity and dopamine release, and we found that the gene for GTP cyclohydrolase, which effectively regulates TH through synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin, was also upregulated by inositol depletion. We propose that modulation of brain PACAP signaling might represent a new opportunity in the treatment of bipolar disorder."

In this study we examined the signaling pathways involved in the migration and tube formation on matrigel of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) induced by HARP. We report for the first time that receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase β/ζ (RPTPβ/ζ), which is a receptor for HARP in neuronal cell types, is also expressed in HUVEC.

HARP is highly conserved among species and shares 50% homology with midkine and the avian analogue of midkine retinoic-induced heparin-binding protein.

In the present work we examined the effect of HARP on the migration and tube formation on matrigel of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and investigated the signaling pathway induced by HARP during this process. We report that HARP induces migration of endothelial cells through binding to RPTPβ/ζ leading to activation of Src, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), PI3K, and Erk1/2. Cell culture reagents were from BiochromKG (Seromed, Germany). Expression of human recombinant HARP was induced in Escherichia coli BL21 pLys cells transformed with the human HARP-pETHH8 plasmid, as described previously (11Papadimitriou E. Heroult M. Courty J.

Antibodies against RPTPβ/ζ (sc-1110), Tyr(P) (PY20), FAK (sc-932), and HARP (sc-1394 and sc-1395) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Antibodies against non-phospho-Src (np-src) on Tyr527 and phospho-44/42 MAPK on Thr202-Tyr204 were purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti-MAPK1/2 (number 06-182), anti-Src (GD11, number 05-184), and anti-PI3K p85 (number 06-497) antibodies were from Upstate. Anti-β-actin (MAB1501) was purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. All secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies, chondroitin sulfate-C (CS-C), sodium orthovanadate and protein A-agarose (P-1406) were purchased from Sigma. PP1, wortmannin, LY294002, and U0126 were purchased from TOCRIS. All other reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture—HUVEC were isolated from human umbilical cords, cultured as described previously (11Papadimitriou E. Heroult M. Courty J. Polykratis A. Stergiou C. Katsoris P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and used at passages 1–2. The cells were grown as monolayers in medium M199 supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 150 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, 5 units/ml heparin sodium, 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity. When HUVEC reached 80–90% confluence, they were serum-starved for 18 h before performing any further experiments. Migration Assay—Migration assays were performed as described previously (12Papadimitriou E. Polykratis A. Courty J. Koolwijk P. Heroult M. Katsoris P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) in 24-well microchemotaxis chambers (Costar, Avon, France) using uncoated polycarbonate membranes with 8-μm pores. Serum-starved HUVEC were harvested and resuspended at a concentration of 105 cells/0.1 ml in M199 containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The bottom chamber was filled with 0.6 ml of M199 containing 0.25% BSA and the tested substances. The upper chamber was loaded with 105 cells and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. After completion of the incubation, the filters were fixed and stained with 0.33% toluidine blue solution. The cells that migrated through the filter were quantified by counting the entire area of each filter, using a grid and an Optech microscope at a 20× magnification. Matrigel Tube Formation Assay—The matrigel tube formation assay was performed as described previously (12Papadimitriou E. Polykratis A. Courty J. Koolwijk P. Heroult M. Katsoris P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, Matrigel that was growth factor-reduced was used to coat the wells of 96-well tissue culture plates (0.04 ml/well) and was left to polymerize for 1 h at 37 °C. After polymerization, 15,000 cells suspended in 0.15 ml of M199 were added to each well. HARP was added directly in the medium. After 6 h of incubation at 37 °C, the medium was removed, the cells were fixed and stained, and the length of the tube network was measured in the total area of the wells, as described previously (12Papadimitriou E. Polykratis A. Courty J. Koolwijk P. Heroult M. Katsoris P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). RNA Interference—RNA oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Ambion, Inc. The following sequences were used as described previously (20Muller S. Kunkel P. Lamszus K. Ulbricht U. Lorente G.A. Nelson A.M. von Schack D. Chin D.J. Lohr S.C. Westphal M. Melcher T. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6661-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar): RPTPβ/ζ sense, 5′-AAAUGCGAAUCCUAAAGCGUU-3′; RPTPβ/ζ antisense, 5′-AACGCUUUAGGAUUCGCAUUU-3′. The annealing of the primers was achieved according to Ambion's instructions. Cells were passaged and grown to a confluence of 40% in medium without antibiotics. The transfection of cells was performed in serum-free medium for 4 h using annealed RNA at the concentration of 50 mm and jetSI-ENDO (Polyplus-Transfection, France) as transfection reagent. Cells were incubated for another 24 h in serum-containing medium and serum-starved before further experiments. The transfection efficiency was evaluated using Silencer β-actin siRNA control (Ambion). Double-stranded negative control siRNA from Ambion was also used in migration and differentiation assays. Immunoprecipitation Assay—Cells were grown to confluence in 145-mm dishes. The medium was aspirated, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 2 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 20 nm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA). Cells were scraped off the plate and transferred to Eppendorf tubes. Cell lysates were kept on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Approximately 400 μg of the supernatant were transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and incubated with 30 μl of prepared suspension of protein A-agarose beads for 60 min at room temperature. Beads were collected by centrifugation, and the supernatants were transferred to new Eppendorf tubes. After this first pre-cleaning step, supernatants were further incubated with 500 ng of primary antibody for 60 min at room temperature. At the end of this period, 80 μl of prepared suspension of protein A-agarose beads were added, and samples were incubated for 18 h at 4 °C. Protein A beads and bound proteins were collected by centrifugation (1,000 × g, 4 °C) and washed three times with ice-cold cell lysis buffer. The pellet was resuspended with 60 μlof2× SDS loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m dithiothreitol) and kept at 4 °C until use. When ready for electrophoresis, samples were heated to 95–100 °C for 5 min and centrifuged, and 50 μl of the supernatant were analyzed by Western blotting. Western Blot—Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P membranes. Blocking was performed by incubating the membranes with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.4, containing 3% BSA (in the case of HARP, RPTPβ/ζ and phosphotyrosine) or TBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk (in all other cases) for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were further incubated in primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature or for 18 h at 4 °C under continuous agitation, as follows: PY20 at 1:5,000 dilution in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 1% BSA, anti-FAK antibody at 1:600 dilution in TBS-T containing 3% nonfat dry milk, anti-RPTPβ/ζ antibody at 1:1,000 dilution in TBS-T containing 1% BSA, anti-HARP antibody at 1:5,000 dilution in TBS-T containing 1% BSA, anti-np-src antibody at 1:1,000 dilution in TBS-T containing 5% BSA, anti-Src antibody at 1:5,000 dilution in TBS-T containing 3% nonfat dry milk, anti-phosphoErk1/2 antibody at 1:1,000 dilution in TBS-T containing 5% BSA, anti-Erk1/2 antibody at 1:5,000 dilution in TBS-T containing 3% nonfat dry milk, anti-PI3K p85 antibody at 1: 1,000 dilution in TBS-T containing 3% nonfat dry milk, and anti-β-actin antibody at 1:5,000 dilution in TBS-T containing 3% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were further washed three times in TBS-T and incubated in secondary antibodies (1:12,500 dilution in TBS-T for anti-rabbit and anti-goat antibodies and 1:7,500 dilution in TBS-T containing 3% nonfat dry milk for anti-mouse antibody) for 1 h at room temperature under continuous agitation. Membranes were washed three times with TBS-T and twice with TBS. Detection of immunoreactive bands was performed using the ChemiLucent detection kit (Chemicon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blots for np-src, pFAK, and pErk1/2 were stripped and subjected to subsequent Western blotting for c-Src, FAK, and Erk1/2, respectively. The protein levels that corresponded to the immunoreactive bands were quantified using the ImagePC image analysis software (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD). Total RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase-PCRs—Total HUVEC RNA was isolated using Nucleospin® RNA II (Macherey-Nagel) according to manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcriptase-PCRs were performed using the Access Reverse Transcriptase-PCR system (Promega). The sequences of the primers used for RPTPβ/ζ were 5′-GGCGTAAGAGATCATATAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCTCCAGACTAATTACACC-3′ (antisense) and for β-actin were 5′-GCACACTTAGCCGTGTTCTTTGCACTTTCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGGCGTACAGGGATAGCACAGCCTGGATAG-3′ (antisense). Statistical Analysis—The significance of variability between the results from each group and the corresponding control was determined by unpaired t test. Each experiment included triplicate wells for each condition tested, and all results are expressed as mean ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. HARP Stimulates Migration and Differentiation of Serumstarved HUVEC—HARP is known to affect the migration and differentiation of different types of endothelial cells (12Papadimitriou E. Polykratis A. Courty J. Koolwijk P. Heroult M. Katsoris P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the present work, we studied the effect of HARP on serum-starved HUVEC. As shown in Fig. 1, human recombinant HARP induced migration of HUVEC in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximum increase was ∼40% over the control at the concentration of 100 ng/ml of HARP and was inhibited by sodium orthovanadate and CS-C (Fig. 1), indicating that RPTPβ/ζ may be the phosphatase involved in this process. The significant decrease in the migration of unstimulated HUVEC by sodium orthovanadate could be because of inhibition of phosphatases other than RPTPβ/ζ, which may influence base-line migration independent of HARP stimulation. HARP also induced tube-like formation by HUVEC on matrigel, and this effect was abolished when cells were treated with sodium orthovanadate or CS-C (Fig. 1). In contrast to its effect on HUVEC migration, sodium orthovanadate had no effect on the tube formation of unstimulated cells on matrigel. Matrigel contains several growth factors and other undefined components involved in cell proliferation or/and differentiation that may affect the action of sodium orthovanadate, leading to a different response of the same cells cultivated under different conditions. RPTPβ/ζ Is Present in HUVEC and Associates with HARP— To investigate whether RPTPβ/ζ is found in HUVEC and acts as a receptor for HARP, we cultured cells in 145-mm plates to confluence. Cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and 400 μg of total protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation against HARP or RPTPβ/ζ. As shown in Fig. 2, RPTPβ/ζ was detected in all immunoprecipitates as one band of molecular mass ∼200 kDa, which corresponds to a transmembrane spliced variant of RPTPβ/ζ (20Muller S. Kunkel P. Lamszus K. Ulbricht U. Lorente G.A. Nelson A.M. von Schack D. Chin D.J. Lohr S.C. Westphal M. Melcher T. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6661-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 21Sakurai T.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2603-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). These data suggest that RPTPβ/ζ in HUVEC interacts with HARP. c-Src Kinase Lies Downstream of RPTPβ/ζ and Links the Receptor with FAK—We investigated whether c-Src kinase is involved in the signaling pathway triggered by the interaction of HARP with RPTPβ/ζ in HUVEC. We used cell lysates from confluent HUVEC and performed immunoprecipitation for RPTPβ/ζ. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted against c-Src kinase and RPTPβ/ζ. c-Src was detected in RPTPβ/ζ immunoprecipitates, indicating that RPTPβ/ζ can interact with c-Src in presence or absence of HARP. Moreover, it seems that the interaction of c-Src with RPTPβ/ζ is increased in the presence of HARP (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). Because c-Src is known to bind and further activate FAK (23Maa M.C. Leu T.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 51: 344-349Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we tested whether c-Src binds FAK in HUVEC. In HUVEC lysates we performed immunoprecipitation against FAK and Western blot against c-Src kinase, np-src, and FAK. As shown in Fig. 3 (lanes 3 and 4), c-Src was detected as a band of 60 kDa, indicating the existence of a c-Src-FAK complex, which was increased in the presence of HARP. Moreover, the amounts of np-src interacting with FAK were increased in the presence of HARP (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, FAK or RPTPβ/ζ was not detected in RPTPβ/ζ or FAK immunoprecipitates, respectively (data not shown). Taken together, the above data indicate that c-Src is an intermediate molecule in the transduction of HARP signaling to FAK. HARP Induces the Association of FAK with PI3K—We also investigated whether PI3K is involved in the HARP signaling pathway in endothelial cells. We used cell lysates from confluent HUVEC and performed immunoprecipitation for RPTPβ/ζ, c-Src kinase, and FAK. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted against PI3K. PI3K was detected only in FAK immunoprecipitates, verifying a direct association of the two molecules (Fig. 4). In the same figure, it is evident that the association between FAK and PI3K is more intense after treatment of cells with HARP (lanes 6 and 7), which was verified by immunoblotting the same membrane against FAK. HARP Induces Activation of c-Src Kinase by C-terminal Dephosphorylation—The formation of a c-Src-FAK complex is essential for full phosphorylation and activation of FAK (24Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Fry D.W. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4806-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 25Ruest P.J. Roy S. Shi E. Mernaugh R.L. Hanks S.K. Cell Growth & Differ. 2000; 11: 41-48PubMed Google Scholar). Because full c-Src kinase activation and binding to FAK requires dephosphorylation of Tyr527, we examined whether HARP can affect the phosphorylation status of c-Src kinase at this site. We incubated serum-starved HUVEC with 100 ng/ml of HARP for different time periods and evaluated c-Src dephosphorylation by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. HARP increased c-Src dephosphorylation at Tyr527, leading to its activation. Activation of c-Src was observed after 5 min and in most of the cases was maintained up to 30 min after the addition of HARP. Activation of c-Src by HARP was inhibited by both sodium orthovanadate and CS-C (Fig. 5). HARP Induces FAK Phosphorylation through Activation of c-Src—Because c-Src was found to interact with FAK, we further investigated whether c-Src activation could be implicated to increased phosphorylation of FAK. Incubation of HUVEC with 100 ng/ml of HARP led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK 15 min after the addition of HARP in the medium of HUVEC. The activation remained at maximal levels up to 30 min after HARP application and was inhibited by sodium orthovanadate and CS-C or the c-Src inhibitor PP1 (Fig. 6). HARP Induces Phosphorylation and Activation of Erk1/2 through PI3K—We further tested the effect of HARP on the activation of Erk1/2. HARP induced the activation of both Erk1 and Erk2 within 5 min after the addition of HARP in the medium of HUVEC, with the maximum effect observed after 15 min. HARP-induced Erk1/2 activation was inhibited by sodium orthovanadate and CS-C and PP1, suggesting that RPTPβ/ζ and c-Src may be involved in this process. It was also inhibited by two PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, suggesting that PI3K is involved and lies upstream of Erk1/2 in this signaling pathway of HARP. Finally, the well known inhibitor of MEK U01261 also inhibited HARP-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 7). HARP-induced HUVEC Migration and Tube-like Formation Was Inhibited by Pharmacological Inhibition of c-Src, PI3K, and MEK—PP1, wortmannin, LY294002, and U0126 completely inhibited HARP-induced HUVEC migration, implying the involvement of c-Src, PI3K, and MAPK in the chemotactic activity of HARP. Furthermore, treatment of HUVEC with the same inhibitors inhibited HARP-induced tube formation on matrigel (Fig. 8). RPTPβ/ζ Knockdown by RNA Interference Interrupts HARP Signaling and HARP-induced Migration and Differentiation of HUVEC—To further establish that RPTPβ/ζ is the receptor of HARP in HUVEC and that the biological activity of HARP is mediated by binding to RPTPβ/ζ, we performed the same set of experiments in HUVEC after down-regulation of RPTPβ/ζ by RNA interference (20Muller S. Kunkel P. Lamszus K. Ulbricht U. Lorente G.A. Nelson A.M. von Schack D. Chin D.J. Lohr S.C. Westphal M. Melcher T. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6661-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 9, 48 h following transfection, a significant reduction of both mRNA and the protein levels of RPTPβ/ζ was achieved in HUVEC, which led to a significant reduction of HARP-induced c-Src activation, as well as FAK and Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 10).Fig. 10RPTPβ/ζ knockdown in HUVEC inhibited HARP-induced signaling.Numbers denote the average -fold change of the ratios np-src:src, pFAK:FAK, and pErk1/2:Erk1/2, compared with unstimulated cells (set as default = 1) of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Finally, we examined whether RPTPβ/ζ knockdown inhibits HARP-induced HUVEC migration and differentiation. As shown in Fig. 11, the biological effect of HARP was abolished when RPTPβ/ζ expression was down-regulated. It is noteworthy that RPTPβ/ζ knockdown results in the reduction of unstimulated cell tube formation, which is in contrast to the lack of effect of sodium orthovanadate on unstimulated cells (Fig. 1). Methodological differences or the nonspecific actions of sodium orthovanadate could be responsible for this discrepancy. HARP is an 18-kDa heparin-binding growth factor that is implicated in cell growth and differentiation and has a potent role in angiogenesis and tumor growth (1Papadimitriou E. Polykratis A. Hatziapostolou M. Parthymou A. Polytarchou C. Mikelis C. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the present work, we studied the signaling pathway that is activated by HARP in HUVEC and leads to increased cell migration. Our data suggest that RPTPβ/ζ expressed by HUVEC is involved in HARP-induced HUVEC migration and tube formation on matrigel. This is supported by the co-immunoprecipitation of the two molecules, as well as the inhibition of HARP activity by sodium orthovanadate or CS-C. These results are in line with previous reports that linked RPTPβ/ζ to cell migration induced by HARP and midkine in neuronal cells (18Qi M. Ikematsu S. Maeda N. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Sakuma S. Noda M.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), where RPTPβ/ζ is considered to be a HARP receptor (19Kinnunen A. Kinnunen T. Kaksonen M. Nolo R. Panula P. Rauvala H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 635-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Meng K. Rondriguez-Pena A. Dimitrov T. Chen W. Yamin M. Noda M. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2603-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). This is the first time however that RPTPβ/ζ is reported to be a HARP receptor in non-neuronal cells and to be expressed by human endothelial cells. It is also the first time that a signaling pathway of RPTPβ/ζ is being characterized. c-Src kinase is co-immunoprecipitated with RPTPβ/ζ in HUVEC lysates. This is the first time that a direct association of these two molecules is shown, although a potential role of c-Src kinase as a downstream molecule of RPTPβ/ζ signaling has been previously implied as a potential event in the signal cascade induced by midkine (18Qi M. Ikematsu S. Maeda N. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Sakuma S. Noda M. Muramatsu T. Kadomatsu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15868-15875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Activation of c-Src was inhibited by sodium orthovanadate or CS-C but not by genistein (data not shown), which suggests that binding of HARP to RPTPβ/ζ leads to the induction of phosphatase activity and dephosphorylation of c-Src kinase at Tyr527 (Fig. 5B), which leads to its activation (27Schlaepfer D.D. Mitra S.K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The inhibition of HARP signaling by sodium orthovanadate has been reported previously (16Souttou B. Ahmad S. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19588-19593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Souttou B. Raulais D. Vigny M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), indicating a role of phosphatases in this process without, however, clarifying the phosphatase(s) involved. The lack of effect of sodium orthovanadate on the ratio of activated to inactive c-Src in unstimulated cells presented in Fig. 5 is consistent with its inhibition of phosphatases other than RPTPβ/ζ, which may contribute to normal basal migration of HUVEC. It is well known that HARP binding to RPTPβ/ζ is mediated by both the protein core and the chondroitin sulfate chains of the receptor, and this interaction is inhibited by exogenously supplied chondroitin sulfates (26Maeda N. Noda M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The fact that in the present study HARP binding to RPTPβ/ζ was inhibited by free CS-C chains further supports the notion that RPTPβ/ζ is the receptor involved in activation of c-Src kinase and the subsequent signaling pathway that finally leads to increased cell migration. It has been suggested in neuronal cells that binding of HARP to RPTPβ/ζ leads to receptor dimerization, resulting in the inactivation of the phosphatase activity and increased phosphorylation of β-catenin (22Meng K. Rondriguez-Pena A. Dimitrov T. Chen W. Yamin M. Noda M. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2603-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). However, neither dimerization of RPTPβ/ζ nor inactivation of phosphatase activity has directly been shown. Moreover, increased phosphorylation of β-catenin can also be the result of c-Src activation (28Lin M.T. Yen M.L. Lin C.Y. Kuo M.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), which seems to be the case based on our data (see above). c-Src has also been shown to be a substrate of another receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase, RPTPα. An interaction of the SH2 domain of Src with the C-terminal Tyr789 of RPTPα results in dephosphorylation of the inhibitory phosphorylation site of c-Src (Tyr527), leading to c-Src activation (29Zheng X.M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A similar interaction with the SH2 domain of Src has been shown for RPTPϵ (30Katchalski H.T. Elson A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5024-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which suggests that it may be a common mechanism for many, if not all, receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatases. c-Src was also found to co-immunoprecipitate with FAK, in accordance with several reports describing a FAK-Src complex (27Schlaepfer D.D. Mitra S.K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Because FAK was not detected in RPTPβ/ζ immunoprecipitates of HUVEC lysates (data not shown) we assume that c-Src kinase links FAK to RPTPβ/ζ and HARP signaling. The SH2 domain of c-Src kinase is known to recognize and bind phosphorylated Tyr397 of FAK (31Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar), leading to elevated FAK phosphorylation (27Schlaepfer D.D. Mitra S.K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). This seems to be the case in our experiments too, because HARP-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was inhibited by CS-C, sodium orthovanadate, and PP1. FAK interaction with c-Src results to enhanced phosphorylation of FAK and creates docking sites for several other molecules, such as PI3K and Shc (27Schlaepfer D.D. Mitra S.K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Several reports have implicated the PI3K-MAPK pathway in HARP signaling (16Souttou B. Ahmad S. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19588-19593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Souttou B. Raulais D. Vigny M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), however, without any data on the upstream signaling molecules involved. In the present work we indicate for the first time that activation of c-Src after the binding of HARP to RPTPβ/ζ can lead to activation of FAK and subsequently of the PI3K and MAPK signaling pathway, which finally leads to HARP-induced HUVEC migration and differentiation. Interestingly, no Akt activation was observed after treatment of HUVEC with HARP (data not shown), although PI3K was found to be involved in HUVEC signaling. Akt activation was observed in HUVEC after stimulation with midkine (32Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Powers C. Bowden E.T. Sale E.B. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35990-35998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) suggesting that there are distinct pathways of HARP and midkine in these cells. Alternatively, Akt activation may not be possible to detect in our experiments because of increased basal levels (data not shown), possibly as a result of serum starvation of HUVEC. The role of RPTPβ/ζ in signaling triggered by HARP in HUVEC is supported further by our results obtained after RPTPβ/ζ knockdown by RNA interference. Our results clearly demonstrate that RPTPβ/ζ down-regulation interrupts HARP signaling (Fig. 10) in HUVEC and abolishes its biological activity on cell migration and differentiation (Fig. 11). We also saw a decrease in unstimulated HUVEC migration and differentiation in these RPTPβ/ζ knockdown studies. This effect would be consistent with interference of endogenously expressed HARP-mediated processes in these cells (1Papadimitriou E. Polykratis A. Hatziapostolou M. Parthymou A. Polytarchou C. Mikelis C. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Moreover, RPTPβ/ζ binds various cell adhesion and extracellular matrix molecules (33Grumet M.

At least in the development of the nervous system, although phosphatase activity is required for many RPTP-mediated developmental events, some developmental functions of RPTPs do not require tyrosine phosphatase activity (37Ensslen-Craig S.E. Brady-Kalnay S.M. Dev. Biol. 2004; 275: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Finally, it is becoming increasingly recognized that receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatases are implicated in the regulation of integrin-mediated events (38Petrone A. Sap J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2345-2354PubMed Google Scholar), which seem to play significant role in HUVEC migration and tube formation on matrigel (39Kronenwett R. Graf T. Nedbal W. Weber M. Steidl U. Rohr U.P. Mohler T. Haas R. Cancer Gene Ther. 2002; 9: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). RPTPα-dependent differences in cell spreading on fibronectin and vitronectin substrates are mediated by the ανβ3 integrin, and although RPTPα does not modulate integrin-ligand interactions, it seems to regulate the strength of integrin-cytoskeleton bonds (40von Wichert G. Jiang G. Kostic A. De Vos K. Sap J. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Integrin α3β1 uses a complex involving protein kinase CβII, RACK1, and PTPμ to regulate cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, possibly by modulating tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin (41Chattopadhyay N. Wang Z. Ashman L.K. Brady-Kalnay S.M. Kreidberg J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). RPTPβ/ζ seems to participate in a multimolecular complex involving the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 ectodomain, α6β1-integrin, and α4β1-integrin (42Muramatsu H. Zou P. Suzuki H. Oda Y. Chen G.Y. Sakaguchi N. Sakuma S. Maeda N. Noda M. Takada Y. Muramatsu T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5405-5415Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Whether such a complex is formed in HUVEC and what its possible role might be is not known and is under further investigation. Taken together, our results implicate RPTPβ/ζ in HARP-induced migration and differentiation of human endothelial cells and identify the signaling molecules involved.

Toll is activated by high affinity binding of the cytokine Spätzle, a dimeric ligand of the cystine knot family. In vertebrates, a related family of Toll-like receptors play a critical role in innate immune responses. Despite the importance of this family of receptors, little is known about the biochemical events that lead to receptor activation and signaling. Here, we show that Spätzle binds to the N-terminal region of Toll and, using biophysical methods, that the binding is complex. The two binding events that cause formation of the cross-linked complex are non-equivalent: the first Toll ectodomain binds Spätzle with an affinity 3-fold higher than the second molecule suggesting that pathway activation involves negative cooperativity. We further show that the Toll ectodomains are able to form low affinity dimers in solution and that juxtamembrane sequences of Toll are critical for the activation or derepression of the pathway.

Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 280Issue 24PreviewIn Drosophila, the Toll receptor mediates cellular signal transduction pathways involved in both innate immune responses and in establishing embryonic dorso-ventral patterning. In order to become active, the Toll receptor must both dimerize and bind to its dimeric ligand, Spätzle. However, the exact sequence of the events leading to this activation and their biochemical nature is unknown. Full-Text PDF Open Access The Toll family of type I transmembrane receptors mediate cellular signal transduction pathways that are central to innate immune responses in both vertebrates and invertebrates (1Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6190) Google Scholar). These receptors are responsible for detecting microbial molecular patterns, for example bacterial lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharides, and activating a cellular defense response. The overall structure of Toll receptors is evolutionarily conserved, with characteristic ectodomains consisting mainly of sequences of leucine rich repeats (LRRs) 1The abbreviations used are: LRR, leucine-rich repeat; TLR, Toll-like receptor; IL, interleukin; TIR, Toll/IL-1 receptor domain; C106, dimer of C-terminal 106 amino acids of Spätzle; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; NGF, nerve growth factor; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; HEK, human embryonic kidney; Sulfo-GMBS, N-(γ-maleimidobutylody)sulfosuccinimide ester; Sulfo-KMUS (N-(κ-maleimidoundecanoyloxy)sulfosuccinimide ester; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; c(S), concentration as a function of sedimentation coefficient; c(M), concentration as a function of molecular mass. flanked by cysteine rich capping structures and an intracellular TIR (Toll/IL-1R) domain (2Rock F.L.

Despite this structural conservation, different mechanisms have arisen for the detection of pathogen patterns in invertebrates and vertebrates (3Gangloff M. Gay N.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 294-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In insects, for example, peptidoglycan is bound by a specific recognition protein and this complex then stimulates a cascade of serine proteases the terminal member of which processes an inactive proprotein form of the cytokine Spätzle to form an active protein ligand (4DeLotto Y. DeLotto R. Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 5Weber A. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J. Lelièvre E. Gascan H. Ray K. Morse M. Imler J. Gay N. Nat.

Immunol. 2004; 5: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). By contrast, in mammals Toll-like receptors are thought to directly interact with microbial compounds (7Re F. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23427-23432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 8Miyake K. Trends Microbiol. 2004; 12: 186-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Despite these differences, Toll receptors probably require ligand-induced dimerization or cross-linking to establish intracellular signal transduction, a feature shared with other type I transmembrane receptors (9Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 459-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Such a mode of action was recently illustrated for the founding member of the family, Drosophila Toll (5Weber A. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J. Lelièvre E. Gascan H. Ray K. Morse M. Imler J. Gay N. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the Toll receptor is involved in dorso-ventral patterning of the embryo as well as innate immune responses (10Belvin M.P. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 11Imler J.L. Hoffmann J.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 304-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). For example, female flies carrying loss-of-function mutations in Toll lay eggs that develop into embryos in which all cells adopt dorsal fates. In addition, these flies fail to express antimicrobial peptides in response to infection by Gram-positive bacteria and fungi and poorly resist these infections. Both processes require the same post-receptor components and the activating Spätzle ligand. However, differently regulated protease cascades are responsible for ligand generation in embryonic development and innate immune responses in adult flies (12Ligoxygakis P. Pelte N. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Science. 2002; 297: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In the 1990s, genetic studies identified two classes of Toll gain-of-function alleles that cause a dominant ventralization of the embryo (13Schneider D.S. Hudson K.L. Lin T.Y. Anderson K.V. Gene Dev. 1991; 5: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The first class (type I mutants) are point mutations in the extracellular domain of Toll involving specific cysteine residues in the juxtamembrane, cysteine-rich flank of the second block of LRRs. These cysteine residues are thought to be involved in disulfide bonds and disruption of these is believed to cause constitutive activation of the receptor. The second class of mutations (type II mutants) produces truncated ectodomains that are secreted from the embryo. The available evidence suggests that these mutations act by binding and then redistributing active Spätzle ligand in the perivitelline space of the embryo, causing inappropriate activation of receptors located at lateral and dorsal positions. The basic principle that signal transduction by Type 1 transmembrane receptors requires dimerization is long established (9Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 459-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). This has led to an expectation that active signaling complexes should be structurally symmetrical and that the sites of ligand interaction would be essentially equivalent. However, more recent structural and biophysical studies suggest that the events leading to ligand binding are complex and that some signaling assemblies are in fact asymmetrical. For example, cross-linking of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor requires binding of two monomeric EGF molecules. After formation of ligand-receptor complexes, subsequent receptor dimerization may involve either second separate sites on ligand and receptor or a conformational rearrangement in the receptor allowing self-association (14Lemmon M.A. Bu Z. Ladbury J.E. Zhou M. Pinchasi D. Lax I. Engelman D.M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The latter view has gained considerable support from structural analysis of EGF-receptor complexes (15Schlessinger J. Cell. 2002; 110: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 16Ogiso H. Ishitani R. Nureki O. Fukai S. Yamanaka M. Kim J.H. Saito K. Sakamoto A. Inoue M. Shirouzu M.

In another example, structures of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor in complex with FGF show that a molecule of heparin links together two heterodimers of FGF and FGF-R into a highly asymmetrical pentameric complex (18Harmer N.J.

Unlike the EGF and FGF pathways Drosophila Toll is activated by a dimeric ligand. The structure adopted by the active C-terminal fragment of Spätzle (C106) is a cystine knot, a fold held in common with neurotrophins such as NGF, and two monomers are held together as a covalent dimer by a single intermolecule disulfide bond (4DeLotto Y. DeLotto R. Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19Mizuguchi K. Parker J.S. Blundell T.L. Gay N.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 239-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Both in vivo and in vitro, C106 can form a heterotrimer with two molecules of the Toll receptor ectodomains (5Weber A. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J. Lelièvre E. Gascan H. Ray K. Morse M. Imler J. Gay N. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Thus in contrast to EGF, Spätzle binding alone should be sufficient to cause receptor cross-linking. In this paper we report that Toll pathway activation probably requires receptor-receptor interactions as well as ligand induced cross-linking. Protein Production and Purification—Recombinant His-tagged Toll, Toll5B, and C106 proteins were produced in the baculovirus system and purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography as described in detail in (5Weber A. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J. Lelièvre E. Gascan H. Ray K. Morse M. Imler J. Gay N. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In brief, constructs for Toll (residues 1–801), Toll5B (1–668), and full-length Spätzle proprotein were subcloned into pFastBac and sequenced and recombinant baculoviruses generated using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). Viruses were amplified by infection of Sf9 suspension cultures with 2% fetal bovine serum, and protein expression in the supernatant was confirmed by immunoblot using anti-penta-His-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Qiagen). For protein expression, 10-liter suspension cultures of Sf9 cells were infected at multiplicity of infection of 10.0 (TollWT), 5.0 (Toll5B), or 1.0 (Spätzle) and the supernatant harvested 48 h post-infection. After centrifugation, protein-containing supernatants were concentrated on a Centramate tangential flow system (Pall Filtron) with buffer exchange to binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). After addition of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), His-tagged proteins were purified on Qiagen Superflow NiNTA agarose and gel filtration on Superdex 75 or 200 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Spätzle C106 was generated from purified proprotein using tryptic proteolysis as described (5Weber A. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J. Lelièvre E. Gascan H. Ray K. Morse M. Imler J. Gay N. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—For isothermal titration calorimetry experiments, a Microcal VP-ITC microcalorimeter was used. Measurements were carried out at 25 °C by injecting Toll or Toll5B at concentrations of 148 or 105 μm, respectively, into the measuring cell containing C106 fragment at concentration of 4.98 μm (dimer concentration). In the reverse setup, C106 at a concentration of 45.5 μm was injected into Toll or Toll5B at 5.16 or 4.19 μm, respectively. Injections were performed every 3 min and at a stirring speed of 300 rpm. Data were subsequently imported into ORIGIN software and processed as recommended by the manufacturer. Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis for maximum accuracy. Protein Cross-linking—Toll and Toll-C106 mixture with an approximate protein concentration of 1 mg/ml were dialyzed into 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Subsequently, Sulfo-GMBS (N-(γ-maleimidobutylody)sulfosuccinimide ester) (10.2 Å spacer arm) and Sulfo-KMUS (N-(κ-maleimidoundecanoyloxy)sulfosuccinimide ester) (15.7-Å spacer arm) were added from 10 mm stocks (in dimethyl sulfoxide) to 140 μl of sample as indicated in Fig. 2A and the final volume adjusted to 150 μl with buffer. The samples were incubated at ambient temperature for 45 min, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 5 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 8.8 (to 90 mm). Sample buffer and reducing agent were added and the samples analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—All analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed on an Optima XL-A/I (Beckman Coulter) centrifuge equipped with a four-hole titanium rotor, double-sector centerpieces, and an interference optical system for data acquisition. For the analysis of the Toll-C106 1:1 complex and the Toll monomer-dimer equilibrium sedimentation velocity runs were performed at 55,000 rpm (3 or 2 min between scans, respectively) at 20 °C. The sample volume was 400 μl. Data were analyzed using Sedfit software. The partial specific volumes, buffer density, and viscosity were estimated using SEDINTERP software (20Laue T. Shah B. Ridgeway T. Pelletier S. Harding S. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed with an Optima XL-A/I (Beckman Coulter) using double-sector centerpieces and the interference optical system for data acquisition. Three concentrations of Toll were used (2, 16, and 42 μm), and data were acquired at speeds of 8000 rpm and 13,000 rpm, respectively. The equilibrium data were analyzed using SEDPHAT software (21Vistica J. Dam J. Balbo A. Yikilmaz E. Mariuzza R.A. Rouault T.A. Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 234-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assays—HEK (human embryonic kidney) 293 cells were grown in DMEM medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and l-glutamine (2 mm) and transfected in 60-mm dishes at a density of 4 × 106. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and either 2 μg of empty pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) or pCDNA3.1 plasmids expressing Toll, the Toll-hTLR4 chimera 1 (Toll residues 1–845 fused to hTLR4 residues 622–799), or 2 (Toll residues 1–802 fused to hTLR 590–799), respectively, as well as 0.2 μg of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the NFκB (nuclear factor κB) promoter (Promega). Cells were seeded into white 96-well plates and 36 h later were stimulated with media, Spätzle C106 dilutions, or human IL-1 at 10 ng/ml for 6 (data not shown) and 24 h. Luciferase production was measured after washing with phosphate-buffered saline and phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions and subsequent addition of LucLite luciferase lysis and reporter buffer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sample analysis was carried out on a Microbeta counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in triplicates. Sequence Alignments—Sequences for residues 754–883 of Toll and 542–660 of human TLR4 were aligned using ClustalW, formatted using JOY software (22Mizuguchi K. Deane C.M. Blundell T.L. Johnson M.S. Overingon J.P. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Studies Indicate a Complex Binding Reaction between Toll and Spätzle—We used ITC to study the thermodynamics and the stoichiometry of binding between full-length and a truncated Toll ectodomain and active, dimeric Spätzle ligand (Spz C106). Purified Toll ectodomain was titrated into the ITC measuring cell containing Spätzle C106 protein (Fig. 1A). This results in the formation of a complex of two ectodomains binding 1 Spätzle dimer with a measured dissociation constant of 82 nm. By contrast, in the reciprocal titration in which C106 was injected into Toll ectodomain, a complex with a 1:1 stochiometry and a significantly higher dissociation constant of ∼30 nm was observed (Fig. 1B). This difference in affinity shows that the binding of a first Toll molecule reduces the affinity for the second binding event and therefore that the two binding events are non-equivalent. Other thermodynamic parameters were also recorded and are summarized in Table I. The changes in Gibbs free energy are the same in both experiments, implying that both titrations describe the same binding process. This is also supported by the measured changes of enthalpy for which a factor of 2, due to the divalence of the C106 ligand, has to be taken into account.Table ISummary ITC dataSyringeCellExperimental values*ProteinCProteinCNKDΔHΔSΔGμmμmnmkcal/molcal/mol/Kkcal/molToll148C1064.982.12:182.0-7.377.72-9.67Toll5B105C1064.982.05:191.7-7.457.2-9.5C10645.5Toll5.160.89:129.5-14.5-14.24-10.3C10645.5Toll5B4.190.79:127.4-14.9-15.46-10.3 Open table in a new tab ITC experiments were also performed using Toll5B, a truncated ectodomain lacking 133 amino acids of sequence including a substantial portion of the second LRR block and the Cys-rich C-terminal flank (see Fig. 4), a motif known to be important for signaling. Titrations with Toll5B gave the same values as the full-length ectodomains, which indicates that LRR block II and the C-terminal Cys-rich flank do not make contributions to the binding of the ligand. Cross-linking Studies and Analytical Ultracentrifugation Confirm the Existence of Both 2:1 and 1:1 Complexes of Toll and Spätzle—To validate the existence of the 2 different stoichiometries found for complexes between Toll and Spätzle, we first sought to confirm the existence of a 2:1 complex using chemical cross-linking. Bifunctional reagents were added to a Toll → C106 mixture at increasing concentrations and incubated for 45 min at ambient temperature, and the mixtures were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). The addition of Sulfo-GMBS cross-linker to the Toll-Spätzle sample results in the appearance of a 240-kDa band. A similar result is obtained when another cross-linking reagent, Sulfo-KMUS, is used (Fig. 2A). The 240-kDa band is likely to correspond to a protein complex consisting of two Toll monomers of ∼110 kDa and one C106 dimer with 24 kDa. To confirm the existence of a 1:1 complex we had to use an experimental technique in which the excess of C106 necessary to maintain a 1:1 stoichiometry was not removed, as occurs in gel filtration. We therefore performed sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation on a mixture of Toll with a molar excess of C106. Analysis of the data for the Toll-Spätzle complex showed a predominant species with a sedimentation behavior equivalent to a molecular mass of 134 kDa (Fig. 2B), correlating well with the estimated mass of a 1:1 complex. Full-length Toll Ectodomain Forms a Weakly Associated Dimer in Solution—It has been shown that some receptor ectodomains exist as preformed dimers (Ref. 23Livnah O. Stura E.A. Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1999; 283: 987-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar and references therein). To test whether the complex binding of Toll to C106 could potentially be influenced by such a phenomenon, we again used analytical ultracentrifugation (sedimentation velocity) to analyze the oligomerization state of Toll ectodomain in solution. As shown from a c(S) analysis (Fig. 3A), there are two species present in solution, having sedimentation coefficients of 5 and 6 S, respectively. The corresponding c(M) analysis revealed that the molecular masses of these species are ∼90 and 170 kDa, respectively. The first is consistent with a Toll monomer and the second with a Toll dimer. The slightly lower mass for the dimers probably reflects a difference in the diffusion coefficient for the monomer and dimer, which is not taken into account in the analysis. We then characterized the association of Toll using sedimentation equilibrium experiments. These were conducted at three different concentrations of Toll ectodomain, 2, 16, and 42 μm. The results, as shown in Fig. 3B, were fit to a monomer-dimer model. The quality of the data is excellent and the local root mean square deviation for each fit was 0.01. The recovered monomer molecular mass was 87,472 ± 0.5 Da and the dissociation constant, Kd, is 2 μm. This result suggests that, in contrast to C106 binding, dimerization of Toll is of low affinity but comparable with p75, a receptor for the neurotrophin NGF (24He X.L. Garcia K.C. Science. 2004; 304: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), a structural homologue of Spätzle C106. Thus, it is possible that binding of the ligand displaces binding interfaces and that receptor dimerization modulates C106 binding. A Partial Ectodomain Lacking the N-terminal Block of LRRs Forms a Stable Dimer with Full-length Toll—We have gained further insights into the Toll-Toll interaction by studying the properties of an N-terminal deletion of the Toll ectodomain, TollΔN (Fig. 4B). As shown by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 4A), this ∼55-kDa fragment was found to co-purify with full-length Toll ectodomain in the Ni-NTA elution fraction when expression in baculovirus infected cells was allowed to continue beyond 48 h after infection. N-terminal protein sequencing and anti-His immunoblot (Fig. 4A), respectively, revealed that the fragment started with the sequence DIMLQT (corresponding to residue 458 of the full-length Toll construct) and confirmed that it had an intact C terminus. Thus, this fragment includes protein domains C-terminal of LRR block I, which is the first C-terminal cysteine-rich motif, and LRR block II with adjacent N- and C-terminal flanking regions (Fig. 4B). Analysis of the Ni-NTA sample containing the full-length Toll ectodomain and the fragment by gel filtration through a Superdex S200 column (Fig. 4C) showed a major peak (Peak 2) at an elution volume (Ve) = 10.5 ml corresponding to an approximate molecular mass of ∼160 kDa. SDS-PAGE analysis of this peak showed it contained both full-length and truncated Toll (Fig. 4D); peak 1 fractions did not contain proteins corresponding in size to Toll or TollΔN or cross-reacting with anti-His antibodies. Two alternative interpretations of this result are either that the TollΔN truncation is able to form a stable complex with the full-length protein or that the truncated TollΔN forms homodimers with a molecular mass similar to that of Toll. Gel filtration of a pure sample of full-length Toll ectodomains (data not shown) gave a single peak at Ve = 11.1 ml, and the shapes of the elution peaks in both gel filtrations are similar (same full width at half-maximum). Because peak 2 is shifted to a smaller Ve relative to that of Toll alone, the first explanation appears more likely as such a shift is consistent with the formation of a higher molecular mass species, that is Toll + TollΔN. This suggests that the deletion of the first LRR block, as occurs in TollΔN, results in a stable high affinity receptor-receptor interaction caused by binding between structural features C-terminal of LRR block I, whereas untruncated receptor molecules interact less stably and with low affinity (see Fig. 3). Critical Role of the Transmembrane and Juxtamembrane Sequences in the Regulation of Toll Signaling—Given that the analysis of the TollΔN fragment suggested that the C-terminal residues of Toll are important in Toll-Toll interactions, we next sought to determine whether other regions of the receptor, such as the juxtamembrane or transmembrane regions also have an influence on signaling. As these sequences are not involved in ligand binding any effect must be secondary in nature, for example by allowing receptor-receptor interactions to occur. To determine whether the transmembrane region of Drosophila Toll and that of the human Toll-like receptor 4 fulfil a comparable functional role, receptor chimeras were prepared as illustrated in Fig. 5A. Chimera 1 consists of the Drosophila Toll ectodomain and transmembrane segment and the hTLR4 TIR domain, and chimera 2 consists of the Drosophila Toll ectodomain but the hTLR4 transmembrane and TIR domains (Fig. 5C). As shown in Fig. 5B in both cases Spz C106 is able to stimulate activation of an NFκB reporter gene in transfected HEK293 cells and the dose-response curve is comparable with that seen in Drosophila cells (5Weber A. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J. Lelièvre E. Gascan H. Ray K. Morse M. Imler J. Gay N. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). However, in the case of chimera 2 there is a substantial level of constitutive activation. This suggests that there is an important role for the transmembrane α-helix in suppressing signaling activity and that there are significant mechanistic differences in the activation of the Drosophila Toll and hTLR 4 pathways. This may be indicated by the sequence divergence evident in this region when the two sequences are aligned (Fig. 5C). In this paper we present biophysical analyses of the interaction between the ectodomain of Toll and the dimeric ligand Spätzle. Our ITC data show that two thermodynamically similar modes of binding exist in solution: a 1:1 complex existing when Spätzle C106 is in excess and a 2:1 complex predominating when Toll is in excess. Interpretation of the dissociation constants (Kd) measured in these titrations indicates that the first and the second binding event are non-equivalent and that the first event has a significantly higher affinity of binding than the second. This suggests negative cooperativity, the first binding event could for example cause structural changes in the symmetrical binding sites in the C106 dimer. Interestingly, a structural study has recently been published of NGF, a dimeric cystine knot ligand structurally related to Spätzle (19Mizuguchi K. Parker J.S. Blundell T.L. Gay N.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 239-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), bound to a single molecule of the receptor p75 (24He X.L. Garcia K.C. Science. 2004; 304: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In this report, the authors show that p75 interacts with two discontinuous sites at the interface of the NGF homodimer and that this first binding event induces a certain amount of structural distortion in the ligand, which disables the second putative p75-binding site in the NGF homodimer. The authors also present biophysical data supporting the 1:1 stoichiometry for NGF:p75, notably an ITC titration of NGF into a concentrated solution of p75, an experiment comparable with that presented in Fig. 1, A and C, which also gives a 1:1 stoichiometry (the reciprocal titration was not presented). Our results suggest that allosteric changes occur in the C106:Toll complex and point to similarities between C106 and NGF in receptor interaction. However, in contrast to NGF:p75, the allosteric changes in the C106:Toll complex do not preclude the recruitment of a second receptor molecule. Negative cooperation may help explain the phenotype of the class II of dominant alleles mentioned above. In wild-type embryos, C106 generated in close proximity of the membrane is immediately trapped by Toll (C106 can only be isolated from the perivitelline fluid of Toll–/– embryos, not wild-type embryos (25Stein D. Nusslein-Volhard C. Cell. 1992; 68: 429-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)). By contrast, in type II mutants, C106 encountering a soluble Toll receptor is less likely to interact at the cell surface with full-length receptor, as this second interaction occurs with a lower affinity, thus increasing the ability of C106 to diffuse before eliciting a signal. The ITC experiments show that the binding of C106 to the truncated Type II ectodomain Toll5B is indistinguishable from that of the full-length protein. Although the exact residues involved in ligand binding remain to be defined more precisely, this implies that the second block of LRRs and the membrane proximal cysteine-rich flank are not involved in ligand binding. This is consistent with the earlier notion that Toll type II dominant alleles bind to Spätzle C106 despite the fact that they are truncated ectodomains (13Schneider D.S. Hudson K.L. Lin T.Y. Anderson K.V. Gene Dev. 1991; 5: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) (5Weber A. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J. Lelièvre E. Gascan H. Ray K. Morse M. Imler J. Gay N. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In fact, the shortest of these, Tl84C (truncation at residue 464; see schematic in Fig. 4B), comprises only Toll N-terminal features and the first 13 LRRs, and this suggests that the binding site for Spätzle is contained within this region. The extracellular LRRs of Toll are likely to adopt a concave structure similar to that seen in glycoprotein Ib (26Weber A.N. Morse M.A. Gay N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34589-34594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and it is interesting to note that the NGF binding sites of p75 are found in a similar extended concave structure formed, in that case, by cysteine rich regions (27He X.L.L. Bazan J.F. McDermott G. Park J.B. Wang K. Tessier-Lavigne M. He Z.G. Garcia K.C. Neuron. 2003; 38: 177-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It is plausible that, like NGF, Spätzle has two discontinuous binding sites arranged tangentially to the LRR superhelix in the Toll ectodomain. Localization of the Spz binding site to the first block of LRRs suggests that the second block, the cysteine-rich flank, and transmembrane α-helix play an indirect role in receptor activation or regulation. Our experiments shed some light on their respective functions. We present evidence suggesting that LRR block 2 and other C-terminal features are involved in mediating receptor-receptor contacts and that removal of the Toll N terminus results in a strong association between these regions. This suggests that in the absence of C106, the N-terminal ligand binding domain is required to suppress strong Toll-Toll interaction and thus prevents receptor signaling in the absence of ligand. We suggest that ligand binding relieves this constraint by introducing conformational changes that subsequently bring Toll receptors into closer proximity and thereby allow signaling through their intracytoplasmic domains. This is similar to a proposal based on time resolved fluorescence imaging microscopy studies for the EGF receptor (28Gadella Jr., T.W. Jovin T.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1543-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). These experiments indicate that the EGF receptor undergoes a substantial structural rearrangement upon ligand binding, involving the rotation of the ectodomains. Previous findings that Toll transmembrane and intracellular domains on their own are constitutively active (29Winans K.A. Hashimoto C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30Hu X. Yagi Y. Tanji T. Zhou S. Ip Y.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2000; 97: 10520-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and that there is an unstable association of Toll ectodomains as shown in this study highlight the importance of the relative spatial arrangement of extra- and intracellular domains determined by juxta- and transmembrane regions. This is demonstrated by the properties of the constitutively active Type 1 dominant Toll receptors and second by the experiments described above, which show that swapping of the transmembrane domain derepresses the receptor. This indicates that in the inactive state, these motifs are arranged in a way that prevents receptor self-association together with N-terminal features (see above). The disulfide bonds of the C-terminal flank may confer a conformational rigidity on the juxtamembrane region that is disrupted in the Type 1 mutants or relieved upon ligand binding, enabling receptor self-association. In the related LRR receptor glycoprotein Ib, for example, binding of von Willebrand factor domain A causes the corresponding cysteine rich domain to switch from a coil structure to an anti-parallel β-sheet (32Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A.P. Schiphorst M.E. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), which illustrates the conformational flexibility of these LRR flanking sequences. A similar mechanism for Toll receptor activation has recently been proposed by Hu et al. (30Hu X. Yagi Y. Tanji T. Zhou S. Ip Y.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9369-9374Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) who further suggest that the free cysteine generated in the Type 1 dominant mutants is activated by formation of a covalent cross-link with another receptor. However, we were unable to show that one of these dominant alleles (Toll10B) in embryos (rather than overexpressed by transgenes) was cross-linked in this way. 2N. J. Gay, unpublished results. It is likely that repression of signaling function associated with the C-terminal flank is strongly influenced by the transmembrane domain of the receptor. Thus, the replacement of sequences including just 4 amino acids predicted to lie outside the membrane causes a substantial level of constitutive activation in Toll-TLR4 chimeric receptors (Fig. 4B). This points to differences in the role of juxta- and transmembrane regions in the regulation and activation of Drosophila and human Toll receptors signal transduction. Taken together our results suggest a model of activation for Drosophila Toll which is illustrated in Fig. 6. This mechanism has features in common with that elucidated for the EGF receptor (see Introduction). However, in that case the binding of monovalent EGF to two receptor molecules facilitates receptor self-association, whereas we propose that ligand induced dimerization causes secondary receptor-receptor interactions, which stabilize the signaling complex. Further structural studies of Toll ectodomains or Toll-Spätzle complexes, as well as experiments addressing Toll-Spätzle interactions on the cell surface, will be required to validate this model. It will also be interesting to investigate the relevance of this model for the activation of mammalian TLRs. The best characterized TLR at this stage is TLR4, which is activated by lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria. Recent results indicate that activation of TLR4 requires the secreted accessory molecule MD-2 and that binding of lipopolysaccharide induces a conformational change in the TLR4-MD-2 complex (33Akashi S.

https://openalex.org/W2170642535,"Myocilin is a secreted glycoprotein of unknown function that is ubiquitously expressed in many human organs, including the eye. Mutations in this protein produce glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness worldwide. To explore the biological role of myocilin and the pathogenesis of glaucoma, we have analyzed the expression of recombinant wild type and four representative pathogenic myocilin mutations (E323K, Q368X, P370L, and D380A) in transiently transfected cell lines derived from ocular and nonocular tissues. We found that wild type myocilin undergoes an intracellular endoproteolytic processing at the C terminus of Arg226. This cleavage predicts the production of two fragments, one of 35 kDa containing the C-terminal olfactomedin-like domain, and another of 20 kDa containing the N-terminal leucine zipper-like domain. Here we have analyzed the 35-kDa processed fragment, and we have found that it is co-secreted with the nonprocessed protein. Western immunoblot analyses showed that human aqueous humor and some ocular tissues also contain the processed 35-kDa myocilin, indicating that the endoproteolytic cleavage occurs in vivo. Mutant myocilins accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum of transfected cells as insoluble aggregates. Interestingly, the four pathogenic myocilins inhibited the endoproteolytic processing with varying efficiency. Furthermore, the mutation P370L, which produces the most severe glaucoma phenotype, also elicited the most potent endoproteolytic cleavage inhibition. We propose that the endoproteolytic processing might regulate the activity of myocilin and that the inhibition of the processing by pathogenic mutations impairs the normal role of myocilin.

Furthermore, the mutation P370L, which produces the most severe glaucoma phenotype, also elicited the most potent endoproteolytic cleavage inhibition. We propose that the endoproteolytic processing might regulate the activity of myocilin and that the inhibition of the processing by pathogenic mutations impairs the normal role of myocilin. Myocilin is a glycoprotein of unknown function, originally identified in cultured trabecular meshwork cells upon induction with glucocorticoids (1Polansky J.R. Lutjen-Drecoll Basic Aspects of Glaucoma Research III. Schattauer Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany1993: 307-318Google Scholar, 2Polansky J.R. Fauss D.J. Chen P. Chen H. Lutjen-Drecoll E. Johnson D.

The cDNA was independently cloned from a subtracted ciliary body cDNA library (3Escribano J. Ortego J. Coca-Prados M. J. Biochem.

Genomics. 1997; 41: 360-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although the myocilin mRNA has been found to be ubiquitously expressed in many human tissues, its highest abundance appears to be restricted to tissues of the eye such as the iris, ciliary body, and trabecular meshwork (3Escribano J. Ortego J. Coca-Prados M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 921-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Ortego J. Escribano J. Coca-Prados M.

Ophthalmic Genet. 2000; 21: 155-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene encoding myocilin is currently referred to as MYOC. It consists of three different sized exons. The amino-terminal region of myocilin, encoded by exon 1, contains a peptide signal sequence (amino acids 1–32) and a leucine zipper-like motif composed of about 50 amino acid residues (amino acids 117–169) with periodic arginine and leucine repeats arranged along an α-helix (4Ortego J. Escribano J. Coca-Prados M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The finding of this amphipathic structure suggested that it might participate in molecular interactions (7Coca-Prados M. Escribano J. Ortego J. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 403-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In fact, myocilin-myocilin interactions have been described to occur mainly within amino acids 117–166, in the region containing the leucine zipper-like domain (8Fautsch M.P. Johnson D.H. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2324-2331PubMed Google Scholar). The central region of the protein (amino acids 203–245) is encoded by exon 2, and neither structural nor functional domains have been described in this location so far. The carboxyl-terminal half of myocilin, encoded by exon 3, is homologous to olfactomedin, an extracellular matrix protein of unknown role, that is abundant in the olfactory neuroepithelium (9Bal R.S. Anholt R.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1047-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This domain contains a single disulfide bond connecting cysteine residues 245 and 433 (10Nagy I. Trexler M. Patthy L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly enough, most mutations (missense) reported so far in the MYOC gene in glaucoma patients are heterozygous and are confined to exon 3 (4Ortego J. Escribano J. Coca-Prados M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 11Sarfarazi M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Rozsa F.W. Shimizu S.

Myocilin is intracellularly distributed in vesicles (14Stamer W.D. Roberts B.C. Howell D.N. Epstein D.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

The doublet is caused by glycosylated and nonglycosylated molecules (2Polansky J.R. Fauss D.J. Chen P. Chen H. Lutjen-Drecoll E. Johnson D. Kurtz R.M. Ma Z.D. Bloom E. Nguyen T.D.

Myocilin has also been localized to the Golgi apparatus of both Schlemm's canal cells (21O'Brien E.T. Ren X. Wang Y. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3842-3849PubMed Google Scholar) and corneal fibroblasts (22Wentz-Hunter K. Shen X. Yue B.Y. Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 308-314PubMed Google Scholar). Glaucoma is a complex and genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by the progressive apoptotic death of retinal ganglion cells that leads to excavation of the optic nerve head and to visual field loss, eventually producing blindness (23Quigley H.A.

Mutations in the MYOC gene cause autosomal dominant juvenile glaucoma (GLC1A) and a subset of adult onset primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). The best known risk factor associated with POAG is an increased intraocular pressure. The molecular pathway from the glaucoma genotype to the phenotype is not straightforward, and it probably involves a chain of subtle events. Over recent years, some of these events have been unraveled and have shown, for instance, that mutant forms of myocilin are not secreted in cultured cells; rather, they accumulate intracellularly as misfolded proteins. This leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress and to potential cytotoxicity (16Caballero M. Rowlette L.L. Borras T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 447-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 18Jacobson N. Andrews M. Shepard A.R. Nishimura D. Searby C. Fingert J.H. Hageman G. Mullins R. Davidson B.L. Kwon Y.H.

Although certain molecular mechanisms such as homoallelic complementation, haploinsuffiency, or negative dominant effect have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of myocilin glaucoma, most experimental evidence supports the gain of function theory (27Morissette J.

Here we show for the first time that wild type myocilin is endoproteolytically processed, probably in the ER, and that pathogenic glaucoma mutations significantly inhibit this proteolytic processing. This work provides new insights not only into the physiological function of myocilin but also into the role it plays in the pathogenesis of POAG. Myocilin Constructs—Total RNA was extracted from 20 mg of frozen human skeletal muscle mechanically homogenized using Tri-Reagent (Sigma). Primers 5′-CGGAATTCTGATGAGGTTCTTCTGTGCACG-3′ (primer 1) and 5′-GCGGGATCCATCTTGGAGAGCTTGATGTC-3′ (primer 2) were employed to amplify human myocilin cDNA from the RNA preparation using the AccessQuick™ RT-PCR System (Promega). The sequence of primers was designed so that the PCR product incorporated EcoRI and BamHI restriction cleavage sites. The obtained cDNA, which contained the full-length myocilin sequence, including its signal peptide, was cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(–) (Invitrogen). This vector was previously adapted by inserting coding sequences for Myc and His epitopes or green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the BamHI-HindIII sites. DNA from the wild type myocilin cloned in the pcDNA 3.1 vector containing Myc-His epitopes was used as a template to produce different point mutations with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The specific PCR primers used for mutagenesis were as follows: 5′-CCTAGGCCACTGAAAAGCACGGGTGCTGTG-3′ and 5′-CACAGCACCCGTGCTTTTCAGTGGCCTAGG-3′ for E323K; 5′-CCACGGACAGTTCCTGTATTCTTGGGGTGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCACCCCAAGAATACAGGAACTGTCCGTGG-3′ for P370L; and 5′-GGCTACACGGATATCGCCTTGGCTGTGGATG-3′ and 5′-CATCCACAGCCAAGGCGATATCCGTGTAGCC-3′ for D380A. The truncated version of myocilin Q368X was also produced by PCR using the following primers: 5′-CGGAATTCTGATGAGGTTCTTCTGTGCACG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCCCGTGGTAGCCAGCTCC-3′. The mutated cDNAs were subcloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(–) adapted as described above. To prepare the deletion construct R226-E230del, two PCR fragments were first amplified from each side of the deletion using as template the full-length myocilin cDNA cloned as described above. The 5′ portion of this construct was amplified using primer 1 and the deletion-specific antisense primer 5′-CCTGAGATAGCCAGATGGGCTGGAAGCAGGAACTTCAGTTAGC-3′. The 3′ portion was amplified using the deletion-specific sense primer 5′-GCTAACTGAAGTTCCTGCTTCCAGCCCATCTGGCTATCTCAGG-3′ and primer 2. The primary PCR products were mixed and used as a template in a secondary PCR with primers 1 and 2. The PCR fragment containing the deleted region was directly cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of the pcDNA3.1-Myc-His vector. All of the DNA constructs obtained were sequenced to confirm both the correct insertion and absence of undesirable mutations. Tissues and Cell Lines—Bovine and human eyes were obtained from a local slaughterhouse or from human cadavers within 24 h after enucleation through the National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia, PA), respectively. Human aqueous humor samples were collected from patients undergoing intraocular surgery after obtaining informed consents. Investigation of the human subjects was approved by the Human Subjects Committee of Yale University and followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, as far as it applies. Eyes were microdissected from the posterior pole, both the vitreous and lens were removed, and the ciliary body and iris were microdissected. Homogenization of ciliary body and iris was performed by mechanical grinding with liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. Pulverized frozen tissue was suspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF), vortexed for 30 s at maximum speed, and incubated for 30 min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were stored at –80 °C until used. Monkey kidney COS1 and human embryonic kidney 293T cell lines were bought from the ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). The human cell lines 26HCMsv and 59HIsv were established from primary cultures of ciliary muscle cells of a 26-year-old male (cadaver) and from the iris pigmented epithelial cells of a 59-year-old male (cadaver) respectively, by viral transformation, as previously described (30Coca-Prados M. Wax M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The four cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Normocin; Invitrogen) at 37 °C, in a fully humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cell Transfections—Cells growing in 6-well plates at 70–80% cell confluence were transiently transfected with 0.5–1.0 μg of plasmid DNA using the Superfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. In order to avoid proteolytic degradation of secreted recombinant myocilin, a commercial mixture of proteinase inhibitors for specific use in culture media (Sigma) was used. Forty-eight h after transfection, the culture medium was collected. To remove cellular debris from the collected culture medium, samples were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was stored at –80 °C until used. Adhered cells were washed twice with 1 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 6 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2), followed by an addition of 200 μl of lysis buffer containing proteinase inhibitors. Collected cells were vortexed for 30 s at maximum speed, incubated for 30 min on ice, and sonicated for 10 s (cycle 0.5 s). Cells lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (cellular soluble fraction) were carefully separated from the pellets (cellular insoluble fraction). Both cellular fractions were stored at –80 °C until used. The efficiency of transfections was estimated in cells transiently transfected with a cDNA construct encoding myocilin-GFP, by counting the number of GFP-positive cells in a total of 103 cells in four randomly selected areas per dish. The average transfection efficiency was 20–25%. As negative control, the different cell lines were transfected with 0.5 μg of the nonrecombinant pcDNA3.1-vector. Western Blotting and Antibodies—Analytical 10% polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS was performed as reported by Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), using the Mini-PROTEAN III gel electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (32Wilson C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis aliquots of culture medium, intracellular fractions of cultured cell lines (both soluble and insoluble) or tissue extracts and aqueous humor were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The samples were normalized for protein content using the Bradford assay. Gels were subsequently transferred onto Hybond ECL nitrocelulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) for immunodetection or onto Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp.) for N-terminal microsequencing. Anti-myocilin antibodies R14T, C21A, or a commercial mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were used as primary antibodies diluted at 1:400–1:500. Antibodies R14T and C21A were raised in rabbits immunized with synthetic myocilin peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 272–285 and 468–488, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1) (6Huang W. Jaroszewski J. Ortego J. Escribano J. Coca-Prados M. Ophthalmic Genet. 2000; 21: 155-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against either mouse or rabbit IgG (Pierce) were diluted at 1:1000. Chemiluminiscence was performed with Supersignal Dura Western blot reagents (Pierce). Densitometry for protein band quantitation was performed on scanned films using Quantity One 4.1 analysis software (Bio-Rad) on triplicate independent experiments. Data were statistically treated by using SigmaStat 2.0 software (SPSS Science). Inhibition of Protein Secretion with Brefeldin A (BFA) or Monensin— Following transfection with different myocilin constructs, cells were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and further cultured for 3 h with culture medium containing either BFA (Fluka) (1 μg/ml) or monensin (Sigma) (0.32 μg/ml). To remove the recombinant protein secreted before adding the inhibitors, the culture medium was eliminated, and adhered cells were briefly washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and cultured for 24 h with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing BFA or monensin. The culture medium and cells were processed as described above. Nickel-chelating Chromatography of Recombinant Myocilin—Recombinant wild type myocilin was isolated by nickel-chelating chromatography using a Hi-Trap Chelating HP 1-ml column (Amersham Biosciences). Two ml of culture medium from transiently transfected 293T cells were equilibrated in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl) containing 5 mm imidazole, using Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Corp.) with a nominal molecular mass limit of 30 kDa. The column was charged with 1 ml of 50 mm NiSO4 and washed with 5 ml of binding buffer to remove any excess of NiSO4. Two ml of equilibrated culture medium were loaded in the column. The column was eluted with 5 ml of binding buffer followed by 5 ml of the same buffer containing 75 mm imidazole. The retained molecules were eluted with 3 ml of binding buffer containing 1 m imidazole. The presence of myocilin in the collected samples was tested by Western blot analysis with the anti-Myc 9E10 antibody. N-terminal Amino Acid Sequence Analysis and Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) Peptide Mass Fingerprint Analysis—The 35-kDa myocilin band isolated by nickel chelating chromatography was characterized by both N-terminal sequencing and MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprinting. N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation was performed using a sample separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp.), as described above. The membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the 35-kDa band was cut and loaded into a Procise 494 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). For MALDI-TOF analysis, another aliquot was separated by SDS-PAGE with silver staining. The 35-kDa band was excised with a scalpel and subjected to in-gel digestion as reported elsewhere (33Li G. Waltham M. Anderson N.L. Unsworth E. Treston A. Weinstein J.N. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The digest was analyzed in a MALDI-TOF/TOF 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) in the proteomics facility of the “Parque Científico de Madrid.” External calibration was performed using a mixture of angiotensin II, ACTH/CLIP, bombesin, and somatostatin. Data base searching was performed with ProteinProspector MS-Fit (available on the World Wide Web at prospector.ucsf.edu). Fluorescence Microscopy—293T cells were seeded in coverslips placed into 6-well plates. They were transfected with DNA constructs encoding different myocilin-GFP variants. DNA constructs encoding GFP-tagged versions of the first 80 N-terminal amino acids of galactosyl-transferase or the signal peptide of calreticulin were used as specific fluorescent Golgi and ER markers, respectively. These constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Juan Llopis (Facultad de Medicina/CRIB, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Spain). All transfections were performed with SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). After transfection, cells were washed once with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and cultured for 24 h. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Finally, the coverslips were mounted on glass slides using polyvinyl alcohol mounting medium with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Fluka) and viewed under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMR/XA) with proper filter sets, using a ×100 plan objective. Images were captured using a Leica DC500 digital camera. Affinity Purification of Myocilin—The anti-peptide antibody (IgG) C21A was immobilized to a commercially available resin support according to the manufacturer's instructions (AminoLink Plus Activated Support) (Pierce). The soluble fraction (1 mg of protein) of a human ciliary body extract was incubated with the resin to capture the target protein (myocilin). The resin was washed and eluted following the manufacturer's recommendations. Fifty μg of eluted protein were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a membrane, and probed with either R14T or C21A anti-peptide antibodies directed against the N- and C-terminal regions of the olfactomedin-like domain of myocilin, respectively (6Huang W. Jaroszewski J. Ortego J. Escribano J. Coca-Prados M. Ophthalmic Genet. 2000; 21: 155-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bioinformatics—A search for myocilin domains was performed in the collection of protein families and domains contained in the Pfam data base (34Bateman A. Coin L. Durbin R. Finn R.D. Hollich V. Griffiths-Jones S. Khanna A. Marshall M. Moxon S. Sonnhammer E.L. Studholme D.J. Yeats C. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D138-D141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (available on the World Wide Web at www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/). Prediction for proteinase cleavage sites was performed using the Web-based data base of eukaryotic linear motifs (ELM) (available on the World Wide Web at elm.eu.org/) (35Puntervoll P. Linding R. Gemund C. Chabanis-Davidson S. Mattingsdal M. Cameron S. Martin D.M. Ausiello G. Brannetti B. Costantini A. Ferre F. Maselli V. Via A. Cesareni G. Diella F. Superti-Furga G. Wyrwicz L. Ramu C. McGuigan C. Gudavalli R. Letunic I. Bork P. Rychlewski L. Kuster B. Helmer-Citterich M. Hunter W.N. Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3625-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Expression of Wild Type Myocilin in Cultured Cell Lines and Ocular Mammalian Tissues—In a first approach to characterize the synthesis and secretion of wild type myocilin, COS1 and 293T cells were chosen, since they are reliable models for producing recombinant eukaryotic proteins. We also established the cell lines 26HCMsv and 59HIsv, derived from the human ciliary muscle and the human iris pigmented epithelial cells, respectively, to set up an expression model closer to ocular tissues where the MYOC gene is physiologically transcribed. Transient cell transfections were optimized in all of the cell lines by using varying amounts of DNA (0.5–4.0 μg). In these analyses, secreted and intracellular myocilin was detected by Western immunoblot at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after transfection by using the anti-Myc 9E10 antibody. The most appropriate production of wild type myocilin was accomplished at 48 h post-transfection with 0.5–1.0 μg of DNA (data not shown). These conditions were used in subsequent experiments. Western blot analysis employing the anti-myocilin R14T antibody, which binds to a peptide located at the beginning of the olfactomedin-like domain (Supplementary Fig. 1), showed that myocilin was present in the culture medium of the four transfected cell lines (293T, COS1, 59HIsv, 26HCMsv) as two major bands of nearly 55 and 35 kDa (Fig. 1A, culture medium lanes). The 55-kDa band was resolved as a doublet when films were shortly exposed. This doublet is due to differential glycosylation of secreted myocilin. Overexposed films revealed that the 35-kDa band was also present intracellularly, as seen in Fig. 1B (see arrow), where the overexposed intracellular fraction of 293T cells is shown as a representative example. The 35-kDa band was also seen in human aqueous humor as well as in bovine iris and ciliary body whole extracts (Fig. 1A, H. AH and Tissues lanes; see arrow). Nonetheless, it was detected in whole extracts from human iris and ciliary body only after overexposing the blots (data not shown). Full-length myocilin present in bovine tissues displayed an apparent molecular weight higher than that of myocilin visualized in human tissues or in cell lines. This is in accordance with previous studies (36Russell P. Tamm E.R. Grehn F.J. Picht G. Johnson M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 983-986PubMed Google Scholar). Since lengths of human and bovine myocilin polypeptide chains are approximately the same, this difference can be explained by distinct posttranslational modifications of the protein in these two species. The specificity of the anti-myocilin R14T antibody was shown by the absence of bands in control samples of culture medium and cell lysates from the four cell lines transfected with the nonrecombinant vector. Fig. 1A ((–) lanes) shows a representative result obtained with 26HCMsv cells. Moreover, in previous experiments, we determined that the use of preimmune serum or preincubation of the antibody with the immunizing peptide in Western blots did not recognize any band (data not shown), further supporting the specificity of the R14T antibody. To confirm that the human ciliary body produces the myocilin fragment, we isolated this polypeptide by affinity chromatography. The soluble protein from a ciliary body extract was fractionated using the resin-coupled C21A anti-myocilin antibody. Western immunoblot analysis with the R14T anti-m"
https://openalex.org/W2082439026,"Developmental axon competition plays a key role in sculpting neural circuitry. Here, we have asked how activity and neurotrophins could interact to select one axon over another. Using compartmented cultures of sympathetic neurons, we show that, in the presence of NGF, local depolarization confers a competitive growth advantage on the depolarized axon collaterals and at the same time disadvantages the growth of unstimulated axons from the same and competing neurons. Depolarization mediates the competitive advantage by activating a CaMKII-MEK pathway, which converges to enhance local NGF-mediated downstream growth signals. Patterned electrical stimulation also acts via this pathway to enhance NGF-promoted axonal growth. In contrast, the competitive disadvantage is due to BDNF secreted from and acting on the unstimulated, competing axons through p75NTR. Thus, activity regulates both positive and negative neurotrophin-derived signaling cascades to confer a competitive growth advantage on one axon versus another, thereby providing a cellular mechanism for developmental axon selection."

Two well characterized isoforms of the enzyme are known: a prokaryotic PanK that predominates in eubacteria and a eukaryotic isoform that has primarily been characterized from mammalian and plant sources. Curiously, the genomes of certain pathogenic bacteria, including Helicobacter pylori and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, do not contain a PanK similar to either isoform, although these organisms possess all the other biosynthetic machinery required for CoA production. In this study we cloned, overexpressed and characterized an enzyme from Bacillus subtilis and its homologue from H. pylori and show that they catalyze the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of pantothenate. These enzymes do not share sequence homology with any known PanK, and unlike the bacterial and eukaryotic PanK isoforms their activity is not regulated by either CoA or acetyl-CoA. They also do not accept the pantothenic acid antimetabolite N-pentylpantothenamide as a substrate or are inhibited by it. Taken together, these results point to the identification of a third distinct isoform of PanK that accounts for the only known activity of the enzyme in pathogens such as H. pylori and P. aeruginosa.

It is universally biosynthesized in five enzymatic steps from pantothenate (vitamin B5). The first of these, the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of pantothenate, is catalyzed by the enzyme pantothenate kinase (PanK). Currently two isoforms of the enzyme have been characterized: the first (Type I) is found predominantly in prokaryotic organisms and is exemplified by the Escherichia coli enzyme (EcCoaA) (3Song W.J. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6411-6417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second (Type II) occurs mainly in eukaryotic systems, of which the murine enzyme (MmPanK1β) has been the best characterized (4Rock C.O. Calder R.B. Karim M.A. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 2002; 291: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). While these two isoforms have little primary sequence similarity, both share a common regulation mechanism based on feedback inhibition by CoA and its thioesters, although the degree of inhibition is system- and inhibitor-dependent (4Rock C.O.

However, recent studies have found that this classification is not unambiguous, as the Staphylococcus aureus enzyme (SaCoaA) has a primary sequence that is closer related to Type II PanKs, and it is not regulated by feedback inhibition (12Leonardi R. Chohnan S. Zhang Y.M. Virga K.G. Lee R.E. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3314-3322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 13Choudhry A.E. Mandichak T.L.

Despite our extensive current knowledge of PanK enzymes the identification of this activity remains elusive in a subset of pathogenic bacteria that includes organisms such as Helicobacter pylori and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This fact was highlighted in two recent studies which used a comparative genomics approach to reconstruct the universal CoA biosynthetic pathway in representative organisms of all kingdoms (14Genschel U. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2004; 21: 1242-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Osterman A. Overbeek R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 238-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Among these, H. pylori and P. aeruginosa are examples of bacteria in which no putative PanK similar to either known isoform could be found, even though the four remaining CoA biosynthetic enzymes were clearly represented. Since PanK is an essential activity in these organisms, this suggested that at least one additional, uncharacterized isoform of PanK exists. A recent patent application has claimed that the Bacillus subtilis genome contains two separate gene sequences which, when cloned in trans, can each suppress the effects of an Escherichia coli temperature-sensitive mutant defective in Ec-CoaA activity (16.Yocum, R. R., and Patterson, T. A. (December 14, 2004) U. S. Patent 6,830,898Google Scholar). While one of these genes encodes the predicted model prokaryotic Type I PanK (BsCoaA), the other shows no homology to any known PanK. In support of the suggested duplication of PanK activity interruption of the putative coaA gene gave a normal growing phenotype, while a double mutant defective in both gene sequences was not viable. These results suggest that simultaneous deletion of both genes is lethal to B. subtilis and that the second gene (dubbed coaX by the authors) also encodes for a protein with PanK activity. Similarity-based genome searches using the coaX gene sequence identify homologues in a number of eubacteria (see Supplemental Table I). Included among these are various pathogenic bacteria such as H. pylori and P. aeruginosa in which the PanK-encoding gene was “missing” (15Osterman A. Overbeek R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 238-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), as well as others like Bordetella pertussis (the causative agent of whooping cough) and the category A biodefense pathogen, Francisella tularensis. Interestingly, the coaX homologue in B. pertussis has been studied before and was found to be an essential gene in this organism (17Wood G.E. Friedman R.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 193: 25-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18DeShazer D. Wood G.E. Friedman R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3801-3807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these studies concluded that the gene product was involved in pertussis toxin production via interaction with a two component transcriptional regulator, BvgAS. Most coaX homologues are currently annotated as Bvg accessory factors or as putative transcriptional regulators. In this paper we report the cloning, overexpression, and characterization of the coaX gene product from B. subtilis and its homologue from H. pylori and demonstrate that these proteins have PanK activity. However, our results show that in comparison to the Type I and Type II PanKs these enzymes exhibit distinctly different characteristics, suggesting that they are the first characterized examples of a third (Type III) PanK isoform. General—All chemicals were purchased from Aldrich, Sigma, or Fluka and were of the highest purity. ESI-MS analyses were performed at the Central Analytical Facility at Stellenbosch University on a Waters Micromass Q-TOF Ultima API mass spectrometer. SaCoaA was expressed and purified according to published methods, using BL21(DE3) (Novagen) as expression strain (13Choudhry A.E. Mandichak T.L. Broskey J.P. Egolf R.W. Kinsland C. Begley T.P. Seefeld M.A. Ku T.W. Brown J.R. Zalacain M. Ratnam K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 2051-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The SaCoaA expression plasmid was a gift from Cynthia Kinsland (Cornell University). EcCoaA was prepared by published methods (19Strauss E. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48205-48209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). All curve fitting analyses were performed using SigmaPlot 9.0 (Systat software). Construction of Expression Vectors—The B. subtilis coaX gene (yacB) 2The sequence of the B. subtilis yacB gene currently deposited in the various genome databases contains a sequencing error which results in the premature termination of the protein. A corrected sequence has been submitted to GenBank™ (accession number AY912104). was amplified by PCR from B. subtilis 168 genomic DNA using Pfu DNA polymerase and the following primers (Inqaba Biotechnology): 5′-CAAAAGTGGTGACATATGTTGTTACTGGTTATC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CCATATCAGTCGTTCTCGAGGCATAAGCCCGAAC-3′ (reverse primer). The H. pylori coaX (HP0682) gene was amplified by PCR from H. pylori genomic DNA (a gift from Paul van Helden and Rob Warren, Stellenbosch University) using Taq DNA polymerase and the following primers: 5′-ATAAGAAGTAGGCATATGCCAGCTAGGC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-ATGCCCAAAAAACTCGAGTTGTGCATC-3′ (reverse primer). Primers introduced either NdeI (forward primers) or XhoI (reverse primers) restriction sites (underlined). The resulting PCR products were digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated to NdeI/XhoI-digested pET28a expression vector (Novagen) using T4 DNA ligase. The sequences of the resulting plasmids, named pET28a-BsCoaX and pET-28a-HpCoaX respectively, were verified by automated DNA sequencing (Inqaba Biotechnology). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—pET28a-BsCoaX and pET28a-HpCoaX were transformed into E. coli BL21 Star(DE3) (Invitrogen). Protein expression was performed in LB media supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate at 37 °C. Expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (800 μm for BsCoaX and 100 μm for HpCoaX) at an A600 of ∼0.6, and the cells were grown overnight. Harvested cells were suspended in sonication buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9), sonicated, and centrifuged to clarify the cell-free extract. The proteins were purified using 1-ml HiTrap chelating columns (Amersham Biosciences) following the protocol provided by the suppliers and using sonication buffer as column solvent, except that BsCoaX was eluted from the column by using strip buffer (100 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) instead of imidazole. The purified protein solutions were exchanged to gel filtration buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 5% glycerol) using HiTrap desalting columns (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. Aliquots of the purified proteins were stored at –80 °C. Determination of Kinetic Parameters—PanK activity was measured by a coupled assay as described previously (19Strauss E. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48205-48209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). All reactions were performed at 25 °C in a Multiskan Spectrum multiplate spectrophotometer (Thermo Labsystems), using an extinction coefficient of 6220 m–1·cm–1 for NADH. Kinetic parameters were determined by global non-linear fitting of the initial rate data at varying ATP and pantothenate concentrations to the general equation for a steady-state bireactant model (20Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 138-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), V[E]=kcat·[A]·[B](K1A·KB+KA·[B]+KB·[A]+[A]·[B](Eq. 1) where A is ATP, B is pantothenate, E is enzyme, KA and KB are the Michaelis constants for ATP and pantothenate, respectively, and K1A is the enzyme dissociation constant. Each 300 μl reaction mixture contained 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm PEP, 0.3 mm NADH, 5 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 2.5 units of pyruvate kinase, and 4.5 μg of PanK. ATP concentrations were varied between 0.5 and 15 mm and pantothenate concentrations between 5 and 500 μm. Reactions were initiated by the addition of pantothenate. Inhibition Studies—Reaction mixtures for inhibition studies were identical to those described above except that the pantothenate (500 μm) and ATP (5.0 mm for BsCoaX, 10.0 mm for HpCoaX, and 1.5 mm for EcCoaA) concentrations were kept constant. Inhibitors (CoA, acetyl-CoA, or N-pentylpantothenamide (19Strauss E. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48205-48209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)) were added at concentrations between 10 and 500 μm, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of pantothenate. N-Pentylpantothenamide was also tested as a substrate for BsCoaX, HpCoaX, and SaCoaA. These reactions were performed as described above, but pantothenate was substituted with N-pentylpantothenamide and ATP concentrations remained constant at 10.0 mm for HpCoaX and BsCoaX and 1.5 mm for SaCoaA. Testing of Alternate Phosphoryl Donors—To determine whether other phosphate-containing compounds could substitute for ATP in the pantothenate kinase reaction catalyzed by BsCoaX and HpCoaX, reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 μg of enzyme, phosphate donor (1.5 mm concentration of either ATP, UTP, CTP, GTP, phosphoserine or phosphothreonine or 10 mm concentration of either acetylphosphate or carbamoylphosphate) and 500 μm pantothenate were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The reactions were placed at 95 °C for 5 min, centrifuged, and the supernatant of each sample applied to a column of Dowex 50WX8–100 resin. Columns were rinsed with deionized water and the solvent evaporated from the combined eluate. The dried samples were resuspended in 100 μl of 50% aqueous acetonitrile and analyzed by ESI-MS by direct infusion into the instrument at a rate of 20 μl/min. Expression and Purification of Type III PanKs—The putative CoaX proteins from B. subtilis (BsCoaX) and H. pylori (Hp-CoaX) were prepared by independently cloning the respective genes into overexpression vectors coding for N-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins. The vectors were transformed into E. coli BL21 Star(DE3) and the proteins overexpressed and purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Kinetic Characterization of Type III PanKs—The purified proteins were assayed for their ability to catalyze the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of pantothenate using a two enzyme-coupled assay that links the production of ADP to the oxidation of NADH. This allows the enzyme activity to be measured continuously by monitoring the change in A340. The assay was performed by varying the pantothenate concentration at a number of set ATP concentrations and determining the initial rates of reaction for each protein (Fig. 1). The results clearly show that both proteins have PanK activity. The initial rate data were used to determine the kinetic parameters of the enzymes by performing global non-linear fits using the most general form of the equation describing a bireactant mechanism (20Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 138-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The results are summarized in Table I, which also shows the kinetic parameters of the model prokaryotic Type I PanK EcCoaA (8Song W.J. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27051-27058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the eukaryotic Type II PanK from Aspergillus nidulans (AnPanK) (11Calder R.B. Williams R.S.B. Ramaswamy G. Rock C.O.

While the specificity constant for pantothenate varies very little among these enzymes (kcat/Km values not differing by more than a factor of 3), the CoaX enzymes exhibit a very low specificity for ATP. This is due to their surprisingly high Km values, which is nearly 10 mm in the case of HpCoaX. Such large Km values can be rationalized in the case of the BsCoaX enzyme that duplicates an activity already embodied by the more typical BsCoaA. However, since H. pylori depends exclusively on HpCoaX for its CoA biosynthetic needs, the question arises whether the low specificity constant for ATP of the enzyme determines the flux through the pathway. Further studies are currently under way to address this question.Table IKinetic parameters of the three characterized pantothenate kinase isoformsIsoformEnzymekcatSubstrateKmkcat/Kms-1μmmm-1·s-1Prokaryotic (Type I)EcCoaAaE. coli CoaA; apparent kinetic parameters taken from Ref. 8.0.30 ± 0.13Pantothenate36 ± 48.38 ± 3.69ATP136 ± 152.22 ± 0.98Eukaryotic (Type II)AnPanKbA. nidulans PanK; apparent kinetic parameters taken from Ref. 11.1.95Pantothenate6032.6ATP14513.5SaCoaAcS. aureus CoaA; apparent kinetic parameters taken from Ref. 12.1.73Pantothenate2375.21.56ATP3445.9CoaX-like (Type III)BsCoaX2.12 ± 0.17Pantothenate168 ± 2712.58 ± 2.27ATP3050 ± 5200.70 ± 0.13HpCoaX2.09 ± 0.26Pantothenate101 ± 2620.6 ± 5.9ATP9590 ± 21400.21 ± 0.05a E. coli CoaA; apparent kinetic parameters taken from Ref. 8Song W.J.

Open table in a new tab Testing the Efficacy of Alternate Phosphoryl Donors—To test whether the low specificity constant exhibited by the CoaX proteins for ATP was due to their preference for other phosphoryl donors, the enzymes were incubated with pantothenate and a range of activated and non-activated phosphate-containing substrates. These included GTP, CTP, UTP, PEP, and acetyl- and carbamoylphosphate. Phosphoserine and phosphothreonine were also tested, since they are known substrates of some phosphotransferase enzymes (21Singh S.K. Yang K. Karthikeyan S. Huynh T. Zhang X. Phillips M.A. Zhang H.

The reaction mixture with PEP was subsequently analyzed by the two enzyme-coupled assay, while the rest of the reaction mixtures were analyzed by ESI-MS for the presence of 4′-phosphopantothenate. The results were compared with mixtures containing ATP as well as to control reactions with EcCoaA. Only CTP and GTP could substitute for ATP in the case of HpCoaX, albeit to a lesser extent. No other phosphoryl donor was active in the reactions catalyzed by BsCoaX (data not shown). This strongly points to ATP as the cognate phosphoryl donor in the PanK reaction catalyzed by CoaX enzymes. Inhibition of Type III PanKs by CoA and Acetyl-CoA—With the exception of the recently characterized SaCoaA enzyme (12Leonardi R. Chohnan S. Zhang Y.M. Virga K.G. Lee R.E. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3314-3322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), all other known PanKs are inhibited by CoA or its thioesters, although the extent of inhibition is system-dependent (4Rock C.O.

In all cases the inhibition serves to regulate the intracellular CoA concentration by determining the flux through the pathway. To determine whether a similar effect can be observed with the CoaX enzymes reactions containing increasing amounts of CoA or acetyl-CoA were assayed for PanK activity (Fig. 2). The experiment was also performed with EcCoaA, which has a well described inhibition profile (9Vallari D.S. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2468-2471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), for comparison. Our results show that while EcCoaA demonstrates inhibition by CoA and to a lesser extent by acetyl-CoA as expected, neither of the CoaX enzymes are affected. This result is surprising, since the inhibition of PanK by CoA and its thioesters was until recently considered to constitute a common mechanism for the regulation of intracellular CoA levels in all organisms (12Leonardi R.

The fact that the SaCoaA enzyme is not subject to such regulation has been rationalized in terms of the unique physiology of this organism that depends on CoA and a NADPH-dependent CoA reductase to maintain the intracellular redox balance (23Luba J.

To test whether this was also the case with CoaX enzymes, N-pentylpantothenamide was substituted for pantothenate in reaction mixtures and the reactions assayed by the two enzyme-coupled system. No activity could be detected using concentrations of up to 0.5 mm (data not shown). To test whether the compound was an inhibitor of the enzyme, the activity of CoaX enzymes was assayed in the presence of increasing concentrations of N-pentylpantothenamide. No effect was observed (data not shown). It has been suggested (12Leonardi R. Chohnan S. Zhang Y.M. Virga K.G. Lee R.E. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3314-3322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) that the two enzyme-coupled system is not as sensitive as the radioactive-based assay employed in other studies as it reportedly failed to detect that N-pentylpantothenamide was a substrate for SaCoaA (13Choudhry A.E. Mandichak T.L. Broskey J.P. Egolf R.W. Kinsland C. Begley T.P. Seefeld M.A. Ku T.W. Brown J.R. Zalacain M. Ratnam K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 2051-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, in our hands we clearly detect activity when assaying SaCoaA in the presence of N-pentylpantothenamide by this method, suggesting that sensitivity is not a factor. Gene Cluster Analysis in Support of Functional Characterization—The conservation of gene clusters across genomes can often be applied to infer gene function (26Overbeek R. Fonstein M. D'Souza M. Pusch G.D. Maltsev N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2896-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). To apply this technique to CoaX enzymes the genes coding for these proteins were aligned across a set of genomes and the respective gene clusters analyzed for the presence of other CoA and pantothenate biosynthetic genes (Fig. 3). The results show that in Mycobacterium spp., Streptomyces coelicolor, Moorella thermoacetica, and F. tularensis genes encoding CoaX proteins are found associated with two genes involved in pantothenate biosynthesis (combinations of pantothenate synthetase, aspartate 1-decarboxylase, or ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase), while in Bdellovibrio the cluster contains these three pantothenate biosynthetic genes as well as the putative phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase/decarboxylase-encoding gene. Such clustering provides strong genetic support for the direct involvement of CoaX proteins in CoA biosynthesis. Multiple Sequence Alignment and Fold Prediction—An alignment of the sequences of CoaX enzymes from a diverse set of bacterial sources show that they share a set of conserved aspartate and glycine residues (see supplemental Fig. 1). These residues form part of distinct sequence motifs similar to those used in the classification of small molecule kinases, specifically those found in the ribonuclease H-like family of kinases (27Cheek S. Zhang H. Grishin N.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 855-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recent studies have found that Type II PanKs are also members of this kinase family, and preliminary data suggest that CoaX proteins are indeed members of the same group. 3K. Ginalski and N. V. Grishin, personal communication. This indicates that Type II and Type III PanKs share the same structural fold. However, Type I PanKs are structurally distinct and belong to the family of P-loop kinases. Conclusion—In this study we have cloned, overexpressed, and characterized two homologous proteins from B. subtilis and H. pylori and demonstrated that they have PanK activity. However, these proteins do not share sequence similarity with the other two known PanK isoforms. They also exhibit unique kinetic characteristics, showing low specificity constants for ATP and no regulation by CoA and its thioesters. These properties all distinguish them from the other PanK isoforms and strongly suggest that they are the first characterized examples of a third isoform of the PanK enzyme. Such Type III PanKs represent the enzyme in a variety of organisms in which no candidate PanK-encoding genes could be identified to date. It is still unclear what advantage, if any, these enzymes confer upon the mainly pathogenic organisms that harbor them. We extend our gratitude to Andrei Osterman for many helpful suggestions during the preparation of this manuscript, to Paul van Helden and Rob Warren (Department of Medical Biochemistry, Stellenbosch University) for a kind gift of H. pylori genomic DNA, and to Cynthia Kinsland (Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University) for a kind gift of the SaCoaA expression vector.

https://openalex.org/W2002605616,"Renal proximal tubular cell (RPTC) dedifferentiation is thought to be a prerequisite for regenerative proliferation and migration after renal injury. However, the specific mediators and the mechanisms that regulate RPTC dedifferentiation have not been elucidated. Because epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor activity is required for recovery from acute renal failure, we examined the role of the EGF receptor in dedifferentiation and the mechanisms of EGF receptor transactivation in primary cultures of RPTCs after oxidant injury. Exposure of confluent RPTCs to H2O2 resulted in 40% cell death, and surviving RPTCs acquired a dedifferentiated phenotype (e.g. elongated morphology and vimetin expression). The EGF receptor, p38, Src, and MKK3 were activated after oxidant injury and inhibition of the EGF receptor or p38 with specific inhibitors (AG1478 and SB203580, respectively) blocked RPTC dedifferentiation. Treatment with SB203580 or adenoviral overexpression of dominant negative p38α or its upstream activator, MKK3, inhibited EGF receptor phosphorylation induced by oxidant injury, whereas AG1478 had no effect on p38 phosphorylation. Inhibition of Src with 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]-pyrimidine (PP1) blocked MKK3 and p38 activation, and inhibition of MKK3 blocked p38 activation. In addition, inactivation of Src, MKK3, p38, or the EGF receptor blocked tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin, a key signaling intermediate that is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and vimentin expression. These results reveal that p38 mediates EGF receptor activation after oxidant injury; that Src activates MMK3, which, in turn, activates p38; and that the EGF receptor signaling pathway plays a critical role in RPTC dedifferentiation.

In many cases, kidneys subjected to an ischemic or toxic insult can completely recover. For example, surviving RPTCs 1The abbreviations used are: RPTC, renal proximal tubular cell; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; PP1, 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine; MOI, multiplicity of infection; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; pfu, plaque-forming unit(s); p-, phospho. are thought to be crucial for the restoration of renal function after acute renal failure. During the recovery process, surviving RPTCs convert to a dedifferentiated phenotype and then proliferate and migrate to replace lost cells (1Nony P.A. Schnellmann R.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 2Bonventre J.V. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: S55-S61Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, regenerating RPTCs differentiate and resume normal structure and functions. Because dedifferentiation of RPTCs is a prerequisite for migration and proliferation, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms of RPTC dedifferentiation. In turn, this information may contribute to the development of novel treatments that stimulate RPTC regeneration and decrease recovery time of acute renal failure. Dedifferentiation is a process by which differentiated cells reverse the normal developmental processes and become mesenchymal-like proliferating cells. Epithelial cells in the adult kidney are usually cuboidal in shape with a high degree of apical-basal polarity. In contrast, mesenchymal cells are elongated or stellate in shape and are characterized by expression of vimentin intermediate filaments (3Savagner P. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 912-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 4Hay E.D. Acta Anat. 1995; 154: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). In vivo studies demonstrated that in response to ischemia/reoxygenation injury, RPTCs express vimentin, which was detected within 1 day and absent by 16 days after ischemia/reperfusion injury (5Witzgall R. Brown D. Schwarz C. Bonventre J.V. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Concomitant with vimentin expression, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (a marker of proliferating cells) is positive in these cells (5Witzgall R. Brown D. Schwarz C. Bonventre J.V. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Thus, a dedifferentiation response occurs in surviving RPTCs after injury that is followed by proliferation and return of normal RPTC morphology and function. Because the regeneration process recapitulates the developmental paradigm in numerous ways, the mediators mediating both processes may be similar. For example, Devarajan et al. (6Devarajan P. Mishra J. Supavekin S. Patterson L.T. Steven Potter S. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 80: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) provided evidence that some genes that are known to play a key role during early renal morphogenesis also are induced within 3 h of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. p38 kinase is an important signaling molecule in kidney development. Its expression is predominantly distributed in mesenchymal cells and ureteric bud epithelia of the fetal kidney (7Awazu M. Omori S. Hida M. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2002; 9: 5-7Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 8Omori S. Hida M. Ishikura K. Kuramochi S. Awazu M. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 27-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and pharmacological inhibition of p38 in embryonic explants inhibits kidney growth (7Awazu M. Omori S. Hida M. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2002; 9: 5-7Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, an increase in p38 activity was associated with a switch to a mesenchymal-like cell phenotype in transforming growth factor β-stimulated renal epithelial cells (9Iijima K. Yoshizumi M. Hashimoto M. Akishita M. Kozaki K. Ako J. Watanabe T. Ohike Y. Son B. Yu J. Nakahara K. Ouchi Y. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2404-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). p38 kinases belong to the mitogen-activated protein kinase superfamily, which consists of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 (10Eckert R.L. Efimova T. Balasubramanian S. Crish J.F. Bone F. Dashti S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 823-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Currently, four different p38 isoforms (p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ) have been identified, and p38α and p38β are inhibited specifically by the pyridinyl imidazole SB203580 (11Pargellis C. Regan J. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2003; 4: 566-571PubMed Google Scholar). MKK3 and MKK6 are upstream activators of p38 kinases (12Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar). The EGF receptor is another important signaling molecule that mediates renal development and regeneration. It has been reported that both the number and tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptors increase in the kidney during late fetal development and tubulogenesis (13Cybulsky A.V. Goodyer P.R. McTavish A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F428-F436PubMed Google Scholar, 14Goodyer P.R. Fata J. Mulligan L. Fischer D. Fagan R. Guyda H.J. Goodyer C.G. Mol. Cell.

Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 774-781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and EGF receptor-blocking antibodies to metanephric cultures blocks differentiation of the ureteric bud (15Pugh J.L. Sweeney Jr., W.E. Avner E.D. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 774-781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, homozygous mice engineered with a targeted disruption of the EGF receptor exhibit abnormalities in the differentiation of structures derived from the ureteric bud (16Threadgill D.W. Dlugosz A.A. Hansen L.A. Tennenbaum T. Lichti U. Yee D. LaMantia C. Mourton T. Herrup K. Harris R.C. Barnard J.A. Yuspa S.H. Coffey R.J. Magnuson T. Science. 1995; 269: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). There is in vivo and in vitro evidence that the EGF receptor is an important regulator of RPTC regeneration after injury. It is up-regulated in rats and rabbits after ischemia/reperfusion injury and in humans with acute renal failure (17Safirstein R. Price P.M. Saggi S.J. Harris R.C. Kidney Int. 1990; 37: 1515-1521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 18Taira T. Yoshimura A. Iizuka K. Inui K. Oshiden K. Iwasaki S. Ideura T. Koshikawa S.

Activation of the EGF receptor with exogenous EGF promotes RPTC proliferation and migration (20Counts R.S. Nowak G. Wyatt R.D. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J.

The EGF receptor can be activated by different stimuli through diverse mechanisms. Ligands binding to the EGF receptor result in receptor dimerization, activation of tyrosine kinase domains, and autophosphorylation of the receptor (24Gschwind A. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Leserer M. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In addition, nonspecific stimuli such as osmotic stress, ultraviolet light, oxidative stress, and hypoxia/reoxygenation injury and G-protein-coupled receptor stimulation also trigger EGF receptor autophosphorylation (24Gschwind A. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Leserer M. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 25Cheng H. Kartenbeck J. Kabsch K. Mao X. Marques M. Alonso A. J. Cell.

Nephron. 1999; 81: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The activation of a cellular membrane receptor by a stimulus other than its ligand is termed receptor transactivation. Activation of the EGF receptor leads to phosphorylation of several tyrosine sites in the intracellular domain, which allows for specific binding of downstream signaling molecules and results in various cellular responses. As a member of cell to cell drop adherence junctions and the ability to link E-cadherin to the cytoskeleton, β-catenin plays an essential role in intercellular adhesion (9Iijima K. Yoshizumi M. Hashimoto M. Akishita M. Kozaki K. Ako J. Watanabe T. Ohike Y. Son B. Yu J. Nakahara K. Ouchi Y. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2404-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). β-Catenin has been identified as a signaling target of the EGF receptor (29Takahashi K. Suzuki K. Tsukatani Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and its activation is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (30Muller T. Bain G. Wang X. Papkoff J. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 280: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin leads to dissociation of the E-cadherin-β-catenin complex, nuclear translocation of β-catenin, and concomitant induction of TCF target genes (31Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). β-Catenin can drive the gene expression necessary for induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition such as Slug (32Savagner P. Yamada K.M. Thiery J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1403-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 33Conacci-Sorrell M. Simcha I. Ben-Yedidia T. Blechman J. Savagner P. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and the dedifferentiation marker, vimentin (34Gilles C. Polette M. Mestdagt M. Nawrocki-Raby B. Ruggeri P. Birembaut P. Foidart J.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2658-2664PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of epithelial cells to oxidants also leads to phosphorylation of β-catenin and disruption of epithelial cell-cell contacts and translocation of β-catenin into nucleus (35Rao R.K. Basuroy S. Rao V.U. Karnaky Jr., K.J. Gupta A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 36Price V.R. Reed C.A. Lieberthal W. Schwartz J.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1152-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which the EGF receptor is activated after injury and its role in RPTC dedifferentiation. Reagents—Human recombinant EGF was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). LY294002 and AG1478 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), respectively. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies to phospho-EGF receptor (Tyr1068), phospho-Akt, Akt, phospho-Src (Tyr416), Src, phospho-p38, p38, and phospho-ERK1/2 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies to ERK1/2 and EGF receptor were purchased from BD Laboratories (San Diego, CA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. All antibodies were used at 1:1000 for immunoblotting. Isolation and Culture of Renal Proximal Tubules—Female New Zealand White rabbits (2 kg) were purchased from Myrtle's Rabbitry (Thompson Station, TN). RPTCs were isolated using the iron oxide perfusion method and grown in 6-well or 35-mm tissue culture dishes under improved conditions as previously described (37Nowak G. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C2072-C2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The culture medium was a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (without glucose, phenol red, or sodium pyruvate) supplemented with 15 mm HEPES buffer, 2.5 mm l-glutamine, 1 μm pyridoxine HCl, 15 mm sodium bicarbonate, and 6 mm lactate. Hydrocortisone (50 nm), selenium (5 ng/ml), human transferrin (5 μg/ml), bovine insulin (10 nm), and l-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (50 μm) were added daily to fresh culture medium. Confluent RPTCs were used for all experiments. RPTC monolayers were pretreated with various inhibitors for 1 h and exposed to 1 mm H2O2 for different periods of time as indicated in the figure legends. For some experiments, RPTCs were treated with H2O2 for 5 h, washed twice with culture medium, and then incubated for an additional 24 h in the presence or absence of various inhibitors. All experiments were repeated at least three times, and representative results are illustrated in the figures. Replication-deficient Adenovirus Infection—Recombinant adenovirus expressing kinase inactive form of human p38 (Ad-p38αdn) and wild type (Ad-p38α) were propagated in HEK293 cells using standard methods. Transient transfections of HEK293 cells were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Viral titers were determined by plaque formation assay using HEK293 cells and expressed as plaque-forming units (pfu). RPTCs were infected with each virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 pfu for 2 h at 37°Cina humidified, 5% CO2 incubator. Afterward, the cultures were placed in normal culture media for an additional 48 h and then exposed to oxidant injury for the time periods described in the figure legends. At an MOI of 100 pfu, 100% of the cells showed expression of the viral gene insert as indicated by X-gal assay of RPTCs introduced with recombinant adenovirus expressing lacZ (data not shown). Preparation of Cell Lysates and Immunoblot Analysis—After treatment, RPTCs were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and harvested in lysis buffer (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol). Cells were disrupted by sonication for 15 s. Equal amounts of cellular protein lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After treatment with 5% skim milk at 4 °C overnight, membranes were incubated with various antibodies for 1 h and then incubated with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. Bound antibodies were visualized after chemiluminescence detection on autoradiographic film. Immunoprecipitation—RPTCs were washed and harvested in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Proteins (0.5 mg) were incubated with 10 μg of antibody for 1 h and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in sample buffer for 5 min, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to membranes. Immunoblot analysis was conducted as described above. Cellular Immunocytochemistry—RPTCs were fixed with 10% buffered formalin, washed, permeabilized, blocked with bovine serum albumin, and incubated with the primary antibody to the vimentin (Sigma) or a IgG control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). A fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody was added, and RPTCs were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. p38-mediated EGF Receptor Activation Is Required for RPTC Dedifferentiation—Dedifferentiation of epithelial cells is characterized by the conversion of epithelial cells to a fibroblast-like phenotype, the epithelial-mesenchyme transition (4Hay E.D. Acta Anat. 1995; 154: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of RPTC dedifferentiation, we determined whether the EGF receptor is required for formation of this phenotype after oxidant injury. Confluent RPTCs were exposed to H2O2 for 5 h and then incubated for 24 h in the absence or presence of AG1478, a specific inhibitor of the EGF receptor (38Partik G. Hochegger K. Schorkhuber M. Marian B. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 125: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After oxidant injury, ∼40% of the RPTCs died as indicated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (MTT) (data not shown). The remaining cells became elongated or stellate in shape, a feature of dedifferentiation (Fig. 1B). In the presence of AG1478, RPTCs retained the epithelial cell morphology (Fig. 1C). Previous in vivo and in vitro studies showed that vimentin, a filament protein that is expressed in mesenchymal cells but not in mature nephron epithelium, is detectable in RPTCs after ischemia/reperfusion (5Witzgall R. Brown D. Schwarz C. Bonventre J.V. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) and after toxicant injury in RPTCs (39Cummings B.S. Zangar R.C. Novak R.F. Lash L.H. Toxicology. 2000; 150: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined vimentin expression in RPTCs after oxidant injury in the presence or absence of AG1478. Whereas vimentin was not detected in confluent RPTCs by immunostaining using an anti-vimentin antibody (Fig. 1A), it was highly expressed in surviving RPTCs exhibiting a dedifferentiated morphology after oxidant injury (Fig. 1B). Treatment with AG1478 blocked the dedifferentiated morphology and vimentin expression (Fig. 1C). The morphological and vimentin expression data support the idea that RPTC dedifferentiation after oxidant injury is EGF receptor-dependent. Inhibition of the p38 Pathway, but Not the ERK1/2 Pathway, Blocks RPTC Dedifferentiation—Activation of p38 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways is implicated in the epithelial-mesenchyme transition in renal cells (40Bakin A.V.

Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C652-C661Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We determined whether the p38 and ERK1/2 pathways mediate RPTC dedifferentiation. RPTCs were exposed to H2O2 and then incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 (42Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar), or U0126, a specific inhibitor of ERK1/2 pathway (41Schramek H. Feifel E. Marschitz I. Golochtchapova N. Gstraunthaler G. Montesano R. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C652-C661Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Inhibition of p38, but not ERK1/2, blocked the dedifferentiated morphology and vimentin expression (Fig. 1, D and E). We suggest that p38, but not ERK1/2, mediates RPTC dedifferentiation after oxidant injury. H2O2 Induced Phosphorylation of the EGF Receptor and p38—Our previous studies showed that H2O2 induces EGF receptor activation, which is required for phosphorylation of ERK1/2, but not Akt in RPTCs (43Zhuang S. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: F858Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We examined p38 activation after H2O2 exposure and the relationship between p38 and EGF receptor activation. RPTCs were exposed to H2O2 in the presence or absence of AG1478, and the phosphorylation of each protein was determined using immunoblot analysis and antibodies that recognize the phosphorylated EGF receptor and p38. After H2O2 exposure, EGF receptor phosphorylation increased at 10 min, reached maximum levels at 30 min, and was persistent for at least 60 min (Fig. 2A). H2O2-induced p38 increased and was maximal in 5–10 min and returned to the basal level at 60 min. Although JNK kinases are also stress-responsive proteins, they were not activated in response to oxidant injury as assessed by immunoblot analysis and an anti-phosphorylated p54/46 JNK antibody (data not shown). AG1478 completely blocked H2O2-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation but did not affect p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). We suggest that p38 is activated after oxidant injury and that the EGF receptor is not responsible for p38 activation under this condition. p38 Activation Is Required for EGF Receptor Phosphorylation after H2O2 Exposure—To examine whether p38 is required for EGF receptor activation in response to oxidant injury, RPTCs were pretreated with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 and then exposed to H2O2. SB203580 blocked H2O2-induced EGF receptor and p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). In contrast, inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt or ERK1/2 pathway did not affect H2O2-induced phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (Fig. 3, B and C). We suggest that p38 is responsible for EGF receptor activation after oxidant injury. p38 Is Required for EGF Receptor Phosphorylation Induced by Osmotic Stress and UV Light, but Not EGF—p38 is activated by a number of other stimuli, including UV light and hyperosmotic shock (12Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar). These stresses also have been shown to stimulate activation of the EGF receptor (26Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 44Coffer P.J. Burgering B.M. Peppelenbosch M.P. Bos J.L. Kruijer W. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 561-569PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether p38 is responsible for EGF receptor activation by these stimuli, RPTCs were pretreated with SB203580 and then exposed to 1 mm NaCl and 500 J/m2 UV light. RPTCs treated with EGF were used as control. Inhibition of p38 blocked phosphorylation of the EGF receptor induced by NaCl or UV light (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, SB203580 had no effect on EGF receptor phosphorylation in EGF-treated RPTCs (Fig. 4C). These data are consistent with the above observations that p38 is specifically involved in EGF receptor activation induced by stress. Overexpression of p38αdn Inhibits EGF Receptor Phosphorylation after Oxidant Injury—To verify the role of p38 in H2O2-dependent EGF receptor activation, RPTCs were transfected with an adenovirus vector encoding a kinase-deficient human p38α mutant (Ad-p38αdn) (10Eckert R.L. Efimova T. Balasubramanian S. Crish J.F. Bone F. Dashti S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 823-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Adenovirus encoding LacZ was used as control. Ad-p38αdn transfection decreased H2O2-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation to 38% of RPTCs transfected with the same amount of adenovirus encoding LacZ (Fig. 5, A and B). Inhibition of p38 activation by the p38α mutant was confirmed using immunoblot analysis and an antibody against phospho-p38 (Fig. 5A). X-gal staining showed that 100% of RPTCs were infected by adenovirus using this protocol (data not shown). Inhibition of MKK3 Blocks p38 and EGF Receptor Phosphorylation Induced by Oxidant Injury—MKK3 functions as an upstream activator of p38. Therefore, we examined the effect of MKK3 inhibition on EGF receptor and p38 activation induced by H2O2. H2O2 induced phosphorylation of MKK3, similar to the time course of p38 activation (Figs. 2 and 6A). Transfection of RPTCs with an adenovirus vector encoding a kinase-deficient human MKK3 mutant (Ad-MKK3dn) resulted in complete inhibition of p38 and EGF receptor phosphorylation in H2O2-treated cells (Fig. 6B). Transfection of RPTCs with an adenovirus encoding LacZ did not have any effect on oxidant-induced p38 and EGF receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 6B). These data support a role for MKK3 in p38 activation in response to oxidant injury. p38 and MKK3 Act Downstream of Src in Mediating EGF Receptor Phosphorylation—Our previous studies indicated that Src mediates EGF receptor phosphorylation in response to H2O2 stimulation (43Zhuang S. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: F858Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To examine the relationship among p38, MKK3, and Src in EGF receptor phosphorylation after oxidant exposure, RPTCs were treated with diluent, the p38 inhibitor SB203580, or the Src inhibitor PP1 for 1 h and then exposed to H2O2. Cell lysates were analyzed for Src phosphorylation at tyrosine 416 because Src activity is regulated mainly by phosphorylation of different tyrosine sites with phosphorylation at tyrosine 416 in the catalytic domain as an activating signal (45Leu T.H. Maa M.C. Front. Biosci. 2003; 1: s28-s38Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). H2O2 stimulated Src tyrosine 416 phosphorylation, and inactivation of p38 had no effect on Src phosphorylation induced by H2O2 (Fig. 7A). However, inhibition of Src blocked p38 phosphorylation in H2O2-treated cells (Fig. 7B). Src inhibition also blocked MKK3 phosphorylation (Fig. 7C). These data illustrate that MKK3 and p38 are sequentially activated downstream of Src after oxidant injury. EGF Receptor Is Required for β-Catenin Activation after H2O2 Exposure—Loss of cell-cell adhesion has been postulated to be an important event for the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin is associated with this event (46Playford M.P. Bicknell D. Bodmer W.F. Macaulay V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12103-12108Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Experiments were designed to determine whether the EGF receptor mediates β-catenin activation after oxidant injury. RPTCs were treated with H2O2 in the presence and absence of the EGF receptor inhibitor AG1478, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-β-catenin antibody, and the resultant complex was immunoblotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20). H2O2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin, and β-catenin phosphorylation was blocked by AG1478 (Fig. 8). In summary, EGF receptor signaling is responsible for the activation of β-catenin after oxidant injury. p38, MMK3, and Src Mediate β-Catenin Activation after H2O2 Exposure—Because the above studies suggested that Src-mediated activation of p38 is coupled to EGF receptor phosphorylation after oxidant injury, we further examined whether p38, MMK3, and Src mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin. As shown in Fig. 9A, pretreatment of cells with SB203580 blocked β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, transfection of RPTCs with an adenovirus vector encoding a kinase-deficient human p38 or MKK3 mutant inhibited β-catenin phosphorylation in H2O2-treated cells (Fig. 9, B and C). Transfection of RPTCs with an adenovirus encoding LacZ did not have any effect on oxidant-induced β-catenin phosphorylation. In addition, inhibition of Src by PP1 blocked β-catenin phosphorylation in response to oxidant injury. These data are consistent with the role of the EGF receptor in mediating β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation and demonstrate that Src, MMK3, and p38 are in the same pathway and are required for this response after oxidant injury. Our studies have shown that the EGF receptor mediates RPTC proliferation and migration after mechanical injury, plating of renal proximal tubules (22Zhuang S. Dang Y. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 287: F365-F372Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and H2O2-induced EGF receptor activation (43Zhuang S. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: F858Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We suggested that the EGF receptor is critical for the regenerative response in renal epithelial cells and can be activated in response to oxidant injury. Because conversion of epithelia to the dedifferentiated phenotype is an early step in renal generation after injury, we examined the role of the EGF receptor in RPTC dedifferentiation after oxidant injury and the mechanisms of oxidant injury-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation. Our data revealed that after oxidant injury, surviving RPTCs acquired a dedifferentiated phenotype (e.g. elongated morphology and expression of vimentin) and that EGF receptor and p38 activation are required for RPTC dedifferentiation. Furthermore, oxidant injury activated p38, which, in turn, transactivated the EGF receptor. These are the first data that demonstrate that p38-mediated activation of the EGF receptor is essential for the regulation of RPTC dedifferentiation after oxidant injury. p38-mediated EGF receptor activation is specific to stress stimuli because activation of the EGF receptor with osmotic stress or UVC also required p38 activity, whereas EGF-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation did not. Whereas JNK is activated in response to oxidant stress in some systems, it is not activated by H2O2 in RPTCs as determined by immunoblot analysis and specific anti-phosphorylated antibodies (data not shown), suggesting that it may not be involved in the regulation of EGF receptor activation in this cell type. In addition, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and ERK pathways do not mediate EGF receptor phosphorylation, although these two pathways are activated in response to oxidant injury (43Zhuang S. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: F858Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) Our data also revealed that multiple isoforms of p38 may be involved in the transactivation of the EGF receptor after oxidant injury. p38α and p38β are ubiquitously expressed in tissues and are reported to be specifically inhibited by SB203580 (47Badger A.M. Bradbeer J.N. Votta B. Lee J.C. Adams J.L. Griswold D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 1453-1461PubMed Google Scholar). However, treatment with this inhibitor did not abolish EGF receptor phosphorylation after oxidant injury. In contrast, overexpression of dominant negative mutants of MKK3 resulted in complete inhibition of this event. Given that MKK3 is an upstream activator of p38α, p38δ, and p38γ, but not p38β (48Strniskova M. Barancik M. Ravingerova T. Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 2002; 21: 231-255PubMed Google Scholar), and that p38γ is not expressed in kidney (49Li Z. Jiang Y. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), we postulate that p38α and p38δ may be the two major isoforms involved in regulating EGF receptor activation under this condition. In support of this hypothesis, overexpression of dominant negative of p38α completely blocked p38 phosphorylation but only partially inhibited EGF receptor phosphorylation induced by oxidant injury. The specific role of p38δ in regulating EGF receptor activation needs further investigation. The mechanism underlying p38 activation of the EGF receptor remains unclear. It has been proposed that ligand-dependent and -independent mechanisms are involved in the transactivation of the EGF receptor (50Fischer O.M. Hart S. Gschwind A. Ullrich A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1203-1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand-independent activation of the EGF receptor appears to be mediated by multiple intracellular signaling molecules including Src. Src is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase (30Muller T. Bain G. Wang X. Papkoff J. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 280: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 45Leu T.H. Maa M.C. Front. Biosci. 2003; 1: s28-s38Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and has been reported to directly activate the EGF receptor by phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at tyrosine residue 845 (51Sato K. Nagao T. Iwasaki T. Nishihira Y. Fukami Y. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this regard, our previous studies have shown that EGF receptor activation (phosphorylation of Tyr1068 and Tyr845) after oxidant stress requires Src activation (43Zhuang S. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: F858Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, our data show that p38 acts downstream of Src in mediating EGF receptor activation in oxidant-treated RPTCs. An alternative mechanism for EGF receptor activation by p38 may involve metalloprotease-dependent EGF receptor ligand production from membrane-bound precursors. Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, epiregulin, and transforming growth factor α can activate the EGF receptor (52Kalmes A. Vesti B.R. Daum G. Abraham J.A. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 53Schafer B. Gschwind A. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 54Lui V.W. Thomas S.M.

Kitabatake A. Ogawa A. Nishida W. Yano M. Monden M. Sobue K. Circulation. 2003; 108: 2524-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These EGF receptor ligands are synthesized as transmembrane proteins (proforms) and cleaved to yield soluble forms, thereby binding to the EGF receptor and leading to EGF receptor activation. Ectodomain shedding, the proteolytic processing of the extracellular domain of these transmembrane proteins to form soluble factors, is mediated by metalloproteases (56Eguchi S. Frank G.D. Mifune M. Inagami T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1198-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p38 has been reported to mediate expression and activation of a number of metalloproteases necessary for cleavage of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor and transforming growth factor α such as matrix metalloprotease-9 and tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme (57Simon C. Goepfert H. Boyd D. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1135-1139PubMed Google Scholar, 58Li X. Fan H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27365-27375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 59Fischer O.M. Hart S. Gschwind A. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5172-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor has been identified in RPTCs and implicated in EGF receptor activation in vascular smooth muscle cells in response to oxidant stress (60Frank G.D. Mifune M. Inagami T. Ohba M. Sasaki T. Higashiyama S. Dempsey P.J. Eguchi S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Whereas these observations raise the possibility that heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor cleavage is involved in p38-mediated EGF receptor activation in RPTCs after oxidant injury, our previous studies showed that blocking matrix metalloprotease had no effect on EGF receptor activation after a 10-min exposure of RPTCs to H2O2 (43Zhuang S. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: F858Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Takahashi et al. (29Takahashi K. Suzuki K. Tsukatani Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) reported that the EGF receptor bound to β-catenin and induced tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin in normal human breast epithelial cells in response to ligand stimulation. Our data revealed that EGF receptor activity is required for tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin after oxidant exposure. Consistent with the observation that EGF receptor activation is transactivated by a p38-dependent mechanism, H2O2-induced β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation also was inhibited by inactivation of the upstream activators of the EGF receptor p38, MKK3, and Src. Phosphorylation of β-catenin induces the release of β-catenin from the E-cadherin complex, increasing the free cytoplasmic pool of β-catenin and the subsequent relocation of β-catenin to the nucleus (46Playford M.P. Bicknell D. Bodmer W.F. Macaulay V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12103-12108Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 61Hazan R.B. Norton L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9078-9084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Nuclear β-catenin has been associated with enhanced transcription of target genes that are involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (30Muller T. Bain G. Wang X. Papkoff J. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 280: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 62Kim K. Lu Z. Hay E.D. Cell Biol. Int. 2002; 26: 463-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Activation of the EGF receptor induces cell scattering and a fibroblast-like morphology associated with β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation (30Muller T. Bain G. Wang X. Papkoff J. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 280: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 63Shibamoto S. Hayakawa M. Takeuchi K. Hori T. Oku N. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Takeichi M. Ito F. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 1: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Consequently, p38-mediated EGF activation may regulate RPTC vimentin expression and dedifferentiation via a mechanism involving tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin. In support of this idea, a recent study suggested that β-catenin transcriptional activity is required for vimentin expression (34Gilles C. Polette M. Mestdagt M. Nawrocki-Raby B. Ruggeri P. Birembaut P. Foidart J.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2658-2664PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, our study demonstrates that after oxidant injury, p38 is activated, which in turn stimulates activation of the EGF receptor and tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin in RPTCs. Furthermore, p38 is activated by the sequential activation of Src and MKK3. We also provide evidence that p38-mediated EGF receptor transactivation is required for RPTC dedifferentiation. These data, together with the importance of the EGF receptor in mediating RPTC proliferation and migration in vitro and in renal functional recovery after injury in an animal model, suggest that EGF receptor transactivation may be a key molecular event that initiates regenerative responses after renal injury."
https://openalex.org/W2012477840,"Meiotic cohesin serves in sister chromatid linkage and DNA repair until its subunit Rec8 is cleaved by separase. Separase is activated when its inhibitor, securin, is polyubiquitinated by the Cdc20 regulated anaphase-promoting complex (APCCdc20) and consequently degraded. Differently regulated APCs (APCCdh1, APCAma1) have not been implicated in securin degradation at meiosis I. We show that Mnd2, a factor known to associate with APC components, prevents premature securin degradation in meiosis by APCAma1. mnd2Δ cells lack linear chromosome axes and exhibit precocious sister chromatid separation, but deletion of AMA1 suppresses these defects. Besides securin, Sgo1, a protein essential for protection of centromeric cohesion during anaphase I, is also destabilized in mnd2Δ cells. Mnd2’s disappearance prior to anaphase II may activate APCAma1. Human oocytes may spend many years in meiotic prophase before maturation. Inhibitors of meiotic APC variants could prevent loss of chiasmata also in these cells, thereby guarding against aberrant chromosome segregation."
https://openalex.org/W1970677041,"One of the most efficient systems of acid resistance in Escherichia coli, the gad system, is based on the coordinated action of two isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase (GadA and GadB) and of a specific glutamate/γ-aminobutyrate antiporter (GadC). The gadA/BC genes, activated in response to acid stress and in stationary phase cells, are subjected to complex circuits of regulation involving σ70, σS, cAMP receptor protein, H-NS, EvgAS, TorRS, GadE, GadX, GadW, and YdeO. Herein, we provide evidence that the nucleoid-associated protein H-NS directly functions as repressor of gadA, one of the structural genes, and gadX, a regulatory gene encoding one of the primary activators of the gad system. Band shift and DNase I footprints reveal that H-NS indeed binds to specific sites in the promoter regions of gadA and gadX and represses the transcription of these genes both in an in vitro system and in vivo. Moreover, we show that a maltose-binding protein MalE-GadX fusion is able to stimulate the promoter activity of gadA/BC, thus indicating that GadX is by itself able to up-regulate the gad genes and that a functional competition between H-NS and GadX takes place at the gadA promoter. Altogether, our results indicate that H-NS directly inhibits gadA and gadX transcription and, by controlling the intracellular level of the activator GadX, indirectly affects the expression of the whole gad system.

Colonization of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract by enteric bacteria requires the induction of genes, the protein products of which participate, either as regulators or as structural components, in survival mechanisms aimed at counteracting the life-threatening consequences of internal pH acidification (1Foster J.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 2Foster J.W. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 3Merrell D.S. Camilli A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli have evolved three systems of acid resistance (4Lin J. Lee I.S. Frey J. Slonczewski J.L.

Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3094-3100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the most effective of these is dependent on glutamate and comprises at least the genes gadA and gadB, encoding two isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase, and gadC, encoding a glutamate/γ-aminobutyrate antiporter (6Castanie-Cornet M.P. Penfound T.A. Smith D. Elliott J.F. Foster J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3525-3535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7De Biase D. Tramonti A. Bossa F. Visca P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1198-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The enzyme glutamate decarboxylase incorporates protons during production of γ-aminobutyrate, which is then exported by the antiporter GadC in exchange for new substrate. The net effect is that protons leaking into the cell during acid stress are consumed and released by this system, thus contributing to pH homeostasis also in terms of restoring the negative-internal electrical potential (2Foster J.W. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar).The structural gadA/BC genes are subjected to a complex regulatory network involving the following proteins: the vegetative and stationary phase σ factors, σ70 and σS, the cAMP receptor protein (CRP), 1The abbreviations used are: CRP, cAMP receptor protein; MalE, maltose-binding protein.1The abbreviations used are: CRP, cAMP receptor protein; MalE, maltose-binding protein. the histone-like protein H-NS, the EvgAS and TorRS two-component systems, the TrmE GTPase, the AraC-like regulators GadX, GadW, and YdeO, and the LuxR-family regulator GadE (Ref. 2Foster J.W. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar and references therein). The degree of involvement of each regulator varies depending upon growth medium composition and phase of growth, thus adding a further level of complexity to the regulation of the gad system. Transcriptional analyses have demonstrated that the gadB and gadC genes are cotranscribed as a gadBC dicistronic mRNA from the gadB promoter (7De Biase D. Tramonti A. Bossa F. Visca P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1198-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), gadA is cotranscribed with gadX as a dicistronic gadAX mRNA (8Tramonti A. Visca P. De Canio M. Falconi M. De Biase D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 10: 2603-2613Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and gadX can also be cotranscribed with gadW (9Tucker D.L. Tucker N. Ma Z. Foster J.W. Miranda R.L. Cohen P.S. Conway T. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3190-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, gadA and gadX can be synthesized as monocistronic transcripts starting from their own promoters (8Tramonti A. Visca P. De Canio M. Falconi M. De Biase D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 10: 2603-2613Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Two main activation circuits were identified, a σS-dependent circuit and a σS-independent circuit. Within the σS-dependent circuit during the stationary phase of growth, either in rich or in minimal medium, the increase in gadA and gadBC transcription requires GadX, which directly binds the gadA and gadB regulatory regions and, under some circumstances, acts in combination with GadW (8Tramonti A.

Bacteriol. 2002; 10: 2603-2613Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar) partially explains the involvement of CRP and H-NS in the regulation of the gad genes. In fact, this alternative σ factor is known to be repressed by CRP at the transcriptional level and by H-NS at the post-transcriptional level (12Ma Z. Richard H. Tucker D.L. Conway T. Foster J.W. J.

Different is the scenario when the expression of the gad system is analyzed at acidic pH in exponentially growing cells in minimal glucose medium (σS-independent circuit). Under these growth conditions, the GadE activator is primarily implicated in gadA and gadBC transcription (its overexpression causes GAD production even in cells lacking both GadX and GadW regulators), and gadE itself turns out to be acid-induced (14Ma Z. Gong S. Richard H. Tucker D.L. Conway T. Foster J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 15Hommais F. Krin E. Coppee J.Y. Lacroix C. Yeramian E. Danchin A. Bertin P. Microbiology (Reading). 2004; 150: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A cascade reaction model, in which EvgA stimulates gadE expression directly and indirectly via ydeO, was proposed to explain the induction of GadE during acid challenge (16Ma Z. Masuda N. Foster J.W.

Since mutations in hns are highly pleiotropic and there have been no attempts to systematically identify the target genes of the H-NS-mediated repression, so far, a direct role of this histone-like protein on the regulation of the gad system can only be hypothesized. The DNA-binding protein H-NS, one of the major components of bacterial chromatin, is recognized as a global regulator of bacterial cell physiology, being involved in the modulation, primarily at transcriptional level, of a fairly large number of genes. Most of the genes belonging to the H-NS regulon are linked to the stress response or to changes in the environmental conditions such as temperature, osmolarity, growth phase, pH, and availability of oxygen and nutrients (10Hommais F.

The structural basis for H-NS function as a gene silencer seems to reside in its preferential binding to AT-rich curved DNA sequences, often found upstream of E. coli promoters (21Yamada H.

In the present work, such a kind of analysis focused on the global regulator H-NS and on the specific activator GadX. Here, we demonstrate that H-NS plays a negative role on the regulation of the gad system, identifying gadA and gadX as the target genes of such repression. We show that H-NS, indeed, directly inhibits the transcription of gadA and gadX through a selective interaction with two binding sites in the promoter regions of these genes. We also found that the fusion protein MalE-GadX is able both to stimulate in vitro the transcription of gadA and gadBC genes and to antagonize in a dose-dependent manner the repressive activity of H-NS at the level of the gadA promoter.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmid Constructions, and General Procedures— E. coli strains used in this study were two derivatives of MC1029 denoted HMG11 (wild type) and HMG9 (hns-) (28Goransson M. Sondén B. Nilsson P. Dagberg B. Forsman K. Emanuelsson K. Uhlin B.E. Nature. 1990; 344: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Cells, harboring pKK232.8 constructs, were grown at 37 °C in LB broth supplemented with ampicillin 50 μg/ml. Total RNA extraction and Northern blots were performed as described previously (29Brandi A. Spurio R. Gualerzi C.O. Pon C.L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Purification of H-NS was performed as described (30Falconi M. Gualtieri M.T. La Teana A. Losso M.A. Pon C.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The MalE-GadX fusion protein was purified as described previously (31Tramonti A. De Canio M. Bossa F. De Biase D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1647: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) by a combination of two chromatography steps on an amylose resin and heparin-agarose resin. Computer-generated predictions of DNA curvature were obtained with D.I.C.E. (DNA Intrinsic Curvature Evaluator), a program developed by G. Micheli (32Prosseda G. Falconi M. Giangrossi M. Gualerzi C.O. Micheli G. Colonna B. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).The gadA fragments spanning from -69 to +77 and from -179 to +77, relative to the transcription start site, were extracted by EcoRI-BamHI digestion from the corresponding promoter probe pRS constructs (7De Biase D. Tramonti A. Bossa F. Visca P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1198-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Fragments were filled in to allow blunt-end cloning into the SmaI site of pKK232.8 vector, thus generating plasmids pKgadA-69 and pKgadA-179. The gadB fragment spanning from -244 to +77, relative to the transcription start site, was amplified by PCR using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs), pBsB (33De Biase D. Tramonti A. John R.A. Bossa F. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) as template, and two specific 21- and 27-base-long primers designed to allow directional cloning at the BamHI and HindIII sites of pKK232.8. The amplicon obtained after 25 PCR cycles (95 °C for 1 min, 49 °C for 1 min, and 74 °C for 1 min) was subcloned in pBs, sequenced on both strands, and then transferred into the corresponding sites of pKK232.8, generating the pKgadB-244 construct. Plasmids pKgadX-67 and pKgadX-222 were generated by subcloning the gadX fragments spanning from -67 and -222 to +121, relative to the transcription start site, from the corresponding promoter probe constructs in pRS (8Tramonti A. Visca P. De Canio M. Falconi M. De Biase D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 10: 2603-2613Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar) into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pBs. Fragments were then excised with EcoRV and BamHI restriction enzymes and transferred in pKK232.8 digested with SmaI and BamHI.Band Shift Assay—Each reaction mixture contained ∼5 ng of PCR-generated DNA fragments (end-labeled with [32P]dATP by fill-in reaction using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I), 50 ng of poly(dI-dC) as DNA competitor, and the indicated concentrations of purified H-NS in a total volume of 15 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. After 10 min of incubation at 25 °C, the DNA-protein complexes were analyzed by 7% PAGE under native conditions in TAE buffer, pH 7.4 (40 mm Tris, 5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA). The two gadA DNA fragments of 154 and 256 bp were generated by PCR amplification using as template the pKgadA-179 DNA, using as forward primers AB69 (from -69 to -53, 5′-GGGAATTCGGATTTTGTTATTTAAA-3′) and A179 (from -179 to -158, 5′-GGGAATTCATCGCCCGAACAGGAATG-3′), respectively, and using AB77 (from +77 to +61, 5′-GGGGATCCCGTGAATCGAGTAGTTC-3′) as reverse primer. The two gadX DNA fragments of 198 and 352 bp were generated by PCR amplification using as template the pKgadX-222 DNA, using as forward primers X67B (from -70 to -45, 5′-CGCGGATCCCGCTTCGTTAAAATTTATTTATC-3′) and X222B (from -222 to -197, 5′-CGGGATCCGATATATGTTATATGAATGTTTATTC-3′), respectively, and using X121H (from +121 to +99, 5′-CCCAAGCTTGCCATTAAAATAGCGATATTCACC-3′) as reverse primer.In Vitro Transcription—In vitro transcription from supercoiled pKK232.8 derivatives as templates (200 ng) was carried out at 37 °C in the presence of increasing amounts of the indicated purified protein. Each reaction mixture (40 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm each of NTPs, and 2 units of ribonuclease inhibitor. After preincubating the samples for 20 min, 0.3 units of σ-saturated E. coli RNA polymerase (United States Biochemical) were added, and the incubation was prolonged for an additional 30 min. The reaction was stopped on ice, and RNA was precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 1 μg of tRNA as carrier. The gad::cat transcripts were detected by Northern analysis using as probe a 32P-labeled cat gene essentially as described previously (37Falconi M. Higgins N.P. Spurio R. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The radioactivity present on the filter was quantified by Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad model GS-250).DNase I Footprinting—Supercoiled plasmid DNA (200 ng/sample) was preincubated 20 min at 25 °C with the indicated concentrations of purified H-NS in 30 μl of binding buffer (40 mm Hepes-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). After the addition of 1 unit of DNase I, incubation was continued for 40 s, and the reactions were stopped by placing the samples on ice and by the addition of 8 μl of EDTA 250 mm and 5 μl of sodium acetate (3 m). Each DNA sample (∼50 μl), precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol in the presence of 1 μg of tRNA carrier, was resuspended in 10 μl of Polymed PCR buffer supplemented with 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm each dNTP, 4 pmol of the 5′-32P end-labeled primer, and 0.5 units of Taq polymerase (Polymed) and subjected to 30 cycles of linear PCR (denaturation, 30 s at 95 °C; annealing, 30 s at temperatures between 40 and 50 °C depending on the primer; extension, 30 s at 72 °C). The extension products were separated on 7% sequencing gel. The oligonucleotides A179 (see above) and AB77 (see above) were used to detect H-NS protections at both the gadA non-coding and the gadA coding strand, respectively. The oligonucleotides X771 (from -222 to -197, 5′-GATATATGTTATATGAATGTTTATTC-3′) and X772 (from +58 to +39, 5′-ATTAGACAATTCCCATGTAG-3′) were used to detect H-NS protections at both gadX non-template and template strand, respectively.Construction of Single-copy gadA and gadB::lacZ Transcriptional Fusions and β-Galactosidase Assay—The gadB fragment spanning from -244 to +77, relative to the transcription start site, was excised from the plasmid pKKgadB-244 with BamHI and HindIII restriction enzymes, filled in, and cloned into the SmaI site of pRS415 (34Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). The transcriptional fusions of gadA-179/+77 (7De Biase D. Tramonti A. Bossa F. Visca P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1198-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and gadB-244/+77, cloned into the vector pRS415, were transferred to phage vectors λRS45 by in vivo homologous recombination in E. coli MC4100, according to standard protocol (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Lysogens were obtained by infecting the E. coli strains MC4100 carrying the empty plasmid pBs or pBsX (8Tramonti A. Visca P. De Canio M. Falconi M. De Biase D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 10: 2603-2613Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar) with the recombinant fusion phages as described (34Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured according to Miller (36Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) and expressed as follows: 1000 × (A420 - 1.75 × A550)/(A600 culture × reaction time × volume).RESULTSH-NS Specifically Interacts with the Promoter Region of gadA and gadX Genes—Although many authors have shown that gadA and gadBC genes are derepressed in an hns genetic background during the exponential growth in neutral medium, a condition in which these genes are normally silenced (7De Biase D. Tramonti A. Bossa F. Visca P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1198-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 10Hommais F. Krin E. Laurent-Winter C. Soutourina O. Malpertuy A. LeCaer J.P. Danchin A. Bertin P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 20-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 18Yoshida T. Yamashino T. Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1993; 57: 1568-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), so far, no evidence has been provided that H-NS is directly involved in repressing transcription of gadA, gadBC, and other genes belonging to the gad system. To determine whether H-NS interacts with one (or more) gad gene(s), we have screened by band shift assays the promoter regions of the two structural genes gadA and gadBC and of the regulatory gene gadX. As shown in Fig. 1, H-NS is able to specifically interact with different DNA fragments encompassing the promoter regions of gadA (Fig. 1A) and gadX (Fig. 1B). Under the same experimental conditions, very weak or no interaction of H-NS was detected with the DNA fragment of the gadBC promoter spanning the nucleotide region -307/+77 relative to the gadB transcriptional start point (data not shown). Thus, H-NS shifts the gadA (-69/+77) and gadX (-67/+121) DNA fragments encompassing the corresponding promoter regions as well as the gadA (-179/+77) and gadX (-222/+121) fragments carrying an additional region upstream the promoter elements, albeit with different affinities. In fact, although shifts of the smaller fragments are observed only with the highest amounts of H-NS tested (1.6–2 μm), less protein (0.8–1.2 μm) is required to retard the longer DNA fragments. These results indicate that H-NS binds the longer fragments, carrying the entire regulatory region, of gadA and gadX with an affinity that is ∼2-fold greater than that displayed for the shorter ones, which only contain the minimum promoter. Furthermore, the nature of the interaction of H-NS with PgadA and PgadX is different depending on the length of the promoter region tested (Fig. 1). In fact, H-NS can give rise to two types of retardation patterns producing a high and low mobility complex, named CI and CII, respectively. A unique nucleoprotein complex (CI) is formed with the shorter DNA fragments, carrying the proximal-promoter region of gadA (-69/+77) and gadX (-67/+121), indicating the presence of a single H-NS binding site. A further complex (CII), presumably resulting from the occupancy by H-NS of an additional binding site, appeared only with the longer gadA (-179/+77) and gadX (-222/+121) fragments.To deeply characterize the nature of CI and CII complexes, the interaction of H-NS with the regulatory regions of gadA and gadX was analyzed by DNase I footprinting experiments. According to results of electrophoretic gel shift experiments, two H-NS binding sites, numbered I and II, have been identified both on gadA and on gadX regulatory regions (Fig. 2, A–D). H-NS protections show an average length of about 60 bp and, within the limit of accuracy of this analysis, are reasonably well matching on both DNA strands. H-NS protections on gadA span from +22 to -50 on template strand and from +43 to -55 on non-template strand (site I), and from -89 to -133 on template strand and from -86 to -120 on non-template strand (site II). H-NS protections on gadX span from -10 to -67 on template strand and from +1 to -59 on non-template strand (site I), and from -88 to -153 on template strand and from -86 to -134 on non-template strand (site II). The location of H-NS binding sites on gadA and gadX promoters regions is summarized in Fig. 3.Fig. 2Identification of H-NS binding sites on gadA and gadX promoters by DNase I footprints. Plasmid pKgadA-179 (A and B) and pKgadX-222 (C and D) were incubated at ∼25 °C with or without the indicated amounts of H-NS, and the samples were processed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using the oligonucleotides A179 (A), AB77 (B), X771 (C), and X772 (D) as primers. Lanes G and A represent the Taq polymerase sequencing reactions using the same primers. The H-NS-protected sites are indicated with vertical lines and labeled I and II.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3H-NS binding sites within gadA and gadX regulatory regions. The H-NS binding sites within the nucleotide sequence of gadA (from -183 to +97) and gadX (from -228 to +121), as determined by DNase I footprinting, are indicated by dotted lines. The bold letters indicate a translational initiation triplet, a hypothetical ribosome binding site sequence, transcriptional start sites, and -10 and -35 promoter consensus sequences. The horizontal arrows, marked by a number, identify the boundaries of the DNA region carried by pKgadA-69 (1 and 3), pKgadA-179 (2 and 3), pKgadX-67 (4 and 6), and pKgadX-222 (5 and 6). Underlined sequences are the GadX binding sites on the gadA regulatory region (8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The average size of sites (∼60 bp) and the finding that H-NS has a similar affinity for all four sites (as shown in Fig. 2, A–D, a remarkable protection is obtained within the range of 0.3–0.4 μm of protein) suggest that both sites, either on gadA or on gadX, might be occupied simultaneously and somewhat cooperatively by several H-NS molecules. Thus, the two sites may be not entirely independent of each other, and the existence of long range protein-protein interactions among H-NS molecules bound to sites I and II can be rationally supposed. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that H-NS, upon interaction with one site, efficiently binds to the other site so that in the presence of the entire regulatory region of gadA and gadX, the predominant complex formed is CII (Fig. 1).Computer-generated prediction of DNA curvature reveals that regulatory regions of gadA, gadBC, and gadX are not endowed with an intrinsic bending, often found in H-NS-responsive promoters (data not shown). The H-NS binding model observed for gadA and gadX for many aspects (i.e. binding sites location, reciprocal influence between different sites, long range protein-protein interactions) resembles those proposed for the regulation of other genetic systems characterized at the molecular level, such as hns, proU, rrnB, and virF (32Prosseda G.

In yeast such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, however, the first and last enzymes of the pathway, galactose mutarotase and UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, are contained within a single polypeptide chain referred to as Gal10p. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of Gal10p in complex with NAD+, UDP-glucose, and β-d-galactose determined to 1.85-Å resolution. The enzyme is dimeric with dimensions of ∼91 Å × 135 Å × 108 Å and assumes an almost V-shaped appearance. The overall architecture of the individual subunits can be described in terms of two separate N- and C-terminal domains connected by a Type II turn formed by Leu-357 to Val-360. The first 356 residues of Gal10p fold into the classical bilobal topology observed for all other UDP-galactose 4-epimerases studied thus far. This N-terminal domain contains the binding sites for NAD+ and UDP-glucose. The polypeptide chain extending from Glu-361 to Ser-699 adopts a β-sandwich motif and harbors the binding site for β-d-galactose. The two active sites of Gal10p are separated by over 50 Å.

This investigation represents the first structural analysis of a dual function enzyme in the Leloir pathway. β-d-Galactose is converted to the more metabolically useful glucose 1-phosphate by the action of four enzymes that constitute the Leloir pathway as shown in Scheme 1 (reviewed in Ref. 1Holden H.M. Rayment I. Thoden J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43885-43888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Mutations in the genes that encode for three of these enzymes in humans, specifically galactokinase, galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, and UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, result in the diseased state referred to collectively as galactosemia (2Segal S.

The clinical severity of these disorders varies widely, depending upon the gene affected and the resulting degree of enzyme impairment. Common symptoms include cataract formation, impaired cognitive development, and liver dysfunction among others. In the first step of the Leloir pathway, β-d-galactose is converted to α-d-galactose by galactose mutarotase. The structures of the mutarotases from both Lactococcus lactis and human have been solved and shown to adopt a distinctive β-sandwich motif (5Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20854-20861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 6Thoden J.B. Kim J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 23431-23437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). From a combined structural and functional analysis of the enzyme from L. lactis, it has been postulated that a conserved glutamate residue serves as the active site base to abstract the sugar C-1 hydroxyl hydrogen and that a conserved histidine functions as the active site acid to protonate the C-5 ring oxygen, thereby leading to ring opening (8Thoden J.B. Kim J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1051-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Subsequent rotation about the C-1–C-2 bond by 180° followed by abstraction of the proton on the C-5 oxygen by the histidine and donation of a proton by the glutamic acid back to the C-1 oxygen leads to product formation. During the second step of the pathway, α-d-galactose is phosphorylated to galactose-1-phosphate by the action of galactokinase. The three-dimensional structures of the galactokinases from L. lactis, Pyrococcus furiosus, and human have been shown to adopt a bilobal motif with the active site wedged between the N- and C-terminal domains (9Thoden J.B.

Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2471-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the case of the human enzyme, the structure was solved in the presence of α-d-galactose and the non-hydrolyzable analog AMPPNP. 1The abbreviation used is: AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. Examination of the active site geometry with these bound ligands suggests that two conserved residues, Arg-37 and Asp-186, may play key roles in the reaction mechanism (11Thoden J.B. Timson D.J. Reece R.J. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9662-9670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The actual mode of catalysis, however, is still not completely defined for the galactokinases. The third enzyme required for normal galactose metabolism is galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, which catalyzes the reversible transfer of a UMP moiety from UDP-glucose to galactose 1-phosphate thus yielding glucose 1-phosphate and UDP-galactose. In the case of the uridylyltransferase, the reaction proceeds through a double displacement mechanism whereby a histidine residue is transiently modified (13Kim J. Ruzicka F. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10590-10593Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Wedekind J.E. Frey P.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11560-11569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Detailed structural analyses of the dimeric protein from Escherichia coli have revealed that each subunit displays a “half-barrel” motif and that His-166 is the active site base (15Wedekind J.E. Frey P.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11049-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Thoden J.B. Ruzicka F.J. Frey P.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1212-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For the pathway to be completed, UDP-galactose is converted back to UDP-glucose by UDP-galactose 4-epimerase. Over the years this enzyme has attracted significant research attention because of its interesting catalytic mechanism, including: 1) abstraction of the sugar 4′-hydroxyl hydrogen by an enzymatic base and hydride transfer from the C-4 of the sugar to the si-face of the nicotinamide ring of a tightly bound NAD+ cofactor, 2) rotation of the resulting 4′-ketopyranose intermediate in the active site to present the opposite face of the sugar to the reduced dinucleotide, and 3) transfer of the hydride from the nicotinamide ring of NADH back to the C-4 of the sugar and reprotonation of the C-4 oxygen. The structures of the enzymes from both E. coli and human have been extensively studied (reviewed in Ref. 1Holden H.M. Rayment I. Thoden J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43885-43888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). From these investigations, it is now known that the epimerase belongs to the so-called short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily (17Duax W.L. Ghosh D. Pletnev V. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 58: 121-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that a conserved tyrosine residue functions as the active site base (18Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The enzymes of the Leloir pathway are widespread in nature and have been isolated from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In most organisms, the four activities exist on separate polypeptide chains. Curiously, however, in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces fragilis, the first and last enzymes of the pathway, namely the mutarotase and the epimerase, are contained on single polypeptide chains that associate to form homodimers (19Brahma A. Bhattacharyya D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Majumdar S. Ghatak J. Mukherji S. Bhattacharjee H. Bhaduri A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Indeed, enzymatic assays have clearly demonstrated the existence of both mutarotase and epimerase activities on the same protein (19Brahma A. Bhattacharyya D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Majumdar S. Ghatak J. Mukherji S. Bhattacharjee H. Bhaduri A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In yeast, the epimerase/mutarotase protein is encoded by the GAL10 gene and thus for simplicity will hereafter be referred to as Gal10p. Recent sequence analyses have suggested that the N-terminal region of S. cerevisiae Gal10p, defined by the residues Met-1 to Thr-377, is homologous to the E. coli and human epimerases, whereas the C-terminal residues, Ile-378 to Ser-699, show sequence identity to the mutarotases from L. lactis and human (19Brahma A. Bhattacharyya D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Majumdar S. Ghatak J. Mukherji S. Bhattacharjee H. Bhaduri A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here we describe the cloning, over-expression in E. coli, protein purification, and x-ray crystallographic analysis of the S. cerevisiae Gal10p to 1.85-Å resolution. Strikingly, the molecule folds into two separate and distinct domains connected by a simple Type II turn. This investigation represents the first structural analysis of a dual function enzyme in the Leloir pathway. Cloning of the GAL10 Gene—The yeast GAL10 gene was PCR-amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA such that the forward and reverse primers added NheI and XhoI cloning sites, respectively. The gene was PCR-amplified with Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and standard cycling conditions. The PCR product was purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) followed by A-tailing and subsequent ligation into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) for sequencing purposes. E. coli DH5α cells were transformed with the resulting vector. The GAL10 gene was sequenced with the ABI Prism™ Big Dye primer cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosciences, Inc.), and one mutation was shown to be present, M518I. This was observed in three independent PCR reactions. The pGEM-T vector construct was then digested with NheI and XhoI, and the gene was separated from digestion by-products on a 1.0% agarose gel. The gene was excised from the gel, purified with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and ligated into the expression vector pET-28b(+) (Novagen) that was previously digested with NheI and XhoI. The pET28 plasmid was altered to provide a TEV protease recognition site thereby resulting in a construct that contains an additional 20 amino acid residues at the N terminus with the following sequence: MGSSHHHHHHSSENLYFQGH. E. coli DH5α cells were transformed with the ligation mixture and plated onto LB/agar plates for selection with kanamycin. Individual colonies were selected and cultured overnight, and plasmid DNA was extracted with the QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen). Plasmids were tested for insertion of the GAL10 gene by digestion with NheI and XhoI. Protein Expression and Purification—For protein expression, the pET28-GAL10 plasmid was used to transform E. coli HMS174(DE3) cells (Novagen). A starter culture from a single colony was grown overnight at 37 °C in LB media supplemented with kanamycin. Subsequently, 10 ml were transferred to 1000 ml of supplemented TB media (50 mg/liter kanamycin and 1 g/liter galactose) in a 2-liter shaker flask and grown at 37 °C until an optical density of ∼0.8 was achieved at 600 nm. The culture was then transferred to a shaker at room temperature (∼20 °C) and allowed to grow until an optical density of greater than 1.8 was obtained, at which point isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.05 mm. Cell growth was allowed to continue at room temperature for an additional 18 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen cells (250 g) were thawed in 750 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm galactose, 10 mm imidazole, and 300 mm NaCl (pH 8.0). The thawed cells were placed in an ice bath and disrupted by seven rounds of sonication (1-min duration each) separated by 5 min of cooling. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 25 min. The clarified supernatant was loaded onto a 25-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) that had been previously equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was then washed with lysis buffer until the absorbance reading at 280 nm reached background level. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 10–250 mm imidazole in lysis buffer. Protein-containing fractions were pooled based on purity as judged by SDS-PAGE and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, 100 mm galactose, and 100 mm NaCl (pH 8.0). The dialyzed protein was further purified by anion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography using a 6-ml Resource-Q column. The protein was eluted at pH 8.0 (25 mm Tris plus 100 mm galactose) with a linear gradient from 50–400 mm NaCl. Protein-containing fractions were again pooled based on purity as judged by SDS-PAGE and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, 100 mm galactose, and 200 mm NaCl (pH 8.0) and concentrated to 12.0 mg/ml based on an extinction coefficient of 0.95 cm/(mg·ml) as calculated with the program Protean (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI). A typical yield was ∼125 mg of protein/250 g of cells. Crystallization of Gal10p—A search for crystallization conditions was conducted at both room temperature and at 4 °C via the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion utilizing an “in-house” designed sparse matrix screen composed of 144 conditions. The best crystals were observed growing at room temperature from pentaerythritol propoxylate ((5/4 PO/OH), typical molecular weight 426) at pH 7.5 and 10 mm UDP-glucose. Large single crystals were subsequently obtained from hanging drop experiments with precipitant solutions of 20–25% pentaerythritol propoxylate buffered with 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) and enzyme concentrations of 12.0 mg/ml plus 10 mm UDP-glucose. Single crystals grew to maximum dimensions of ∼1.0 × 0.5 × 0.3 mm in 5–10 days. They belonged to the space group I222 with unit cell dimensions of a = 120.9 Å, b = 125.2 Å, and c = 142.3 Å. The asymmetric unit contained one monomer. Structural Analysis of Gal10p—An x-ray data set was collected to 1.85-Å resolution at 100 K with a Bruker AXS Platinum 135 charge-coupled device detector controlled with the Proteum software suite (PROTEUM, Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, WI). The x-ray source was CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU200 x-ray generator equipped with montel optics and operated at 50 kV and 90 mA. The x-ray data were processed with SAINT (version V7.06A, Bruker AXS Inc.) and internally scaled with SADABS 2G. M. Sheldrick, unpublished data. version 2005/1, Bruker AXS Inc.). Crystals were frozen for x-ray data collection at 100 K by transferring them to a cryoprotect solution composed of 36% pentaerythritol propoxylate (5/4 PO/OH), 15 mm UDP-glucose, 125 mm d-galactose, 350 mm NaCl, 6% ethylene glycol, and 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5).

Open table in a new tab The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program EPMR. The epimerase domain was first located using the x-ray coordinates for human epimerase (Protein Data Bank accession number 1EK6) as a search model. One solution with a correlation coefficient of 31% and an R-factor of 54% was identified. This fragment was then held stationary, and a second molecular replacement search was conducted using coordinates for human mutarotase (Protein Data Bank accession number 1SO0) as a search model. The best solution had a correlation coefficient of 43% and an R-factor of 48%. Several cycles of least squares refinement with the software package TNT (21Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 489-501Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar) followed by manual model building led to good overall improvement in the electron density corresponding to the epimerase domain but no improvement in the electron density corresponding to the mutarotase domain. At this point the protein loops in the region where the epimerase and mutarotase domains contact one another were removed, and the position for the mutarotase portion was reevaluated with EPMR. A new solution led to substantial improvement in the electron density for the mutarotase domain. Alternate cycles of manual model building and least squares refinement reduced the R-factor to 19.6% for all measured x-ray data to 1.85-Å resolution.

Open table in a new tab Quality of the X-ray Model—The overall quality of the model is excellent with only six residues lying well outside of the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The electron density for these residues (Phe-193, Ala-366, Asn-432, Ser-460, Ser-653, and Tyr-669) is unambiguous, and indeed, the homologous residues for Phe-193 in human epimerase and Asn-432 in human mutarotase adopt similar dihedral angles. The average B-factors for Phe-193, Ala-366, Asn-432, Ser-460, Ser-653, and Tyr-669 are 19.6, 24.6, 22.2, 22.0, 49.1, and 20.8 Å2, respectively. The first residue for which electron density is observable is Ser-11. There are breaks in the polypeptide chain between Phe-233 and Arg-240 and Tyr-305 and Val-315. These breaks occur in the epimerase domain and are located near the UDP-glucose binding pocket. Electron density in this area is broken and impossible to interpret with any certainty but is indicative of multiple conformations. Additionally, the UDP-glucose ligand appears disordered in the electron density map (Fig. 1a), which is most likely because of low occupancy. Previous investigations of human UDP-galactose 4-epimerase have demonstrated that it is this region that adopts different conformations depending upon the presence or absence of UDP-glucose in the active site. In all other structural analyses conducted in this laboratory on either the human or E. coli forms of UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, this region has always been well ordered and the UDP-glucose density unambiguous. Following the break between Tyr-305 and Val-315, the polypeptide chain backbone for Gal10p extends continuously to Ser-699, which is the C terminus. Electron density corresponding to the galactose moiety is shown in Fig. 1b. Overall Structure of the Gal10p Monomer—A ribbon representation of the Gal10p monomer, which has overall dimensions of ∼91 × 82 × 69 Å, is displayed in Fig. 2a. The polypeptide chain can be envisioned as two separate domains separated by a short loop. There are three cis-prolines observed at positions 150, 472, and 596. Both Pro-150 and Pro-596 reside on the surface of the molecule, whereas Pro-472 is located in the interstitial region formed between the two domains. The cis conformation at position 150 also occurs in both human and E. coli epimerases (18Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 22Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2149-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The epimerase domain of Gal10p extends from the N terminus to Gln-356 and adopts the typical topology observed for members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. Specifically, the N-terminal motif contains a modified Rossmann fold with a seven-stranded parallel β-sheet flanked by seven α-helices, whereas the C-terminal motif contains two β-strands and three major α-helical regions. The active site is wedged between the N- and C-terminal motifs. The mutarotase domain is formed by Glu-361 to Ser-699 and contains 21 β-strands. This type of β-sandwich architecture was first observed in domain 5 of β-galactosidase (23Jacobson R.H. Zhang X.J. DuBose R.F. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The active site for the mutarotase domain is located in a quite shallow cleft. Strikingly, the epimerase and mutarotase active sites within the monomer are separated by over 50 Å. Two sodium ions were identified in the electron density map for Gal10p. These ions are located within the interstitial region formed by the epimerase and mutarotase domains as indicated in Fig. 2b. The first ion (B-factor of 51.5 Å2) is coordinated by the side chains of Asn-351 and Gln-475, the carbonyl oxygen of Glu-350, and three water molecules in a distorted octahedral arrangement. The second ion (B-factor of 38.1 Å2) is surrounded in an octahedral environment by the carbonyl oxygens of Leu-357 and Val-360, and four water molecules. Metal-ligand bond lengths range from 2.3 to 3.0 Å. These ions may play a role in stabilizing the single loop that connects the epimerase and mutarotase domains. In addition to the loop connecting the two domains, the interface is also formed by Tyr-49 to Glu-67 (which constitutes the second helix and the third β-strand of the Rossmann fold), Glu-367 to Asp-372 (which is in random coil) and Phe-469 to Asp-480 (which lies in a β-strand). These regions are labeled A, B, and C, respectively, in Fig. 2a. The total buried surface area within the interfacial region is ∼2200 Å2 using a probe sphere of radius 1.4 Å (24Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5346) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2b, there is a patch of aromatic residues formed by Tyr-49 and Phe-65 of the epimerase domain and Tyr-371 of the mutarotase domain that participate in stacking interactions. There are also numerous hydrogen bonds that occur within the domain-domain interface including those formed between Nη2 of Arg-54 and O of Ile-474, Oϵ1 of Glu-56 and N of Gly-471, and Oϵ1 of Glu-67 and Oη of Tyr-371. Gal10p has been reported to be a homodimer (19Brahma A. Bhattacharyya D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Majumdar S. Ghatak J. Mukherji S. Bhattacharjee H. Bhaduri A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Crystals employed in this investigation belonged to the space group I222. In this crystalline lattice the dimeric enzyme packed with its local 2-fold rotational axis coincident to a crystallographic dyad. Shown in Fig. 2c is a ribbon representation of the homodimer, which has overall dimensions of ∼91 × 135 × 108 Å and an almost V-shaped appearance. The subunit-subunit interface is formed solely by a four-helix bundle contributed by the epimerase domains. This type of quaternary structural organization is virtually identical to that observed in both the E. coli and human epimerases (18Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 22Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2149-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The total buried surface for the homodimer is 1800 Å2. The Epimerase Active Site—A close-up view of the active site for the epimerase domain is shown in Fig. 3a. Potential hydrogen bonding interactions between the protein and the NAD+ are indicated by the dashed lines. Since the UDP-glucose moiety was not well ordered, Fig. 3a only depicts the protein region surrounding the dinucleotide. The relative orientation of the UDP-glucose with respect to the NAD+ ligand can be obtained from Fig. 1b. Note that the enzyme, as isolated and purified, contains tightly bound NAD(H). There are seven ordered water molecules lying within 3.2 Å of the dinucleotide, all of which are also observed in human UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (18Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). An intramolecular hydrogen bond (2.8 Å) occurs between the carboxamide nitrogen of the nicotinamide ring (which is in the syn conformation) and an α-phosphoryl oxygen. Both riboses of the dinucleotide adopt the C2′-endo pucker. Twenty-five hydrogen bonding interactions occur between the NAD+ and the protein or solvent. This type of extensive hydrogen bonding network is typical for the UDP-galactose 4-epimerases that bind the dinucleotide cofactor irreversibly. Tyr-163 and Lys-167, located near the nicotinamide ribose, belong to the signature sequence YXXXK that is characteristic for members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. Indeed, Tyr-163 or its structural equivalent in other enzymes serves as the catalytic base required for the epimerization reaction (18Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The Mutarotase Active Site—Shown in Fig. 3b is a stereo representation of the active site surrounding the bound galactose. The electron density reveals that only the β-anomer is present. This is in keeping with that observed for human mutarotase where only the β-anomer was present (7Thoden J.B. Timson D.J. Reece R.J. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23431-23437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) but in contrast to that for the L. lactis enzyme where the electron density clearly revealed the presence of both anomers (5Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20854-20861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The galactose is anchored to the protein via hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Asn-432, Arg-433, Asn-457, His-458, His-537, Tyr-539, Asp-599, and Glu-665. Based on the extensive structural, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic analyses conducted on the L. lactis mutarotase, it can be postulated that in the yeast enzyme Glu-665 most likely functions as the active site base and that His-537 serves as the active site acid. Comparison of Gal10p with Human UDP-Galactose 4-Epi-merase and Human Mutarotase—The structural correspondence between the epimerase domain of Gal10p and human epimerase is extensive with a root mean square deviation of 0.8 Å for 316 structurally equivalent α-carbons. The amino acid sequence identity between them is ∼54%. A superposition of the α-carbon traces for these two enzymes is given in Fig. 4a. The most striking difference is a six-residue deletion in Gal10p beginning at Thr-48. In human epimerase the sequence of this loop (labeled A in Fig. 4c) is Arg-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-Leu and cannot be accommodated in Gal10p because of the close proximity of the attached mutarotase domain. In addition to this deletion, there are two 4-residue insertions in Gal10p, relative to the human epimerase, beginning at Thr-143 and Tyr-268, respectively. The amino acid sequence identity between the Gal10p mutarotase domain and human mutarotase is 35%, and the two models correspond with a root mean square deviation of 1.2 Å for 285 structurally equivalent α-carbons. A comparison of the α-carbon traces for these proteins is depicted in Fig. 4b. The two proteins differ notably in a few places. Perhaps the most relevant is the change in conformation beginning at Ala-366 of Gal10p. The loop in Gal10p connecting the first and second β-strands of the mutarotase domain is two residues shorter but more importantly adopts a significantly different conformation (labeled B in Fig. 4c). This loop contains Tyr-371 that forms part of the previously described aromatic patch of the interstitial region. Conclusions—In most organisms the four enzymatic activities required for normal galactose metabolism exist as separate polypeptide chains. Yet in all yeast species for which complete genomes are known, the first and last enzymes of the pathway are contained within a single polypeptide chain. In the case of Gal10p from S. cerevisiae, the epimerase and mutarotase domains are completely separate structural units connected by a Type II turn (Leu-357 to Val-360). If and how the two active sites of Gal10p communicate with one another is currently not understood. Experiments designed to address this issue are presently under way. 3D. J. Timson, personal communication. The selective advantage of having the first and last enzymes of a metabolic pathway contained within a single polypeptide chain is not immediately apparent. Given the unusual shape of the Gal10p dimer (Fig. 2c), it is tempting to speculate, however, that some type of substrate channeling occurs in vivo. At present there is limited evidence in this regard. One recent investigation, however, has demonstrated that a green fluorescent protein-tagged fusion protein of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase from S. cerevisiae localizes to discrete spots in the cytoplasm of the majority of the cells tested (25Christacos N.C. Marson M.J. Wells L. Riehman K. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 70: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Strikingly, in those yeast cells lacking galactokinase, Gal10p, or both, this localization did not occur. Whether or not substrate channeling is occurring in the enzymes of the Leloir pathway is an intriguing question. The present structure is certainly provocative. Understanding the cellular organization of the Leloir pathway enzymes in vivo is clearly the next challenge in fully characterizing this important and fascinating metabolic pathway. We thank Drs. David J. Timson, Richard J. Reece, Judith Fridovich-Keil, and Victor Hong for helpful discussions."

The first predicted transmembrane helix of GlnP was cleaved off in the mature protein and most likely serves as the signal sequence for the extracytoplasmic substrate-binding domains. Deletion analysis showed that the substrate-binding domain, in the primary sequence of GlnP nearest to the translocator domain, is used as the receptor that delivers the substrate to the translocator. Membrane reconstitution of the detergent-solubilized and purified GlnPQ complex yielded proteoliposomes that transported glutamine and glutamic acid at the expense of ATP. The transport activity of GlnPQ increased with lumenal salt concentration and internal pH, but the mechanism of ionic activation of the transporter is distinct from that of other osmoregulatory ATP-binding cassette transporters and does not depend on the presence of anionic lipids.

https://openalex.org/W2077473543,"Thrombin stimulation of platelets triggers Tyr phosphorylation of several signaling proteins, most of which remain unidentified. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein 1 (HS1) undergoes a transient Tyr phosphorylation in human platelets stimulated with thrombin. The protein is synergistically phosphorylated by Syk and Lyn tyrosine kinases according to a sequential phosphorylation mechanism. By means of specific inhibitors (PP2, SU6656, and piceatannol) and phosphopeptide-specific antibodies, as well as by coimmunoprecipitation and binding competition experiments, we show that Syk acts as the primary kinase that phosphorylates HS1 at Tyr397 and that Syk phosphorylation is required for HS1 interaction with the Lyn SH2 domain. Upon docking to Syk-phosphorylated HS1, Lyn catalyzes the secondary phosphorylation of the protein at Tyr222. Once the secondary Tyr phosphorylation of HS1 is accomplished the protein dissociates from Lyn and undergoes a dephosphorylation process. HS1 Tyr phosphorylation does not occur when thrombin-induced actin assembly is inhibited by cytochalasin D even under conditions in which Syk and Lyn are still active. Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis shows that the agonist promotes HS1 migration to the plasma membrane and that the inhibition of Lyn-mediated secondary phosphorylation of HS1 abrogates the subcellular translocation of the protein. All together these results indicate that HS1 Tyr phosphorylation catalyzed by Syk and Lyn plays a crucial role in the translocation of the protein to the membrane and is involved in the cytoskeleton rearrangement triggered by thrombin in human platelets.

Platelet activation is accompanied by a remarkable increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a variety of signaling proteins. The phosphorylation occurs in successive waves suggesting that distinct mechanisms, taking place in temporal order, regulate the protein tyrosine kinase and/or phosphatase activities during the activation process (1Clark E.A.

Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that recombinant HS1 can be synergistically phosphorylated in vitro by Syk and tyrosine kinases belonging to the Src family (24Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O.

Syk phosphorylates Tyr378 and Tyr397 of the protein and generates high affinity binding sites for the Src family SH2 (Src homology 2) domain. This provides the structural requisite for the subsequent association with and the secondary phosphorylation of HS1 by Src-related tyrosine kinases (24Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O.

Because the HS1 sequential phosphorylation shown in vitro has never been demonstrated in intact cells, we examined both the occurrence and the mechanism of HS1 Tyr phosphorylation in thrombin-stimulated human platelets. Moreover, as these particular cells are devoid of nucleus and possess only part of the machinery required for apoptotic cell death, we investigated new potential physiological roles for HS1 Tyr phosphorylation. Our results demonstrate that HS1 undergoes a transient Tyr phosphorylation upon thrombin-induced stimulation of human platelets. The sequential steps underlying the mechanism of HS1 Tyr phosphorylation, synergistically catalyzed by Syk and Lyn tyrosine kinases, were dissected. Tyr phosphorylation of the protein is suggested to be dependent on actin assembly and involved in HS1 cellular migration to the plasma membrane associated with thrombin-elicited platelet activation.

After 10 min incubation at 30 °C, phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. In the experiments with the cdc2-(6–20) peptide, the reactions were stopped by spotting 25 μl of the incubation mixture onto P81 phosphocellulose paper, which was then processed as described elsewhere (27Donella-Deana A. Cesaro L. Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1438-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Subcellular Localization of HS1, Syk, and Lyn—Platelets were sonically disrupted in 1 ml of isotonic buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture. Cellular debris was isolated by 10 min centrifugation at 900 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 200,000 × g to separate the cytosol from the particulate fraction. The pellet was then incubated for 1 h in buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 instead of 1% Nonidet P-40. The Triton X-100-soluble fraction was obtained by centrifugation for 1 h at 200,000 × g. The remaining Triton-resistant material was referred to as the membrane cytoskeletal fraction. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Immunolocalization of HS1 by Fluorescence Microscopy—After stimulation with 50 milliunits/ml thrombin for 1 min at room temperature, either with or without pretreatment with 5 μm PP2, platelets were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4), and settled on glass slides. Platelets were permeabilized in 0.03% saponin-containing phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with monoclonal anti-HS1 antibody diluted 1/10 in phosphate-buffered saline, supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, HS1 labeling was revealed by incubation with goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibody for 1 h at 37 °C. Incubation with only the secondary antibody was used as negative control. Coverslips were then mounted in FluorSave Reagent™ (Calbiochem) for the fluorescence microscopic observation of cells that was carried out using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a digital CCD video-camera AxioCam Hr (Zeiss). Data were acquired and analyzed by AxioVision software (Zeiss). Immunostaining—Proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with the indicated antibody followed by the appropriate biotinylated second antibody and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The densitometric analysis of the anti-Tyr(P)-HS1 spots was performed by Image Station 440 (Kodak). HS1 Undergoes a Transient Tyr Phosphorylation in Human Platelets Stimulated by Thrombin—Stimulation of human platelets with thrombin triggered an increase of protein Tyr phosphorylation and the phosphorylation degree enhanced in the presence of pervanadate, a broad protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (Fig. 1A). HS1 is one of the proteins undergoing a transient Tyr phosphorylation, as judged by anti-Tyr(P) immunostaining of anti-HS1 IP obtained from cellular lysates (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–5). It is noteworthy that, despite the predicted molecular mass of about 54 kDa, the protein was constantly isolated on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass around 75 kDa, because of the rod-like shape and rigidity of its central region (25Brunati A.M. Donella-Deana A. James P. Quadroni M. Contri A. Marin O. Pinna L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7557-7756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments, performed with different thrombin concentrations, showed that HS1 Tyr phosphorylation reached the maximum at different stimulation times depending on the agonist concentration: the higher the thrombin concentration the faster the protein Tyr phosphorylation peak attainment. Henceforward we present results obtained upon platelet treatment with 50 milliunits/ml thrombin, which elicited HS1 Tyr phosphorylation that peaked at about 1 min of incubation and gradually declined thereafter. Because the decrease of protein Tyr phosphorylation was not ascribable to lesser amounts of immunoprecipitated HS1 (Fig. 1B), the occurrence of a dephosphorylation process, which rapidly followed the protein Tyr phosphorylation could be hypothesized. To validate this hypothesis the platelets were stimulated in the presence of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate. In these conditions the extent of the HS1 Tyr phosphorylation triggered by thrombin persisted throughout the time studied (Fig. 1B, lanes 6–10). Syk and Src-related Tyrosine Kinases Are Involved in HS1 Tyr Phosphorylation Triggered by Thrombin—In the attempt to assess whether in platelets Syk and Src kinases were indeed involved in HS1 Tyr phosphorylation, the cells were stimulated with thrombin in the presence of either the Syk inhibitor piceatannol or two structurally unrelated Src kinase inhibitors, PP2 and SU6656 (31Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol.

Preliminary in vitro experiments performed with Syk and Src tyrosine kinases purified from rat spleen (27Donella-Deana A. Cesaro L. Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O. Pinna L.A.

Biochem. 1996; 240: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) showed that PP2 and SU6656 were highly selective for Src kinases and did not affect Syk activity, whereas piceatannol inhibited also the Src kinases although with an IC50 4–6-fold higher than that displayed toward Syk (results not shown). On the basis of these findings we tested the action of the three inhibitors in thrombin-stimulated platelets. Fig. 2A shows the in vitro kinase activity exhibited by anti-Syk IP obtained from platelets stimulated in the absence or presence of kinase inhibitors. Thrombin treatment of human platelets induced a marked, although transient, increase of Syk activity compared with that of resting cells (Fig. 2A, columns 1–3). As expected, whereas PP2 and SU6656 did not appreciably affect Syk tyrosine kinase (Fig. 2A, columns 4–9), piceatannol almost completely inhibited this enzyme (Fig. 2A, columns 10–12). The Src family consists of at least nine non-receptor tyrosine kinases (Src, Lyn, Fyn, Fgr, Lck, Hck, Yes, Yrk, and Blk), which regulate a wide spectrum of events (34Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Among the Src kinases expressed in platelets we focused our attention on Lyn because this tyrosine kinase has been demonstrated both to constitutively associate with HS1 in resting hematopoietic cells (10Ingley E. Sarna M.K. Beaumont J.G. Tilbrook P.A. Tsai S. Takemoto Y. Williams J.H. Klinken S.P. J. Biol.

Immunoprecipitation experiments performed, in parallel with those of Fig. 2A, with anti-Lyn antibody showed that while Lyn activity in control platelets was almost undetectable, it was up-regulated (by about 9-fold) after 1 min of thrombin stimulation, and declined by about 25% after a further minute of incubation (Fig. 2B, columns 1–3). The reduced activities of both Syk and Lyn, detected after 2 min of thrombin stimulation, were expected as a consequence of the translocation of the two enzymes to the cellular cytoskeletal fraction from which the tyrosine kinases could not be immunoprecipitated. Treatment of platelets with either PP2 or SU6656 almost completely counteracted the Lyn activity (Fig. 2B, columns 4–9), whereas 15 μm piceatannol decreased by about 20% this enzyme activity (Fig. 2B, compare columns 2 and 3 with columns 11 and 12). Because piceatannol concentrations higher than 15 μm substantially reduced the Lyn activity also, this inhibitor concentration was used in all following experiments. To verify the specific contribution of Syk and Lyn in the cellular HS1 Tyr phosphorylation we analyzed this parameter in anti-HS1 IP obtained from platelets stimulated in the presence of the different inhibitors. Fig. 2C shows that the peak of HS1 Tyr phosphorylation triggered by thrombin is less in the presence of the Src inhibitor PP2 or SU6656 (compare lanes 2 with lanes 5 and 8). However, in these conditions, the residual HS1 anti-Tyr(P) immunostaining did not further decrease in the following minute (Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 6 and 8 and 9). This finding suggests that the Src-catalyzed phosphorylation of HS1 is a requisite for the following protein dephosphorylation, i.e. for the decrease of the phosphorylated protein amount observed after 2 min incubation in control conditions (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 3). The finding that PP3, an inactive analogue of PP2, was ineffective not only on Lyn activity but also on HS1 Tyr phosphorylation (not shown) supported the assumption of involvement of Src kinase(s) in the protein phosphorylation. When platelets were stimulated in the presence of piceatannol, which in our conditions inhibited drastically Syk and only partially Lyn (Fig. 2, A and B), the thrombin-elicited HS1 Tyr phosphorylation was completely abolished (Fig. 2C, lanes 11 and 12). To confirm that the HS1 tyrosines phosphorylated in platelets by Syk and Lyn were the same residues previously identified by us in in vitro experiments (24Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O.

Our recent studies have shown that His156 contributes to the 14-fold higher affinity that 3β-HSD1 exhibits for substrate and inhibitor steroids compared with human 3β-HSD2 containing Tyr156 in the otherwise identical catalytic domain. Our structural model of human 3β-HSD localizes His156 or Tyr156 in the subunit interface of the enzyme homodimer. The model predicts that Gln105 on one enzyme subunit has a higher probability of interacting with His156 on the other subunit in 3β-HSD1 than with Tyr156 in 3β-HSD2. The Q105M mutant of 3β-HSD1 (Q105M1) shifts the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for 3β-HSD substrate and inhibition constants (Ki) for epostane and trilostane to the much lower affinity profiles measured for wild-type 3β-HSD2 and H156Y1. However, the Q105M2 mutant retains substrate and inhibitor kinetic profiles similar to those of 3β-HSD2. Our model also predicts that Gln240 in 3β-HSD1 and Arg240 in 3β-HSD2 may be responsible for the 3-fold higher affinity of the type 1 isomerase activity for substrate steroid and cofactors. The Q240R1 mutation increases the isomerase substrate Km by 2.2-fold to a value similar to that of 3β-HSD2 isomerase and abolishes the allosteric activation of isomerase by NADH. The R240Q2 mutation converts the isomerase substrate, cofactor, and inhibitor kinetic profiles to the 4–14-fold higher affinity profiles of 3β-HSD1. Thus, key structural reasons for the substantially higher affinities of 3β-HSD1 for substrates, coenzymes, and inhibitors have been identified. These structure and function relationships can be used in future docking studies to design better inhibitors of the 3β-HSD1 that may be useful in the treatment of hormone-sensitive cancers and preterm labor.

The human type 1 (placenta, mammary gland, and prostate) and type 2 (adrenals, ovary, and testis) isoforms of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.145)/steroid Δ5-Δ4-isomerase (EC 5.3.3.1) (3β-HSD1 1The abbreviations used are: HSD, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone.1The abbreviations used are: HSD, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone. and 3β-HSD2) are encoded by two distinct genes that are expressed in a tissue-specific pattern (1Rheaume E.

As shown in Fig. 1, human 3β-HSD1 catalyzes the conversion of 3β-hydroxy-5-ene-steroids (dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and pregnenolone) to 3-oxo-4-ene-steroids (androstenedione and progesterone), and human 3β-HSD2 converts 17α-hydroxypregnenolone and pregnenolone to ultimately produce cortisol and aldosterone in the human adrenal, respectively (2Rainey W.E. Carr B.R. Sasano H. Suzuki T. Mason J.I. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 234-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). 17α-Hydroxylase/17,20 lyase (CYP17) in the human adrenal gland converts pregnenolone to DHEA, which is the major circulating steroid in humans as DHEA sulfate (2Rainey W.E. Carr B.R. Sasano H. Suzuki T. Mason J.I. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 234-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In placenta, androstenedione is converted by aromatase and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) to estradiol, which participates in the cascade of events that initiates labor in humans (2Rainey W.E. Carr B.R. Sasano H. Suzuki T. Mason J.I. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 234-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 3Kacsoh B. Endocrine Physiology. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2000: 566-567Google Scholar). Placental 3β-HSD1 also converts pregnenolone to progesterone to help maintain the uterus in a quiescent state throughout human pregnancy (3Kacsoh B. Endocrine Physiology. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2000: 566-567Google Scholar). In addition to placenta and other human peripheral tissues, the 3β-HSD1 is selectively expressed in breast tumors (4Gingras S. Moriggi R. Groner B. Simard J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 66-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and prostate tumors (5Geldof A.A. Dijkstra I. Newling D.W. Rao B.R. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 1349-1354PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gingras S. Simard J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4573-4584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where it catalyzes the first step in the conversion of circulating DHEA to estradiol or testosterone to promote tumor growth. Determination of the structure/function relationships of human 3β-HSD1 and 3β-HSD2 may lead to the development of highly specific inhibitors of 3β-HSD1 that can help control the timing of labor and slow the growth of hormone-sensitive tumors without inhibiting 3β-HSD2, so that steroidogenesis in the adrenal gland to produce cortisol and aldosterone is not compromised.The two-step reaction of 3β-HSD/isomerase using DHEA as substrate is shown in Fig. 2. This reaction scheme shows the reduction of NAD+ to NADH by the rate-limiting 3β-HSD activity and the requirement of this NADH for the activation of isomerase on the same enzyme protein. Because the isomerase reaction is irreversible, the 3β-HSD/isomerase cannot convert androstenedione to DHEA (7Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J.

According to our stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy study, NADH induces a time-dependent conformational change in the enzyme structure as the isomerase activity reaches a maximum over 1 min after the addition of the coenzyme (9Thomas J.L.

Because our structural model localizes His156/Tyr156 in the subunit interface (Fig. 4), the structural basis for the differences in 3β-HSD1 and 3β-HSD2 is investigated in this report by using site-directed mutagenesis to determine whether subunit interactions between Gln105 and His156 or Tyr156 are involved.Fig. 4A, homology model of the human 3β-HSD1 dimer interface showing the critical hydrogen-binding residues, Gln105 and His156, as well as the catalytic residues Tyr154 and Lys158.

Kinetic constants for the isomerase substrate were determined at 27 °C in incubations of 5-androstene-3,17-dione (20–100 μm), with or without NADH (0.05 mm) and purified enzyme (0.01–0.04 mg) in 0.02 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Isomerase activity was measured by the initial absorbance increase at 241 nm (due to androstenedione formation) as a function of time. Blank assays (zero enzyme and zero substrate) ensured that specific isomerase activity was measured as opposed to non-enzymatic, “spontaneous” isomerization (8Thomas J.L. Berko E.A. Faustino A. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1988; 31: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, isomerase incubations without added coenzyme (NADH) were used to measure any basal (zero coenzyme) isomerase activity in the mutants, and this basal activity was subtracted as a blank. Changes in absorbance were measured with a Varian (Sugar Land, TX) Cary 219 recording spectrophotometer. The Michaelis-Menten constants (Km and Vmax) were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk (1/S versus 1/V) plots and verified by Hanes-Woolf (S versus S/V) plots (14Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 109-111Google Scholar). The kcat values (min–1) were calculated from the Vmax values (nmol/min/mg) and represent the maximal turnover rate (nmol of product formed/min/nmol of enzyme dimer).Kinetic constants for the 3β-HSD cofactor were determined for the purified mutant and wild-type enzymes in incubations containing NAD+ (10–100 μm), dehydroepiandrosterone (100 μm), and purified enzyme (0.04 mg) in 0.02 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 27 °C using the spectrophotometric assay at 340 nm. Kinetic constants for the isomerase cofactor were determined in incubations of NADH (0–50 μm), 5-androstene-3,17-dione (100 μm), and purified enzyme (0.01–0.04 mg) in 0.02 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 27 °C using the spectrophotometric assay at 241 nm. Zero coenzyme blanks were used as described above for the substrate kinetics.Inhibition constants (Ki) were determined for the inhibition of the wild-type 1, wild-type 2, Q240R1, and R240Q2 3β-HSD activities by epostane and trilostane using conditions that were appropriate for each enzyme species. For Q240R1 and 3β-HSD1, the incubations at 27 °C contained subsaturating concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone (4.0 and 8.0 μm, relative to substrate Km values of 3.7–6.1 μm), epostane or trilostane (0–1.0 μm), NAD+ (0.1 mm), and purified human type 1 enzyme (0.03–0.04 mg) in 0.02 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. For Q105M1, Q105M2, R240Q2, and 3β-HSD2, similar incubations contained 10.0 or 20.0 μm dehydroepiandrosterone, and the concentration ranges of epostane and trilostane were 0–10.0 μm. Dixon analysis (I versus 1/V) was used to determine the type of inhibition and calculate the Ki values (14Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics.

These amino acids were predicted to be critical residues by our modeled tertiary/quaternary structure for human 3β-HSD (Figs. 3 and 4). The locations of these targeted residues plus other key amino acids are indicated in the primary structures of 3β-HSD1 and 3β-HSD2 (Fig. 5).

For the dehydrogenase activity, the Q105M1 mutant demonstrates an 11-fold higher Km value for substrate and a 2-fold higher kcat value than 3β-HSD1, which are similar to those of 3β-HSD2 and to those reported previously for the H156Y1 mutant enzyme (DHEA Km = 42.4 μm, kcat = 7.2 min–1) (11Thomas J.L. Mason J.I. Brandt S. Spencer B.R. Norris W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42795-42801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The Q105M2 mutant exhibits DHEA kinetic constants that are similar to those of 3β-HSD2 with almost identical utilization efficiencies (kcat/Km). The Q105M1 and Q105M2 mutant enzymes retain isomerase substrate Km values similar to the appropriate 3β-HSD1 or 3β-HSD2 isoform. Both Q105M mutant enzymes exhibit reduced isomerase activity (kcat) compared with their wild-type enzyme counterpart. The Q240R1 mutant has a slightly elevated Km value and a diminished kcat value for DHEA to yield a substrate utilization efficiency (kcat/Km) that is similar to wild-type 3β-HSD2. The R240Q2 mutant exhibits a decreased Km and elevated kcat for DHEA to yield a utilization efficiency (kcat/Km) that lies midway between wild-type 3β-HSD1 and 3β-HSD2. The Q240R1 mutation shifts the isomerase substrate Km value to a 2.2-fold higher level that is comparable with the isomerase substrate Km of wild-type 3β-HSD2. Similarly, the R240Q2 mutation shifts the isomerase substrate Km and kcat values from the wild-type 2 to the wild-type 1 profile.Table IISubstrate kinetics for the 3β-HSD and isomerase activities of the purified mutant and wild-type enzymesPurified enzyme3β-HSDaKinetic constants for the 3β-HSD substrate (DHEA) were determined in incubations at 27 °C containing NAD+ (200 μm), dehydroepiandrosterone (3-100 μm), and purified enzyme (0.04 mg) in 0.02 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42795-42801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the Q105M1 mutant enzyme exhibits the shift in 3β-HSD substrate kinetics to the 3β-HSD2 profile (Table II), but the mutation does not affect the Km values of NAD+ as the cofactor for the 3β-HSD1 reaction or of NADH as the allosteric activator of type 1 isomerase (Table III). The Q105M2 mutant enzyme retains Km and kcat values for NAD+ utilization and for the NADH activations of isomerase that are similar to those measured for wild-type 3β-HSD2 (Table III). The Q240R1 mutation has little effect on the Km value of 3β-HSD1 for NAD+ but disrupts the concentration-dependent activation of type 1 isomerase by NADH (Table III and Fig. 7). The basal isomerase activity of Q240R1 in the absence of NADH is 22% of the wild-type 3β-HSD1 isomerase after maximal activation by NADH. In contrast, the basal isomerase activities of 3β-HSD1, 3β-HSD2, R240Q2, Q105M1, and Q105M2 are only 5–10% of the kcat of NADH-activated isomerase, and NADH stimulates that basal activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 7). The R240Q2 mutant of 3β-HSD2 shifts the Km of NAD+ utilization to a 2.3-fold lower value that is similar to the value measured for 3β-HSD1 and to a 3.9-fold lower Km for the NADH-activation of isomerase, which is comparable with that of type 1 isomerase (Table III).Table IIICofactor kinetics for the 3β-HSD and isomerase activities of the purified mutant and wild-type enzymesPurified enzyme3β-HSD NAD+aKinetic constants for the 3β-HSD cofactor were determined in incubations at 27 °C containing NAD+ (13 100 μm), dehydroepiandrosterone (100 μm), and purified enzyme (0.03 mg) in 0.02 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4.

https://openalex.org/W2015578288,"p130cas (Crk-associated substrate) is a docking protein that is involved in assembly of focal adhesions and concomitant cellular signaling. It plays a role in physiological regulation of cell adhesion, migration, survival, and proliferation, as well as in oncogenic transformation. The molecule consists of multiple protein-protein interaction motifs, including a serine-rich region that is positioned between Crk and Src-binding sites. This study reports the first structure of a functional domain of Cas. The solution structure of the serine-rich region has been determined by NMR spectroscopy, demonstrating that this is a stable domain that folds as a four-helix bundle, a protein-interaction motif. The serine-rich region bears strong structural similarity to four-helix bundles found in other adhesion components like focal adhesion kinase, α-catenin, or vinculin. Potential sites for phosphorylation and interaction with the 14-3-3 family of cellular regulators are identified in the domain and characterized by site-directed mutagenesis and binding assays. Mapping the degree of amino acid conservation onto the molecular surface reveals a patch of invariant residues near the C terminus of the bundle, which may represent a previously unidentified site for protein interaction. p130cas (Crk-associated substrate) is a docking protein that is involved in assembly of focal adhesions and concomitant cellular signaling.

Focal adhesions (FAs) 1The abbreviations used are: FA, focal adhesion; ECM, extracellular matrix; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FAT, focal adhesion targeting; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. are multiprotein signaling complexes that form at the sites of integrin-mediated contact between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) (1Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). They physically link the ECM with the actin cytoskeleton, and transduce signals between the ECM and the cytosol that regulate key aspects of cell behavior, including proliferation, differentiation, and migration. On the molecular level, this signaling is accomplished by protein-ligand or protein-protein interactions, conformational changes, and covalent modifications, in particular phosphorylation (2Giancotti F.G.

One of the proteins that is recruited to FAs and that is involved in orchestrating the assembly of other FA components (as well as the concomitant signaling) is p130cas (Crk-associated substrate). This docking protein contains multiple protein-protein interaction motifs (4Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H.

The association between 14-3-3 and Cas is regulated by integrin-mediated cell adhesion and is phosphoserine-dependent (26Garcia-Guzman M. Dolfi F. Russello M. Vuori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5762-5768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), but the precise role of this interaction in cellular signaling is not yet understood. Within p130cas, a serine-rich region (Fig. 1) is likely to be one of the major sites for 14-3-3 binding. Two putative 14-3-3 recognition motifs are found in this region. Here, we present the structure of this serine-rich domain of rat Cas that we solved using NMR spectroscopy. This represents the first structure reported for a functional region unique to the Cas family proteins. The serine-rich domain folds into an independent, stable domain composed of a four-helix bundle, a structural motif that is also employed to mediate protein-protein interactions by other components of FAs and adherens junctions, such as FAK, α-catenin, and vinculin (30Yang J.

The structure presents a molecular framework to consider protein-protein interactions that are mediated by this domain in p130cas. NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Calculation—The serine-rich domain of rat p130cas (termed SRR-B) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione transferase (GST) fusion protein and purified as described elsewhere (37Nasertorabi F.

After thrombin cleavage, the recombinant protein encompassed residues 548–708 of Cas (GREP... RTKA) (4Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) preceded by two extraneous amino acids (GS). Despite the presence of reducing agent in the samples, the single cysteine in the protein (Cys680) became oxidized during NMR data collection, as evidenced by its Cβ chemical shift. Samples for most NMR experiments contained 1–2 mm unlabeled, 15N- or 13C/15N-labeled SRR-B, 20 mm 2H11-Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzene fluoride in 90% H2O plus 10% 2H2O at pH 7.9. Spectra were acquired at 25 °C on Varian 500-, 600-, and 750-MHz spectrometers equipped with UnityPlus or Inova consoles. The data were processed and analyzed with Felix 2000 (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, California). 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments were established based on two-dimensional 1H-15N and 1H-13C HSQC, double quantum-filtered COSY, TOCSY, three-dimensional 15N-edited TOCSY, HNHA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, C(CO)NH, H(CCO)NH, and HCCH-TOCSY experiments, which were recorded with standard ProteinPack pulse sequences (Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Three-dimensional C(CO)NH and H(CCO)NH data sets were also acquired for partially deuterated, uniformly 13C/15N-labeled protein that was expressed in minimal medium containing 65% 2H2O (Isotec) plus 35% H2O and protonated 13C glucose. Backbone assignment was aided by four-dimensional 15N/15N-edited NOESY (38Grzesiek S. Wingfield P. Stahl S. Kaufman J.D. Bax A. J. Am. Chem.

To evaluate backbone conformational flexibility, steady-state 1H-15N NOEs for individual residues were determined from two-dimensional heteronuclear experiments (39Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E.

Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Four long α-helical segments were identified in SRR-B by both TALOS and chemical shift index (45Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar, 46Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar) and were supported by characteristic NOE patterns. Only those TALOS restraints were used in structure calculations that were consistent with α-helical conformation and that were located within these deduced α-helices. Consequently, restraints were also introduced to enforce the expected hydrogen bonds in the α-helical segments. Structures were calculated with XPLOR-NIH 2.9.4a (47Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Res. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). The calculation employed a total of 1562 unambiguous distance restraints (166 long range, 245 medium range, 346 sequential, and 805 intraresidual), 6 ambiguous long range distance restraints, 176 hydrogen bond restraints, 107 ϕ and 107 ψ dihedral angle restraints, and 79 rdc restraints. First, 99 structures were calculated with an annealing protocol that allowed optimization of the magnitude and rhombicity of the alignment tensor. Then structures were subjected to a refinement protocol that included also 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shift term (48Kuszewski J. Qin J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn.

Single point mutations were carried out using PCR and the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The DNA constructs encoding GST fusion proteins of 14-3-3ζ and 14-3-3ζ (K49E) have been described earlier (26Garcia-Guzman M. Dolfi F. Russello M. Vuori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5762-5768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Binding of wild-type or mutant proteins was tested with GST pull-down assays. COS-1 cells at 90% confluence were transfected with pcDNA3.1-HA-SRR-B wild-type or mutants using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were harvested after 36 h, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed on ice for 10 min in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation, normalized for protein amount, and kept at –20 °C until further use. In vitro association assays were carried out with GST fusion proteins of either the full-length wild type 14-3-3 or the K49E mutant expressed in E. coli. Bacteria were harvested, and pellets were resuspended in ice-cold PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. After sonication, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The beads were then washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, resuspended in the same buffer, and checked by SDS-PAGE to verify the purity of bound 14-3-3 proteins. COS-1 cell lysates containing SRR-B were incubated with beads alone or beads loaded with the 14-3-3 fusion proteins for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed and resuspended in loading buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and standard Western blotting techniques. Immunoblotting was performed with mouse anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and the immunoreactive bands were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce). Peptide Docking Simulations—Computational docking simulations were implemented to evaluate molecular interactions between Cas peptide 590Ser-Thr-Ser(P)-Glu-Pro594 and 14-3-3ζ, using AutoDock version 3.0.5 (55Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comp. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9301) Google Scholar). The Lamarkian genetic algorithm was utilized for peptide conformational searching. The protonation state for the docking target 14-3-3ζ (Protein Data Bank code 1QJB (56Rittinger K. Budman J. Xu J.

The peptide was in an extended configuration with torsional freedom including 10 side-chain torsion angles. The docking parameters were as follows: 100 docking trials, population size of 150, random starting position and torsional conformation, translation step ranges of 1.5 Å, rotation step ranges of 35°, elitism of 1, mutation rate of 0.02, crossover rate of 0.8, local search rate of 0.06, and 100 million energy evaluations. Final docked conformations were clustered using a tolerance of 1.5-Å root mean square deviation. The docking protein Cas contains multiple protein interaction domains, shown schematically in Fig. 1. A region that is enriched in serines and threonines is located between the Crk-binding and Src-binding sites of full-length Cas and may serve to separate and orient these key signaling domains but also may play an independent functional role, which is being characterized. This region was selected for structural investigations. Our initial experiments with a protein encompassing the whole serine-rich region (residues 520–712) revealed that it was susceptible to proteolytic degradation during purification. A stable fragment that was ∼3 kDa smaller remained and was apparently resistant to further degradation. Since there was little or no predicted secondary structure outside the residue range 550–707, we designed a new construct termed SRR-B that included only residues 548–708 (37Nasertorabi F. Garcia-Guzman M. Briknarová K. Larsen E. Havert M.L. Vuori K. Ely K.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The resulting protein retained the ability to associate with 14-3-3 (Fig. 2A) and was very stable and soluble, especially at pH values close to or above 8.0. Here we report the structural characterization of this molecule. SRR-B Is a Four-helix Bundle—SRR-B is an independently folded structural domain consisting of four α-helices arranged into an elongated antiparallel bundle (Fig. 3). Well defined α-helical regions comprise residues 554–579 (α1), 599–624 (α2), 634–659 (α3), and 671–702 (α4). The first three α-helices may even extend slightly further at their C termini, since residues 580–583 after α1, 525–527 after α2, and 660–661 after α3 still exhibit some chemical shifts and medium range NOEs that are characteristic for α-helical conformation. However, some residues in these flanking regions also exhibit weak or missing backbone amide cross-peaks in 1H-15N HSQC spectrum or lower 1H-15N NOE (X-NOE) values that are more typical for the loops. Hence, these residues may form transient α-helical structure in a transition from the stable α-helical core to the less ordered loops. The helices are connected by relatively long loops that exhibit considerable conformational flexibility, as indicated by the absence of some backbone amide cross-peaks from 1H-15N HSQC spectrum and low 1H-15N NOE (X-NOE) values of residues with detectable signals (Fig. 4). There is a kink in the middle of α4 at Pro685 and a sharp bend at Asn698 that places the last turn of the α-helix as a cap on top of the bundle (Fig. 3).Fig. 4Backbone amide dynamics of SRR-B: 1H-15N NOE data. The secondary structure of SRR-B is outlined at the top. α-Helical regions are also indicated in the plot, using a gray scale similar to Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Overall, hydrophobic residues are buried inside the bundle, and the surface is predominately hydrophilic with charged residues evenly distributed (Fig. 5, A and B). A comparison of the amino acid sequences of other members of the Cas family shows strong conservation in this domain within the helical segments (especially for mammals) and weaker homology in the unstructured loops connecting α1-α2 and α3-α4 (see alignment in Fig. 3). From this comparison, it appears that the four-helix bundle seen in Cas SRR-B is structurally conserved in mammals, including the length of the four helical segments. The structural conservation may also extend to domains found in other vertebrates as well as in Drosophila. Interestingly, in the closest nonmammalian Cas homologues, as well as in human Hef1 proteins, the relative sizes of loops connecting α1-α2 and α3-α4 are reversed. The two special structural features associated with α4, a kink at proline 685 and a sharp bend at asparagine 698, are expected to be maintained in other members of the Cas family, since these two residues are each highly conserved. Four-helix bundles similar to that of SRR-B are found in several other cell adhesion components, in particular α-catenin, vinculin, and FAK. Whereas FAK contains a single four-helix bundle, namely the FAT domain (32Hayashi I. Vuori K. Liddington R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 33Hoellerer M.K. Noble M.E.M. Labesse G. Campbell I.D. Werner J.M. Arold S.T.

Most recently, talin was also shown to employ α-helical bundles in its architecture (36Papagrigoriou E. Gingras A.R. Barsukov I.L. Bate N. Fillingham I.J. Patel B. Frank R. Ziegler W.H. Roberts G.C.K. Critchley D.R. Emsley J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2942-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Despite limited sequence homology, SRR-B is structurally similar to some of these helix bundles, as shown in Fig. 5, E–H. In this comparison, it can be noted that the length and orientation of the α-helices are closely similar. The main differences unique to SRR-B include the kinked terminus of α4 that caps the structure and the unusually long loop between α1 and α2. The four-helix bundles of FAK, α-catenin, and vinculin play important roles in mediating protein-protein interactions, often by binding another α-helix from the partner protein. The FAT domain of FAK interacts with α-helical paxillin LD motifs (33Hoellerer M.K. Noble M.E.M. Labesse G. Campbell I.D. Werner J.M. Arold S.T.

APOB R3480P heterozygotes were identified among 9,255 individuals from the general population and had reduced levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Most surprisingly, R3480P LDL bound with lower affinity to the LDL receptor than non-carrier LDL in vitro, and these results were confirmed by turnover studies of LDL in vivo. In very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) turnover studies, the amount of VLDL converted to LDL in R3480P heterozygotes was substantially reduced, suggesting that this was the explanation for the hypobetalipoproteinemia observed in these individuals. Our findings emphasized the importance of combining in vitro studies with both human in vivo and population-based studies, as in vitro studies often have focused on very limited aspects of complex mechanisms taken out of their natural context.

Studies of the three-dimensional structure of apoB-100 by immunoelectron microscopy have suggested that apoB-100 enwraps VLDL, IDL, and LDL particles like a belt, completing the encirclement by about amino acid residue 4050, and that the carboxyl-terminal end forms a bow that crosses backwards over the chain between residues 3000 and 3500 (3Chatterton J.E.

In contrast, after lipolysis had transformed VLDL into IDL and finally LDL, the carboxyl-terminal bow moved sufficiently to allow interaction of apoB-100 with the LDL receptor. Furthermore, mutagenesis studies in mice by Borén et al. (4Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin.

In humans, three point mutations have been reported around this site in the APOB gene. All three mutations result in the loss of arginines and in varying degrees of decreased receptor affinity in vitro, reflected in the varying effects on lipid and lipoprotein levels in vivo; R3500Q and R3500W are associated with moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia, whereas R3531C has no effect or a marginal effect on lipid levels in the general population in vivo (5Soria L.F.

Mutations resulting in truncations of apoB-100 are known to abolish LDL receptor binding when located amino-terminal to the putative binding site at amino acids 3359–3369 (site B), indicating that this site is crucial for receptor interaction. In contrast, apoB truncations enhance LDL receptor binding when located carboxyl-terminal to the binding site, indicating that the negative regulatory effect of the bow of apoB-100 can be abolished by removal of the carboxyl-terminal tail (9Parhofer K.G. Barrett P.H.R. Bier D.M. Schonfeld G. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 89: 1931-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Gabelli C. Bilato C. Martini S. Tennyson G.E. Zech L.A. Corsini A.

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 521-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mutation in APOB, R3480P, located in the region where the carboxyl-terminal bow crosses over the main apoB-100 chain, and briefly mentioned in a previous paper (12Nissen H. Hansen P.S. Færgeman O. Hørder M. Clin. Chem. 1995; 41: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), led us to the following hypothesis. Because this mutation causes a substitution of the basic side chain of arginine with the non-polar of proline in an α-helical region, the R3480P mutation might have an impact on both the secondary and tertiary structure of apoB-100, and thus on the affinity of apoB-100 for the LDL receptor via a change in the negative regulatory effect of the carboxyl-terminal bow. This then could affect LDL levels, catabolism, and production in R3480P heterozygotes. To study the effect of the R3480P mutation in apoB-100 on the levels of lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins and to characterize the effect of the mutation on LDL metabolism, we screened 13,427 Danish individuals (9,255 individuals from the general population (The Copenhagen City Heart Study) and 4,172 patients with ischemic cardiovascular disease or hyperlipidemia) for the presence of this mutation. In R3480P heterozygotes, we determined lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins, and we compared these with the corresponding values in non-carriers in the general population of the same age, sex, and APOE genotype. The relative LDL receptor affinity of R3480P LDL and non-carrier LDL was determined in vitro in a competitive receptor-binding assay in normal human fibroblasts. In in vivo turnover studies of iodinated LDL, we compared fractional catabolic rate (FCR) and production rate (PR) of LDL from R3480P, R3480W, R3500Q, and R3531C heterozygotes with simultaneously injected iodinated LDL from non-carriers. Finally, in in vivo turnover studies of iodinated VLDL, we estimated the amount of VLDL from R34380P heterozygotes converted to LDL compared with the conversion of non-carrier VLDL. This design with simultaneous injection of differently labeled R3480P LDL (or VLDL) and non-carrier LDL (or VLDL) excludes all variation because of differences between recipients, because the two types of lipoprotein are metabolized by the exact same pathways in the same recipient. Thus, even small differences in metabolism because of differences in LDL (or VLDL) particles can be detected accurately. Subjects—The Copenhagen City Heart Study (1991–1994) comprised an almost equal number of women (55%) and men stratified into 10-year age groups from 20 to 80 years and above, drawn randomly from the Copenhagen Central Population Register, with the aim of drawing a sample representative of the adult Danish general population (13Appleyard M. Tybjærg-Hansen A. Jensen G. Schnohr P. Nyboe J. Scand. J. Soc. Med. 1989; 41: 1-160Google Scholar, 14Schnohr P. Jensen G. Lange P. Scharling H. Appleyard M. Eur. Heart J. 2001; 3: H1-H83Google Scholar); 9,255 individuals were genotyped for the present study. A second population comprised 4,172 patients with a primary diagnosis of ischemic heart disease (n = 3,479), ischemic cerebrovascular disease (n = 452), or hyperlipidemia (n = 241). In total, 13,427 individuals (n = 9,255 + 4,172) were genotyped for the present study, and of these 99% were white and of Danish descent. The studies were approved by institutional review boards and Danish ethical committees as follows: 100.2039/91, KF 01-375/94, KF 01-372/94, Copenhagen and Frederiksberg committee, and KA 93125 and KA 92273, Copenhagen County committee and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants gave written informed consent. Rabbit studies were approved by the Danish Animal Experiment Board. Detection of Mutations—The R3480P mutation was caused by the substitution of cytosine for guanine at position 10,648 in complementary DNA, in exon 26 of the APOB gene on chromosome 2p24 (15Cladaras C.

Knott T. Scott J. Mahley R.W. Levy-Wilson B. McCarthy B.J. DNA (N. Y.). 1987; 6: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). DNA from each of the 13,427 individuals was subjected to PCR (forward primer, 5′GAAAGCCTCACCTCTTACTTTTCCATTGAG3′, and reverse primer, 5′GAAATCCCATAAGCTCTTGTCATAGACCGG3′) with an annealing temperature of 65 °C followed by digestion with MspI. The mismatched C introduced 3′ in the reverse primer introduced an internal control site for MspI. The R3500Q and R3531C mutations were identified as described previously (8Tybjærg-Hansen A. Steffensen R. Meinertz H. Schnohr P. Nordestgaard B.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1577-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar); a single carrier with R3480W was identified accidentally during sequencing of this apoB-100 region in individuals intended to be used as non-carriers in turnover studies. The presence of all mutations was confirmed by sequencing. APOE genotype was determined as described previously (17Frikke-Schmidt R. Nordestgaard B.G. Agerholm-Larsen B. Schnohr P. Tybjærg-Hansen A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1812-1822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Apolipoproteins—Colorimetric and turbidimetric assays were used to measure plasma levels of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and apoB (8Tybjærg-Hansen A. Steffensen R. Meinertz H. Schnohr P. Nordestgaard B.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1577-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The sizes of LDL and apoB were determined as described previously (18Krauss R.M. Burke D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 97-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nordestgaard B.G.

From plasma samples of three mutation carriers (proband number 1, proband number 4, and his 39-year-old son) and 30 non-carriers, matched for age in 10-year age groups, sex, and APOE genotype, lipoprotein fractions were isolated using ultracentrifugation in a fixed angle rotor (Beckman 50.4 Ti rotor and Beckman L8–70 ultracentrifuge, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) at 50,000 × g using density adjustment with NaCl/NaBr solution. Cholesterol and triglycerides were measured in VLDL (d <1.006 g/ml), IDL (1.006 g/ml < d < 1.019g/ml), LDL (1.019 g/ml < d < 1.063g/ml), and HDL cholesterol (d > 1.063 g/ml). In Vitro Competitive Receptor Binding Assay of LDL—Competitive receptor binding assays were performed as described by Arnold et al. (21Arnold K. Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. Converse C.A. Skinner E.R. Lipoprotein Analysis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 145-168Google Scholar). In brief, human wild type fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with Glutamax I and Hepes 25 mm) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. To up-regulate LDL receptors, cells were transferred to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum 2 days before each experiment. Non-carrier human 125I-labeled LDL cholesterol (5 μg/ml), along with increasing concentrations of unlabeled R3480P or non-carrier LDL, was added to the cells in phosphate-buffered saline and 10% human lipoprotein-deficient serum. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, the surface-bound radioactivity was determined. Counts per min in each well were adjusted for differences in cell growth by measuring the protein content in lysates and calculating the number of counts/mg of cell protein. The number of counts/mg of cell protein was corrected for unspecific binding. The amount of unlabeled LDL needed to displace 50% of normal 125I-labeled LDL after a 2-h incubation was determined (21Arnold K. Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. Converse C.A. Skinner E.R. Lipoprotein Analysis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 145-168Google Scholar). In Vivo LDL and VLDL Turnover Studies—Human LDL turnover studies were performed in vivo to estimate FCR and PR of LDL from R3480P, R3480W, R3500Q, and R3531C heterozygotes versus LDL from non-carriers simultaneously injected in the same recipient; this measure of LDL production rate assumes that production equals catabolism. For R3480P LDL, findings in humans (with low LDL receptor activity) were supplemented with turnover studies in rabbits (with high LDL receptor activity). Human VLDL turnover studies were performed in vivo to estimate the FCR of VLDL, and the amount of VLDL converted to LDL from R3480P heterozygotes versus VLDL from non-carriers was simultaneously injected in the same recipient. Isolation and iodination of LDL (1.019–1.050 g/ml to exclude lipoprotein(a)) and the protocol for 8-day turnover studies were exactly as described previously (22Kornerup K. Nordestgaard B.G. Feldt-Rasmussen B. Borch-Johnsen K. Jensen K.S. Jensen J.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 23Egusa G. Brady D.W. Grundy S.M. Howard B.V. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1261-1267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VLDL (d < 1.019 g/ml) turnover studies were performed in the same way, except that radioactivity in apolipoprotein B was precipitated in lipoprotein fractions with isopropyl alcohol (19Nordestgaard B.G. Tybjærg-Hansen A. Lewis B. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 6-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), instead of total plasma protein precipitation with trichloroacetic acid as in the LDL study (22Kornerup K. Nordestgaard B.G. Feldt-Rasmussen B. Borch-Johnsen K. Jensen K.S. Jensen J.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of LDL, defined as the fraction of the intravascular pool of LDL catabolized per day, was calculated according to the method of Matthews (25Matthews C.M.E. Phys. Med. Biol. 1957; 2: 36-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), where FCR = 1/(C1/b1 + C2/b2), using the SAAM II software (26SAAM Institute SAAM II. University of Washington, Seattle2002Google Scholar). Production rate was calculated by multiplying the pool size of LDL (mmol/kg) by the FCR (1/day) of LDL and was expressed as mmol/kg body weight/day. Pool size of LDL was the product of plasma LDL (mmol/liter) and plasma volume (liter/kg), estimated by isotope dilution at 10 min after injection of labeled LDL. Because steady state plasma LDL cholesterol levels were significantly lower in R3480P heterozygotes than in non-carriers, we used the individual LDL cholesterol levels of R3480P heterozygotes and of non-carriers to calculate the estimated pool sizes of LDL. The amount of VLDL converted to LDL (mmol/kg/day) was calculated by multiplying the pool size of VLDL (mmol/kg) with the FCR of VLDL (pools/day). FCR of VLDL was estimated directly from human in vivo VLDL turnover studies using a four-compartment model in the SAAM II software (26SAAM Institute SAAM II. University of Washington, Seattle2002Google Scholar); Dr. P. Hugh Barrett helped us optimize the model that best described the VLDL kinetic data. Fractional catabolic rate of VLDL cholesterol k(3,1), defined as the fraction of the intravascular pool of VLDL catabolized to LDL per day, was determined with the SAAM II software using a four-compartment model. The model consisted of two VLDL compartments (q1 and q2) and two LDL compartments (q3 and q4). Dose was injected into q1 and q2, and samples were drawn from q1 + q2 and q3. Fluxes were estimated for the following: k(0,1), the direct removal of VLDL from compartment q1; k(0,2), the direct removal of VLDL from compartment q2; k(0,3), the direct removal of LDL from compartment q3; k(2,1), the transfer of VLDL from compartments q1 to q2; k(3,1), the transfer from compartment q1 to q3, i.e. the fractional catabolic rate of VLDL or the fraction of VLDL converted to LDL in pools per day; k(3,4) and k(4,3) the transfer between compartments q3 and q4. Pool sizes (mmol/kg) for the two lipoprotein fractions were taken as the product of plasma volume (liter/kg) estimated by isotope dilution at 10 min after injection of the labeled VLDL and the plasma concentration at steady state (mmol/liter). Production of LDL from VLDL (mmol/kg/day) was calculated by multiplying the pool size of VLDL (mmol/liter) with the fractional catabolic rate of VLDL (pools/day). Statistical Analysis—Because the four R3480P heterozygotes identified in the general population were all homozygous for the APOE ϵ33 genotype, all comparisons were restricted to individuals with the ϵ33 genotype throughout the study. Data were analyzed with SPSS and Minitab computer programs (27.SPSS Inc. (1999) SPSS for Windows, Release 11.5.0, ChicagoGoogle Scholar, 28Inc Minitab Minitab for Windows, Minitab Release 10.5. Xtra Minitab Inc., State College, PA1995Google Scholar). To examine the effect of R3480P on phenotype in heterozygotes identified in the general population, we converted values for continuous variables for heterozygotes to their respective percentiles within each 10-year age group and by sex, and we compared them with the values of ϵ33 homozygotes in the general population as a whole, using z-scores, as described previously (8Tybjærg-Hansen A. Steffensen R. Meinertz H. Schnohr P. Nordestgaard B.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1577-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 29Armitage P. Berry G. Statistical Methods in Medical Research. 3rd Ed. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford2002: 1-620Crossref Google Scholar). The absolute increase or decrease in a given variable in R3480P heterozygotes was calculated by subtracting the 50th percentile value for non-carriers in the general population matched for age (in 10-year age groups), sex, and APOE genotype (ϵ33) from the value of the individual R3480P heterozygote; the mean increases or decreases for a given variable were compared with the normal distribution with μ = 0 by a 1-sample t test. All p values are two-sided, and a p value less than or equal to 0.05 is considered to indicate statistical significance. Frequency of the APOB R3480P Mutation—Four of 9,255 subjects in the general population (carrier frequency, 0.04%; 95% confidence interval, 0.01–0.11%) and 1 of 4,172 patients with ischemic cardiovascular disease or hyperlipidemia (0.02% and 95% confidence interval, 0.00–0.15%) were heterozygous for the R3480P mutation in apoB (χ2, p = 0.59). Phenotypic Characteristics of APOB R3480P Heterozygotes in the General Population—Compared with non-carriers in the general population of the same age, sex, and APOE genotype (ϵ33), R3480P and R3480W heterozygosity tended to be associated with lower than average levels of plasma cholesterol, LDL cholesterol (including IDL cholesterol), apoB, triglycerides, VLDL cholesterol, and cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio, and with higher than average HDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol/apoA1 ratio (Table I). None of the R3480P heterozygotes had a family history of hypercholesterolemia or of premature ischemic heart disease, although one subject, a 71-year-old male with type 2 diabetes and hypertension, had a non-fatal myocardial infarction at age 68 (Table I).Table ICharacteristics of subjects heterozygous for R3480P and R3480W compared with non-carriers in the general population of the same age, sex, and apolipoprotein E genotypeR3480PR3480W, n = 1Non-carriersn = 4n = 4n = 4n = 4n = 42n = 53n = 55n = 61n = 13Proband12345Sex (Female(F)/male (M))MFMMFMFMMFAge (years)51697071855169707185Cholesterol (mmol/liter)3.9 (1%)6.1 (28%)5.2 (19%)6.0 (45%)5.4 (15%)6.0 (3.9-8.1)6.5 (4.6-9.8)6.3 (3.3-9.9)6.2 (3.3-8.8)7.1 (6.1-18.2)LDL cholesterol (mmol/liter)1.9 (3%)3.5 (25%)2.7 (11%)3.2 (27%)3.0 (16%)3.6 (1.8-5.7)4.0 (2.1-6.8)3.9 (1.0-6.8)3.9 (0.2-6.5)4.8 (3.8-5.9)ApoB (mg/dl)51 (3%)70 (15%)69 (15%)76 (23%)83 (32%)86 (51-130)90 (61-140)91 (27-138)89 (44-130)100 (89-116)HDL cholesterol (mmol/liter)1.4 (56%)2.2 (84%)1.9 (86%)2.2 (95%)2.1 (80%)1.5 (0.8-3.1)1.7 (0.9-2.9)1.5 (0.8-3.3)1.4 (0.8-3.1)1.5 (1.1-2.0)ApoA1 (mg/dl)121 (35%)168 (71%)141 (64%)164 (86%)135 (94-194)153 (100-212)138 (78-213)133 (93-219)146 (124-183)Triglycerides (mmol/liter)1.3 (33%)0.9 (8%)1.4 (34%)1.4 (34%)0.92 (7%)2.1 (0.5-7.4)1.9 (0.8-6.4)2.0 (0.6-4.4)2.0 (0.8-11.9)1.8 (0.7-2.9)VLDL cholesterol (mmol/liter)0.57 (29%)0.41 (9%)0.63 (33%)0.59 (26%)0.42 (6%)0.84 (0.23-1.63)0.82 (0.34-2.20)0.87 (0.28-2.00)0.83 (0.35-5.42)0.81 (0.33-1.29)Cholesterol/HDL cholesterol2.8 (10%)2.8 (13%)2.7 (6%)2.7 (6%)2.6 (7%)4.4 (2.0-10.0)4.1 (2.2-7.5)4.7 (1.7-8.3)4.7 (2.1-8.0)4.7 (3.4-5.7)(HDL cholesterol/apoA1) × 1004.5 (77%)5.1 (89%)5.2 (95%)5.2 (95%)1.08 (0.8-1.6)1.10 (0.6-1.5)1.07 (0.8-1.6)1.07 (0.6-1.6)1.06 (0.8-1.3)Lipoprotein(a) (mg/dl)48.5 (80%)34.1 (67%)13.9 (4%)0.4 (7%)22.9 (0-82.8)32.1 (0-139.4)31.0 (0.4-120.5)36.9 (0-172.2)50.3 (5.2-112.5)ApoE genotypeϵ33ϵ33ϵ33ϵ33ϵ33ϵ33ϵ33ϵ33ϵ33ϵ33Symptoms of IHDNoNoNoMINo5%5%12%15%15%Age at onset of IHD symptoms68Family history of IHD<60 years of age, HC, or bothNoNoNoNoNo Open table in a new tab Because all continuous characteristics were measured simultaneously in all participants of the Copenhagen City Heart Study, it was possible to assign each proband to a percentile in the relevant 10-year age group by sex and APOE genotype (Table I; Fig. 1), thus controlling for well known effects of age, sex, and APOE genotype on lipid and lipoprotein levels. Heterozygosity for R3480P was associated with significantly lower total cholesterol (mean percentile, 23rd; 95% confidence interval, 0–52nd percentile, p = 0.05), LDL cholesterol (16th percentile; 0–35th percentile; p = 0.03), apoB (14th percentile; 0–27th percentile, p = 0.02), and cholesterol/HDL cholesterol (9th percentile; 4–14th percentile, p = 0.005), compared with non-carriers in the general population of the same age, sex, and APOE genotype (Fig. 1). R3480P heterozygosity was associated with increased HDL cholesterol (80th percentile; 53–100th percentile; p = 0.06) and HDL cholesterol/apoAI (89th percentile; 75–100th percentile; p = 0.008) compared with non-carriers in the general population. A single R3480W heterozygote had percentile values for these variables similar to those for R3480P heterozygotes (Table I). Triglycerides, VLDL cholesterol, and age (Fig. 1), as well as lipoprotein(a), fibrinogen, glucose, body-mass index, and ratio of waist to hip circumference did not differ between R3480P heterozygotes and non-carriers in the general population (data not shown). Sex distribution, smoking habits, frequencies of ischemic heart disease, hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, ischemic stroke, xanthelasmata, arcus corneae, and diabetes mellitus also did not differ between R3480P heterozygotes and non-carriers in the general population (data not shown). The R3480P mutation was associated with average decreases in levels of LDL cholesterol, apoB, triglycerides, VLDL cholesterol, and ratio of cholesterol/HDL cholesterol of 1.1 mmol/liter, 24 mg/dl, 0.4 mmol/liter, 0.2 mmol/liter, and 1.6, respectively, and with average increases in levels of HDL cholesterol, and the ratio of (HDL cholesterol/apoAI) × 10, of 0.5 mmol/liter and 0.9 (Table II), when compared with individuals in the general population of the same age (in 10-year age groups), sex, and APOE genotype (ϵ33).Table IIAverage change in lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins in subjects heterozygous for R3480P versus non-carriers in the general populationMean change (n = 4)Rangep valueCholesterol (mmol/liter)-1.0-2.2 to -0.20.10LDL cholesterol (mmol/liter)-1.1-1.9 to -0.60.03Apolipoprotein B (mg/dl)-24-39 to -130.02HDL cholesterol (mmol/liter)0.50.10 to 0.800.05Triglycerides (mmol/liter)-0.4-0.67 to -0.310.02VLDL cholesterol (mmol/liter)-0.2-0.30 to -0.150.01Cholesterol/HDL cholesterol-1.6-1.2 to -1.80.002(HDL cholesterol/apoAI) × 100.90.5 to 1.20.01 Open table in a new tab Lipoprotein Fractions Separated by Ultracentrifugation— R3480P heterozygosity (n = 3) was associated with decreased cholesterol content in VLDL and IDL fractions when compared with non-carriers (n = 30) of the same age (in 10-year age groups), sex, and APOE genotype (ϵ33) (median VLDL cholesterol 0.1 mmol/liter (range, 0.1–0.2) and IDL 0.1 mmol/liter (0.0–0.1) versus VLDL 0.3 mmol/liter (0.1–1.0) and IDL 0.3 mmol/liter (0.1–0.5); p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively), whereas there was a trend toward an association with lower LDL cholesterol levels (p = 0.12). R3480P heterozygosity was not associated with differences in HDL cholesterol levels between the two groups (p = 0.51). R3480P heterozygosity was associated with decreases in triglycerides in plasma compared with non-carriers (0.7 mmol/liter (0.6–0.9) versus 1.3 mmol/liter (0.6–2.6); p = 0.008) as well as with decreases in triglycerides in VLDL, IDL, LDL, and HDL fractions (p = 0.004 to p = 0.05). Finally, R3480P heterozygosity was associated with decreases in plasma apoB and phospholipids compared with non-carriers (apoB, 77 mg/dl (71–93) versus 113 mg/dl (69–174), and phospholipids, 1.7 mmol/liter (1.6–2.5) versus 3.0 mmol/liter (2.5–4.0); p = 0.004 and p = 0.001, respectively). LDL Particle Size and Size of ApoB—Particle diameters of the isolated LDL were similar in R3480P heterozygotes and non-carriers (median 24.5 nm (n = 3; range, 19.4–29.6) versus 24.2 nm (n = 44; range, 24.1–24.3), p = 0.61). Separation of delipidated apoB (from the LDL, IDL, and VLDL fractions obtained by ultracentrifugation) on a 7% acrylamide SDS-polyacrylamide gel showed no differences between R3480P heterozygotes and non-carrier apoB, indicating that the R3480P mutation was not associated with truncated forms of apoB. LDL Competitive Receptor Binding Assay—The ability of R3480P LDL to compete with 125I-labeled non-carrier LDL for binding to normal human fibroblasts was impaired compared with non-carrier LDL (Fig. 2). A 50% displacement of 125I-labeled non-carrier LDL from human fibroblasts required 7.9 μg of R3480P LDL protein per ml compared with 4.6 μg of non-carrier LDL protein/ml. LDL Turnover Studies—Plasma decay curves of R3480P LDL (n = 4) and non-carrier LDL (n = 4) (Figs. 3 and 4) determined simultaneously in humans (n = 4) or in rabbits (n = 3) demonstrated that R3480P LDL is metabolized more slowly than non-carrier LDL in both humans with low LDL receptor activity and in rabbits with high receptor activity (Fig. 3). In accordance with this, fractional catabolic rate of R3480P LDL was on average decreased by 23% compared with non-carrier LDL in humans (Table III). Furthermore, because plasma LDL levels were reduced in R3480P heterozygotes compared with non-carriers in the general population (Table I, Fig. 1, and Table II), LDL production rate was reduced by 29% in R348"
