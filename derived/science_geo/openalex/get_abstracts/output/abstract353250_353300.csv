https://openalex.org/W1905539406,"When electrons are subject to a large external magnetic field, the conventional charge quantum Hall effect dictates that an electronic excitation gap is generated in the sample bulk, but metallic conduction is permitted at the boundary. Recent theoretical models suggest that certain bulk insulators with large spin-orbit interactions may also naturally support conducting topological boundary states in the quantum limit, which opens up the possibility for studying unusual quantum Hall-like phenomena in zero external magnetic fields. Bulk Bi(1-x)Sb(x) single crystals are predicted to be prime candidates for one such unusual Hall phase of matter known as the topological insulator. The hallmark of a topological insulator is the existence of metallic surface states that are higher-dimensional analogues of the edge states that characterize a quantum spin Hall insulator. In addition to its interesting boundary states, the bulk of Bi(1-x)Sb(x) is predicted to exhibit three-dimensional Dirac particles, another topic of heightened current interest following the new findings in two-dimensional graphene and charge quantum Hall fractionalization observed in pure bismuth. However, despite numerous transport and magnetic measurements on the Bi(1-x)Sb(x) family since the 1960s, no direct evidence of either topological Hall states or bulk Dirac particles has been found. Here, using incident-photon-energy-modulated angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (IPEM-ARPES), we report the direct observation of massive Dirac particles in the bulk of Bi(0.9)Sb(0.1), locate the Kramers points at the sample's boundary and provide a comprehensive mapping of the Dirac insulator's gapless surface electron bands. These findings taken together suggest that the observed surface state on the boundary of the bulk insulator is a realization of the 'topological metal'. They also suggest that this material has potential application in developing next-generation quantum computing devices that may incorporate 'light-like' bulk carriers and spin-textured surface currents."

https://openalex.org/W2162121911,"Several lines of evidence have hinted at a possible connection between two evolutionarily ancient cellular defence mechanisms — innate immunity and the hypoxic response. Now that link has been clearly demonstrated with the discovery that a single protein is essential to both responses. The cellular response to hypoxia is triggered by low oxygen levels and controlled by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). The new work shows that HIF-1α transcription is regulated by the transcription factor NF-κB — more usually encountered as the master regulator of the innate immune response. The cellular response to hypoxia is regulated by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. This paper shows that HIF-1α transcription is regulated by basal IKK-β-dependent NF-κB signalling, thus linking the hypoxic response to innate immunity and inflammation. The hypoxic response is an ancient stress response triggered by low ambient oxygen (O2) (ref. 1) and controlled by hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1), whose α subunit is rapidly degraded under normoxia but stabilized when O2-dependent prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) that target its O2-dependent degradation domain are inhibited2,3,4. Thus, the amount of HIF-1α, which controls genes involved in energy metabolism and angiogenesis, is regulated post-translationally. Another ancient stress response is the innate immune response, regulated by several transcription factors, among which NF-κB plays a central role5,6. NF-κB activation is controlled by IκB kinases (IKK), mainly IKK-β, needed for phosphorylation-induced degradation of IκB inhibitors in response to infection and inflammation7. IKK-β is modestly activated in hypoxic cell cultures when PHDs that attenuate its activation are inhibited8. However, defining the relationship between NF-κB and HIF-1α has proven elusive. Using in vitro systems, it was reported that HIF-1α activates NF-κB9, that NF-κB controls HIF-1α transcription10 and that HIF-1α activation may be concurrent with inhibition of NF-κB11. Here we show, with the use of mice lacking IKK-β in different cell types, that NF-κB is a critical transcriptional activator of HIF-1α and that basal NF-κB activity is required for HIF-1α protein accumulation under hypoxia in cultured cells and in the liver and brain of hypoxic animals. IKK-β deficiency results in defective induction of HIF-1α target genes including vascular endothelial growth factor. IKK-β is also essential for HIF-1α accumulation in macrophages experiencing a bacterial infection. Hence, IKK-β is an important physiological contributor to the hypoxic response, linking it to innate immunity and inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W2101021876,"In the early 1990s an outbreak of papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) in the papaya groves in the Puna district of Hawaii caused severe damage to an important crop. Since then, the planting of two transgenic cultivars resistant to the virus — called 'SunUp' and 'Rainbow' — has helped to maintain yields. SunUp is a transgenic red-fleshed fruit that expresses the coat protein gene of a mild mutant of PRSV, conferring resistance via post-transcriptional gene silencing. Rainbow is a yellow-fleshed (and therefore more popular) F1 hybrid bred from SunUp. Now the draft genome sequence of the SunUp strain of papaya has been determined — a first for a commercial virus-resistant transgenic fruit tree. Comparison of this plant genome to those of Arabidopsis and others sheds light on the evolution of qualities such as biosynthesis, starch deposition, control of photosynthesis and pathways for creating the volatile compounds that contribute to the characteristic flavour of papaya. On the cover, the disease-free transgenic Rainbow and the severely infected, stunted and dying non-transgenic Sunrise grow in adjoining plots. Researchers from Hawaii and an international consortium have produced a draft genome assembly for 'SunUp', the first commercial virus-resistant transgenic fruit tree. Comparison of this plant genome to those of Arabidopsis and others sheds light on evolution of characteristics such as biosynthesis, starch deposition, control of photosynthesis and pathways for creating volatile compounds. Papaya, a fruit crop cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions, is known for its nutritional benefits and medicinal applications. Here we report a 3× draft genome sequence of ‘SunUp’ papaya, the first commercial virus-resistant transgenic fruit tree1 to be sequenced. The papaya genome is three times the size of the Arabidopsis genome, but contains fewer genes, including significantly fewer disease-resistance gene analogues. Comparison of the five sequenced genomes suggests a minimal angiosperm gene set of 13,311. A lack of recent genome duplication, atypical of other angiosperm genomes sequenced so far2,3,4,5, may account for the smaller papaya gene number in most functional groups. Nonetheless, striking amplifications in gene number within particular functional groups suggest roles in the evolution of tree-like habit, deposition and remobilization of starch reserves, attraction of seed dispersal agents, and adaptation to tropical daylengths. Transgenesis at three locations is closely associated with chloroplast insertions into the nuclear genome, and with topoisomerase I recognition sites. Papaya offers numerous advantages as a system for fruit-tree functional genomics, and this draft genome sequence provides the foundation for revealing the basis of Carica’s distinguishing morpho-physiological, medicinal and nutritional properties."
https://openalex.org/W2022197238,"Rod and cone photoreceptors detect light and relay this information through a multisynaptic pathway to the brain by means of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). These retinal outputs support not only pattern vision but also non-image-forming (NIF) functions, which include circadian photoentrainment and pupillary light reflex (PLR). In mammals, NIF functions are mediated by rods, cones and the melanopsin-containing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Rod-cone photoreceptors and ipRGCs are complementary in signalling light intensity for NIF functions. The ipRGCs, in addition to being directly photosensitive, also receive synaptic input from rod-cone networks. To determine how the ipRGCs relay rod-cone light information for both image-forming and non-image-forming functions, we genetically ablated ipRGCs in mice. Here we show that animals lacking ipRGCs retain pattern vision but have deficits in both PLR and circadian photoentrainment that are more extensive than those observed in melanopsin knockouts. The defects in PLR and photoentrainment resemble those observed in animals that lack phototransduction in all three photoreceptor classes. These results indicate that light signals for irradiance detection are dissociated from pattern vision at the retinal ganglion cell level, and animals that cannot detect light for NIF functions are still capable of image formation."
https://openalex.org/W2110164985,"Blazars are the most extreme active galactic nuclei. They possess oppositely directed plasma jets emanating at near light speeds from accreting supermassive black holes. According to theoretical models, such jets are propelled by magnetic fields twisted by differential rotation of the black hole's accretion disk or inertial-frame-dragging ergosphere. The flow velocity increases outward along the jet in an acceleration and collimation zone containing a coiled magnetic field. Detailed observations of outbursts of electromagnetic radiation, for which blazars are famous, can potentially probe the zone. It has hitherto not been possible to either specify the location of the outbursts or verify the general picture of jet formation. Here we report sequences of high-resolution radio images and optical polarization measurements of the blazar BL Lacertae. The data reveal a bright feature in the jet that causes a double flare of radiation from optical frequencies to TeV gamma-ray energies, as well as a delayed outburst at radio wavelengths. We conclude that the event starts in a region with a helical magnetic field that we identify with the acceleration and collimation zone predicted by the theories. The feature brightens again when it crosses a standing shock wave corresponding to the bright 'core' seen on the images."

Here we describe a cation-conducting channelrhodopsin (VChR1) from Volvox carteri that can drive spiking at 589 nm, with excitation maximum red-shifted approximately 70 nm compared with ChR2. These results demonstrate fast photostimulation with yellow light, thereby defining a functionally distinct third category of microbial rhodopsin proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1994321505,"The dynamic ability of neuronal dendrites to shape and integrate synaptic responses is the hallmark of information processing in the brain. Effectively studying this phenomenon requires concurrent measurements at multiple sites on live neurons. Substantial progress has been made by optical imaging systems that combine confocal and multiphoton microscopy with inertia-free laser scanning. However, all of the systems developed so far restrict fast imaging to two dimensions. This severely limits the extent to which neurons can be studied, as they represent complex three-dimensional structures. Here we present a new imaging system that utilizes a unique arrangement of acousto-optic deflectors to steer a focused, ultra-fast laser beam to arbitrary locations in three-dimensional space without moving the objective lens. As we demonstrate, this highly versatile random-access multiphoton microscope supports functional imaging of complex three-dimensional cellular structures such as neuronal dendrites or neural populations at acquisition rates on the order of tens of kilohertz."
https://openalex.org/W1984516599,"Escherichia coli AlkB and its human homologues ABH2 and ABH3 repair DNA/RNA base lesions by using a direct oxidative dealkylation mechanism. ABH2 has the primary role of guarding mammalian genomes against 1-meA damage by repairing this lesion in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), whereas AlkB and ABH3 preferentially repair single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) lesions and can repair damaged bases in RNA. Here we show the first crystal structures of AlkB-dsDNA and ABH2-dsDNA complexes, stabilized by a chemical cross-linking strategy. This study reveals that AlkB uses an unprecedented base-flipping mechanism to access the damaged base: it squeezes together the two bases flanking the flipped-out one to maintain the base stack, explaining the preference of AlkB for repairing ssDNA lesions over dsDNA ones. In addition, the first crystal structure of ABH2, presented here, provides a structural basis for designing inhibitors of this human DNA repair protein."

ABL kinase is an important drug target in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Here, we present the first characterization of ABL kinase in complex with three clinical inhibitors (imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib) by modern solution NMR techniques. Structural and dynamical results were derived from complete backbone resonance assignments, experimental residual dipolar couplings, and 15N relaxation data. Residual dipolar coupling data on the imatinib and nilotinib complexes show that the activation loop adopts the inactive conformation, whereas the dasatinib complex preserves the active conformation, which does not support contrary predictions based upon molecular modeling. Nanosecond as well as microsecond dynamics can be detected for certain residues in the activation loop in the inactive and active conformation complexes.

In BCR-ABL, the breakpoint cluster region BCR protein replaces the N-terminal autoregulatory domain of the Abelson ABL protein to give a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase, which deregulates signal transduction pathways, causing uncontrolled proliferation and impaired differentiation of progenitor cells. X-ray crystallography has revealed various active and inactive conformational states of kinases, which are implicated in their regulation and modulation by inhibitors (3Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). The active states are characterized by certain conformations of the activation loop, phosphate-binding loop (P-loop), and helix C, which orient the catalytic machinery to phosphorylate substrates; in the inactive states, one or more of these elements are in different conformations, such that substrate binding and/or catalysis cannot occur. An important determinant is the orientation of the conserved Asp-Phe-Gly motif within the activation loop. For efficient catalysis, this motif adopts a “DFG-in” conformation. In contrast, the “DFG-out” conformation has this motif displaced from the orientation needed for binding the substrate ATP to phosphorylate and activate downstream signaling proteins. Such a DFG-out conformation has been observed in many inactive kinases, including ABL, IRK, KIT, and FLT3 tyrosine kinases (4Mol C.D. Dougan D.R. Schneider T.R. Skene R.J. Kraus M.L. Scheibe D.N.

Inhibitor (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, PD180970, or AFN941) was added to aliquots of the reaction from 20 mm stock solutions in Me2SO. The ABL complexes were then purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75 HR10/30 column, GE Healthcare) in 20 mm BisTris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 3 mm TCEP (pH 6.5), except for the ABL-PD180970 complex, for which 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mm TCEP (pH 7.6) was used.

Selectively labeled samples of imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and PD180970 complexes (1:1) were prepared as solutions (0.32, 0.32, 0.22, and 0.22 mm respectively) in either 95% H2O and 5% D2O, 20 mm BisTris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 3 mm dithiothreitol or TCEP (pH 6.5) (imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib) or 95% H2O and 5% D2O, 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mm TCEP (pH 7.6) (PD180970). Similar preparations were tested for an ABL-AFN941 complex. However, this complex precipitated even at the low concentration of 0.1 mm, and no NMR data could be acquired. Non-isotropic samples of selectively labeled imatinib and nilotinib (dasatinib) complexes were prepared by adding 30 mg/ml (20 mg/ml) filamentous phage Pf1 (Asla Biotech). NMR Resonance Assignments and Measurement of Residual Dipolar Coupling (RDC) Values—NMR spectra were recorded at 293 K on Bruker DRX 600 MHz (with and without a CryoProbe) and 800 MHz (equipped with a TCI CryoProbe) spectrometers. All spectrometers were equipped with triple-resonance, triple-axis pulsed-field gradient probes. Backbone assignments followed standard triple-resonance strategies with two- and three-dimensional experiments, including HNCO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, and 15N-edited 1H-1H nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopy. All NMR data were processed using the NMRPipe suite of programs (29Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar) and analyzed with NMRView (30Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar) to obtain assignments. RDCs were obtained as differences in the splitting observed in the two-dimensional 1H-15N in-phase anti-phase experiments (31Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar) under anisotropic and isotropic conditions. NMR Relaxation Experiments and Analysis—Standard 15N relaxation measurements (T1/T2, {1H}-15 N NOE) were recorded on the ABL-imatinib complex (uniformly and selectively labeled samples) at 800 MHz. T1/T2 decay curves were fitted by an in-house written routine implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc.) using a simplex search minimization and Monte Carlo estimation of errors (see Fig. 7, A and B). Lipari-Szabo model-free analysis of 15N relaxation data was achieved using the TENSOR2 suite of programs (supplemental Fig. 1) (32Dosset P. Hus J.C. Blackledge M. Marion D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Resonance Assignment of the ABL-Imatinib Complex—Assignment of backbone NMR resonances was initially performed for the ABL kinase domain (GAMDP-Ser229-Ser500, human ABL1, isoform 1A, 32 kDa) in its non-phosphorylated form and in complex with imatinib. We have shown previously that efficient production of well folded ABL with uniform 13C/15N isotope labeling is possible by the baculovirus Sf9 insect cell expression system (26Strauss A. Bitsch F. Fendrich G. Graff P. Knecht R. Meyhack B. Jahnke W. J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 31: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). NMR analysis of the ABL complex was difficult for two reasons. 1) Because of solubility problems, ABL concentrations in the NMR samples had to be less than ∼0.4 mm. 2) The assignment had to be carried out using protonated protein because cost-effective deuterium labeling is currently not possible in the insect cell system. Consequently, the short transverse relaxation times of the 32-kDa complex allowed only HNCO, HNCA, HNCOCA, and 15N-edited NOE spectroscopy backbone assignment experiments and prevented the use of CBCA-type experiments, which would have yielded distinctive amino acid-type information (33Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 3: 185-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Supplemental information about amino acid types was therefore obtained from a total of 15 additional, selectively labeled ABL samples. Further details on these samples and the obtained chemical shifts are described elsewhere (34Vajpai N. Strauss A. Fendrich G. Cowan-Jacob S.W. Manley P.W. Jahnke W. Grzesiek S. Biomol. NMR Assign. 2008; 10.1007/s12104-008-9079-7PubMed Google Scholar). The available assignments comprise 96% of all backbone 1HN, 15N, 13Cα, and 13CO resonances, covering 254 of the 264 non-proline residues (Fig. 2). Unassigned residues consist of the N-terminal glycine, several residues within the activation loop, and His361 lining the imatinib-binding surface. Line broadening of adjacent residues indicates that most of the missing residues are broadened beyond detection because of intermediate conformational exchange. Design of Isotope Labeling Scheme for the Study of Various Inhibitor Complexes—After fully assigning the resonances of the ABL-imatinib complex, a strategy employing selective amino acid labeling was devised for the rapid and unambiguous resonance assignment of key residues in the other inhibitor complexes. To select the best suited labeling scheme, residual 1H-15N dipolar couplings were predicted based upon the crystal structures of the various inhibitor complexes and the orientation tensor of the ABL-imatinib complex measured in Pf1 phages (35Hansen M.R. Mueller L. Pardi A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Residues for selective labeling were then chosen to maximize the differences of the predicted dipolar couplings in the “inactive” DFG-out and “active” DFG-in conformations. Thus, maximal experimental differentiation by RDC data between these two conformations should be achieved. The chosen labeling scheme (FGMY) consists of uniform 13C/15N labeling for Phe, Gly, Met, and Tyr and specific 13CO labeling for Thr and Leu residues. FGMY labeling covers five residues (Gly249, Gly250, Gly251, Tyr253, and Gly254) in the P-loop and seven key residues (Phe382, Gly383, Ser385, Met388, Gly390, Tyr393, and Gly398) in the activation loop, with the Ser labeling being the consequence of metabolic scrambling of isotope-labeled glycine. The most important residues (Gly249, Met388, and Tyr393) are preceded by 13CO-labeled Leu or Thr such that they are distinctively detectable in an HNCO experiment. Besides the amino acid-type information, this selective labeling scheme had the advantage that all key resonances were completely free of overlap. The ultimate assignment of resonances was achieved by a combination of three- and two-dimensional versions of HNCA, HNCO, and HN(CO)CA experiments. Chemical Shift Analysis—The chemical shift of a nucleus is a sensitive probe of its local environment and can therefore serve as a fingerprint for different molecular conformations. Comparison of the HSQC fingerprint spectra of the ABL-inhibitor complexes demonstrates that the two DFG-out complexes (imatinib and nilotinib) possess a high degree of similarity (Fig. 3A), but are very distinct from the dasatinib DFG-in complex (Fig. 3B). The HSQC spectrum of the dasatinib complex has a strong resemblance to that of the PD180970 (DFG-in) complex (not shown), but the differences are larger than those between the two DFG-out complexes as quantified by the average 1H-15N chemical shift differences (Δδave) shown in Fig. 3C. Between imatinib and nilotinib, chemical shift differences larger than 0.1 ppm are detected only for Met290, Phe317, and Gly383, which are in direct contact with the inhibitors. Much stronger differences are observed between the dasatinib and imatinib complexes in the region of the P-loop around Gly250, the hinge region residues Phe317 and Gly321, and the activation loop around Met388. Whereas the residues in the P-loop and hinge region participate in direct interactions with the inhibitor, the affected residues in the activation loop (Met388 and Gly390) are not in direct contact, and hence, their chemical shift changes are in agreement with an allosteric reorientation of the activation loop (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Mapping of largely shifted residues on three-dimensional structures of ABL-inhibitor complexes. Overlaid structures of ABL-inhibitor complexes are shown. A, ABL-imatinib (gray; Protein Data Bank code 1IEP) and ABL-nilotinib (yellow; code 3CS9). The P-loop, activation loop, and inhibitors are colored in blue and green for imatinib and nilotinib complexes, respectively. B, ABL-imatinib (gray; code 1IEP) and ABL-dasatinib (green; code 2GQG, molecule B). The P-loop, activation loop, and inhibitors are colored in blue and yellow for imatinib and dasatinib complexes, respectively.

These can be induced in solution by the weak alignment of biomacromolecules (36Tjandra N. Bax A. Science. 1997; 278: 1111-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar) and provide a measure of the orientation of internuclear vectors with respect to a fixed coordinate system. Thus, the RDC of the amide N-H bond (1DNH) is given as follows: 1DNH=1 DNH,max(P2(cosθ) + η/2sin2θcos2φ), where 1DNH,max is a constant depending on the degree of orientation, P2 is the second Legendre polynomial, η is the rhombicity of the alignment tensor, and θ and φ are polar coordinates of the N-H vector in the principal axis system of the alignment tensor (36Tjandra N. Bax A. Science. 1997; 278: 1111-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). Because RDCs can be measured with high precision, their geometric dependence makes them a powerful tool to study solution conformations and compare them with other structural models such as solid-state x-ray crystal structures. Weak alignment of the selectively labeled ABL-inhibitor complexes was achieved by the addition of filamentous bacteriophage Pf1 (35Hansen M.R. Mueller L. Pardi A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Large 1DNH RDCs (∼30 Hz) were obtained for the imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib complexes, which indicated substantial alignment and allowed for high sensitivity detection. For the PD180970 complex, the spectral quality was insufficient, and several key resonances were unobservable because of intermediate conformational exchange. For the imatinib and nilotinib complexes (DFG-out), the RDC values are strikingly similar throughout the protein (Fig. 5A), implying very similar solution structures and dynamics for both complexes. In marked contrast, RDCs for the dasatinib complex (Fig. 5B) differ substantially from those for the imatinib and nilotinib complexes in both the activation loop and the P-loop. Thus, the solution conformation of the dasatinib complex clearly differs from that of the imatinib and nilotinib complexes, which corroborates the results of the chemical shift analysis. To characterize the conformations of the activation loop (Asp381-Pro402), P-loop (Lys247-Glu255), and hinge region (Phe317-Leu323) in detail, theoretical RDC values were calculated for each complex. For this, alignment tensors were determined employing a linear fit procedure (37Sass J. Cordier F. Hoffmann A. Cousin A. Omichinski J.G. Lowen H. Grzesiek S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2047-2055Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar) using the respective crystal structures and the measured RDCs, but excluding the activation loop, P-loop, hinge region, and the flexible residues at the N terminus (<Met237) and C terminus (>Phe493). Using these alignment tensors together with the crystal coordinates, RDC values were predicted for the entire protein, with the previously excluded regions included. These theoretical values were then compared with the experimental RDC values for the imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib complexes (Fig. 6). For the imatinib and nilotinib complexes (Fig. 6, A and B), it is evident that, besides the flexible N-terminal region, all RDC values throughout the entire protein including the loop regions are in perfect agreement with the crystal structures. In particular, this is the case for Phe382, Gly383, Ser385, Met388, Gly390, Tyr393, and Gly398 in the activation loop. This demonstrates that the ABL-imatinib and ABL-nilotinib complexes adopt the inactive DFG-out conformation in solution and that any dynamic variations from the crystal structure coordinates must be small. Taking into account the slightly larger experimental errors for the dasatinib complex, the agreement between measured RDC values and those predicted from the crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 2GQG) is also very good for this complex. The asymmetric unit of the crystal structure 2GQG contains two ABL molecules, one in the phosphorylated form (molecule A; phospho-Tyr393) and one in the non-phosphorylated form (molecule B). Both structures have almost identical backbone conformations. Predictions are shown in Fig. 6C for the non-phosphorylated form because the ABL protein used for solution NMR was also non-phosphorylated. Besides the flexible N and C termini, moderate deviations between measured and predicted RDCs outside of the experimental error are observed only for turn residues Gly250"
https://openalex.org/W2075008638,"The cellular machinery promoting phagocytosis of corpses of apoptotic cells is well conserved from worms to mammals. An important component is the Caenorhabditis elegans engulfment receptor CED-1 (ref. 1) and its Drosophila orthologue, Draper. The CED-1/Draper signalling pathway is also essential for the phagocytosis of other types of 'modified self' including necrotic cells, developmentally pruned axons and dendrites, and axons undergoing Wallerian degeneration. Here we show that Drosophila Shark, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase similar to mammalian Syk and Zap-70, binds Draper through an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in the Draper intracellular domain. We show that Shark activity is essential for Draper-mediated signalling events in vivo, including the recruitment of glial membranes to severed axons and the phagocytosis of axonal debris and neuronal cell corpses by glia. We also show that the Src family kinase (SFK) Src42A can markedly increase Draper phosphorylation and is essential for glial phagocytic activity. We propose that ligand-dependent Draper receptor activation initiates the Src42A-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Draper, the association of Shark and the activation of the Draper pathway. These Draper-Src42A-Shark interactions are strikingly similar to mammalian immunoreceptor-SFK-Syk signalling events in mammalian myeloid and lymphoid cells. Thus, Draper seems to be an ancient immunoreceptor with an extracellular domain tuned to modified self, and an intracellular domain promoting phagocytosis through an ITAM-domain-SFK-Syk-mediated signalling cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1983930854,"The zinc-dependent disintegrin metalloproteinases (a disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) have been implicated in several disease processes, including human cancer. Previously, we demonstrated that the expression of a catalytically active member of the ADAM family, ADAM15, is associated with the progression of prostate and breast cancer. The accumulation of the soluble ectodomain of E-cadherin in human serum has also been associated with the progression of prostate and breast cancer and is thought to be mediated by metalloproteinase shedding. Utilizing two complementary models, overexpression and stable short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of ADAM15 in breast cancer cells, we demonstrated that ADAM15 cleaves E-cadherin in response to growth factor deprivation. We also demonstrated that the extracellular shedding of E-cadherin was abrogated by a metalloproteinase inhibitor and through the introduction of a catalytically inactive mutation in ADAM15. We have made the novel observation that this soluble E-cadherin fragment was found in complex with the HER2 and HER3 receptors in breast cancer cells. These interactions appeared to stabilize HER2 heterodimerization with HER3 and induced receptor activation and signaling through the Erk pathway, supporting both cell migration and proliferation. In this study, we provide evidence that ADAM15 catalyzes the cleavage of E-cadherin to generate a soluble fragment that in turn binds to and stimulates ErbB receptor signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2099361127,"Staphylococcal immunoglobulin-binding protein, Sbi, is a 436-residue protein produced by many strains of Staphylococcus aureus. It was previously characterized as being cell surface-associated and having binding capacity for human IgG and β2-glycoprotein I. Here we show using small angle x-ray scattering that the proposed extracellular region of Sbi (Sbi-E) is an elongated molecule consisting of four globular domains, two immunoglobulin-binding domains (I and II) and two novel domains (III and IV). We further show that together domains III and IV (Sbi-III-IV), as well as domain IV on its own (Sbi-IV), bind complement component C3 via contacts involving both the C3dg fragment and the C3a anaphylatoxin domain. Preincubation of human serum with either Sbi-E or Sbi-III-IV is inhibitory to all complement pathways, whereas domain IV specifically inhibits the alternative pathway. Monitoring C3 activation in serum incubated with Sbi fragments reveals that Sbi-E and Sbi-III-IV both activate the alternative pathway, leading to consumption of C3. By contrast, inhibition of this pathway by Sbi-IV does not involve C3 consumption. The observation that Sbi-E activates the alternative pathway is counterintuitive to intact Sbi being cell wall-associated, as recruiting complement to the surface of S. aureus would be deleterious to the bacterium. Upon re-examination of this issue, we found that Sbi was not associated with the cell wall fraction, but rather was found in the growth medium, consistent with it being an excreted protein. As such, our data suggest that Sbi helps mediate bacterial evasion of complement via a novel mechanism, namely futile fluid-phase consumption.

The human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus produces an arsenal of virulence factors that aid the organism in effectively evading the immune system of the host. The ability of S. aureus to evade the adaptive immune response of the host has long been recognized (1Foster T.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Staphylococcal cell wall-associated protein A (SpA), 7The abbreviations used are: SpA, Staphylococcus protein A; Sbi, Staphylococcus aureus binder of immunoglobulin; Efb, extracellular fibrinogen-binding molecule; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering; CP, classical pathway; MBLP, mannose-binding lectin pathway; AP, alternative pathway; RU, response units; CR, complement receptor; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; NHS, N-hydroxysuccinimide; β2-GPI, β2-glycoprotein I. for instance, binds immunoglobulin G Fc fragment, and it interacts with certain Fab fragments, thus characterizing SpA as a B-cell superantigen (2Sasso E.H.

Transfusion (Bethesda). 2005; 45: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The Fc binding capacity of SpA has also been found to counteract the innate immune defenses of the host by interfering with the activation of the classical pathway of the complement system (4Goward C.R. Scawen M.D. Murphy J.P. Atkinson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 136-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). More recently a group of small excreted proteins has been discovered that also aid S. aureus in evading complement-mediated bacterial clearance (5Lee L.Y. Liang X. Hook M. Brown E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50710-50716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 6de Haas C.J. Veldkamp K.E. Peschel A. Weerkamp F. Van Wamel W.J. Heezius E.C. Poppelier M.J.

Immunol. 2005; 174: 2926-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The discovery of new evasion molecules, and understanding the molecular basis of the mode of action of these molecules, not only leads to a better knowledge of their role in the pathophysiology of bacterial infections but is also the first step in their possible exploitation as anti-inflammatory disease therapeutics. In addition to SpA, a second staphylococcal immunoglobulin-binding protein, Sbi, has been identified (9Zhang L. Jacobsson K. Vasi J. Lindberg M. Frykberg L. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) that occurs in many S. aureus strains (including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains). Sbi is a 436-amino acid protein that contains one functional immunoglobulin-binding domain and a second predicted immunoglobulin-binding motif, both with sequence similarity to the five immunoglobulin-binding repeats (E, A, B, C, and D) of SpA (see Fig. 1a) but no other significant sequence similarity to known proteins. Recently it was shown that the second predicted immunoglobulin-binding motif of Sbi is indeed a functional IgG-binding domain and that, in contrast to SpA, Sbi only interacts with the IgG Fc fragment (10Atkins K.L. Burman J.D. Chamberlain E.S. Cooper J.E. Poutrel B. Bagby B. Jenkins A.T.A. Feil E.J. van den Elsen J.M.H. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 46: 1600-1611Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Unlike SpA, Sbi lacks the typical Gram-positive cell wall anchoring sequence LPXTG, but it does have a predicted proline-rich cell wall-spanning segment (9Zhang L. Jacobsson K. Vasi J. Lindberg M. Frykberg L. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It has further been suggested that Sbi is associated with the bacterial surface through electrostatic interactions (9Zhang L. Jacobsson K. Vasi J. Lindberg M. Frykberg L. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Finally, Sbi has been shown to bind another plasma component, adhesion protein β2-glycoprotein I (β2-GPI), a protein that has been implicated in blood coagulation (11Zhang L. Jacobsson K. Strom K. Lindberg M. Frykberg L. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12Bouma B. de Groot P.G. van den Elsen J.M. Ravelli R.B. Schouten A. Simmelink M.J. Derksen R.H. Kroon J. Gros P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5166-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Here we reveal the putative extracellular domain organization of Sbi, determine the specific function of the individual domains, and describe the implications for their possible role in the evasion of both adaptive and innate immune systems in humans by S. aureus. To investigate the arrangement of the domains in solution, we cloned, expressed, and purified the proposed extracellular part of Sbi, adjacent to the predicted cell wall-spanning proline-rich repeat region (9Zhang L. Jacobsson K. Vasi J. Lindberg M. Frykberg L. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Sbi-E, residues 28-266, Fig. 1, a and b) and subjected the fragment to small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), a technique well suited to study flexible macromolecules in solution (13Svergun D.I. Koch M.H.J. Rep. Progr. Phys. 2003; 66: 1735-1782Crossref Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Based on the SAXS-derived model, we then engineered five recombinant Sbi fragments, spanning the N-terminal region of the protein (Sbi-I, Sbi-II, Sbi-III-IV, Sbi-III, and Sbi-IV, as shown in Fig. 1b). Human and animal serum proteins that interact with Sbi were identified by affinity pulldown and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and candidates were further investigated in direct binding assays. Follow-up functional assays have revealed a novel mechanism through which Sbi subverts the complement system. Cloning and Expression of Recombinant Sbi Constructs—Six recombinant fragments of the N-terminal region of Sbi (adjacent to the polyproline region) were engineered as follows: Sbi-E (amino acids 28-266), Sbi-I (amino acids 42-94), Sbi-II (amino acids 92-156), Sbi-III-IV (amino acids 150-266), Sbi-III (amino acids 150-205), and Sbi-IV (amino acids 197-266), as shown in Fig. 1b. The Sbi gene constructs were amplified by PCR using S. aureus strain Mu50 genomic DNA as a template. The following oligonucleotide primers were used for Sbi-E, Sbi-I, Sbi-II, Sbi-III-IV, Sbi-III, and Sbi-IV, respectively: 5′-CAT GCC ATG GCG AGT GAA AAC ACG CAA CAA-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CCG CTC GAG TCA TTA CGC CAC TTT CTT TTC AGC-3′ (reverse primer); 5′-CAT GCC ATG GGA ACT CAA AAC AAC TAC GTA ACA-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CCG CTC GAG TCA CTA GCT GTC TTT AAG TGA TTC AGA-3′ (reverse primer); 5′-CAT GCC ATG GAC AGC AAG ACC CCA GAC CGA-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CCG CTC GAG GAG TCA TTA ATT TTC AAT ATT TTG ACG-3′ (reverse primer); 5′-CAT GCC ATG GAA CGT CAA AAT ATT GAA AAT GCG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CCG CTC GAG TCA TTA CGC CAC TTT CTT TTC AGC-3′ (reverse primer); 5′-CAT GCC ATG GAA CGT CAA AAT ATT GAA AAT GCG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CCG CTC GAG TCA TTA AAC GAT TGC TTT TTC AAT TGA-3′ (reverse primer); 5′-CAT GCC ATG GTT TCA ATT GAA AAA GCA ATC GTT-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CCG CTC GAG TCA TTA CGC CAC TTT CTT TTC AGC-3′ (reverse primer). All primers were obtained from MWG Biotech AG. The resulting amplified fragments were subsequently cloned into the pET-based “parallel” vector (14Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) (using the incorporated NcoI (forward primer) and XhoI (reverse primer) restriction sites) producing the constructs psbi-e, psbi-i, psbi-ii, psbi-iii-iv, psbi-iii, and psbi-iv, respectively. Sbi constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli strains BL21(DE3), BL21(DE3)-Star, or Rosetta. Freshly transformed E. coli cells were grown in a shaker at 37 °C in Luria Bertani broth (LB), containing ampicillin, until they reached an extinction of 0.6 at 600 nm. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Melford) was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the cells were incubated at 28 °C for an additional 4 h. Cells from a 1-liter culture were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), and lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 15 min and the supernatant filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. The proteins were purified using nickel-ion chelating chromatography by either applying the filtered supernatant to a Sartobind membrane (Sartorius) or a 1-ml HiTrap column attached to anÄKTA purifier (Amersham Biosciences). Next, the column was washed with binding buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with a buffer containing 1 m imidazole, for the Sartobind purification, or a 0.05-1 m imidazole gradient for the HiTrap purification. Purified protein was dialyzed into a buffer solution, typically 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and stored at -80 °C until use. Protein concentration was determined using a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) and absorbance at 280 nm (A280 0.1% (=1 g/liter): 0.66 for Sbi-E; 1.11 for Sbi-I; 0.80 for Sbi-III-IV; 0.77 for Sbi-III and 0.54 for Sbi-IV). All expressed Sbi constructs have a 25-residue N-terminal tag with sequence MSYHHHHHHDYDIPTTENLYFQGAM, including a 6-histidine purification tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. The three tyrosines residues of the tag contribute to calculated extinction coefficients used. Molecular masses employed for calculating molar concentrations were as follows: Sbi-E, 31000; Sbi-I, 8700; Sbi-II, 11000; Sbi-III, 9000; Sbi-III-IV, 17000; and Sbi-IV, 11000. Exact predicted molecular mass values were confirmed by micro-TOF mass spectrometry analysis as follows: Sbi-E, 30867.1/30735.3; Sbi-I, 9524.4/9392.3; Sbi-II, 10776.6/10645; Sbi-III-IV, 16657.4/16525.9; Sbi-III, 9668.6/9536.2; Sbi-IV, 11074.4/10942.7 (predicted/actual molecular mass), indicating that all constructs missed the first methionine residue. Small Angle X-ray Scattering Experiments and Data Analysis—Synchrotron radiation x-ray scattering data were collected on the X33 beam line at the EMBL, Hamburg Outstation (DORIS III storage ring at DESY). Solutions of Sbi-E were measured on a MAR345 image plate detector at protein concentrations of 2.8, 8.4, and 16.7 mg/ml and sample detector distance of 2.4 m and wavelength λ = 1.5 Å, covering the momentum transfer range 0.013 < s < 0.45 Å-1 (s = 4π sin(θ)/λ where 2θ is the scattering angle). Prior to data collection, dynamic light scattering analysis was used to ensure the monodispersity of the protein samples. To check for radiation damage, two successive 2-min exposures taken on the same sample were compared; no radiation effects were observed. The data were processed using standard procedures and extrapolated to zero solute concentration using the program package PRIMUS (15Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). The forward scattering I(0) and the radius of gyration (Rg) were evaluated using the Guinier approximation (16Guinier A. Ann. Phys. (Paris). 1939; 12: 161-237Google Scholar) assuming that at very small angles (s < 1.3/Rg) the intensity is represented as I(s) = I(0) exp(-(sRg)2/3). These parameters were also computed from the entire scattering patterns using the indirect transform package GNOM (17Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2985) Google Scholar), which also provided the intraparticle distance distribution function (p(r)) and the maximum dimension (Dmax). The molecular mass of the solute was evaluated by comparison of the forward scattering with that from reference solutions of bovine serum albumin (molecular mass = 66 kDa). The low resolution ab initio model of Sbi was constructed using the program DAMMIN (18Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar), which represents the protein by an assembly of densely packed beads. Simulated annealing was employed to build a compact interconnected configuration of beads inside a sphere with the diameter Dmax that fits the experimental data Iexp(s) minimizing the discrepancy (Equation 1), χ2=1N-1∑j(Iexp(sj)-cIcalc(sj)σ(sj))2(Eq. 1) where N is the number of experimental points; c is a scaling factor, and Icalc(sj) and σ(sj) are the calculated intensity and the experimental error at the momentum transfer sj, respectively. A dozen DAMMIN runs were performed to check the stability of solution, and the results were well superimposable with each other. These independent reconstructions were analyzed by the program DAMAVER (19Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1620) Google Scholar) yielding the most probable model (displayed in Fig. 2b). Serum Affinity Pulldown Assay—Purified Sbi-I, Sbi-II, Sbi-III-IV, Sbi-III, and Sbi-IV were each covalently coupled to a 1-ml NHS-activated Sepharose high performance column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After equilibration with phosphate-buffered saline, 5 ml of human serum (Cambrex) and serum from calf, cow, chicken, goat, horse, mouse, rabbit, or sheep (Sigma) was applied to the column. Columns were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and bound proteins were eluted with a 0-1 m NaCl gradient over 10 ml. The binding of serum proteins by bait proteins Sbi-III-IV, Sbi-III, and Sbi-IV was analyzed using SDS-PAGE, using immobilized Sbi-I as a negative control. Size exclusion chromatography, with a Superdex-200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), was used for further purification of the bound fragments. Trypsinized protein fragments from excised gel slices were analyzed by MALDI-TOF. Protein-Lynx software was used for protein identification. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—Complement C3/C3 derivative binding experiments were performed on a BIACore 3000 Instrument (BIACore, Life Sciences), which has four flow cells. Each experiment was run in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 3 mm EDTA, 0.01% surfactant P20 with either physiological salt (150 mm NaCl) or half-physiological salt (75 mm NaCl) at a flow rate of 20 μl/ml. Ligands molecules were covalently coupled to a CM5 sensor chip via standard amino group chemistry (BIACore), with flow cell 1 being the sham-activated and deactivated reference channel. Each experiment consisted of a 60-s analyte injection, followed by a 60-s buffer flow over the surface before the injection loop and flow cell were washed. The sensor chip surface was regenerated between experiments, with a 60-s pulse of 2 m NaCl, which brought the sensorgram signal back to base line. Each injection flowed over all four flow cell surfaces in-series and gave three sets of data (the signal of flow cell 1 being subtracted from the other sensorgrams). Control proteins C4dg, C4b, and bovine serum albumin were used to validate the specificity of C3 binding to the flow cells bearing Sbi-E, Sbi-III-IV, Sbi-III, and Sbi-IV. Affinity constants for C3dg binding to Sbi-E, Sbi-III-IV, and Sbi-IV were determined by fitting the steady-state plateau RU values of a series of C3dg analyte injections to a single-site Langmuir binding isotherm model as shown in Equation 2, ΔRU=ΔRUmax×[analyte]KD+[analyte](Eq. 2) using MacCurvefit version 1.5.5 nonlinear regression software. Inhibition of the interaction between C3dg and CR2 by Sbi-III-IV was probed in saturation experiments with C3dg binding to a sensor chip bearing a recombinant two domain CR2 construct (CCP 1-2), in the absence and presence of a constant concentration (5 μm) of Sbi-III-IV as a C3dg co-analyte. The recombinant CR2 was expressed in bacteria and purified from inclusion bodies analogously to what has been described for human decay accelerating factor (20White J. Lukacik P. Esser D. Steward M. Giddings N. Bright J.R. Fritchley S.J. Morgan B.P. Lea S.M. Smith G.P. Smith R.A. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2406-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), another member of the regulators of complement activation superfamily. Complement components used as analytes were prepared as follows: C3, purified from pooled human plasma (21Hammer C.H. Wirtz G.H. Renfer L. Gresham H.D. Tack B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3995-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was subjected to a final chromatographic step on Mono S FPLC to separate thioester-intact native C3 from thioester-hydrolyzed conformational isoforms (22Pangburn M.K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 102: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). C3b (see supplemental Fig. S1 for chain structures of the various C3 degradation fragments) was generated by limited trypsinization of native C3 (23Isenman D.E. Kells D.I. Cooper N.R. Muller-Eberhard H.J. Pangburn M.K. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4458-4467Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and conversion of C3b to iC3b employed fI (1% w/w), with fH (2% w/w) as the I-cofactor (24Isenman D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4238-4244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To generate C3c, C3b was incubated overnight at 22 °C with fI (1% w/w) and soluble CR1 (2% w/w, a gift from Avant Immunotherapeutics, Needham, MA). Treatment of native C3 with 100 mm CH3NH2 at pH 8 for 6 h at 37 °C yields a thioester carbonyl-derivatized form of C3, denoted as C3(NHCH3), which adopts a C3b-like conformation (23Isenman D.E. Kells D.I. Cooper N.R. Muller-Eberhard H.J. Pangburn M.K. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4458-4467Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Treatment of the latter with fI and fH yields an iC3b-like species, iC3(NHCH3), in which C3a is still present. All of the aforementioned digestion products were purified via chromatography on Mono Q FPLC using previously described elution conditions (25Becherer J.D. Lambris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14586-14591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C3dg and C4Bdg (C4dg of the C4B isotype) were recombinantly produced in E. coli as described previously (26Nagar B. Jones R.G. Diefenbach R.J. Isenman D.E. Rini J.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1277-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 27van den Elsen J.M. Martin A. Wong V. Clemenza L. Rose D.R. Isenman D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 1103-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). C3a was obtained from Calbiochem. All complement proteins used as analytes in SPR experiments were exchanged into the SPR running buffer, and separated from any minor oligomeric species formed during storage, by FPLC gel filtration on Superose 6 (Superdex 200 for C3dg and C4Bdg) within 24 h of use. Complement Activity Assays—The Wielisa total complement system screen (Wieslab), described by Seelen et al. (28Seelen M.A. Roos A. Wieslander J. Mollnes T.E. Sjoholm A.G. Wurzner R. Loos M. Tedesco F. Sim R.B. Garred P. Alexopoulos E. Turner M.W. Daha M.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2005; 296: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), was used to detect inhibition by recombinant fragments Sbi-E, Sbi-I, Sbi-III-IV, Sbi-III, and Sbi-IV of the classical (CP), mannose-binding lectin (MBLP), and alternative (AP) complement pathways. In this enzyme-linked immunosorbent plate-based assay of complement activation, which ultimately immunochemically detects deposition of C5b-9 onto the well, pathway-specific activation is achieved via a combination of coating the wells with pathway-selective activators and specific agents in the dilution buffers (or in the case of the classical pathway the dilution per se), which restrict initiation of complement activation to the single desired pathway. In the initial Sbi fragment screen, 1 μg of each protein was added per 1 μl of human serum (positive control serum, supplied with the kit), and assayed for complement activity after 30 min of preincubation at 37 °C. The assay was completed in duplicate, according to the manufacturer's instructions, and included a blank, a positive control (human serum from healthy individuals), and a negative control (heat-inactivated serum). Complement activity inhibition was quantified from the absorbance at 405 nm using the equation: (sample - negative control)/(positive control - negative control) × 100%. Assay for the Activation State of Serum C3—Purified native C3 was radioiodinated to a specific activity of ∼105 cpm/μg via the lactoperoxidase method (29Marchalonis J.J. Biochem. J. 1969; 113: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar) using the very gentle conditions previously described for the iodination of C1q without loss of C1q functionality (30Wright J.F. Shulman M.J. Isenman D.E. Painter R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11221-11226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 125I-C3 was added to undiluted fresh human serum in the ratio of 1 μl (0.3 μg) of labeled C3 to 5 μl of serum. In the initial screen, various Sbi fragments (2 mg/ml stock) were added to a final concentration of 0.63 mg/ml to aliquots of the 125I-C3-spiked serum, and these were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, at which time EDTA was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the samples were placed on ice. C3 activation that was limited to the alternative pathway was assessed in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA. Here too, complement activation was quenched by the addition of 10 mm EDTA after the incubation period. As a positive control for complement activation, heat-aggregated human IgG (10 mg/ml, 63 °C, 20 min) was added to the 125I-C3-containing serum to a final concentration of 1.4 mg/ml. After incorporation of reducing agent-containing SDS sample buffer at 100 °C for 5 min, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a “conventional” size (1.5-mm thickness, 17 cm (wide) × 14 cm (long)) 8% acrylamide gel and loading the diluted volume equivalent of 1 μl of original serum per lane to minimize gel-distortion artifacts because of very high protein concentration in the albumin region of the gel. Radioactive bands on the fixed and dried down gel were detected by PhosphorImaging. Analysis of Covalent Adducts of 125I-C3—Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis (reducing conditions, 8% acrylamide gel in both dimensions), where the second dimension follows soaking of a lane from the first dimension in 1 m NH2OH at pH 9 to cleave ester linkages, was performed as described previously (31Law S.K. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2701-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), except that detection of radioactive spots was performed by PhosphorImaging. This analysis was performed on a 5-fold scaled-up sample of 125I-C3-containing serum that had been incubated with Sbi-III-IV and then immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Sbi-E antiserum using stringent immunoprecipitation and wash buffer conditions that sacrifice yield for specificity of antigen capture (32Cole F.S. Auerbach H.S. Goldberger G. Colten H.R. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 2610-2616PubMed Google Scholar). Factor I Cofactor Activity Assay—Twenty micrograms of C3(NHCH3) were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C with 0.2 μg of factor I and 2 μg of Sbi-III-IV in a volume of 40 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. This quantity of Sbi-III-IV was in slight stoichiometric excess (1.15:1) relative to the target C3 derivative. Cleavage to iC3(NHCH3) (see supplemental Fig. S1 for chain structure) was assessed on reduced SDS-PAGE via the disappearance of intact α-chain, the appearance of α-40/α-43 fragments, and an increase in the intensity of the β-chain region because of the co-migration of α-76 fragment. Substitution of 0.2 μg of factor H for Sbi-III-IV served as a positive control as quantitative conversion to iC3(NHCH3) occurred using this substoichiometric amount (0.013:1) of cofactor. Cell Fractionation and Western Immunoblot Analysis of Cellular Fractions of S. aureus Newman—Cellular fractions of S. aureus Newman and Newman spa-deficient strains were prepared as described previously (33Downer R. Roche F. Park P.W. Mecham R.P. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 243-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In brief, S. aureus Newman and Newman spa cultures were grown overnight to stationary phase in TSB with aeration (OD 1, A600 nm). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and cell wall proteins were solubilized by incubation with lysostaphin. Protoplasts were recovered by centrifugation, and the supernatant was taken as the wall fraction. Protoplasts were lysed by vortexing and repeated pipetting, and the membrane fraction was obtained by centrifugation followed by washing and resuspension in lysis buffer. The culture supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid on ice and pelleted by centrifugation. All fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit IgG (Dako) at 1:15,000 dilution (140 ng/ml). F(ab′)2 fragments of rabbit polyclonal anti-Sbi-E antibodies (obtained by pepsin digestion, Pierce F(ab′)2 preparation kit) were used at a 1:1,000 dilution followed by goat anti-rabbit (Dako) secondary antibody at recommended dilution (1:2,000) and visualized using the chemiluminescence detection system (Roche Applied Science). Domain Structure of Putative Extracellular Region of Sbi—We investigated the domain organization of the putative extracellular ligand-binding region of Sbi by SAXS using a 31-kDa construct of Sbi (Sbi-E), containing the N-terminal segment adjacent to the proline-rich region. The x-ray scattering curve for Sbi-E (Fig. 2a) yields a molecular mass estimate of 33 ± 3 kDa, indicating that the protein is monomeric in solution. The experimental Rg and the Dmax were 46 ± 1 and 160 ± 10 Å, respectively, exceeding the values expected for a compact globular protein of such molecular mass by nearly a factor of 2. The distance distribution function of Sbi-E (Fig. 2a, inset) has a skewed profile characteristic for elongated particles (13Svergun D.I. Koch M.H.J. Rep. Progr. Phys. 2003; 66: 1735-1782Crossref Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The low resolution shape of Sbi was reconstructed ab initio using the"
https://openalex.org/W2139766266,"Neutrophils depend mainly on glycolysis for their energy provision. Their mitochondria maintain a membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)), which is usually generated by the respiratory chain complexes. We investigated the source of Deltapsi(m) in neutrophils, as compared to peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes and HL-60 cells, and whether neutrophils can still utilise this Deltapsi(m) for the generation of ATP.Individual activity of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes was significantly reduced in neutrophils, except for complex II and V, but Deltapsi(m) was still decreased by inhibition of complex III, confirming the role of the respiratory chain in maintaining Deltapsi(m). Complex V did not maintain Deltapsi(m) by consumption of ATP, as has previously been suggested for eosinophils. We show that complex III in neutrophil mitochondria can receive electrons from glycolysis via the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle. Furthermore, respiratory supercomplexes, which contribute to efficient coupling of the respiratory chain to ATP synthesis, were lacking in neutrophil mitochondria. When HL-60 cells were differentiated to neutrophil-like cells, they lost mitochondrial supercomplex organisation while gaining increased aerobic glycolysis, just like neutrophils.We show that neutrophils can maintain Deltapsi(m) via the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle, whereby their mitochondria play an important role in the regulation of aerobic glycolysis, rather than producing energy themselves. This peculiar mitochondrial phenotype is acquired during differentiation from myeloid precursors."
https://openalex.org/W2060716513,"Although there exists compelling genetic evidence for a homologous recombination-independent pathway for repair of interstrand cross-links (ICLs) involving translesion synthesis (TLS), biochemical support for this model is lacking. To identify DNA polymerases that may function in TLS past ICLs, oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized containing site-specific ICLs in which the linkage was between N2-guanines, similar to cross-links formed by mitomycin C and enals. Here, data are presented that mammalian cell replication of DNAs containing these lesions was ∼97% accurate. Using a series of oligodeoxynucleotides that mimic potential intermediates in ICL repair, we demonstrate that human polymerase (pol) κ not only catalyzed accurate incorporation opposite the cross-linked guanine but also replicated beyond the lesion, thus providing the first biochemical evidence for TLS past an ICL. The efficiency of TLS was greatly enhanced by truncation of both the 5 ′ and 3 ′ ends of the nontemplating strand. Further analyses showed that although yeast Rev1 could incorporate a dCTP opposite the cross-linked guanine, no evidence was found for TLS by pol ζ or a pol ζ/Rev1 combination. Because pol κ was able to bypass these ICLs, biological evidence for a role for pol κ in tolerating the N2-N2-guanine ICLs was sought; both cell survival and chromosomal stability were adversely affected in pol κ-depleted cells following mitomycin C exposure. Thus, biochemical data and cellular studies both suggest a role for pol κ in the processing of N2-N2-guanine ICLs.

Rev. 2007; 31: 109-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition to the classes of exogenous chemicals listed above, various endogenously generated bis-electrophiles, for example products of lipid peroxidation, are also capable of forming ICLs (3Kozekov I.D.

The processing and repair of ICLs in eukaryotic cells are extremely complex, potentially involving multiple DNA repair and damage tolerance pathways, including homologous recombination, nucleotide excision repair, translesion DNA synthesis, transcription-coupled repair, nonhomologous end joining, mismatch repair, cell cycle checkpoints, and ubiquitination/deubiquitination pathways (1Noll D.M.

Rev. 2007; 31: 109-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The complexity of ICL repair and tolerance is further evidenced by data demonstrating that different organisms may preferentially use alternative pathways that are dependent on the stage of the cell cycle in which the ICL is encountered (1Noll D.M.

Although many models for ICL repair require the involvement of homologous recombination, an alternative, recombination-independent pathway exists that utilizes endonucleases for strand incision surrounding the ICL on one of the two DNA strands and TLS polymerases for gap-filling replication past the ICL site on the other strand (4Wang X.

In these repair models, the dually incised strand possesses sufficient mobility that a DNA polymerase can strand displace the nucleotide patch that is 5′ to the lesion, then replicate past the ICL site to complete the repair gap-filling synthesis.

Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Thus, it is highly unlikely that a single polymerase will be responsible for replication bypass of every ICL, because the chemical linkages of ICLs can differ significantly. A common site of ICL formation is between exocyclic amino groups of guanines in a CpG sequence context; this can be mediated by mitomycin C and bifunctional enals, such as acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and 4-hydroxynonenal (1Noll D.M. Mason T.M. Miller P.S. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 277-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 3Kozekov I.D. Nechev L.V. Moseley M.S. Harris C.M. Rizzo C.J. Stone M.P. Harris T.M. J. Am. Chem.

When plasmids containing MMC-induced ICLs were used to measure the fidelity of recombination-independent repair in mammalian cells, the majority of recovered plasmids did not acquire sequence alterations (5Zheng H. Wang X. Warren A.J. Legerski R.J. Nairn R.S. Hamilton J.W. Li L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Additionally, replication of plasmids containing crotonaldehyde-mediated N2-N2-guanine ICLs in human cells revealed that in the absence of homologous recombination, these lesions were primarily repaired in an error-free manner (9Liu X. Lao Y. Yang I.Y. Hecht S.S. Moriya M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12898-12905Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Previous investigations have suggested that replication bypass of N2-guanine monoadducts in eukaryotic cells can be performed by either pol κ (16Zhang Y. Wu X. Guo D. Rechkoblit O. Wang Z.

Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6900-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the latter case, Rev1 inserts the correct nucleotide, C, opposite the lesion, whereas pol ζ extends the primer from such a C. Here we hypothesized that pol κ, Rev1, and pol ζ may also function in replication bypass of N2-N2-guanine ICLs. With synthetic chemical strategies for the construction of oligodeoxynucleotides containing model acrolein-derived site-specific N2-N2-guanine ICLs, we examined the ability of human pol κ, yeast Rev1, and pol ζ to replicate past these lesions (Fig. 1A). Preparation of Oligodeoxynucleotides—Unmodified oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by the Molecular Microbiology and Immunology Research Core Facility, Oregon Health & Science University. Modified oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized as reported previously (22Dooley P.A. Tsarouhtsis D. Korbel G.A. Nechev L.V. Shearer J. Zegar I.S. Harris C.M. Stone M.P. Harris T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 1730-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Dooley P.A. Zhang M. Korbel G.A. Nechev L.V. Harris C.M. Stone M.P. Harris T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 62-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The experimental procedure that summarizes the sequential synthesis steps for ICL formation is shown in supplemental Fig. 1. Detailed descriptions of this procedure, the characterization of ICL-containing products, and the preparation of ICL2 and ICL4 from uracil-containing precursor oligodeoxynucleotides are given in supplemental Methods. Cell Lines—COS-7 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. GM639 human fibroblasts were obtained from NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository. Mutagenesis Assays—Mutagenesis assays were performed using a previously developed pMS2 shuttle vector/COS-7 system (24Moriya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The pMS2 shuttle vector was a gift from Dr. M. Moriya (State University of New York, Stony Brook). In its single-stranded form, the pMS2 vector contains a hairpin loop with an internal EcoRV restriction site. Incorporation of control nondamaged oligodeoxynucleotides into this site was done in the presence of a scaffold DNA according to a published method (25Kanuri M. Minko I.G. Nechev L.V. Harris T.M. Harris C.M. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18257-18265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To create a single-stranded pMS2 containing site-specific interstrand cross-link, the procedure was modified as follows. Oligodeoxynucleotides containing a model acrolein-derived site-specific interstrand cross-link (Fig. 1, A and B) were designed in such a way that peripheral regions of the longer strands (36-mer) were complementary to the vector sequences immediately adjacent to the EcoRV site. A circular single-stranded pMS2 vector (∼15 pmol) was digested with 40 units of EcoRV (New England Biolabs) for 3 h at 37°C to generate a linear DNA. 5′-Phosphorylated cross-linked inserts (60 pmol) were added to the linear single-stranded pMS2 (15 pmol) and ligated using 60 units of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) for 48 h at 4 °C. To obtain double-stranded pMS2 vectors, the 36-mer strand of the cross-link or the scaffold oligodeoxynucleotide in control DNA was extended using 5 units of T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and 1 mm dNTPs at 37 °C for 1 h. A newly synthesized strand was concomitantly sealed using 5 units of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). The creation of double-stranded pMS2 was verified by PstI (New England Biolabs) digestion. Transfection of pMS2 vector into COS-7 cells, isolation of progeny DNA, selection of individual clones by Escherichia coli transformation, and differential hybridization analyses were done as described previously (24Moriya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 25Kanuri M. Minko I.G. Nechev L.V. Harris T.M. Harris C.M. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18257-18265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). DNA Polymerase Bypass Assays—Preparations of primer-template DNA substrates were performed as described previously (26Minko I.G. Washington M.T. Kanuri M. Prakash L. Prakash S. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 784-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Human recombinant pol κ and S. cerevisiae recombinant Rev1 and pol ζ were obtained from Enzymax. Prior to polymerase bypass assays, polymerase preparations were tested for contaminating exonucleolytic activities. Primer-template nondamaged DNA substrate (5 nm) was incubated with each individual polymerase (2 nm) under conditions identical to polymerase reactions but in the absence of dNTPs. No primer degradation was observed after 30 min of incubation at 37 °C. Polymerase bypass assays were performed using 5 nm primer-template DNA substrates in the presence of 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C. Primer extensions were conducted with 100 μm dNTPs. Single nucleotide incorporations were performed with 20 μm of an individual dNTP. Protein concentrations and incubation times are indicated on figures or given in the figure legends. Prior to reactions using a combination of pol ζ and Rev1 proteins (Fig. 5D), pol ζ alone, or in a mixture with Rev1 was preincubated overnight on ice in the presence of 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Polymerase reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of a solution consisting of 95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.2% xylene cyanol. Products were resolved through a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 8 m urea and visualized using a PhosphorImager screen (GE Healthcare). Steady-state kinetic analyses were performed according to a standard procedure (27Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were conducted under the same conditions as single nucleotide incorporation assays except that the primer-template DNA concentration was 10 nm; dCTP or dGTP was used at various concentrations; reactions were conducted at 22 °C, and polymerase concentrations and incubation times were adjusted not to exceed 25% of the product formation. Quantitative analyses were performed using ImageQuant 5.2 software (GE Healthcare). Rates of dNTP incorporation were plotted as a function of dNTP concentration, and the data were analyzed using Kaleidagraph 3.6 software (Synergy Software). The kcat and Km parameters with their error values were obtained from the best fit of the data to the following Michaelis-Menten equation: vobs = kcat[E][dNTP]/(Km + [dNTP]). Relative efficiencies were calculated as a ratio of the efficiency of reaction using ICL template to the efficiency measured for undamaged template. Transfection of GM639 Cells—siRNA transfections were performed as described previously (28Bruun D. Folias A. Akkari Y. Cox Y. Olson S. Moses R. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with SMARTpool siRNA (Dharmacon) specific to pol κ diluted to 0.30 μm or mock-transfected. The final transfection volumes were 1.0 ml for a T25 flask and 3.2 ml for a 100-mm dish. Cell Survival Assays—Twenty-four hours after siRNA transfection, cells were plated on 100-mm dishes to a density of 300 cells per dish in α-minimum Eagle's medium, treated with MMC (Sigma), and allowed to grow for 10 days. Cells were fixed in a solution of 50% MeOH and 1% new methylene blue (Sigma), and surviving colonies were counted. Chromosome Stability—Twenty-four hours after siRNA transfection, cells were treated with MMC (40 ng/ml), incubated for 48 h, and harvested as described (28Bruun D. Folias A. Akkari Y. Cox Y. Olson S. Moses R. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Slides were stained with Wright's stain, and 50 metaphases from each culture were scored for radial formation. Quantification of pol κ mRNA—Cells were harvested 24 h after siRNA transfection. RNA was stabilized using RNAlater (Ambion), extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), and quantified. Reverse transcription was performed using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) using 1 μg of starting RNA material. Real time quantitative PCR was performed using the iCycler iQ detection system (Bio-Rad) with 10 ng of starting cDNA material using the TaqMan gene expression assay specific to pol κ (Applied Biosystems). Primers specific to the housekeeping gene β-actin (Applied Biosystems) were used for internal control. Each sample was tested in triplicate. An amplification plot was created for each sample. Threshold values were calculated from the amplification plots correlating to the cycle number where fluorescence was detected above a calculated threshold. The mRNA concentrations for each sample were calculated with the Ct value and were normalized against β-actin expression. Negative controls for each primer were included in each experiment. Statistical Analysis—The means, means ± S.E., and p values from the Student's t tests were obtained using Kaleidagraph 3.6 software (Synergy Software). Mutagenic Properties of Model Acrolein-derived N2-N2-Guanine ICLs in Mammalian (COS-7) Cells—Previous studies have established that in human cells crotonaldehyde-mediated N2-N2-guanine ICLs were repaired mostly (>94%) in an error-free manner (9Liu X. Lao Y. Yang I.Y. Hecht S.S. Moriya M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12898-12905Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because acrolein-mediated ICLs are structurally similar to crotonaldehyde-mediated ICLs, we suggested that our model acrolein-derived N2-N2-guanine ICL (Fig. 1A) would not be highly mutagenic when plasmid vectors containing this lesion were replicated in mammalian cells. To test this hypothesis, oligodeoxynucleotides were constructed to contain a site-specific ICL in either a CpG or GpC sequence context (Fig. 1B) and engineered into a double-stranded DNA shuttle vector (pMS2) (24Moriya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The vector was replicated in COS-7 cells, and progeny DNAs were analyzed to determine frequency and types of mutations. In both the CpG and GpC sequence contexts, the mutation frequencies were very low, 3.0 and 3.2%, respectively (Table 1). Mutations were single base substitutions as well as deletions that generally began at, or one nucleotide downstream from the ICL and extended <15 nucleotides. Thus, during replication of plasmids containing model acrolein-mediated N2-N2-guanine ICLs, most bypass events were error-free in COS-7 cells. In the CpG sequence context, the base substitutions were G to T transversions, a result that is in agreement with previously reported data on mutagenic properties of crotonaldehyde-(9) and MMC-mediated N2-N2-guanine ICLs (5Zheng H. Wang X. Warren A.J. Legerski R.J. Nairn R.S. Hamilton J.W. Li L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); in both earlier studies the most frequently observed single base substitutions were G to T transversions.TABLE 1Mutations generated during replication of site-specifically modified pMS2 vector in COS-7 cellsDNA modificationColonies scoredSingle base substitutions, numberDeletionsFrequency of mutationsG to AG to CG to T%Undamaged31500000ICL in GpC34241153.2ICL in CpG6600203.0 Open table in a new tab Design and Construction of DNA Substrates for Replication Bypass Assays—To investigate DNA polymerase bypass of ICLs, DNAs containing acrolein-derived N2-N2 guanine cross-links (Fig. 1A) were designed to mimic potential intermediates in the processing of ICLs (Fig. 1C). Cross-linked DNA 1 (ICL1) represents a model of the DNA product following dual incision around the ICL site, whereas ICL2, ICL3, and ICL4 represent the products of either exonucleolytic or endonucleolytic processing of the 5′ or 3′ end or both, respectively, up to but not including the cross-link; justification for the specific design of these substrates is discussed below. The nondamaged ND2 substrate was designed to mimic a structure encountered by a polymerase in ICL1 and ICL3 but contains no damage. Endonucleolytic processing of ICL-containing DNAs has been addressed in a number of biochemical studies using either preparations of chromatin-associated proteins (29Kumaresan K.R. Hang B. Lambert M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30709-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or the purified XPF-ERCC1 complex (30Kuraoka I. Kobertz W.R. Ariza R.R.

Chem. 2008; 283: 1275-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), a structure-specific endonuclease that is essential for ICL repair (12Wu H.I. Brown J.A. Dorie M.J.

Biol. 2000; 20: 7980-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In these investigations, a variety of structurally diverse substrates was utilized, including splayed, Y-shaped, and fully duplex DNAs. Incisions were commonly observed both 5′ and 3′ to the ICL sites, suggesting generation of excision products, i.e. the DNA fragments that presumably remain connected to the opposite strand. The estimated sizes of these DNA fragments were in a range from 4 to 17 deoxynucleotides (29Kumaresan K.R. Hang B. Lambert M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30709-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Kuraoka I. Kobertz W.R. Ariza R.R. Biggerstaff M. Essigmann J.M. Wood R.D. J. Biol.

Thus, our ICL1 substrate, in which a 12-mer oligodeoxynucleotide is covalently attached to the longer strand, represents a reasonable model for a dually incised ICL-containing DNA. Recently, significant progress has been made in structural characterization of TLS polymerases. Although TLS polymerases appear to have relatively spacious active sites (14Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 33Uljon S.N. Johnson R.E. Edwards T.A. Prakash S. Prakash L. Aggarwal A.K.

Toxicol. 2008; 21: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it is hard to imagine that a dually incised ICL-containing DNA could be accommodated there, properly positioned, and utilized as template. Thus, remodeling of the overall DNA structure and/or processing of the incised DNA fragment is thought to be required prior to TLS. In this regard, it is significant that the XPF-ERCC1 complex and its yeast counterpart, Rad1-Rad10, both possess the 3′ to 5′ exonucleolytic activity (37Guzder S.N. Torres-Ramos C. Johnson R.E. Haracska L. Prakash L. Prakash S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2283-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 38Mu D. Bessho T. Nechev L.V. Chen D.J. Harris T.M. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2446-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Specifically, it has been shown that Rad1–Rad10 degrades DNA from the 3′ end, releasing products 3–6 nucleotides in length (37Guzder S.N. Torres-Ramos C. Johnson R.E. Haracska L. Prakash L. Prakash S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2283-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that following the endonucleolytic cleavage 3′ to the ICL site, incised DNA will be further processed exonucleolytically by the XPF-ERCC1 (Rad1–Rad10) complex. Such an action could create the structure as in our ICL3. ICL2 represents the product of exonucleolytic processing of the 5′ of the excised DNA fragment. The potential candidate to perform this reaction would be Snm1, which has a demonstrated 5′- to 3′-exonuclease activity (39Li X. Hejna J. Moses R.E. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 40Hejna J. Philip S. Ott J. Faulkner C. Moses R.

However, alternative enzymes could also play a role in the processing of ICL-containing DNA to yield structures that would favor replication bypass. These may include alternative exonucleases, replicative and repair helicases, flap endonucleases, and exonuclease activities associated with helicases and polymerases. Primer oligodeoxynucleotides (Fig. 1D) were designed to perform DNA syntheses under running start (–10 primer) or standing start (–1 primer) conditions or to test for extension from a nucleotide that is opposite the cross-linked G (0 primers).

The autoantibodies generated target the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein-3 (Dsg3). Previous studies demonstrate that upon PV IgG binding, Dsg3 is internalized and enters an endo-lysosomal pathway where it is degraded. To define the endocytic machinery involved in PV IgG-induced Dsg3 internalization, human keratinocytes were incubated with PV IgG, and various tools were used to perturb distinct endocytic pathways. The PV IgG ·Dsg3 complex failed to colocalize with clathrin, and inhibitors of clathrin- and dynamin-dependent pathways had little or no effect on Dsg3 internalization. In contrast, cholesterol binding agents such as filipin and nystatin and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein dramatically inhibited Dsg3 internalization. Furthermore, the Dsg3 cytoplasmic tail specified sensitivity to these inhibitors. Moreover, inhibition of Dsg3 endocytosis with genistein prevented disruption of desmosomes and loss of adhesion in the presence of PV IgG. Altogether, these results suggest that PV IgG-induced Dsg3 internalization is mediated through a clathrin- and dynamin-independent pathway and that Dsg3 endocytosis is tightly coupled to the pathogenic activity of PV IgG.

Desmosomes are adhesive junctions that provide robust adhesion between epithelial cells (1Yin T. Green K.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 2Getsios S. Huen A.C. Green K.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). These organelles are prominent in tissues that experience substantial mechanical stress such as the heart, bladder, gastrointestinal mucosa, and skin. Desmosomes are comprised primarily of proteins from three major families, the desmosomal cadherins desmogleins and desmocollins, armadillo proteins such as plakoglobin and the plakophilins, and members of the plakin family of cytolinkers such as desmoplakin (1Yin T.

Together, these proteins contribute to tissue integrity by coupling adhesive interactions mediated by the desmosomal cadherins to the keratin intermediate filament cytoskeleton, thereby integrating adhesive and cytoskeletal networks throughout the cells in a tissue. Although critical for tissue integrity, desmosomes are often remodeled and contribute to dynamic processes during development and wound healing. Furthermore, desmosomal components may also play pivotal roles in keratinocyte differentiation, morphogenesis, and tissue patterning as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (4Presland R.B.

Dsg3, a 130-kDa glycoprotein, is found primarily in the spinous and basal layers of the epidermis and throughout the oral mucosa (9Amagai M. Koch P.J. Nishikawa T. Stanley J.R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). As a result, PV is characterized histologically by suprabasal loss of cell-cell adhesion (acantholysis) and clinically by blistering of the skin and erosion of mucous membranes (7Payne A.S. Hanakawa Y. Amagai M. Stanley J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 8Anhalt G.J. Diaz L.A. J. Am. Acad.

Investig. 1994; 94: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In addition, experimentally generated mice in which the Dsg3 gene has been ablated exhibit histopathological characteristics of PV patients (12Koch P.J. Mahoney M.G. Ishikawa H. Pulkkinen L. Uitto J. Shultz L. Murphy G.F. Whitaker-Menezes D. Stanley J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1091-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). However, the precise cellular mechanism by which acantholysis occurs in response to PV IgG remains controversial. The epitopes on Dsg3 that are recognized by PV patient IgG and pathogenic monoclonal Dsg3 antibodies have been mapped and reside predominantly in the amino-terminal domain of Dsg3, a region of cadherins that structural studies have implicated in forming the adhesive interface (13Amagai M.

Immunol. 2003; 170: 2170-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). These types of studies argue strongly that PV IgG may cause loss of adhesion by steric hindrance of Dsg3 ectodomain interactions (7Payne A.S. Hanakawa Y. Amagai M. Stanley J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, other studies suggest that keratinocyte responses are needed for cells to lose adhesion (18Freedman S.D. Katz M.H. Parker E.M. Gelrud A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C306-C311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, desmosomes remain intact and keratinocytes remain adherent when incubated in the presence of PV IgG at 4 °C even though PV IgG are bound to Dsg3 (19Calkins C.C. Setzer S.V. Jennings J.M. Summers S. Tsunoda K. Amagai M. Kowalczyk A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7623-7634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In fact, keratinocytes must be incubated at 37 °C for several hours to detect substantial loss of adhesive strength. These and other data favor the hypothesis that keratinocyte responses are required for the loss of adhesion caused by PV IgG. These responses may include alterations in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (20Berkowitz P. Hu P. Warren S. Liu Z. Diaz L.A. Rubenstein D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Early studies demonstrated that PV IgG are internalized and targeted to lysosomes, and investigators postulated that PV IgG endocytosis might be coupled to the loss of adhesion characteristic of this disease (25Patel H.P.

In fact, several studies indicate that Dsg3 internalization and destabilization of desmosome integrity may be a key keratinocyte response to PV IgG. For example, PV IgG disrupts the assembly of functional desmosomes and causes rapid internalization and degradation of Dsg3 (5Kottke M.D. Delva E. Kowalczyk A.P. J.

Dermatol. 1999; 112: 67-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent pathways represent the two major routes for internalization of cell surface receptors (28Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar, 29Parton R.G. Richards A.A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 724-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 30Kirkham M. Parton R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1745: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the most thoroughly studied endocytic pathway, is characterized by the formation of clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane. Clathrin-dependent endocytosis requires the GTPase dynamin (31Hill E. van Der Kaay J. Downes C.P. Smythe E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 32Sever S.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar), which participates in the budding of clathrin-coated vesicles that are then destined for endosomal compartments. Clathrin-independent endocytosis, on the other hand, is less well understood. However, many endocytic pathways fall under this category and include caveolae-mediated endocytosis and micro and macropinocytosis as well as pathways that are both clathrin- and caveolae-independent (30Kirkham M. Parton R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1745: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Defining how specific receptors are internalized from the plasma membrane is critical for understanding how cells control the presentation of the receptor on the cell surface. In the current study a series of approaches was used to selectively manipulate various endocytic pathways and thereby reveal the mechanism of PV IgG-induced-Dsg3 internalization. The results indicate that the Dsg3 cytoplasmic tail mediates Dsg3 internalization in response to PV IgG through a clathrin- and dynamin-independent endocytic pathway. Furthermore, in cells treated with PV patient IgG, inhibition of Dsg3 endocytosis prevents Dsg3 down-regulation, desmoplakin mislocalization, and loss of adhesion in functional assays. These findings provide evidence that destabilization of Dsg3 through clathrin-independent endocytic pathways is functionally coupled to the loss of keratinocyte adhesion strength in response to PV IgG. Cells and Culture Conditions—Normal human keratinocytes (NHKs) were isolated and cultured as described previously (19Calkins C.C. Setzer S.V. Jennings J.M. Summers S. Tsunoda K. Amagai M. Kowalczyk A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7623-7634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Briefly, NHKs were isolated from neonatal foreskin and cultured in keratinocyte growth medium (Cambrex Corp., East Rutherford, NJ). NHKs were used for experimentation at passage 2 or 3. For experiments, cells were shifted to media containing 0.5 mm calcium 16-18 h before treatments and remained in this medium throughout the duration of the experiments. Antibodies and Ligands—Alexa Fluor EGF-488 and cholera toxin B (CTB)-488 were obtained from Invitrogen. The CD59 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugate monoclonal antibody was purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA). The monoclonal clathrin antibody was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Monoclonal IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) was obtained from R&D Systems. Appropriate species cross-absorbed secondary antibodies conjugated to various Alexa Fluors (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used for dual-label immunofluorescence. Normal human serum was obtained from Irvine Scientific (Santa Ana, CA). PV IgG was a kind gift from Dr. Robert Swerlick (Emory University, Atlanta, GA) and Dr. Masayuki Amagai (Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo) (8Anhalt G.J. Diaz L.A. J. Am. Acad.

Adenoviruses—A chimeric protein comprising the IL-2R extracellular domain and the VE-cadherin cytoplasmic tail was generated as described previously (34Xiao K. Allison D.F. Kottke M.D. Summers S.

A construct encoding the extracellular domain of the IL-2R (35LaFlamme S.E. Thomas L.A. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) was used to construct a chimeric cDNA with the IL-2R extracellular domain, the entire Dsg3 cytoplasmic tail, and a carboxyl-terminal FLAG epitope tag. The Dsg3 cytoplasmic domain construct was generated by PCR using the following primers: 5-primer, 5′-GCCATGACTAGTAGTGTGACTGTGGGGCAGGTTCTACT; 3-primer, 5′-CCGGATATCCTACTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCTATTAGACGGGAGCAAGGATCCTCTGTACA. The 3-primer includes an in-frame FLAG epitope tag followed by a stop codon. The resulting PCR product was ligated into pKS followed by subcloning into the pAD-Track-CMV vector. All constructs were characterized fully by DNA sequence analysis, Western blot, and immunofluorescence analysis. Adenoviruses carrying the IL-2R-Dsg3cyto-FLAG chimeric construct were produced using the pAdeasy adenovirus-packaging system as described previously (34Xiao K. Allison D.F. Kottke M.D. Summers S.

The caveolin-1 Y14F virus was a kind gift from Dr. Masuko Ushio-Fukai (University of Illinois at Chicago). Immunofluorescence—NHKs were prepared for immunofluorescence as described previously (19Calkins C.C. Setzer S.V. Jennings J.M. Summers S. Tsunoda K. Amagai M. Kowalczyk A.P. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were cultured on glass coverslips and shifted to media containing 0.5 mm calcium 16-18 h before treatment. Under the culture conditions used throughout this study, the keratinocytes predominantly expressed Dsg3 and low but detectable levels of Dsg1. For most experiments keratinocytes were incubated with affinity-purified human or mouse PV IgG on ice for 30 min to 1 h at a concentration of up to 1 mg/ml (diluted in media containing 0.5 mm calcium) to label the cell surface. Both human and mouse IgG were left on the cells throughout the duration of the experiment. Cells were then transferred to 37 °C for the indicated internalization times. After incubation at 37 °C, cells were returned on ice and treated with acid wash solution (3% bovine serum albumin, 25 mm glycine, pH 2.7) to remove cell surface-bound antibody. Cells were then fixed on ice using either -20 °C methanol for 5 min or 3.7% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) for 10 min followed by extraction in 0.5% Triton X-100 (Roche Diagnostics) for 7 min. To detect cell surface levels of Dsg3, cells were fixed on ice for 10 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde. After paraformaldehyde fixation, monoclonal anti-Dsg3 antibody AK15 (17Tsunoda K. Ota T. Aoki M. Yamada T. Nagai T. Nakagawa T. Koyasu S. Nishikawa T. Amagai M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2170-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) was used to stain for cell surface Dsg3. A Leica DMR-E fluorescence microscope equipped with narrow band-pass filters and a Hamamatsu Orca camera was used for image acquisition. Images were captured and processed using Simple PCI (Compix, Inc., Cranberry Township, PA). Manipulation of Endocytic Pathways—IgG internalization was performed as previously described (19Calkins C.C. Setzer S.V. Jennings J.M. Summers S. Tsunoda K. Amagai M. Kowalczyk A.P. J. Biol.

NHKs were pretreated with 5 μm filipin III (Sigma), 40 mm genistein (Sigma), 10 μm nystatin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml chlorpromazine (Sigma), and hypertonic sucrose (0.4 m sucrose) for 1 hat 37°C. For K+ depletion, cells were first incubated in hypotonic media (50% K+ depletion solution, 50% H2O) for 5 min at 37 °C followed by incubation in K+ depletion solution (20 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then incubated with a pathogenic mouse monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of Dsg3, AK23 (17Tsunoda K. Ota T. Aoki M. Yamada T. Nagai T. Nakagawa T. Koyasu S. Nishikawa T. Amagai M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2170-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) (diluted in media containing 0.5 mm calcium) on ice for 30 min. Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS+ (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) (or K+ depletion solution) followed by incubation at 37 °C for various times in media containing 0.5 mm calcium. After incubation at 37 °C, cells were returned on ice and treated with acid wash solution (3% bovine serum albumin, 25 mm glycine, pH 2.7) to remove cell surface-bound antibody. The cells were rinsed, fixed, and processed for dual label immunofluorescence as described above. In some cases endocytosis of CTB was assessed by monitoring CTB delivery to the perinuclear region of the cell as reported previously (37Le P.U. Nabi I.R. J.

Time Lapse Microscopy—Primary keratinocytes were cultured on chambered coverglass plates (Lab-Tek/Nunc, Rochester, NY) and shifted to medium containing 0.5 mm calcium 16-18 h before treatment. Cells were then incubated with a fluorescently tagged pathogenic mouse monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of Dsg3, AK23 (17Tsunoda K. Ota T. Aoki M. Yamada T. Nagai T. Nakagawa T. Koyasu S. Nishikawa T. Amagai M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2170-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), to label the cell surface. Cells were then transferred to 37 °C for the indicated internalization times. An inverted Leica DMIRE2 microscope equipped with narrow band-pass filters and a Hamamatsu Electron Multiplier back-thinned and deep-cooled CCD camera (C9100-12) was used for image acquisition. Temperature control was achieved using an environmental control chamber (Pecon Incubator ML) and heated stage insert (Pecon Heating Insert P). The camera, fully motorized microscope, and automated stage were driven by Simple PCI software. Dispase Cell Dissociation Assay—A dispase dissociation assay was performed as described previously (19Calkins C.C. Setzer S.V. Jennings J.M. Summers S. Tsunoda K. Amagai M. Kowalczyk A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7623-7634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Briefly, NHK cultures were seeded in triplicate onto 35-mm dishes containing keratinocyte growth medium and allowed to grow to confluence. 24 h after reaching confluence, cultures were switched to media containing 0.5 mm calcium for 16-18 h. The cells were then pretreated with 40 mm genistein for 1 h at 37°C (Sigma) and treated with either normal human IgG or PV IgG (diluted media containing 0.5 mm calcium) and incubated on ice for 30 min to 1 h. After incubation, cells were incubated in 1 unit/ml dispase (diluted in PBS+) (Roche Diagnostics) for more than 30 min. Released monolayers were subjected to mechanical stress by transferring the cell sheets to 15-ml conical tubes. The tubes were then subjected to 50 inversion cycles on a rocker panel. Fragments were counted using a dissecting microscope. The mechanism by which membrane receptors are internalized can be delineated by selectively inhibiting endocytic pathways using well established procedures. These approaches include manipulating the cellular ionic environment (39Liu J. Kesiry R. Periyasamy S.M. Malhotra D. Xie Z. Shapiro J.I.

In the current study we utilized this matrix of approaches to define the mechanism of Dsg3 endocytosis and to examine the functional relationships between Dsg3 internalization and the loss of adhesion in response to pathogenic PV IgG.TABLE 1Requirements necessary for internalization via distinct endocytic pathwaysEndocytic pathwayClathrin-mediatedCaveolae-mediatedNon-caveolar raft-dependentDependent on clathrin×Dependent on caveolin×Sensitive to hypertonic sucrose, K+ depletion, and chlorpromazine×Sensitive to cholesterol-perturbing agents i.e. filipin and nystatin××Dependent on dynamin activity××Dependent on tyrosine kinase activity××× Open table in a new tab PV IgG-induced Dsg3 Internalization Is Mediated by a Clathrin-independent Pathway—PV IgG binding causes Dsg3 internalization, dramatically accelerated degradation of Dsg3, and the loss of cell-cell adhesion strength (19Calkins C.C.

To determine whether PV IgG-induced Dsg3 internalization is mediated through a clathrin-dependent pathway, hypertonic sucrose and K+ depletion were employed to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. For these experiments, keratinocytes were incubated with either EGF (as a control) or a pathogenic antibody directed against Dsg3 (monoclonal antibody AK23) and placed at 37 °C to allow for internalization. A low pH wash was then used to remove cell surface-bound ligand without removing internalized ligands. At 37 °C, both AK23-Dsg3 and EGF-EGFR were internalized, as expected (Fig. 1, A, B, and G). K+ depletion and hypertonic sucrose dramatically inhibited EGF internalization, a ligand internalized via a clathrin-mediated pathway (Fig. 1, D, F, and G). In contrast, substantial Dsg3 endocytosis was still observed when clathrin-mediated endocytosis was blocked (Fig. 1, C, E, and G). These initial results suggest that Dsg3 internalization is mediated through a clathrin-independent pathway. To further elucidate the mechanism of Dsg3 internalization, the localization of the PV-IgG ·Dsg3 complex was compared with the distribution of clathrin and caveolin-1. As shown in Fig. 2, we were unable to demonstrate colocalization between Dsg3 and clathrin (A-C). However, the PV IgG-Dsg3 complex colocalized with caveolin-1 at the cell surface and in intracellular vesicular pools (Fig. 2, D-F). To determine whether the PV IgG ·Dsg3 complex is internalized through the use of lipid rafts, co-internalization assays were performed to monitor Dsg3 and CD59, a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored protein known to be internalized through a lipid raft-dependent pathway (46Sabharanjak S. Sharma P. Parton R.G. Mayor S. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 411-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 47Skretting G. Torgersen M.L. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. J.

These results further suggest that Dsg3 is internalized through a clathrin-independent mechanism. The Cytoplasmic Tail of Dsg3 Specifies the Mechanism of Internalization—Although the extracellular domain of Dsg3 is the target of PV IgG binding, the cytoplasmic portion contains a number of domains which may play a role in mediating Dsg3 internalization. In previous studies we found that the VE-cadherin cytoplasmic tail mediates clathrin-dependent endocytosis in microvascular endothelial cells (50Xiao K. Garner J. Buckley K.M. Vincent P.A. Chiasson C.M. Dejana E. Faundez V. Kowalczyk A.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5141-5151Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that different cell types internalize cadherins through different mechanisms or, alternatively, that different cadherins harbor determinants within their domain structure that dictate the mode of endocytosis. To distinguish these possibilities, the VE-cadherin and Dsg3 cytoplasmic tails were fused to the extracellular domain of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R-VE-cadcyto and IL-2R-Dsg3cyto, respectively). These chimeric proteins were then expressed in keratinocytes for use in internalization assays in the presence or absence of agents that selectively inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. As previously reported (50Xiao K. Garner J. Buckley K.M. Vincent P.A. Chiasson C.M. Dejana E. Faundez V. Kowalczyk A.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5141-5151Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), internalization of the IL-2R-VE-cadcyto chimera is completely eliminated upon inhibition of clathrin-dependent endocytosis (Fig. 3, D-G). However, similar to endogenous Ds"
https://openalex.org/W2005162507,"The annexin A2 (A2) heterotetramer, consisting of two copies of A2 and two copies of S100A10/p11, promotes fibrinolytic activity on the surface of vascular endothelial cells by assembling plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and accelerating the generation of plasmin. In humans, overexpression of A2 by acute promyelocytic leukemia cells is associated with excessive fibrinolysis and hemorrhage, whereas anti-A2 autoantibodies appear to accentuate the risk of thrombosis in patients with anti-phospholipid syndrome. Complete deficiency of A2 in mice leads to a lack of tPA cofactor activity, accumulation of intravascular fibrin, and failure to clear arterial thrombi. Within the endothelial cell, p11 is required for Src kinase-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of A2, which signals translocation of both proteins to the cell surface. Here we show that p11 is expressed at very low levels in the absence of A2 both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate further that unpartnered p11 becomes polyubiquitinated and degraded via a proteasome-dependent mechanism. A2 stabilizes intracellular p11 through direct binding, thus masking an autonomous p11 polyubiquitination signal that triggers proteasomal degradation. This interaction requires both the p11-binding N-terminal domain of A2 and the C-terminal domain of p11. This mechanism prevents accumulation of free p11 in the endothelial cell and suggests that regulation of tPA-dependent cell surface fibrinolytic activity is precisely tuned to the intracellular level of p11. The annexin A2 (A2) heterotetramer, consisting of two copies of A2 and two copies of S100A10/p11, promotes fibrinolytic activity on the surface of vascular endothelial cells by assembling plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and accelerating the generation of plasmin.

Vascular endothelial cells modulate blood fluidity through the elaboration of secreted products and through expression of membrane-associated thromboresistance molecules (1Pober J.S. Sessa W.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Fluid phase products include endothelin, nitric oxide, tissue plasminogen activator, and prostacylin, whereas cell surface regulators include tissue factor pathway inhibitor, heparan sulfate-bound antithrombin III, and the thrombomodulin-endothelial cell protein C receptor complex (2Hajjar K.A. Esmon N.L. Marcus A.J. Muller W.A. Lichtman M.A. Beutler E. Kipps T.J. Seligsohn U. Kaushansky K. Prchal J.T. Williams Hematology. McGraw-Hill, New York2006: 1715-1739Google Scholar). In addition, endothelial cells assemble fibrinolytic proteins through expression of cell surface receptors such as the urokinase receptor and annexin A2. The latter systems activate plasmin and limit fibrin accumulation in response to vascular injury (3Hajjar K.A. Francis C.W. Lichtman M.A. Beutler E. Kipps T.J. Seligsohn U. Kaushansky K. Prchal J.T. Williams Hematology. McGraw-Hill, New York2006: 2089-2115Google Scholar). Annexin A2 (A2) 2The abbreviations used are: A2, annexin A2; siRNA, short interfering RNA; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; CMEC, cardiac microvascular endothelial cell; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HA, hemagglutinin. is one of a dozen annexin family members expressed in humans (4Gerke V. Creutz C.E. Moss S.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 5Moss S.E. Morgan R.O. Genome Biol. 2004; 5 (8): 219.1-21219Crossref Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The annexins are calcium-regulated, membrane-binding proteins that possess a C-terminal phospholipid-binding core domain as well as an N-terminal ligand-interacting domain. Although cytoplasmic A2 is mainly monomeric, membrane-associated A2 is part of a heterotetrameric complex in which the N termini of two copies of A2 bind to dual copies of the S100 family protein, S100A10 (p11) (6Cesarman-Maus G. Hajjar K.A. Br. J. Haematol. 2005; 129: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Complex formation with p11 increases the affinity of A2 for calcium and phospholipid, thereby directing it to membrane surfaces (7Powell M.A. Glenney J.R. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition, the A2 heterotetramer specifically binds tissue plasminogen activator as well as its substrate, plasminogen, and strongly accelerates the catalytic efficiency of plasmin generation in vitro (8Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kassam G. Choi K.S. Ghuman J. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Zackson T. Zackson S. Toba M. Shinomiya A. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4790-4799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that the A2 complex regulates fibrin homeostasis in vivo, both under basal conditions and in response to vascular injury. First, A2–/– microvascular endothelial cells were found to lack tPA cofactor activity, and the fibrin content of highly perfused A2–/– tissues was ∼2-fold greater than that observed in wild type controls (10Ling Q. Jacovina A.T. Deora A.B. Febbraio M. Simantov R. Silverstein R.L. Hempstead B.L. Mark W. Hajjar K.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Second, arterial injury in A2–/– mice was followed by a 2-fold increase in the degree of thrombotic vascular occlusion with an equivalent reduction in blood flow recovery. Third, injury-induced carotid artery thrombosis in rats was averted by pretreatment with recombinant A2 (11Ishii H. Yoshida M. Hiraoka M. Hajjar K.A. Tanaka A. Yasukochi Y. Numano F. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1240-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fourth, cerebral infarct size was reduced and cerebral blood flow increased upon infusion of recombinant A2 in a rat model of embolic stroke (12Tanaka Y. Ishii H. Hiraoka M. Miyasaka N. Kuroiwa T. Hajjar K.A. Nagaoka T. Duong T.Q. Ohno K. Yoshida M. Brain Res. 2007; 1165: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Fifth, A2 was strikingly overexpressed in blast cells and associated with hyperfibrinolysis and hemorrhage in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (13Menell J.S. Cesarman G.M. Jacovina A.T. McLaughlin M.A. Lev E.A. Hajjar K.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 994-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Sixth, autoantibodies directed against A2 were highly prevalent and highly associated with clinical thrombosis in patients with the anti-phospholipid syndrome (14Cesarman-Maus G. Rios-Luna N.P. Deora A.B. Huang B. Villa R. Cravioto M.C. Alarcon-Segovia D. Sanchez-Guerrero J. Hajjar K.A. Blood. 2006; 107: 4375-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the A2-p11 complex is a significant regulator of in vivo fibrin balance. Protein p11 (also known as S100A10) belongs to the S100 family of proteins, which consists of some 19 separate gene products ranging in molecular mass from 9 to 14 kDa (15Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar, 16Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Members are characterized by two EF-hand type calcium-binding motifs, each represented by a helix-loop-helix structure, defined by a calcium-binding loop flanked by two α-helices. At least three different S100 proteins (S100A11, S100A10, and S100A6) bind annexins (annexins 1, 2, and 11, respectively) through amphipathic helices located in the annexin N-terminal interaction domains (4Gerke V. Creutz C.E. Moss S.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of p11 in complex with the N-terminal 13 amino acids of A2 supports this model and suggests that the basic unit of p11 structure is a noncovalently linked homodimer, each component of which binds the A2 tail peptide to form a heterotetramer (17Rety S. Sopkova J. Renouard M. Osterloh D. Gerke V. Tabaries S. Russo-Marie F. Lewit-Bentley A. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 85-89Google Scholar). Upon binding to p11, the A2 tail peptide assumes an amphipathic helix that introduces key hydrophobic residues (Val3, Ile6, and Leu10) within a hydrophobic cleft formed by loop 2 and helix IV of one p11 monomer, and helix I of the other (17Rety S. Sopkova J. Renouard M. Osterloh D. Gerke V. Tabaries S. Russo-Marie F. Lewit-Bentley A. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 85-89Google Scholar, 18Becker T. Weber K. Johnsson N. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4204-4213Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Within the C-terminal helix IV region of p11 (85YFVVHM90), hydrophobic residues, such as Tyr85 and Phe86, contribute additional contact points for binding to A2 (19Kube E. Becker T. Weber K. Gerke V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14175-14182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In canonical S100 proteins, calcium binding induces a conformational change that places helix III in a more perpendicular orientation relative to helix IV, forming a cleft that can more readily accept target proteins (15Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). However, p11 is an exception to the calcium activation rule, as it permanently assumes a “calcium-on” state, due to replacement of the monodentate Asp56 with Cys61 and the bidentate Glu65 with Ser70 (20Glenney J.R. FEBS Lett. 1985; 192: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Johnsson N. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14464-15568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pairing of intracellular p11 and A2 thus occurs constitutively and consequently is regulated by the concentration of each binding partner, rather than by calcium flux. Among the few agents known to selectively increase p11 without altering cellular A2 are interferon-γ (22Huang X.L. Pawliczak R. Yao X.L. Cowan M.J. Gladwin M.T. Walter M.J. Holtzman M.J. Madara P. Logun C. Shelhamer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9298-9308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and thrombin (23Petersen E.A. Sutherland M.R. Nesheim M.E. Pryzdial E.L. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2399-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). p11 appears to function in the trafficking and membrane anchorage of several membrane proteins (24Rescher U. Gerke V. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2007; 455: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). For example, the tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channel (Nav 1.8) (25Okuse K. Malik-Hall M.

Flajolet M. Zhang X. Yacoubi M.E. Vaugeois J.M. Nomikos G.G. Greengard P. Science. 2006; 311: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) are all integral membrane proteins that appear to require p11 binding for their cell surface presentation and activity. Similarly, we have shown that expression of the annexin A2-p11 complex on the surface of endothelial cells is a dynamic process that is stimulated by cellular injury such as that seen in heat shock. In addition to Src-mediated tyrosine 23 phosphorylation of A2, translocation of A2 to the endothelial cell surface requires expression of p11, because silencing of p11 expression specifically prevents the appearance of new A2 on the cell surface (32Deora A.B. Kreitzer G. Jacovina A.T. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43411-43418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Previously, Puisieux and Ozturk (33Puisieux A. Ji J. Ozturk M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) reported that transfection of HepG2 cells with an A2 expression construct leads to new expression of A2, as well as up-regulation of p11 through a post-translational mechanism. In this study, we report that in the absence of A2, endothelial cell p11 is rapidly polyubiquitinated and degraded via a proteasome-dependent pathway both in vitro and in vivo. We have identified an autonomous degradation determinant, or “degron,” on p11 that is specifically masked upon association of p11 with A2. We have mapped its location to the C-terminal extension of p11. In the absence of sufficient A2, we suggest that polyubiquitin-mediated degradation of p11 prevents accumulation of free p11, thus maintaining a precise compartmentalization of A2 monomer and tetramer. Because p11 is required for translocation of A2 to the cell surface (32Deora A.B. Kreitzer G. Jacovina A.T. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43411-43418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), our data suggest that A2-mediated endothelial cell fibrinolysis is a dynamic function, subject to regulation by ambient p11 levels. Reagents and Antibodies—N-Carbobenzoxyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal (MG132), lactacystin, leupeptin, trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-4-guanidino butane, N-α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Bortezomib was from Millennium. Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The following antibodies were purchased from the indicated vendors: anti-actin, anti-GAPDH, anti-Myc 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-β-tubulin (Sigma); anti-A2 and anti-p11 (BD Transduction Laboratories); anti-hemagglutinin (HA) (Roche Applied Science or Zymed Laboratories Inc.); anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma); anti-GFP (Zymed Laboratories Inc. or Clontech). Polyclonal antibodies against a peptide sequence of mouse p11 were produced and affinity-purified at Covance. Mice—A2–/– were generated as described previously (10Ling Q. Jacovina A.T. Deora A.B. Febbraio M. Simantov R. Silverstein R.L. Hempstead B.L. Mark W. Hajjar K.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). All animal experiments were according to IACUC guidelines. Plasmid Constructs—The human p11 pET23 expression vector was a generous gift from Professor Volker Gerke (University of Meunster, Germany). C-terminal truncations and N-terminal FLAG-tagged (DYKDDDDK) versions of the p11 cDNA were constructed in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Full-length or truncated cDNA fragments encoding human A2 were generated by standard PCR methods and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(+)MycHis vector (Invitrogen). HA-ubiquitin wild type and K48R and K29R mutant plasmids were provided by Dr. Ze'ev Ronai (Mt. Sinai School of Medicine) (34Xiong H. Li H. Kong H.J. Chen Y. Zhao J. Xiong S. Huang B. Gu H. Mayer L. Ozato K. Unkeless J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23531-23539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The fusion plasmid GFP-p11(86–97) was constructed by appending p11 C terminus sequence at amino acids 86–97 to the C-terminal end of GFP (Clontech). Endothelial Cells and Cell Lines—A2+/+ and A2–/– mouse cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMEC) were obtained as described previously (10Ling Q. Jacovina A.T. Deora A.B. Febbraio M. Simantov R. Silverstein R.L. Hempstead B.L. Mark W. Hajjar K.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). First passage subconfluent CMEC were immortalized via sequential transduction with highly efficient DNA flap lentiviral vectors encoding human telomerase (100 ng p24 units/ml) or SV40 large T antigen (20 ng p24 units/ml) in EGM-2 medium (35Weksler B.B.

Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Individually transduced cells were isolated by limiting dilution, and clones were selected on the basis of cobblestone morphology, contact inhibition at confluence, and uptake of acetylated low density lipoprotein. Cells transduced in this manner, as well as their conditioned media, were shown to be free of detectable retroviral particles, using a sensitive enzyme assay for p24 in the first and second passages. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were harvested and propagated as described (8Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfections—HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected using DNA-calcium phosphate precipitation and 10–20 μg of plasmid (37Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Cell. 1978; 14: 725-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Mouse A2–/– CMEC were electroporated with 20–30 μg of plasmid using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) at 250 V and 975 microfarads. Flow Cytometry and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting—Mouse A2–/– CMEC, cotransfected with A2 and GFP, were subjected to flow cytometry and cell sorting using a FACStar Plus or FACSVantage cell sorter (BD Biosciences) equipped with an INNOVA 70-4 argon laser tuned to 488 nm. Nonviable cells were excluded by gating on forward and side scatter. GFP signals were detected with a 530/30-nm bandpass filter. Cells were sorted according to GFP positivity with >90% efficiency at 2500–3000 events/s using forward scatter as a triggering signal. Data acquisition and analysis (≥10,000 events per analysis) were performed with CellQuest software. Immunoblotting—Proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked (5% nonfat milk in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 280 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20), incubated with primary antibodies (1 h), exposed to peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences), and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from A2+/+ and A2–/– mouse tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using the one-step reverse transcription-PCR kit (Qiagen) for 30 cycles according to the manufacturer's protocol, using mouse p11, annexin A2, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene-specific primers. The products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Coimmunoprecipitation—Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed (15 min, 4 °C) in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 280 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were clarified (4 °C, 15 min, 18,000 × g), and aliquots (500 μg) incubated with 5 μg of anti-HA or anti-FLAG IgG (18 h, 4 °C) with gentle rocking. Immune complexes were collected with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose, washed three times with lysis buffer, denatured with Laemmli buffer, and immunoblotted. A2 Silencing—siRNA directed at A2, as well as control oligonucleotides (100 nm, Qiagen, or targeted to 146–165 of A2, from Dharmacon), were transiently transfected according to the manufacturer's instructions into HUVECs propagated in 6-well plates using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). At 72 h after transfection, cells were harvested and tested for p11 or A2 expression. A2–/– Tissues Express Low Levels of p11 Protein—Tissues from A2–/– and A2+/+ mice were analyzed by RT-PCR for steady state p11 mRNA levels (Fig. 1A). p11 mRNA was detected uniformly in tissues from mice of both genotypes, whereas A2 mRNA was only detected in A2+/+ tissues and in variable quantities. On the other hand, p11 protein was readily observed by immunoblot analysis in A2+/+ tissues but not observed in extracts of lung, heart, spleen, kidney, and liver from A2–/– mice (Fig. 1B). To determine whether p11 protein expression was linked to that of A2, we cotransfected A2-myc and GFP expression plasmids into A2–/– CMEC, which express low levels of p11 (Fig. 1C). In CMEC selected for GFP positivity by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, reconstitution of A2 expression was associated with a significant increase in p11 by immunoblot analysis. This result suggested a role for A2 in stabilizing p11 protein expression. We next addressed whether endogenous endothelial cell p11 is degraded via a proteasomal mechanism. Treatment of A2–/– CMEC with the proteasomal inhibitor, MG132, resulted in increased expression of p11 within 2 h. Expression peaked at 8–12 h, at which point it showed a 4–6-fold increase relative to levels of GAPDH, which remained unchanged (Fig. 2A). Because polyubiquitination typically predetermines proteins for degradation in the proteasome, we next employed A2 siRNA to deplete A2 in nonimmortalized, low passage human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), and then further treated the cells with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 to enable detection of polyubiquitinated species (Fig. 2B). By immunoblot analysis, depletion of A2 reduced intracellular levels of both A2 and p11, whereas levels of A6 and GAPDH were not appreciably altered. In cells treated with an irrelevant siRNA, both A2 and p11 were easily detected. Immunoblot analysis of proteins precipitated with anti-ubiquitin revealed the accumulation of high molecular weight species with increasing time of proteasomal inhibition. This effect was not observed in cells in which A2 was not depleted. Similarly injection of bortezomib, a proteasomal protease inhibitor, into A2–/– mice (Fig. 2C), significantly rescued p11 protein expression in the lung, without interfering with GAPDH expression. Taken together, these data establish that p11 is polyubiquitinated in low passage human cells when A2 is depleted or absent and that p11 can be rescued by inhibition of proteasomal protease activity both in vitro and in vivo. p11 Is Polyubiquitinated in an A2-sensitive Manner—We next developed a transient transfection system to study the fate of p11 in the absence of A2. We transfected HEK 293 cells, which express very low levels of p11 and A2, with FLAG-p11 (Fig. 3A). After 48 h, protein synthesis was arrested with cycloheximide, and p11 expression was examined by immunoblot at 2–8 h. In the absence of exogenous A2, expression of p11 decreased with a t½ of ∼5.6 h. In the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, however, p11 was stabilized. Treatment with lactacystin, another proteasome inhibitor, also stabilized p11, whereas inhibitors of lysosomal enzymes and calpains failed to do so (supplemental Fig. 1). To determine whether ubiquitin marks unpartnered p11 for proteasomal degradation, we cotransfected HEK 293 cells with plasmids encoding FLAG-p11 and HA-ubiquitin (Fig. 3B). After 48 h, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA IgG and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG IgG. Ubiquitinated p11 conjugates were readily detected in a pattern typical for polyubiquitinated proteins, even in the absence of proteasome inhibitors, indicating the presence of high levels of p11-polyubiquitin conjugates (Fig. 3B, left panel). Similarly, immunoprecipitation of the same lysates with anti-FLAG IgG and immunoblotting with anti-HA IgG also revealed the association of ubiquitin with p11 (Fig. 3B, right panel). These data indicate that exogenously expressed FLAG-p11 is subject to ubiquitination in HEK 293 cells. Although lysine 48 of ubiquitin is the primary site for polyubiquitination, ubiquitin polymers can also be linked to target proteins through lysine 29 (38Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2727-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 39Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). K48R and K29R ubiquitin mutants act as dominant negative inhibitors of polyubiquitination by inducing premature termination of ubiquitin chains and accumulation of incompletely ubiquitinated species that are not properly targeted for degradation by the proteasome (40Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 14: 725-731Google Scholar). To determine whether polyubiquitination is required for the degradation of p11, we cotransfected HEK 293 cells with plasmids encoding FLAG-p11, as well as K48R and K29R ubiquitin mutants. Expression of either mutant resulted in accumulation of FLAG-p11, suggesting that disruption of the polyubiquitin chain elongation stabilizes p11 (Fig. 3C). In addition, polyubiquitination of p11 was diminished upon cotransfection of FLAG-p11 with K48R (Fig. 3D). We conclude that polyubiquitination of p11 is necessary for its degradation in transfected HEK 293 cells. The N-terminal Domain of A2 Is Required for Rescue of p11—A2 spontaneously forms a heterotetramer with p11 (41Thiel C. Osborn M. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 733-742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the association of p11 with A2 in our cotransfection system, as immune complexes precipitated with anti-FLAG IgG were also specifically recognized by anti-Myc IgG (Fig. 4A). To determine whether association with A2 blocks p11 degradation, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-p11 with or without A2-myc, pretreated with cycloheximide, and then treated with MG132 (Fig. 4B). By immunoblot analysis, FLAG-p11 was stabilized by either treatment with MG132 or cotransfection with A2-myc. To confirm the regulatory role of A2 in p11 degradation, we transfected an HA-ubiquitin construct, together with FLAG-p11 and increasing molar ratios of A2-myc (Fig. 4C). Ubiquitin-conjugated FLAG-p11 species were assessed by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA IgG and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG IgG. Although mono- and polyubiquitinated p11 species were detected in cells transfected with p11 alone, cotransfection with A2 efficiently blocked p11 ubiquitination in a dose-related manner. Interestingly, the most highly ubiquitinated species disappeared first. These data strongly imply that A2 blocks polyubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of p11. Furthermore, the regulation of p11 degradation by A2 was selective; in parallel experiments, we observed no difference in TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation in A2–/– versus A2+/+ CMEC, indicating that A2 has no effect on ubiquitination of IκBα (not shown). The first 14 amino acids of A2 interact with p11 to form the functional heterotetramer (42Johnsson N. Marriott G. Weber K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 43Jost M. Zeusschner D. Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 221-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether protection of p11 is controlled by the N-terminal tail domain of A2, two Myc-tagged N-terminal truncation mutants of A2 (residues 16–340 and 25–340, respectively) were expressed in HEK 293 cells at levels similar to the full-length protein. After 48 h, the cells were treated with cycloheximide (8 h), and cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-FLAG, anti-Myc, and anti-actin IgG. Expression of p11 was preserved in the presence full-length A2, whereas neither N-terminal deletion mutant protected p11 (Fig. 4D). Further coimmunoprecipitation experiments on HEK 293 cells triply transfected with A2-myc, FLAG-p11, and HA-ubiquitin showed that the two truncated A2 mutants failed to interact with p11 and allowed it to be highly ubiquitinated (supplemental Fig. 2). Collectively, these data reveal that residues within the first 15 p11-binding amino acids of A2 are required to prevent p11 ubiquitination. The C Terminus of p11 Contains a Polyubiquitina"
https://openalex.org/W2117507908,"The hyaluronic acid receptor for endocytosis (HARE; also designated Stabilin-2) mediates systemic clearance of hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfates from the vascular and lymphatic circulations. The internalized glycosaminoglycans are degraded in lysosomes, thus completing their normal turnover process. Sinusoidal endothelial cells of human liver, lymph node, and spleen express two HARE isoforms of 315 and 190 kDa. Here we report that the 190- and 315-kDa HARE isoforms, expressed stably either in Flp-In 293 cell lines or as soluble ectodomains, specifically bind heparin (Hep). The K(d) for Hep binding to purified 190- and 315-kDa HARE ectodomains was 17.2 +/- 4.9 and 23.4 +/- 5.3 nm, respectively. Cells expressing HARE readily and specifically internalized (125)I-streptavidin-biotin-Hep complexes, which was inhibited >70% by hyperosmolar conditions, confirming that uptake is mediated by the clathrin-coated pit pathway. Internalization of Hep occurred for many hours with an estimated HARE recycling time of approximately 12 min. Internalized fluorescent streptavidin-biotin-Hep was present in a typical endocytic vesicular pattern and was delivered to lysosomes. We conclude that HARE in the sinusoidal endothelial cells of lymph nodes and liver likely mediates the efficient systemic clearance of Hep and many different Hep-binding protein complexes from the lymphatic and vascular circulations."
https://openalex.org/W2053447053,"A number of proteins involved in cell growth control, including members of the Ras family of GTPases, are modified at their C terminus by a three-step posttranslational process termed prenylation. The enzyme isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyl-transferase (Icmt) catalyzes the last step in this process, and genetic and pharmacological suppression of Icmt activity significantly impacts on cell growth and oncogenesis. Screening of a diverse chemical library led to the identification of a specific small molecule inhibitor of Icmt, cysmethynil, that inhibited growth factor signaling and tumorigenesis in an in vitro cancer cell model (Winter-Vann, A.

To further evaluate the mechanisms through which this Icmt inhibitor impacts on cancer cells, we developed both in vitro and in vivo models utilizing PC3 prostate cancer cells.

Posttranslational processing of so-called CaaX proteins has received much attention in the past two decades due to the important roles these proteins play in biological regulations and diseases (1Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar, 2Gelb M.H. Brunsveld L. Hrycyna C.A. Michaelis S. Tamanoi F. Van Voorhis W.C. Waldmann H. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This processing is initiated by isoprenoid modification of the cysteine residue of the C-terminal CAAX motif of the protein, subsequent proteolytic removal of the three C-terminal amino acids, i.e. the –AAX residues, and the methylation of the newly exposed carboxyl group of the prenylated cysteine residue. The overall process, termed protein prenylation, has been shown to be important for the localization, stability, and ultimate functions of a broad array of CaaX proteins (3Magee T. Seabra M.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Most members of the Ras superfamily of GTPases are CaaX proteins, and Ras proteins themselves, which are farnesylated, have been extensively studied due to the high prevalence of dysregulated Ras signaling in human cancers (4Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar).

Kirschmeier P. Baum C. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: S96-S104Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 6Sebti S.M. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 297-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The realization that some CaaX proteins, including forms of Ras in which mutations are prevalent in human tumors, are subject to alternative prenylation by protein geranylgeranyltransferase I when FTase is inhibited (7Whyte D.B. Kirschmeier P. Hockenberry T.N. Nunez-Oliva I. James L. Catino J.J. Bishop W.R. Pai J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14459-14464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) spurred efforts to target the postprenylation processing steps of proteolysis and methylation since each of these steps is catalyzed by a single enzyme that acts on both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated proteins (8Ashby M.N. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In particular, targeting of CaaX protein methylation via inhibition of the enzyme responsible, isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (Icmt), through both genetic and pharmacological approaches, has been shown to dramatically impair oncogenesis in several tumor cell models (10Bergo M.O. Gavino B.J. Hong C. Beigneux A.P. McMahon M. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 11Winter-Vann A.M. Baron R.A. Wong W. dela Cruz J.

The mechanism(s) through which inhibition of Icmt impacts on cell proliferation and oncogenesis are still far from clear. Interference with cell cycle progression, however, is a cornerstone of many chemotherapeutic agents, and both FTase inhibition and geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibition have been demonstrated to arrest many types of tumor cells at G1 phase of the cell cycle; FTase inhibitors also trigger a G2/M arrest in certain cell types (5Bishop W.R. Kirschmeier P. Baum C. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: S96-S104Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 6Sebti S.M. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 297-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 12Cox A. Der C. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Another important property of cancer chemotherapeutic agents is the ability to induce cell death. The process of apoptosis in particular has been widely studied in this regard, and many current anticancer agents, including CaaX prenylation inhibitors, enhance apoptosis in cells (6Sebti S.M. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 297-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 13Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2695) Google Scholar). Quite recently, autophagic cell death has stepped into the spotlight as a type of programmed cell death with the potential to be enhanced by cancer therapeutics (14Kondo Y. Kanzawa T. Sawaya R. Kondo S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar, 15Hippert M.M. O'Toole P.S. Thorburn A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9349-9351Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). As with many biological regulatory processes, autophagy seems to be a double-edged sword in terms of an impact on cell functions. Most cell types display a baseline level of autophagy to clear damaged organelles and unwanted proteins, but dysregulation of the autophagy process can be detrimental to cell survival. Consequently, manipulation of autophagy is now considered to present therapeutic opportunities in several disease states, including cancer (16Huang J. Klionsky D.J. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 1837-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We recently reported the identification of a specific small molecule inhibitor of Icmt, cysmethynil, and demonstrated a mechanism-based impact on tumorigenesis in an in vitro cancer cell model (11Winter-Vann A.M. Baron R.A. Wong W. dela Cruz J. York J.D. Gooden D.M. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. Toone E.J. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4336-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We now report that treatment of PC3 prostate cancer cells with cysmethynil impairs cell cycle progression and, unexpectedly, activates an autophagic process in the cells and promotes autophagy-dependent cell death. Further, treatment of mice harboring xenograft tumors with cysmethynil results in dramatic impairment of tumor growth. These results identify a novel mechanism for the antitumor effects of Icmt inhibition and strengthen the support for targeting Icmt in cancer chemotherapy. Materials—Cysmethynil and biotin S-farnesylcysteine were synthesized by the Duke Small Molecule Synthesis Facility via established methods (11Winter-Vann A.M. Baron R.A. Wong W. dela Cruz J. York J.D. Gooden D.M. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. Toone E.J. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4336-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 17Baron R.A. Casey P.J. BMC Biochem. 2004; 5: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cysmethynil analog 1-octyl-m-tolyl-1H-indole (J3) was synthesized via standard chemical procedures and characterized to confirm identity and purity (see the supplemental text and scheme). Stock solutions were prepared at 10 mm in DMSO and stored at –20 °C. Antibodies recognizing cyclins D1 and B1, p27, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-2, caspase 3, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1), and GAPDH were all from Cell Signaling. The LC3 antibody was from Abgent. Cell Culture and Proliferation Assays—The PC3 human prostate cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 50 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For proliferation assays, cells were seeded at 15–20% confluency in DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum in 96-well plates for 24 h prior to treatment with specific agents (e.g. cysmethynil) or vehicle at the concentrations and length of time indicated in the legends for Figs. 1, 2. The relative number of the live cells was determined using the CellTiter® 96 AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay (Promega). Each condition was performed in quadruplicate, and data presented that obtained from at least three separate experiments. For proliferation studies performed with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) in addition to cysmethynil, cells were seeded as above and incubated with 0.5 mm 3-MA or vehicle at 37 °C overnight. Cells were then treated with the concentrations of cysmethynil as indicated in the legend for Fig. 1 in the continued presence of 0.5 mm of 3-MA for the indicated durations.FIGURE 2Cysmethynil treatment impacts on tumor growth in vivo. A, mice bearing PC3 cell-derived xenograft tumors were treated with vehicle (▪), 0.1 mg/g of cysmethynil (▴), or 0.2 mg/g of cysmethynil (•) every 48 h as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Each treatment group consisted of eight animals, and the data shown represent the mean and standard deviation of each group. The complete experiment has been repeated twice with similar results. B, body weight measurement of experimental animals. Body weight determinations were performed on animals from both experiments noted in A; the data shown represent the mean and standard deviation for the vehicle (▪) and 0.2 mg/g of cysmethynil (•) treatment groups.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min, whereupon the cells were then fixed in ice cold 70% ethanol overnight before being resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 40 μg/ml propidium iodide and 0.1 mg/ml Ribonuclease A (both from Sigma) for 1 h at 37°C. Fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry analysis using an Excalibur Instrument (BD Biosciences). Immunofluorescence of LC3—Cells subjected to the indicated treatments were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton using a standard protocol (18Spector D.L. Smith H.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 163: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Incubation with primary antibody to LC3 (MAP1LC3B, Abgent) was performed at 4 °C overnight before incubation with Rho-damine Red-X secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Analysis was performed using an Olympus fluorescent microscope fitted with the appropriate excitation and emission filters. Acridine Orange Staining for Autophagy Detection—Acridine orange (Sigma) staining was performed according to a published protocol (19Kanzawa T. Kondo Y. Ito H. Kondo S. Germano I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2103-2108PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then stained with 1 μm/ml acridine orange for 15 min at 37 °C. Analysis was performed via fluorescence microscopy using 490-nm band-pass blue excitation filters and a 515-nm long-pass barrier filter. In the study of the effect of bafilomycin co-treatment, cells were treated with 200 nm bafilomycin A1 for 40 min prior to the addition of acridine orange. Atg5 Knockdown—Stealth® siRNA duplex oligoribonucleotides targeting Atg5 (Invitrogen) were resuspended to make a 20 μm solution following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections were carried out using the Lipofectamine 2000 protocol provided by Invitrogen. Conditions were optimized with varying ratios of Lipofectamine and RNA, as well as different time intervals after the transfections as determined by immunoblot analysis of atg5 protein levels. Cell proliferation on both the atg5 siRNA-treated cells and the mock-transfected cells was then assessed using the assay described above. Cysmethynil Treatment of Xenograft-harboring Mice—PC3 cells were grown in DMEM and 10% fetal calf serum until near confluence and then harvested with a standard method using trypsin. Cells (5 × 106) were then mixed with Matrigel® (BD Biosciences) to achieve 40% Matrigel in the final solution. The cell preparation was then injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 6–8-week-old SCID mice. For treatment, cysmethynil was prepared in 4% DMSO, 1.4% Tween 80, and 1% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (Sigma) normal saline solution; the vehicle control was with the same mixture lacking cysmethynil. In a preliminary acute toxicity study, mice were injected intraperitoneally with vehicle control, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 mg/g of cysmethynil. The control, the 0.1 mg/g-, and the 0.2 mg/g-injected mice showed few signs of distress after the injection. The 0.3 mg/g and higher dosings resulted in sluggishness and diarrhea in the first 24 h after injection, although all recovered 2 days after injection. Based on the acute toxicity study, cysmethynil was dosed at 0.1 and 0.2 mg/g in two groups, together with the control group, at 48-h intervals. The animals were monitored for their general appearance and health, as well as body weight. Subcutaneous tumors were measured with the standard clipper ruler method. Final tumor weight at the end of the study was documented after animal sacrifice and dissection of tumor tissue. Miscellaneous Procedures—Icmt activity was determined by the in vitro assay described previously (17Baron R.A. Casey P.J. BMC Biochem. 2004; 5: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Baron R.A. Peterson Y.K. Otto J.C. Rudolph J. Casey P.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay was carried out using recombinant Icmt produced in Sf9 cells, biotin S-farnesylcysteine as the prenylcysteine substrate, and [3H]S-adenosylmethionine. Apoptosis was assessed by determination of activation of caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-2 through immunoblot analysis, DNA fragmentation assay, and microscopic observation of the abnormalities of nuclei stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole as described (21Morishima N. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To perform immunoblot analysis, cells subjected to the indicated treatment were harvested and lysed, and protein concentration was determined by Micro BCA® protein assay (Pierce). Proteins were separated by 14% SDS-PAGE, and subsequent immunoblot procedures were performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence procedure (GE Healthcare) per the manufacturer's instructions. Cysmethynil Exhibits Mechanism-based Antiproliferative Activity toward Prostate Cancer Cells—To facilitate a rapid evaluation of the mechanism-based consequences of cysmethynil treatment on cells, we sought a structural analog of the compound that lacked activity toward the enzyme. Molecular modeling of available structure-activity data on the chemical series from which cysmethynil was identified (22Leow J.L. Baron R. Casey P.J. Go M.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2007; 17: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) suggested that the amide portion of the indole ring might be important in this activity. An analog lacking only the amide portion was synthesized, termed J3 (Fig. 1A), and evaluated for in vitro activity toward Icmt. This analysis, shown in Fig. 1B, revealed that the J3 analog was essentially devoid of Icmt inhibitory activity despite its chemical similarity to cysmethynil. The impact of treatment, by cysmethynil and the inactive J3 analog, on the prostate cancer-derived cell line PC3 was evaluated using a cell viability assay. Cysmethynil treatment resulted in a dose- and time-dependent reduction in the number of viable PC3 cells, whereas the J3 analog at the highest corresponding dose was ineffective (Fig. 1C). These data, along with a previous study using a colon cancer cell line in which the antiproliferative activity of cysmethynil was markedly diminished by overexpression of Icmt in the cells (11Winter-Vann A.M. Baron R.A. Wong W. dela Cruz J. York J.D. Gooden D.M. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. Toone E.J. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4336-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), provide compelling evidence that the impact of cysmethynil treatment on cells is directly due to inhibition of Icmt. An additional finding from this study is that at moderate dosage, cysmethynil appears to exhibit primarily cytostatic activity, whereas at higher concentrations, both cytostatic and cytotoxic activity are observed (Fig. 1C). Cysmethynil Is Efficacious in Controlling Tumor Growth in a Xenograft Mouse Model of Prostate Cancer—To investigate the ability of cysmethynil to inhibit tumor growth in vivo, we first conducted a dose escalation toxicity trial in Balb/C mice and found that an intraperitoneal dose of less than 0.3 mg/g was well tolerated. We then established a xenograft model of PC3 cells in SCID mice. Tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously in the flank. When tumors started to increase in size (usually 100–200 mm3), confirming the successful grafting of the tumor cells, mice were randomly assigned to control (vehicle) and cysmethynil treatment groups. Mice thus bearing established PC3 tumors were given intraperitoneal injections of vehicle only, 0.1 or 0.2 mg/g of cysmethynil every 48 h for 28 days. The duration of the experiments were dictated by the tumor burden of the control mice. As shown in Fig. 2A, both doses of cysmethynil significantly suppressed the growth of PC3 tumors when compared with the vehicle control group. Neither dose was accompanied by any appreciable toxicity as assessed by body weight determinations of the treated mice when compared with the control group (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that pharmacological inhibition of Icmt in vivo significantly impacts on tumor growth and further reinforces the notion of Icmt as an anticancer drug target. Cysmethynil Treatment Induces Cell Cycle Arrest in PC3 cells—As noted in the Introduction, there is considerable evidence that inhibition of CaaX protein processing by either of the protein prenyltransferases can impact on cell cycle progression. This information, coupled with the finding that moderate doses of cysmethynil have apparently predominant cytostatic activity on PC3 cells (Fig. 1C), prompted us to examine more closely cell cycle parameters in cells treated with this Icmt inhibitor. Flow cytometry analysis of PC3 cells treated 48 h with 20 μm cysmethynil showed a significantly increased population of cells in G1 (Fig. 3A). Further examination of molecular markers associated with G1 arrest showed remarkable changes, including increased p27 levels, reduced cyclin D1 levels, and showed almost complete loss of phospho-Rb (Fig. 3B). These data are all consistent with the G1 arrest observed in the flow cytometry analysis. Cysmethynil Treatment Induces Autophagic Cell Death—Although the ability of cysmethynil treatment to trigger a G1 arrest in PC3 cells could account for the cytostatic capacity of this compound, the reduction in cell count following longer term and higher dose treatments in vitro suggested that an increase in cell death was also being triggered by Icmt inhibition. Our initial set of experiments to examine this potential outcome of cysmethynil treatment was focused on apoptotic pathways since as noted above, inhibition of CaaX protein processing had been linked to elevated apoptosis in many cells types (6Sebti S.M. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 297-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, no consistent impact of cysmethynil treatment at the concentration of cysmethynil that decreased the number of viable cells was observed on apoptotic markers such as caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-2 cleavage in the treated PC3 cells (data not shown). Additionally, neither DNA fragmentation nor abnormal nuclear morphology was observed in PC3 cells following cysmethynil treatment at the concentration that resulted in cell death (not shown), arguing against a significant contribution of apoptosis to diminished cell viability. The inability to link apoptosis to the cell death observed in the PC3 cells following cysmethynil treatment prompted us to consider whether the drug induced a non-apoptotic form of cell death. Specifically, we examined autophagy, a process that involves the degradation of cellular components through an autophagosome-lysosome pathway, as this process has recently become appreciated as important in cell growth and survival (14Kondo Y. Kanzawa T. Sawaya R. Kondo S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). Indeed, cysmethynil treatment of PC3 cells resulted in a dramatic elevation of the LC3-II protein (Fig. 4A), which is characteristic for the activation of autophagic pathway (23Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar). Further cell-based analysis employing anti-LC3 immunofluorescence revealed that the LC3 protein in drug-treated cells both increased in total abundance and also aggregated into granular/vesicular structures (Fig. 4B), consistent with the expected changes that signal autophagosome formation (23Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar). Since different cell types exhibit varying degrees of autophagocytosis at baseline (14Kondo Y. Kanzawa T. Sawaya R. Kondo S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar), we quantified the autophagosomes in the cysmethyniland vehicle-treated cells by determination of the fraction of cells exhibiting elevated level of LC3 aggregation; this quantitation showed that cysmethynil treatment significantly elevated cellular abundance of autophagosomes (35% versus 2%, Fig. 4B). The process of autophagy starts with the autophagosome formation and then progresses to autophagolysosomes through the fusion of acidic lysosomes with autophagosomes (15Hippert M.M. O'Toole P.S. Thorburn A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9349-9351Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Therefore, acridine orange staining of the live cells was also employed to visualize acidic autophagolysosomes in control and cysmethynil-treated PC3 cells. As shown in Fig. 4C, cysmethynil treatment markedly elevated the amount of autophagolysosomes in the cells, providing further evidence that the autophagic process was being activated by drug treatment and that the autophagosome formation is not the result of the inhibition of lysosomal fusion. Bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of vacuolar H+ ATPase, prevents the transition of autophagosome to autophagolysosomes by disrupting the fusion of autophagosomes to lysosomes (24Yamamoto A. Tagawa Y. Yoshimori T. Moriyama Y. Masaki R. Tashiro Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1998; 23: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Hence, bafilomycin A1 provides a useful way of studying the autophagy process. The treatment of the PC3 cells with bafilomycin A1 markedly reduced the quantity of acridine orange-positive vesicles (Fig. 4C), confirming that the autophagosomes produced by the treatment of cysmethynil undergo the same maturation process with the fusion with lysosomes. Indeed, in the bafilomycin A1-treated cells, LC3-II levels remain elevated despite a marked reduction of acidic vesicles (not shown), indicating that the earlier stages of autophagy prior to lysosomal fusion were not affected by this lysosome fusion inhibitor. Inhibition of Autophagy Protects PC3 Cells from Cell Death Elicited by Cysmethynil Treatment—To assess whether the induction of autophagy observed in cysmethynil-treated PC3 cells actually contributed to the cell death elicited by treatment with the compound, we first assessed whether 3-MA, a known inhibitor of autophagy that acts through inhibition of type 3 PI3 kinase (25Blommaart E.F. Krause U. Schellens J.P. Vreeling-Sindelarova H. Meijer A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), could alleviate cysmethynil-induced cell death. PC3 cells were treated with vehicle alone, cysmethynil, 3-MA alone, or 3-MA plus cysmethynil, and viability of the cells was assessed 72 h later. As seen in Fig. 5A, 3-MA treatment alone had little impact on cell viability; the viability of cysmethynil-treated cells was markedly increased if 3-MA was present during the course of the treatment. Immunoblot analysis showed that the cells treated with both 3-MA and cysmethynil had much lower levels of the autophagy marker LC3-II when compared with the cells treated with cysmethynil alone, suggesting that the autophagic process stimulated by cysmethynil is subjected to the regulation by type 3 PI 3-kinase (Fig. 5A). We also employed a knockdown strategy to impair autophagy to further assess its impact on cysmethynil-induced cell death. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of atg5, a crucial component of the autophagy cascade (14Kondo Y. Kanzawa T. Sawaya R. Kondo S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar), markedly reduced cell death elicited by cysmethynil treatment (Fig. 5B). This has provided additional evidence supporting a crucial role for autophagy-dependent cell death in the efficacy of cysmethynil. Knockdown of atg5 also resulted in the reduction of LC3-II production in cysmethynil-treated cells (Fig. 5B), confirming a direct impact of the knockdown on the autophagic process in the cells. Taken together, the survival benefits achieved with both 3-MA treatment and atg5 RNA knockdown in the cysmethynil-treated PC3 cells provide compelling evidence that cysmethynil not only induces autophagy but that the accompanying autophagy-dependent cell death contributes significantly to the efficacy of cysmethynil in inducing cancer cell death. Cysmethynil Treatment Impacts on mTOR Signaling in PC3 Cells—The data presented above indicate that cysmethynil treatment induces both G1 cell cycle arrest and autophagy; a common link of these two processes is that they can be modulated by mTOR signaling. Two types of CaaX proteins are known to be important in regulating mTOR signaling, Ras GTPases and the Rheb GTPase. Ras activates PI 3-kinase, leading to the activation of Akt, which in turn activates Rheb by inhibiting tuberous sclerosis complex, a negative regulator of Rheb. Rheb positively regulates mTOR kinase, with a resultant positive impact on cell cycle progression and negative impact on autophagy (26Easton J.B. Houghton P.J. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6436-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Ras methylation has been shown to impair Ras activity (11Winter-Vann A.M. Baron R.A. Wong W. dela Cruz J. York J.D. Gooden D.M. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. Toone E.J. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4336-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); Rheb could also be affected by Icmt inhibition, and this could further impact mTOR signaling. Indeed, cysmethynil treatment of PC3 cells resulted in a marked reduction of phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 6A), as would be expected from inhibition of Ras. In addition, phosphorylation of the mTOR downstream effector ribosomal protein S6 was markedly reduced in cysmethynil-treated cells, and another effector, 4EBP1, showed the characteristic shift in phosphorylation pattern consistent with inhibition of the mTOR kinase (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, Rheb levels in PC3 cells were markedly reduced following 48 h of cysmethynil treatment, providing evidence that the general availability and activity of Rheb GTPase were reduced. Based on these data, we propose a model whereby inhibition of Icmt leads to a reduction of Ras and Rheb activity and consequent inhibition of Akt and mTOR signaling, contributing to the effects on cell cycle progression and autophagy (Fig. 6B). Autophagy as a means of induction of cancer cell death has attracted increasing attention recently, especially in circumstances of apoptosis-resistant cancer cells. For example, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin has been reported to induce cell death through autophagy in glioblastoma cell lines that are resistant to many therapies that induce apoptosis (27Takeuchi H. Kondo Y. Fujiwara K. Kanzawa T. Aoki H. Mills G.B. Kondo S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3336-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In this regard as well, a recent study showed that temozolomide treatment alone of glioblastoma cell lines causes autophagic cell death (28Kanzawa T. Germano I.M. Komata T. Ito H. Kondo Y. Kondo S. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Although the realization that autophagic cell death may be an important component of the action of certain cancer drugs is relatively new, the connection between the PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibition and autophagy induction has been well established (14Kondo Y. Kanzawa T. Sawaya R. Kondo S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway activation enhances cell proliferation, survival, and growth and inhibits autophagy in many cells, and aberrant up-regulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis has been frequently linked to oncogenesis in many cancers (29Sawyers C.L. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 343-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In many cases, up-regulation of the pathway has been linked to loss of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) phosphatase. Although these aberrancies do contribute to resistance to therapies many cancers, they might also render the cancers more sensitive to mTOR inhibition, as the sustained activation would render the cells more dependent on this pathway for proliferation (21Morishima N. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 30Neshat M.S. Mellinghoff I.K. Tran C. Stiles B. Thomas G. Petersen R. Frost P. Gibbons J.J. Wu H. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10314-10319Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). On this note, the PC3 prostate cancer cell used in the current studies is PTEN-null and exhibits elevated intrinsic PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, which likely contributes to the resistance of this cell line to a variety of therapeutic interventions. The efficient induction of autophagic cell death by cysmethynil suggests that the inhibition of the CaaX protein processing in this group of more resistant cancers could provide an effective therapeutic alternative, or enhancement of, existing chemotherapies. Targeting mTOR signaling by cysmethynil makes use of two fundamental mechanisms of treating cancer, induction of cell death (through autophagy) and inhibition of cell cycle progression. Inhibiting mTOR blocks the phosphorylation of two key downstream effectors, p70S6 kinase and 4EBP1. Both proteins play important roles in translational regulation; in particular, inhibition of expression of the G1 cell cycle regulatory protein cyclin D1 leads to G1 arrest in cells in which mTOR is inhibited (30Neshat M.S. Mellinghoff I.K. Tran C. Stiles B. Thomas G. Petersen R. Frost P. Gibbons J.J. Wu H. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10314-10319Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The ability of cysmethynil to induce G1 arrest as well as autophagy could make it broadly applicable as an anticancer agent. The identification of cysmethynil as a specific and bioavailable Icmt inhibitor provides a selective tool to probe the involvement of Icmt in both normal and pathological cellular processes. The current study not only strengthens the rationale for targeting Icmt as an anticancer strategy from a mechanistic standpoint but also demonstrates significant in vivo efficacy of cysmethynil through its administration to mice bearing xenograft prostate cancer-derived tumors. Our data clearly indicate that an induction of autophagy by cysmethynil is a major contributor to the cell death that accompanies pharmacological inhibition of Icmt. Although the specific CaaX protein(s) underlying this phenomenon have not yet been unambiguously identified, the Ras and Rheb GTPases are potential players due to their abilities to control PI 3-kinase and mTOR signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2049973825,"The metastatic spread of a tumor is dependent upon the ability of the tumor to stimulate surrounding stromal cells to express enzymes required for tissue remodeling. The immunoglobulin superfamily protein basigin (EMMPRIN/CD147) is a cell surface glycoprotein expressed by tumor cells that stimulates matrix metalloproteinase and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in stromal cells. The ability of basigin to stimulate expression of molecules involved in tissue remodeling and angiogenesis makes basigin a potential target for the development of strategies to block metastasis. However, the identity of the cell surface receptor for basigin remains controversial. The goal of this study was to determine the identity of the receptor for basigin. Using a novel recombinant basigin protein (rBSG) corresponding to the extracellular domain of basigin, it was demonstrated that the native, nonglycosylated rBSG protein forms dimers in solution. Furthermore, rBSG binds to the surface of uterine fibroblasts, activates the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, and induces expression of matrix metalloproteinases 1, 2, and 3. Proteins that interact with rBSG were isolated using a biotin label transfer technique and sequenced by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization tandem mass spectrophotometry. The results demonstrate that rBSG interacts with basigin expressed on the surface of fibroblasts and is subsequently internalized. During internalization, rBSG associates with a novel form of human basigin (basigin-3). It was concluded that cell surface basigin functions as a membrane receptor for soluble basigin and this homophilic interaction is not dependent upon glycosylation of the basigin ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1975727171,"Background Gut ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a serious condition in intensive care patients. Activation of immune cells adjacent to the huge endothelial cell surface area of the intestinal microvasculature produces initially local and then systemic inflammatory responses. Stimulation of the vagus nerve can rapidly attenuate systemic inflammatory responses through inhibiting the activation of macrophages and endothelial cells. Ghrelin, a novel orexigenic hormone, is produced predominately in the gastrointestinal system. Ghrelin receptors are expressed at a high density in the dorsal vagal complex of the brain stem. In this study, we investigated the regulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway by the novel gastrointestinal hormone, ghrelin, after gut I/R. Methods and Findings Gut ischemia was induced by placing a microvascular clip across the superior mesenteric artery for 90 min in male adult rats. Our results showed that ghrelin levels were significantly reduced after gut I/R and that ghrelin administration inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine release, reduced neutrophil infiltration, ameliorated intestinal barrier dysfunction, attenuated organ injury, and improved survival after gut I/R. Administration of a specific ghrelin receptor antagonist worsened gut I/R-induced organ injury and mortality. To determine whether ghrelin's beneficial effects after gut I/R require the intact vagus nerve, vagotomy was performed in sham and gut I/R animals immediately prior to the induction of gut ischemia. Our result showed that vagotomy completely eliminated ghrelin's beneficial effect after gut I/R. To further confirm that ghrelin's beneficial effects after gut I/R are mediated through the central nervous system, intracerebroventricular administration of ghrelin was performed at the beginning of reperfusion after 90-min gut ischemia. Our result showed that intracerebroventricular injection of ghrelin also protected the rats from gut I/R injury. Conclusions These findings suggest that ghrelin attenuates excessive inflammation and reduces organ injury after gut I/R through activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway."

Relaxins signal through two different classes of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), leucine-rich repeat-containing GPCRs LGR7 and LGR8 together with GPCR135 and GPCR142, now referred to as the relaxin family peptide (RXFP) receptors 1–4, respectively. Although key binding residues have been identified in the B-chain of the relaxin peptides, the role of the A-chain in their activity is currently unknown. A recent study showed that INSL3 can be truncated at the N terminus of its A-chain by up to 9 residues without affecting the binding affinity to its receptor RXFP2 while becoming a high affinity antagonist. This suggests that the N terminus of the INSL3 A-chain contains residues essential for RXFP2 activation. In this study, we have synthesized A-chain truncated human relaxin-2 and -3 (H2 and H3) relaxin peptides, characterized their structure by both CD and NMR spectroscopy, and tested their binding and cAMP activities on RXFP1, RXFP2, and RXFP3. In stark contrast to INSL3, A-chain-truncated H2 relaxin peptides lost RXFP1 and RXFP2 binding affinity and concurrently cAMP-stimulatory activity. H3 relaxin A-chain-truncated peptides displayed similar properties on RXFP1, highlighting a similar binding mechanism for H2 and H3 relaxin. In contrast, A-chain-truncated H3 relaxin peptides showed identical activity on RXFP3, highlighting that the B-chain is the sole determinant of the H3 relaxin-RXFP3 interaction.

Relaxin was first identified more than 90 years ago and subsequently shown to be a peptide hormone having a two-chain structure similar to insulin (Fig. 1) (1Schwabe C. McDonald J.K. Science. 1977; 197: 914-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It has since been established that relaxin is a member of the relaxin peptide family, comprising a total of seven members in the human (2Bathgate R.A.D. Hsueh A.J. Sherwood O.D. Neill J.D. Physiology of Reproduction. 3rd Ed. Elsevier, San Diego2006: 679-770Google Scholar).

H2, and H3 relaxin peptides that are encoded by the three relaxin genes RLN1 to -3 and the insulin-like peptides INSL3 to -6 (insulin-like peptides 3–6). Phylogenetic analyses indicate that all of these relaxin family peptides evolved from a relaxin-3 (H3 relaxin equivalent) ancestral gene prior to the emergence of fish (3Wilkinson T.N. Speed T.P. Tregear G.W. Bathgate R.A.D. BMC Evol. Biol. 2005; 5: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In most mammals other than humans and higher primates, there are only two relaxin genes that encode relaxin and relaxin-3. The RLN1 gene in these species is equivalent to the RLN2 gene in humans (encoding H2 relaxin) and higher primates and encodes the relaxin peptide that is expressed by the corpus luteum and/or placenta (2Bathgate R.A.D. Hsueh A.J. Sherwood O.D. Neill J.D. Physiology of Reproduction. 3rd Ed. Elsevier, San Diego2006: 679-770Google Scholar). The function of the RLN1 gene in higher primates is unknown, and an H1 relaxin peptide has not been isolated.In contrast to the receptors for insulin and insulin-like growth factors I and II, which are tyrosine kinases, the receptors for relaxin family peptides are members of two unrelated branches of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. LGR7 (leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor) is the receptor for relaxin and is characterized by an unusually large ectodomain that terminates with a low density lipoprotein receptor class A module (4Hsu S.Y. Nakabayashi K. Nishi S. Kumagai J. Kudo M. Sherwood O.D. Hsueh A.J. Science. 2002; 295: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Relaxin also has high affinity for the related receptor, LGR8, which is the receptor for INSL3 (5Kumagai J. Hsu S.Y. Matsumi H. Roh J.S. Fu P. Wade J.D. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31283-31286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The native receptor for H3 relaxin is the unrelated receptor GPCR135, also known as the somatostatin- and angiotensin-like peptide receptor (6Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Jornvall H. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50754-50764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). H3 relaxin also has high affinity for the related receptor GPCR142, which is the receptor for INSL5 (7Liu C. Kuei C. Sutton S. Chen J. Bonaventure P. Wu J. Nepomuceno D. Wilkinson T. Bathgate R. Eriste E. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 292-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Both receptors are classic peptide ligand GPCRs and lack a large ectodomain. Importantly, H3 relaxin has a high affinity for LGR7 and will also interact with LGR8, albeit with a significantly lower affinity (8Bathgate R.A.D. Lin F. Hanson N.F. Otvos Jr., L. Guidolin A. Giannakis C. Bastiras S. Layfield S.L. Ferraro T. Ma S. Zhao C. Gundlach A.L. Samuel C.S. Tregear G.W. Wade J.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and hence will interact with all of the relaxin family receptors. Neither INSL4 (9Lin F. Otvos Jr., L. Kumagai J. Tregear G.W. Bathgate R.A. Wade J.D. J. Pept. Sci. 2004; 10: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) nor INSL6 (10Bogatcheva N.V. Truong A. Feng S. Engel W. Adham I.M. Agoulnik A.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2639-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) can bind to the relaxin family receptors, and their native receptors are unknown. Based on IUPHAR-NC nomenclature, the receptors were recently named relaxin family peptide (RXFP) receptors: LGR7-RXFP1, LGR8-RXFP2, GPCR135-RXFP3, and GPCR142-RXFP4 (11Bathgate R.A. Ivell R. Sanborn B.M. Sherwood O.D. Summers R.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 7-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar).The determinants for H3 relaxin activity on RXFP3 and RXFP4 are probably located in the B-chain alone, since synthetic S-reduced H3 relaxin B-chain is an RXFP3 and RXFP4 agonist (12Liu C. Chen J. Sutton S. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50765-50770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 13Liu C. Chen J. Kuei C. Sutton S. Nepomuceno D. Bonaventure P. Lovenberg T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It has recently been demonstrated that key residues in the H3 relaxin B-chain are responsible for both binding affinity and cAMP-inhibitory activity (14Kuei C. Sutton S. Bonaventure P. Pudiak C. Shelton J. Zhu J. Nepomuceno D. Wu J. Chen J. Kamme F. Seierstad M. Hack M.D. Bathgate R.A. Hossain M.A. Wade J.D. Atack J. Lovenberg T.W. Liu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25425-25435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Further, a series of chimeric peptides that consist of the B-chain of H3 relaxin in combination with A-chains from other members of the relaxin family demonstrated that the A-chain from H1 relaxin, H2 relaxin, INSL3, and INSL6 does not change the pharmacological properties of the H3 relaxin B-chain significantly. However, substitution of the relaxin-3 A-chain with the A-chain from INSL5 results in a chimeric peptide that selectively activates RXFP3 over RXFP1 (13Liu C. Chen J. Kuei C. Sutton S. Nepomuceno D. Bonaventure P. Lovenberg T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Hence, although the A-chain of H3 relaxin is not necessary for RXFP3/4 activity, it is essential for RXFP1 activity.Similarly, H2 relaxin and INSL3 require both A- and B-chains for RXFP1 and RXFP2 activation. Ligand-mediated activation of RXFP1 and RXFP2 involves a three-stage process (15Scott D.J. Layfield S. Yan Y. Sudo S. Hsueh A.J. Tregear G.W. Bathgate R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34942-34954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Primary ligand binding occurs in the leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) of the receptor ectodomain, and there is a lower affinity secondary binding site in the transmembrane exoloops (16Sudo S. Kumagai J. Nishi S. Layfield S. Ferraro T. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7855-7862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Receptor signaling through cAMP then requires the unique low density lipoprotein receptor class A module at the N terminus of the receptors (15Scott D.J. Layfield S. Yan Y. Sudo S. Hsueh A.J. Tregear G.W. Bathgate R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34942-34954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). RXFP1 and RXFP2 receptors without this domain bind ligand normally but do not signal. A recent study has shown that the B-chain of relaxin binds to specific residues in the RXFP1 receptor LRRs (17Bullesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14051-14056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This interaction is determined by the arginine residues at B13 and B17 and an isoleucine or valine at position B20 within the B-chain forming a “relaxin binding cassette” (Arg-X-X-X-Arg-X-X-Ile/Val) (18Bullesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35276-35280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have recently demonstrated that the INSL3 B-chain interacts with specific residues in the RXFP2 receptor LRRs (19Scott D.J. Wilkinson T.N. Zhang S. Ferraro T. Wade J.D. Tregear G.W. Bathgate R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1699-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Primary ligand binding to the LRRs is directed by the B-chain-specific residues HisB12, ArgB16, ValB19, ArgB20, and TrpB27 (20Rosengren K.J. Zhang S. Lin F. Daly N.L. Scott D.J. Hughes R.A. Bathgate R.A. Craik D.J. Wade J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 38: 28287-28295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Importantly, B-chain-only INSL3 peptides can bind to the primary binding sites in the LRRs but do not activate the receptor (21Del Borgo M.P. Hughes R.A. Bathgate R.A. Lin F. Kawamura K. Wade J.D. J.

These peptides are low affinity antagonists and highlight that the A-chain is required for receptor activation.Very little is known about the residues involved in secondary binding to the receptors, although it is known that this site has a lower affinity for the ligand and is necessary for receptor activation (22Halls M.L. Bathgate R.A. Sudo S. Kumagai J. Bond C.P. Summers R.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1041: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that INSL3 can be truncated at the N terminus of its A-chain by up to 9 residues without affecting RXFP2 binding affinity (23Bullesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14586-14590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, this truncated peptide does not stimulate cAMP signaling and in fact acts as a high affinity antagonist. It is therefore possible that the N-terminal region of the INSL3 A-chain is somehow involved in the secondary interactions with the RXFP2 receptor, which are necessary for receptor activation.Similarly, it has previously been shown that the N terminus of the A-chain of porcine relaxin is important for its activity on the mouse pubic symphysis (24Bullesbach E.E. Schwabe C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5998-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Deletion of more than 3 amino acids resulted in the loss of the ability of porcine relaxin to relax the pubic symphysis. However, the role of the N-terminal A-chain residues in H2 relaxin upon RXFP1 and RXFP2 receptor binding and activation as well as the role of these residues in H3 relaxin upon RXFP1 and RXFP3 binding and activation is unknown. In this study, we have synthesized H2 and H3 relaxin peptides with A-chain truncations to examine whether the N terminus of the A-chain of the relaxin peptides is important for peptide structure, receptor binding, and/or activation. H2 relaxin A-chain-shortened analogs were tested for binding and activation on RXFP1 and RXFP2 only, since H2 relaxin does not bind to RXFP3 (6Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Jornvall H. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50754-50764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). H3 relaxin A-chain shortened analogs were tested for binding and activation on RXFP1 and RXFP3 only, since H3 relaxin has a poor affinity for, and does not activate, RXFP2 (22Halls M.L. Bathgate R.A. Sudo S. Kumagai J. Bond C.P. Summers R.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1041: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that there are significant differences in the mechanisms by which the various relaxin family peptides activate their receptors. These data provide important new biochemical insights into the action of relaxin peptides.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSolid Phase Peptide Synthesis—Appropriately regioselectively S-protected individual A- and B-chains of H2, H3, INSL3, and their analogs were prepared as their C-terminal amide forms using either continuous flow or microwave-assisted solid phase methodology on an automated PerSeptive Biosystems peptide synthesizer and a CEM Liberty peptide synthesizer, respectively. After simultaneous cleavage, side chain deprotection, and purification of the individual chains, use of a previously reported sequential disulfide bond formation strategy (8Bathgate R.A.D. Lin F. Hanson N.F. Otvos Jr., L. Guidolin A. Giannakis C. Bastiras S. Layfield S.L. Ferraro T. Ma S. Zhao C. Gundlach A.L. Samuel C.S. Tregear G.W. Wade J.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) led to the production of the following A-chain-truncated relaxin analogs: A-(5–24) H3, A-(7–24) H3, A-(8–24) H3, A-(9–24) H3, A-(10–24) H3, Ala-4 A-(9–24) H3, Ala-5 A-(9–24) H3, A-(5–24) H2, A-(7–24) H2, A-(9–24) H2, Ala-4 A-(9–24) H2, Ala-5 A-(9–24) H2 (Fig. 1). Additionally, the A-chain-truncated INSL3 analogs A-(9–26) INSL3 and A-(10–24) INSL3 were also prepared. The native B-chains of H2, H3, and INSL3 were used in each case. The overall yield was ∼5% for H3 analogs, 6% for the INSL3 analogs, and ∼10–15% for H2 analogs relative to the starting B-chain peptide.Peptide Characterization—The purity of each synthetic peptide was assessed by analytical reverse phase HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a Bruker Autoflex II instrument (Bremen, Germany) in the linear mode at 19.5 kV. Peptides were quantitated by amino acid analysis of a 24-h acid hydrolysate using a GBC instrument (Melbourne, Australia).Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO (J-185; Tokyo, Japan) spectrophotometer at 25 °C using a 1-mm path length cell. The peptides were dissolved in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at a concentration of 0.01 or 0.1 mg/ml.NMR Structural Analysis—The truncated analogues A-(9–24) H2, A-(10–24) H3, and A-(10–24) INSL3 were each analyzed by solution NMR spectroscopy. For each of the peptides, 0.5-ml samples containing 1, 0.5, and ∼1 mg, respectively, in the solvent system 90% H2O, 10% D2O at pH ∼4 were prepared. Two-dimensional homonuclear data, including TOCSY, NOESY, and DQF-COSY, were recorded at 600 and 900 MHz on Bruker Avance spectrometers. All two-dimensional spectra were generally recorded with 4000 data points in the direct dimension and 512 increments in the indirect dimension, which was zero-filled to 1000 data points prior to transformation. For A-(9–24) H2 relaxin, a series of TOCSY spectra were recorded at 288, 293, 298, 303, and 308 K in order to determine the amide temperature dependence. A temperature coefficient of >-4.6 ppb/K was considered indicative of a hydrogen bond (25Cierpicki T. Zhukov I. Byrd R.A. Otlewski J. J. Magn. Reson. 2002; 157: 178-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Based on this analysis, the following hydrogen bond donors were identified: A15, B5, B9, B10, B12, B19, B21, and B22. Additional data for structural restraints were also recorded on a lyophilized sample redissolved in 100% D2O.Structural restraints for structure calculations included interproton distances derived from a NOESY spectrum recorded at 900 MHz with a mixing time of 150 ms. Dihedral angle restraints of -100 ± 80° were introduced for ϕ angles, where a positive angle could be excluded based on a stronger interresidual Hαi- 1-HNi than intra-Hαi-HNi NOE. Hydrogen bond restraints were introduced where hydrogen bonds could be identified based on temperature coefficients in combination with preliminary structures. Preliminary structures were calculated using torsion angle dynamics within the program CYANA (26Guntert P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 353-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). The final structures were generated by torsion angle dynamics within CNS followed by Cartesian dynamics and refinement in explicit water as described in detail previously (27Rosengren K.J. Daly N.L.

Chem. 2003; 278: 8606-8616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).Binding Assays—Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T cells stably transfected with RXFP1 and RXFP2 (8Bathgate R.A.D.

Competition binding experiments were performed as previously described with either 100 pm 33P-labeled H2 relaxin (8Bathgate R.A.D. Lin F. Hanson N.F. Otvos Jr., L. Guidolin A. Giannakis C. Bastiras S. Layfield S.L. Ferraro T. Ma S. Zhao C. Gundlach A.L. Samuel C.S. Tregear G.W. Wade J.D.

Nonspecific binding was determined with an excess of unlabeled peptides (500 nm H2 relaxin or INSL3).CHO-K1 cells stably expressing RXFP3 (29Van Der Westhuizen E.T. Sexton P.M. Bathgate R.A. Summers R.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1041: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Crude membrane preparations were prepared for competition binding curves using 100 pm 125I-labeled H3 relaxin B chain-INSL5 A-chain chimeric peptide (kindly labeled by Dr. Steve Sutton) as previously described (13Liu C. Chen J. Kuei C. Sutton S. Nepomuceno D. Bonaventure P. Lovenberg T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of 500 nm H3 relaxin.All data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of the percentage of the total specific binding of triplicate wells, repeated in at least three separate experiments, and curves were fitted using onesite binding curves in Graphpad Prism 4 (Graphpad Software). Statistical differences in pIC50 values were analyzed using Student's t tests in Graphpad Prism 4.Inhibition of Forskolin-induced Intracellular cAMP Accumulation—The influence of the various ligands on cAMP signaling in cells expressing RXFP receptors was assessed using a cAMP reporter gene assay as previously described (15Scott D.J. Layfield S. Yan Y. Sudo S. Hsueh A.J. Tregear G.W. Bathgate R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34942-34954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK-293T cells in 96-well plates were co-transfected with either RXFP1 or RXFP2 and a pCRE-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (30Chen W. Shields T.S. Stork P.J. Cone R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). 24 h later, co-transfected cells were treated with increasing concentrations of H2 relaxin, H3 relaxin, or INSL3 analogs in parallel with 10 nm H2 relaxin or INSL3 for RXFP1- or RXFP2-transfected cells, respectively. In addition, INSL3 analogs were tested for their ability to block 1 nm INSL3 stimulation over 6 h. CHO-K1 cells in 96-well plates were co-transfected with RXFP3 and the pCRE-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid, and 24 h later, they were treated with 5 μm forskolin together with increasing concentrations of H3 relaxin analogs. 10 nm H3 relaxin was used for maximal stimulation, whereas untreated cells were used as controls. After 6 h, the cell medium was aspirated, and the cells were frozen at -80 °C overnight. The amount of cAMP-driven β-galactosidase expression in each well was determined as previously described. Ligand-induced stimulation of cAMP was expressed as a percentage of the maximum H2 relaxin, INSL3, and H3 relaxin response for RXFP1, RXFP2, and RXFP3 cells, respectively. Data points were measured in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times.RESULTSSynthesis of Relaxin AnalogsA number of INSL3, H2, and H3 relaxin analogues as outlined in Fig. 1 were prepared for functional and structural studies. In all cases, a highly efficient solid phase peptide synthesis strategy using regioselectively S-protected relaxin or INSL3 A- and B-chains followed by sequential disulfide bond formation was utilized (8Bathgate R.A.D. Lin F. Hanson N.F. Otvos Jr., L. Guidolin A. Giannakis C. Bastiras S. Layfield S.L. Ferraro T. Ma S. Zhao C. Gundlach A.L. Samuel C.S. Tregear G.W. Wade J.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This method assures a good overall yield and avoids a tedious and labor-intensive random oxidation method. Each peptide was comprehensively chemically characterized, including by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and high purity was confirmed.A-chain-shortened INSL3 AnalogsAnalogs of INSL3 were first prepared to confirm the reported effects of A-chain shortening on the INSL3 peptide in our RXFP2-expressing cell line. As previously reported (23Bullesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14586-14590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), A-(9–26) INSL3 demonstrated equivalent binding affinity to native INSL3 (Fig. 2, A and B). Additionally, a further truncated analog A-(10–24) INSL3 also showed high binding affinity, although it was significantly lower (p < 0.001) than both native INSL3 and A-(9–26) INSL3 (Fig. 2, A and B). Neither peptide was able to stimulate cAMP in RXFP2-expressing cells (data not shown); however, they were both able to dose-dependently inhibit INSL3-meditated cAMP signaling (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Activity of A-chain truncated INSL3 analogs.

Analogs A-(8–24) H3, A-(9–24) H3, and A-(10–24) H3 relaxin all demonstrated high affinity binding to RXFP3-expressing cells (Fig. 3A and Table 1). Additionally, they were all able to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP production with a potency similar to that of native H3 relaxin (Fig. 3B). Hence, A-chain shortening had no effect on H3 relaxin activity on RXFP3.FIGURE 3Activity of the A-chain-truncated H3 relaxin analogs on RXFP3.

It is widely distributed in mycobacteria, however, where it is important in energy metabolism, and in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is implicated in redox processes related to non-replicating persistence.

The World Health Organization estimates that 1.6 million people die of the disease each year and one-third of the world population is currently infected with the TB bacillus. Current TB chemotherapy comprises a 6-month-long regimen, and no new drug has been introduced into this regimen for more than 30 years (1Duncan K. Barry III, C.E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PA-824, a nitroimidazopyran, is a promising anti-TB compound currently undergoing clinical trial with the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development. The compound exhibits potent bactericidal activity against both growing and dormant Mtb and requires reductive, bacterial activation that has been shown to occur via a F420-dependent mechanism (2Stover C.K. Warrener P. VanDevanter D.R. Sherman D.R. Arain T.M. Langhorne M.H. Anderson S.W. Towell J.A. Yuan Y. McMurray D.N. Kreiswirth B.N. Barry C.E. Baker W.R. Nature. 2000; 405: 962-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). A comparison of Mtb strains susceptible or resistant to PA-824 revealed that mutations in the open reading frame Rv0407, encoding FGD1 (F420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 1), result in PA-824 resistance (2Stover C.K. Warrener P. VanDevanter D.R. Sherman D.R. Arain T.M. Langhorne M.H. Anderson S.W. Towell J.A. Yuan Y. McMurray D.N. Kreiswirth B.N. Barry C.E. Baker W.R. Nature. 2000; 405: 962-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that FGD1 does not interact directly with the compound but, rather, provides reduced F420 to an accessory protein (Rv3547), which in turn activates PA-824 (3Manjunatha U.H. Boshoff H. Dowd C.S. Zhang L. Albert T.J. Norton T.J. Daniels L. Dick T. Pang S.S. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The unusual coenzyme F420 (a 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin electron transfer agent) consists of an isoalloxazine chromophore with a side chain comprising ribitol, phosphate, and lactate residues and a poly-glutamate tail of variable length (Fig. 1). Originally isolated from methanogenic Archaea (4Cheeseman P. Toms-Wood A. Wolfe R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 527-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), F420 was discovered in Mtb in the mid-1980s (5Daniels L. Bakhiet N. Harmon K. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1985; 6: 12-17Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and was subsequently found to be widely distributed in Mycobacterium species (6Purwantini E. Daniels L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2861-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). F420 is used in a variety of roles in different organisms; that is, energy generation in Archaea, antibiotic biosynthesis pathways in Streptomyces species, and DNA photoreactivation reactions in Scenedesmus and Synechocystis species (7Isabelle D. Simpson D.R. Daniels L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 5750-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In Mycobacterium and Nocardia species, it is used by F420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases (FGDs) (6Purwantini E. Daniels L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2861-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Purwantini E. Gillis T. Daniels L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 146: 129-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), two of which (FGD1 and FGD2) are present in Mtb. Aside from the absolute requirement for F420 and FGD1 in the activation of PA-824, the role of F420 in Mtb is not well understood. However, the redox potential of F420 (-380 mV) is lower than that of the classical hydrogen carrier NAD(P)+ (-320 mV), and it has been hypothesized that reduced F420 in Mtb may have an important role in low-redox potential reactions that would be associated with anaerobic survival and persistence (9Boshoff H.I. Barry III, C.E. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Reduction of the F420 coenzyme is achieved by hydride transfer from a substrate molecule to C5 of the 5′-deazaflavin (10Walsh C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1985; 19: 216-221Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). There is relatively little structural information, however, on the factors that facilitate this reaction. Although crystal structures are available for a small number of F420-dependent enzymes, only for three proteins has the mode of F420 binding been defined; they are a secondary alcohol dehydrogenase (Adf), a methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin reductase (Mer), and an F H 420 2:NADP+ oxidoreductase (Fno), all from methanogenic Archaea (11Aufhammer S.W.

Shima S. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1840-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) that might be expected also in FGD1. The substrates in these proteins vary widely, however, and the sections of polypeptide that enclose the active sites appear to vary significantly. Catalysis depends critically on the relationship between substrate and coenzyme binding, in distance, orientation, and conformation. Given its role in the development of resistance to PA-824 and its likely importance in mycobacterial physiology, we sought to determine the structural determinants of FGD1 function. Here we describe the three-dimensional structure of Mtb FGD1 determined by x-ray crystallography at 1.9 Å resolution both with and without bound F420 and in the presence of a bound citrate ion, which is shown to be a competitive inhibitor of substrate binding. These structures together with kinetic and spectroscopic analyses and in silico modeling of substrate binding allow the development of a hypothesis for hydride transfer between the substrate and cofactor, the occurrence of which is crucial for PA-824 activation in Mtb. Cloning, Expression, Purification, and Crystallization of ApoFGD1—Native and selenomethionine-substituted FGD1 overexpressed in the Mycobacterium smegmatis strain mc24517 using the expression vector pYUB1049 and were purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography (15Bashiri G. Squire C.J. Baker E.N. Moreland N.J. Protein Expression Purif. 2007; 54: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The N-terminal polyhistidine tag, added by the expression vector and used for affinity purification, was not cleaved and remained on the protein in subsequent crystallization and functional experiments. Selenomethionine-substituted FGD1 crystals were grown as described (15Bashiri G. Squire C.J. Baker E.N. Moreland N.J. Protein Expression Purif. 2007; 54: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in a solution containing 1.4 m trisodium citrate, pH 6.5, and 0.1% dioxane. The crystals are monoclinic, space group P21, with unit cell dimensions a = 80.95, b = 89.13, c = 90.86 Å, and β = 91.64°, and the asymmetric unit contains four FGD1 protomers. Data Collection and Structure Determination of ApoFGD1—For data collection, the crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen after being placed in a cryoprotectant comprising 70% N-paratone, 30% mineral oil. Se-MAD data sets were collected at three wavelengths (0.97929, 0.91162, and 0.97941 Å) at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (beamline 9-2 with a MarMosaic-325 CCD detector). A further dataset was collected from a selenomethionine-substituted crystal using a Rigaku rotating copper anode (λ = 1.5418 Å) and a Mar-Research dtb345 image plate detector. Data were processed with HKL2000 (16Otwinoski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38572) Google Scholar) or MOSFLM and SCALA from the CCP4 program suite (17Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Open table in a new tab The structure of FGD1 was solved by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion methods. Selenium sites were found using SHELXD (18Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar), which located 28 of the expected 36 sites. Selenium position refinement and phase calculation were performed by SHARP (19de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar), and density modification was performed by SOLOMON (20Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). The majority of the model was built by PHENIX (21Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K. Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23384) Google Scholar). Water molecules were identified by their spherical electron density (height greater than 3σ in Fo - Fc maps or 1σ in 2Fo - Fc maps) and appropriate hydrogen bond geometry with surrounding structure. Refinement was carried out using REFMAC5 (23Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar, 24Winn M. Isupov M. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; 57: 122-133Crossref Scopus (1651) Google Scholar); statistics are shown in Table 1. The final model, refined at 1.9 Å resolution with R = 0.212 and Rfree = 0.255, contains residues 3-334 (of the expected 336) for three monomers and residues 1-334 plus 12 residues of the N-terminal His tag for the fourth monomer (A). The Ramachandran plot produced by PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) shows that 91.3% of all residues fall in the preferred regions, and there are no outliers. In the analysis of the structure, hydrogen bonds were inferred where bond distances of 2.5-3.4 Å and bond angles greater than 90° at the donor H or acceptor O/N atoms were found. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination of FGD1 Complexes—The complex structure with F420 was obtained by soaking native FGD1 crystals with F420 purified from M. smegmatis and a substrate analog. The substrate analog, 1,5-anhydro-d-glucitol 6-phosphate, was synthesized by phosphorylating 1,5-anhydro-d-glucitol (Toronto Research Chemicals) using hexokinase (Sigma) as previously reported (26Ferrari R.A. Mandelstam P. Crane R.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 80: 372-377Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). FGD1 crystals were transferred into sitting drops containing 1.2 m tri-sodium citrate, pH 6.5, 1 mm F420, and 50 mm substrate analog and incubated overnight. The crystals were flash-frozen as above, and data to 1.95 Å resolution were collected in-house at 110 K. Data were processed using HKL2000 (16Otwinoski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). The crystals were orthorhombic, space group P21212, with unit cell a = 91.07, b = 89.90, c = 80.14 Å and two FGD1 protomers per asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with PHASER (27McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) using the 1.9 Å SeMet apoFGD1 structure as search model. Refinement with REFMAC5 (23Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) showed electron density for F420 in both monomers. Non-protein electron density was also observed adjacent to the F420 in each monomer and was modeled as citrate. The final model, with R = 0.183 and Rfree = 0.231, comprises residues 3-334 of each monomer, two F420 molecules, and two citrate ions (Table 1). F420 Purification—The F420 coenzyme was purified from large scale preparations of M. smegmatis mc24517 cells, grown to high density in a 3-liter fermentor or in 2-liter baffled flasks, by organic solvent extraction, ion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography as described (7Isabelle D. Simpson D.R. Daniels L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 5750-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The absorption of F420 at 400 nm (ϵ400 = 25 mm-1 cm-1) was used to determine its concentration (28Jacobson F.S. Daniels L. Fox J.A. Walsh C.T. Orme-Johnson W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3385-3388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of the purified F420 was then verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization reflection time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry on a Voyager DE-PRO mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Samples were co-crystallized with α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid and analyzed in negative ion mode using an accelerating voltage of 20,000 V and a delay time of 150 ns. The instrument was calibrated with CalMix#1 (Applied Biosystems; angiotensin I, Glufibrinopeptide B, and neurotensin). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed on a SpectraMAX microplate spectrofluorimeter (Molecular Devices). Excitation and emission wavelengths of 420 and 480 nm, respectively, were used to monitor F420 fluorescence (29Eirich L.D. Vogels G.D. Wolfe R.S. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4583-4593Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 30Eirich L.D. Vogels G.D. Wolfe R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 40: 20-27Crossref Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in 96-well format (Greiner bio-one, Germany) with total reaction volumes of 100 μl. To determine the optimal pH for F420 binding, FGD1 (5 μm) and F420 (10 μm) were incubated in buffer solutions with a pH range of 4-9 (0.5 steps) for 1 h at room temperature before fluorescence analysis. Reactions contained 50 mm buffer, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-ME, and 1 mm EDTA and were corrected against a control lacking FGD1. The optimal pH for F420 binding was found to be 6.5-7.0, and pH 7.0 was used in subsequent fluorescence experiments. To determine the dissociation constant for F420 binding to FGD1, F420 (0-25 μm) and FGD1 (100 μm) were mixed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-ME, and 1 mm EDTA and incubated as above. Ligand binding data were fitted with SigmaPlot v10 (Systat Software Inc.) using a one-site saturation model, ΔF = ((ΔF . max [ligand])/(KD + [Ligand])), where ΔF is the normalized change in fluorescence compared with a solution of 100 μm protein alone, ΔFmax is the maximum normalized change in fluorescence at saturation, KD is the dissociation constant, and [ligand] is the concentration of ligand. Absorbance-based Assays—FGD1 activity was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy on a SpectraMAX microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). The decrease of F420 absorbance at 420 nm was monitored over 10 min in all activity assays. All reactions contained 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-ME, and 1 mm EDTA and were performed in 96-well format (Greiner bio-one, Germany). Kinetic studies with the substrate glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) were performed using 100 nm FGD1, 20 μm F420, and varying concentrations of G6P (0.01-1 mm). The Km was determined using the same one-site saturation model used for KD, where rate replaces ΔF, and Km replaces KD. The inhibitory effect of citrate on FGD1 activity was assayed using 100 nm FGD1, 20 μm F420, 100 μm G6P, and varying concentrations of citrate (100 nm-20 μm). The experimental data were fitted, and IC50 values were calculated using SigmaPlot v10 and a one-site competition model. In Silico Docking—Both α- and β-anomers of G6P were constructed and energy-minimized in the molecular modeling package SYBYL7.3 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). Both α- and β-d-G6P were docked without constraints into the FGD1 active site using GOLD (31Verdonk M.L. Cole J.C. Hartshorn M.J. Murray C.W. Taylor R.D. Proteins. 2003; 52: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar). The top 10 solutions were visualized and assessed on the basis of their interactions with the protein and F420. A model of the reaction product, 6-phosphogluconolactone, bound to FGD1 was also produced by altering the coordinates of the docked G6P and energy minimizing in SYBYL7.3. FGD1 Expression, Crystallization, and Cofactor Preparation—M. tuberculosis FGD1 was overexpressed in M. smegmatis and crystallized in citrate buffer supplemented with dioxane. Subsequent preparations in minimal media supplemented with selenomethionine gave crystals of the SeMet-substituted protein that were used for structure determination by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction methods. The F420 used in functional assays and crystallographic binding experiments was purified from M. smegmatis cell extracts, with a typical yield of 100 μg of F420 per liter of culture. Analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry shows that the F420 isolated from M. smegmatis contains up to nine glutamate residues, although the predominant species has six (Fig. 2), in line with previously published analyses which indicated five or six glutamates (32Bair T.B. Isabelle D.W. Daniels L. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 176: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). FGD1 Overall Structure—The crystal structure of apoFGD1, determined at 1.90 Å resolution, comprises four molecules in the asymmetric unit arranged as two independent homodimers. The liganded structure, containing F420 and citrate and refined at 1.95 Å resolution, contains two molecules in each asymmetric unit which form the same biological dimer. Superposition of the monomer structures shows little difference between the apo and liganded forms, with an overall root mean square difference in Cα atomic positions of 0.78 Å over all 332 residues. The largest local differences are in solvated loop regions and areas involved in crystal packing. Each monomer of FGD1, comprising residues 3-334, forms an (α/β)8 TIM-barrel, in which the active site is located as usual at the C-terminal end of each barrel (Fig. 3A). One molecule each of F420 and citrate bind deeply in the active site of the liganded structure (Fig. 3B), occupying a cavity measuring ∼950 Å3, as calculated by the Computed Atlas of Surface Topography of Proteins, CASTp (33Dundas J. Ouyang Z. Tseng J. Binkowski A. Turpaz Y. Liang J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). The two monomers that comprise the FGD1 dimer are related by an approximate 2-fold axis parallel with the central β-strands and associate by the interaction of three α-helices, α1, α2, and α3, and associated loops. The dimer interface, as analyzed by the program PISA (34Krissinel E. Henrick K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6838) Google Scholar), buries 2022 Å2 or 15% of each monomer surface and contains 29 hydrogen bonds and 22 salt bridges. A search of the Protein Data Bank with SSM (35Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3166) Google Scholar) shows that FGD1 most closely matches proteins of the bacterial luciferase family (11Aufhammer S.W. Warkentin E. Berk H. Shima S. Thauer R.K. Ermler U. Structure. 2004; 12: 361-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 36Fisher A.J. Thompson T.B. Thoden J.B. Baldwin T.O. Rayment I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21956-21968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), as expected from its 20-30% sequence identity with other family members. This family includes FMN- and F420-dependent oxidoreductases which act on a diverse range of substrates. The SSM analysis shows that the F420-dependent enzymes form a distinct subgroup within the family, comprising FGD1, Adf, and Mer. The closest structural homologue to FGD1 is Adf (11Aufhammer S.W. Warkentin E. Berk H. Shima S. Thauer R.K. Ermler U. Structure. 2004; 12: 361-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which shares not only the same monomer fold but also the same dimer association; the root mean square difference is 1.68 Å for 639 Cα atoms of the dimer. As in the other bacterial luciferase family members, three insertion segments (IS1, IS2, and IS3) “cap” the C-terminal end of the barrel, folding over the active site to form the substrate binding pocket. Multiple sequence alignments (Fig. 4) highlight sequence variations in these insertion segments and structural differences in the capping region correlate with different substrate specificity. This is most apparent in FGD1 for the phosphate binding pocket described later. A large deviation between FGD1 and Adf is found in the loop region Thr195-Glu201, which includes two key residues that contact citrate in our liganded structure or the G6P phosphate in our modeled structure. In the area around the F420 binding site, particularly the isoalloxazine system, differences are small and indicate a strong conservation of structure associated with F420 binding and in the barrel core. Active Site-F420 Binding—The F420 cofactor binds in the active site, with its three-ring isoalloxazine system innermost and its poly-glutamate tail extending into the solvent. As in Adf (11Aufhammer S.W. Warkentin E. Berk H. Shima S. Thauer R.K. Ermler U. Structure. 2004; 12: 361-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and Mer (12Aufhammer S.W. Warkentin E. Ermler U. Hagemeier C.H. Thauer R.K. Shima S. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1840-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the isoalloxazine ring binds adjacent to a bulge in strand β3 containing a non-prolyl cis-peptide bond that joins Ser73 and Val74 in FGD1. Analogous non-prolyl cis-peptide bonds are found in some but not all other proteins of the bacterial luciferase family (11Aufhammer S.W. Warkentin E. Berk H. Shima S. Thauer R.K. Ermler U. Structure. 2004; 12: 361-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recognition of the isoalloxazine ring depends on shape through non-bonded contacts described below together with a number of specific hydrogen bonds that primarily involve the pyrimidine ring (Fig. 5A). The latter makes highly favorable hydrogen bonds with the main chain CO and NH groups of Asp39, the side chains of Thr76 and Asn112, and two buried water molecules. The ribitol and phosphate groups make a few hydrogen bonds with protein atoms, primarily from the polypeptide backbone, but are less tightly enclosed, and the polyglutamate tail exits the active site cavity at the first glutamate, with no further residues being visible. A striking feature of F420 binding in FGD1 is the pronounced butterfly conformation of the isoalloxazine ring system (Fig. 5C), which is caused by steric contacts from the surrounding structure. As in Adf and Mer, the non-prolyl cis-peptide β-bulge packs against the chromophore from behind (the Re-face), at the center of the ring system; contacts are made by the carbonyl oxygen of Ser73 and the side chain of Val74. Additional interactions with the other face (the Si-face) at its two extremities then cause bending about an axis between the C5 and N3 atoms. At one end of the isoalloxazine system, the pyrimidine ring occupies a tight pocket formed by His40, Glu109, the protein backbone, and two ordered waters. At the other end the primary contact of the hydroxybenzyl ring is with the citrate ion, which occupies the substrate binding pocket, as described below. The C5 atom of the central pyridine ring faces into this substrate binding pocket and to proposed catalytic residues (see later), consistent with experimental data showing that the catalytic mechanism has Si-face stereospecificity at carbon C5 (37Klein A.R. Berk H. Purwantini E. Daniels L. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Overall, the butterfly bend of 162° is similar to that seen for F420 bound to Adf but differs in detail, with a smaller angle between pyrimidine and pyridine rings and a larger angle between pyridine and hydroxybenzyl, the inverse of what is seen for Adf. The major difference is that no hydrophobic residues restrain the hydroxybenzyl ring, as occurs in Adf; instead, this ring is restrained in FGD1 by steric interactions with the citrate ion. Active Site-Citrate Binding—A bound citrate ion, presumably derived from the crystallization medium, is located immediately adjacent to the F420 molecule, occupying a cavity measuring ∼460 Å3, m"
https://openalex.org/W2084699782,"We recently described a novel antimicrobial peptide, RTA3, derived from the commensal organism Streptococcus mitis, with strong anti-Gram-negative activity, low salt sensitivity, and minimal mammalian cell toxicity in vitro and in vivo. This peptide conforms to the positively charged, amphipathic helical peptide motif, but has a positively charged amino acid (Arg-5) on the nonpolar face of the helical structure that is induced upon membrane binding. We surmised that disruption of the hydrophobic face with a positively charged residue plays a role in minimizing eukaryotic cell toxicity, and we tested this using a mutant with an R5L substitution. The greatly enhanced toxicity in the mutant peptide correlated with its ability to bind and adopt helical conformations upon interacting with neutral membranes; the wild type peptide RTA3 did not bind to neutral membranes (binding constant reduced by at least 1000-fold). Spectroscopic analysis indicates that disruption of the hydrophobic face of the parent peptide is accommodated in negatively charged membranes without partial peptide unfolding. These observations apply generally to amphipathic helical peptides of this class as we obtained similar results with a peptide and mutant pair (Chen, Y., Mant, C. T., Farmer, S. W., Hancock, R. E., Vasil, M. L., and Hodges, R. S. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 12316–12329) having similar structural properties. In contrast to previous interpretations, we demonstrate that these peptides simply do not bind well to membranes (like those of eukaryotes) with exclusively neutral lipids in their external bilayer leaflet. We highlight a significant role for tryptophan in promoting binding of amphipathic helical peptides to neutral bilayers, augmenting the arsenal of strategies to reduce mammalian toxicity in antimicrobial peptides.

We highlight a significant role for tryptophan in promoting binding of amphipathic helical peptides to neutral bilayers, augmenting the arsenal of strategies to reduce mammalian toxicity in antimicrobial peptides. During the last 15–20 years, the growing problem of resistance to classical antibiotics has focused attention on novel classes of antimicrobial molecules (1Palumbi S.R.

One of these is the broad group of antimicrobial peptides that constitute the first line of defense against invading organisms in higher animals (4Hancock R.E. Lehrer R.

Two general features of these peptides are that they are amphipathic (adopting conformations that separate polar and nonpolar surface to match the polar-nonpolar interfacial regions of cell membranes) and are positively charged (promoting interaction with the negatively charged membranes of prokaryotic cells). Antimicrobial peptides are effective at low micromolar concentrations against a broad range of microorganisms, including in many cases those resistant to traditional antibiotics (4Hancock R.E.

Rev. 2006; 19: 491-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar). In general, however, therapeutic applications of these peptides have been hindered by several problems, perhaps the most important being toxicity, cost of production, and bioavailability. Continuing advances in peptide synthesis and purification, combined with economies of scale in large volume syntheses, indicate that the cost of therapeutics based on peptides of relevant size (12–20 amino acid residues) is less of an issue than in the past (9Bray B.L. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Bioavailability problems are likely to be overcome with peptides showing genuine promise (for example by using d-amino acid versions of effective peptides (10Chen Y. Vasil A.I. Rehaume L. Mant C.T. Burns J.L. Vasil M.L. Hancock R.E.W. Hodges R.S. Chem. Biol. Drug Des. 2006; 67: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)). Toxicity, however, remains a limiting factor in peptide antimicrobial use. This is illustrated by the observation that antimicrobial peptides are rarely effective in animal studies at doses below ∼10–20 mg kg–1. Because peptides of this class so far cannot be administered orally, this therapeutic dose requires injections of significant volumes of peptide at concentrations of 1 or 2 mg ml–1, corresponding to concentrations in the millimolar range. Thus, although the effective dose as determined by MICs 2The abbreviations used are: MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; CF, carboxyfluorescein; FPE, fluorescein phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; SUV, small unilamellar vesicle. 2The abbreviations used are: MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; CF, carboxyfluorescein; FPE, fluorescein phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; SUV, small unilamellar vesicle. may be in the low micromolar range, the dosing methods require that peptides have low eukaryotic cell toxicity at rather high concentrations. Partly as a result of these considerations, first generation antimicrobials based on peptides derived from animal or bacterial sources have been limited to topical use (e.g. pexaganin based on magainin from frog skin (11Ge Y. MacDonald D.L. Holroyd K.J. Thornsberry C. Wexler H. Zasloff M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 782-788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) or are chemically modified to reduce in vivo toxicity (colistin methanosulfonate in which the active form of the peptide is probably the unmethanosulfonated form resulting from loss of side chain protection in vivo (12Bergen P.J. Li J. Rayner C.R. Nation R.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 1953-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar)).A promising approach to the development of safer peptide antimicrobials is the identification of peptides secreted internally in animals (13Hancock R.E.W. Scott M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8856-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 14Ganz T. Nat. Rev.

Immunol. 2004; 5: 836-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) or from commensal organisms in animals. In these cases the natural evolutionary systems will be expected to have generated effective sequences with low toxicity. Although the direct therapeutic use of endogenous peptides might itself be problematic because of the potential promotion of resistance against parts of the endogenous immune system (16Perron G.G. Zasloff M. Bell G. Proc. Biol. Sci. 2006; 273: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), the development of peptide antimicrobials incorporating structural themes from endogenous peptides is expected to be useful.We have recently described such a peptide, RTA3, based on the identification of antimicrobial activity in the commensal organism, Streptococcus mitis. 3Hawrani, A., Dempsey, C. E., Howe, R. A., and Walsh, T. R., presented at the 47th ICAAC Meeting, Chicago, IL, September 17–20, 2007, abstracts F1658–F1661. 3Hawrani, A., Dempsey, C. E., Howe, R. A., and Walsh, T. R., presented at the 47th ICAAC Meeting, Chicago, IL, September 17–20, 2007, abstracts F1658–F1661. This peptide (see Fig. 1) was based on a gene sequence discovered while investigating anti-Pseudomonas activity in sputa from cystic fibrosis patients. Although the putative parent peptide, upon synthesis, was highly salt-sensitive, a modification to RTA3 based on systematic alanine scan mutagenesis and sequence changes based on rational design principles proved to retain high anti-Pseudomonas activity, low salt sensitivity, high activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial strains, and extremely low eukaryotic cell toxicity.The low toxicity of RTA3 has prompted further investigation, because understanding its molecular basis will enhance the prospects for developments in the antimicrobial peptide field. We surmised that the very low toxicity might be related to the observation that the amphipathic nature of RTA3 is disrupted by a charged and polar residue (Arg-5) that falls on the nonpolar face of the amphipathic helix (see Fig. 1), which is formed when the peptide encounters the target cell membrane. Note that although residue 1 is also an Arg, and appears to fall on the nonpolar face, this residue, in a membrane surface-localized helical peptide (17Hristova K. Dempsey C.E. White S.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 801-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), can re-position itself in the polar regions of the membrane interface by helix “fraying” that is often encountered in the interaction of interfacially localized helical peptide with membranes (18Dempsey C.E. Butler G.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11973-11977Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 19Halsall A. Dempsey C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 901-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To address the role of the Arg-5 residue and the effects of disrupting the nonpolar face of the helical peptide, we have prepared tryptophan-substituted versions of RTA3 (RTA3-F4W) and a variant (RTA3-F4W,R5L) in which the strict amphipathic helical amino acid distribution is recovered, and we tested the membrane binding and biological activities of this peptide (the F4W substitution was introduced to facilitate membrane binding studies). To determine whether the observations on this peptide pair are generally applicable, we have also synthesized a previously described (20Chen Y. Mant C.T. Farmer S.W. Hancock R.E. Vasil M.L. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12316-12329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) pair of peptides, V681 (an antimicrobial amphipathic helical peptide with high eukaryotic cell toxicity), and a mutant, V681-V13K (Fig. 1), that had suppressed eukaryotic cell toxicity upon disruption of the nonpolar helix face, and we tested their interactions with membranes of varying composition. In contrast to previous explanations involving the subtle dispositions of the peptides in membranes of different compositions, we find that disruption of the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic helical peptides in wild type RTA3 and the mutant V681-V13K reduces eukaryotic cell toxicity because of a greatly reduced affinity for neutral membranes, which is particularly marked for RTA3. Surprisingly, each of the peptides with a disrupted hydrophobic surface appears to bind to negatively charged membranes without major disruption of helical conformations to move the positively charged side chain (Arg or Lys) from its apparent location on the nonpolar surface directed toward the membrane interior. The results also highlight a significant role for tryptophan in promoting helical peptide binding to neutral phospholipid membranes, and thus promoting eukaryotic cell toxicity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptide Synthesis, Purification, and Characterization—The peptides listed in Table 1 were synthesized by Dr. G. Bloomberg of the Bristol Centre for Molecular Recognition using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase synthesis. The peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and were confirmed to be at least 97% pure by analytical high pressure liquid chromatography and to have the predicted m/e ratio by mass spectrometry. Phospholipids were from Lipid Products (Nutfield, UK); carboxyfluorescein (CF) was from Sigma, and fluorescein-phosphatidylethanolamine (FPE) was from Avanti Polar Lipids.TABLE 1Biological activities of the peptidesMICHemolytic activity80 μg ml-12.5 mg ml-1μg ml-1μm%RTA3 (RTA3-dis)8426RTA3-F4W (WRTA3-dis)42421RTA3-F4W,R5L (WRTA3-non-dis)8480100V681-V13K (V681-dis)82.5566V681 (V681-non-dis)82.5100100 Open table in a new tab Biological Activities—MICs of the peptides were determined by broth microdilution according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (21Clinical and Laboratory Standards InstituteMethods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically, Approved Standard,6th Ed. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, Wayne, PA2003Google Scholar). 100 μl of 0.5–1 × 106 colony-forming units per ml of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Mueller Hilton media (plus cations) broth (BD Biosciences) were incubated in 96-well microtiter plates with serial 2-fold dilutions of the peptides. MICs were defined as the lowest peptide concentration with no visible growth of bacteria from the MIC microtiter plates after 24 h at 37 °C. Hemolytic activity was determined by incubating 10% (v/v) suspension of horse erythrocytes with peptides. Erythrocytes were rinsed in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, by repeated centrifugation and resuspension (3 min at 3000 × g). Erythrocytes were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in either deionized water (fully hemolyzed control), phosphate-buffered saline, or with peptide in phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was separated from the pellet and the absorbance measured at 570 nm. Absorbance of the suspension treated with deionized water defined complete hemolysis.Preparation of Lipid Vesicles—All experiments were performed at room temperature. Small unilamellar vesicles (100 nm diameter) were used for all spectroscopic measurements except for CD spectroscopy for which smaller (50 nm) vesicles were used to minimize light scattering effects. Lipids were dried from chloroform:methanol solution and pumped under high vacuum overnight to remove traces of solvent. Dried lipids were hydrated at a concentration of 10 mg ml–1 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing either 107 mm NaCl (buffer A) or, for the CF dye-release experiments, 50 mm CF. Vesicles doped with FPE were prepared similarly except that 0.5 mol % of FPE in methanol was added to the lipids in organic solvent before drying. Hydrated lipids were extruded 10 times through two 100 or 50 nm pore membranes, using a Lipex Biomolecular extruder (Vancouver, Canada). Vesicles for CD and peptide binding, monitored using either tryptophan fluorescence or FPE fluorescence, were used directly. Vesicles for CF dye-release measurements were used after gel filtration on a Sephadex G-15 column with buffer A as the mobile phase, to remove non-trapped CF. Thus in all experiments, interaction of the peptide with vesicles was determined in the same buffer (buffer A).Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence measurements were made using a SPEX Fluoromax fluorimeter. Peptide solutions were made in plastic tubes or cuvettes to minimize loss of peptide at low concentrations because of binding to glass surfaces. For the measurement of vesicle-induced changes in the emission spectra of tryptophan in Trp-containing peptides, a 2 μm peptide solution was incubated in buffer A, and aliquots of vesicles suspension were added to give total lipid concentrations in the range 0 to 300 μm total lipid. Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 280 nm, and the emission spectrum was measured between 300 and 450 nm in 1-nm increments with 1-s signal averaging. Binding data were fitted to a simple hyperbolic function to obtain estimates of the maximum fluorescence emission blue shift (Δλmax) and the concentration of lipid at which the lipid-induced blue shift was half-maximal.Peptide binding to FPE-labeled vesicles was measured by adding aliquots of peptide to a suspension of vesicles at 65 μm total lipid concentration in buffer A. FPE emission was measured at 520 nm (excitation at 490 nm). The experiments were made by adding successive aliquots of peptide to a single vesicle sample. Control experiments showed that the same FPE fluorescence enhancement was obtained by adding a single large aliquot of peptide or the same amount of peptide in successive small aliquots; the latter method facilitates analysis of peptide binding at low peptide concentrations allowing an assessment of the extent to which binding is cooperative (22Dempsey C.E. Ueno S. Avison M.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 402-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Peptide-induced dye release from vesicles loaded with CF was measured from the loss of CF self-quenching as the dye dilutes into the extravesicular medium. Experiments were done with the same lipid concentration (65 μm) as the FPE binding measurements and in buffer A so that data from the different experiments can be interpreted in a consistent manner. CF emission was measured at 520 nm (excitation at 490 nm). The fluorescence resulting from 100% release of encapsulated CF was determined by adding 10 μl of 20% Triton X-100. To ensure rapid mixing of peptide and vesicles, and to avoid high local concentrations of peptide, 1 ml of a peptide solution at double the post-mix concentration was rapidly ejected from an Eppendorf pipette into 1 ml of a vesicle suspension at 130 μm concentration (65 μm post mix) to initiate binding and dye release. The fluorescence emission intensity was measured 3 min after mixing CF-loaded vesicles with peptide.Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were obtained at 20 °C using a Jobin-Yvon CD6 spectropolarimeter. All samples were made in buffer A. Spectra of peptides in solution were measured in 1- or 2-mm quartz cuvettes. Spectra in the presence of vesicles were measured in 0.1-mm path length cuvettes to minimize light scattering contributions. All spectra are averages of 5 (vesicle-free solutions) or 9–11 scans (peptides plus vesicles) with appropriate peptide-free blank spectra subtracted and were zeroed at 260 nm before plotting without smoothing. Peptide helix content was calculated from the ellipticity at 222 nm (θ222) (23Dempsey C.E. Piggot T.J. Mason P.E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) using parameters determined by Luo and Baldwin (24Luo P.Z. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8413-8421Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar).RESULTSPeptide Nomenclature and Biological Activities of PeptidesThe experiments described below were designed to compare the membrane binding properties of two sets of peptides, each set comprising a peptide(s) having the nonpolar helix face disrupted by a positively charged Arg or Lys residue (RTA3-dis; WRTA3-dis and V681-dis), and the other of the set having a nondisrupted helix face (WRTA3-non-dis and V681-non-dis). We have employed the “dis”/“non-dis” designation here to simplify the terminology of these peptides, particularly because the “wild type” RTA3 peptide (RTA3-dis) has a disrupted (dis) nonpolar helix face, whereas it is the “mutant” V681 peptide (V681-V13K or V681-dis) that has the disrupted (dis) nonpolar helix face. We synthesized F4W variants of the RTA peptides (WRTA3-dis and WRTA3-non-dis), in which the Phe-4 residue was replaced with a tryptophan, for two reasons. First, to obtain accurate peptide concentrations that are important for quantitative interpretation of CD data. Second, the presence of a tryptophan residue allows quantitative analysis of peptide binding to lipid vesicles through the effects of binding on tryptophan fluorescence. V681 already contains a tryptophan (Trp-2) in its “native” sequence (Fig. 1).The minimum inhibitory concentrations against P. aeruginosa and the hemolytic activities of the peptides are given in Table 1 and Fig. 2. We present hemolysis data up to very high concentrations that are relevant for in vivo dosing considerations as described in the Introduction.FIGURE 2Concentration dependence of hemolytic activity of the peptides. Peptides have either nondisrupted nonpolar helical faces (V681 (▪) and RTA3-F4W,R5L (•)), or nonpolar helical faces disrupted by a positively charged amino acid residue (V681-V13K (□); RTA3 (○); and RTA3-F4W (Δ)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Peptides with disrupted nonpolar helical faces have greatly reduced hemolytic activity while retaining anti-Pseudomonas activity similar to that of the equivalent peptide having a nondisrupted nonpolar helix face. The latter peptides have very high hemolytic activity. These observations are generally consistent with the results on V681 and V681-V13K previously described by Chen et al. (20Chen Y. Mant C.T. Farmer S.W. Hancock R.E. Vasil M.L. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12316-12329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Two important observations that we explore below are the extremely low hemolytic activity of wild type RTA3 at very high concentrations, and the significantly enhanced hemolytic activity of the analog of RTA3 in which the Phe-4 residue is replaced with a tryptophan (Table 1; Fig. 2).Conformational Transitions upon Membrane BindingEach of the peptides in Fig. 1 is unstructured in buffer A as indicated by a “random coil” CD spectrum (not shown). Fig. 3A shows that both WRTA3-dis and WRTA3-non-dis adopt helical structure upon binding to membrane vesicles composed of 50% PC and 50% PG in buffer A. The helical content was around 78% in each case, which is very similar to the maximum helical content induced by these peptides in 40% trifluoroethanol (in buffer A; data not shown), which generally induces a maximum helix content in peptides with moderate to high helix-forming potential (24Luo P.Z. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8413-8421Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The high concentrations of peptide (150 μm) and lipid (10 mm) required for adequate spectroscopic CD data are expected to promote peptide binding to lipid, and for the strongly binding peptides the CD signal should be representative of the conformation of the peptide in its membrane-bound state. The equivalence of the helix content in membrane-bound forms of WRTA3-dis and WRTA3-non-dis indicates that the presence of an Arg residue on the hydrophobic face of the otherwise amphipathic helix does not detectably disrupt helical conformations when WRTA3-dis binds to a negatively charged membrane (50% PC:PG).FIGURE 3Circular dichroism spectra of RTA3 peptides (A) and V681 peptides (B) in the presence of phospholipid vesicles in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 107 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 20 °C. Peptide concentrations were 150 μm, and total lipid concentrations were 10 mm. For both panels, filled symbols denote peptide spectra in the presence PC vesicles, and open circles denote peptide spectra in the presence of vesicles composed of PC:PG (50:50, mol/mol). Squares are peptides with nondisrupted helical faces (WRTA3-non dis in A, and V681-non-dis in B); circles are peptides with disrupted helical faces (WRTA3-dis in A, and V681-dis in B), and RTA3-dis is denoted by triangles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)WRTA3-dis adopts minimal helical structure (around 10%) when incubated at very high concentrations with vesicles composed exclusively of PC (Fig. 3A). However, if the Arg-5 residue in WRTA3-dis is replaced with a leucine (in WRTA3-non-dis), a helical conformation (82%) is induced, presumably as a result of membrane binding, that is essentially equivalent to that induced by interaction of both WRTA3-dis and WRTA3-non-dis with negatively charged membrane vesicles (50% PC, 50% PG). The small but measurable helical content of WRTA3-dis is interesting in view of the complete absence of helical content in RTA3-dis (wild type RTA3) when incubated with high concentrations of vesicles composed of neutral lipid (Fig. 3A). This observation indicates that the apparently conservative replacement of the Phe-4 residue of RTA3-dis with a Trp results in measurable differences in the interaction of RTA3-dis and WRTA3-dis with neutral membranes.Similar observations were made with the wild typeV681-non-dis and V681-dis mutant (V681-V13K) that has the disrupted nonpolar helix face (Fig. 3B). Each of the peptides has a high helical content induced upon incubation with negatively charged membranes, but only the V681-non-dis wild type peptide, having an intact nonpolar helix face (Fig. 1), has a high helix content induced upon interaction with membranes composed of neutral lipids. The V681-dis peptide has slightly reduced helical content when bound to negatively charged membranes (68%) compared with the wild type V681-non-dis (81%) indicating that helical conformations are somewhat disrupted upon binding at the membrane interface. However, because 81% helix corresponds to around 21 amino acid residues in V681 and 68% corresponds to 17–18 amino acid residues, the V13K mutation does not result in large scale unfolding of helical conformations to release the Lys-13 residue from the nonpolar helix face.Membrane BindingTrp Fluorescence—The sample restrictions in CD spectroscopy require that conformational analyses that relate to membrane binding can only be done under conditions of very high lipid and peptide concentrations. In addition, the possibility that the absence or limited amount of helical conformations in the presence of lipid vesicles results from binding without structure formation cannot be formally ruled out from CD data alone. We therefore performed two separate series of experiments to assess peptide binding directly, and under conditions that more closely match the peptide concentrations used in antimicrobial assays. These experiments allow an assessment of relative membrane binding affinities of the peptides, and additionally can establish whether binding is cooperative or exhibits “hyperbolic” behavior. These are each of interest with respect to the mechanisms of the membrane properties of the peptides. Because RTA3 does not contain a Trp residue, we used F4W “mutants” to assess binding to phospholipid vesicles based on binding-induced perturbation of Trp fluorescence.The sequestering of the Trp indole group in an environment of reduced polarity upon membrane binding results in a blue shift in the fluorescence excitation maximum, as illustrated by the emission spectrum of the Trp-2 residue of V681-dis when titrated with increasing concentrations of lipid in the form of vesicles composed of 50% PC:PG (Fig. 4A). Titrating the same peptide with neutral lipid vesicles (100% PC) results in very small lipid-dependent blue shifts (Fig. 4B). Fig. 5 illustrates the lipid concentration-dependent fluorescence blue shifts of each of the tryptophan-containing peptides. Very similar behavior was observed for the RTA3 (Fig. 5A) and V681 (Fig. 5B) series of peptides. In each case disruption of the nonpolar helix face (with an Arg (WRTA3-dis) or Lys (V681-dis)) had only a minor effect on peptide binding to negatively charged vesicles, whereas binding to neutral vesicles was greatly suppressed. An intact nonpolar helix face (WRTA3-non-dis, V681-non-dis) resulted in strong binding to neutral lipid vesicl"
https://openalex.org/W1996670568,"The term “theory of mind” (ToM) describes an evolved psychological mechanism that is necessary to represent intentions and expectations in social interaction. It is thus involved in determining the proclivity of others to cooperate or defect. While in cooperative settings between two parties the intentions and expectations of the protagonists match, they diverge in deceptive scenarios, in which one protagonist is intentionally manipulated to hold a false belief about the intention of the other. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm using cartoons showing social interactions (including the outcome of the interaction) between two or three story characters, respectively, we sought to determine those brain areas of the ToM network involved in reasoning about cooperative versus deceptive interactions. Healthy volunteers were asked to reflect upon the protagonists' intentions and expectations in cartoons depicting cooperation, deception or a combination of both, where two characters cooperated to deceive a third. Reasoning about the mental states of the story characters yielded substantial differences in activation patterns: both deception and cooperation activated bilateral temporoparietal junction, parietal and cingulate regions, while deception alone additionally recruited orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal regions. These results indicate an important role for prefrontal cortex in processing a mismatch between a character's intention and another's expectations as required in complex social interactions."

Mycobacteria are classified as Gram-positive bacteria but have evolved a complex cell wall, comprising a peptidoglycan-arabinogalactan polymer with covalently bound mycolic acids of considerable length (up to 90 carbon atoms) and a large variety of extractable lipids (1Barry III, C.E. Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A. Yuan Y. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 2Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of these lipids are constituents of the cell envelope that provides an extraordinarily efficient permeability barrier and is an essential part of the intrinsic resistance of mycobacteria to many toxic compounds and antibiotics (3Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). To account for these observations, Minnikin (4Minnikin D.E. Ratledge C. Stanford J The Biology of the Mycobacteria: Physiology, Identification and Classification. Academic Press, London1982: 95-184Google Scholar) proposed a model in which the mycolic acids form the inner leaflet of an asymmetrical bilayer. Mutants and treatments affecting mycolic acid biosynthesis and the production of extractable lipids showed an increase in cell wall permeability and a drastic decrease in virulence, underlining the importance of the cell wall integrity for intracellular survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (1Barry III, C.E.

Cryoelectron tomography revealed the native organization of the Mycobacterium smegmatis cell envelope. Further, the three-dimensional data and the investigation of ultrathin frozen-hydrated cryosections of M. smegmatis, M. bovis BCG, and Corynebacterium glutamicum identified the outermost layer as a lipid bilayer. Mycolic acids were shown to be essential components of this bilayer, therefore providing the first visualization of mycobacterial outer membranes in their native state (5Hoffmann C. Leis A.

These findings raise the question of how the mycobacterial outer membrane is functionalized for nutrient uptake, signal transduction, and secretion of material to the cell surface and the extracellular medium. To perform these functions, Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli use more than 60 outer membrane proteins (6Molloy M.P. Herbert B.R. Slade M.B. Rabilloud T. Nouwens A.S. Williams K.L.

The channel-forming protein MspA is located in the outer membrane of M. smegmatis (7Stahl C. Kubetzko S. Kaps I. Seeber S. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40 (Correction (2005) Mol. Microbiol. 457, 1509): 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and functions as a classical porin by enabling diffusion of small and hydrophilic solutes (8Niederweis M. Ehrt S. Heinz C. Klöcker U. Karosi S. Swiderek K.M. Riley L.W. Benz R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 933-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 9Stephan J. Bender J. Wolschendorf F. Hoffmann C. Roth E. Mailänder C. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 714-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Wolschendorf F. Mahfoud M. Niederweis M. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). MspA is an octamer that forms one central channel of 10-nm length (11Faller M. Niederweis M. Schulz G.E. Science. 2004; 303: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). By contrast, porins of Gram-negative bacteria are trimeric proteins of 4.5-nm length. Each monomer forms one channel (12Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). These comparisons provided the proof of principle that mycobacterial outer membrane proteins have structures different from their functional analogs in Gram-negative bacteria. Both M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG produce channel-forming proteins that were assumed to be outer membrane proteins (13Senaratne R.H. Mobasheri H. Papavinasasundaram K.G. Jenner P. Lea E.J. Draper P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3541-3547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kartmann B. Stenger S. Niederweis M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181 (Correction (1999) J. Bacteriol. 6181, 7650): 6543-6546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lichtinger T. Heym B. Maier E. Eichner H. Cole S.T. Benz R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recombinant OmpA of M. tuberculosis was purified from E. coli and showed channel activity in lipid bilayer experiments (13Senaratne R.H. Mobasheri H. Papavinasasundaram K.G. Jenner P. Lea E.J. Draper P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3541-3547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that OmpA from M. bovis BCG has channel activity similar to the protein produced in E. coli and that a central domain of ∼150 amino acids is sufficient for channel formation (16Molle V. Saint N. Campagna S. Kremer L. Lea E. Draper P. Molle G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 826-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, channel-forming proteins of M. tuberculosis other than OmpA are not known, despite their perceived importance for the physiology and pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis. Because subcellular fractionation experiments often lead to mixing of inner and outer membrane proteins (17Rezwan M. Laneelle M.A. Sander P. Daffe M. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2007; 68: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we have used a bioinformatic approach as an alternative to predict outer membrane proteins of M. tuberculosis (18Song H. Wang Y. Sandie R. Andrade-Navarro M. Niederweis M. Tuberculosis. 2008; 10.1016/j.tube.2008.02.004PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we present conclusive evidence that one of the these proteins, Rv1698, is a protein that forms water-filled channels in lipid membranes. Expression of rv1698 in M. smegmatis increased both uptake rates for nutrients and the susceptibility to small antibiotics. Protease digestion showed that Rv1698 is surface-accessible. All of the mycolic acid-containing bacteria have a single homolog of unknown function. Thus, Rv1698 represents the first member of a new class of proteins specific for the unusual outer membranes of Corynebacterineae. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—All of the bacterial strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. Mycobacterial strains were grown at 37 °C in Middlebrook 7H9 liquid medium (Difco Laboratories) supplemented with 0.2% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 80 or on Middlebrook 7H10 agar (Difco Laboratories) supplemented with 0.2% glycerol unless indicated otherwise. E. coli DH5α was used for all cloning experiments and was routinely grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C. The following antibiotics were used when required at the following concentrations: ampicillin (100 μg ml–1 for E. coli), kanamycin (30 μgml–1 for E. coli; 30 μgml–1 for M. smegmatis), and hygromycin (200 μgml–1 for E. coli, 50 μg ml–1 for M. smegmatis). Antibiotic Sensitivity Assay—M. smegmatis strains were grown in a 4-ml culture for 2 days at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6–0.8. The cultures were diluted in Middlebrook 7H9 medium to yield ∼5,000 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. 3The abbreviations used are: cfu, colony-forming unit(s); DPhPC, diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine; OPOE, n-octylpolyethylene oxide; PIPES, piperazine-1,4-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; nS, nanosiemans. Approximately 500 cfu were streaked out on plates containing the appropriate antibiotic concentrations. As a reference 500 cfu were also plated onto plates without any antibiotic. The number of surviving cells was normalized to the number of cells counted on plates without antibiotic for each strain and expressed as relative colony forming units (% cfu). Colony counts were carried out after 3 days of incubation at 37 °C. The concentrations of the antibiotics were: ampicillin, 32 μg/ml; cephaloridin, 3 μg/ml; and chloramphenicol, 6 μg/ml. Outer Membrane Permeability for Glucose—The experiments were carried out as previously described (7Stahl C. Kubetzko S. Kaps I. Seeber S. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40 (Correction (2005) Mol. Microbiol. 457, 1509): 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To reduce aggregation and clumping, M. smegmatis strains were grown first in 4-ml cultures for 2 days at 37 °C and then filtered through a 5-μm pore size filter (Sartorius). The filtrates were grown for 2 days at 37 °C and then used to inoculate 100-ml cultures that were grown to an A600 of 0.5. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (4 °C, 3000 rpm, 10 min), washed once in 2 mm PIPES, pH 6.5, 0.05 mm MgCl2, and resuspended in the same buffer. The 14C-labeled compounds and their nonlabeled analogs were mixed and added to the cell suspensions to obtain a final concentration of 20 μm with 106 cpm. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and 1 ml-samples were removed at the indicated times. The cells were filtered through a 0.45-μm pore size filter (Sartorius) and washed with 0.1 m LiCl, and their radioactivity was determined using a liquid scintillation counter. The mean dry weight of the cells in these samples was 1.4 ± 0.4 mg. The uptake rate was expressed as nmol/mg cells. Construction of Overexpression Vectors for rv1698 for Mycobacteria and E. coli—The gene rv1698 of M. tuberculosis and its homologous gene msmeg_3747 of M. smegmatis were amplified by PCR using chromosomal DNA and the oligonucleotide pairs 1698fwd/1698rev and mpoS_SDopt_1/mspTSDrev (supplemental Table S1) introducing the restriction sites PacI and SwaI. The genes were cloned into pMN016 under the control of the psmyc promoter by using those restriction sites (9Stephan J. Bender J. Wolschendorf F. Hoffmann C. Roth E. Mailänder C. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 714-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) to give the expression vectors pMN035 and pMN451, respectively (supplemental Table S1). To purify Rv1698 from mycobacteria, the protein was C-terminally tagged with six histidine residues by PCR using the primer 1698fwd and the 5′-phosphorylated primer mpoTHis (supplemental Table S1). The resulting PCR product was digested with PacI and cloned into the backbone of pMN016 digested with PacI and SwaI to give pML911. To overexpress and analyze the pore forming activity of recombinant Rv1698, the truncated gene lacking the putative signal sequence of 30 amino acids was fused to a C-terminal His tag by cloning it into the vector pET28+ (Novagen). The gene without its putative leader sequence was amplified from pMN035 by using the oligonucleotides pMS-Seq1 and his_rv1698fwd (supplemental Table S1). Both, the PCR fragment and pET28b+ were digested with restriction endonucleases NdeI and HindIII and ligated to give pML122 (supplemental Table S1). A vector for expression of untagged Rv1698 without the predicted signal peptide in E. coli was constructed using the oligonucleotides mat-rv1698fwd and mat-rvrev introducing the two restriction sites NcoI and NdeI (supplemental Table S1). The digested fragment was cloned into the vector pET-16b, which was treated with the same restriction endonucleases to obtain pML141. Overexpression, Purification, and Renaturation of Recombinant Rv1698His from E. coli—Cultures of E. coli Rosetta carrying the overexpression vectors pML122 were grown at 37 °C. When the culture reached an A600 of 1, isopropylthio-β-d-galactosidase was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm to induce gene expression. After a further 4 h of incubation, the bacteria were harvested and resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100). The cell suspension was sonicated four times for 20 s with 12 watts in 30-s intervals. 0.01 mg/ml DNase and 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme were added and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The broken cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer followed by sonication as described above. This step was repeated twice. Then the broken cells were resuspended in washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl) and sonicated again. Because rRv1698His formed inclusion bodies, the proteins in the pellet were dissolved with 8 m urea, separated from cell debris by centrifugation, and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid spin kit; Qiagen). The bound proteins were washed and eluted from the column by using a four-step pH gradient with TPU buffer (6 m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris) at different pH levels (pH 6.3/5.9/4.8/4.5) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The protein fraction at pH 4.5 contained most of the rRv1698His protein. Purified rRv1698His (180 μg/ml) was diluted 100-fold in 25 mm sodium-phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.5% n-octylpolyethylene oxide (OPOE) at room temperature to remove urea and renature the protein. The resulting protein was directly used in black lipid bilayer experiments to determine single channel conductance and ion selectivity of the pore as described below. The BCA kit (Pierce) was used routinely to determine protein concentrations. Purification of Rv1698His from M. bovis BCG—M. bovis BCG carrying the plasmid pML911 was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 liquid medium supplemented with 10% oleic acid albumin dextrose complex, 0.05% Tween 80, and hygromycin. At an A600 of 1, the bacteria were harvested, incubated in a rotatory shaker (200 rpm) with lysozyme 1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) for 2 h at 37°C and disrupted at 4 °C using a Sonicator 3000 ultrasonic liquid processor (Misonix) in 2 steps of 30 min (micro tip, pulsar cycle of 1 s, 9 W delivered per cycle). The proteins were solubilized by incubation with 1% SDS in PBS for 18 h (37 °C, 200 rpm). Nonsoluble material was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 4 °C) before purifying Rv1698His on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) using a batch procedure. The bound His-tagged protein was washed and eluted from the resin by using a three-step imidazole gradient (5/20/250 mm) in sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.6, 0.3 m NaCl) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The His-tagged protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole. Because of the high imidazole concentration, the BCA assay was not used, and the purified Rv1698His protein was quantified by using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In addition, a calibration curve of band intensities was established with known amounts of bovine serum albumin in Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels using image analysis software (LabWorks 4.6, UVP). Then the amount of Rv1698 was determined relative to the bovine serum albumin reference. Both methods yielded the similar values. Lipid Bilayer Experiments—The single channel conductance of Rv1698 protein was analyzed on a custom-made lipid bilayer apparatus as described previously (19Heinz C. Niederweis M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Ag/AgCl electrodes were bathed in a solution of 1 m KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. The lipid membranes were painted from a solution of 1% diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine (DPhPC; Avanti Polar Lipids) in n-decane. Before adding the protein, current traces of at least three or more membranes were recorded with the appropriate detergent (0.5% OPOE or 0.1% SDS in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5) to exclude any contamination with channel forming activity and to demonstrate that the detergents did not affect the membrane. Then protein was added to both sides of the cuvette. Single channel conductances for more than 100 pores/sample were digitally recorded. The raw data were analyzed using IGOR Pro 5.03 program (WaveMetrics) and a macro provided by Dr. Harald Engelhardt. These data were further analyzed in SigmaPlot 9.0 (Systat Software) to generate the figures shown here. The ion selectivity of Rv1698His was measured exactly as described previously (8Niederweis M. Ehrt S. Heinz C. Klöcker U. Karosi S. Swiderek K.M. Riley L.W. Benz R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 933-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Preparation of RNA from M. tuberculosis and RT-PCR Experiments—Total RNA of M. tuberculosis H37Rv was isolated by the TRIzol method as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, the cultures were grown in 100 ml of 7H9 medium supplemented with 10% oleic acid albumin dextrose complex and 0.05% Tween 80 to log phase. Thirty five ml of the GTC buffer (5 m guanidium thiocyanate, 0.5% sarcosyl, 0.5% Tween 80, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) was added, and the culture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 1.5 ml of TRIzol and lysed by agitation with glass beads (FastRNA Tubes-Blue) in a FastPrep© FP120 bead beater apparatus (Bio-101) for 3 × 45 s at level 6.5. The suspensions were cooled on ice for 5 min between agitation steps. 500 μl of chloroform was added, and centrifugation was done for 5 min at 14,000 × g. The upper phase was transferred to a new tube containing an equal volume of isopropanol. The tubes were incubated for 20 min at –80 °C and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 100 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water (Ambion). Further purification of samples was performed using Nucleospin→RNAII kit (Macherey-Nagel) following the instructions of the manufacturer. RNA was sonicated to render DNA accessibility to DNase degradation (2 × 20 s at 20% power), 5 min on ice between sonications (20Stephan J. Bail J.G. Titgemeyer F. Niederweis M. BMC Microbiol. 2004; 4: 45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). 5–10 μg of sonicated DNA was used for Turbo DNase treatment, which was done according to the manufacturer protocol (Ambion). cDNA synthesis was performed using SuperScript III first strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer protocol using random primers. AccuPrime Pfx SuperMix (Invitrogen) was employed for the PCR. Primers used were RT-rv1698fwd and RT-rv1698rev (supplemental Table S1). Thirty five cycles (30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, 30 s at 68 °C) were run to amplify the cDNA. The PCR products were analyzed using 1% agarose gels, which were stained with ethidium bromide. Primers specific for 16 S rRNA were used as a positive control for RT-PCR. Protease Accessibility Assay—Experiments to examine the surface accessibility of Rv1698 were carried out as described previously (21Delogu G. Pusceddu C. Bua A. Fadda G. Brennan M.J. Zanetti S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. M. smegmatis strains carrying the plasmids pMN437, pML911, pML451, and pMV61015.1 were grown in 20 ml of Middlebrook 7H9 medium and harvested as culture reached an A600 of about 3.5. The cells were washed once with Tris-buffered saline buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl) and then resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer. Two aliquots of 150 μl were taken, and proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to one of the aliquots to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. After 30 min at 4 °C the reaction was stopped by adding Complete© EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) from a 7-fold stock solution. The samples were immediately centrifuged, washed once in 250 μl of Tris-buffered saline, and resuspended in 75 μl of Tris-buffered saline plus 25 μl of 4× protein loading buffer (160 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 12% SDS, 32% glycerol, 0.4% bromphenol blue). Finally, the samples were boiled for 20 min to allow cell lysis and centrifuged again to remove insoluble debris, and 50 μl of the protein extracts were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed in Western blots using standard protocols (22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidmann J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). The program LabWorks 4.6 (UVP) was used for quantitative image analysis to determine the amount of detected Rv1698 protein in treated and untreated samples. Analysis of Protein Secondary Structures—Secondary structures of Rv1698 and reference proteins were predicted using the JPred 3 server (23Cuff J.A. Clamp M.E. Siddiqui A.S. Finlay M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 24Cuff J.A. Barton G.J. Proteins. 1999; 34: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) and the Network Protein Sequence Analysis server. SignalP3.0 (25Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5634) Google Scholar) was accessed to examine the presence of signal peptides for Rv1698. The TMHMM2.0 program (26Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9084) Google Scholar, 27Melen K. Krogh A. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) was used for prediction of hydrophobic transmembrane α-helices. All of the algorithms were used with standard settings unless otherwise noted. The hydrophobicity profile of Rv1698 was calculated using an algorithm that was developed to detect repetitive oscillations of the hydropathy profile (28Rauch G. Moran O. Comput. Methods Programs Biomed. 1995; 48: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and the Eisenberg hydrophobicity scale of amino acids (29Eisenberg D. Wilcox W. McLachlan A.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1986; 31: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Estimation of the Minimal Size of the Rv1698 Pore—The two-dimensional structures of ampicillin (Compound ID 2174), chloramphenicol (Compound ID 5959), and glucose (Compound ID 5793) were downloaded from PubChemCompound data base at NCBI. The Chem3D Pro 8.0 software (Cambridge-Soft) was used to obtain three-dimensional structures of these molecules and to minimize their energy using the MOPAC algorithm. Using the program Chimera (30Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (27946) Google Scholar), the molecules were oriented along their longest axis, and the length of the second longest axis was measured between the nuclei of the most distant atoms along this axis. These values were taken as the widths of the molecules and used for a minimal estimate of the pore size of Rv1698. The Rv1698 Protein Increases the Susceptibility of an M. smegmatis Porin Mutant to Hydrophilic Antibiotics—A genome-wide secondary structure prediction of all exported proteins identified Rv1698 as a putative outer membrane protein of M. tuberculosis (18Song H. Wang Y. Sandie R. Andrade-Navarro M. Niederweis M. Tuberculosis. 2008; 10.1016/j.tube.2008.02.004PubMed Google Scholar). The genomes of all mycobacteria including M. smegmatis (Msmeg_3747) and Mycobacterium leprae (ML1362) and other closely related bacteria such as Nocardia and Corynebacteria encode a single homolog of Rv1698 (supplemental Fig. S1). This indicated that Rv1698 and its homologs might perform a function specific for the mycolic acid-containing outer membrane of these bacteria. To examine whether this protein might be a porin, we used the strain M. smegmatis MN01, which lacks the major porin gene mspA. The outer membrane permeability of the ΔmspA mutant to hydrophilic β-lactam antibiotics was decreased 9-fold (7Stahl C. Kubetzko S. Kaps I. Seeber S. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40 (Correction (2005) Mol. Microbiol. 457, 1509): 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This resulted in a 16-fold increased resistance toward ampicillin compared with wild-type M. smegmatis (31Stephan J. Mailaender C. Etienne G. Daffe M. Niederweis M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4163-4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Constitutive expression of mspA restored the susceptibility of the ΔmspA mutant MN01 to ampicillin and cephaloridine to wild-type levels as determined by using an agar dilution assay (Fig. 1). The susceptibility of the ΔmspA mutant to these antibiotics was also significantly increased by expression of the rv1698 gene. To exclude that this was an antibiotic-specific effect, we examined whether rv1698 had a similar effect on the efficacy of chloramphenicol against M. smegmatis. Indeed, expression of both mspA and rv1698 significantly increased the susceptibility of the ΔmspA mutant MN01 to chloramphenicol. These results indicated that Rv1698 increased the outer membrane permeability of the M. smegmatis ΔmspA mutant. Rv1698 Partially Complements the Permeability Defect of Porin Mutants of M. smegmatis—It was shown previously that porin-mediated permeation through the outer membrane is the rate-limiting step for uptake of glucose by M. smegmatis (7Stahl C. Kubetzko S. Kaps I. Seeber S. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40 (Correction (2005) Mol. Microbiol. 457, 1509): 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 9Stephan J. Bender J. Wolschendorf F. Hoffmann C. Roth E. Mailänder C. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 714-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For example, the minimal permeability coefficient of the ΔmspA ΔmspC mutant ML10 for glucose is 50-fold lower than that of wild-type M. smegmatis (9Stephan J. Bender J. Wolschendorf F. Hoffmann C. Roth E. Mailänder C. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 714-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to examine whether rv1698 could complement the slow uptake of glucose by the porin double mutant ML10. Glucose at a concentration of 20 μm was taken up by the ML10 strain carrying the empty vector pMS2 with an average rate of 42 pmol/min/mg cells. This rate was increased 5-fold to 224 pmol/min/mg cells in the presence of the rv1698 expression vector pMN035 (supplemental Table S1), demonstrating that Rv1698 indeed increased the outer membrane permeability of the porin double mutant ML10 (Fig. 2). However, expression of rv1698 only partially restored the permeability defect of the porin mutant M. smegmatis ML10 in con"
https://openalex.org/W2077098814,"Background S-PM2 is a phage capable of infecting strains of unicellular cyanobacteria belonging to the genus Synechococcus. S-PM2, like other myoviruses infecting marine cyanobacteria, encodes a number of bacterial-like genes. Amongst these genes is one encoding a MazG homologue that is hypothesized to be involved in the adaption of the infected host for production of progeny phage. Methodology/Principal Findings This study focuses on establishing the occurrence of mazG homologues in other cyanophages isolated from different oceanic locations. Degenerate PCR primers were designed using the mazG gene of S-PM2. The mazG gene was found to be widely distributed and highly conserved among Synechococcus myoviruses and podoviruses from diverse oceanic provinces. Conclusions/Significance This study provides evidence of a globally connected cyanophage gene pool, the cyanophage mazG gene having a small effective population size indicative of rapid lateral gene transfer despite being present in a substantial fraction of cyanophage. The Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus phage mazG genes do not cluster with the host mazG gene, suggesting that their primary hosts are not the source of the mazG gene."
https://openalex.org/W2038107183,"Background Though recent advancement in proteomics has provided a novel perspective on several distinct pathogenetic mechanisms leading to preterm birth (inflammation, bleeding), the etiology of most preterm births still remains elusive. We conducted a multidimensional proteomic analysis of the amniotic fluid to identify pathways related to preterm birth in the absence of inflammation or bleeding. Methodology/Principal Findings A proteomic fingerprint was generated from fresh amniotic fluid using surface-enhanced laser desorbtion ionization time of flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry in a total of 286 consecutive samples retrieved from women who presented with signs or symptoms of preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of the membranes. Inflammation and/or bleeding proteomic patterns were detected in 32% (92/286) of the SELDI tracings. In the remaining tracings, a hierarchical algorithm was applied based on descriptors quantifying similarity/dissimilarity among proteomic fingerprints. This allowed identification of a novel profile (Q-profile) based on the presence of 5 SELDI peaks in the 10–12.5 kDa mass area. Women displaying the Q-profile (mean±SD, gestational age: 25±4 weeks, n = 40) were more likely to deliver preterm despite expectant management in the context of intact membranes and normal amniotic fluid clinical results. Utilizing identification-centered proteomics techniques (fluorescence two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis, robotic tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry) coupled with Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER) ontological classifications, we determined that in amniotic fluids with Q-profile the differentially expressed proteins are primarily involved in non-inflammatory biological processes such as protein metabolism, signal transduction and transport. Conclusion/Significance Proteomic profiling of amniotic fluid coupled with non-hierarchical bioinformatics algorithms identified a subgroup of patients at risk for preterm birth in the absence of intra-amniotic inflammation or bleeding, suggesting a novel pathogenetic pathway leading to preterm birth. The altered proteins may offer opportunities for therapeutical intervention and future drug development to prevent prematurity."
https://openalex.org/W2015775274,"The seven antigenically distinct serotypes of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins cleave specific soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor complex proteins and block the release of neurotransmitters that cause flaccid paralysis and are considered potential bioweapons. Botulinum neurotoxin type A is the most potent among the clostridial neurotoxins, and to date there is no post-exposure therapeutic intervention available. To develop inhibitors leading to drug design, it is imperative that critical interactions between the enzyme and the substrate near the active site are known. Although enzyme-substrate interactions at exosites away from the active site are mapped in detail for botulinum neurotoxin type A, information about the active site interactions is lacking. Here, we present the crystal structures of botulinum neurotoxin type A catalytic domain in complex with four inhibitory substrate analog tetrapeptides, viz. RRGC, RRGL, RRGI, and RRGM at resolutions of 1.6–1.8Å. These structures show for the first time the interactions between the substrate and enzyme at the active site and delineate residues important for substrate stabilization and catalytic activity. We show that OH of Tyr366 and NH2 of Arg363 are hydrogen-bonded to carbonyl oxygens of P1 and P1′ of the substrate analog and position it for catalytic activity. Most importantly, the nucleophilic water is replaced by the amino group of the N-terminal residue of the tetrapeptide. Furthermore, the S1′ site is formed by Phe194, Thr215, Thr220, Asp370, and Arg363. The Ki of the best inhibitory tetrapeptide is 157 nm.

Botulinum (BoNT) 2The abbreviations used are: BoNT, botulinum neurotoxin; CNT, Clostridium neurotoxin. and tetanus neurotoxins are causative agents of botulism and tetanus, serious neurological disorders. Their LD50 values in humans are in the range of 0.1–1 ng/kg (1Schiavo G. Rossetto O. Benfenati F. Poulain B. Montecucco C. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

They are listed as Category A bioterror agents by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of the seven serotypes (A to G) produced by Clostridium botulinum, BoNT/A, BoNT/B, and BoNT/E (and possibly BoNT/C and BoNT/F) have been implicated in cases of botulism in humans, with BoNT/A being the most potent of them. Clostridium neurotoxins (CNT) are synthesized as single inactive polypeptide chains (150 kDa) and released as active dichains (heavy, 100 kDa; light, 50 kDa) held together by an interchain disulfide bond after cleavage by proteinases (3DasGupta B.R.

BoNTs act via a four-step process involving (i) cell binding, (ii) internalization, (iii) translocation into the cytosol, and (iv) enzymatic modification of a cytosolic target (7Montecucco C.

BoNTs block the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, causing flaccid paralysis, whereas tetanus blocks the release of neurotransmitters such as glycine and γ-aminobutyric acid in inhibitory interneurons of the spinal cord, resulting in spastic paralysis. Despite different clinical symptoms, these etiological agents intoxicate neuronal cells in the same way and have similar functional and structural organizations (12Lacy D.B. Tepp W. Cohen A.C.

The light chain is the catalytic domain and acts as a zinc endopeptidase on specific components of the neuroexocytosis apparatus in the cytosol of the target cell. BoNT/A and BoNT/E cleave SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associated protein- 25 kDa), whereas BoNT/B, BoNT/D, BoNT/F, and BoNT/G cleave the vesicle-associated membrane protein at specific peptide bonds. BoNT/C is unique because it is the only CNT capable of cleaving two substrates, SNAP-25 and syntaxin (16Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 717-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). Because they are Category A bioterror agents, it is imperative that countermeasures are developed to block their toxicity by targeting any one of the four steps in their mechanism of action. Here, we present the design and structural basis of inhibitors to block the catalytic activity of the BoNT/A serotype. Although it is desirable to have a full-length BoNT/A light chain structure for inhibitor studies, we cloned the BoNT/A light chain (residues 1–424) (hereafter called Balc424), which is as active as the wild type because the full-length light chain was not amenable to crystallization (17Silvaggi N.R. Boldt G.E. Hixon M.S. Kennedy J.P. Tzipori S. Janda K.D. Allen K.N. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 533-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cloning—The DNA encoding light chain 1–424 was PCR-amplified using the forward primer 5′-ATGACCATGGGCATGCCATTTGTTAATAAAC-3′, which adds an NcoI restriction site to the 5′-end, and the reverse primer 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTCAAACAATCCAG-3′, bearing a XhoI restriction site, to the 3′-end. The restriction sites are in bold and underlined. The PCR product was subcloned into the pET28b(+) vector (Novagen) using the NcoI and XhoI restriction sites. The BoNT/A full-length light chain plasmid, a kind gift from Thomas Binz, was used as the template for PCR. Expression and Purification—The plasmid encoding Balc424 was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene). Cells were inoculated into ZYP-5052 medium containing antibiotics and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of about 0.6. The cells were then allowed to auto-induce overnight at 18 °C (18Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4140) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, and the C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged protein was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) by standard techniques. Fractions containing Balc424 protein were concentrated and loaded onto a size exclusion (S-200) column previously equilibrated with 2 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm NaCl, and 20 mm HEPES buffer at pH 7.4. The purified protein was then stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration was determined from ϵ280 = 45.4 m-1cm-1. Crystallization and Data Collection—Balc424 crystals were grown using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. Equal volumes (2 μl) of protein (20 mg/ml) and reservoir solutions were mixed and equilibrated against 800 μl of reservoir solution containing 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.3 m ammonium sulfate, and 100 mm Bis-Tris buffer at pH 6.8. Plate-like crystals obtained in a week were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen after transferring to the mother liquor containing 15% ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant. X-ray data were collected at beamline X29 of the National Synchrotron Light Source using a wavelength of 0.979 Å. Balc424 crystals diffract to at least 1.7-Å resolution. Data were indexed, processed, and scaled using HKL2000 (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar) (shown in Table 1). Assuming one molecule of 50 kDa per asymmetric unit, the Matthews coefficient is 2.2 Å3/Da corresponding to an estimated solvent content of 43% by volume of the unit cell.TABLE 1Crystal data and refinement statistics of Balc424 and its complexesBalc424RRGCRRGMRRGLRRGICrystal data Cell dimensions a (Å)50.7750.8850.7450.7250.62 b (Å)66.3066.3966.3766.3766.40 c (Å)64.9164.7564.9664.8464.95 β98.2°98.3°98.4°98.3°98.5° Space groupP21P21P21P21P21 Resolution (Å)aValues indicate resolution with 75% completion in the last shell1.831.71.741.61.62 Resolution range used (Å)bFor refinement, all observed reflections were included Overall50-1.750-1.650-1.5850-1.5250-1.47 Last shell1.76-1.71.65-1.61.63-1.581.56-1.521.51-1.47 No. unique reflections40,33251,49150,59060,31263,031 Completeness (overall/last shell) (%)86.1/5091.4/6386.2/4891.6/6087.0/52 Rmerge (overall/last shell)cRmerge = Σi(|Ih – 〈I〉h|)/ΣIh, where 〈I〉h is the average intensity over symmetry equivalents4.7/153.9/12.75.6/22.46.6/17.16.6/19.4〈I/σ(I)〉 overall/last shell20.2/2.528.4/3.021.3/2.021.5/2.520.0/2.0Refinement statistics Resolution (Å)50-1.750-1.650-1.5850-1.5250-1.47 R-factor/Rfree (%)dR-factor = Σ|Fo – Fc|/Σ|Fo|20.6/24.119.8/21.719.6/21.019.1/20.820.3/21.4 r.m.s.d.er.m.s.d., root mean square deviation from ideality Bond length (Å)0.0060.0050.0050.0050.005 Bond angle1.17°1.19°1.17°1.2°1.18° Average B-factors (Å2) Main chain29.421.121.718.621.9 Side chain31.423.723.620.723.7 Waters33.026.128.026.727.8 Ions41.635.737.535.737.7 Ligand/peptide2626.426.120.422.0 No. atoms Proteins34233415341534153423 Waters247344366389372 Ions ( Zn2+/SO42−)1/101/101/151/151/15 Ligands4 (acetate)33353535 Surface area (total/buried; Å2)785/560841/611825/582813/591 Residues (%) in the core region of ϕ-ψ plot89.789.488.790.288.7a Values indicate resolution with 75% completion in the last shellb For refinement, all observed reflections were includedc Rmerge = Σi(|Ih – 〈I〉h|)/ΣIh, where 〈I〉h is the average intensity over symmetry equivalentsd R-factor = Σ|Fo – Fc|/Σ|Fo|e r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The crystal structure was determined by molecular replacement with MOLREP in the CCP4 program suite (20Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain (residues 10–420) of the full holotoxin type A (Protein Data Bank entry 3BTA) was used as a search model after removing flexible loops. Rigid-body refinements of initial solution followed by simulated annealing with CNS gave an excellent electron density map (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Residues not included in the search model were built using program O, and the model was further refined (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The final R and Rfree are 20.6 and 24.1%, respectively. The final model contains residues 1–423, two sulfate ions, and 230 waters. In addition to these, the model contains an acetate ion that coordinates to zinc in a bidentate fashion. Residue 424 and the C-terminal His tag were not modeled because of weak or missing electron density. Balc424-Tetrapetide Complexes—Balc424 was cocrystallized individually with tetrapeptides (RRGC, RRGM, RRGL, and RRGI amides) by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature using conditions similar to native protein. Balc424 was mixed with a >10-fold molar excess of the tetrapeptide for cocrystallization trials. Balc424 gave better complex crystals with RRGC, RRGM, RRGL, and RRGI at stoichiometric ratios of 1:30, 1:30, 1:40, and 1:40, respectively. Structures of the complexes were determined by rigid-body refinement of the Balc424 model followed by stimulated annealing. Both the composite omit map and the difference Fourier map showed interpretable electron density for all the tetrapeptides. In RRGC, the residual density near the S-γ atom of P3′ Cys was modeled as a sodium ion. Initial attempts to model this residual density as a water molecule or sulfenic acid of P3′ Cys were unsuccessful. Residual densities elsewhere were modeled as sulfate ions in all four complexes. The respective models were refined using CNS. The data and refinement statistics are given in Table 1. To confirm the sulfur position in RRGC and RRGM complexes, redundant data were collected at a wavelength of 1.54 Å. The anomalous difference Fourier maps computed with the model phases (excluding the tetrapeptide) clearly showed the sulfur position of cysteine and methionine, thus confirming the orientation of the peptide. Structure of Wild-type Balc424—The crystal structure of Balc424 was determined by the molecular replacement method using the light chain of holotoxin (Protein Data Bank entry 3BTA) as a search model. The asymmetric unit contains one molecule of Balc424 with an acetate ion at the active site replacing the nucleophilic water (Fig. 1). The structure of Balc424 is essentially similar (root mean square deviation of ∼1.3 Å for Cα atoms) to reported structures of BoNT/A light chain except for the structural changes in the 200 and 250 loops (12Lacy D.B.

These loops pack against the 370 loop and take a helical conformation (Fig. 1A), unlike other light chain structures where they are disordered. The electron density for these loops is well defined, showing ordered secondary structures, implying that this might be the most stable arrangement for this region. This may also be due to the allosteric effect of the acetate ion binding in the active site. The active site of CNTs is characterized by a strictly conserved HEXXH + E motif and a catalytic zinc ion. A water molecule coordinated to a zinc ion and hydrogen-bonded to the conserved glutamate of the HEXXH motif acts as a nucleophile for the proteolytic reaction. In the current structure, zinc takes hexa-coordination from nitrogen atoms of His223 and His227, carboxylate oxygens of Glu262, and an acetate ion in a bidentate fashion (Fig. 1B). Oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group of an acetate ion are hydrogen-bonded to Glu224 and the hydroxyl group of Tyr366, with one of them replacing the nucleophilic water. In the BoNT/B structure, the nucleophilic water is replaced by a sulfate ion, and such a replacement has been commonly observed in other enzymes (14Swaminathan S. Eswaramoorthy S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 24Burnett J.C. Ruthel G. Stegmann C.M. Panchal R.G. Nguyen T.L. Hermone A.R. Stafford R.G. Lane D.J. Kenny T.A. McGrath C.F. Wipf P.

Mutating Glu224 to Gln or Ala abolishes the catalytic activity completely, whereas mutating Tyr366 to Phe or Ala reduces the activity in BoNT/A and BoNT/E (28Agarwal R. Binz T. Swaminathan S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8291-8302Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Agarwal R. Eswaramoorthy S. Kumaran D. Binz T. Swaminathan S.

Accordingly, Glu224 is essential and acts as a general base for the activation, whereas Tyr366 is required for stabilizing the transition state intermediate. Glu351 is hydrogen-bonded to His223 and also forms a salt bridge with Arg363. These interactions are essential to keep the active site geometry intact and maintain the charge distribution that is critical for substrate binding and catalysis. They are also observed in other serotypes, suggesting that all BoNTs follow similar catalytic mechanism. This is the first crystal structure of BoNT/A catalytic domain with one molecule per asymmetric unit and with the active site exposed to a solvent region unobstructed by crystal packing, making this crystal form ideal for inhibitor complex studies. Substrate Binding and Catalysis—CNTs hydrolyze specific peptide bonds in the neuronal soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor proteins (32Schiavo G. Benfenati F. Poulain B. Rossetto O. Polverino de Laureto P. DasGupta B.R. Montecucco C. Nature. 1992; 359: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). For example, BoNT/A cleaves the peptide bond Gln197–Arg198 of SNAP-25. It is known that CNTs recognize the substrate at remote regions away from the active site called exosites to undergo efficient hydrolysis (33Cornille F. Martin L. Lenoir C. Cussac D. Roques B.P.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the complex between the double mutant (Y366F/E224Q) of Balc and the SNAP-25-(146–204)-peptide has provided information about exosites, substrate recognition, and the substrate-binding mode (23Breidenbach M.A. Brunger A.T. Nature. 2004; 432: 925-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, the critical interactions between the enzyme and the substrate at the proteolytic site are missing, probably due to the introduced mutation. To fill this information gap and understand the interactions between the substrate and BoNT/A at the active site, we determined the high-resolution crystal structures of Balc424 in complex with inhibitory tetrapeptides (partly mimicking the substrate), RRGX, where X = C, M, L, or I. These peptides are designed to mimic the substrate scissile bond (P1 and P1′) and are designed for optimal binding (P2′ and P3′) as well as inhibition. Balc424 was cocrystallized with tetrapeptides RRGC, RRGM, RRGL, and RRGI (all containing a C-terminal amide group) and are hereafter referred to as such to represent the complexes (Table 1). The native Balc424 structure was used as the starting model with data collected from crystals of complexes. Models of tetrapeptides were fitted unambiguously in the difference Fourier maps calculated after rigid-body refinement followed by simulated annealing refinement with CNS (Fig. 2). The orientation of the tetrapeptide was verified and confirmed by the anomalous signal from sulfur (Cys/Met). Crystal structures of the Balc424-tetrapeptide complex provide substantial information about the substrate-binding mode and its essential and critical interactions for proteolysis at the active site. Overall, the structure and active site of Balc424 in all four tetrapeptide complexes are similar to the acetate ion-bound native structure (root mean square deviation of ∼1.0 Å for 400 common Cα atom pairs). Also, the overall binding mode, orientations, and molecular interactions of all four tetrapeptides with the enzyme are similar except for the side chain conformation of the second arginine (Fig. 3A). The tetrapeptides are tightly bound to the protein (average B-factor and buried surface area for the peptides, Table 1) and mostly interact with the 200, 250, and 370 loops. In all four structures, the nitrogen atom of the N-terminal amino group of the tetrapeptide replaces the nucleophilic water, coordinates with zinc, and forms hydrogen bonds with the general catalytic base, Glu224 (Fig. 3, B and C). The guanidinium group of the first arginine in the tetrapeptide forms a salt bridge with Glu164 in the S1 subsite while the side chain of the second arginine of the peptide binds in the S1′ pocket and makes a salt bridge with Asp370 (Figs. 3 and 4). In addition to the salt bridge, the guanidinium group of the second arginine stacks between the guanidinium group of Arg363 and Phe194. Mutation of Glu164 or Asp370 reduces the catalytic activity of BoNT/A, indicating that these residues are important for substrate binding and positioning of the scissile bond for nucleophilic attack and proteolysis (25Fu Z.

Gilsdorf J. Smith L.A. Protein J. 2008; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to say that the first two arginines of the tetrapeptide mimic P1 and P1′ of the substrate and accordingly are called P1 and P1′ hereafter. Significant reduction in enzymatic activity was observed when Tyr366 was mutated to Phe (30Binz T. Bade S. Rummel A. Kollewe A. Alves J.

Moreover, this carbonyl oxygen forms a coordination bond with the zinc ion, resulting in zinc having six coordinations with distorted octahedral geometry. In the Balc-SNAP-25-(146–204)-structure, the crucial interactions between the scissile bond of the P1 and P1′ residues (Gln197–Arg198) of SNAP-25 and the active site are missing, probably because of the double mutation. This is the first structural study showing critical interactions between the substrate and BoNT/A at the proteolytic site responsible for catalytic activity. Arg363 and Glu351 are conserved across all serotypes, and their role in catalytic activity has been established both by mutational and structural studies in BoNT/E and BoNT/A (28Agarwal R. Binz T. Swaminathan S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8291-8302Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Binz T. Bade S. Rummel A. Kollewe A. Alves J.

Commun. 2001; 288: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition to interactions similar to native structure, the side chain of Arg363 is hydrogen-bonded to P1′ carbonyl oxygen and helps in positioning the substrate for catalytic activity. In all four structures, the S1′ site is formed by Phe194, Thr215, Thr220, Arg363, and Asp370. Also, the C-terminal amide oxygen of the tetrapeptide makes a hydrogen bond with the backbone nitrogen of Asp370. These interactions are common in all four Balc-tetrapeptide complex structures (Fig. 4). The C-terminal side chain of the tetrapeptide is packed against the hydrophobic pocket that is composed of Pro206, Leu207, Tyr250, Tyr251, Met253, Leu256, Phe369, and Phe423 (Fig. 5). Ten water molecules in the vicinity of the active site and tetrapeptide are involved in stabilizing the complex. Enzymatic Mechanism—The present structures of enzyme-tetrapeptide complexes could represent the Michaelis complex formation, though the P1 amino group replaces the nucleophilic water (Fig. 3C). P1 carbonyl oxygen forms a coordination with a zinc ion and also hydrogen bonds with OH of Tyr366, whereas P1′ carbonyl oxygen is hydrogen-bonded to NH1 of Arg363. These two interactions position and stabilize the substrate for catalytic action. Based on our structural and available biochemical information, we are proposing the following catalytic mechanism. Glu224 acts as a general base by abstracting a proton from the nucleophilic water. The nucleophilic water attacks the carbonyl carbon of the scissile bond, which forms the tetrahedral transition state (Fig. 6). The zinc ion and Tyr366 might stabilize this intermediate tetrahedral transition state. The shuttling of protons with the help of Glu224 assists subsequent formation of a stable leaving amino group. This model is consistent with our model proposed for BoNT/B and BoNT/E and is similar to thermolysin (29Agarwal R. Eswaramoorthy S. Kumaran D. Binz T. Swaminathan S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6637-6644Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 39Swaminathan S. Eswaramoorthy S. Kumaran D.

Substrate-based Inhibitor—Developing a substrate-based peptide inhibitor is a common strategy for designing inhibitors for proteases. Recently, crystal structures of BoNT/A light chain in complex with inhibitors l-arginine hydroxamate, 4-chlorocinnamic hydroxamate, and 2,4-dichlorocinnamic hydroxamate have been reported (17Silvaggi N.R. Boldt G.E. Hixon M.S. Kennedy J.P. Tzipori S. Janda K.D. Allen K.N. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 533-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These inhibitors inhibit utmost at 300-nm levels. In this study we used substrate- and structure-based approaches to search for better inhibitors. The inhibitor was designed based on two main criteria: the charge distribution in the active site cavity and the substrate proteolytic site (42Ludivico M.L. Smith L.A. Ahmed S.A. Keller J.E. 43rd Annual Meeting of the IBRCC. Interagency Botulism Research Coordinating Committee, Silver Spring, MD2006Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows the electrostatic surface potential diagram for BoNT/A active site. It is evident that the zinc-binding region is mostly negatively charged, and the region where loops 200, 250, and 370 come together is hydrophobic. Accordingly, the inhibitor should have positively charged residues at one end and hydrophobic ones on the other to enhance the binding affinity. BoNT/A cleaves at the peptide bond between Gln197 (P1) and Arg198 (P1′) of SNAP-25. P1′ was maintained as Arg as in the substrate because it maintains the positive charge and also fits well at the S1′ site. Moreover, P1′ is critical for the substrate binding (43Schmidt J.J. Stafford R.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). P1 was changed to Arg from Gln to enhance positive charge. Based on this we designed four tetrapeptides (RRGC, RRGM, RRGL, and RRGI), all of them having hydrophobic residues of varying size at the C terminus. The Ki determined for the inhibitors with a 17-mer SNAP-25 substrate peptide using the full-length Balc was 157 nm, 660 nm, 786 nm, and 845 nm for RRGC, RRGL, RRGI, and RRGM, respectively. When the assay was done in the presence of ZnCl2 and dithiothreitol, the IC50 for RRGC significantly increased, but those of the other three were unaffected. 3M. L. Ludivico, S. Swaminathan, and S. A. Ahmed, unpublished data. The latter three or their derivatives, potentially being free from the intracellular redox environment, should thus be suitable for further studies as drug candidates. This is the first report of a high affinity, small peptide inhibitor of BoNT/A protease activity in solution and the structural study in complex with the target. Analysis of intermolecular forces between the enzyme and peptide molecule indicates that the N-terminal arginines of the tetrapeptides play a vital role in the binding of inhibitor to the enzyme. As we expected, the two N-terminal arginines of the peptide inhibitor fit in the acidic region, and the C-terminal hydrophobic residues (P3′) of all four (Cys, Met, Leu, and Ile) pack against the hydrophobic region (Figs. 3 and 5). P2′ Gly acts as a flexible linker between the two. The salt bridges formed by the N-terminal P1 Arg with Glu164 and P1′ Arg with Asp370 anchor the inhibitor for binding. The nucleophilic water has been displaced by the amino group of P1 and is not available for catalytic activity. The optimum length for a peptide inhibitor has been suggested to be a heptapeptide (14Swaminathan S. Eswaramoorthy S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 24Burnett J.C. Ruthel G. Stegmann C.M. Panchal R.G. Nguyen T.L. Hermone A.R. Stafford R.G. Lane D.J. Kenny T.A. McGrath C.F. Wipf P.

However, we find that the tetrapeptide in our case has a lower Ki than the heptapeptide. However, it is worth exploring the effects of adding residues to the C terminus. The structural work presented here will form the basis for design of more potent inhibitors for this neurotoxin.

https://openalex.org/W2030627771,"Background Concern about costs and antiretroviral therapy (ART)-associated toxicities led to the consideration of CD4 driven strategies for the management of HIV. That approach was evaluated in the SMART trial that reported an unexpected increase of cardiovascular events after treatment interruption (TI). Our goal was to evaluate fasting metabolic changes associated with interruption of antiretroviral therapy and relate them to changes of immune activation markers and cardiovascular risk. Methodology ACTG 5102 enrolled 47 HIV-1-infected subjects on stable ART, with <200 HIV RNA copies/mL and CD4 cell count ≥500 cells/µL. Subjects were randomly assigned to continue ART for 18 weeks with or without 3 cycles of interleukin-2 (IL-2) (cycle = 4.5 million IU sc BID x 5 days every 8 weeks). After 18 weeks ART was discontinued in all subjects until the CD4 cell count dropped below 350 cells/µL. Glucose and lipid parameters were evaluated every 8 weeks initially and at weeks 2, 4, 8 and every 8 weeks after TI. Immune activation was evaluated by flow-cytometry and soluble TNFR2 levels. Principal Findings By week 8 of TI, levels of total cholesterol (TC) (median (Q1, Q3) (−0.73 (−1.19, −0.18) mmol/L, p<0.0001), LDL, HDL cholesterol (−0.36(−0.73,−0.03)mmol/L, p = 0.0007 and −0.05(−0.26,0.03), p = 0.0033, respectively) and triglycerides decreased (−0.40 (−0.84, 0.07) mmol/L, p = 0.005). However the TC/HDL ratio remained unchanged (−0.09 (−1.2, 0.5), p = 0.2). Glucose and insulin levels did not change (p = 0.6 and 0.8, respectively). After TI there was marked increase in immune activation (CD8+/HLA-DR+/CD38+ cells, 34% (13, 43), p<0.0001) and soluble TNFR2 (1089 ng/L (−189, 1655), p = 0.0008) coinciding with the rebound of HIV viremia. Conclusions Our data suggests that interrupting antiretroviral therapy does not reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, as the improvements in lipid parameters are modest and overshadowed by the decreased HDL levels. Increased immune cell activation and systemic inflammatory responses associated with recrudescent HIV viremia may provide a more cogent explanation for the increased cardiovascular risk associated with treatment interruption and HIV infection.

https://openalex.org/W2059482132,"The regulation of gene transcription requires posttranslational modifications of histones that, in concert with chromatin remodeling factors, shape the structure of chromatin. It is currently under intense investigation how this structure is modulated, in particular in the context of proliferation and differentiation. Compelling evidence suggests that the transcription factor NF-Y acts as a master regulator of cell cycle progression, activating the transcription of many cell cycle regulatory genes. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet completely understood. Here we show that NF-Y exerts its effect on transcription through the modulation of the histone ""code"". NF-Y colocalizes with nascent RNA, while RNA polymerase II is I phosphorylated on serine 2 of the YSPTSPS repeats within its carboxyterminal domain and histones are carrying modifications that represent activation signals of gene expression (H3K9ac and PAN-H4ac). Comparing postmitotic muscle tissue from normal mice and proliferating muscles from mdx mice, we demonstrate by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) that NF-Y DNA binding activity correlates with the accumulation of acetylated histones H3 and H4 on promoters of key cell cycle regulatory genes, and with their active transcription. Accordingly, p300 is recruited onto the chromatin of NF-Y target genes in a NF-Y-dependent manner, as demonstrated by Re-ChIP. Conversely, the loss of NF-Y binding correlates with a decrease of acetylated histones, the recruitment of HDAC1, and a repressed heterochromatic state with enrichment of histones carrying modifications known to mediate silencing of gene expression (H3K9me3, H3K27me2 and H4K20me3). As a consequence, NF-Y target genes are downregulated in this context. In conclusion, our data indicate a role of NF-Y in modulating the structure and transcriptional competence of chromatin in vivo and support a model in which NF-Y-dependent histone ""code"" changes contribute to the proper discrimination between proliferating and postmitotic cells in vivo and in vitro."

In human plasma, two-thirds of the PAF-AH activity are found associated with LDL and one-third circulates as a complex with HDL. This distribution profile varies among species, possibly because of differences among PAF-AH orthologs, combined with a wide diversity of lipoprotein levels and composition. Our previous studies suggested that intrinsic properties of PAF-AH played important roles as determinants of the location of the enzyme in vivo (7Stafforini D.M. Tjoelker L.W. McCormick S.P.

These observations suggest that the distribution of PAF-AH in lipoproteins may define its physio-pathological function in humans. We previously reported that PAF-AH can migrate among lipoproteins (12Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Carter M.E. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), found that the location of the enzyme impacts its catalytic activity (13Stafforini D.M. Carter M.E. Zimmerman G.A.

Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Trans. Assoc. Am Physicians. 1992; 105: 44-63PubMed Google Scholar). These combined observations suggest that the lipoprotein environment regulates the function of PAF-AH, and they underscore the need to precisely characterize the nature of these interactions. Here, we report that individual species display unique lipoprotein distribution profiles and seem to utilize distinct PAF-AH domains to associate with the particles. In addition, we report the identification of key C-terminal residues required for association of human PAF-AH with human HDL. These studies are likely to facilitate the development of much needed in vivo model systems that faithfully recapitulate the unique lipoprotein distribution of human plasma PAF-AH and that can potentially be utilized to assess the role of the lipoprotein environment on the function of this enzyme. Materials—[3H-acetyl]PAF was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ) and unlabeled PAF was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Pfu was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and dNTPs were purchased from Fermentas Inc. (Hanover, MD). Pefabloc was from Calbiochem. Secondary antibodies were purchased from BioSource International (Camarillo, CA). All other reagents were from Sigma. In some experiments we utilized recombinant human PAF-AH (Pafase®), which was a generous gift from ICOS Corporation (Bothell, WA). This protein was expressed as a truncation product starting at M-46 and was purified from bacterial sources. HDL particles were isolated as previously described (12Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Carter M.E. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were treated with Pefabloc according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The Pefabloc-treated HDL (pHDL) was subjected to exhaustive dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline, at 4 °C. PAF-AH Activity Determinations—PAF-AH activity was determined by our previously described radiometric assay, using [3H-acetyl]PAF as the substrate (15Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 344-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We separated excess substrate from the product, [3H-acetate], by reverse phase column chromatography, as described (15Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 344-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Mutant Generation and Vectors—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by a two-step amplification protocol using Pfu as the polymerase, as previously described (16MacRitchie A.N. Gardner A.A. Prescott S.M. Stafforini D.M. Faseb. J. 2007; 21: 1164-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A FLAG tag was inserted at the N-terminal end to facilitate immunoblot detection and purification. The products were cloned into a pUC cloning vector under the control of the tryptophan promoter, as described (16MacRitchie A.N. Gardner A.A. Prescott S.M. Stafforini D.M. Faseb. J. 2007; 21: 1164-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was purified using a plasmid miniprep purification kit (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA). Expression and Purification of Mutant and Chimeric Proteins—We generated various truncated forms of PAF-AH that started at Leu-41 and Ile-42 for mouse and human PAF-AH, respectively, and expressed the recombinant proteins in the Escherichia coli strain BL-21. Protein extracts were obtained as previously described (16MacRitchie A.N. Gardner A.A. Prescott S.M. Stafforini D.M. Faseb. J. 2007; 21: 1164-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Where indicated, the supernatants were purified using anti-FLAG affinity beads, following the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Sigma). We determined enzymatic activity and protein content of the mutant preparations recovered after purification and assessed the level of expression by Western analyses using a monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2) antibody (Sigma), as described (3Stremler K.E. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11095-11103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, the mutant proteins expressed significant levels of PAF-AH activity and mass, suggesting that the folding of the recombinant proteins was comparable to that of wild-type PAF-AH. HDL Binding Assay—To test binding to HDL we incubated a source of PAF-AH with pHDL (range: 4–29 mg) for 30–120 min at 37 °C, in a total volume of 500 μl. The amount of detergent was normalized and kept at a level that did not affect the integrity of HDL particles as judged by their ability to bind wild-type PAF-AH. The mixtures then were adjusted to a volume of 10 ml and a density of 1.3 g/ml with solid KBr. The solutions were layered with 0.9% NaCl and centrifuged at 50,000 rpm in a VTi 50 Beckman rotor, for 3 h at 4°C. The gradients were fractionated, and individual fractions were assayed for PAF-AH activity, as described (15Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 344-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Where indicated, we utilized “modified” KBr density gradients designed to improve resolution in the heavy density region. These gradients were identical to those described above except that they were generated by layering 20 ml of a 1.3 g/ml KBr solution containing pHDL and PAF-AH with 0.9% NaCl. The Association of Plasma PAF-AH with Lipoproteins and the Total Levels of Enzymatic Activity Vary among Species—Previous studies reported differences in the distribution of PAF-AH activity in human compared with mouse or rat plasma, but to our knowledge no comparative studies among species have been presented to date. We investigated the distribution of PAF-AH activity in freshly isolated plasma from six different species and found vast differences in the distribution pattern among lipoproteins (Fig. 1). PAF-AH associated with both LDL and HDL in plasma from bovine, canine, and human sources (Fig. 1, A–C). However, the distribution between lipoprotein particles varied among the three species; notably, humans were the only species in which most of the circulating PAF-AH associated with LDL. In rat plasma, PAF-AH associated exclusively with HDL particles, in agreement with a previous report (Fig. 1D) (17Pritchard P.H. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 791-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Initial studies revealed that the densities of HDL particles with which PAF-AH associated were higher in guinea pig and mouse compared with other species (not shown), so it was necessary to adapt the standard fractionation protocol to improve resolution in the heavy density region. We adjusted the density of the gradients as described under “Experimental Procedures” and found almost complete association of guinea pig and mouse PAF-AH activities with HDL particles (Fig. 1, E and F), as previously reported (18Theilmeier G. De Geest B. Van Veldhoven P.P. Stengel D. Michiels C. Lox M. Landeloos M. Chapman M.J. Ninio E. Collen D. Himpens B. Holvoet P. Faseb.

Our studies also provided a quantitative comparison of the total amount of plasma PAF-AH activity expressed in six species tested. Interestingly, species in which PAF-AH associated with both HDL and LDL expressed lower total levels of activity compared with those in which the location of the enzyme was limited to HDL particles (Table 1).TABLE 1Expression levels of PAF-AH activity in freshly isolated plasma samples from various speciesPlasma sourcePAF-AH activitynmol/min/mlnmol/min/mgBovine47.7 ± 0.60.33 ± 0.01Human73.2 ± 6.81.23 ± 0.23Dog61.4 ± 2.02.32 ± 0.15Rat183.1 ± 3.13.89 ± 0.13Guinea pig234.1 ± 9.510.78 ± 0.88Mouse630.0 ± 5.215.72 ± 0.26 Open table in a new tab Development and Characterization of a PAF-AH/HDL Binding Assay—To characterize the nature of the interaction between PAF-AH and HDL particles, we developed a binding assay that consisted of incubating either the purified recombinant enzyme, or solubilized extracts expressing various mutant and chimeric PAF-AH constructs, with Pefabloc-treated human HDL particles that lacked enzymatic activity (p-hHDL). To assess the extent of binding to p-hHDL, we subjected the mixtures to ultracentrifugation, fractionation, and activity determinations. We found that under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures” the human wild-type enzyme, supplied in either purified form or as a solubilized bacterial extract, associated with particles of density identical to that of natural PAF-AH-containing human HDL particles (compare Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1A). Optimal binding was observed after incubation for 1 h at 37°C (supplemental Fig. S1B). To ensure that the amount of p-hHDL supplemented to each assay was not the factor limiting the extent of binding, we varied the amount of p-hHDL using a fixed level of PAF-AH and found comparable results when p-hHDL ranged between 9 and 29 mg (supplemental Fig. S1C). Additional studies showed that p-hHDL levels could be further reduced to 4 mg without affecting the extent of binding (not shown). We also found that a fixed amount of p-hHDL (9 mg) supported binding of PAF-AH over a relatively wide range of enzyme concentrations (supplemental Fig. S1D). These combined results identified experimental conditions that resulted in optimal binding of PAF-AH to exogenous human HDL. In addition, the studies demonstrated that solubilized bacterial extracts behaved in a manner equivalent to that of purified enzyme sources. Subjecting various types of PAF-AH-containing samples to the binding assay in the absence of exogenous p-hHDL resulted in complete loss of enzymatic activity (not shown). Mouse and Human PAF-AHs Associate with Human HDL Particles of Different Density—Our next goal was to investigate whether association of PAF-AH with HDL was defined by the enzyme, the lipoprotein particles, or both. To address this issue, we compared the ability of the mouse and human enzymes to associate with heterologous p-HDL particles. Because the density of mouse PAF-AH-containing HDL particles was higher than that of human particles (Fig. 1), we adjusted the density of the gradients to optimize separation within the HDL region, as described above for Fig. 1, E and F. This enabled us to clearly identify a peak of PAF-AH-containing HDL particles in mouse serum (fractions 5–9, Fig. 2A). The association of endogenous PAF-AH with lipoproteins was not affected by this technical adjustment as judged by the similar behavior of the human plasma enzyme in the two types of gradients (compare Figs. 1C and 2B). We next found that mouse and human PAF-AHs associated with Pefabloc-treated murine HDL (p-mHDL) particles of the same density (i.e. fractions 5–9, Fig. 2C). In contrast, we observed that human PAF-AH associated with lighter p-hHDL particles compared with mouse PAF-AH (Fig. 2D). These results suggested that the mechanisms that govern association of PAF-AH with HDL vary among species and include contributions from both the enzyme and the lipoprotein particles. In addition, these results provided the basis for the next series of experiments. The C-terminal End of Human PAF-AH Mediates Binding to Human HDL—We next focused our studies on the identification of domain(s) responsible for the association of human PAF-AH with p-hHDL. The observation that the mouse and human enzymes associated with p-hHDL particles of different density (Fig. 2D) provided us with a tool to search for discrete protein domains that contributed to the interaction. Our strategy consisted of replacing regions within human PAF-AH with corresponding sequences derived from the mouse ortholog, and then testing binding of the chimeric constructs to p-hHDL (Fig. 3A, Ref. 16MacRitchie A.N. Gardner A.A. Prescott S.M. Stafforini D.M. Faseb. J. 2007; 21: 1164-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We found that replacement of residues 339–441 in the human protein with the corresponding murine sequences (construct V) resulted in a chimeric protein whose behavior differed from that of wild-type PAF-AH (compare Fig. 3, B and G). In contrast, the remaining chimeric constructs (constructs I-IV) displayed binding to p-hHDL similar to that of the wild-type human enzyme (Fig. 3, C–F). To further investigate the role of individual PAF-AH domains in binding to p-hHDL, we utilized a complementary approach. We generated a second set of chimeric constructs in which we increased the contribution of sequences derived from human PAF-AH, as we proportionately decreased representation of the mouse protein (Fig. 4A). We next tested the ability of these constructs to associate with p-hHDL and found evidence confirming a requirement for the human C terminus in binding to p-hHDL (Fig. 4, B–E). These studies supported and refined our previous findings as they revealed that human PAF-AH associated with p-hHDL through a domain comprised of amino acids 340 and 415.FIGURE 4The C-terminal end of human PAF-AH confers the mouse ortholog the ability to associate with human HDL.

To accomplish this, we cloned the guinea pig and rat PAF-AH cDNAs, expressed and purified the recombinant proteins, and then investigated whether they associated with p-hHDL. We found that the behavior of these proteins differed from that of human PAF-AH and resembled the binding pattern displayed by the murine ortholog (compare supplemental Fig. S2 and Fig. 4B). Next, we aligned the sequences comprised by amino acids 340–415 from the human, mouse, rat, and guinea pig orthologs and searched for residues in the human sequence that were absent in all the rodent orthologs (Fig. 5A). This led to the identification of Arg-347, His-367, Lys-370, Asn-378, Ala-379, Ser-384, and Ile-409 as candidates for further testing (Fig. 5A). We generated human R347K and N378R mutants and found that these mutants displayed normal binding to p-hHDL (Fig. 5, B and C). Next, we replaced the mouse string NKLT comprising residues 366–369 with HMLK, corresponding to amino acids 367–370 in the human protein. Interestingly, the resulting chimeric construct (mHMLK) associated with p-hHDL in a manner similar to that of the human wild-type protein (Fig. 5D). As expected, mHMLK constructs that mimicked the human protein at residues 384 and 409 behaved in a manner comparable to that of the mHMLK mutant (not shown). The role of Ala-379 will be discussed below. These results suggested a key role for the HMLK domain in the interaction of PAF-AH with p-hHDL. To characterize contributions from individual residues within the HMLK domain, we conducted additional experiments (Fig. 6A). We found that mutation of residues Met-368 and Leu-369 prevented binding to p-hHDL (Fig. 6, C and D). In addition, individual replacement of His-367 and Lys-370 with the corresponding mouse residues affected binding to a lesser extent (Fig. 6, B and E). These combined results further establish participation of the HMLK domain in the association of human PAF-AH with p-hHDL. Our results provide a possible explanation to account for the failure of rodent PAF-AH orthologs to associate with p-hHDL.FIGURE 6Individual contribution of residues within the HMLK domain to association with human HDL. A, amino acid alignment of human, mouse, rat, and guinea pig PAF-AHs in the C-terminal region comprised by amino acids 367–370. B–E, binding of human PAF-AH mutants H367N, M368K, L369A, and K370T to human HDL. Solubilized extracts expressing the proteins indicated (5 nmol/min) were incubated with p-hHDL (range: 12.1–4.1 mg) and subjected to ultracentrifugation. All the studies depicted in this figure were conducted using standard KBr density gradients.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Naturally Occurring Polymorphic Forms of PAF-AH Display Normal Binding to Human HDL—The human plasma PAF-AH gene displays several polymorphisms and three of them (R92H, I198T, and A379V) result in amino acid changes that have been described in the Caucasian population (20Karasawa K.

The results depicted in Fig. 4 did not allow us to rule out contributions from these residues to binding to p-hHDL. First, Arg-92 is conserved between the human and mouse orthologs; second, there is a conservative substitution at position 198 of the mouse ortholog (Val-197); third, a valine replaces Ala-379 in the mouse ortholog. To investigate whether the presence of these polymorphisms affected association of human PAF-AH with p-hHDL, we expressed human constructs R92H, I198T, and A379V and then tested the ability of extracts expressing the recombinant proteins to bind to the lipoprotein. We found (Fig. 7) that the three naturally occurring PAF-AH polymorphic forms displayed normal binding to p-hHDL. In addition, introduction of a histidine or a threonine residue at positions 91 and 197, respectively, of the mouse HMLK mutant (see Fig. 5D) did not prevent association with p-hHDL (not shown). These combined data firmly establish that the polymorphic forms of PAF-AH R92H, I198T, and A379V retain the ability to associate with HDL. In recent years, PAF-AH has become known as Lp-PLA2 because of the fact that the activity circulates in plasma as a complex with LDL and HDL (12Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Carter M.E. Prescott S.M.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 2Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylglycerol is not only a metabolic precursor in the biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of cardiolipin but itself is an important phospholipid; for example it is the sole phospholipid of thylakoid membranes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic oxygenic photosynthetic organisms (3Sato N. J. Plant Res. 2004; 117: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In mammals, PG is especially important in pulmonary surfactant, an essential fluid produced by alveolar type II cells that covers the entire surface of the lung (4Gunther A. Ruppert C. Schmidt R. Markart P. Grimminger F. Walmrath D. Seeger W. Respir. Res. 2001; 2: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Considering the importance of this anionic phospholipid, little is known about the mechanisms by which eukaryotic cells control PG membrane composition. In yeast cells, PG is a low abundance phospholipid, present at best as a few tenths of a percent of total cellular phospholipids, even under the conditions of respiratory growth (5Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Mileykovskaya E. Voelker D.R. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14933-14941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Therefore, PG is considered to be mainly a metabolic precursor to CL. Biosynthesis of CL starts with common intermediates of phospholipid biosynthesis, phosphatidic acid and CDP-diacylglycerol (DAG) (Fig. 1). Phosphatidylglycerol phosphate (PGP) is formed from CDP-DAG and glycerol 3-phosphate. This step is catalyzed by PGP synthase, product of the PGS1/PEL1 gene (6Janitor M. Subik J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9829-9836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). PGP is subsequently dephosphorylated to form PG. Finally, CL is synthesized in yeast and other eukaryotic organisms from CDP-DAG and PG via a reaction catalyzed by cardiolipin synthase (CRD1) (5Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Mileykovskaya E. Voelker D.R.

It is important to note that both CL and PG are subject to intense remodeling subsequent to their de novo synthesis (10Schlame M. Rustow B. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial phospholipid biosynthetic activities in general respond to factors affecting mitochondrial development and function, such as carbon source, growth phase, availability of oxygen, and mutations affecting mitochondrial development and function (11Gaynor P.M. Hubbell S. Schmidt A.J. Lina R.A. Minskoff S.A. Greenberg M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6124-6131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Li G. Chen S. Thompson M.N. Greenberg M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In fact, both enzymatic activities of the CL biosynthetic pathway, PGP synthase and CL synthase, respond to mitochondrial development factors in such a way as to increase the production of CL when cells switch from fermentative to respiratory growth (13Jiang F. Gu Z. Granger J.M. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Shen H. Dowhan W. J. Biol.

A typical feature of yeast phospholipid biosynthesis is its regulation by soluble precursors of phospholipid biosynthesis, inositol and choline. Much of this regulation occurs at the transcriptional level (for review see Refs. 16Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 17Henry S.A.

Chem. 2007; 282: 37293-37297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Many yeast phospholipid biosynthetic genes contain in their promoters inositol-sensitive upstream-activated sequence and are derepressed in the absence of inositol and repressed in the presence of inositol. This gene activation and repression are facilitated by two transcription factors, Ino2p and Ino4p (19Ambroziak J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15344-15349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a negative regulator, Opi1p (20White M.J. Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CL branch of the yeast phospholipid biosynthetic pathway is also repressed by the presence of exogenous inositol. This repression occurs mostly at the formation of PGP, a rate-limiting reaction of the pathway catalyzed by PGP synthase (15Zhong Q. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33978-33984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Greenberg M.L. Hubbell S. Lam C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4773-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This repressive effect of inositol on the PGP synthase activity is not altered in mutants with defective or missing transcriptional regulators Ino2p, Ino4p, or Opi1p, indicating a mechanism other than transcriptional repression (15Zhong Q. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33978-33984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Post-translational regulation of PGP synthase activity via phosphorylation was recently found to be responsible for rapid decrease in PGP synthase activity upon addition of inositol (22He Q. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1243-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The PGP phosphatase and CL synthase activities appear not to be regulated by inositol (23Tamai K.T. Greenberg M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1046: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but a novel regulation of the CRD1 gene by Ino4p has been recently reported (24Su X. Dowhan W. Yeast. 2006; 23: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is believed that PG can substitute for CL in most cellular functions in yeast, as demonstrated by the absence of any gross mitochondrial dysfunction in crd1Δ mutant (5Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Mileykovskaya E. Voelker D.R. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14933-14941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 8Tuller G. Hrastnik C. Achleitner G. Schiefthaler U.

Microbiol. 1997; 26: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, not all CL functions can be substituted for by PG, because a CL-deficient mutant has decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased maximum respiratory rate, and decreased ATPase and cytochrome c activities (25Jiang F. Ryan M.T. Schlame M. Zhao M. Gu Z. Klingenberg M. Pfanner N. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22387-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Absence of both PG and CL, as occurs in a PGS1/PEL1 deletion mutant, causes more severe phenotypes: dependence on a fermentable carbon source for growth, temperature sensitivity, and “petite lethality” (7Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9829-9836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 26Janitor M. Jarosch E. Schweyen R.J. Subik J. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1223-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, the use of osmotic stabilizers in the growth medium alleviated reported inability of pgs1Δ mutant to grow in the presence of ethidium bromide (27Zhong Q. Gvozdenovic-Jeremic J. Webster P. Zhou J. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), demonstrating that mitochondrial anionic phospholipids and functional mitochondria are required for cell wall biogenesis (28Zhong Q. Li G. Gvozdenovic-Jeremic J. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15946-15953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, simultaneous deletion of PGS1/PEL1 and CHO1 (encoding for phosphatidylserine synthase) is synthetically lethal even on media supplemented by ethanolamine or choline, suggesting that simultaneous loss of three phospholipids with a negative charge is incompatible with cell viability (29Janitor M. Obernauerova M. Kohlwein S.D. Subik J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 140: 43-47PubMed Google Scholar). Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases (GPDEs) hydrolyze glycerophosphodiesters, such as glycerophosphocholine and glycerophosphoethanolamine, produced through phospholipid deacylation. Products of two Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORFs, YPL206c and YPL110c, share significant sequence homology with bacterial and mammalian GPDEs (30Zheng B. Berrie C.P. Corda D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1745-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that the product of YPL110c indeed possesses glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase activity (31Fernandez-Murray J.P. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38290-38296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 32Fisher E. Almaguer C. Holic R. Griac P. Patton-Vogt J. J. Biol.

In this study we report that the product of ORF YPL206c (here named PGC1 for phosphatidylglycerol phospholipase C) controls the PG content of membranes via a phospholipase C-type degradation mechanism. This conclusion is based on the following observations. (i) In the absence of Pgc1p, PG accumulates in the cells despite the fact that neither production of PGP nor formation of CL from PG are changed. (ii) An in vitro assay to monitor PG degradation products shows that yeast extracts devoid of Pgc1p exhibit much less PG-oriented phospholipase C activity compared with wild-type yeast extracts.

Dawson P. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Yeast transformation was performed by the lithium acetate method (35Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). Yeast strains PGY223 and PGY224 were obtained from Research Genetics. Multicopy plasmid B95 containing YPL206c ORF (PGC1) was prepared as follows: cosmid 70982 (ATCC) was digested with XbaI and EcoRI to release a 4827-bp fragment containing PGC1 together with two neighboring ORFs. This DNA fragment was ligated into XbaI and EcoRI sites of plasmid YEplac195 (36Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar), creating plasmid B91. Plasmid B91 was digested with XhoI and StuI to release only PGC1 and its flanking sequences (497 bp upstream and 982 bp downstream). The released fragment was ligated into SalI and SmaI sites of YEplac195 to create plasmid B95. pGAL-GST-PGC1 allele was prepared as follows: fragment containing regulatable GAL1 promoter, the glutathione S-transferase (GST) and 40-bp homology to the target sequence was obtained using pFA6a-kanMX-PGAL-GST as a PCR template (37Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar) using forward primer 5′-AGT GTC GAA CCT TTC TTC TCT TTG TAT TTC AAC CAC GTT CCA GAA TTC GAGCTC GTT TAA AC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATA TCT TGC TTT AAA AGC TCT GTG GCC CAC AAT TTC AAC CAT ACG CGG AAC CAG ATC CGA TT-3′. The underlined sequences are homologous to the PGC1 gene region. Obtained PCR product was transformed into BY4741 strain using lithium acetate procedure (35Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar), and G418-resistant colonies were selected. To verify integration at the correct location, genomic DNA was isolated and used as a template in PCR reaction using forward primer 5′-CAA CGA CTT GTA GCC AAC ATA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AGG TTT AAA GAT GCT ACT AAG-3′. Integration of the PCR module resulted in the following changes in the genomic DNA: (i) deletion of ∼500 bp immediately upstream of the native PGC1 start codon and replacement with the GAL1 promoter and (ii) fusion of the PGC1 gene to the 5′-end of PGC1. The resulting strain was named pGAL-GST-PGC1 (PGY241). Plasmid pPIC3.5K+PGC1 to express Pgc1p in P. pastoris was prepared as follows: PGC1 gene was amplified from plasmid B95 as PCR template using primers BamHI-PGC1 5′-ATCA-GGATCCATGGTTGAAATTGTGGGCCAC-3′ and PGC1-EcoRI 5′-CGTCGAATTCCTCGCGGAGAGAAAGGGTTC-3′. Underlined are BamHI and EcoRI recognition sites. A 1094-bp-long PCR fragment was gel-purified and inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pPIC3.5K plasmid (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid pPIC3.5K+PGC1 was transformed into P. pastoris strain GS115 using electroporation protocol according to Wu and Letchworth (38Wu S. Letchworth G.J. BioTechniques. 2004; 36: 152-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Mitochondria—Yeast mitochondria were isolated as described previously (39Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, spheroplasts were prepared using Zymolyase 20T from cells grown in I– URA-medium to late logarithmic phase of growth. The spheroplasts were then homogenized in a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer in 0.6 m manitol, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 5,000 × g to remove residual cell debris. The supernatant was saved and centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 × g. The final mitochondrial pellet was washed twice in 0.6 m manitol, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and resuspended in washing buffer at the approximate final concentration of 10 mg of protein/ml. Highly purified mitochondria for localization studies were prepared accordingly to the procedure of Zinser et al. (40Zinser E. Sperka-Gottlieb C.D. Fasch E.V. Kohlwein S.D. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2026-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) using a linear sucrose gradient of 30 to 60%. Isolation of Yeast Lipid Particles—Lipid particles of yeast were isolated according to Leber et al. (41Leber R. Zinser E. Zellnig G. Paltauf F. Daum G. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1421-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) from cells grown to early stationary phase of growth. Western Blot Analysis—Immunological characterization of subcellular fractions was carried out after separating proteins on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferring to nitrocellulose filters (42Haid A. Suissa M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Proteins were detected using rabbit antibodies (Sigma) against the respective antigens; anti-GST for GST-Pgc1p (Sigma), anti-Erg7p for lanosterol synthase (generous gift of G. Daum, Technical University of Graz, Austria), and anti-Aac2p for mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier protein (generous gift of I. Hapala, Institute of Animal Biochemistry and Genetics, Ivanka pri Dunaji, Slovakia). Steady-state Phospholipid Analysis—To determine steady-state phospholipid composition, strains were grown in I+ or I– synthetic media (5 ml) containing 5 μCi of [32P]orthophosphoric acid/ml. The cultures were harvested in mid to late logarithmic phase of growth after five to six generations of aerobic growth at 30 °C. Lipids were extracted by using a modified Folch extraction (43Atkinson K.D. Jensen B. Kolat A.I. Storm E.M. Henry S.A. Fogel S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 558-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and individual phospholipids were resolved by two-dimensional paper chromatography (44Steiner M.R. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 222-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), visualized by phosphorimaging, and quantified by Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Pulse Labeling of Phospholipids—To determine the rate of phospholipid synthesis yeast cells were pulse-labeled for 45 or 90 min in I– medium (0.5% glucose) with 50 μCi of [32P]orthophosphoric acid/ml, followed by lipid extraction as described (45Gu Z. Valianpour F. Chen S. Vaz F.M. Hakkaart G.A. Wanders R.J. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Harvested cells were spheroplasted for 15 min in 1 ml of digestion mixture (1.2 m glycerol, 100 mm sodium thioglycolate, 50 mm Tris-SO4, pH 7.5, and 2.5 mg/ml Zymolyase 20T). Spheroplasts were subsequently collected by centrifugation, and lipids were extracted with 5 ml of chloroform-methanol (2:1) for 1 h at room temperature by occasional vortexing. 1 ml of water was added, and the phases were separated by centrifugation. The organic phase was dried under a stream of nitrogen. Phospholipids were separated and quantified as described above for steady state analysis. PGP Synthase Activity—PGP synthase activity was determined by quantification of the incorporation of radiolabeled substrate [14C]glycerol-3-phosphate into chloroform-soluble product PGP (46Carman G.M. Belunis C.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1983; 29: 1452-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in I– URA-medium to late-logarithmic phase of growth. The PGP synthase assay was performed in the presence of 50 mm MES-Cl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm CDP-DAG, 1 mm Triton X-100, 0.02 mm [14C]glycerol-3-phosphate (100,000 cpm/nmol) and mitochondrial fraction corresponding to 100 μg of mitochondrial protein in a total volume of 100 μl. The reaction was stopped after 20 min by the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.1 n HCl in methanol, and the lipids were extracted with 1 ml of chloroform and 1.5 ml of 1 m MgCl2. Aliquots of 0.5 ml of the chloroform layer were transferred into scintillation vials and evaporated under the stream of nitrogen. Scintillation mixture (3 ml) was added, and the radioactivity of each sample was determined with scintillation counter. A unit of enzymatic activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 nmol of product/min under the assay conditions described above. The specific activity is defined as units/mg of protein. In Vitro Assay for Lipid Degradation Activity—Enzymatic PG degradation activities of mitochondrial fractions were assayed by measuring the conversion of fluorescently labeled substrate NBD-PG or 14C-labeled PG. The assay mix contained 20 μlof 0.3 m MES, pH 6.5, 20 μl of NBD-PG (1 μg) in 0.1% Triton X-100, and 80 μl of mitochondrial protein (100 μg) in a total volume of 120 μl. The typical reaction was allowed to proceed for 40 min at 30 °C. After this incubation time the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 ml of chloroform-methanol-HCl (100:100:0.6), followed by the addition of 1 ml of water to produce two phases. The samples were vortexed, and aliquots of 0.9 ml of the organic layer were dried under a stream of nitrogen. NBD species were resolved by one-dimensional TLC chromatography on silica plates for 30 min using chloroform-methanol-28% ammonium hydroxide (65:35:5) as mobile phase (47Pagano R.E. Longmuir K.J. Martin O.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2034-2040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NBD-containing molecules were visualized by using a PhosphorImager Typhoon (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The major NBD-PG degradation product under these assay conditions, NBD-DAG, was identified based on comparison with the NBD-PG degradation product of B. cereus phospholipase C (Sigma) (48Trotter P.J. Traffic. 2000; 1: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The 14C-labeled PG was prepared accordingly to Tuller et al. (8Tuller G. Hrastnik C. Achleitner G. Schiefthaler U. Klein F. Daum G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) from double mutant yeast strain PGY254 (crd1Δ pgc1Δ). This strain accumulates PG up to 7% of total phospholipids when grown in I– media. The assay conditions were the same as for the NBD-PG assay with these modifications: enzymatic assay mix contained radiolabeled PG corresponding to 5000 cpm, and the reaction products were resolved by one-dimensional TLC chromatography on silica plates using petroleum ether-diethylether-acetic acid (70:30:2). Radioactivity associated with DAG spots was quantified by liquid scintillation. Ypl206cp (Pgc1p) Displays Homology to Glycerophosphodiester Phosphodiesterases—Two proteins encoded by S. cerevisiae ORFs YPL206c and YPL110c, share significant sequence homology to bacterial and mammalian glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases (for sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis see Ref. 30Zheng B. Berrie C.P. Corda D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1745-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The product of YPL110c was recently identified as a glycerophosphocholine-specific phosphodiesterase (31Fernandez-Murray J.P. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38290-38296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 32Fisher E. Almaguer C. Holic R. Griac P. Patton-Vogt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36110-36117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and the coding gene was named GDE1. The role of the product of ORF YPL206c (PGC1) in homeostasis of yeast phospholipids is the subject of this report. PGC1 is located on the left arm of chromosome 16 and encodes a protein of 321 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 37 kDa. The NCBI CDART tool (49Marchler-Bauer A. Anderson J.B.

Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) predicts the GPDE motif to be present at the N terminus of the Pgc1p (Fig. 2A). Importantly for our study, the Superfamily HMM library and genome assignments server (51Wilson D. Madera M. Vogel C. Chothia C. Gough J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D308-D313Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 52Gough J. Karplus K. Hughey R. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 903-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar) assigns Pgc1p to the superfamily of PLC-like phosphodiesterases. In addition, the C terminus of the protein contains a potential single pass membrane anchor localized at amino acids 297–315 (SwissProt data base) (Fig. 2B). Deletion of PGC1 Leads to Accumulation of Phosphatidylglycerol—In our attempt to understand the role of Pgc1p in lipid homeostasis, steady-state phospholipid analysis was performed with wild-type and pgc1Δ strains. These experiments were performed in yeast synthetic media with different combinations of the phospholipid biosynthesis precursors, inositol and choline, that are known to regulate lipid metabolism (Table 2). The most striking difference in steady-state phospholipid composition between wild-type and pgc1Δ strains is accumulation of PG in the pgc1Δ strain. This accumulation is more evident in media without inositol, where PG amounts to ∼3% of total cellular phospholipids compared with a few tenths of a percent in wild-type cells. Addition of choline does not change the pattern of PG accumulation (data not shown). Accumulation of PG is evident also in media with inositol, however, the amounts of PG in both wild-type and pgc1Δ strains are much lower. Other phospholipids, including CL, were either unchanged or display only minor changes upon PGC1 deletion.TABLE 2Steady-state phospholipid composition of the pgc1Δ mutant compared to wild-type strainMediumStrainPGCLPAaPA, phosphatidic acid; PS, phosphatidylserine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; WT, wild type.PCPEPIPSOtherI-C-WT0.21 ± 0.241.91 ± 0.852.86 ± 0.4445.50 ± 0.9619.63 ± 1.119.36 ± 0.2110.58 ± 0.709.95 ± 2.85pgc1Δ2.75 ± 0.431.70 ± 0.822.85 ± 0.2244.75 ± 4.2719.84 ± 2.788.48 ± 2.138.80 ± 1.6210.17 ± 3.66I+C-WTNDbND, not detectable.2.84 ± 2.181.78 ± 0.3927.88 ± 3.6121.11 ± 2.5228.96 ± 1.517.76 ± 0.169.67 ± 1.39pgc1Δ0.36 ± 0.512.55 ± 1.671.79 ± 0.0627.55 ± 1.4321.34 ± 1.5729.46 ± 0.897.21 ± 0.609.73 ± 1.68a PA, phosphatidic acid; PS, phosphatidylserine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; WT, wild type.b ND, not detectable.

https://openalex.org/W1966662414,"In Asia, breast cancer is characterised by an early age of onset: In Malaysia, approximately 50% of cases occur in women under the age of 50 years. A proportion of these cases may be attributable, at least in part, to genetic components, but to date, the contribution of genetic components to breast cancer in many of Malaysia's ethnic groups has not been well-characterised.Given that hereditary breast carcinoma is primarily due to germline mutations in one of two breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, we have characterised the spectrum of BRCA mutations in a cohort of 37 individuals with early-onset disease (<or=40 years) and no reported family history. Mutational analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 was conducted by full sequencing of all exons and intron-exon junctions.Here, we report a total of 14 BRCA1 and 17 BRCA2 sequence alterations, of which eight are novel (3 BRCA1 and 5 BRCA2). One deleterious BRCA1 mutation and 2 deleterious BRCA2 mutations, all of which are novel mutations, were identified in 3 of 37 individuals. This represents a prevalence of 2.7% and 5.4% respectively, which is consistent with other studies in other Asian ethnic groups (4-9%)."
https://openalex.org/W2094505603,"The septins are a conserved family of proteins that have been proposed to carry out diverse functions. In budding yeast, the septins become localized to the site of bud emergence in G1 but have not been thought to carry out important functions at this stage of the cell cycle. We show here that the septins function in redundant mechanisms that are required for formation of the bud neck and for the normal pattern of cell growth early in the cell cycle. The Shs1 septin shows strong genetic interactions with G1 cyclins and is directly phosphorylated by G1 cyclin-dependent kinases, consistent with a role in early cell cycle events. However, Shs1 phosphorylation site mutants do not show genetic interactions with the G1 cyclins or obvious defects early in the cell cycle. Rather, they cause an increased cell size and aberrant cell morphology that are dependent upon inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1 at the G2/M transition. Shs1 phosphorylation mutants also show defects in interaction with the Gin4 kinase, which associates with the septins during G2/M and plays a role in regulating inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1. Phosphorylation of Shs1 by G1 cyclin-dependent kinases plays a role in events that influence Cdk1 inhibitory phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2008840572,"Marinobufagenin (MBG) is an endogenous mammalian cardiotonic steroid involved in the inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase. Increased plasma levels have been reported in patients with volume expansion-related hypertension. We have recently demonstrated that MBG impairs first trimester cytotrophoblast (CTB) cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, which may play a role in the development of preeclampsia. However, whether apoptosis contributes to altered CTB cell function by MBG remains unknown. Using the human extravillous CTB cell line SGHPL-4, we examined the effect of MBG and a similar Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor, ouabain, on the phosphorylation status of Jnk, p38, and Src. Additionally, we measured apoptosis by caspase 9 and 3/7 activity and by annexin-V staining. We also investigated interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion with or without p38 and Jnk inhibition. MBG significantly increased the phosphorylation of Jnk, p38, and Src and increased the expression of caspase 9 and 3/7 indicating the activation of apoptosis. MBG treatment also stimulated the expression of the early apoptosis marker, annexin-V, which was prevented by Jnk and p38 inhibition. MBG also stimulated the secretion of IL-6, which was attenuated by p38 inhibition. Ouabain had similar effects to those of MBG, suggesting that the apoptotic effects on CTB cells may be mediated by inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase. In conclusion, the MBG-induced impairment of CTB function occurs via activation of Jnk, p38, and Src leading to increased apoptosis and IL-6 secretion.

Preeclampsia is associated with shallow placentation, inadequate invasion, and insufficient remodeling of the maternal arteries (13Fisher S.J. Reprod. Biol.

In an animal model of preeclampsia, we have shown that urinary excretion of MBG is elevated prior to the development of hypertension indicating that it may play a key role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia (7Vu H.V. Ianosi-Irimie M.R. Pridjian C.A. Whitbred J.M. Durst J.M. Bagrov A.Y. Fedorova O.V. Pridjian G. Puschett J.B. Am. J. Nephrol. 2005; 25: 520-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, administration of an anti-MBG antibody corrected the deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertension in pregnant rats, which demonstrated elevated urinary excretion of MBG (7Vu H.V. Ianosi-Irimie M.R. Pridjian C.A. Whitbred J.M. Durst J.M. Bagrov A.Y. Fedorova O.V. Pridjian G. Puschett J.B. Am. J. Nephrol. 2005; 25: 520-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Durst J.

These findings suggest that MBG might affect first trimester CTB function. Recently, we demonstrated that MBG impairs the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CTB cells (17LaMarca H.L. Morris C.A. Pettit G.R. Nagowa T. Puschett J.B. Placenta. 2006; 27: 984-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Uddin M.N. Horvat D. Glaser S.S. Danchuk S. Mitchell B.M. Sullivan D.E.

Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling is known to play a critical role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation (19Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar, 20Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar, 21Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J.

In general, activated ERKs control cell proliferation and differentiation (19Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar, 20Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar, 21Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). On the other hand, stimulated Jnk and p38 pathways regulate cell proliferation, invasion, survival, migration, growth arrest, and apoptosis (19Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin.

Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2864) Google Scholar). The particular function regulated by MAPKs is likely to depend on the cell type, the stimulus, and the duration and strength of kinase activities. Activation of AKT increases cellular proliferation and protection from apoptosis through phosphorylation and inactivation of several effectors, including Bad and caspase 9 (26Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 27Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem.

Several studies have implicated caspases (cysteine aspartate-specific proteases) as the molecular instigators of apoptosis (29Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar, 30Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that cardiotonic steroids may have variable influences on cell proliferation, differentiation, and eventually cell death via Na+/K+-ATPase signaling pathways (31Schoner W. Scheiner-Bobis G. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: C509-C536Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In tumor cells, high concentrations of bufalin induce apoptosis, which is associated with an increase in intracellular Na+ because of inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase (32Kawazoe N. Aiuchi T. Masuda Y. Nakajo S. Nakaya K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, bufalin induces apoptosis in endometrial cells, which is associated with a down-regulation of the cell cycle and anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and the concomitant activation of Bax and caspase 9 (33Nasu K. Nishida M. Ueda T. Takai N. Bing S. Narahara H. Miyakawa I. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2005; 11: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine exhibiting numerous functions, which include the regulation of proliferation and differentiation in a variety of cells (34Kishimoto T. Blood. 1989; 74: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Van Snick J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 253-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hirono T. Chem.

It has been demonstrated that the major signal transduction pathways induced by IL-6 involve p38 (38Zauberman A. Zipori D. Krupsky M. Ben-Levy R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3886-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has also been postulated that IL-6-induced signal transduction pathways lead to apoptosis of 1A-9-M cells (39Oritani K. Tomiyama Y. Kincade P.W. Aoyama K. Yokota T. Matsumura I. Kanakura Y. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Matsuzawa Y. Blood. 1999; 93: 1346-1354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that the Src family of kinases also likely regulate p38-mediated IL-6 production following hypoxia in Kupffer cells (40Thobe B.M. Frink M. Choudhry M.A. Schwacha M.G. Bland K.I. Chaudry I.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C476-C482Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recently, evidence has accumulated that indicates that Na+/ K+-ATPase can function as a transmembrane signal transducing complex (i.e. signalosome) (1Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2440-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 41Xie Z. Askari A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2434-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Cardiotonic steroids, including MBG and ouabain, another Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor, can increase intracellular Ca2+, increase reactive oxygen species production, and activate Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, and NFκB pathways (31Schoner W. Scheiner-Bobis G. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: C509-C536Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Thus, cardiotonic steroids can modify a number of cellular functions, such as cellular proliferation, via their effects on Na+/K+-ATPase in addition to their known Na+/K+-ATPase-dependent and -independent cardiovascular effects. However, very little is known about MBG-mediated Na+/K+-ATPase intracellular signaling effects on CTB function. Therefore, we examined the effects of MBG on Jnk, p38, and Src phosphorylation, the early apoptosis markers caspases 9 and 3/7, and annexin-V staining to determine whether MBG causes apoptotic signaling in CTB cells. In addition, we examined IL-6 secretion in response to MBG and determined whether apoptosis and IL-6 secretion could be prevented by the inhibition of p38 and Jnk. We determined that the pro-apoptotic effect of MBG and ouabain on CTB cell function was mediated by Jnk, p38, and Src pathways and by the stimulation of IL-6 production. The similarity of the effects of MBG and ouabain on CTB apoptosis suggests a common pathway and that Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition may play a role. Cell Culture—The human extravillous CTB cell line SGHPL-4 utilized in these studies was derived from first trimester chronic villous tissue (41Xie Z. Askari A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2434-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Dr. Guy Whitley (St. George's Hospital Medical School, London, UK). These cells are well characterized and share many characteristics with isolated primary cells, including the expression of cytokeratin-7, HLA class I antigen, HLA-G, BC-1, CD9, human chorionic gonadotropin, and human placental lactogen (42Choy M.Y. Manyonda I.T. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 13: 2941-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 43Choy M.Y. Whitley G.S. Manyonda I.T.

SGHPL-4 cells were cultured in Ham's F-10 nutrient mix supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and 2 mm l-glutamine (Sigma). Cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 99% humidity (Fisher, Isotemp CO2 incubator). Effect of MBG and Ouabain on Jnk, p38, and Src Phosphorylation—MBG (99.5% purity) was purified from parotid glands of Bufo marinus toads as reported previously (46Bagrov A.Y. Roukoyathina N.I. Pinaev A.G. Dmitrieva R.I. Fedorova O.V. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 274: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The effect of MBG on Jnk, p38, and Src phosphorylation was evaluated by the cellular activation of signaling ELISA (CASE) kit (SuperArray) (47Versteeg H.H. Nijhuis E. van den Brink G.R. Evertzen M. Pynaert G.N. van Deventer S.J. Coffer P.J. Peppelenbosch M.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The kit includes a complete antibody-based detection system for colorimetric quantification of the relative amount of phosphorylated protein and total target protein. For the CASE assay, SGHPL-4 cells were seeded into 96-well plates and were stimulated with 10 or 100 nm MBG or ouabain for 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min. Detection of total and phosphorylated protein expression was determined according to the manufacturer's protocol. Effect of MBG and Ouabain on Caspase 9 and Caspase 3/7 Activity—The Apo-ONE homogeneous caspase 9 and caspase 3/7 assays were performed in 96-well formats after treatment of the cells with 10 nm MBG or 10 nm ouabain for 2, 4, or 6 h. One hundred μl of Apo-ONE caspase 9 or caspase 3/7 (Promega) reagent was added to each well. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, the luminescence was measured by a luminometer (Fluoroskan Ascent FL, Thermo Labsystems) for the evaluation of caspase 9 and 3/7 activity as described previously (30Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar, 32Kawazoe N.

J. Biomol. Screen. 2002; 7: 223-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Annexin-V Staining—Annexin-V is a phospholipid-binding protein with a high affinity for phosphatidylserine. During apoptosis, phosphatidylserine translocates to the outer surface of apoptotic cells. Detection of cell-surface phosphatidylserine with annexin-V thus serves as a marker for apoptotic cells (49van Engeland M. Ramaekers F.C. Schutte B. Reutelingsperger C.P. Cytometry. 1996; 24: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). CTB cells were seeded on coverslips in a 6-well culture plate and allowed to adhere overnight. CTB cells were stimulated with 10 or 100 nm MBG or ouabain for 24 h. Some cells were pretreated for 2 h with p38 (SB 202190, Sigma) or Jnk (SP 600125, Invitrogen) inhibitors before treatment with 10 and 100 nm MBG or ouabain for 24 h. Coverslips were removed and placed in a new 6-well plate with cold incubation buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2). Coverslips containing cells were gently washed three times for 5 min with incubation buffer. Cells were then incubated for 30 min in 1:50 dilution of biotinylated annexin-V (Roche Applied Science) in incubation buffer. After incubation, cells were gently washed three times for 10 min in incubation buffer and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed three times for 5 min in PBS and incubated with 1:200 dilution of Cy3-labeled streptavidin (GE Healthcare) (diluted in PBS) for 30–60 min at room temperature. After incubation, cells were washed three times for 10 min with PBS and mounted by coverslips onto microscope slides along with the nuclei marker 4′,6′ diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen). Cells were visualized using an Olympus FluoView FV 300 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Cytokine Antibody Array Assay—The cytokine antibody array (Panomics) is based on the sandwich ELISA method for detecting protein (50Crowther J.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 42: 1-218PubMed Google Scholar). CTB cells were treated with 10 and 100 nm MBG or ouabain in serum-free medium. After 24 h treatment, media were collected from the flasks seeded with CTB cells. Cells treated with DMSO were used as controls. The samples were collected from cells treated with DMSO, 10 and 100 nm MBG or ouabain and incubated with the array membrane containing biotin-labeled detection antibodies. Antibody-protein complexes on the array were visualized using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and chemiluminescent signals were detected using x-ray film. Enzyme Immunometric Assay of IL-6—IL-6 concentrations in the serum-free medium of CTB cells after treatment with 10 and 100 nm MBG or ouabain were determined by the human IL-6 TiterZyme enzyme immunometric assay (EIA) kit (Assay Designs) (51Chard I.T. An Introduction to Radioimmunoassay & Related Technology. 4th Ed. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1990: 131Google Scholar, 52Tijssen P. Burdon R.H. van Knippenberg P.H. Practice & Theory of Enzyme Immunoassays. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1985: 331Google Scholar). The kit uses a monoclonal antibody to human IL-6 immobilized on a microtiter plate to bind the human IL-6 in the standards or sample. CTB cells were treated with 10 and 100 nm MBG or ouabain in serum-free medium. After 24 h of treatment, media were collected from the flasks seeded with CTB cells. Cells treated with DMSO were used as controls. Some cells were pretreated for 2 h with p38 (SB 202190, Sigma) or Jnk (SP 600125, Invitrogen) inhibitors before treatment with 10 and 100 nm MBG or ouabain for 24 h. All of the samples were collected from the flasks after treatment for determination of IL-6 concentration. After a short incubation, the excess sample or standard was washed out, and an antibody to human IL-6 was added. After a short incubation, the excess antibody was washed out, and donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added. After a short incubation, the enzyme reaction was stopped, and the color generated was read at 450 nm. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Data from MBG-treated and/or ouabain-treated groups were compared with vehicle (DMSO)-treated groups, and statistical comparison for multiple determinations was performed using a one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post hoc t test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. MBG and Ouabain Increased Phosphorylation of Jnk, p38, and Src—Both 10 and 100 nm MBG and ouabain caused a significant increase in the ratio of phosphorylated Jnk to total Jnk in CTB cells compared with controls (50Crowther J.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 42: 1-218PubMed Google Scholar, 48Kavinen J. Hurkainen P. Gopalakrishnan S. Burns D. Warrior U. Hemmila I. J. Biomol.

Similarly, both 10 and 100 nm MBG and ouabain significantly increased the ratio of phosphorylated p38 to total p38 in CTB cells compared with controls (62, 58, and 60% increase at 10, 30, and 60 min, respectively, after MBG treatment and 57, 58, and 60% increase at 10, 30, and 60 min, respectively after ouabain treatment; p < 0.001 for each) (Fig. 2, A and B). Both 10 and 100 nm MBG and ouabain significantly increased the ratio of phosphorylated Src to total Src in CTB cells compared with controls (43, 42, and 45% increase at 10, 30, and 60 min, respectively, after MBG treatment and 50, 48, and 52% increase at 10, 30, and 60 min, respectively, after ouabain treatment; p < 0.001 for each) (Fig. 3, A and B). Ratios of phosphoprotein to total protein at 2- and 4-h time points were not statistically different compared with 1 h for all measures (data not shown). MBG and ouabain had no effect on total Jnk, p38, and Src expression demonstrating that the changes in the ratio were because of increased phosphorylation.FIGURE 2Increased p38 phosphorylation by MBG and ouabain. CTB cells were treated with 10 or 100 nm MBG (A) and 10 or 100 nm ouabain (B) for 10, 30 or 60 min, and p38 phosphorylation was measured directly by the CASE kit. p38 phosphorylation was increased significantly in MBG-treated and ouabain-treated cells when compared with DMSO (vehicle)-treated cells (*, p < 0.001, basal versus both 10 and 100 nm MBG- and ouabain-treated cells for 10, 30, or 60 min).

https://openalex.org/W2028885301,"Failure of axons to regenerate following acute or chronic neuronal injury is attributed to both the inhibitory glial environment and deficient intrinsic ability to re-grow. However, the underlying mechanisms of the latter remain unclear. In this study, we have investigated the role of the mammalian homologue of aspergillus nidulans NudE, Ndel1, emergently viewed as an integrator of the cytoskeleton, in axon regeneration. Ndel1 was synthesized de novo and upregulated in crushed and transected sciatic nerve axons, and, upon injury, was strongly associated with neuronal form of the intermediate filament (IF) Vimentin while dissociating from the mature neuronal IF (Neurofilament) light chain NF-L. Consistent with a role for Ndel1 in the conditioning lesion-induced neurite outgrowth of Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) neurons, the long lasting in vivo formation of the neuronal Ndel1/Vimentin complex was associated with robust axon regeneration. Furthermore, local silencing of Ndel1 in transected axons by siRNA severely reduced the extent of regeneration in vivo. Thus, Ndel1 promotes axonal regeneration; activating this endogenous repair mechanism may enhance neuroregeneration during acute and chronic axonal degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1988786884,"Sorting signals for apically destined proteins are highly diverse and can be present within the luminal, membrane-associated, and cytoplasmic domains of these proteins. A subset of apical proteins partition into detergent-resistant membranes, and the association of these proteins with glycolipid-enriched microdomains or lipid rafts may be important for their proper targeting. Recently, we observed that raft-associated and raft-independent apical proteins take different routes to the apical surface of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (Cresawn, K. O., Potter, B. A., Oztan, A., Guerriero, C. J., Ihrke, G., Goldenring, J. R., Apodaca, G., and Weisz, O. A. (2007) <i>EMBO J.</i> 26, 3737–3748). Here we reconstituted <i>in vitro</i> the export of raft-associated and raft-independent markers staged intracellularly at 19 °C. Surprisingly, whereas release of the raft-associated protein influenza hemagglutinin was dependent on the addition of an ATP-regenerating system and cytosol, release of a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged raft-independent protein (the 75-kDa neurotrophin receptor; YFP-p75) was efficient even in the absence of these constituents. Subsequent studies suggested that YFP-p75 is released from the <i>trans</i>-Golgi network in fragile tubules that do not withstand isolation procedures. Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that hemagglutinin and YFP-p75 segregate into distinct subdomains of the Golgi complex at 19 °C. Our data suggest that raft-associated and raft-independent proteins accumulate at distinct intracellular sites upon low temperature staging, and that upon warming, they exit these compartments in transport carriers that have very different membrane characteristics and morphologies."
https://openalex.org/W1993091800,"In this report, we demonstrate that H-NS is essential for establishing the Mg(2+)-responsive transcriptional regulation of the PhoP regulon in Salmonella. Deletion of this regulatory gene abolished the transcriptional repression of PhoP-activated genes when bacteria were grown in high environmental Mg(2+), thus stimulating expression of phoP and other PhoP regulon genes. In the absence of H-NS, transcriptional activation was PhoP-dependent for those genes only activated by PhoP, but was PhoP-independent for those genes activated by both PhoP and SlyA. The H-NS protein footprints the phoP promoter in a sequence located upstream of the PhoP box; mutation of this cis-acting factor abolished transcriptional repression of the phoP gene equivalent to the phenotype exhibited in the hns mutant. Further results showed that H-NS gel shifts other PhoP regulon promoters, indicating that a PhoP-activated gene would be transcriptionally repressed via direct H-NS binding and inhibition of its activator PhoP. Furthermore, H-NS footprints a newly identified SlyA box and the reverse PhoP box in the pagC promoter, suggesting that both SlyA and PhoP compete with this regulatory protein. Therefore, H-NS should pair with SlyA and PhoP to establish a forward regulatory loop to regulate expression of pagC, and perhaps other PhoP- and SlyA-dependent genes."
https://openalex.org/W2013666033,"The molecular mechanisms regulating the expansion of the hematopoietic system including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the fetal liver during embryonic development are largely unknown. The LIM-homeobox gene Lhx2 is a candidate regulator of fetal hematopoiesis since it is expressed in the fetal liver and Lhx2−/− mice die in utero due to severe anemia. Moreover, expression of Lhx2 in embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived embryoid bodies (EBs) can lead to the generation of HSC-like cell lines. To further define the role of this transcription factor in hematopoietic regulation, we generated ES cell lines that enabled tet-inducible expression of Lhx2. Using this approach we observed that Lhx2 expression synergises with specific signalling pathways, resulting in increased frequency of colony forming cells in developing EB cells. The increase in growth factor-responsive progenitor cells directly correlates to the efficiency in generating HSC-like cell lines, suggesting that Lhx2 expression induce self-renewal of a distinct multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cell in EBs. Signalling via the c-kit tyrosine kinase receptor and the gp130 signal transducer by IL-6 is necessary and sufficient for the Lhx2 induced self-renewal. While inducing self-renewal of multipotential progenitor cells, expression of Lhx2 inhibited proliferation of primitive erythroid precursor cells and interfered with early ES cell commitment, indicating striking lineage specificity of this effect."
https://openalex.org/W2051896494,"The lysosomal ABC transporter associated with antigen processing-like (TAPL, ABCB9) acts as an ATP-dependent polypeptide transporter with broad length selectivity. To characterize in detail its substrate specificity, a procedure for functional reconstitution of human TAPL was developed. By intensive screening of detergents, ideal solubilization conditions were evolved with respect to efficiency, long term stability, and functionality of TAPL. TAPL was isolated in a two-step procedure with high purity and, subsequently, reconstituted into proteoliposomes. The peptide transport activity of reconstituted TAPL strongly depends on the lipid composition. With the help of combinatorial peptide libraries, the key positions of the peptides were localized to the N- and C-terminal residues with respect to peptide transport. At both ends, TAPL favors positively charged, aromatic, or hydrophobic residues and disfavors negatively charged residues as well as asparagine and methionine. Besides specific interactions of both terminal residues, electrostatic interactions are important, since peptides with positive net charge are more efficiently transported than negatively charged ones."
https://openalex.org/W2033707954,"Robustness, a long-recognized property of living systems, allows function in the face of uncertainty while fragility, i.e., extreme sensitivity, can potentially lead to catastrophic failure following seemingly innocuous perturbations. Carlson and Doyle hypothesized that highly-evolved networks, e.g., those involved in cell-cycle regulation, can be resistant to some perturbations while highly sensitive to others. The ""robust yet fragile"" duality of networks has been termed Highly Optimized Tolerance (HOT) and has been the basis of new lines of inquiry in computational and experimental biology. In this study, we tested the working hypothesis that cell-cycle control architectures obey the HOT paradigm. Three cell-cycle models were analyzed using monte-carlo sensitivity analysis. Overall state sensitivity coefficients, which quantify the robustness or fragility of a given mechanism, were calculated using a monte-carlo strategy with three different numerical techniques along with multiple parameter perturbation strategies to control for possible numerical and sampling artifacts. Approximately 65% of the mechanisms in the G1/S restriction point were responsible for 95% of the sensitivity, conversely, the G2-DNA damage checkpoint showed a much stronger dependence on a few mechanisms; approximately 32% or 13 of 40 mechanisms accounted for 95% of the sensitivity. Our analysis predicted that CDC25 and cyclin E mechanisms were strongly implicated in G1/S malfunctions, while fragility in the G2/M checkpoint was predicted to be associated with the regulation of the cyclin B-CDK1 complex. Analysis of a third model containing both G1/S and G2/M checkpoint logic, predicted in addition to mechanisms already mentioned, that translation and programmed proteolysis were also key fragile subsystems. Comparison of the predicted fragile mechanisms with literature and current preclinical and clinical trials suggested a strong correlation between efficacy and fragility. Thus, when taken together, these results support the working hypothesis that cell-cycle control architectures are HOT networks and establish the mathematical estimation and subsequent therapeutic exploitation of fragile mechanisms as a novel strategy for anti-cancer lead generation."
