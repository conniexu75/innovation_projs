https://openalex.org/W2892072481,"The protective role of exogenously applied kinetin (10 μM KN, a cytokinin) against the adverse effects caused by NaCl-induced (150 mM) stress in Solanum lycopersicum was investigated. Application of KN significantly enhanced growth and biomass production of normally grown plants (non-stressed) and also mitigated the adverse effect of NaCl on stressed plants to a considerable extent. Among the examined parameters, chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, photosynthetic parameters, components of the antioxidant system (both enzymatic and non-enzymatic), osmotica accumulation, and mineral uptake exhibited a significant increase following the application of KN. Furthermore, KN application reduced the generation of reactive free radical hydrogen peroxide, coupled with a significant reduction in lipid peroxidation and an increase in membrane stability. The activities of antioxidant enzymes, and glyoxylase system were found to be promoted in plants exposed to NaCl, and the activities were further promoted by KN application, thereby protecting S. lycopersicum plants against NaCl-induced oxidative damage. Further strengthening of the antioxidant system in KN supplied plants was ascribed to regulation of ascorbate-glutathione cycle, phenols and flavonoids in them. The levels of proline and glycine betaine increased considerably in KN-treated plants, thereby maintaining relative water content. Moreover, exogenous KN application reduced the inhibitory effects of NaCl on K+ and Ca2+ uptake, which resulted in a considerable reduction in tissue Na+/K+ ratio."

The recent discoveries of dynamic equilibrium between CSCs and non-CSCs revealed the significance of acquiring CSC-like properties in non-CSCs as an important process in progression of cancer. The mechanism underlying acquisition of CSC-like properties has mainly been investigated in the context of epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Here, we demonstrate the dedifferentiation process may be an alternative mechanism in acquisition of CSC-like properties in human colorectal cancer cells. By exploring the single-cell gene expression analysis of organoids developed from CD44+ CSCs, we identified TWIST1 as a key molecule for maintaining the undifferentiated state of cancer cells. Consistent with the finding, we found that TGF-beta signaling pathway, a regulator of TWIST1, was specifically activated in the undifferentiated CD44+ CSCs in human colorectal cancer using microarray-based gene expression analysis and quantitative pathology imaging system. Furthermore, we showed that external stimulation with TGF-beta and the induction of TWIST1 converted CD44− non-CSCs into the undifferentiated CD44+ CSCs, leading to the significant increment of CSCs in xenograft models. This study strongly suggests dedifferentiation driven by TGF-beta signaling enhances stem cell properties in human colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2891474529,"Background Prior studies have reported inconsistencies in the baseline risk profile, comorbidity burden and their association with clinical outcomes in women compared to men. More importantly, there is limited data around the sex differences and how these have changed over time in contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) practice. Methods and results We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to identify all PCI procedures based on ICD-9 procedure codes in the United States between 2004–2014 in adult patients. Descriptive statistics were used to describe sex-based differences in baseline characteristics and comorbidity burden of patients. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to investigate the association between these differences and in-hospital mortality, complications, length of stay and total hospital charges. Among 6,601,526 patients, 66% were men and 33% were women. Women were more likely to be admitted with diagnosis of NSTEMI (non-ST elevation acute myocardial infarction), were on average 5 years older (median age 68 compared to 63) and had higher burden of comorbidity defined by Charlson score ≥3. Women also had higher in-hospital crude mortality (2.0% vs 1.4%) and any complications compared to men (11.1% vs 7.0%). These trends persisted in our adjusted analyses where women had a significant increase in the odds of in-hospital mortality men (OR 1.20 (95% CI 1.16,1.23) and major bleeding (OR 1.81 (95% CI 1.77,1.86). Conclusion In this national unselected contemporary PCI cohort, there are significant sex-based differences in presentation, baseline characteristics and comorbidity burden. These differences do not fully account for the higher in-hospital mortality and procedural complications observed in women."
https://openalex.org/W2890647279,"Peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and polarizes the macrophages into an anti-inflammatory M2 state. Integrins are transmembrane receptors that drive various cellular functions, including monocyte adhesion and foam cell formation. In this study, we first reported that the expression of integrins αV and β5 was up-regulated by PPARγ activation in RAW264.7 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes. Luciferase reporter and ChIP assay revealed that PPARγ directly bound to the potential PPAR-responsive elements sites in the 5′-flanking regions of both murine and human integrin αV and β5 genes, respectively. In addition, we showed that PPARγ augmented the ligation of integrins αV and β5. Knockdown of integrin αVβ5 by siRNA strategy or treatment with cilengitide, a potent inhibitor of integrin αVβ5, attenuated PPARγ-induced expression of Ym1 (chitinase-like protein 3), Arg1 (Arginase1), Fizz1 (resistin-like molecule RELMα), and other M2 marker genes, suggesting that the heterodimers of integrin αVβ5 were involved in PPARγ-induced M2 polarization. In conclusion, these results provided novel evidence that PPARγ-mediated gene expression and the ensuing ligation of integrins αV and β5 are implicated in macrophage M2 polarization."
https://openalex.org/W2889910514,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive histologic subtype of lung cancer, with a strong predilection for early brain metastases. Despite efforts and advances in new therapeutics for SCLC, the prognosis of patients with SCLC with brain metastases is consistently poor. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms of SCLC brain metastasis is important in improving current treatments. In this study, elevated S100A16 levels were associated with SCLC brain metastases, which was a possible secondary event arising from the brain metastatic microenvironment. Using an in vitro cell coculture system, we found that the coculturing of SCLC cells with human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) led to an increased expression of S100A16 in SCLC cells. Conversely, treatment of HBMECs with GW4869, an inhibitor of exosome release, significantly blocked this effect in the cocultured SCLC cells. Alternatively, the results from Western blot analyses and immunofluorescence indicated that the HBMEC exosomes purified by ultracentrifugation also induced the elevation and translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of S100A16 in the recipient SCLC cells. The inhibition experiments demonstrated that elevated S100A16 contributed a benefit of HBMEC exosomes for the survival of the recipient SCLC cells under stress. Moreover, the elevation of S100A16 in SCLC cells prevented the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and enhanced resistance to apoptosis under stressful conditions, which were determined by Annexin V/propidium iodide and JC-1 assay. Further results showed that the S100A16-mediated protective effect was caused by the presence of an important element in Δψm, prohibitin (PHB)-1, a protein in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Conversely, the delivery of PHB-1 siRNAs into S100A16 overexpressing SCLC cells weakened these protective effects. Our findings suggest that elevated S100A16 plays an active role in facilitating the survival of SCLC cells through modulating the mitochondrial function, identifying S100A16 as an important potential target in SCLC brain metastasis.-Xu, Z.-H., Miao, Z.-W., Jiang, Q.-Z., Gan, D.-X., Wei, X.-G., Xue, X.-Z., Li, J.-Q., Zheng, F., Qin, X.-X., Fang, W.-G., Chen, Y.-H., Li.

https://openalex.org/W2890622265,"The gut microbiome supplies essential metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids to skeletal muscle mitochondria, and the composition and activity of the microbiota is in turn affected by muscle fitness. To further our understanding of the complex interactions between the gut microbiome and muscle, we examined the effect of microbiota-derived phenolic metabolites on the ability of human muscle cells to take up and metabolize glucose. As a model, we used the differentiated human skeletal muscle myoblast line, LHCN-M2, which expresses typical muscle phenotypic markers. We initially tested a selected panel of parent phenolic compounds and microbial metabolites, and their respective phenolic conjugates, as found in blood. Several of the tested compounds increased glucose uptake and metabolism, notably in high glucose- and insulin-treated myotubes. One of the most effective was isovanillic acid 3 -O-sulfate (IVAS), a metabolite from the microbiome found in the blood, primarily derived from consumed cyanidin 3 -O-glucoside, a major compound in berry fruits. IVAS stimulated a dose-dependent increase in glucose transport through glucose transporter GLUT4- and PI3K-dependent mechanisms. IVAS also up-regulated GLUT1, GLUT4, and PI3K p85α protein, and increased phosphorylation of Akt. The stimulation of glucose uptake and metabolism by a unique microbiome metabolite provides a novel link among diet, gut microbiota, and skeletal muscle energy source utilization.-Houghton, M.

https://openalex.org/W2891914450,"The use of social network sites (SNSs) has grown dramatically. Numerous studies have shown that SNS users may suffer from excessive use, associated with addictive-like symptoms. With a focus on the popular SNS Facebook (FB), our aims in the current study were twofold: First, to explore the heterogeneity of FB usage and determine which kind of FB activity predicts problematic usage; second, to test whether specific impulsivity facets predict problematic use of FB. To this end, a sample of FB users (N = 676) completed an online survey assessing usage preferences (e.g., types of activities performed), symptoms of problematic FB use and impulsivity traits. Results indicated that specific usage preferences (updating one's status, gaming via FB, and using notifications) and impulsive traits (positive and negative urgency, lack of perseverance) are associated to problematic FB use. This study underscores that labels such as FB ""addiction"" are misleading and that focusing on the actual activities performed on SNSs is crucial when considering dysfunctional usage. Furthermore, this study clarified the role of impulsivity in problematic FB use by building on a theoretically driven model of impulsivity that assumes its multidimensional nature. The current findings have identifiable theoretical and public health implications."
https://openalex.org/W2891322638,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a major cause of death worldwide. As metastatic disease is primarily responsible for the poor clinical outcome of NSCLC, it is important to understand the process, and its underlying molecular mechanism as well, via which NSCLC cells disseminate. In this study, we identified a new competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), namely, the MYEOV transcript, and found that it is upregulated in NSCLC and associated with a poor prognosis of the disease. We further uncovered that the MYEOV ceRNA plays a critical role in the invasion and metastasis of NSCLC cells. Intriguingly, the MYEOV ceRNA exerted its pro-metastatic function independent of its protein-coding capacity, but in a miR-30c-2-3p binding-dependent manner. Further experiments demonstrated that the MYEOV ceRNA sequestered miR-30c-2-3p from binding its targets TGFBR2 and USP15 mRNAs, which in turn leading to constitutive activation of TGF-β signaling and tumor progression in NSCLC. By identifying a new layer of regulatory modality for TGF-β signaling, our findings extend the current understanding on the molecular mechanism mediating NSCLC progression and highlight a potential role of MYEOV transcript to serve as the therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2891367313,"Hyperthermophilic archaea contain a hydrogen gas–evolving,respiratory membrane–bound NiFe-hydrogenase (MBH) that is very closely related to the aerobic respiratory complex I. During growth on elemental sulfur (S°), these microorganisms also produce a homologous membrane-bound complex (MBX), which generates H2S. MBX evolutionarily links MBH to complex I, but its catalytic function is unknown. Herein, we show that MBX reduces the sulfane sulfur of polysulfides by using ferredoxin (Fd) as the electron donor, and we rename it membrane-bound sulfane reductase (MBS). Two forms of affinity-tagged MBS were purified from genetically engineered Pyrococcus furiosus (a hyperthermophilic archaea species): the 13-subunit holoenzyme (S-MBS) and a cytoplasmic 4-subunit catalytic subcomplex (C-MBS). S-MBS and C-MBS reduced dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) with comparable Km (∼490 μm) and Vmax values (12 μmol/min/mg). The MBS catalytic subunit (MbsL), but not that of complex I (NuoD), retains two of four NiFe-coordinating cysteine residues of MBH. However, these cysteine residues were not involved in MBS catalysis because a mutant P. furiosus strain (MbsLC85A/C385A) grew normally with S°. The products of the DMTS reduction and properties of polysulfides indicated that in the physiological reaction, MBS uses Fd (Eo′ = −480 mV) to reduce sulfane sulfur (Eo′ −260 mV) and cleave organic (RSnR, n ≥ 3) and anionic polysulfides (Sn2−, n ≥ 4) but that it does not produce H2S. Based on homology to MBH, MBS also creates an ion gradient for ATP synthesis. This work establishes the electrochemical reaction catalyzed by MBS that is intermediate in the evolution from proton- to quinone-reducing respiratory complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2891237404,"Pulmonary vascular remodeling of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by an inappropriate increase of vascular cells. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a type I single-pass transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily and is involved in a broad range of hyperproliferative diseases. RAGE is also implicated in the etiology of PAH and is overexpressed in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) in patients with PAH. We examined the role of RAGE in the inappropriate increase of PASMCs in patients with PAH.PASMCs were obtained from 12 patients with PAH including 9 patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and 3 patients with heritable PAH (HPAH) (2 patients with BMPR2 mutation and one patient with SMAD9 mutation) who underwent lung transplantation. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining revealed that RAGE and S100A8 and A9, ligands of RAGE, were overexpressed in IPAH and HPAH-PASMCs in the absence of any external growth stimulus. PDGF-BB (10 ng/mL) up-regulated the expression of RAGE in IPAH and HPAH-PASMCs. PAH-PASMCs are hyperplastic in the absence of any external growth stimulus as assessed by 3H-thymidine incorporation. This result indicates overgrowth characterized by continued growth under a condition of no growth stimulation in PAH-PASMCs. PDGF-BB stimulation caused a higher growth rate of PAH-PASMCs than that of non-PAH-PASMCs. AS-1, an inhibitor of TIR domain-mediated RAGE signaling, significantly inhibited overgrowth characterized by continued growth under a condition of no growth stimulation in IPAH and HPAH-PASMCs (P<0.0001). Furthermore, AS-1 significantly inhibited PDGF-stimulated proliferation of IPAH and HPAH-PASMCs (P<0.0001).RAGE plays a crucial role in the inappropriate increase of PAH-PASMCs. Inhibition of RAGE signaling may be a new therapeutic strategy for PAH."
https://openalex.org/W2889957013,"Schadenfreude is a social emotion that describes one's happiness at the misfortune of others. Because people experience schadenfreude to different extents, it can also be considered a trait. The present research aimed to develop a trait measure of schadenfreude and investigate the relationship between schadenfreude and political downfalls. We developed an item pool and used exploratory (Study 1) and confirmatory (Study 2) factor analyses to establish a 12-item, two-factor schadenfreude measure: benign and malicious. We also assessed its test-retest reliability (Study 3) and convergent validity with related measures (Study 4). Findings supported a two-factor schadenfreude measure that produced valid and reliable scores (Studies 1-4). In an experiment, we found a positive correlation between episodic-but not trait-schadenfreude on spreading news of a politician's downfall (Study 5). Using a 3 (Political affiliation: Democrat, Republican, or other) × 3 (Manipulated condition: Democrat, Republican, or CEO) design, we examined the extent to which participants' schadenfreude predicted their intentions and choices to share an embarrassing news story about a politician or CEO via social media. Schadenfreude can be assessed as a reliable trait-one that may help us predict why some people intend to spread news of embarrassing political failures."
https://openalex.org/W2890695242,"Hypoxia plays an important role in the development of renal fibrosis. G2/M arrest in renal tubular cells is an important pathway in the development of chronic kidney disease. It is unknown whether hypoxia leads to renal fibrosis via the regulation of G2/M arrest in renal tubular epithelial cells. For the first time, to our knowledge, we showed that hypoxia induces G2/M arrest in renal tubular cells leading to renal fibrosis, and microRNAs are involved in this regulation. We compared microRNA expression between hypoxia and normoxia in HK2 cells and found microRNA (miR)-493 to be highly expressed at 24 and 48 h after hypoxia. The overexpression of miR-493 reduced the expression of the cell cycle regulator, Stathmin (STMN)-1, and increased the percentage of G2/M phase cells and profibrotic factors in HK2 cells. Targeting STMN-1 with short hairpin RNA produced an effect similar to that of miR-493 overexpression. On contrast, the miR-493 inhibitor reversed these effects in vitro. Consistent with these results, miR-493 sponge adeno-associated virus reduced the expression of profibrotic factors and increased STMN-1 in vivo. In summary, these results suggest that the miR-493-STMN-1 pathway contributes to hypoxia-induced tubular epithelial cell G2/M arrest and renal fibrosis. Abrogating G2/M arrest and blocking the miR-493-STMN-1 pathway will provide further insight for the development of antifibrosis therapy.-Liu, T., Liu, L., Liu, M., Du, R., Dang, Y., Bai, M., Zhang, L., Ma, F., Yang, X., Ning, X., Sun, S.

https://openalex.org/W2892142080,"Vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) is a pro-proliferative nuclear kinase. Mice engrafted with VRK1-depleted MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells have been shown to develop fewer distal metastases than controls, suggesting VRK1 might play a role in cell migration, invasion, and/or colonization. In work described herein, we investigated the impact of VRK1 overexpression on human mammary epithelial cells. In 2D culture, VRK1 overexpression diminishes cell migration and invasion and impairs the migration-associated processes of cell spreading and cytoskeletal rearrangement. VRK1-overexpressing cells show reduced accumulation of the mesenchymal marker vimentin and increased accumulation of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and claudin-1. VRK1 overexpression also leads to reduced levels of the transcriptional repressors snail, slug, and twist1. Cumulatively, these data indicate that VRK1 overexpression augments the epithelial properties of both MCF10a and MDA-MB-231 cells. We further studied the impact of VRK1 on the epithelial properties of MCF10a cells in 3D matrigel culture, in which cells proliferate and form epithelial sheets that mature into hollow spherical acini. VRK1 overexpression significantly accelerates the initial stages of cell proliferation, leading to larger acini that nevertheless differentiate and mature. Our analysis of human tumor tissue microarrays (TMAs) revealed that VRK1 protein levels are higher in lymph node metastases than in patient-matched mammary tumors. Using public databases, we determined that VRK1 is among the top 10% of overexpressed transcripts in multiple subtypes of invasive breast cancer, and that high levels of VRK1 expression are correlated with decreased relapse-free survival. In sum, overexpression of VRK1, by regulating the transcription repressors snail, slug, and twist1, can promote a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in cell culture. VRK1-mediated MET might facilitate the colonization of distal sites by metastatic breast cancer cells, providing some insight into the frequent association of VRK1 overexpression with breast malignancies and the correlation between VRK1 overexpression and poor clinical outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2890026442,"Background Patient-reported satisfaction with inpatient psychiatric services, within the first few days of admission, is related to positive future outcomes. Despite its predictive value, little is known about this initial experience and what underlies these appraisals. The aim of this study was to qualitatively explore the initial experience of being admitted to an inpatient psychiatric ward. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 61 recently admitted patients across five psychiatric hospitals in London, England. Participants were purposively sampled to ensure a mix of experiences including people with high and low satisfaction scores as measured by the Client Assessment of Treatment. Thematic analysis was used to identify, analyse and report patterns within the data, with content analysis applied to determine whether certain themes were more common to either negative or positive appraisals. Results Four broad themes were evident 1) ‘Best place for me right now?’ 2) ‘Different from out in society’ 3) ‘Moving from uncertainty to being informed’ and 4) ‘Relating & Alienating’. Individuals with very positive appraisals spoke most frequently of helpful relationships with both staff and other patients, and feeling cared for. They also spoke of having had previous admissions and the assessment process on entering the ward suggesting that these may be valuable experiences. Conversely, the group with very negative appraisals spoke of relationships that were alienating or where there was a perceived abuse of power. They described restrictions to their freedom, compared hospital to prison and generally had the view that hospital makes you worse. Conclusions The experience of hospital within the first few days of admission determines whether an individual has a positive or negative experience of their inpatient care. Reducing the impact of uncertainty and promoting good relationships may help services to improve the initial experience of hospital admission and ultimately improve future outcomes for patients."
https://openalex.org/W2891486038,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a serious neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired or abnormal social interaction and communication and by restricted and repetitive behaviour. ASD is highly prevalent in Asia, Europe, and the United States, and the frequency of ASD is growing each year. Recent epidemiological studies have indicated that ASD may be caused or triggered by exposure to chemicals in the environment, such as those in the air or water. Thus, toxicological studies are needed to examine chemicals that might be implicated. However, the experimental efficiency of existing experimental models is limited, and many models represent challenges in terms of animal welfare. Thus, alternative ASD animal models are necessary. To address this, we examined the efficacy of the zebrafish embryo/larva as an alternative model of ASD. Specifically, we exposed zebrafish to valproic acid (0, 12.5, 25, 50, or 100 μM), which is a chemical known to induce autism-like effects. We then analysed subsequent developmental, behavioural, and transcriptomic changes. We found that 100 μM and 50 μM valproic acid decreased the hatching rate and locomotor activity of zebrafish embryos/larvae. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant alterations in a number of genes associated with autism, such as adsl, mbd5, shank3, and tsc1b. Additionally, we found changes in gene ontology that were also reported in previous studies. Our findings indicate that zebrafish embryos/larvae and humans with ASD might have common physiological pathways, indicating that this animal model may represent an alternative tool for examining the causes of and potential treatments for this illness."

Host sterile alpha motif– and histidine-aspartate domain–containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) kinetically restricts reverse transcription of primate lentiviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), in nondividing myeloid cells. SAMHD1 enforces this restriction through its dNTP triphosphohydrolase (dNTPase) activity that depletes cellular dNTPs. Some primate lentiviruses, such as HIV-2, SIVsm, and SIVagm, counteract SAMHD1 restriction by using their viral accessory proteins (Vpx or Vpr) that induce the proteosomal degradation of SAMHD1 and increase dNTP levels.

However, whether these viruses also target SAMHD1 is unknown.

Using biochemical and various cell-based assays, we observed that SAMHD1 proteins from the non-primate host species display dGTP-dependent dNTPase activity, but that the non-primate lentiviruses fail to proteosomally degrade the SAMHD1 proteins of their hosts.

Non-primate lentiviruses are considered as the ancestral origin of primate lentiviruses, based on the dUTPase gene encoded in non-primate lentiviruses as well as the higher diversity among FIV strains, compared with HIV-1 M strains (26.Foley B.T.

Some anti–host factor targeting functions (i.e. vif against APOBEC proteins) can be found in both primate and non-primate lentiviruses. However, in general, non-primate lentiviruses encode smaller numbers of accessory genes compared with primate lentiviruses. Importantly, SAMHD1 genes are also found among mammals, including cats, cows, and horses. SAMHD1 proteins of primates (14.Goldstone D.C. Ennis-Adeniran V. Hedden J.J. Groom H.C. Rice G.I.

However, the dNTPase activity of SAMHD1 proteins found in the host species carrying lentiviruses has not been tested. Furthermore, it is unclear whether non-primate SAMHD1 proteins can restrict their own lentiviruses in nondividing cells and whether they are also proteosomally targeted by non-primate lentiviruses. Here, we demonstrate that although the SAMHD1 proteins of the non-primate host species harbor dGTP-activated dNTPase activity, FIV, BIV, and EIAV do not proteosomally degrade their host SAMHD1 proteins. This study demonstrates that the accessory protein–mediated SAMHD1 degradation did not exist among the ancestral non-primate lentiviruses but was established among some primate lentiviruses after lentiviruses spread to primate host species. Although the SAMHD1 genes can be found among mammals, only primate and mouse SAMHD1 proteins were biochemically and structurally investigated for their dGTP-dependent dNTPase activity (14.Goldstone D.C.

As shown in Fig. 1A, feline SAMHD1 (fSAMHD1) (sequence similarity to hSAMHD1: 77.80%) harbors the conserved histidine–aspartic acid (HD) active site for the dNTPase catalytic activity (red) as observed in human SAMHD1 (hSAMHD1). Both hSAMHD1 and fSAMHD1 also display strong sequence similarity at the two allosteric sites (Fig. 1A, A1 for blue and A2 for green) regulated by dGTP/GTP and dNTPs, respectively (29.Hansen E.C. Seamon K.J. Cravens S.L. Stivers J.T. GTP activator and dNTP substrates of HIV-1 restriction factor SAMHD1 generate a long-lived activated state.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

First, we biochemically tested whether fSAMHD1 protein harbors the dGTP-activated dNTPase activity. GST-tagged fSAMHD1 HD domain was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by using GST column chromatography followed by GST-tag removal and gel filtration. We also constructed and purified the catalytically inactive HD dNTPase active site mutant of fSAMHD1 (H206R D207N). Initially, both of the purified WT and HD mutant fSAMHD1 proteins, which showed high purity (Fig. S1), were tested for their dGTP-dependent dNTPase activity by using TLC-based assay (32.Amie S.M. Bambara R.A. Kim B. GTP is the primary activator of the anti-HIV restriction factor SAMHD1.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 (23880768): 25001-2500610.1074/jbc.C113.493619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this assay, [α-32P]dTTP (substrate) was incubated with SAMHD1 proteins in the presence or absence of an activator, dGTP. As shown in Fig. 1B, the 32P-triphosphate product (PPPi) of the radioactive dTTP substrate hydrolysis by hSAMHD1 (H) and fSAMHD1 (F) was detected only when incubated with dGTP, and more than 60% of the initial dTTP substrate was hydrolyzed under the reaction condition. These data suggest that fSAMHD1 requires dGTP for dTTP hydrolysis as observed with hSAMHD1. We additionally confirmed the dNTPase activity of fSAMHD1 by using HPLC-based assay (32.Amie S.M. Bambara R.A. Kim B. GTP is the primary activator of the anti-HIV restriction factor SAMHD1.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 (23880768): 25001-2500610.1074/jbc.C113.493619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this assay, dGTP works both as an activator for the A1 and A2 sites and as a substrate of SAMHD1, and, dG, which is a product of dGTP hydrolysis, was separated from dGTP by HPLC. As shown in Fig. 1C, when dGTP was incubated with (blue line) or without (red line) hSAMHD1, the elevated amount of the dG product was detected only for the incubation with hSAMHD1. dCMP was used as an internal loading control in this assay. When dGTP was incubated with the purified WT (blue line) or HD mutant (red line) fSAMHD1 proteins (Fig. 1D), only WT fSAMHD1 produced the elevated dG product levels. Overall, the data in Fig. 1 demonstrate that fSAMHD1 is a dGTP-dependent dNTPase as observed with hSAMHD1. Next, we tested whether the expression of fSAMHD1 in nondividing cells reduces cellular dNTP concentrations. For this test, we employed SAMHD1 knockout (KO) human monocytic THP-1 cells that we previously established by CRISPR/Cas9 (33.Bonifati S. Daly M.B. St. Gelais C. Kim S.H. Hollenbaugh J.A. Shepard C. Kennedy E.M. Kim D.-H. Schinazi R.F. Kim B. Wu L. SAMHD1 controls cell cycle status, apoptosis and HIV-1 infection in monocytic THP-1 cells.Virology. 2016; 495 (27183329): 92-10010.1016/j.virol.2016.05.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the loss of hSAMHD1 expression in the PMA-mediated differentiated SAMHD1 KO THP-1 cells, compared with the parental WT THP-1 cells. First, we transduced the SAMHD1 KO THP-1 cells with a lentiviral vector co-expressing both HA-tagged fSAMHD1 and mCherry protein. The mCherry-positive cells, which also express fSAMHD1, were then FACS sorted and propagated. Next, we tested the expression of the HA-tagged fSAMHD1 in the propagated mCherry-positive SAMHD1 KO THP-1 cells, after PMA-mediated differentiation (7 days) to nondividing macrophages, by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, the mCherry-positive SAMHD1 KO THP-1 cells (fS) showed fSAMHD1 expression, whereas the same cells transduced with the control vector expressing only mCherry protein (mC) as well as untransduced control KO cells (C) showed no fSAMHD1 expression. Next, we measured the dNTP levels in the differentiated SAMHD1 KO THP-1 cells with or without fSAMHD1 expression. We previously reported that SAMHD1 KO THP-1 cells showed increased cellular dNTP levels, compared with the non-KO parental WT THP-1 cells, after the PMA-mediated differentiation (33.Bonifati S. Daly M.B. St. Gelais C. Kim S.H. Hollenbaugh J.A. Shepard C. Kennedy E.M. Kim D.-H. Schinazi R.F. Kim B. Wu L. SAMHD1 controls cell cycle status, apoptosis and HIV-1 infection in monocytic THP-1 cells.Virology. 2016; 495 (27183329): 92-10010.1016/j.virol.2016.05.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, the differentiated SAMHD1 KO THP-1 cells expressing only mCherry showed higher dATP levels, compared with the differentiated parental WT THP-1 cells. However, this elevated dATP level was reduced by the expression of fSAMHD1 (dATP in Fig. 2B and other three dNTPs in Fig. S2), supporting that fSAMHD1 works as dNTPase in the nondividing cells as predicted by its biochemical dNTPase activity (Fig. 1B). Next, we evaluated the antiviral activity of fSAMHD1 in differentiated/nondividing SAMHD1 KO THP-1 cells. For this test, we compared the transduction efficiency of the FP93-based and VSV-G–pseudotyped FIV vector expressing GFP (34.Poeschla E.M. Wong-Staal F. Looney D.J. Efficient transduction of nondividing human cells by feline immunodeficiency virus lentiviral vectors.Nat. Med. 1998; 4 (9500613): 354-35710.1038/nm0398-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) in the PMA-differentiated SAMHD1 KO THP-1 cells with or without fSAMHD1 expression by FACS analysis. This FIV vector system employs pFP93 packaging plasmid encoding FIV gag, pol, and rev genes, but not vif and tat-like orfA, as well as env. As shown in Fig. 2C, the SAMHD1 KO THP-1 cells showed the increased FIV-GFP vector transduction efficiency, compared with the parental WT THP-1 cells, which is because of the elevated dNTP concentration induced by loss of hSAMHD1 as we reported previously (33.Bonifati S. Daly M.B. St. Gelais C. Kim S.H. Hollenbaugh J.A. Shepard C. Kennedy E.M. Kim D.-H. Schinazi R.F. Kim B. Wu L. SAMHD1 controls cell cycle status, apoptosis and HIV-1 infection in monocytic THP-1 cells.Virology. 2016; 495 (27183329): 92-10010.1016/j.virol.2016.05.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 2C, the differentiated SAMHD1 KO THP-1 cells that express fSAMHD1 displayed reduced transduction efficiency of the FIV-GFP vector, compared with the same SAMHD1 KO cells without fSAMHD1 expression (mCherry protein only). Next, we also tested whether human SAMHD1 can restrict FIV vector in human primary macrophages. For this test, human primary monocyte-derived macrophages from four healthy donors were pretreated with virus-like particles (VLPs) with (+) or without (−) Vpx that degrades hSAMHD1. Indeed, as shown in the insert of Fig. 2D, we confirmed the complete degradation of hSAMHD1 in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages by Vpx. Next, human primary macrophages were transduced with FIV-GFP vector, and the transduction efficiency was determined by FACS analysis for GFP expression. As shown in Fig. 2D, human macrophages treated with Vpx (+) VLPs greatly enhanced the transduction efficiency of FIV-GFP vector, compared with the macrophages treated with Vpx (−) VLPs. This suggests SIV Vpx can render primary human macrophages permissive to FIV replication, most likely because of Vpx-mediated degradation of hSAMHD1. Overall, the data presented in Fig. 2 demonstrate that fSAMHD1 reduces cellular dNTP concentration and restricts FIV in nondividing THP-1 cells as hSAMHD1 restricts HIV-1 in macrophages. We then tested whether FIV is capable of proteosomally degrading fSAMHD1, as HIV-2 and some SIV strains degrade hSAMHD1. For this test, we employed the SAMHD1 degradation assay established previously (18.Spragg C.J. Emerman M.

https://openalex.org/W2890299603,"Viral infections of alfalfa are widespread in major cultivation areas and their impact on alfalfa production may be underestimated. A new viral species, provisionally named alfalfa virus F (AVF), was identified using a virion-associated nucleic acid (VANA) metagenomics-based approach in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) samples collected in Southern France. The nucleotide sequence of the viral genome was determined by de-novo assembly of VANA reads and by 5’/3’ RACE with viral RNA extracted from enriched viral particles or with total RNA, respectively. The virus shares the greatest degree of overall sequence identity (~78%) with Medicago sativa marafivirus 1 (MsMV1) recently deduced from alfalfa transcriptomic data. The tentative nucleotide sequence of the AVF coat protein shares ~83% identity with the corresponding region of MsMV1. A sequence search of the predicted single large ORF encoding a polyprotein of 235kDa in the Pfam database resulted in identification of five domains, characteristic of the genus Marafivirus, family Tymoviridae. The AVF genome also contains a conserved “marafibox”, a 16-nt consensus sequence present in all known marafiviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete nucleotide sequences of AVF and other viruses of the family Tymoviridae grouped AVF in the same cluster with MsMV1. In addition to 5’ and 3’ terminal extensions, the identity of the virus was confirmed by RT-PCRs with primers derived from VANA-contigs, transmission electron microscopy with virus-infected tissues and transient expression of the viral coat protein gene using a heterologous virus-based vector. Based on the criteria demarcating species in the genus Marafivirus that include overall sequence identity less than 80% and coat protein identity less than 90%, we propose that AVF represents a distinct viral species in the genus Marafivirus, family Tymoviridae."
https://openalex.org/W2891225807,"Cases of exertional heat stroke have been reported every year during basic training for Royal Thai Army (RTA) conscripts. Prevention is an important strategy to reduce the incidence of heat-related illnesses. We conducted a study to identify potential indicators for the prevention and monitoring of heat-related illnesses among military conscripts undergoing basic training in Thailand. All newly inducted RTA conscripts in 5 basic training units in 5 regions in Thailand were invited to participate in a prospective cohort study from May 1 to July 9, 2013. The incidence rate of heat-related illnesses and the incidence rate ratio (IRR) based on a Poisson regression model were used to identify the independent factors associated with heat-related illnesses, daily tympanic (body) temperatures higher than 37.5°C, >3% decreases in body weight in one day, and the production of dark brown urine. Eight hundred and nine men aged 21.4 (±1.13) years were enrolled in this study. The prevalence of a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2 was 5.5%. During the study period, 53 subjects (6.6%) representing 3.41/100 person-months (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.55-4.23) developed heat-related illnesses (excluding heat rash), and no subjects experienced heat stroke. The incidence rates of a daily tympanic temperature >37.5°C at least once, body weight loss of >3% per day, and the production of dark brown urine at least once were 8.27/100 person-months (95% CI, 7.69-8.93), 47.91/100 person-months (95% CI, 44.22-51.58), and 682.11/100 person-months (95% CI, 635.49-728.52), respectively. The sole identified independent factor related to the incidence of heat-related illnesses was a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 (adjusted IRR = 2.66, 95% CI, 1.01-7.03). In conclusion, a high BMI was associated with heat-related illnesses among conscripts undergoing basic training in Thailand. Daily monitoring of heat-related illnesses, body temperature, body weight and urine color in each new conscript during basic military training was feasible."
https://openalex.org/W2891550068,"Background The predictive factors of overall survival after hepatectomy for HCC remain controversial and need to be investigated. Methods In total, 535 consecutive HCC patients undergoing resection were included and their clinicopathological data and overall survival were recorded. Both the tumor and adjacent non-tumor (ANT) tissues were subjected to immunohistochemistry analysis for the expression of autophagy-related markers. Results Death was observed for 219 patients, and the cumulative overall survival rates at 1, 3, 5 and 7 years were 91.0%, 72.3%, 58.8%, and 27.7%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, mortality was significantly associated with the following: diminished LC3 expression in both the tumor and ANT tissues, in the HCC tissues alone and in the ANT tissues alone (hazard ratio/95% confidence interval: 6.74/2.052–22.19, 6.70/1.321–33.98 and 2.58/1.499–4.915, respectively); recurrent HCC (5.11/3.136–8.342); HBV infection (2.75/1.574–4.784); cirrhosis (1.78/1.059–2.974); and antiviral therapy (0.42/0.250–0.697). The 5-year overall survival rates were 70.2%, 57.3%, 49.6% and 10.7% for patients with positive LC3 expression in both tissue types, in the HCC tissues alone, in the ANT tissues alone, and in neither tissue type, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rates were 56.7%, 47.3%, 51.2% and 38.7% for patients with HBV-related HCC, cirrhosis, no antiviral therapy, and recurrent HCC, respectively, and these rates were significantly lower than those in their counterparts. Conclusions Patients with recurrent HCC, HBV-related HCC, cirrhosis, and the absence of antiviral therapy showed significantly lower overall survival rates. Furthermore, LC3 expression in both the tumor and liver microenvironments were significantly predictive of overall survival after resection for HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2891717072,"Background The Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT) program in India is one of the largest in the world. It uses outreach workers (ORWs) to facilitate patient uptake of services, however, the challenges faced by the ORWs, and their views about the effectiveness of this program are unknown. Methods The COMmunity-Home Based INDia (COMBIND) Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV study evaluated an integrated mobile health and behavioral intervention to enhance the capacity of ORWs in India. To understand the challenges faced by ORWs, and their perceptions of opportunities for program improvement, four group discussions were conducted among 60 ORW from four districts of Maharashtra, India, as part of the baseline assessment for COMBIND. Data were qualitatively analyzed using a thematic approach. Results Numerous personal-, social-, and structural-level challenges existed for ORW as they engaged with their patients. Personal-level challenges for ORWs included disclosure of their own HIV status and travelling costs for home visits. Personal-level challenges for patients included financial costs of travelling to ART centers, non-adherence to ART, loss of daily wages, non-affordability of infant formula, lack of awareness of the baby’s needs, financial dependence on family, four time points (6weeks, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months) for HIV tests, and need for nevirapine (NVP) prophylaxis. Social-level challenges included lack of motivation by patients and/or health care staff, social stigma, and rude behavior of health care staff and their unwillingness to provide maternity services to women in the PMTCT programme. Structural-level challenges included cultural norms around infant feeding, shortages of HIV testing kits, shortages of antiretroviral drugs and infant NVP prophylaxis, and lack of training/knowledge related to PMTCT infant feeding guidelines by hospital staff. The consensus among ORWs was that there was a critical need for tools and training to improve their capacity to effectively engage with patients, and deliver appropriate care, and for motivation through periodic feedback. Conclusions Given the significant challenges in PMTCT programme implementation reported by ORW, novel strategies to address these challenges are urgently needed to improve patient engagement, and access to and retention in care."
https://openalex.org/W2889565977,"As a result of great diversity in life histories and a large number of described species, taxonomic and phylogenetic uncertainty permeates the entire crustacean order of Isopoda. Large molecular datasets capable of providing sufficiently high phylogenetic resolution, such as mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes), are needed to infer their evolutionary history with confidence, but isopod mitogenomes remain remarkably poorly represented in public databases. We sequenced the complete mitogenome of Cymothoa indica, a species belonging to a family from which no mitochondrial genome was sequenced yet, Cymothoidae. The mitogenome (circular, 14484 bp, A+T = 63.8%) is highly compact, appears to be missing two tRNA genes (trnI and trnE), and exhibits a unique gene order with a large number of rearrangements. High compactness and the existence of palindromes indicate that the mechanism behind these rearrangements might be associated with linearization events in its evolutionary history, similar to those proposed for isopods from the Armadillidium genus (Oniscidea). Isopods might present an important model system to study the proposed discontinuity in the dynamics of mitochondrial genomic architecture evolution. Phylogenetic analyses (Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood) conducted using nucleotide sequences of all mitochondrial genes resolved Oniscidea and Cymothoida suborders as paraphyletic. Cymothoa indica was resolved as a sister group (basal) to all remaining isopods, which challenges the accepted isopod phylogeny, where Cymothoida are the most derived, and Phreatoicidea the most basal isopod group. There is growing evidence that Cymothoida suborder might be split into two evolutionary distant clades, with parasitic species being the most basal split in the Isopoda clade, but a much larger amount of molecular resources carrying a high phylogenetic resolution will be needed to infer the remarkably complex evolutionary history of this group of animals with confidence."
https://openalex.org/W2890245781,"Background The 20% observed mortality within 5 years among survivors of myocardial infarction may be explained in part by non-adherence to the recommended treatment over the long term. Main objective To investigate post-myocardial infarction patients’ adherence to the therapeutic, lifestyle and risk factor control recommendations of the French health authority over 6 years. Materials and methods A cohort of survivors of myocardial infarction established in Tours in 2009 was followed over 6 years. The general practitioner of the patients included in the first 1-year follow-up study was contacted to collect data on treatments, cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle between January and June 2015. Data were described and compared with the recommendations and predictors of achieving all the recommended targets were determined. Results A total of 97 patients (52%) among the 185 patients who underwent a coronary angioplasty for MI were included at baseline. Treatment was adapted by the general practitioner on the advice on the cardiologist for 75% (73/97) patients, by both of them for 12% (12/97) and by the general practitioner alone for 7% (7/97) patients. Among the 97 initial patients, 62 were included in the final analysis at 6 years. Fatal events rate was 5% (5/97) at 1 year and 12% (11/91) at 6 years. Non-fatal events rate was 44% (43/97) at 6 months, 19% (17/91) at 1 year and 29% (18/62) at 6 years. Six years after the myocardial infarction, 6 (10%) patients achieved the recommended targets in terms of prescriptions of treatment, risk factors and lifestyle targets. Exposure to a cardiac rehabilitation program after a myocardial infarction was associated with long-term achievement of optimal therapeutic objectives (OR = 7.31 [95% CI 1.74; 44.88], p<0.002). Conclusion Our data show suboptimal long-term adherence to secondary prevention treatment in this high-risk population of survivors of myocardial infarction, which seems to be improved in patients exposed to a cardiac rehabilitation program."
https://openalex.org/W2890375510,"Introduction The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2106261 in the transcription factor gene ZFHX3 (16q22), a major regulator of inflammation, has been reported linking to atrial fibrillation (AF) by genome-wide association studies. Inflammation is known to be a strong predictor of atrial fibrillation recurrence after ablation, so we examined the association of the ZFHX3 SNP rs2106261 to inflammation marker expression and recurrence after AF ablation. Methods We genotyped ZFHX3 SNP rs2106261 and compared the minor (T) allele frequency between 362 paroxysmal AF (PAF) patients underwent pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) and 627 non-AF controls. We also analyzed associations between ZFHX3 SNP rs2106261 genotype and recurrence rate after pulmonary vein isolation and the inflammation markers. Results The minor (T) allele frequency of the ZFHX3 SNP rs2106261 was significantly higher in AF patients than non-AF controls (odds ratio 1.52, p = 2.2×10−5). Multivariable analysis revealed that the minor allele (T) decreased AF recurrence rate after pulmonary vein isolation (hazard ratio 0.53, p = 0.04). Further, neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratio, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression levels were lower in PAF patients with the ZFHX3 SNP rs2106261 minor allele (TT+TC) than in CC patients (N/L ratio: CC 2.22 ± 0.08, TT+TC 1.98 ± 0.06, p = 0.018; CRP: CC 0.103 ± 0.009 mg/dl, TT+TC 0.076 ±0.007 mg/dl, p = 0.016; IL-6: CC 60.3 ± 3.0 pg/ml, TT+TC 52.8 ± 2.3 pg/ml, p = 0.04). Conclusions The ZFHX3 SNP rs2106261 minor allele is associated with lower AF recurrence rate after pulmonary vein isolation. Low baseline inflammation conferred by this allele may reduce AF recurrence risk."
https://openalex.org/W2890633723,"WW domain binding protein 2 (WBP2), a transcriptional coactivator, plays a vital role in breast tumorigenesis. It positively regulates estrogen receptor, Hippo, and Wnt pathways, which subsequently enhance the transcription of downstream target genes contributing to cancer. Understanding the regulation of the expression and activity of WBP2 oncoprotein has implication in cancer therapy. We have previously reported that WBP2 is regulated at the post-translational and post-transcriptional levels. However, its regulation at the transcriptional level is not known. In this study, the minimal promoter region of WBP2 that is critical for its transcription was identified. The E-box motif in the WBP2 promoter was demonstrated to be essential for its transcription. The E-box binding protein upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF-1) was discovered to be a key transcription factor for WBP2 by yeast one-hybrid analysis and was validated through reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and tandem mass spectrometry, which also suggested that USF-1 acts by regulating a network of genes, in addition to WBP2, associated with cell movement, proliferation, cell-cycle, and survival cellular processes. USF-1 is overexpressed in majority of the breast cancer cell lines and tissues tested, and has profound effects on cancer cell proliferation. USF-1-mediated transcription of WBP2 was demonstrated to be inducible by insulin, which led to AKT-mediated phosphorylation of USF-1 that modulated its ability to bind to the WBP2 promoter and activate its transcription. This study sheds new light onto the regulation of the WBP2 oncogene at the transcriptional level by a novel oncogenic transcription factor, USF-1. USF-1 is a potential drug target for treatment of WBP2-positive breast cancer.-Ramos, A., Miow, Q. H., Liang, X., Lin, Q. S., Putti, T. C., Lim, Y. P.

To understand the underlying basis of this differential response, we have investigated aerobic expression of the Rv3134c-devR-devS operon using M. tuberculosis H37Ra and H37Rv devR overexpression strains, designated as LIX48 and LIX50, respectively.

To ascertain the involvement of PhoP response regulator, also known to co-regulate a subset of DevR regulon genes, we complemented the naturally occurring mutant phoPRa gene of LIX48 with the WT phoPRv gene. PhoPRv dampened the induced expression of the DevR regulon by >70–80%, implicating PhoP in the negative regulation of devR expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed phosphorylation-independent binding of PhoPRv to the Rv3134c promoter and further revealed that DevR and PhoPRv proteins exhibit differential DNA binding properties to the target DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2892326314,"The tradeoff between knowing when to seek greater rewards (exploration), and knowing when to settle (exploitation), is critical to success. One dispositional factor that may modulate this tradeoff is “grit.” Gritty individuals tend to persist in the face of difficulty and consequently experience greater life success. It is possible that they may also experience a greater tendency to explore in a reward task. However, although most exploration/exploitation tasks manipulate beliefs about the presence/magnitude of rewards in the environment, the belief of one’s ability to actually achieve a reward is also critical. As such, we investigated whether individuals higher in grit were more likely to explore, and how beliefs about the magnitude/presence of rewards, and the perceived ability to achieve a reward, modulated their exploration tendencies. Over two experiments, participants completed 4 different exploration/persistence tasks: two that tapped into participant beliefs about the presence/magnitude of rewards, and two that tapped into participant beliefs about their ability to achieve a reward. Participants also completed measures of dispositional grit (Experiment 1a and 1b), conscientiousness (Experiment 1b), and working memory (Experiment 1a and 1b). In both experiments, we found a relationship between the two “belief of rewards” tasks, as well as between the two “belief of ability” tasks, but performance was unrelated across the two types of task. We also found that dispositional grit was strongly associated with greater exploration, but only on the “belief of ability” tasks. Finally, in Experiment 1b we showed that conscientiousness better predicted exploration on the “belief of ability” tasks than grit, suggesting that it is not grittiness per se that is associated with exploration. Overall, our findings showed that individuals high in grit/conscientiousness are more likely to explore, but only when there is a known reward available that they believe they have the ability to achieve."

All participants underwent a clinical examination and a plethysmography measurement. Z-scores for some spirometric data [FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC and forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of FVC (FEF25-75%)] were calculated.

https://openalex.org/W2889624616,"Background Although urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) has emerged as a promising biomarker for the early detection of kidney injury, previous studies of adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery have reported only moderate discrimination. The age, creatinine, and ejection fraction (ACEF) score is a preoperative validated risk model with satisfactory accuracy for predicting AKI following cardiac surgery. It remains unknown whether combining preoperative risk assessment through ACEF scores followed by urinary NGAL test in a population of high-risk individuals is an optimal approach with improved predictive performance. Material and methods A total of 177 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac surgery were enrolled. Clinical characteristics, prognostic model scores, and outcomes were assessed. Urinary NGAL were examined within 6 hours after cardiac surgery. Patients were stratified according to preoperative ACEF scores, and comparisons were made using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) for the prediction of AKI. Results A total of 45.8% (81/177) of the patients had AKI. As expected, patients with ACEF scores ≥ 1.1 were older and more likely to have class III or IV heart failure. They were also more likely to have diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, and peripheral arterial disease. Urinary NGAL alone moderately predicted AKI, with an AUROC of 0.732. Risk stratification by ACEF scores ≥ 1.1 substantially improved the AUROC of urinary NGAL to 0.873 (95% confidence interval, 0.784–0.961; P < .001). Conclusions Risk stratification by preoperative ACEF scores ≥ 1.1, followed by postoperative urinary NGAL, provides more satisfactory risk discrimination than does urinary NGAL alone for the early detection of AKI after cardiac surgery. Future studies should investigate whether this strategy could improve the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of care in patients undergoing cardiac surgery."

Emerging evidence from ZnT8 biochemistry, animal models, and human genetics has coalesced to suggest a causal relationship linking the gain-of-function Arg-235 variant and increased T2D risk, supporting the case for ZnT8 inhibition as a potential antidiabetogenic strategy (16.Pearson E.

Two alternative approaches may be used to down-regulate ZnT8 activity in β-cells: inhibiting zinc transport or reducing ZnT8 expression. The mechanism driving zinc transport is conserved from bacteria to humans (27.Ohana E. Hoch E. Keasar C. Kambe T. Yifrach O. Hershfinkel M. Sekler I. Identification of the Zn2+ binding site and mode of operation of a mammalian Zn2+ transporter.J. Biol.

Structure of the zinc transporter YiiP.Science. 2007; 317 (17717154): 1746-174810.1126/science.1143748Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), zinc transport is susceptible to allosteric regulation by zinc binding to a cytosolic C-terminal domain (CTD) (30.Lu M. Chai J. Fu D. Structural basis for autoregulation of the zinc transporter YiiP.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16 (19749753): 1063-106710.1038/nsmb.1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Likewise, allostery may be targeted for ZnT8 inhibition using mAb to trap ZnT8 in a fixed conformation, but a proof-of-principle allosteric inhibitor is still lacking. Furthermore, functional regulation of ZnT8 expression in β-cells has yet to be investigated due to a lack of ZnT8-specific reagents for tracking the cellular ZnT8 level over a heterogeneous background. Discovering specific and high-affinity mAbs would permit testing the allosteric inhibition hypothesis while developing assays to quantify the cellular ZnT8 level. In the present work, we identified two mAbs (mAb20 and mAb39) through a multitier screening against purified human ZnT8 in its native conformations. Detailed mAb characterization revealed distinct binding properties and specificities with a common ability to stabilize ZnT8 structural folding and, consequently, inhibit its transport activity by slowing down the zinc turnover rate. These findings demonstrate the utility of mAbs as allosteric inhibitors of human ZnT8. We also identified a stable ternary complex of a ZnT8 monomer with two distinct Fabs. The ZnT8-mediated proximity of two mAbs allowed for ZnT8 quantification based on a FRET signal between a pair of donor and acceptor fluorophores covalently linked to bound mAbs. In this assay, we used a caged lanthanide donor (terbium cryptate) that is characterized by a long fluorescence emission half-life. The FRET signal derived from the ternary complex can be obtained using a delayed fluorescence measurement after the decay of the short-lived background fluorescence. Thus, the assay can be performed in a homogeneous format without the need to separate the binding complex from unbound mAbs and other nonspecific fluorophores in the binding mix (31.Degorce F. Card A. Soh S. Trinquet E. Knapik G.P. Xie B. HTRF: a technology tailored for drug discovery–a review of theoretical aspects and recent applications.Curr. Chem. Genomics. 2009; 3 (20161833): 22-3210.2174/1875397300903010022Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). This simple add-and-read HTRF assay highlights another utility of mAbs as a ZnT8-specific biosensor. Human ZnT8 (B-form) is a homodimer of two 35.1-kDa protomers, each consisting of a 23.8-kDa transmembrane domain (TMD) followed by a 11.3-kDa CTD. A ZnT8 homodimer is referred to as ZnT8 hereafter. Immunization of ZnT8-KO mice with purified human ZnT8 in proteoliposomes yielded serum antibodies that exhibited a ∼100-fold increase in antibody titers compared with titers of two commercial antibodies directed to linear peptide sequences from the N- and C-terminal domain (NTD and CTD), respectively (32.Merriman C. Huang Q. Gu W. Yu L. Fu D. A subclass of serum anti-ZnT8 antibodies directed to the surface of live pancreatic beta-cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 (29184000): 579-58710.1074/jbc.RA117.000195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Splenocytes of immunized mice were isolated and fused with myeloma cells to establish immortalized hybridomas. Preliminary screening by ELISA identified anti-ZnT8 antibodies that showed different reactivities toward a full-length ZnT8 antigen in proteoliposomes and a monomeric CTD antigen (amino acids 275–369). These hybridoma cells were subjected to single cell sorting and clonal expansion, and then two secreted monoclonal antibodies (mAb20 and mAb39) were purified for further characterization. Commercial anti-NTD and anti-CTD antibodies (NTDA and CTDA) or purified mouse serum antibodies (MSA) from nonimmunized ZnT8-KO mice were used as a positive or negative control. mAb20, mAb39, CTDA, and NTDA all yielded positive readouts against a ZnT8 proteoliposome antigen (Fig. 1A). In contrast, only mAb20 and the positive control CTDA recognized a monomeric CTD antigen. mAb39 and the negative control NTDA gave negative results in ELISA probed with CTD (Fig. 1B), suggesting that mAb20 recognized an epitope distinct from that of mAb39. The formation of stable mAb- or Fab–ZnT8 complexes was examined by analytical size-exclusion HPLC. mAbs in excess to ZnT8 tended to form cross-linked protein aggregates. By adjusting the mAb/ZnT8 stoichiometry, we detected a series of eight distinct monodisperse peaks, labeled 1–8 in Fig. 2. mAb20 and Fab20 were labeled with a green fluorophore and mAb39 with a red fluorophore. mAb20/Fab20 and mAb39 in complex with ZnT8 were monitored in separate channels of a fluorescence detector (Fig. 2). The apparent molecular weight (MW) of each peak was calculated, and its predicted complex composition consistent with the molecular weight is summarized in Table 1. For binary binding, Fab20 formed a single (Fab20)2–ZnT8 complex (peak 3), and mAb20 formed a major mAb20–ZnT8 complex (peak 2). By comparison, mAb39 predominantly formed a (mAb39)2–ZnT8 complex (peak 1) and a secondary mAb39–ZnT8 complex aligning with peak 2. For ternary binding among ZnT8, mAb20/Fab20, and mAb39, both green and red channels recorded similar (mAb39)2–ZnT8–mAb20 (peaks 5 and 7) and mAb39–ZnT8–(Fab20)2 complexes (peaks 6 and 8), indicating that mAb20/Fab20 and mAb39 bound independently to a single ZnT8 (peak 4).Table 1Summary of the binary and ternary complex peaksPeak numberElution timeApparent molecular massComplex compositionminkDa112.3490(mAb39)2 + ZnT8213.5307mAb20 + ZnT8313.9260(Fab20)2 + ZnT8416.4118ZnT8511.7618(mAb39)2 + mAb20 + ZnT8612.9388mAb39 + (Fab20)2 + ZnT8711.7618(mAb39)2 + mAb20 + ZnT8812.9388mAb39 + (Fab20)2 + ZnT8 Open table in a new tab To further characterize antibody binding, we purified the binary (Fab20)2–ZnT8 and ternary (Fab20)2–ZnT8–(Fab39)2 complexes and directly visualized Fab bindings by negative staining EM. The raw images of the binary complex (Fig. 3A) and corresponding 2D reference-free averages revealed two Fabs in one intact complex, each with a characteristic Fab groove that was clearly visible between the variable and constant region (Fig. 3B). Thus, 2-fold symmetry was applied to single-particle 3D reconstruction, yielding a low-resolution (∼3-nm) 3D map. The 3D envelope was fitted with the crystal structures of two Fab molecules (PDB code 1M71) and one ZnT8 homolog, YiiP (PDB code 3H90). The ZnT8 envelop was larger than the crystal structure, likely due to the detergent micelles surrounding the transmembrane region (Fig. 3E). For the ternary complex, the raw images revealed bindings of multiple Fab molecules to a single ZnT8 dimer (Fig. 3C). The representative 2D averages also showed multiple Fab bindings (Fig. 3D). 3D reconstructions revealed three discrete protrusions on the CTD surface (Fig. 3F). The two outer protrusions were in positions similar to but slightly lower than those observed in ZnT8-(Fab20)2; thus, they were assigned as a pair of Fab20 molecules (Fig. 3F). The middle protrusion was larger and could be fitted by two Fab molecules straddling the 2-fold axis at the ZnT8 dimer interface, and therefore assigned as two Fab39 molecules (Fig. 3F). Although the map resolution was insufficient to distinguish different types of Fabs in the ternary complex, homologue structure docking of the 3D model suggested that CTD dimerization was required for mAb39 binding. This finding was supported by a negative mAb39 readout in CTD-ELISA against a monomeric CTD antigen (Fig. 1B). By comparison, each Fab20 bound to a separate CTD monomer in the 3D model (Fig. 3, E and F), in agreement with a positive mAb20 readout in CTD-ELISA. To compare the difference in mAb bindings to native and denatured ZnT8, we used 2% SDS to unfold immobilized ZnT8-His on a Ni-NTA plate, and then compared denatured ELISA readouts with nondenatured replicates. The native readout of mAb20 was about 2-fold higher than the denatured readout (Fig. 4A), indicating a moderate selectivity for folded conformation over unfolded ZnT8. As a control, CTDA reacted with native and denatured ZnT8 indiscriminately. Unexpectedly, mAb39, despite its binding to the dimer interface and anti-CTD negativity (Fig. 1B), was ELISA-positive for denatured ZnT8 immobilized to the Ni-NTA plate (Fig. 4A). One possibility was that mAb39 epitope was close to the C terminus, where a pair of His tags from a ZnT8 dimer might stabilize local dimeric interaction by Ni-NTA binding. To test this hypothesis, we added a bulkier GFP to the C terminus and examined its potential steric hindrance to mAb binding. Size-exclusion HPLC showed that mAb20 shifted the ZnT8-GFP peak leftward as predicted for a mAb20–ZnT8-GFP binary complex (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the C-terminal GFP completely blocked the formation of mAb39–ZnT8-GFP binary complex. The steric clash between GFP and mAb39 binding localized the mAb39 binding site to the C terminus. This result further validated the mAb39 docking to a distal CTD surface straddling the dimer interface (Fig. 3F). mAb binding to a conformational epitope is expected to stabilize the protein folding. Unfolded ZnT8 could be precipitated as protein aggregates by ultracentrifugation. To evaluate the effect of antibody binding on ZnT8 stability, we incubated detergent-solubilized ZnT8 with or without Fab binding and then exposed the protein sample to heat denaturation at 37 °C and monitored the folded ZnT8 in the supernatant post-ultracentrifugation. Quantitative immunoblotting showed that ZnT8 was not stable and began to precipitate after 1 h of heat exposure (Fig. 4C). Fab20 or Fab39 binding delayed the onset of ZnT8 precipitation to 2 h, and this protective effect was further augmented by concurrent bindings of Fab20 and Fab39. At 3 h, only 12% of initial ZnT8 remained in the supernatant, whereas more than 70% of (Fab20)2–ZnT8–(Fab39)2 was still soluble. The stabilizing effects of Fab20 and Fab39 suggested that Fab binding trapped ZnT8 in more stable conformations. We further examined the effect of conformational constraints on kinetics of ZnT8-mediated zinc transport. Purified human ZnT8 was reconstituted into proteoliposomes encapsulated with a zinc fluorescent indicator, FluoZin-3, and then exposed to a sequence of extravesicular zinc concentrations on a stopped-flow apparatus (Fig. 5A). A fixed 1 mm citrate was added to assay buffers with increasing zinc concentrations, yielding free zinc concentrations from 1.6 to 116 μm. This ensured a constant supply of free zinc to satisfy the steady-state condition. The transmembrane orientations of the reconstituted ZnT8 were estimated to expose 50–75% of the CTD on the extravesicular side of proteoliposomes based on the difference in mAb immunofluorescence staining between sealed and detergent-perforated proteoliposomes. Fab20 or Fab39 was loaded to proteoliposomes at an estimated Fab/ZnT8 molar ratio of 2.8. Sizing HPLC of resolubilized, Fab-treated proteoliposomes confirmed the full occupancy of Fab binding. A rapid mixing of proteoliposomes with a zinc buffer triggered a quasi-linear increase of FluoZin-3 fluorescence within the initial 10 s (Fig. 5A). The rate of fluorescence rise was calculated and fitted to the Michaelis–Menten equation (Fig. 5B). The Vmax and Km values of the steady-state kinetics are summarized in Table 2, showing a modest reduction (30–41%) of Vmax by Fab20 or Fab39 as compared with the unbound proteoliposome control. The inhibitory effects of individual Fab bindings were additive, giving a 57% Vmax reduction when ZnT8 was doubly bound with Fab20 and Fab39. The effect size of Fab inhibition was similar to that of a lower-risk Trp-325 variant, which is ∼50% of the higher-risk Arg-325 variant (20.Merriman C. Huang Q. Rutter G.A. Fu D.

https://openalex.org/W2891331901,"Despite effective control of HIV infection with antiretroviral drugs, individuals with HIV have high incidences of secondary diseases. These sequelae, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), are poorly understood and represent a major health burden. To date, predictive biomarkers of HIV-associated secondary disease have been elusive, making preventative clinical management essentially impossible. Here, we applied a newly developed and easy to deploy, multitarget, and high-throughput glycomic analysis to banked HIV+ human plasma samples to determine whether the glycome may include biomarkers that predict future HIV-associated cardiovascular events or CVD diagnoses. Using 324 patient samples, we identified a glycomic fingerprint that was predictive of future CVD events but independent of CD4 counts, diabetes, age, and birth sex, suggesting that the plasma glycome may serve as a biomarker for specific HIV-associated sequelae. Our findings constitute the discovery of novel glycan biomarkers that could classify patients with HIV with elevated risk for CVD and reveal the untapped prognostic potential of the plasma glycome in human disease.-Oswald, D.

https://openalex.org/W2891365274,"The worldwide incidence of neisserial infections, particularly gonococcal infections, is increasingly associated with antibiotic-resistant strains. In particular, extensively drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains that are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins are a major public health concern. There is a pressing clinical need to identify new targets for the development of antibiotics effective against Neisseria-specific processes. In this study, we report that the bacterial disulfide reductase DsbD is highly prevalent and conserved among Neisseria spp. and that this enzyme is essential for survival of N. gonorrhoeae. DsbD is a membrane-bound protein that consists of two periplasmic domains, n-DsbD and c-DsbD, which flank the transmembrane domain t-DsbD. In this work, we show that the two functionally essential periplasmic domains of Neisseria DsbD catalyze electron transfer reactions through unidirectional interdomain interactions, from reduced c-DsbD to oxidized n-DsbD, and that this process is not dictated by their redox potentials. Structural characterization of the Neisseria n- and c-DsbD domains in both redox states provides evidence that steric hindrance reduces interactions between the two periplasmic domains when n-DsbD is reduced, thereby preventing a futile redox cycle. Finally, we propose a conserved mechanism of electron transfer for DsbD and define the residues involved in domain–domain recognition. Inhibitors of the interaction of the two DsbD domains have the potential to be developed as anti-neisserial agents."
https://openalex.org/W2891846231,"Luciferases, aryl- and fatty-acyl CoA synthetases, and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase proteins belong to the class I adenylate-forming enzyme superfamily. The reaction catalyzed by the adenylate-forming enzymes is categorized by a two-step process of adenylation and thioesterification. Although all of these proteins perform a similar two-step process, each family may perform the process to yield completely different results. For example, luciferase proteins perform adenylation and oxidation to produce the green fluorescent light found in fireflies, while fatty-acyl CoA synthetases perform adenylation and thioesterification with coenzyme A to assist in metabolic processes involving fatty acids. This study aligned a total of 374 sequences belonging to the adenylate-forming superfamily. Analysis of the sequences revealed five fully conserved residues throughout all sequences, as well as 78 more residues conserved in at least 60% of sequences aligned. Conserved positions are involved in magnesium and AMP binding and maintaining enzyme structure. Also, ten conserved sequence motifs that included most of the conserved residues were identified. A phylogenetic tree was used to assign sequences into nine different groups. Finally, group entropy analysis identified novel conservations unique to each enzyme group. Common group-specific positions identified in multiple groups include positions critical to coordinating AMP and the CoA-bound product, a position that governs active site shape, and positions that help to maintain enzyme structure through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. These positions could serve as excellent targets for future research."

However, few studies have exhaustively analyzed executive functions (EFs) in this population, especially considering the influence of a wide range of clinical variables. This study analyzes performance in different EF components in ESRD-HD patients compared to a group of healthy controls (HCs), in addition to the acute effects of HD and the associations of cognitive performance with clinical variables.EFs were evaluated pre- and post-HD in 43 ESRD-HD patients and 42 HCs, using a battery of tests designed to assess EF domains. Age, schooling, mood and blood pressure were statistically controlled. Associations between performance and clinical factors were computed by correlations and hierarchical multiple regression analyses.The performance of the ESRD-HD patients was significantly lower than that of HCs in all the EF domains except for planning. Group differences were marginally significant for reasoning. HD produced no acute changes in global performance, with improvements see only in inhibition and working memory. EF scores were positively associated with total number of months previously transplanted, body mass index (BMI), dry weight, and levels of hemoglobin, albumin, ferritin, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, urea, and creatinine.Global EF functioning was lower in ESRD-HD patients than in HCs. No major acute HD-related EF changes were detected. These findings underline the importance of an adequate nutritional status for maintaining executive functioning in ESRD-HD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2892037464,"The current study used a minimalist paradigm to examine young children's capacity to imagine and prepare for certain and uncertain immediate future outcomes. In a counterbalanced order, 2.5-year-old children (N = 32) completed twelve trials each of two tasks: (1) the forked tube task, which assessed their ability to cover two possible tube exits to ensure they would catch a single target with an uncertain future trajectory, and (2) the double tube task, which assessed their ability to cover two separate tube exits to ensure they would catch two targets with certain future trajectories. Even though the optimal preparatory action was the same across both tasks, children were much more likely to spontaneously and consistently demonstrate this action in the double tube task than the forked tube task. Children's responses were unaffected by the number of targets seen in the demonstration phase, and instead appeared to be based on the particular contingencies of each apparatus. These results are consistent with the possibility that young children specifically struggle to imagine and prepare for mutually exclusive versions of uncertain future events."

Here, we attempted to identify potential lipid alterations not identified by the classic methods.We analyzed the serum lipid profile in 40 women in pre- and post-menopause using a lipidomic approach and mass spectrometry. Lipid species presented increased concentrations, with a difference of more than 25% post-menopause and with the ceramides (N.C23:0.Cer, N.C23:0(OH).Cer and N.C24:0(OH).Cer) standing out with a fold change of 1.68, 1.59, and 1.58, respectively. It was also observed that 14 metabolites presented a significant difference in the average concentrations between pre- and post-menopause, especially the ceramide species. Strong and positive correlations were identified between various metabolites and fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. Of note were the association ceramide (N.C10:0.Cer) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE.a.C18:0) between fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin.This study detected lipid alterations, especially in ceramides, post-menopause, as well as correlations with glycidic and lipid markers, which may in the future be useful to investigate diseases associated with menopause."
https://openalex.org/W2891998756,"Scientific mobility can stimulate entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship, acting as a catalyst for reducing imbalances between local and global science and the resulting socio-economic damage. This study evaluates both whether scientific mobility effectively promotes these concepts and the fundamental reasons to articulate effective policies for scientific mobility. Toward this end, a survey has been prepared following the methodology of Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) and current scientific literature. A total of 364 researchers involved in Spanish scientific mobility took part in the study: Spanish scientists abroad (135) and scientists returned to Spain (52), as mobile groups, and young researchers in Spain (177), as a group of scientists who could go abroad, but that have not yet begun to leave. The results demonstrate that scientific mobility does promote entrepreneurship and, especially intrapreneurship. Moreover, since permanent positions are scarce for these groups and their mobility decisions largely depend on job opportunities, the involved Spanish authorities and agents can improve scientific mobility by means suitable policies that make the most of this potential to the benefit of economic growth and job creation."
https://openalex.org/W2890200636,"Background Genetic programming (GP) is an evolutionary computing methodology capable of identifying complex, non-linear patterns in large data sets. Despite the potential advantages of GP over more typical, frequentist statistical approach methods, its applications to survival analyses are rare, at best. The aim of this study was to determine the utility of GP for the automatic development of clinical prediction models. Methods We compared GP against the commonly used Cox regression technique in terms of the development and performance of a cardiovascular risk score using data from the SMART study, a prospective cohort study of patients with symptomatic cardiovascular disease. The composite endpoint was cardiovascular death, non-fatal stroke, and myocardial infarction. A total of 3,873 patients aged 19–82 years were enrolled in the study 1996–2006. The cohort was split 70:30 into derivation and validation sets. The derivation set was used for development of both GP and Cox regression models. These models were then used to predict the discrete hazards at t = 1, 3, and 5 years. The predictive ability of both models was evaluated in terms of their risk discrimination and calibration using the validation set. Results The discrimination of both models was comparable. At time points t = 1, 3, and 5 years the C-index was 0.59, 0.69, 0.64 and 0.66, 0.70, 0.70 for the GP and Cox regression models respectively. At the same time points, the calibration of both models, which was assessed using calibration plots and the generalization of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test statistic, was also comparable, but with the Cox model being better calibrated to the validation data. Conclusion Using empirical data, we demonstrated that a prediction model developed automatically by GP has predictive ability comparable to that of manually tuned Cox regression. The GP model was more complex, but it was developed in a fully automated way and comprised fewer covariates. Furthermore, it did not require the expertise normally needed for its derivation, thereby alleviating the knowledge elicitation bottleneck. Overall, GP demonstrated considerable potential as a method for the automated development of clinical prediction models for diagnostic and prognostic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2890899200,"Background With the emergence of new influenza virus strains that are resistant to current inhibitors such as oseltamivir (anti-neuraminidase (NA)) and amantadine (anti-M2 proton channel), influenza A viruses continue to be a serious threat to the public health worldwide. With this in view, there is a persistent need for the development of broader and more effective vaccines and therapeutics. Identification of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that recognize relatively invariant structures ‎on influenza haemagglutinin (HA) stem has invigorated efforts to develop universal influenza vaccines. Aim The current computational study is designed to identify potential flavonoid inhibitors that bind to the contact epitopes of HA stem that are targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAb). Method In this study, we utilized the three-dimensional crystallographic structure of different HA subtypes (H1, H2, H5, H3, and H7) in complex with bNAb to screen for potential broadly reactive influenza inhibitors. We performed Quantitative Structure-Activity and Relationship (QSAR) for 100 natural compounds known for their antiviral activity and performed molecular docking using AutoDock 4.2 suite. Furthermore, we conducted virtual screening of 1413 bioassay hit compounds by using virtual lab bench CLC Drug Discovery. Results The results showed 18 lead flavonoids with strong binding abilities to bNAb epitopes of various HA subtypes. These 18 broadly reactive compounds exhibited significant interactions with an average of seven Hbonds, docking energy of -22.43 kcal·mol−1, and minimum interaction ‎ energy of -4.65 kcal·mol−1, with functional contact residues. Procyanidin depicted strong interactions with group 1 HAs, whereas both sorbitol and procyanidin exhibited significant interactions with group 2 HAs. Conclusion Using in silico docking analysis, we identified 18 bioactive flavonoids with potential strong binding cababilities to influenza HA-stems of various subtypes, which are the target for bNAb. The virtual screened bioassay hit compounds depicted a high number of Hbonds but low interaction and docking values compared to antiviral flavonoids. Using structure-based design and nanotechnology-based approaches, identified molecules could be modified to generate next generation anti-influenza drugs."

To improve our understanding of heme a insertion into cytochrome c oxidase, here we investigated the protein–protein interactions that involve Cox15 in S. cerevisiae.

When supercomplex formation was abolished, as in the case of stalled cytochrome bc1 or cytochrome c oxidase assembly, Cox15 maintained an interaction with select proteins from both respiratory complexes. In the case of stalled cytochrome bc1 assembly, Cox15 interacted with the late-assembling cytochrome c oxidase subunit, Cox13. When cytochrome c oxidase assembly was stalled, Cox15 unexpectedly maintained its interaction with the cytochrome bc1 protein, Cor1. Our results indicate that Cox15 and Cor1 continue to interact in the cytochrome bc1 dimer even in the absence of supercomplexes or when the supercomplexes are destabilized.

https://openalex.org/W2892116841,"Obesity and its impact on health is a multifaceted phenomenon encompassing many factors, including demographics, environment, lifestyle, and psychosocial functioning. A systems science approach, investigating these many influences, is needed to capture the complexity and multidimensionality of obesity prevention to improve health. Leveraging baseline data from a unique clinical cohort comprising 333 postmenopausal overweight or obese breast cancer survivors participating in a weight-loss trial, we applied Bayesian networks, a machine learning approach, to infer interrelationships between lifestyle factors (e.g., sleep, physical activity), body mass index (BMI), and health outcomes (biomarkers and self-reported quality of life metrics). We used bootstrap resampling to assess network stability and accuracy, and Bayesian information criteria (BIC) to compare networks. Our results identified important behavioral subnetworks. BMI was the primary pathway linking behavioral factors to glucose regulation and inflammatory markers; the BMI-biomarker link was reproduced in 100% of resampled networks. Sleep quality was a hub impacting mental quality of life and physical health with > 95% resampling reproducibility. Omission of the BMI or sleep links significantly degraded the fit of the networks. Our findings suggest potential mechanistic pathways and useful intervention targets for future trials. Using our models, we can make quantitative predictions about health impacts that would result from targeted, weight loss and/or sleep improvement interventions. Importantly, this work highlights the utility of Bayesian networks in health behaviors research."
https://openalex.org/W2891081576,"Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and the implementation of primary HPV screening in the Netherlands will lead to a lower cervical disease burden. For evaluation and further improvement of prevention, it is important to estimate the magnitude and timing of health benefits of current and alternative vaccination strategies such as vaccination of boys or adults. Methods and findings We evaluated the impact of the current girls-only vaccination program and alternative strategies on cervical disease burden among the first four vaccinated five-year birth cohorts, given the context of primary HPV screening. We integrated the existing microsimulation models STDSIM (HPV transmission model) and MISCAN-Cervix (cervical cancer screening model). Alternative vaccination strategies include: improved vaccination uptake, including routine boys vaccination, and offering adult vaccination at sexual health clinics. Our models show that the current vaccination program is estimated to reduce cervical cancers and cancer deaths by about 35% compared to primary HPV screening in the absence of vaccination. The number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to gain 1 life year is 45. The most efficient alternative vaccination strategies are: 1) improving coverage of girls to 80% (NNV = 42); and 2) routine vaccination for girls and boys at 80% coverage (incremental NNV = 155), with cervical cancer mortality reductions estimated at 50% and 60% respectively. Conclusions While the current program already substantially reduces cervical cancer incidence and mortality, prevention can be further improved by increasing vaccination uptake and extending vaccination to boys. As not all cervical cancer deaths will be prevented, screening participation should still be encouraged."
https://openalex.org/W2891281891,"Objective Red cell distribution width (RDW) is associated with mortality and bloodstream infection risk in the critically ill. In vascular surgery patients surviving critical care it is not known if RDW can predict subsequent risk of all-cause mortality following hospital discharge. We hypothesized that an increase in RDW at hospital discharge in vascular surgery patients who received critical care would be associated with increased mortality following hospital discharge. Design, setting, and participants We performed a two-center observational cohort study of critically ill non-cardiac vascular surgery patients surviving admission 18 years or older treated between November, 1997, and December 2012 in Boston, Massachusetts. Exposures RDW measured within 24 hours of hospital discharge and categorized a priori as ≤13.3%, 13.3–14.0%, 14.0–14.7%, 14.7–15.8%, >15.8%. Main outcomes and measures The primary outcome was all cause mortality in the 90 days following hospital discharge. Results The cohort included 4,715 patients (male 58%; white 83%; mean age 62.9 years). 90 and 365-day post discharge mortality was 7.5% and 14.4% respectively. In the cohort, 47.3% were discharged to a care facility and 14.8% of patients were readmitted within 30 days. After adjustment for age, gender, race, Deyo-Charlson comorbidity Index, patient type, acute organ failures, prior vascular surgery and vascular surgery category, patients with a discharge RDW 14.7–15.8% or >15.8% have an adjusted OR of 90-day post discharge mortality of 2.52 (95%CI, 1.29–4.90; P = 0.007) or 5.13 (95%CI, 2.70–9.75; P <0.001) relative to patients with a discharge RDW ≤13.3%. The adjusted odds of 30-day readmission in the RDW >15.8% group was 1.52 (95%CI, 1.12–2.07; P = 0.007) relative to patients with a discharge RDW ≤13.3%. Similar adjusted discharge RDW-outcome associations are present at 365 days following hospital discharge and for discharge to a care facility. Conclusions In critically ill vascular surgery patients who survive hospitalization, an elevated RDW at hospital discharge is a strong predictor of subsequent mortality, hospital readmission and placement in a care facility. Patients with elevated RDW are at high risk for adverse out of hospital outcomes and may benefit from closer post discharge follow-up and higher intensity rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W2891383811,"Influenza constitutes a major challenge to world health authorities due to high transmissibility and the capacity to generate large epidemics. This study aimed to characterize the diffusion process of influenza A (H1N1) by identifying the starting point of the epidemic as well as climatic and sociodemographic factors associated with the occurrence and intensity of transmission of the disease. The study was carried out in the Brazilian state of Paraná, where H1N1 caused the largest impact. The units of spatial and temporal analysis were the municipality of residence of the cases and the epidemiological weeks of the year 2009, respectively. Under the Bayesian paradigm, parametric inference was performed through a two-part spatiotemporal model and the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) algorithm. We identified the most likely starting points through the effective distance measure based on mobility networks. The proposed estimation methodology allowed for rapid and efficient implementation of the spatiotemporal model, and provided evidence of different patterns for chance of occurrence and risk of influenza throughout the epidemiological weeks. The results indicate the capital city of Curitiba as the probable starting point, and showed that the interventions that focus on municipalities with greater migration and density of people, especially those with higher Human Development Indexes (HDIs) and the presence of municipal air and road transport, could play an important role in mitigation of effects of future influenza pandemics on public health. These results provide important information on the process of introduction and spread of influenza, and could contribute to the identification of priority areas for surveillance as well as establishment of strategic measures for disease prevention and control. The proposed model also allows identification of epidemiological weeks with high chance of influenza occurrence, which can be used as a reference criterion for creating an immunization campaign schedule."
https://openalex.org/W2890007595,"Cyclic α-maltosyl-(1→6)-maltose (CMM, cyclo-{→6)-α-d-Glcp-(1→4)-α-d-Glcp-(1→6)-α-d-Glcp-(1→4)-α-d-Glcp-(1→})is a cyclic glucotetrasaccharide with alternating α-1,4 and α-1,6 linkages. CMM is composed of two maltose units and is one of the smallest cyclic glucooligosaccharides. Although CMM is resistant to usual amylases, it is efficiently hydrolyzed by CMM hydrolase (CMMase), belonging to subfamily 20 of glycoside hydrolase family 13 (GH13_20). Here, we determined the ligand-free crystal structure of CMMase from the soil-associated bacterium Arthrobacter globiformis and its structures in complex with maltose, panose, and CMM to elucidate the structural basis of substrate recognition by CMMase. The structures disclosed that although the monomer structure consists of three domains commonly adopted by GH13 and other α-amylase-related enzymes, CMMase forms a unique wing-like dimer structure. The complex structure with CMM revealed four specific subsites, namely -3', -2, -1, and +1'. We also observed that the bound CMM molecule adopts a low-energy conformer compared with the X-ray structure of a single CMM crystal, also determined here. Comparison of the CMMase active site with those in other enzymes of the GH13_20 family revealed that three regions forming the wall of the cleft, denoted PYF (Pro-203/Tyr-204/Phe-205), CS (Cys-163/Ser-164), and Y (Tyr-168), are present only in CMMase and are involved in CMM recognition. Combinations of multiple substitutions in these regions markedly decreased the activity toward CMM, indicating that the specificity for this cyclic tetrasaccharide is supported by the entire shape of the pocket. In summary, our work uncovers the mechanistic basis for the highly specific interactions of CMMase with its substrate CMM."

Healthy young adults (n = 24, age = 27.46 ± 4.65 years) performed a passive knee position-matching task on an isokinetic dynamometer with each leg separately. We determined the magnitude of compression by measuring anatomical thigh cross sectional area (CSA) in standing using magnetic resonance imaging. Wearing the CG compressed CSA by 2% (t = 2.91, p = 0.010, Cohen’s d = 0.68). Repeated measures ANOVA (rANOVA) with three repetition factors (condition: CG, no CG; leg: right dominant, left non-dominant; and target angles: 30°, 45°, 60°) revealed an effect of angles (p < 0.001), where the matching of knee joint position was more accurate at 60° compared to 30° and 45° (p < 0.001). However, CG did not reduce passive joint position sense errors. In fact, joint position error was less without CG (p = 0.014). In conclusion, while CG does compress the thigh it does not afford the purported benefits for proprioception as measured by a target-matching task in the present study."
https://openalex.org/W2890781377,"The seeds of Salix and Populus (Salicaceae) are characterized by having numerous long hairs which loosely accompanying the seeds and a small annular appendage which surrounding the base of the seed along with tufted hairs. In this study, the complete development and detailed structure of the hairs and annular appendage in Salix matsudana were investigated using standard techniques for plant anatomy and histochemistry. The results show that the hairs originate successively from the single epidermal cells of the placenta (in megaspore mother cell phase) and funiculus (in eight-nucleate phase), and that their development consists of a progressive increase in cell size and an absence of cell division. The annular appendage is initiated from four to five rows of cells at the distal end of the funiculus in octant proembryo phase and its development is characterized by reactivated meristematic activity and a size increase of these cells. The initiation and development of the hairs are irrelevant to ovule development but fertilization and a developed embryo is necessary for the annular appendage to occur. Considering the reliable fossils, we inferred that the feature of seeds surrounded by long hairs is an ancestral character, and that the detachment of hairs from the funiculus and the occurrence of an annular appendage with tufts of hairs may be the more derived states for seed dispersal in Salix and Populus."
https://openalex.org/W2891971858,"Background Despite the general agreement regarding the central role of the clinical learning environment in graduate medical education, its assessment remains challenging owing to the lack of available standardized measures. We report on the cross-cultural adaptation and psychometric assessment of the Brazilian-Portuguese version of Seelig’s Resident Questionnaire. Methods The present study was performed in two steps. First, a cross-cultural translation and adaptation of the Resident Questionnaire was conducted through multiple translations, synthesis of versions, back-translation, content validation, and face validation. Subsequently, a sample of 288 (72%) resident physicians enrolled in 40 residency programs at a Brazilian university hospital completed the following measures: 1) the Brazilian-Portuguese version of the Resident Questionnaire (for factor analysis and to determine internal consistency, reliability, and validity); 2) three existing, validated psychometric measures (to determine convergent and divergent validity); and 3) a self-report questionnaire. Results Confirmatory factor analysis results provided support for the three-dimensional model of the Resident Questionnaire in use on a sample of Brazilian resident physicians, having been previously verified for use in American samples. All three factors (emotional distress, learning environment satisfaction, and workload satisfaction) verified in the confirmatory factor analysis showed good internal consistency (α > .80), reliability (Raykov’s rho > .80), and correlations in the expected directions and magnitude with measures of depressive symptoms, duty hours, organizational conditions, and emotional exhaustion. Conclusions This study is the first to adapt a measure of the clinical learning environment of residency programs into Brazilian Portuguese. Our findings suggest that the adapted version of the Resident Questionnaire is valid and reliable for assessing Brazilian residency programs. This free, easy-access, and fast-application instrument may be a useful standardized measure for research and educational purposes concerning the clinical learning environments of resident physicians."
