Final volume, 0.25 ml. All tubes were in- cubated 30 minutes at 35” and aliquots were assayed by the paper disk procedure (4). Molarities are the final concentration of added salt with the exception of the last entry, where molarity is total phosphate. The 0.04 M phosphate reaction, the control for all reactions in this series, incorporated 2.0 mpmoles of dGMPs2. Partial purification of a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-synthe- sizing enzyme from calf thymus gland has been achieved. The purified enzyme preparation requires the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates of adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine, Mg++, and primer DNA for activity. The synthetic reaction is in- hibited by pyrophosphate and, if radioactive pyrophosphate is used, it is incorporated into deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate. The over-all reaction may therefore be written: Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates , DNA, Mg++"

Some clinical observations (Bouckaert, A., and Hart Kliniek, H., personal communication) and preliminary experiments (Bouckaert, J. H., and Oyaert, W., personal communication) indicated that vitamin K had a real effect on all collagen tissues and especially bone tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2123030571,"THE detection of catechol in acid-hydrolysed normal human urine and cow's urine was reported recently by von Euler and Lishajko1. The origin of the catechol was not known. The excretion of hippuric acid in the urine of man after oral ingestion of calcium quinate was reported by Lautemann in 18632. It occurred to us that if an aromatic ring can be formed in the animal body from quinic acid (1 : 3 : 4 : 5-tetrahydroxycyclohexane carboxylic acid), then urinary catechol might have a similar origin. Further, an exogenous (dietary) precursor is implicated since we are unable to detect catechol in the urine of rats fed a highly purified diet. Quinic and shikimic acids are known to be present in edible plants."
https://openalex.org/W2004526879,"GLUTAMIC dehydrogenase has been demonstrated in several higher plants1 and is associated with mitochondria of pea2 and oat3. Mitochondria isolated from mung bean (Phaseolus aureus) seedlings4 were found capable of oxidizing glutamic acid (90 &µl. oxygen/hr./mgm. (nitrogen). The assay of glutamic dehydrogenase in intact mitochondria is limited by a permeability barrier to pyridine nucleotides. Reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide was oxidized by mitochondria suspended in 0.2 M sucrose, 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (change in optical density at 340 mµ of 0.1 in 4 min.) and the addition of 0.1 per cent (v/v) of a non-ionic detergent, O.P.C. 45 (Petrochemicals Ltd., London) increased the oxidation rate by 240 per cent. The suspension of mitochondria was immediately clarified by the addition of O.P.C. 45. To assay glutamic dehydrogenase, intact mitochondria were broken by exposure to 0.1 per cent O.P.C. 45 at 0°C. and immediately centrifuged for 30 min. at 20,000 g. The supernatant was assayed for glutamic dehydrogenase using the system : 0.02 M potassium glutamate, 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 and 0.0001 di- or tri-phosphopyridine nucleotide and measuring reduction of the nucleotides at 340 mµ. The glutamic dehydrogenase activity released by this method accounted for all the glutamic acid oxidase activity of the whole mitochondria. Freezing and thawing the mitochondria suspended in 0.1 M potassium bicarbonate5, released 61 per cent of total soluble glutamic dehydrogenase. Incubation of the potassium bicarbonate extract with 0.1 per cent O.P.C. 45 for 1 hr. at 0°C. was not found to inhibit the activity of glutamic dehydrogenase. Glutamic dehydrogenase reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide four times as rapidly as it reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide. Dual specificity may be due to the presence of a transhydrogenase which has been demonstrated in pea mitochondria2. Reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide produced by glutamic dehydrogenase and glutamic acid was oxidised on the addition of α-ketoglutarate or ammonium chloride, indicating the reversibility of the system."

https://openalex.org/W2091429310,Mice allowed to run in a revolving-drum activity cage are sensitive indicators of air pollution. They respond to the presence of synthetic smog by diminishing their 24-hour activity in the revolving wheels. The redLIction in wheel activity is comparatively greater for larger amounts of smog.

https://openalex.org/W30980396,"In previous studies’ with a dialyzed supernatant fraction from rat liver it was observed that the formation of heptulose phosphate from fructose g-phosphate was significantly inhibited by inorganic phosphate. It has since been shown (1, 2) that the activity of the dialyzed liver fraction can be related to its content of transketolase and transaldolase and it became of interest to determine whether the inhibition of the over-all process by phosphate was due to its effect on one or both of the enzymes involved in this process. Preliminary experiments indicated that both transketolase and transaldolase were inhibited by inorganic phosphate when the enzymes were tested in the usual assay procedures. The effect of phosphate on transaldolase is reported in the present paper."

The epinephrine and norepinephrine were administered in such a way that a slow, prolonged rate of absorption was achieved. Under these conditions, the lethality and cataract-producing ability of these amines were shown to be significantly enhanced by the action of iproniazid."

https://openalex.org/W2043819824,"THE difficulty encountered in the determination of the physical and chemical properties of the urinary gonadotropin is closely related to its small concentration in urine. It is also the reason why so many studies concerning this hormone refer mainly to its biological properties. Nevertheless, it would be of considerable interest to obtain gondadotropin of high purity. That is why we attempted to isolate it from the urine of sterilized women or women at the menopause. We report here our preliminary results."
https://openalex.org/W1997931049,"A RECENT communication reported the occurrence of all the ‘unhindered’ forms of vitamin A in fish-liver oils1. The isomers may be classified according to the rate of reaction with maleic anhydride as either ‘fast’- or ‘slow’-reacting2,3. Lambertsen and Brækkan4 reported the presence of only small amounts of neovitamin A in fresh fish livers, as measured by the method of Robeson and Baxter5. The method only distinguishes between ‘fast’- and ‘slow’-reacting isomers3. At present our work with vitamin A deals only with these groups and not with the determination of the different isomers. The reported content of 14 per cent of iso-a (fast) + iso-b (slow) vitamin A in rat liver1, however, prompts us to publish some of our findings not yet recorded."

https://openalex.org/W2024511424,"IN previous experiments on the aerobic degradation of D-xylose by living cells of Torulopsis utilis, we succeeded in isolating the triose-phosphate, pyruvic acid and the acetyl groups using the phenylhydrazine trapping technique. Our results have been confirmed by Heath et al. 3, who purified from Lactobacillus pentosus an enzyme which phosphorolytically cleaves D-xylulose-5-phosphate into triose-phosphate and acetyl-phosphate. Schramm and Racker4 have shown in a mutant of Acetobacter xylinum the presence of an enzyme which carries out the same phosphorolytic split of D-xylulose-5-phosphate and cleaves also the fructose-6-phosphate into erythrose-4-phosphate and acetyl-phosphate. From the results of our preceding experiments we supposed a split of an intermediate phosphorylated ketopentose into triose-phosphate and into an unknown C-2 intermediate, both originating the acetyl group according to the formulation given in ref. 2."
