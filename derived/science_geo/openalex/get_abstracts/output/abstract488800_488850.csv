Shared features of this syndrome include a distinctive facial appearance, intellectual disability and greater height. Overgrowth disorders are a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by increased growth parameters and other variable clinical features such as intellectual disability and facial dysmorphism1. To identify new causes of human overgrowth, we performed exome sequencing in ten proband-parent trios and detected two de novo DNMT3A mutations. We identified 11 additional de novo mutations by sequencing DNMT3A in a further 142 individuals with overgrowth. The mutations alter residues in functional DNMT3A domains, and protein modeling suggests that they interfere with domain-domain interactions and histone binding. Similar mutations were not present in 1,000 UK population controls (13/152 cases versus 0/1,000 controls; P < 0.0001). Mutation carriers had a distinctive facial appearance, intellectual disability and greater height. DNMT3A encodes a DNA methyltransferase essential for establishing methylation during embryogenesis and is commonly somatically mutated in acute myeloid leukemia2,3,4. Thus, DNMT3A joins an emerging group of epigenetic DNA- and histone-modifying genes associated with both developmental growth disorders and hematological malignancies5."
https://openalex.org/W2129149800,"Models of transcription are often built around a picture of RNA polymerase and transcription factors (TFs) acting on a single copy of a promoter. However, most TFs are shared between multiple genes with varying binding affinities. Beyond that, genes often exist at high copy number-in multiple identical copies on the chromosome or on plasmids or viral vectors with copy numbers in the hundreds. Using a thermodynamic model, we characterize the interplay between TF copy number and the demand for that TF. We demonstrate the parameter-free predictive power of this model as a function of the copy number of the TF and the number and affinities of the available specific binding sites; such predictive control is important for the understanding of transcription and the desire to quantitatively design the output of genetic circuits. Finally, we use these experiments to dynamically measure plasmid copy number through the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2064146024,"Fungi are a large, complex group, increasingly recognized as emerging threats. Their roles as modifiers of health mandate accurate portrayals of fungal communities in humans. As an entry point into the airways and gastrointestinal tract, fungi in the mouth are relevant to several biocompartments. We have revised current practices in sequence-based taxonomy assignments and employed the improvements to address the question of the fungal genera present in the healthy human mouth. The human oral mycobiome was surveyed using massively parallel, high throughput sequencing of internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) amplicons from saliva following robust extraction methods. Taxonomy was assigned by comparison to a curated reference dataset, followed by filtering with an empirically determined BLAST E-value match statistic (10(-42)). Nomenclature corrections further refined results by conjoining redundant names for a single fungal genus. Following these curation steps, about two-thirds of the initially identified genera were eliminated. In comparison with the one similar metagenomic study and several earlier culture-based ones, our findings change the current conception of the oral mycobiome, especially with the discovery of the high prevalence and abundance of the genus Malassezia. Previously identified as an important pathogen of the skin, and recently reported as the predominant fungal genus at the nostril and backs of the head and ear, this is the first account of Malassezia in the human mouth. Findings from this study were in good agreement with others on the existence of many consensus members of the core mycobiome, and on unique patterns for individual subjects. This research offered a cautionary note about unconditional acceptance of lengthy lists of community members produced by automated assignments, provided a roadmap for enhancing the likely biological relevance of sequence-based fungal surveys, and built the foundation for understanding the role of fungi in health and disease of the oral cavity."

While they represent a sparse population of neurons within the striatum (1%–2%), cholinergic interneurons have been implicated in multiple striatal functions, including motor control, associative learning, and reward (Exley and Cragg, 2008Exley R.

Although the precise mechanism by which cholinergic interneurons control striatal output has not yet been elucidated, recent studies provide interesting clues. Activation of dorsal striatal cholinergic interneurons drives inhibitory responses in the principal cells of the striatum, medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and other cholinergic interneurons (English et al., 2012English D.F.

Optogenetically evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) have two distinct components: a fast component (fIPSC) with a decay time constant of approximately 5 ms and a slower component (sIPSC) with a time constant of about 90 ms (English et al., 2012English D.F. Ibanez-Sandoval O. Stark E. Tecuapetla F. Buzsáki G. Deisseroth K. Tepper J.M. Koos T. GABAergic circuits mediate the reinforcement-related signals of striatal cholinergic interneurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 123-130Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Disynaptic inhibition via a rare striatal GABAergic interneuron subtype, neurogliaform cells, appears to explain a substantial portion of the sIPSC (English et al., 2012English D.F. Ibanez-Sandoval O. Stark E. Tecuapetla F. Buzsáki G. Deisseroth K. Tepper J.M. Koos T. GABAergic circuits mediate the reinforcement-related signals of striatal cholinergic interneurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 123-130Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, the source of the fIPSC has not been identified. In principle, the fIPSC may be monosynaptic or disynaptic. A disynaptic process would involve first a cholinergic synapse and then a GABAergic synapse. If disynaptic, two features of the fIPSC are as yet unclear: (1) whether cholinergic control of GABA release is mediated by axon-to-dendrite versus axon-to-axon-terminal neurotransmission, and (2) what cell type releases GABA. Two cell types are good candidates by virtue of being activated by nicotinic receptors and their ability to drive large, fast inhibitory responses in MSNs: fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) (Koós and Tepper, 2002Koós T. Tepper J.M. Dual cholinergic control of fast-spiking interneurons in the neostriatum.J.

Liang Y. Dani J.A. Endogenous nicotinic cholinergic activity regulates dopamine release in the striatum.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1224-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Recent experiments have also demonstrated that dopaminergic neurons can release both dopamine and GABA, both of which depend on the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) (Tritsch et al., 2012Tritsch N.X. Ding J.B. Sabatini B.L. Dopaminergic neurons inhibit striatal output through non-canonical release of GABA.Nature. 2012; 490: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Here, we test the potential roles of striatal FSIs and dopamine terminals in mediating cholinergically triggered disynaptic IPSCs in MSNs. Using a combination of methods, we demonstrate that the fast portion of the IPSC is mediated by cholinergic activation of GABA release from striatal dopaminergic terminals, which is action potential independent. These findings suggest that cholinergic interneurons are able to rapidly regulate striatal output through GABAergic inhibition, while simultaneously exerting neuromodulatory control via dopamine and acetylcholine signaling. We used an optogenetic approach to explore how cholinergic interneuron activity influences striatal output neurons. Injection of a Cre-dependent virus (AAV2/1-DIO-ChR2-mCherry) encoding channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in the dorsal striatum of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-Cre mice produced selective ChR2 expression in striatal cholinergic interneurons (Figure 1A). To physiologically confirm ChR2 expression in cholinergic interneurons, we performed whole-cell current-clamp recordings of mCherry-positive neurons. These neurons showed typical intrinsic properties, including spontaneous action potential firing, pronounced action potential afterhyperpolarization, and a characteristic voltage sag with hyperpolarizing current (Kawaguchi, 1993Kawaguchi Y. Physiological, morphological, and histochemical characterization of three classes of interneurons in rat neostriatum.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4908-4923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). Brief (5 ms) blue light pulses triggered action potentials in mCherry-positive putative cholinergic neurons (Figure 1B). To isolate inhibitory synaptic currents triggered by activation of cholinergic neurons, we performed whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of medium spiny neurons in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists NBQX and D-APV. Using a high-chloride internal solution to promote detection of GABAergic currents, blue light pulses elicited IPSCs measuring 1,830 ± 290 pA (n = 37). This light-evoked IPSC was characterized by distinct phases of decay, as has been described previously (English et al., 2012English D.F. Ibanez-Sandoval O. Stark E. Tecuapetla F. Buzsáki G. Deisseroth K. Tepper J.M. Koos T. GABAergic circuits mediate the reinforcement-related signals of striatal cholinergic interneurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 123-130Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar): the fIPSC had a decay time constant of 5.2 ± 1.0 ms, while an sIPSC had a decay time constant of 90 ± 7 ms (Figure 1C). Both IPSC phases were blocked by the GABAA antagonist picrotoxin (50 μM; 98% ± 0.4% block; n = 6; p = 0.009; Figure 1C), which was shown previously with bicuculline (English et al., 2012English D.F. Ibanez-Sandoval O. Stark E. Tecuapetla F. Buzsáki G. Deisseroth K. Tepper J.M. Koos T. GABAergic circuits mediate the reinforcement-related signals of striatal cholinergic interneurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 123-130Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar), confirming that the IPSC is GABAergic. Delivery of two blue light pulses at short intervals produced IPSCs with marked paired-pulse depression; full recovery of the IPSC occurred between 30 and 60 s (Figure S1 available online). Single blue light pulses could block action potentials in MSNs under physiological conditions (see example, Figure 1C), demonstrating the potential functional relevance of these inhibitory responses. To determine whether light-evoked IPSCs differed between direct- and indirect-pathway medium spiny neurons, a subset of experiments were performed in ChAT-Cre:Drd1a-Tomato mice, which express the fluorescent reporter tdTomato in dopamine D1 receptor-containing neurons (Shuen et al., 2008Shuen J.A. Chen M. Gloss B. Calakos N. Drd1a-tdTomato BAC transgenic mice for simultaneous visualization of medium spiny neurons in the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 2681-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Optogenetically evoked IPSCs were comparable in interleaved D1-Tomato-positive and -negative MSNs (Figure 1D), measuring 990 ± 210 pA (n = 14) and 920 ± 110 pA (n = 12, p = 0.6), respectively. To determine whether rebound firing by cholinergic interneurons could also drive IPSCs, the inhibitory opsin halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0) was expressed in cholinergic interneurons. In ChAT-Cre mice injected with AAV5-DIO-eNpHR3.0-YFP, yellow light caused hyperpolarization of the membrane potential in cholinergic interneurons and, at the offset of such pulses, rebound spiking (Figure 1E). Voltage-clamp recordings of MSNs showed large IPSCs at the offset of yellow light pulses (Figure 1E), which were similar in amplitude (1,130 ± 230 pA; n = 5) and kinetics (tau decay times for fast and slow components 6.2 ± 1.5 and 127.6 ± 28.2 ms, respectively) to IPSCs elicited with ChR2 activation. These findings suggest that cholinergic interneuron activity, triggered by direct depolarization or rebound following hyperpolarization, can lead to large IPSCs in MSNs. Light-evoked IPSCs could, in principle, be derived from monosynaptic GABA release by cholinergic interneurons themselves, as has been shown in the retina (Lee et al., 2010Lee S. Kim K. Zhou Z.J. Role of ACh-GABA cotransmission in detecting image motion and motion direction.Neuron. 2010; 68: 1159-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), or through a disynaptic mechanism (Figure S2). A disynaptic mechanism should depend on transmitter release from cholinergic interneurons onto a second class of GABA-containing neurons. Indeed, the fast portion of the IPSC was reconstituted by local application of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (10 mM) near the recorded MSN. Carbachol produced large-amplitude IPSCs (850 ± 160 pA, n = 11), which were blocked by picrotoxin (50 μM; Figure 2A). This carbachol-triggered IPSC had a tau decay of 7.2 ± 1.1 ms (n = 11) comparable to the fast component of the light-evoked IPSC, suggesting that local application could selectively recruit GABA release responsible for the fIPSC. Carbachol-triggered IPSCs were also blocked by the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine (5 μM; Figure 2A), indicating that they are mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Dependence of light-evoked responses on acetylcholine release was confirmed using cholinergic receptor antagonists. IPSC amplitude was not significantly reduced by the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (10 μM; 3% ± 7% block; n = 5; p = 0.39) or the α7 nicotinic receptor antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA, 10 nM; 15% ± 11% block; n = 7; p = 0.14) but was potently inhibited by the nicotinic antagonists mecamylamine (5 μM; 97% ± 2% block; n = 5; p = 0.038) and dihydrobetaerythroidine (DHβE, 10 μM; 93% ± 3% block; n = 5; p = 0.034; Figure 2B). These experiments demonstrated that the IPSC depends on non-α7-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and suggested a disynaptic mechanism. Disynaptic IPSCs could derive from cholinergic stimulation of an action potential in a second neuron, resulting in action-potential-dependent release of GABA onto MSNs. Alternatively, acetylcholine could activate nicotinic receptors at sites of GABA release, eliciting IPSCs in MSNs without a requirement for action potentials (see Figure S2). To investigate this latter possibility, we activated cholinergic interneurons and recorded IPSCs in MSNs while applying the sodium channel antagonist tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 μM), which would be expected to block action potentials in both the cholinergic interneuron and putative GABAergic neurons. TTX application resulted in a complete block of the disynaptic IPSC (Figure 2C). However, application of TTX together with the potassium channel antagonist 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 100 μM), which enables ChR2-mediated release of neurotransmitter without action potentials (Petreanu et al., 2012Petreanu L. Gutnisky D.A. Huber D. Xu N.L. O’Connor D.H. Tian L. Looger L. Svoboda K. Activity in motor-sensory projections reveals distributed coding in somatosensation.Nature. 2012; 489: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), partially restored the IPSC (Figure 2C). The average amplitude of IPSCs after addition of TTX and 4-AP was 43% ± 11% (n = 14) of the control IPSC, and the area under the IPSC (net charge) after addition of TTX and 4-AP was 77% ± 17% of the control IPSC (n = 14; Figure 2C). Using a similar method, the net charge of the carbachol-triggered IPSC in the presence of TTX and 4-AP was 79% ± 16% of control (n = 6; Figure 2C). These results support the hypothesis that a substantial portion of the IPSC triggered by cholinergic interneuron stimulation is through an action-potential-independent mechanism. Though activation of nicotinic receptors led to GABA release, it was unclear whether synaptic vesicle release was triggered directly by calcium influx through nicotinic receptors or through recruitment of additional calcium sources, such as voltage-gated calcium channels or internal calcium stores. As optogenetically evoked IPSCs were blocked by DHβE but not by MLA, the nicotinic receptors involved are a non-α7-containing subtype, with lower calcium permeability (Rice and Cragg, 2004Rice M.E. Cragg S.J. Nicotine amplifies reward-related dopamine signals in striatum.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 583-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), and are thus less likely to participate directly in vesicle fusion. Suspecting voltage-gated calcium channels might provide the necessary calcium, we elicited IPSCs with pressure-ejected carbachol and applied cadmium chloride, a nonselective blocker of voltage-gated calcium channels that does not block α4-containing nicotinic receptors (Karadsheh et al., 2004Karadsheh M.S. Shah M.S. Tang X. Macdonald R.L. Stitzel J.A. Functional characterization of mouse alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors stably expressed in HEK293T cells.J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 1138-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cadmium markedly reduced IPSC amplitude (n = 5; p = 0.01; Figure 2D), suggesting voltage-gated calcium channels are required for nicotinic activation of GABA release. In the hippocampus, nicotinic depolarization of axon terminals triggers GABA release through T-type calcium channels (Tang et al., 2011Tang A.H. Karson M.A. Nagode D.A. McIntosh J.M. Uebele V.N. Renger J.J. Klugmann M. Milner T.A. Alger B.E. Nerve terminal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors initiate quantal GABA release from perisomatic interneurons by activating axonal T-type (Cav3) Ca2+ channels and Ca2+ release from stores.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 13546-13561Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), so we proceeded to test the role of these channels in light-evoked disynaptic inhibition. The specific T-type calcium channel blocker mibefradil (5 μM) reduced the light-evoked IPSC by 41% ± 6% (n = 8, p = 0.02; data not shown) and the carbachol-evoked IPSC by 67% ± 3% (n = 4; Figure 2D). Together, these results suggest that presynaptic nicotinic receptor activation leads to the recruitment of voltage-gated calcium channels, including T-type channels, to cause sufficient calcium influx for release of GABA onto MSNs. While these findings suggest that the fIPSC triggered by activation of cholinergic interneurons is likely to be disynaptic and action potential independent, they do not indicate which neurons release GABA. FSIs drive large inhibitory synaptic responses in MSNs, making them a candidate source of GABA for the fast disynaptic ISPC (Gittis et al., 2010Gittis A.H. Nelson A.B. Thwin M.T. Palop J.J. Kreitzer A.C. Distinct roles of GABAergic interneurons in the regulation of striatal output pathways.J.

Neurosci. 1999; 2: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). To determine whether FSIs are required for disynaptic inhibition, we selectively ablated a majority of the parvalbumin (PV)-positive FSIs by injecting the striatum of PV-Cre mice (Figure 3A) with a Cre-dependent virus encoding pro-caspase-3 and an enzyme that cleaves pro-caspase-3 into the active, proapoptotic signal caspase-3 (Yang et al., 2013Yang C.F. Chiang M.C. Gray D.C. Prabhakaran M. Alvarado M. Juntti S.A. Unger E.K. Wells J.A. Shah N.M. Sexually dimorphic neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus govern mating in both sexes and aggression in males.Cell. 2013; 153: 896-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). PV-positive cells were greatly diminished in the AAV-FLEX-taCasp3-TEVp-injected striatum as compared to the contralateral control striatum (3 ± 1 versus 56 ± 6 PV-positive dorsal striatal neurons per section; n = 7 mice; Figures 3B and 3C). As a positive control that this manipulation could eliminate monosynaptic inhibition from FSI onto MSN, we injected PV-Cre mice with bilateral AAV1-DIO-ChR2-YFP and unilateral AAV1-FLEX-taCasp3-TEVp. Slices contralateral to AAV1-FLEX-taCasp3-TEVp injection showed expression of ChR2-YFP in PV-positive putative FSI (Figure S3B), while in ipsilateral slices very few PV-positive neurons were detected (Figures 3B, 3C, and S3A); most of these remaining neurons expressed ChR2-YFP. Presumed monosynaptic FSI-mediated IPSCs were large in control slices (5,880 ± 530 pA; n = 7) but negligible in caspase-treated slices (30 ± 8 pA; n = 13, n = 3 mice; p = 0.0001; Figure 3C), demonstrating that near-complete elimination of PV neurons resulted in near-complete loss of the FSI-mediated IPSC in MSNs. To determine whether elimination of PV-positive neurons and their input onto MSNs would likewise reduce the disynaptic IPSC derived from activation of cholinergic interneurons, we injected AAV1-FLEX-taCasp3-TEVp unilaterally in ChAT-ChR2::PV-Cre mice. In these mice, ChR2 is expressed constitutively in cholinergic interneurons (Zhao et al., 2011Zhao S. Ting J.T. Atallah H.E. Qiu L. Tan J. Gloss B. Augustine G.J. Deisseroth K. Luo M. Graybiel A.M. Feng G. Cell type–specific channelrhodopsin-2 transgenic mice for optogenetic dissection of neural circuitry function.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ablation of PV-positive neurons (Figures 3B and 3D) did not significantly alter light-evoked disynaptic IPSCs (1,110 ± 370 pA; n = 18 neurons/n = 4 mice in the injected hemisphere versus 960 ± 340 pA; n = 13 neurons/n = 4 mice in the untreated hemisphere; p = 0.79; Figure 3D). These results demonstrate that FSIs are not required for disynaptic IPSCs and suggest that the majority of the fIPSC is derived from an alternate source of GABA. Given that (1) optogenetic activation of cholinergic interneurons can drive terminal dopamine release in the striatum (Cachope et al., 2012Cachope R. Mateo Y. Mathur B.N. Irving J. Wang H.L.

To test this hypothesis, we compared disynaptic IPSCs in slices from animals treated unilaterally with saline (control) or the dopaminergic neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Degeneration of dopaminergic axons ipsilateral to the injection was confirmed by post hoc tyrosine hydroxylase staining (Figure 4A). 6-OHDA treatment resulted in markedly reduced light-evoked IPSCs (170 ± 40 pA, n = 14 neurons/n = 4 mice) as compared to saline treatment (Figures 4B and 4C; 1,610 ± 410 pA, n = 10 neurons/n = 3 mice, p = 0.0006). This result suggests that the fIPSC triggered by activation of cholinergic interneurons depends on the integrity of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. To further investigate whether depletion of neurotransmitter from dopamine terminals alters IPSC amplitude, we compared disynaptic IPSCs in slices from mice treated with the VMAT inhibitor reserpine and interleaved control mice. Although a provocative finding, a prior study showed that inhibition of VMAT prevented dopamine and GABA release from striatal dopamine terminals (Tritsch et al., 2012Tritsch N.X. Ding J.B. Sabatini B.L. Dopaminergic neurons inhibit striatal output through non-canonical release of GABA.Nature. 2012; 490: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). We found markedly reduced IPSC amplitudes in reserpine-treated mice (240 ± 40 pA, n = 19; n = 3 mice) compared to interleaved control mice (Figures 4B and 4C; 1,760 ± 90 pA, n = 14; n = 5 mice; p = 0.0001), indicating that IPSCs depend on VMAT. Surprisingly, 6-OHDA and reserpine treatment resulted in reductions of both fast and slow IPSC components: neuropeptide Y-expressing neurogliaform (NPY-NGF) neurons contribute prominently to the sIPSC (English et al., 2012English D.F. Ibanez-Sandoval O. Stark E. Tecuapetla F. Buzsáki G. Deisseroth K. Tepper J.M. Koos T. GABAergic circuits mediate the reinforcement-related signals of striatal cholinergic interneurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 123-130Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Suspecting that the chronicity of 6-OHDA and reserpine treatment might lead to striatal microcircuit reorganization and downregulation of the NPY-NGF-mediated sIPSC, we next used the more rapid-acting VMAT inhibitors Ro4-1284 and tetrabenazine (TBZ). These two agents were administered either in vivo immediately before slicing (Ro4-1284) or ex vivo to slices (TBZ). Acute Ro4-1284 treatment also reduced the amplitude of disynaptic IPSCs (670 ± 170 pA; n = 13 neurons/n = 2 mice) as compared to Ro4-1284 treatment followed by artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) wash for at least 1 hr (Figures 4B and 4C; 1,840 ± 360 pA; n = 12 neurons/n = 2 mice; p = 0.006) but left a substantial residual sIPSC. TBZ treatment decreased IPSC amplitude (740 ± 130 pA; n = 7 neurons/n = 3 mice) compared to interleaved controls (Figures 4B and 4C; 2,570 ± 770 pA; n = 9 neurons/n = 3 mice; p = 0.04), also leaving a residual sIPSC (decay tau 152 ± 26 ms). To verify that the decreased amplitude of IPSCs was not due to loss of dopamine-mediated neuromodulation of the IPSC itself, we applied a cocktail of D1 and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists (SCH23390, 1 μM; sulpiride, 10 μM) to control slices. Dopamine antagonists did not significantly alter IPSC amplitude (Figure 4B; 94% ± 8% of control, n = 6; p = 0.54). Together, these findings strongly suggest that dopaminergic terminals provide a major source of the GABA underlying fast disynaptic IPSCs seen in MSNs after stimulation of cholinergic interneurons, as schematized in Figure 4D. We have demonstrated that optogenetic activation of striatal cholinergic neurons triggers a disynaptic inhibitory synaptic response in MSNs, mediated in large part by nicotinic activation of GABA release from dopamine terminals. Surprisingly, parvalbumin-positive FSIs, a major source of GABAergic inputs to MSNs, are not required. As this phenomenon is TTX insensitive, and axons are the only portion of dopamine neurons present in our preparation, acetylcholine appears to trigger striatal GABA release via an action-potential-independent axoaxonic mechanism. These findings link prior studies showing (1) inhibitory responses in MSNs driven by optogenetic activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons, (2) inhibitory responses in MSNs driven by optogenetic activation of striatal dopamine terminals, and (3) dopamine release driven by optogenetic activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons and provide a mechanism by which striatal cholinergic interneurons may potently influence striatal output by dual control of dopamine and GABA release. One potential caveat of our study and others using BAC transgenic animals for optical control of cholinergic neurons is that ChAT-ChR2 mice have recently been found to have elevated ACh release and cognitive deficits due to overexpression of vesicular ACh transporters (Kolisnyk et al., 2013Kolisnyk B. Guzman M.S. Raulic S. Fan J. Magalhães A.C. Feng G. Gros R. Prado V.F. Prado M.A. ChAT-ChR2-EYFP mice have enhanced motor endurance but show deficits in attention and several additional cognitive domains.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 10427-10438Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Increased ACh release may enhance the amplitude of ACh-dependent responses but is unlikely to alter the overall mechanisms that we have outlined. The finding that fast GABAergic currents in MSNs derive from dopamine terminals is intriguing. Though dopamine axon terminals do not always form traditional tight axodendritic synapses onto MSNs (Descarries et al., 1996Descarries L. Watkins K.C. Garcia S. Bosler O. Doucet G. Dual character, asynaptic and synaptic, of the dopamine innervation in adult rat neostriatum: a quantitative autoradiographic and immunocytochemical analysis.J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 375: 167-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), they do form a relatively uniform and dense lattice of inputs in the dorsal striatum (Hanley and Bolam, 1997Hanley J.J. Bolam J.P. Synaptology of the nigrostriatal projection in relation to the compartmental organization of the neostriatum in the rat.Neuroscience. 1997; 81: 353-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and dopamine may influence postsynaptic targets over a broad area encompassing tens of thousands of synapses (Rice and Cragg, 2008Rice M.E. Cragg S.J. Dopamine spillover after quantal release: rethinking dopamine transmission in the nigrostriatal pathway.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2008; 58: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Terminal GABA release may also operate via volume transmission or, alternatively, the IPSCs we observe may arise from GABA release at dopamine terminals that are located proximal to GABAergic synapses. Optogenetics provide a tool for synchronous selective activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons, but prior anatomical and physiological studies have outlined much of the signaling substrate. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors reside on dopaminergic axon terminals (Jones et al., 2001Jones I.W. Bolam J.P. Wonnacott S. Presynaptic localisation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor beta2 subunit immunoreactivity in rat nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurones.J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 439: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, Threlfell et al., 2010Threlfell S. Clements M.A. Khodai T. Pienaar I.S. Exley R. Wess J. Cragg S.J. Striatal muscarinic receptors promote activity dependence of dopamine transmission via distinct receptor subtypes on cholinergic interneurons in ventral versus dorsal striatum.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 3398-3408Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), providing the anatomical means for acetylcholine to drive the release of dopamine (and GABA) from axon terminals in the striatum. In addition, the regulation of dopamine release by nicotinic receptors has been demonstrated directly (Rice and Cragg, 2004Rice M.E. Cragg S.J. Nicotine amplifies reward-related dopamine signals in striatum.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 583-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, Zhang and Sulzer, 2004Zhang H. Sulzer D. Frequency-dependent modulation of dopamine release by nicotine.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 581-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, Zhou et al., 2001Zhou F.M. Liang Y. Dani J.A. Endogenous nicotinic cholinergic activity regulates dopamine release in the striatum.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1224-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). These studies have shown that while phasic cholinergic stimulation can cause dopamine release, more prolonged stimulation results in nicotinic receptor desensitization and reduced release, which may be responsible for many of the behavioral pharmacology results obtained with nicotinic agents in vivo. By allowing precisely timed, synchronous release of acetylcholine and subsequent stimulation of nicotinic receptors, optogenetic strategies have facilitated detecting phasic responses in the striatum, which appear to be opposite in polarity to those seen with more tonic manipulations of acetylcholine. Despite evidence that cholinergic signaling is critical for striatal behaviors, how cholinergic interneurons alter striatal output is unclear. Spontaneously firing cholinergic interneurons receive strong excitatory thalamic input, which carries cue-related information, and inhibitory inputs from midbrain GABAergic neurons (Brown et al., 2012Brown M.T. Tan K.R. O’Connor E.C. Nikonenko I. Muller D. Lüscher C. Ventral tegmental area GABA projections pause accumbal cholinergic interneurons to enhance associative learning.Nature. 2012; 492: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In many in vivo studies, cholinergic neurons display a burst-pause-burst pattern of firing during relevant cues in the context of learned tasks. Cholinergic neurons send their projections widely throughout the striatum, influencing most striatal neurons through muscarinic or nicotinic receptors. Nicotinic receptor activation may have distinct phasic and tonic effects on MSNs due to the prominent desensitization of many nicotinic subtypes. The stereotyped burst-pause-burst firing pattern of cholinergic neurons could allow for (1) a window of relief from desensitization and (2) a more concerted modulation of MSN firing by release of fast-acting GABA and longer-acting dopamine during the burst. Afterward, spontaneous firing of cholinergic interneurons could again result in nicotinic desensitization and reduced dopamine and GABA release. These same processes may also influence the cholinergic interneurons themselves, given the proximity of dopamine terminals and cholinergic interneurons. While the significance of each of these mechanisms to the function of striatal cholinergic interneurons in vivo is not yet known, the ability of these neurons to recruit both dopamine and GABA release to modulate striatal output is likely to significantly contribute to their influence of basal ganglia function. Detailed methods are in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Hemizygous ChAT-Cre mice (line GM60, GENSAT) were bred against either wild-type C57Bl/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory) or Drd1a-tdTomato mice (Nicole Calakos, Duke University) to yield ChAT-Cre or ChAT-Cre:Drd1a-tdTomato mice. Hemizygous ChAT-ChR2 mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were crossed to Parvalbumin-2A-Cre mice (The Jackson Laboratory) to yield ChAT-ChR2:PV-Cre mice. Mice of either sex were used. Virus was stereotactically injected in the dorsal striatum of mice through a small hole in the skull. Mice returned to their home cages for 2–4 weeks prior to histology or physiology. Some mice were later reanesthetized and injected with either the toxin 6-hydroxydopamine or normal saline in the medial forebrain bundle. Mice were deeply anesthetized prior to removing the brain and preparing 300 μm coronal slices. Slices were stored in carbogenated ACSF at room temperature (RT) and then transferred to a recording chamber superfused with carbogenated ACSF at 31°C–33°C. Neurons were patched in the dorsal striatum in whole-cell mode, and ChR2 or eNpHR3.0 was activated with light pulses delivered through the microscope objective. With the exception of carbachol, which was pressure ejected from a glass pipet, drugs were administered in the circulating ACSF. A subset of mice was deeply anesthetized, perfused, and fixed. Brains were removed, cryoprotected, frozen, and cut into 30 μm coronal sections. Primary antibody (Millipore AB144P Anti-ChAT 1:500, SWANT Anti-parvalbumin 1:1,000, or Pel-Freez P40101 Anti-Tyrosine Hydroxylase 1:1,000) was added in 5% NDS, 1% Triton in PBS and incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing, slices were incubated with Alexa Fluor 649-conjugated donkey anti-goat or donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 2 hr at RT. All data are presented as the mean ± SEM.

https://openalex.org/W2017363253,"Although mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is prone to mutation and few mtDNA repair mechanisms exist, crippling mitochondrial mutations are exceedingly rare. Recent studies have demonstrated strong purifying selection in the mouse female germline. However, the mechanisms underlying positive selection of healthy mitochondria remain to be elucidated. We visualized mtDNA replication during Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis, finding that mtDNA replication commenced before oocyte determination during the late germarium stage and was dependent on mitochondrial fitness. We isolated a temperature-sensitive lethal mtDNA allele, mt:CoI(T300I), which resulted in reduced mtDNA replication in the germarium at the restrictive temperature. Additionally, the frequency of the mt:CoI(T300I) allele in heteroplasmic flies was decreased, both during oogenesis and over multiple generations, at the restrictive temperature. Furthermore, we determined that selection against mt:CoI(T300I) overlaps with the timing of selective replication of mtDNA in the germarium. These findings establish a previously uncharacterized developmental mechanism for the selective amplification of wild-type mtDNA, which may be evolutionarily conserved to limit the transmission of deleterious mutations."

These cells form a functional map of external space already at the time when rat pups leave the nest for the first time in their life, at the age of 2.5 weeks. However, while place cells have adult-like firing fields from the outset, grid cells have irregular and variable fields until the fourth week, raising doubts about their contribution to place cell firing at young age. Recording in MEC of juvenile rats, we show that, unlike grid cells, border cells express adult-like firing fields from the first days of exposure to an open environment, at postnatal days 16-18. Thus, spatial signals from border cells may be sufficient to maintain spatially localized firing in juvenile hippocampal place cells."

This trial enrolled 92 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and lipid abnormalities randomized into 2 arms, each arm comprising 46 participants. Of the participants, 39 in therapeutic arm took 500 mg green tea extract, three times a day, while 38 in control arm took cellulose with the same dose and frequency to complete the 16-week study. Anthropometrics measurements, glycemic and lipid profiles, safety parameters, and obesity-related hormone peptides were analyzed at screening and after 16-week course. Within-group comparisons showed that green tea extract caused a significant decrease in triglyceride and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index after 16 weeks. Green tea extract also increased significantly high density lipoprotein cholesterol. The HOMA-IR index decreased from 5.4±3.9 to 3.5±2.0 in therapeutic arm only. Adiponectin, apolipoprotein A1, and apolipoprotein B100 increased significantly in both arms, but only glucagon-like peptide 1 increased in the therapeutic arm. However, only decreasing trend in triglyceride was found in between-group comparison. Our study suggested that green tea extract significantly improved insulin resistance and increased glucagon-like peptide 1 only in within-group comparison. The potential effects of green tea extract on insulin resistance and glucagon-like peptide 1 warrant further investigation. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01360567"
https://openalex.org/W2086492737,"Augmenting BDNF/TrkB signaling has been demonstrated to be a promising strategy for reversing cognitive deficits in preclinical models of Alzheimer disease (AD). Although these studies highlight the potential of targeting BDNF/TrkB signaling, this strategy has not yet been tested in a model that develops the disease features that are most closely associated with cognitive decline in AD: severe synaptic and neuronal loss. In the present study, we investigated the impact of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF), a TrkB agonist, in CaM/Tet-DTA mice, an inducible model of severe neuronal loss in the hippocampus and cortex. Systemic 7,8-DHF treatment significantly improved spatial memory in lesioned mice, as measured by water maze. Analysis of GFP-labeled neurons in CaM/Tet-DTA mice revealed that 7,8-DHF induced a significant and selective increase in the density of thin spines in CA1 of lesioned mice, without affecting mushroom or stubby spines. These findings suggest chronic upregulation of TrkB signaling with 7,8-DHF may be an effective and practical strategy for improving function in AD, even after substantial neuronal loss has occurred."
https://openalex.org/W2010675523,"It is not known how selection affects mutations in the multiple copies of the mitochondrial genome. We transferred cytoplasm between D. melanogaster embryos carrying mitochondrial mutations to create heteroplasmic lines transmitting two mitochondrial genotypes. Increased temperature imposed selection against a temperature-sensitive mutation affecting cytochrome oxidase, driving decreases in the abundance of the mutant genome over successive generations. Selection did not influence the health or fertility of the flies but acted during midoogenesis to influence competition between the genomes. Mitochondria might incur an advantage through selective localization, survival or proliferation, yet timing and insensitivity to park mutation suggest that preferential proliferation underlies selection. Selection drove complete replacement of the temperature-sensitive mitochondrial genome by a wild-type genome but also stabilized the multigenerational transmission of two genomes carrying complementing detrimental mutations. While they are so balanced, these stably transmitted mutations have no detrimental phenotype, but their segregation could contribute to disease phenotypes and somatic aging."
https://openalex.org/W2042087684,"Invertebrate harvesting is an important livelihood in tropical settings providing income and food for numerous populations throughout the world. However, the lack of research, policy and management directed towards this livelihood hinders the analysis of time trends to evaluate invertebrate resources status. Another missing aspect is the consideration of gender analysis, i.e., the different roles and interests of men and women engaged in this activity. Based on interviews, catch assessments and inventories this multi-disciplinary study from Chwaka Bay (Zanzibar, Tanzania) shows how unregulated harvesting of invertebrates may result in sharp declines in animal abundance over a relatively short period of time (2005 to 2010), threatening the sustainability of the fishery. Specifically, the results show that catches in general, and prime target species of gastropods and bivalves in particular, had been significantly reduced in number and size. Interviews revealed gender disparities; female harvesters experienced less access to good fishing/collecting grounds and species of high value, which subsequently resulted in lower individual income. This is tightly linked to women's reproductive roles, which not only leads to limited mobility but also lessen their chances to accumulate livelihood assets (natural, physical, financial, social and human capital) thus impacting livelihood strategies. To protect invertebrate resources from overexploitation, and assure a constant flow of income and food for future generations, this case study illustrates the need for formal monitoring to assess changes in invertebrate resources, and possible ecological consequences, over time. Managers and policy-makers must also address gender to evaluate the contribution of all resource users, their capacity to cope with changing conditions, as well as specific interests."
https://openalex.org/W1970628480,"Most neuroimaging studies of resting state networks in amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) have concentrated on functional connectivity (FC) based on instantaneous correlation in a single network. The purpose of the current study was to investigate effective connectivity in aMCI patients based on Granger causality of four important networks at resting state derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging data – default mode network (DMN), hippocampal cortical memory network (HCMN), dorsal attention network (DAN) and fronto-parietal control network (FPCN). Structural and functional MRI data were collected from 16 aMCI patients and 16 age, gender-matched healthy controls. Correlation-purged Granger causality analysis was used, taking gray matter atrophy as covariates, to compare the group difference between aMCI patients and healthy controls. We found that the causal connectivity between networks in aMCI patients was significantly altered with both increases and decreases in the aMCI group as compared to healthy controls. Some alterations were significantly correlated with the disease severity as measured by mini-mental state examination (MMSE), and California verbal learning test (CVLT) scores. When the whole-brain signal averaged over the entire brain was used as a nuisance co-variate, the within-group maps were significantly altered while the between-group difference maps did not. These results suggest that the alterations in causal influences may be one of the possible underlying substrates of cognitive impairments in aMCI. The present study extends and complements previous FC studies and demonstrates the coexistence of causal disconnection and compensation in aMCI patients, and thus might provide insights into biological mechanism of the disease."

The medical records of these patients were retrospectively reviewed.A total of 91 patients with bacteremia due to Aeromonas species were identified. In addition to 16 (17.6%) primary bacteremia, the most common source of secondary infection is peritonitis (n = 27, 29.7%), followed by biliary tract infection (n = 18, 19.8%), and SSTI (n = 12, 13.2%), pneumonia (n = 9, 9.9%), catheter-related bloodstream infection (n = 5, 5.5%), and genitourinary tract infection (n = 4, 4.4%).

Forty-three (47.3%) patients were classified as healthcare-associated infections (HCAI) causes by Aeromonas species, and patients with HCAI were more likely to have cancer, and receive immunosuppressant than patients with community-acquired bacteremia. The overall outcomes, including rate of ICU admission, acute respiratory failure, and mortality were 33.3%, 28.6%, and 23.1%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that the in-hospital day mortality was significantly associated only with underlying cancer (P <.001), and initial shock (P <.001).Aeromonas species should be considered one of the causative pathogens of healthcare-associated bacteremia, especially in immunocompromised patients. In addition, it can be associated with high fatality. Cancer and initial shock were the poor prognostic factors."
https://openalex.org/W2041389505,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an enveloped DNA virus that replicates via reverse transcription of its pregenomic RNA (pgRNA). Budding of HBV is supposed to occur at intracellular membranes and requires scission functions of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) provided by ESCRT-III and VPS4. Here, we have investigated the impact of the upstream-acting ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II complexes in HBV morphogenesis. RNA interference knockdown of the ESCRT-I subunits TSG101 and VPS28 did not block, but rather stimulate virus release. In contrast, RNAi-mediated depletion of the ESCRT-II components EAP20, EAP30 and EAP45 greatly reduced virus egress. By analyzing different steps of the HBV maturation pathway, we find that the knockdown of ESCRT-II not only inhibited the production and/or release of enveloped virions, but also impaired intracellular nucleocapsid formation. Transcription/translation studies revealed that the depletion of ESCRT-II neither affected the synthesis and nuclear export of HBV-specific RNAs nor the expression of the viral core and envelope proteins. Moreover, the absence of ESCRT-II had no effects on the assembly capability and integrity of HBV core/capsids. However, the level of encapsidated pgRNA was significantly reduced in ESCRT-II-depleted cells, implicating that ESCRT-II directs steps accompanying the formation of replication-competent nucleocapsids, like e.g. assisting in RNA trafficking and encapsidation. In support of this, the capsid protein was found to interact and colocalize with ESCRT-II subunits in virus-producing cells. Together, these results indicate an essential role for ESCRT-II in the HBV life cycle and suggest that ESCRT-II functions prior to the final HBV budding reaction."

This protein has been approved for the treatment of various conditions, including hGH deficiency, chronic renal failure, and Turner syndrome. Efficient production of hGH in Escherichia coli (E. coli) has proven difficult because the E. coli-expressed hormone tends to aggregate and form inclusion bodies, resulting in poor solubility. In this study, seven N-terminal fusion partners, hexahistidine (His6), thioredoxin (Trx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), maltose-binding protein (MBP), N-utilization substance protein A (NusA), protein disulfide bond isomerase (PDI), and the b′a′ domain of PDI (PDIb′a′), were tested for soluble overexpression of codon-optimized hGH in E. coli. We found that MBP and hPDI tags significantly increased the solubility of the hormone. In addition, lowering the expression temperature to 18°C also dramatically increased the solubility of all the fusion proteins. We purified hGH from MBP-, PDIb′a′-, or Trx-tagged hGH expressed at 18°C in E. coli using simple chromatographic techniques and compared the final purity, yield, and activity of hGH to assess the impact of each partner protein. Purified hGH was highly pure on silver-stained gel and contained very low levels of endotoxin. On average, ∼37 mg, ∼12 mg, and ∼7 mg of hGH were obtained from 500 mL-cell cultures of Trx-hGH, MBP-hGH, and PDIb′a′-hGH, respectively. Subsequently, hGH was analyzed using mass spectroscopy to confirm the presence of two intra-molecular disulfide bonds. The bioactivity of purified hGHs was demonstrated using Nb2-11 cell."
https://openalex.org/W1990403218,"Pulmonary vascular remodeling and increased arterial wall stiffness are two major causes for the elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure in patients and animals with pulmonary hypertension. Cellular copper (Cu) plays an important role in angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling; increased Cu in vascular smooth muscle cells has been demonstrated to be associated with atherosclerosis and hypertension in animal experiments. In this study, we show that the Cu-uptake transporter 1, CTR1, and the Cu-efflux pump, ATP7A, were both upregulated in the lung tissues and pulmonary arteries of mice with hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. Hypoxia also significantly increased expression and activity of lysyl oxidase (LOX), a Cu-dependent enzyme that causes crosslinks of collagen and elastin in the extracellular matrix. In vitro experiments show that exposure to hypoxia or treatment with cobalt (CoCl2) also increased protein expression of CTR1, ATP7A, and LOX in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC). In PASMC exposed to hypoxia or treated with CoCl2, we also confirmed that the Cu transport is increased using 64Cu uptake assays. Furthermore, hypoxia increased both cell migration and proliferation in a Cu-dependent manner. Downregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) with siRNA significantly attenuated hypoxia-mediated upregulation of CTR1 mRNA. In summary, the data from this study indicate that increased Cu transportation due to upregulated CTR1 and ATP7A in pulmonary arteries and PASMC contributes to the development of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. The increased Cu uptake and elevated ATP7A also facilitate the increase in LOX activity and thus the increase in crosslink of extracellular matrix, and eventually leading to the increase in pulmonary arterial stiffness."

This 2-year prospective study aimed to describe patterns and predictors of adverse reactions to first-line ART and assess the impact of these events on treatment success.Between 2010-2013, 321 ART-naïve eligible adults were enrolled at two clinics in southern India. ART regimens included zidovudine or stavudine plus lamivudine, plus nevirapine or efavirenz. Pill count adherence, immunological and virological monitoring, and laboratory-based adverse drug reactions were measured prospectively and analyzed.Among 321 patients in the study, 289 (90.0%) patients experienced at least 1 adverse reaction, and 85 (26.5%) experienced at least 1 severe reaction. The incidence rate was 52 and 15 per 100 person-years for all reactions and severe reactions respectively. The cumulative incidence of zidovudine-induced anemia was 37.1% over 2 years. At 12 and 24 months, the proportion of patients with optimal adherence, undetectable viral load and CD4 counts >350 cells/mm3 were similar between patients who experienced or did not experience severe adverse drug reactions.Our results highlight the high frequency of ART-related adverse drug reactions among individuals initiating first-line ART in India, underscoring the importance of detailed counseling and monitoring for maintaining ART durability. Severe drug-induced anemia needs to be addressed urgently with alternative first-line agents, and close laboratory surveillance. High treatment efficacy despite decreased drug safety seen here may be because patients have limited treatment options.

Here, we demonstrate that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) db/db mice exhibited hippocampus-dependent memory impairment, which might associate with a reduction in dendritic spine density in the pyramidal neurons of brain, Aβ1-42 deposition in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus, and a decreased expression of neurostructural proteins including microtubule-associated protein (MAP2), a marker of dendrites, and postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95), a marker of excitatory synapses. To investigate the effects of the ZiBuPiYin recipe (ZBPYR), a traditional Chinese medicine recipe, on diabetes-related cognitive decline (DACD), db/db mice received daily administration of ZBPYR over an experimental period of 6 weeks. We then confirmed that ZBPYR rescued learning and memory performance impairments, reversed dendritic spine loss, reduced Aβ1-42 deposition and restored the expression levels of MAP2 and PSD95. The present study also revealed that ZBPYR strengthened brain leptin and insulin signaling and inhibited GSK3β overactivity, which may be the potential mechanism or underlying targets of ZBPYR. These findings conclude that ZBPYR prevents DACD, most likely by improving dendritic spine density and attenuating brain leptin and insulin signaling pathway injury. Our findings provide further evidence for the effects of ZBPYR on DACD."
https://openalex.org/W2029835962,"An attractive approach to replace the destroyed insulin-producing cells (IPCs) is the generation of functional β cells from stem cells. Embryonal carcinoma (EC) stem cells are pluripotent cells which can differentiate into all cell types. The present study was carried out to establish a simple nonselective inductive culture system for generation of IPCs from P19 EC cells by 1-2 weeks old mouse pancreas extract (MPE). Since, mouse pancreatic islets undergo further remodeling and maturation for 2-3 weeks after birth, we hypothesized that the mouse neonatal MPE contains essential factors to induce in vitro differentiation of pancreatic lineages. Pluripotency of P19 cells were first confirmed by expression analysis of stem cell markers, Oct3/4, Sox-2 and Nanog. In order to induce differentiation, the cells were cultured in a medium supplemented by different concentrations of MPE (50, 100, 200 and 300 µg/ml). The results showed that P19 cells could differentiate into IPCs and form dithizone-positive cell clusters. The generated P19-derived IPCs were immunoreactive to proinsulin, insulin and insulin receptor beta. The expression of pancreatic β cell genes including, PDX-1, INS1 and INS2 were also confirmed. The peak response at the 100 µg/ml MPE used for investigation of EP300 and CREB1 gene expression. When stimulated with glucose, these cells synthesized and secreted insulin. Network analysis of the key transcription factors (PDX-1, EP300, CREB1) during the generation of IPCs resulted in introduction of novel regulatory candidates such as MIR17, and VEZF1 transcription factors, as well as MORN1, DKFZp761P0212, and WAC proteins. Altogether, we demonstrated the possibility of generating IPCs from undifferentiated EC cells, with the characteristics of pancreatic β cells. The derivation of pancreatic cells from EC cells which are ES cell siblings would provide a valuable experimental tool in study of pancreatic development and function as well as rapid production of IPCs for transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W1978977517,"Most mushrooms are thermo-sensitive to temperatures over 23°C, which greatly restricts their agricultural cultivation. Understanding mushroom’s innate heat-tolerance mechanisms may facilitate genetic improvements of their thermotolerance. Agaricus bisporus strain 02 is a relatively thermotolerant mushroom strain, while strain 8213 is quite thermo-sensitive. Here, we compared their responses at proteomic level to heat treatment at 33°C. We identified 73 proteins that are differentially expressed between 02 and 8213 or induced upon heat stress in strain 02 itself, 48 of which with a known identity. Among them, 4 proteins are constitutively more highly expressed in 02 than 8213; and they can be further upregulated in response to heat stress in 02, but not in 8213. One protein is encoded by the para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) synthase gene Pabs, which has been shown to scavenge the reactive oxygen species in vitro. Pabs mRNA and its chemical product PABA show similar heat stress induction pattern as PABA synthase protein and are more abundant in 02, indicating transcriptional level upregulation of Pabs upon heat stress. A specific inhibitor of PABA synthesis impaired thermotolerance of 02, while exogenous PABA or transgenic overexpression of 02 derived PABA synthase enhanced thermotolerance of 8213. Furthermore, compared to 8213, 02 accumulated less H2O2 but more defense-related proteins (e.g., HSPs and Chitinase) under heat stress. Together, these results demonstrate a role of PABA in enhancing mushroom thermotolerance by removing H2O2 and elevating defense-related proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2012034954,"The association between attachment and mental health symptoms in adolescents in a post-conflict low resource setting has not been documented.We investigated the relationship between parent and peer attachment and posttraumatic stress, depression and anxiety symptoms in a sample of 551 adolescents aged 13-21 years old. Attachment quality was assessed using the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA). Post-traumatic stress, depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Impact of Events Scale Revised (IESR) and Hopkins Symptom Checklist for Adolescents (HSCL-37A) respectively. Gender differences in attachment relationships were determined using independent t-tests. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess whether attachment relationships were independently associated with posttraumatic stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted to explore the moderating role of war-related trauma.Our analyses revealed gender differences in attachment to parents, with males reporting stronger attachment than females. Parental attachment was protective against depression and anxiety symptoms but not posttraumatic stress symptoms after adjusting for potential confounders. Alienation by parents was independently associated with an increase in these mental health symptoms while peer attachment was not associated with any of these symptoms. However, in situations of severe trauma, our analyses showed that peer attachment was significantly protective against post-traumatic stress symptoms.Secure parental attachment is associated with better psychosocial adjustment in adolescents affected by war. Further, adolescents with secure peer attachment relationships in situations of severe war trauma may be less likely to develop posttraumatic stress symptoms. Interventions to enhance peer support in this post conflict setting would benefit this vulnerable population."
https://openalex.org/W2031187373,"Chronic lung infections due to the persistence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients are typically associated with the emergence of antibiotic resistance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the emergence of carbapenem resistance when a clinical isolate of P. aeruginosa collected from a patient with cystic fibrosis was challenged with meropenem. Nine carbapenem-resistant mutants were selected with subinhibitory concentrations of meropenem from a clinical isolate of P. aeruginosa and characterized for carbapenem resistance. Increased carbapenem MICs were associated with the identification of the novel insertion sequence ISPa8 within oprD or its promoter region in all the mutants. The position of ISPa8 was different for each of the mutants evaluated. In addition, Southern blot analyses identified multiple copies of ISPa8 within the genomes of the mutants and their parent isolate. These data demonstrate that transposition of IS elements within the Pseudomonas genome can influence antibiotic susceptibility. Understanding the selective pressures associated with the emergence of antibiotic resistance is critical for the judicious use of antimicrobial chemotherapy and the successful treatment of bacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W2063193343,"Background Tumor cell invasion into the surrounding matrix has been well documented as an early event of metastasis occurrence. However, the dynamic expression patterns of proteins during early invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are largely unknown. Using a three-dimensional HCC invasion culture model established previously, we investigated the dynamic expression patterns of identified proteins during early invasion of HCC. Materials and Methods Highly metastatic MHCC97H cells and a liver tissue fragment were long-term co-cultured in a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor to simulate different pathological states of HCC invasion. The established spherical co-cultures were collected on days 0, 5, 10, and 15 for dynamic expression pattern analysis. Significantly different proteins among spheroids at different time points were screened and identified using quantitative proteomics of iTRAQ labeling coupled with LC–MS/MS. Dynamic expression patterns of differential proteins were further categorized by K-means clustering. The expression modes of several differentially expressed proteins were confirmed by Western blot and qRT–PCR. Results Time course analysis of invasion/metastasis gene expressions (MMP2, MMP7, MMP9, CD44, SPP1, CXCR4, CXCL12, and CDH1) showed remarkable, dynamic alterations during the invasion process of HCC. A total of 1,028 proteins were identified in spherical co-cultures collected at different time points by quantitative proteomics. Among these proteins, 529 common differential proteins related to HCC invasion were clustered into 25 types of expression patterns. Some proteins displayed significant dynamic alterations during the early invasion process of HCC, such as upregulation at the early invasion stage and downregulation at the late invasion stage (e.g., MAPRE1, PHB2, cathepsin D, etc.) or continuous upregulation during the entire invasion process (e.g., vitronectin, Met, clusterin, ICAM1, GSN, etc.). Conclusions Dynamic expression patterns of candidate proteins during the early invasion process of HCC facilitate the discovery of new molecular targets for early intervention to prevent HCC invasion and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2143048451,"The serum amyloid A (SAA) protein is known to function in the acute phase response and immunoregulation. Recently, SAA has been shown to be involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and migratory behavior in different cell types. Here, we evaluated whether exogenous SAA could influence trophoblast invasion and differentiation using both the trophoblast-like BeWo cell line and fully differentiated human extravillous trophoblast cells (EVT) isolated from term placentae. SAA stimulated BeWo cell invasion, as measured in Matrigel invasion assays, and induced metalloprotease mRNA expression and activity. Given that BeWo cells express Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a known receptor for SAA, we examined the role of TLR4 in SAA-induced invasion using a TLR4 neutralizing antibody. We also tested whether SAA could affect markers of trophoblast syncytialization in BeWo cells. We observed that SAA decreased βhCG secretion and did not influence trophoblast syncytialization. Using EVT cells isolated from human term basal plates, we confirmed that SAA at 1 and 10 µg/mL doubled EVT invasion in a TLR4-dependent manner, but at 20 µg/mL inhibited EVT cells invasiveness. In addition, we observed that SAA was expressed in both BeWo cells and human term placentae, specifically in the syncytiotrophoblast, decidual cells and EVT. In conclusion, SAA was identified as a molecule that functions in the placental microenvironment to regulate metalloprotease activity and trophoblast invasion, which are key processes in placentation and placental homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2042102933,"Understanding and predicting species distribution in space and time and consequently community structure and dynamics is an important issue in ecology, and particularly in climate change research. A crucial factor determining the composition and dynamics of animal populations is habitat heterogeneity, i.e., the number of structural elements in a given locality. In the marine pelagic environment habitat heterogeneity is represented by the distribution of physical oceanographic parameters such as temperature, salinity and oxygen that are closely linked to atmospheric conditions. Little attention has been given, however, to the role of habitat heterogeneity in modulating the response of animal communities to external climate forcing. Here we investigate the long-term dynamics of Acartia spp., Temora longicornis, and Pseudocalanus acuspes, three dominant zooplankton species inhabiting different pelagic habitats in the Central Baltic Sea (CBS). We use the three copepods as indicator species for changes in the CBS zooplankton community and apply non-linear statistical modeling techniques to compare spatial population trends and to identify their drivers. We demonstrate that effects of climate variability and change depend strongly on species-specific habitat utilization, being more direct and pronounced at the upper water layer. We propose that the differential functional response to climate-related drivers in relation to strong habitat segregation is due to alterations of the species' environmental niches. We stress the importance of understanding how anticipated climate change will affect ecological niches and habitats in order to project spatio-temporal changes in species abundance and distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2119138966,"Background Gene variants known to contribute to Autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD) susceptibility include those at the MHC, MICA, CIITA, CTLA4, PTPN22, CYP27B1, NLRP-1 and CD274 loci. The majority of the genetic component to disease susceptibility has yet to be accounted for. Aim To investigate the role of 19 candidate genes in AAD susceptibility in six European case-control cohorts. Methods A sequential association study design was employed with genotyping using Sequenom iPlex technology. In phase one, 85 SNPs in 19 genes were genotyped in UK and Norwegian AAD cohorts (691 AAD, 715 controls). In phase two, 21 SNPs in 11 genes were genotyped in German, Swedish, Italian and Polish cohorts (1264 AAD, 1221 controls). In phase three, to explore association of GATA3 polymorphisms with AAD and to determine if this association extended to other autoimmune conditions, 15 SNPs in GATA3 were studied in UK and Norwegian AAD cohorts, 1195 type 1 diabetes patients from Norway, 650 rheumatoid arthritis patients from New Zealand and in 283 UK Graves' disease patients. Meta-analysis was used to compare genotype frequencies between the participating centres, allowing for heterogeneity. Results We report significant association with alleles of two STAT4 markers in AAD cohorts (rs4274624: P = 0.00016; rs10931481: P = 0.0007). In addition, nominal association of AAD with alleles at GATA3 was found in 3 patient cohorts and supported by meta-analysis. Association of AAD with CYP27B1 alleles was also confirmed, which replicates previous published data. Finally, nominal association was found at SNPs in both the NF-κB1 and IL23A genes in the UK and Italian cohorts respectively. Conclusions Variants in the STAT4 gene, previously associated with other autoimmune conditions, confer susceptibility to AAD. Additionally, we report association of GATA3 variants with AAD: this adds to the recent report of association of GATA3 variants with rheumatoid arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W1979590231,"During food consumption the brain integrates multiple interrelated neural and hormonal signals involved in the regulation of food intake. Factors influencing the decision to stop eating include the foods' sensory properties, macronutrient content, and volume, which in turn affect gastric distention and appetite hormone responses. So far, the contributions of gastric distention and oral stimulation by food on brain activation have not been studied. The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of gastric distention with an intra-gastric load and the additional effect of oral stimulation on brain activity after food administration. Our secondary objective was to study the correlations between hormone responses and appetite-related ratings and brain activation. Fourteen men completed three functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions during which they either received a naso-gastric infusion of water (stomach distention), naso-gastric infusion of chocolate milk (stomach distention + nutrients), or ingested chocolate-milk (stomach distention + nutrients + oral exposure). Appetite ratings and blood parameters were measured at several time points. During gastric infusion, brain activation was observed in the midbrain, amygdala, hypothalamus, and hippocampus for both chocolate milk and water, i.e., irrespective of nutrient content. The thalamus, amygdala, putamen and precuneus were activated more after ingestion than after gastric infusion of chocolate milk, whereas infusion evoked greater activation in the hippocampus and anterior cingulate. Moreover, areas involved in gustation and reward were activated more after oral stimulation. Only insulin responses following naso-gastric infusion of chocolate milk correlated with brain activation, namely in the putamen and insula. In conclusion, we show that normal (oral) food ingestion evokes greater activation than gastric infusion in stomach distention and food intake-related brain areas. This provides neural evidence for the importance of sensory stimulation in the process of satiation.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01644539."
https://openalex.org/W1985312069,"Yeast Pichia anomala strain Kh6 Kurtzman (Saccharomycetales: Endomycetaceae) exhibits biological control properties that provide an alternative to the chemical fungicides currently used by fruit or vegetable producers against main post-harvest pathogens, such as Botrytis cinerea (Helotiales: Sclerotiniaceae). Using an in situ model that takes into account interactions between organisms and a proteomic approach, we aimed to identify P. anomala metabolic pathways influenced by the presence of B. cinerea. A total of 105 and 60 P. anomala proteins were differentially represented in the exponential and stationary growth phases, respectively. In the exponential phase and in the presence of B. cinerea, the pentose phosphate pathway seems to be enhanced and would provide P. anomala with the needed nucleic acids and energy for the wound colonisation. In the stationary phase, P. anomala would use alcoholic fermentation both in the absence and presence of the pathogen. These results would suggest that the competitive colonisation of apple wounds could be implicated in the mode of action of P. anomala against B. cinerea."
https://openalex.org/W1997771363,"Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) causes central nervous system damage and neurobehavioral disorders, and sevoflurane protects the brain from ischemic injury. We investigated the effects of sevoflurane on EMP-induced brain injury. Rats were exposed to EMP and immediately treated with sevoflurane. The protective effects of sevoflurane were assessed by Nissl staining, Fluoro-Jade C staining and electron microscopy. The neurobehavioral effects were assessed using the open-field test and the Morris water maze. Finally, primary cerebral cortical neurons were exposed to EMP and incubated with different concentration of sevoflurane. The cellular viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) level were assayed. TUNEL staining was performed, and the expression of apoptotic markers was determined. The cerebral cortexes of EMP-exposed rats presented neuronal abnormalities. Sevoflurane alleviated these effects, as well as the learning and memory deficits caused by EMP exposure. In vitro, cell viability was reduced and LDH release was increased after EMP exposure; treatment with sevoflurane ameliorated these effects. Additionally, sevoflurane increased SOD activity, decreased MDA levels and alleviated neuronal apoptosis by regulating the expression of cleaved caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2. These findings demonstrate that Sevoflurane conferred neuroprotective effects against EMP radiation-induced brain damage by inhibiting neuronal oxidative stress and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2015081930,"The prion protein gene (Prnp) is highly influential in determining risk and susceptibility of sheep exposed to classical scrapie. Sheep homozygous for alanine at codon 136 and arginine at codons 154 and 171 (ARR/ARR) of the Prnp gene are historically considered to be highly resistant to classical scrapie, although they form a significant fraction of cases of atypical scrapie. To date, experimental transmission of prions to ARR/ARR sheep has only been achieved with the BSE agent and mostly by the intracerebral route. We summarise here the results of six separate studies, in which 95 sheep of the ARR/ARR genotype were naturally exposed to (n = 18) or experimentally challenged with (n = 77) natural or experimental sources of classical scrapie by the oral, intra-intestinal, subcutaneous or intracerebral routes and allowed to survive for periods of up to 94 months post-infection. Only the intracerebral route resulted in disease and/or amplification of disease associated PrP (PrPd), and only in two of 19 sheep that survived for longer than 36 months. Discriminatory immunohistochemistry and Western blot confirmed the scrapie, non-BSE signature of PrPd in those two sheep. However, the neuropathological phenotype was different from any other scrapie (classical or atypical) or BSE source previously reported in sheep of any Prnp genotype. These studies confirm the widely held view that ARR/ARR sheep are highly resistant to classical scrapie infection, at least within their commercial lifespan. Moreover, within the constraints of the present studies (only two infected sheep), these results do not support the suggestion that atypical scrapie or BSE are generated by adaptation or mutation of classical scrapie in sheep of resistant ARR/ARR genotype."
https://openalex.org/W2034668444,"Objective We examined the association between occupational lifting during pregnancy and risk of fetal death and preterm birth using a job exposure matrix (JEM). Methods For 68,086 occupationally active women in the Danish National Birth Cohort, interview information on occupational lifting was collected around gestational week 16. We established a JEM based on information from women, who were still pregnant when interviewed. The JEM provided mean total loads lifted per day within homogeneous exposure groups as informed by job and industry codes. All women were assigned an exposure estimate from the JEM. We used Cox regression models with gestational age as underlying time variable and adjustment for covariates. Results We observed 2,717 fetal deaths and 3,128 preterm births within the study cohort. No exposure-response relation was observed for fetal death, but for women with a prior fetal death, we found a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.87 (95% CI 1.37, 6.01) for stillbirth (fetal death ≥22 completed gestational weeks) among those who lifted >200 kg/day. For preterm birth, we found an exposure-response relation for primigravid women, reaching a HR of 1.43 (95% CI 1.13, 1.80) for total loads >200 kg per day. These findings correspond to an excess fraction of 11% for stillbirth and 10% for preterm birth. Conclusion We found an increased risk of stillbirth among women with a prior fetal death, who lifted >200 kg/day, and an exposure-response relationship between occupational lifting and preterm birth among primigravid women. The study adds to a large body of prospective studies on occupational lifting and adverse pregnancy outcomes by refined exposure assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2083577280,"Objective To find the associations between diabetic retinopathy and age at diagnosis, C-peptide level and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level in Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods 3100 hospitalized type 2 diabetic patients in Peking University People's Hospital were included in this retrospective study. Their medical history and the laboratory data were collected. All the patients received examination of diabetic retinopathy (DR) by professional ophthalmologist. Results Comparisons among patients with NDR, NPDR and PDR showed that with the progression of diabetic retinopathy, patients turned to have older age but younger age at diagnosis of diabetes, and have higher SBP, longer duration of diabetes, higher mean HbA1c but lower fasting and 2 hours postprandial C-peptide level. Moreover, with the progression of diabetic retinopathy, patients turned to have higher prevalence of primary hypertension, higher prevalence of peripheral vascular sclerosis, higher proportion with insulin treatment. TSH level was comparable among the three groups of patients. Association analysis showed that after adjusting for age, sex, duration of diabetes, body mass index, HbA1c, blood pressure and albuminurea creatinine ratio and insulin treatment, age at diagnosis (OR 0.888, 95%CI 0.870–0.907, p = 0.00) and postprandial C-peptide (OR 0.920, 95%CI 0.859–0.937, p = 0.00) are the independent associated factors of DR in Chinese type 2 diabetes. Conclusions According to the results, postprandial C-peptide level and age at diabetes may be two independent associated factors with DR in Chinese type 2 diabetes. The lower level of postprandial C-peptide, the younger age at diagnosis, may indicate the higher prevalence of DR."

Following Z. aethiopica spathe tissue RNA extraction, high-throughput RNA sequencing was performed with the aim of obtaining both abundant and rare transcript data. Functional profiling based on KEGG Orthology (KO) analysis highlighted contigs that were involved predominantly in genetic information (37%) and metabolism (34%) processes. Predicted proteins involved in the plant circadian system, hormone signal transduction, secondary metabolism and basal immunity are described here. In silico screening of the transcriptome data set for antimicrobial peptide (AMP) -encoding sequences was also carried out and three lipid transfer proteins (LTP) were identified as potential AMPs involved in plant defense. Spathe predicted protein maps were drawn, and suggested that major plant efforts are expended in guaranteeing the maintenance of cell homeostasis, characterized by high investment in carbohydrate, amino acid and energy metabolism as well as in genetic information."

Currently, observations are limited to the documentation of accidental records after the passing of such events. A more comprehensive approach is synthesising weather events in a location over a long time period, ideally at a high spatial resolution and on a large geographic scale. We provide a detailed overview on how to generate hurricane exposure data at a meso-climate level for a specific region. As a case study we modelled landscape hurricane exposure in Cusuco National Park (CNP), Honduras with a resolution of 50 m×50 m patches. We calculated actual hurricane exposure vulnerability site scores (EVVS) through the combination of a wind pressure model, an exposure model that can incorporate simple wind dynamics within a 3-dimensional landscape and the integration of historical hurricanes data. The EVSS was calculated as a weighted function of sites exposure, hurricane frequency and maximum wind velocity. Eleven hurricanes were found to have affected CNP between 1995 and 2010. The highest EVSS’s were predicted to be on South and South-East facing sites of the park. Ground validation demonstrated that the South-solution (i.e. the South wind inflow direction) explained most of the observed tree damage (90% of the observed tree damage in the field). Incorporating historical data to the model to calculate actual hurricane exposure values, instead of potential exposure values, increased the model fit by 50%."
https://openalex.org/W2031273968,"Objective To assess the accuracy of PIMA Point-of-Care (POC) CD4 testing in rural Rakai, Uganda. Methods 903 HIV positive persons attending field clinics provided a venous blood sample assessed on site using PIMA analyzers per manufacturer's specifications. The venous samples were then run on FACSCalibur flow cytometry at a central facility. The Bland–Altman method was used to estimate mean bias and 95% limits of agreement (LOA). Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated for a CD4 threshold of <350 and <500 cells/uL for antiretroviral eligibility. Results There was a high correlation between PIMA and FACSCalibur CD4 counts (r = 0.943, p<0.001). Relative to FACSCalibur, the PIMA POC CD4 had negative mean bias of −34.6 cells/uL (95% LOA: −219.8 to 150.6) overall. The dispersion at CD4<350 cells/uL was 5.1 cells/uL (95% LOA: −126.6 to 136.8). For a threshold of CD4<350 cells/uL, PIMA venous blood had a sensitivity of 88.6% (95%CI 84.8–92.4%), specificity of 87.5% (95%CI 84.9–90.1%), NPV of 94.9% (95%CI 93.1–96.7%), and PPV of 74.4% (95%CI 69.6–79.2%). PIMA sensitivity and PPV significantly increased to 96.1% and 88.3% respectively with increased threshold of 500 cells/uL. Conclusions Overall, PIMA POC CD4 counts demonstrated negative bias compared to FACSCalibur. PIMA POC sensitivity improved significantly at a higher CD4 threshold of 500 than a 350 cells/uL threshold."

https://openalex.org/W2119550821,"Coastal marshes depend on belowground biomass of roots and rhizomes to contribute to peat and soil organic carbon, accrete soil and alleviate flooding as sea level rises. For nutrient-limited plants, eutrophication has either reduced or stimulated belowground biomass depending on plant biomass allocation response to fertilization. Within a freshwater wetland impoundment receiving minimal sediments, we used experimental plots to explore growth models for a common freshwater macrophyte, Schoenoplectus acutus. We used N-addition and control plots (4 each) to test whether remotely sensed vegetation indices could predict leaf N concentration, root:shoot ratios and belowground biomass of S. acutus. Following 5 months of summer growth, we harvested whole plants, measured leaf N and total plant biomass of all above and belowground vegetation. Prior to harvest, we simulated measurement of plant spectral reflectance over 164 hyperspectral Hyperion satellite bands (350–2500 nm) with a portable spectroradiometer. N-addition did not alter whole plant, but reduced belowground biomass 36% and increased aboveground biomass 71%. We correlated leaf N concentration with known N-related spectral regions using all possible normalized difference (ND), simple band ratio (SR) and first order derivative ND (FDN) and SR (FDS) vegetation indices. FDN1235, 549 was most strongly correlated with leaf N concentration and also was related to belowground biomass, the first demonstration of spectral indices and belowground biomass relationships. While S. acutus exhibited balanced growth (reduced root:shoot ratio with respect to nutrient addition), our methods also might relate N-enrichment to biomass point estimates for plants with isometric root growth. For isometric growth, foliar N indices will scale equivalently with above and belowground biomass. Leaf N vegetation indices should aid in scaling-up field estimates of biomass and assist regional monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2168924799,"Feral pigs occur throughout tropical far north Queensland, Australia and are a significant threat to biodiversity and World Heritage values, agriculture and are a vector of infectious diseases. One of the constraints on long-lasting, local eradication of feral pigs is the process of reinvasion into recently controlled areas. This study examined the population genetic structure of feral pigs in far north Queensland to identify the extent of movement and the scale at which demographically independent management units exist. Genetic analysis of 328 feral pigs from the Innisfail to Tully region of tropical Queensland was undertaken. Seven microsatellite loci were screened and Bayesian clustering methods used to infer population clusters. Sequence variation at the mitochondrial DNA control region was examined to identify pig breed. Significant population structure was identified in the study area at a scale of 25 to 35 km, corresponding to three demographically independent management units (MUs). Distinct natural or anthropogenic barriers were not found, but environmental features such as topography and land use appear to influence patterns of gene flow. Despite the strong, overall pattern of structure, some feral pigs clearly exhibited ancestry from a MU outside of that from which they were sampled indicating isolated long distance dispersal or translocation events. Furthermore, our results suggest that gene flow is restricted among pigs of domestic Asian and European origin and non-random mating influences management unit boundaries. We conclude that the three MUs identified in this study should be considered as operational units for feral pig control in far north Queensland. Within a MU, coordinated and simultaneous control is required across farms, rainforest areas and National Park Estates to prevent recolonisation from adjacent localities."
https://openalex.org/W2041002701,"To prospectively examine the relation between tumor vascularity and glucose metabolism in adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma(SCC) of the lung by using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI).Forty-one consecutive patients with histologically confirmed untreated NSCLC underwent routine diagnostic work-up, including DCE-MRI and PET/CT. PET/CT images were used to derive glucose metabolism (SUVmax and SUVmean), and DCE-MRI images were used to derive tumor vascularity (Ktrans, Kep, Ve and iAUC). Any differences in the DCE-MRI and PET/CT estimations between the NSCLC subtypes were determined by the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were calculated between the DCE-MRI parameter values and the SUV.SUVmean and SUVmax in AC were significantly lower than in SCC, but Ktrans and Ve in AC were significantly higher than in SCC. Significant correlations between SUV and DCE-MRI parameters were observed for SUVmax and Ve (ρ = -0.357, P = 0.022), SUVmean and Ktrans (ρ = -0.341, P = 0.029), and SUVmean and iAUC (ρ = -0.374, P = 0.016 ) in total; for SUVmax and iAUC (ρ = -0.420, P = 0.037), SUVmean and Ktrans (ρ = -0.411, P = 0.041), SUVmean and Kep (ρ = -0.045, P = 0.026), and SUVmean and iAUC (ρ = -0.512, P = 0.009) in AC; However, for neither in SCC.AC and SCC showed different patterns in both tumor vascularity and glucose metabolism. Tumor vascularity and glucose metabolism negatively correlated in AC, but not in SCC. These differences may underlie the heterogeneity in clinical aspect of NSCLC subtypes and have implications for their imaging profiling and monitor the treatment response."
https://openalex.org/W2088800448,"P2Y receptor activation may link the effect of purines to increased maximal in vitro activity of the Na,K-ATPase in rat muscle. The hypothesis that a similar mechanism is present in human skeletal muscle was investigated with membranes from rat and human skeletal muscle.Membranes purified from rat and human muscles were used in the Na,K-ATPase assay. Incubation with ADP, the stable ADP analogue MeS-ADP and UDP increased the Na+ dependent Na,K-ATPase activity in rat muscle membranes, whereas similar treatments of human muscle membranes lowered the Na,K-ATPase activity. UTP incubation resulted in unchanged Na,K-ATPase activity in humans, but pre-incubation with the antagonist suramin resulted in inhibition with UTP, suggesting that P2Y receptors are involved. The Na,K-ATPase in membranes from both rat and human could be stimulated by protein kinase A and C activation. Thus, protein kinase A and C activation can increase Na,K-ATPase activity in human muscle but not via P2Y receptor stimulation.The inhibitory effects of most purines (with the exception of UTP) in human muscle membranes are probably due to mass law inhibition of ATP hydrolysis. This inhibition could be blurred in rat due to receptor mediated activation of the Na,K-ATPase. The different effects could be related to a high density of ADP sensitive P2Y1 and P2Y13 receptors in rat, whereas the UTP sensitive P2Y11 could be more abundant in human. Alternatively, rat could possesses a mechanism for protein-protein interaction between P2Y receptors and the Na,K-ATPase, and this mechanism could be absent in human skeletal muscle (perhaps with the exception of the UTP sensitive P2Y11 receptor).Rat muscle is not a reliable model for purinergic effects on Na,K-ATPase in human skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2040142922,"Protein-protein interactions play an essential role in almost any biological processes. Therefore, there is a particular need for methods which describe the interactions of a defined target protein in its physiological context. Here we report a method to photo-cross-link interacting proteins in S. cerevisiae by using the non-canonical amino acid p-azido-L-phenylalanine (pAzpa). Based on the expanded genetic code the photoreactive non-canonical amino acid pAzpa was site-specifically incorporated at eight positions into a domain of Aha1 that was previously described to bind Hsp90 in vitro to function as a cochaperone of Hsp90 and activates its ATPase activity. In vivo photo-cross-linking to the cognate binding partner of Aha1 was carried out by irradiation of mutant strains with UV light (365 nm) to induce covalent intermolecular bonds. Surprisingly, an interaction between Aha1 and Hsp90 was not detected, although, we could confirm binding of suppressed pAzpa containing Aha1 to Hsp90 by native co-immunoprecipitation. However, a homodimer consisting of two covalently crosslinked Aha1 monomers was identified by mass spectrometry. This homodimer could also be confirmed using p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine, another photoreactive non-canonical amino acid. Crosslinking was highly specific as it was dependent on irradiation using UV light, the exact position of the non-canonical amino acid in the protein sequence as well as on the addition of the non-canonical amino acid to the growth medium. Therefore it seems possible that an interaction of Aha1 with Hsp90 takes place at different positions than previously described in vitro highlighting the importance of in vivo techniques to study protein-protein interactions. Accordingly, the expanded genetic code can easily be applied to other S. cerevisiae proteins to study their interaction under physiological relevant conditions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2077804973,"While many signals cause upregulation of the pro-inflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase -2 (COX-2), much less is known about mechanisms that actively downregulate its expression. We have recently shown that the prostaglandin EP1 receptor reduces the expression of COX-2 in a pathway that facilitates its ubiquitination and degradation via the 26S proteasome. Here we show that an elevation of COX-2 intracellular levels causes an increase in the endogenous expression of prostaglandin EP1. The increase in EP1 levels does not occur at the transcriptional level, but is rather associated with complex formation between the receptor and COX-2, which occurs both in vitro and in mammalian tissues. The EP1-COX-2 complex is disrupted following binding of arachidonic acid to COX-2 and accompanied by a parallel reduction in EP1 levels. We propose that a transient interaction between COX-2 and EP1 constitutes a feedback loop whereby an increase in COX-2 expression elevates EP1, which ultimately acts to downregulate COX-2 by expediting its proteasomal degradation. Such a post translational mechanism may serve to control both the ligand-generating system of COX-2 and its reception system."
https://openalex.org/W2019595073,"To better understand the molecular mechanism underlying of diapause in Antheraea pernyi (A.pernyi), we cloned a novel diapause-associated protein 3 (DAP3) gene from A.pernyi by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and studied the biological functions. Sequence analysis revealed that this gene encodes 171 amino acids and has a conserved domain of Copper/Zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD). Western blot and qRT-PCR results showed that DAP3 was mainly expressed in the pupal stage, and gradually decreased as diapause development. DAP3 was also expressed in 1st and 5th instar larvae of A.pernyi. In tissues of 5th instar larvae of A.pernyi, DAP3 was mainly expressed in the epidermis, followed by the head, hemolymph and fat body. To identify the SOD activity of DAP3, we constructed a prokaryotic expression vector by inserting the coding region sequence into plasmid pET-28a (+) and obtained the purified rHIS-DAP3 fusion protein by Ni-NTA affinitive column. Importantly, we found the SOD activity of DAP3 fusion protein was approximately 0.6674 U/µg. To further confirm the SOD activity of DAP3 in vivo, we induced the oxidative stress model of pupae by UV irradiation. The results showed that both the mRNA and protein level of DAP3 significantly increased by UV irradiation. Furthermore, the SOD activity of the total lysate of pupae increased significantly at 10 min post UV irradiation and transiently returned to normal level afterwards. These results suggested that DAP3 might be a novel protein with SOD activity getting involved in regulation of diapause in A.pernyi."
https://openalex.org/W1985518055,"Lipotoxic cardiomyopathy is caused by myocardial lipid accumulation and often occurs in patients with diabetes and obesity. This study investigated the effects of β-lapachone (β-lap), a natural compound that activates Sirt1 through elevation of the intracellular NAD+ level, on acyl CoA synthase (ACS) transgenic (Tg) mice, which have lipotoxic cardiomyopathy. Oral administration of β-lap to ACS Tg mice significantly attenuated heart failure and inhibited myocardial accumulation of triacylglycerol. Electron microscopy and measurement of mitochondrial complex II protein and mitochondrial DNA revealed that administration of β-lap restored mitochondrial integrity and biogenesis in ACS Tg hearts. Accordingly, β-lap administration significantly increased the expression of genes associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid metabolism that were down-regulated in ACS Tg hearts. β-lap also restored the activities of Sirt1 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the two key regulators of metabolism, which were suppressed in ACS Tg hearts. In H9C2 cells, β-lap-mediated elevation of AMPK activity was retarded when the level of Sirt1 was reduced by transfection of siRNA against Sirt1. Taken together, these results indicate that β-lap exerts cardioprotective effects against cardiac lipotoxicity through the activation of Sirt1 and AMPK. β-lap may be a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of lipotoxic cardiomyopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2015059743,"Elevated levels of systemic IL-10 have been associated with several chronic viral infections, including HCV, EBV, HCMV and LCMV. In the chronic LCMV infection model, both elevated IL-10 and enhanced infection of dendritic cells (DCs) are important for viral persistence. This report highlights the relationship between enhanced viral tropism for DCs and the induction of IL-10 in CD4 T cells, which we identify as the most frequent IL-10-expressing cell type in chronic LCMV infection. Here we report that infected CD8αneg DCs express elevated IL-10, induce IL-10 expression in LCMV specific CD4 T cells, and suppress LCMV-specific T cell proliferation. DCs exposed in vivo to persistent LCMV retain the capacity to stimulate CD4 T cell proliferation but induce IL-10 production by both polyclonal and LCMV-specific CD4 T cells. Our study delineates the unique effects of direct infection versus viral exposure on DCs. Collectively these data point to enhanced infection of DCs as a key trigger of the IL-10 induction cascade resulting in maintenance of elevated IL-10 expression in CD4 T cells and inhibition of LCMV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1966349553,"To study anatomical structures related to Meckel cave with endonasal endoscopic approach and to provide an anatomical basis for endoscopic surgery in Meckel cave.Meckel cave of 5 adult skulls (10 sides) were fixed with 10% formalin. The anatomical structures of Meckel cave and the related zones adjacent to Meckel cave were observed and measured with endoscopic endonasal approach.Endoscopic endonasal, endo-maxillary sinus, and endo-pterygoid process approaches were successfully applied in observation of the anatomical structures of meckel cave and the rerated zones adjacent to Meckel cave and in measurement of distances between related anatomical structures for each case of samples. The relevant data were obtained. The distance between the front mouth of palatovaginal canal and vidian canal was 21.4±7 mm, the distance between opening of sphenoid sinus to the upper margin of the choana was 22.3±2.8 mm, the distance between the opening of vidian and foramen rotundum was 7.57±0.7 mm and the length of the pterygoid canal was 13.3±1.2 mm. Based on these data, the positions of the related important structures can be roughly located during surgical operation and various important structures in Meckel cave and its adjacent zones can be found out in a convenient and safe way.1) It is feasible to use endonasal endoscopic approach to perform surgical operation in Meckel cave; 2) Use of endonasal endoscopic approach can protect and fully take the advantage of the vidian nerve to locate the position of foramina lacerum of the internal carotid artery during surgical operation; and 3) the observational and experimental data obtained with this approach can provide the rational basis for clinical operation procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2022100822,"The late assembly domain of many viruses is critical for budding. Within these domains, encoded in viral structural proteins, are the conserved motifs PTAP, PPxY and YPxL. These sequences are the key determinants for association of viral proteins with intracellular molecules such as Tsg101, Nedd4 and AIP1/ALIX. While roles for Tsg101 and AIP1/ALIX in HIV-1 budding have been well established, less is known about the role of Nedd4. Recent studies, however, have identified a function for Nedd4-like protein in HIV-1 release. In this study, we investigated post-transcriptional changes of Nedd4 following SHIVSF162P3 infection of rhesus macaques, its role on HIV-1 p24 and gp120 levels in vitro and its potential as an immune modulator in HIV vaccination of BALB/c mice. Increased Nedd4 protein levels were noted in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells following SHIVSF162P3-infection of naïve macaques. Transient co-transfection studies in 293 cells with HXB2 and Nedd4 demonstrated a Nedd4-mediated increase in p24 and gp120 levels. This increase was found to be dependent on the Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated phospholipid binding C2 domain and not ubiquitin ligase activity or HIV LTR activity. Co-transfection of Nedd4 with plasmid DNA expressing Gag or Env was further shown to augment both intracellular and extracellular Gag or Env proteins. To assess the potential of Nedd4 as an immune modulator, BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly with plasmid DNA encoding HIV gag, env and Nedd4. Nedd4 co-administration was found to increase serum anti-p24 but not anti-gp120 antibodies. Nedd4 co-injection was found to have no affect on Gag- or Env-specific IFNγ but had a trend of increased Gag-specific IL-6, IL-17A and TNFα that was not seen following Env stimulation. Based on our initial findings, Nedd4-mediated changes in HIV protein levels and its potential use in HIV-1 vaccine development warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2073044222,"Aim Elevated levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) have been found in endometrial cancer (EC), suggesting that it is essential to the development of EC. Obesity and diabetes have been established as known risk factors of EC, while SREBF-1 gene polymorphisms have also been found to be associated with obesity and type II diabetes. Therefore, we hypothesize that single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in SREBF-1 gene may be associated with increased risk of EC. Method We analyzed the sequence of SREBF-1 in tissue samples from 30 EC cases and 6 benign controls using high throughput method. Based on the primary results, we selected one SNP (rs2297508) as a genetic marker to conduct a hospital-based case-control study with 139 EC cases and 129 benign controls. The samples were examined under the microscope to determine their histopathology prior to the SNP analysis using RT-PCR. Results Through sequence analysis, we found 10 SNPs of SREBF-1 associated with EC, including 3 new SNPs. Fourteen percent of EC showed the rs2297508 SNP with C allele, while only 7% had the C allele was present in benign controls (p = 0.027, OR = 1.983). Additionally, the C allele was associated with cancer differentiation (p<0.05) and the depth of myometrial invasion (p<0.05). Conclusion Our study indicates that SNP (rs2297508) of SREBF-1 may serve as a genetic predisposition factor for the development of EC and screening of such genetic marker may be helpful in its early detection."
https://openalex.org/W1984034803,"Purpose In breast cancer therapy, the indication for systemic therapy is typically based on prognostic markers from the surgical excision specimen. If such is unavailable, for instance prior to tumor ablation therapy, the indication for adjuvant systemic therapy may be assessed from pretreatment biopsies. The effect of differences in tumor characteristics between biopsy and excision specimen on agreement in indication for systemic therapy is, however, largely unknown. The aim of this study is to determine the agreement in eligibility for systemic therapy between preoperative and postoperative assessment. Secondly, to identify which patient-, tumor- or lymph node characteristics may influence this agreement. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 300 consecutive female patients with primary invasive breast carcinoma on biopsy were included. Indication for systemic therapy was determined separately from biopsied tissue and from excision specimens using national guidelines based on adjuvant! online. Agreement was assessed, and patient-, tumor- and lymph node characteristics affecting agreement analyzed. Results Agreement in tumor characteristics between biopsy and excision specimen varied from high (ER-status: 99%), to lower (tumor grade: 62%, tumor size: 59%, and lymph node status: 67%). Without preoperative sentinel node biopsy (SNB), agreement on systemic therapy exists in 77% of patients (kappa = 0,547). Positive pretreatment indication for systemic therapy was highly indicative of the postoperative indication (PPV = 94%). Negative indication was, however, only indicative in 67% of patients. Conversely, with preoperative SNB, agreement on negative indication was raised to 89%. Agreement was especially high for ER-negative status, tumor grade 3, tumor size >2 cm, lymph node positivity at biopsy and a negative preoperative SNB. Conclusions A positive indication for systemic therapy from biopsy is highly indicative for a positive indication from the excision specimen. When the indication is negative, additional stratification using preoperative SNB raises the agreement. Still, discordance occurs in 1 out of 10 patients."
https://openalex.org/W2080279699,"An emerging issue in wildlife conservation is the re-establishment of viable populations of endangered species in suitable habitats. Here, we studied habitat selection by a population of Hainan Eld's deer (Cervus eldi) relocated to a patchy landscape of farmland and forest. Hainan Eld's deer were pushed to the brink of extinction in the 1970s, but their population expanded rapidly from 26 to more than 1000 individuals by 2003 through effective reserve protection. As part of a wider relocation and population management strategy, 131 deer were removed from the reserve and reintroduced into a farmland-forest landscape in 2005. Habitat use under a context of human disturbance was surveyed by monitoring 19 radio-collared animals. The majority of deer locations (77%) were within 0.6-2 km of villages. Annual home ranges of these collared deer averaged 725 ha (SD 436), which was 55% of the size of the reserve from which they had originated. The annual home ranges contained 54% shrub-grassland, 26% forest and 15% farmland. The relocated deer population selected landscape comprising slash-and-burn agriculture and forest, and avoided both intensively farmed areas and areas containing only forest. Within the selected landscape, deer preferred swiddens and shrub-grasslands. Forests above 300 m in elevation were avoided, whereas forests below 300 m in elevation were overrepresented during the dry season and randomly used during the wet season. Our findings show that reintroduced deer can utilize disturbed habitats, and further demonstrate that subsistence agroforest ecosystems have the capacity to sustain endangered ungulates."
https://openalex.org/W2019990834,"Optogenetic stimulation of specific types of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum has been shown to bias the selection of mice in a two choices task. This shift is dependent on the localisation and on the intensity of the stimulation but also on the recent reward history. We have implemented a way to simulate this increased activity produced by the optical flash in our computational model of the basal ganglia (BG). This abstract model features the direct and indirect pathways commonly described in biology, and a reward prediction pathway (RP). The framework is similar to Actor-Critic methods and to the ventral/dorsal distinction in the striatum. We thus investigated the impact on the selection caused by an added stimulation in each of the three pathways. We were able to reproduce in our model the bias in action selection observed in mice. Our results also showed that biasing the reward prediction is sufficient to create a modification in the action selection. However, we had to increase the percentage of trials with stimulation relative to that in experiments in order to impact the selection. We found that increasing only the reward prediction had a different effect if the stimulation in RP was action dependent (only for a specific action) or not. We further looked at the evolution of the change in the weights depending on the stage of learning within a block. A bias in RP impacts the plasticity differently depending on that stage but also on the outcome. It remains to experimentally test how the dopaminergic neurons are affected by specific stimulations of neurons in the striatum and to relate data to predictions of our model."
