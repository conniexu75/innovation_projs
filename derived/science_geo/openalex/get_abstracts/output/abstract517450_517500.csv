Defects in autophagy are implicated in many pathological processes, including inflammatory bowel disease. Among the innate defense mechanisms of intestinal mucosa, a defective tight junction (TJ) barrier has been postulated as a key pathogenic factor in the causation and progression of inflammatory bowel disease by allowing increased antigenic permeation. The cross-talk between autophagy and the TJ barrier has not yet been described. In this study, we present the novel finding that autophagy enhances TJ barrier function in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. Nutrient starvation-induced autophagy significantly increased transepithelial electrical resistance and reduced the ratio of sodium/chloride paracellular permeability. Nutrient starvation reduced the paracellular permeability of small-sized urea but not larger molecules. The role of autophagy in the modulation of paracellular permeability was confirmed by pharmacological induction as well as pharmacological and genetic inhibition of autophagy. Consistent with the autophagy-induced reduction in paracellular permeability, a marked decrease in the level of the cation-selective, pore-forming TJ protein claudin-2 was observed after cell starvation. Starvation reduced the membrane presence of claudin-2 and increased its cytoplasmic, lysosomal localization. Therefore, our data show that autophagy selectively reduces epithelial TJ permeability of ions and small molecules by lysosomal degradation of the TJ protein claudin-2.

https://openalex.org/W1999353776,"Interferon regulatory factor 8 (Irf8) is critical for mammalian macrophage development and innate immunity, but its role in teleost myelopoiesis remains incompletely understood. In particular, genetic tools to analyze the role of Irf8 in zebrafish macrophage development at larval and adult stages are lacking. We generated irf8 null mutants in zebrafish using TALEN-mediated targeting. Our analysis defines different requirements for irf8 at different stages. irf8 is required for formation of all macrophages during primitive and transient definitive hematopoiesis, but not during adult-phase definitive hematopoiesis starting at 5-6 days postfertilization. At early stages, irf8 mutants have excess neutrophils and excess cell death in pu.1-expressing myeloid cells. Macrophage fates were recovered in irf8 mutants after wildtype irf8 expression in neutrophil and macrophage lineages, suggesting that irf8 regulates macrophage specification and survival. In juvenile irf8 mutant fish, mature macrophages are present, but at numbers significantly reduced compared to wildtype, indicating an ongoing requirement for irf8 after embryogenesis. As development progresses, tissue macrophages become apparent in zebrafish irf8 mutants, with the possible exception of microglia. Our study defines distinct requirement for irf8 in myelopoiesis before and after transition to the adult hematopoietic system."

Here, we show that expression of microRNA (miR)-520g is correlated with drug resistance of colon cancer cells. Ectopic expression of miR-520g conferred resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)- or oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis in vitro and reduced the effectiveness of 5-FU in the inhibition of tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model in vivo. Further studies indicated that miR-520g mediated drug resistance through down-regulation of p21 expression. Moreover, p53 suppressed miR-520g expression, and deletion of p53 up-regulated miR-520g expression. Inhibition of miR-520g in p53−/− cells increased their sensitivity to 5-FU treatment. Importantly, studies of patient samples indicated that expression of miR-520g correlated with chemoresistance in colorectal cancer. These findings indicate that the p53/miR-520g/p21 signaling axis plays an important role in the response of colorectal cancer to chemotherapy. A major implication of our studies is that inhibition of miR-520g or restoration of p21 expression may have considerable therapeutic potential to overcome drug resistance in colorectal cancer patients, especially in those with mutant p53.

Colorectal cancer is currently the third most common cancer diagnosed in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) 2The abbreviations used are: 5-FU5-fluorouracilmiRNA/miRmicroRNAPARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymeraseMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideqPCRquantitative PCRXIAPX-linked inhibitor of apoptosis. is one of the most commonly used drugs in colorectal cancer therapy. It acts principally as a thymidylate synthase inhibitor (1.Longley D.B. Harkin D.P. Johnston P.G. 5-Fluorouracil: mechanisms of action and clinical strategies.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 330-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (3512) Google Scholar). Interrupting the action of this enzyme blocks synthesis of the pyrimidine thymidine, which is a nucleoside required for DNA replication. As a result, 5-FU is able to induce cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in cancer cells. Although adjuvant 5-FU treatment has a good success rate, recurrence of colorectal cancer is still frequent due to the development of drug resistance. Many mechanisms have been proposed to be responsible for drug resistance, including limitation of accumulation of drugs within cells by reducing uptake, enhancing efflux, or affecting membrane lipids; activation of detoxification; inhibition of apoptosis; and alterations in cell cycle and checkpoints (1.Longley D.B.

However, no significant advance has been made to identify targets against drug resistance (5.Gottesman M.M. Mechanisms of cancer drug resistance.Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (2116) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to better understand the mechanisms of drug resistance and uncover new targets to improve efficacy of chemotherapeutic treatment. 5-fluorouracil microRNA poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide quantitative PCR X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small non-protein-coding RNAs. They are evolutionarily conserved in the genomes of animals, plants, fungi, and viruses (6.Du T. Zamore P.D. microPrimer: the biogenesis and function of microRNA.Development. 2005; 132: 4645-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). miRNAs promote mRNA degradation or inhibit translation of many different target genes through sequence-specific interaction with their 3′-UTRs (7.Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15858) Google Scholar). It is estimated that miRNAs regulate more than one-third of human genes and the majority of genetic pathways (8.Hwang H.W. Mendell J.T. MicroRNAs in cell proliferation, cell death, and tumorigenesis.Br. J. Cancer. 2006; 94: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 9.Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Conserved seed pairing, often flanked by adenosines, indicates that thousands of human genes are microRNA targets.Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9835) Google Scholar). Alterations in miRNA expression are associated with many human cancers (10.Zhang B. Pan X. Cobb G.P. Anderson T.A. MicroRNAs as oncogenes and tumor suppressors.Dev. Biol. 2007; 302: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). Therefore, miRNA profiling or signature in cancers has been proposed to be used to classify tumor subtypes, diagnose cancer, determine treatment plan, and predict patient outcome (11.Calin G.A. Dumitru C.D. Shimizu M. Bichi R. Zupo S. Noch E. Aldler H. Rattan S. Keating M. Rai K.

Cancer. 2006; 6: 857-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (6605) Google Scholar). In addition, miRNAs function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors depending on their target genes (10.Zhang B. Pan X. Cobb G.P. Anderson T.A. MicroRNAs as oncogenes and tumor suppressors.Dev. Biol. 2007; 302: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar, 14.Calin G.A. Croce C.M. MicroRNAs and chromosomal abnormalities in cancer cells.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6202-6210Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Much effort has been taken to understand the roles of miRNAs in cancer and the potential of manipulating miRNAs for cancer therapy. The pleiotropic nature of gene regulation by miRNAs suggests that some miRNAs may function as crucial mediators of drug resistance. The p53 tumor suppressor is a transcriptional factor that can be activated by various stresses, including exposure to chemotherapeutic agents (15.Sun X.-X. Dai M.-S. Lu H. 5-Fluorouracil activation of p53 involves an MDM2-ribosomal protein interaction.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8052-8059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Activation of p53 results in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, mediated through enhanced expression of cell cycle-regulating proteins such as p21, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, or of a number of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax (16.Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Tumor suppressor p53 is a direct transcriptional activator of the human bax gene.Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Although the role of p53 in the response of tumors to therapy is controversial (16.Miyashita T. Reed J.C.

In this study, we discovered a novel p53/miR-520g/p21 signaling axis that mediates the response of colon cancer cells to 5-FU treatment. We show that p53 suppresses miR-520g expression and that deletion of p53 up-regulates miR-520g expression. Inhibition of miR-520g in p53−/− cells increased their sensitivity to 5-FU treatment. miR-520g conferred resistance to 5-FU-induced apoptosis through the inhibition of p21 expression, which is a direct target of miR-520g. Rescued expression of p21 in miR-520g-expressing colon cancer cells sensitized them to 5-FU-induced apoptosis. Importantly, experiments in tumor xenograft mouse models demonstrate that miR-520g reduced the effectiveness of 5-FU in the inhibition of tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, studies of colorectal cancer specimens indicate a positive correlation between miR-520g expression and chemoresistance. Our studies have identified miR-520g as a potential target for drug resistance in colorectal cancer. The human colon carcinoma RKO, HCT116, FET, and GEO cell lines were cultured in McCoy's 5A serum-free medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 20 μg/ml insulin, and 4 μg/ml transferrin (21.Boyd D.D. Levine A.E. Brattain D.E. McKnight M.K. Brattain M.G. Comparison of growth requirements of two human intratumoral colon carcinoma cell lines in monolayer and soft agarose.Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 2469-2474PubMed Google Scholar). The HCT116 p53−/− cell line was cultured in McCoy's 5A serum-free medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. 5-FU and oxaliplatin were purchased from Sigma. Anti-hsa-miR-520g-3p miScript miRNA inhibitor was purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Antibodies for Western blot analyses were purchased as indicated: anti-cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); anti-p21 and anti-p53, Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); and anti-actin, Sigma. Colon cancer cells were plated in 96-well plates and treated with 5-FU or oxaliplatin for the indicated times. Cells were stained for 2 h with thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma). The absorbance at 570 nm was read on an ELx808 absorbance microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT) after the purple precipitates were dissolved with MTT detergent reagent. Cell viability was calculated as the ratio of the absorbance values of drug-treated samples to those of controls. Apoptosis was detected using a DNA fragmentation ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science). Whole cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Equivalent amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of miR-520g-3p was determined by miScript primer assays with an miScript SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). RNU6-2 was used as an endogenous reference gene. The reverse complementary sequence of miR-520g-3p was synthesized and cloned into a Promega psiCHECK2 vector downstream of the Renilla reporter gene to generate psiCHECK2-520g. The 3′-UTR of p21 containing miR-520g-binding sites was amplified and cloned into the same vector to generate psiCHECK2-p21. The psiCHECK2 vector contains a second reporter gene (firefly luciferase) and is designed for end point lytic assays. The reporter was transfected into cells using Lipofectamine LTX (Life Technologies). Luciferase activity was measured 48 h later using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay (Promega). Values were normalized with firefly luciferase activity. cDNA encoding human miR-520g precursor (∼300 bp) was cloned into the pCDH-CMV lentiviral vector (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). shRNAs targeting p21 were constructed by cloning annealed oligonucleotides into the FSIPPW lentiviral vector. The targeting sequences of p21 shRNA are GTGGACAGCGAGCAGCTGA and CTTCGACTTTGTCACCGAG. 293 packaging cells were cotransfected with pPACKH1 packaging plasmid mixture (System Biosciences) and the lentiviral vectors using FuGENE HD (Promega). Viruses were harvested 48 h later and used to infect target cells. Experiments involving animals were approved by the University of Nebraska Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. HCT116 cells (2 × 106) expressing miR-520g or an empty vector were injected into the flanks of male athymic nude mice (4–5 weeks old). One week after injection, 5-FU (40 mg/kg/day) or carrier was administered by intraperitoneal injection for 5 consecutive days/week for 2 weeks (22.Valeri N. Gasparini P. Braconi C. Paone A. Lovat F. Fabbri M. Sumani K.M. Alder H. Amadori D. Patel T. MicroRNA-21 induces resistance to 5-fluorouracil by down-regulating human DNA MutS homolog 2 (hMSH2).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 21098-21103Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Tumor volumes were measured at the beginning of the treatment and every other day after that until the mice were terminated. The estimated tumor volumes (V) were calculated by the formula V = W2 × L × 0.5, where W represents the largest tumor diameter in centimeters, and L represents the next largest tumor diameter. The relative tumor volumes (RTV) were calculated by RTV = Vx/V0, where Vx is the volume in cubic millimeters at a given time, and V0 is the volume at the beginning of the treatment (22.Valeri N. Gasparini P. Braconi C. Paone A. Lovat F. Fabbri M. Sumani K.M. Alder H. Amadori D. Patel T. MicroRNA-21 induces resistance to 5-fluorouracil by down-regulating human DNA MutS homolog 2 (hMSH2).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 21098-21103Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Tumors were dissected out and weighed. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of tumors were stained for TUNEL and Ki67 using the procedure described previously (23.Geng L. Chaudhuri A. Talmon G. Wisecarver J.L. Are C. Brattain M. Wang J. MicroRNA-192 suppresses liver metastasis of colon cancer.Oncogene. 2014; 33: 5332-5340Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Three tumors from each group were analyzed. Ten histologically similar fields were randomly selected from each slide for analysis. Apoptosis and proliferation of tumor cells were determined quantitatively by counting the numbers and calculating the percentage of positively stained cells for TUNEL and Ki67 at ×20 magnification, respectively. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks of human colorectal adenocarcinomas were obtained from files of the Department of Pathology and Microbiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The ages of all patients (including both men and women) were between 55 and 85 years. The cancer patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy prior to surgical removal of the tumors. The study was performed with the approval of the ethics committee of the Institutional Review Board. The formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded slides were deparaffinized using Histo-Clear and rehydrated following hematoxylin staining to identify the tumor areas under a microscope. The tumor areas were then scrapped with a fine scalpel and collected in an Eppendorf tube. RNA was extracted using an miRNeasy FFPE kit (Qiagen). Expression of miR-520g-3p was determined by qPCR as described above. Statistical analyses were performed using two-way analysis of variance or Student's t test. 5-FU is one of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agents for colorectal cancer. However, the lack of response due to drug resistance has been a main problem that affects the outcome of cancer therapy. To better understand the mechanisms of drug resistance, we examined a panel of colon cancer cell lines for their response to 5-FU treatment. Among the cell lines tested, RKO and HCT116 cells were more sensitive to 5-FU treatment compared with FET and GEO cells (Fig. 1A). Their differential response to 5-FU was attributed mainly to different sensitivities to 5-FU-induced apoptosis as reflected by DNA fragmentation assays (Fig. 1B) and PARP cleavage (Fig. 1C). To characterize the molecular determinants of these differences, we investigated the contribution of miRNAs. We identified potential miRNAs whose expression conferred 5-FU resistance in a functional screening of an miRNA library. 3Y. Zhang and J. Wang, unpublished data. Among those miRNAs identified, expression of miR-520g was positively correlated with 5-FU resistance in colon cancer cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1D, RKO and HCT116 cells expressed much lower levels of miR-520g compared with FET and GEO cells, suggesting that miR-520g may play a role in 5-FU resistance in colon cancer cells. To determine whether miR-520g confers resistance to 5-FU, it was ectopically expressed in RKO and HCT116 cells. We used luciferase reporter assays to determine the function of ectopically expressed miR-520g. The reporter plasmid psiCHECK2-520g contains the miR-520g recognition element in the 3′-UTR of the Renilla luciferase gene. In the absence of miR-520g, luciferase will be expressed, whereas in the presence of miR-520g, luciferase mRNA will be degraded (Fig. 2A, left panel). Luciferase assays revealed that the luciferase activity of psiCHECK2-520g was decreased significantly in miR-520g-expressing cells compared with vector control cells, whereas there was little change in the luciferase activity of the control plasmid psiCHECK2 (Fig. 2A, middle and right panels). This indicated that ectopically expressed miR-520g was functional in RKO and HCT116 cells. After exposure to 5-FU at different concentrations, miR-520g-expressing cells displayed increased cell viability (Fig. 2B) and significantly reduced apoptosis (Fig. 2C) compared with vector control cells. Consistent with DNA fragmentation assays in Fig. 2C, induction of PARP cleavage by 5-FU was smaller in miR-520g-expressing cells than in vector control cells (Fig. 2D). These results indicated that miR-520g protected RKO and HCT116 cells from 5-FU-induced apoptosis. To determine whether miR-520g plays a protective role in the resistance to other chemotherapeutic drugs, HCT116 cells were treated with oxaliplatin, an alkylating agent commonly used in combination with 5-FU for treating advanced colon cancer (24.Jun L. Haiping Z. Beibei Y. Genetic polymorphisms of GSTP1 related to response to 5-FU-oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and clinical outcome in advanced colorectal cancer patients.Swiss Med. Wkly. 2009; 139: 724-728PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Kim S.-H. Kwon H.-C. Oh S.Y. Lee D.M. Lee S. Lee J.-H. Roh M.-S. Kim D.-C. Park K.-J. Choi H.-J. Kim H.-J. Prognostic value of ERCC1, thymidylate synthase, and glutathione S-transferase π for 5-FU/oxaliplatin chemotherapy in advanced colorectal cancer.Am. J. Clin. Oncol. 2009; 32: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). miR-520g-expressing cells were also more resistant to oxaliplatin treatment than vector control cells as reflected by increased cell viability (Fig. 2E) and reduced apoptosis (Fig. 2F). Although 5-FU and oxaliplatin function through different targets, they may share a similar mechanism for drug resistance. Therefore, these data suggest that increased miR-520g expression may be a common mechanism for drug resistance of different chemotherapeutic agents in colon cancer cells. To test whether miR-520g-mediated resistance to 5-FU-induced apoptosis in vitro translates to drug resistance in vivo, we established a colon tumor xenograft model by subcutaneously inoculating athymic nude mice with 2 million HCT116 cells expressing vector or miR-520g. After 7 days, mice were randomly divided into two groups. One group was treated with 5-FU (40 mg/kg/day) administered by intraperitoneal injection, and the other was treated with the carrier. The treatment was for 5 consecutive days/week for 2 weeks (22.Valeri N. Gasparini P. Braconi C. Paone A. Lovat F. Fabbri M. Sumani K.M. Alder H. Amadori D. Patel T. MicroRNA-21 induces resistance to 5-fluorouracil by down-regulating human DNA MutS homolog 2 (hMSH2).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 21098-21103Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Tumor growth and therapeutic sensitivity were monitored during the course of 5-FU treatment. Xenograft tumor growth curves showed that tumors grew at similar rates independent of miR-520g expression. However, there was a marked difference in the response of tumors to 5-FU treatment. Tumors with vector-expressing cells (designated as vector tumors) did not grow during drug treatment, whereas tumors with miR-520g-expressing cells (designated as miR-520g tumors) continued to grow at a steady rate (Fig. 3A). In addition, miR-520g tumors showed significantly smaller reduction of tumor size (Fig. 3B) and tumor weight (Fig. 3C) after 5-FU treatment compared with vector tumors. These results indicated that 5-FU treatment was less effective in inhibiting the growth of miR-520g tumors than that of vector tumors. To determine whether miR-520g-mediated resistance to apoptosis in vitro is associated with reduced 5-FU effect in vivo, TUNEL assays were performed to determine the apoptotic index of tumors. TUNEL staining showed that, although the percentage of apoptotic cells was similar in miR-520g and vector tumors, the increase in apoptotic cells induced by 5-FU treatment was significantly lower in miR-520g tumors than in vector tumors (2.5-fold versus 6.2-fold) (Fig. 3D). In addition, Ki67 staining showed that 5-FU treatment decreased the percentage of proliferative cells in miR-520g tumors by 31% and in vector tumors by 77% (Fig. 3E). These studies indicated that the effect of miR-520g on drug resistance was a combined result of its resistance to 5-FU-induced apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation. Taken together, these in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate an important role of miR-520g in drug resistance of colon cancer cells. The ability of miR-520g to confer resistance to 5-FU-induced apoptosis is attributed to its ability to regulate expression of its target genes. To identify target genes of miR-520g, we used several algorithms that predict the mRNA targets of miRNAs: TargetScan (26.Grimson A. Farh K.K.-H. Johnston W.K. Garrett-Engele P. Lim L.P. Bartel D.P.

Based on the representation of miR-520g recognition sites in their 3′-UTRs, candidate target genes were predicted. Among those tested, p21 showed reduced expression in HCT116 and RKO cells expressing miR-520g compared with vector cells (Fig. 4A). To determine whether p21 is a direct target of miR-520g, the 3′-UTR of p21 containing the potential miR-520g recognition element was cloned into the luciferase reporter construct psiCHECK2-p21 (Fig. 2A, left panel). Luciferase assays showed that the luciferase activity of psiCHECK2-p21 was decreased in miR-520g-expressing cells compared with vector control cells, whereas that of the control plasmid psiCHECK2 remained unchanged (Fig. 4B). These results indicated that miR-520g repressed the 3′-UTR of p21 and that expression of p21 was directly regulated by miR-520g. p21 has been reported to have both pro- and anti-apoptotic effects (29.Galmarini C.M.

To determine whether p21 plays a role in 5-FU-induced apoptosis, its expression was knocked down by two different shRNAs. shRNA-2 showed a better knockdown effect than shRNA-1, resulting in >90% reduction of p21 expression in HCT116 and RKO cells (Fig. 4C). Knockdown of p21 expression enhanced the resistance of HCT116 and RKO cells to 5-FU-induced apoptosis as reflected by increased cell viability (Fig. 4D, upper panel) and reduced apoptosis (middle and lower panels). These results indicated that p21 was required for 5-FU-induced apoptosis. We next determined whether miR-520g-mediated resistance to 5-FU-induced apoptosis could be reversed by restoration of p21 expression. p21 cDNA was introduced into miR-520g-expressing HCT116 cells. Ectopically expressed p21 is resistant to down-regulation mediated by miR-520g due to the lack of 3′-UTRs. Restoration of p21 expression almost completely restored the sensitivity of HCT116 cells to 5-FU-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4E). These results indicated that miR-520g promoted cell survival through the down-regulation of p21 expression, which further confirmed that p21 was required for 5-FU-induced apoptosis. As a complementary approach, an anti-hsa-miR-520g miScript miRNA inhibitor was used to inhibit miR-520g expression and function. The miScript miRNA inhibitors from Qiagen are chemically synthesized, single-stranded, modified RNAs that specifically decrease endogenous miRNA levels and suppress their function when transfected into cells. We chose FET and GEO cells, which express high levels of endogenous miR-520g (Fig. 1D), for the inhibitor study. As shown in Fig. 5A, the inhibitor decreased miR-520g expression effectively in both FET and GEO cells. As a result, p21 expression was"

The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in pairs (patient and respective family member), during stay at an open visit ICU and at 30 and 90-days post-ICU discharge. We hypothesized that there was a positive correlation with the severity of symptoms among pairs and different patterns of suffering over time. Methods A prospective study was conducted in a 22-bed adult general ICU including patients with >48 hours stay. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was completed by the pairs (patients/respective family member). Interviews were made by phone at 30 and 90-days post-ICU discharge using the Impact of Event Scale (IES) and the HADS. Multivariate models were constructed to predict IES score at 30 days for patients and family members. Results Four hundred and seventy one family members and 289 patients were interviewed in the ICU forming 184 pairs for analysis. Regarding HADS score, patients presented less symptoms than family members of patients who survived and who deceased at 30 and 90-days (p<0.001). However, family members of patients who deceased scored higher anxiety and depression symptoms (p = 0.048) at 90-days when compared with family members of patients who survived. Patients and family members at 30-days had a similar IES score, but it was higher in family members at 90-days (p = 0.019). For both family members and patients, age and symptoms of anxiety and depression during ICU were the major determinants for PTSD at 30-days. Conclusions Anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms were higher in family members than in the patients. Furthermore, these symptoms in family members persisted at 3 months, while they decreased in patients."

https://openalex.org/W2040318031,"Adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ASCs) natively reside in a relatively low-oxygen tension (i.e., hypoxic) microenvironment in human body. Low oxygen tension (i.e., in situ normoxia), has been known to enhance the growth and survival rate of ASCs, which, however, may lead to the risk of tumourigenesis. Here, we investigated the tumourigenic potential of ASCs under their physiological condition to ensure their safe use in regenerative therapy. Human ASCs isolated from subcutaneous fat were cultured in atmospheric O2 concentration (21% O2) or in situ normoxia (2% O2). We found that ASCs retained their surface markers, tri-lineage differentiation potential, and self-renewal properties under in situ normoxia without altering their morphology. In situ normoxia displayed a higher proliferation and viability of ASCs with less DNA damage as compared to atmospheric O2 concentration. Moreover, low oxygen tension significantly up-regulated VEGF and bFGF mRNA expression and protein secretion while reducing the expression level of tumour suppressor genes p16, p21, p53, and pRb. However, there were no significant differences in ASCs telomere length and their relative telomerase activity when cultured at different oxygen concentrations. Collectively, even with high proliferation and survival rate, ASCs have a low tendency of developing tumour under in situ normoxia. These results suggest 2% O2 as an ideal culture condition for expanding ASCs efficiently while maintaining their characteristics."

Mitochondria are vital for normal cardiac function, and regulation of mitochondrial structure and function may impact susceptibility to CVD. To identify potential role of mitochondria in sex-related differences in susceptibility to CVD, we analyzed the basal expression levels of mitochondria-related genes in the hearts of male and female rats. Whole genome expression profiling was performed in the hearts of young (8-week), adult (21-week), and old (78-week) male and female Fischer 344 rats and the expression of 670 unique genes related to various mitochondrial functions was analyzed. A significant (p<0.05) sexual dimorphism in expression levels of 46, 114, and 41 genes was observed in young, adult and old rats, respectively. Gene Ontology analysis revealed the influence of sex on various biological pathways related to cardiac energy metabolism at different ages. The expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism was significantly different between the sexes in young and adult rat hearts. Adult male rats also showed higher expression of genes associated with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex compared to females. In young and adult hearts, sexual dimorphism was not noted in genes encoding oxidative phosphorylation. In old rats, however, a majority of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation had higher expression in females compared to males. Such basal differences between the sexes in cardiac expression of genes associated with energy metabolism may indicate a likely involvement of mitochondria in susceptibility to CVDs. In addition, female rats showed lower expression levels of apoptotic genes in hearts compared to males at all ages, which may have implications for better preservation of cardiac mass in females than in males."

Decision-making is a complex multifaceted function and different cognitive processes are involved in decision-making for gains and losses. However, the relationship between impaired decision-making and gain versus loss processing in the context of IGD is poorly understood. The main aim of the present study was to separately evaluate decision-making for risky gains and losses among college students with IGD using the Cups task. Additionally, we further examined the effects of outcome magnitude and probability level on decision-making related to risky gains and losses respectively. Sixty college students with IGD and 42 matched healthy controls (HCs) participated. Results indicated that IGD subjects exhibited generally greater risk taking tendencies than HCs. In comparison to HCs, IGD subjects made more disadvantageous risky choices in the loss domain (but not in the gain domain). Follow-up analyses indicated that the impairment was associated to insensitivity to changes in outcome magnitude and probability level for risky losses among IGD subjects. In addition, higher Internet addiction severity scores were associated with percentage of disadvantageous risky options in the loss domain. These findings emphasize the effect of insensitivity to losses on disadvantageous decisions under risk in the context of IGD, which has implications for future intervention studies."

https://openalex.org/W2023410769,"The molecular mechanism underlying the selective vulnerability of neurons to oxidative damage caused by ischemia—reperfusion (I/R) injury remains unknown. We sought to determine the role of NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) in cerebral I/R-induced brain injury and survival of newborn cells in the ischemic injured region. Male Wistar rats were subjected to 90 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion. After reperfusion, infarction size, level of superoxide and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-2dG), and Nox1 immunoreactivity were determined. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Nox1 was used to investigate the role of Nox1 in I/R-induced oxidative damage, neuronal death, motor function recovery, and ischemic neurogenesis. After I/R, Nox1 expression and 8-oxo-2dG immunoreactivity was increased in cortical neurons of the peri-infarct regions. Both infarction size and neuronal death in I/R injury were significantly reduced by adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated transduction of Nox1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA). AAV-mediated Nox1 knockdown enhanced functional recovery after MCAO. The level of survival and differentiation of newborn cells in the peri-infarct regions were increased by Nox1 inhibition. Our data suggest that Nox-1 may be responsible for oxidative damage to DNA, subsequent cortical neuronal degeneration, functional recovery, and regulation of ischemic neurogenesis in the peri-infarct regions after stroke."

Many factors influence this decision, including prestige, acceptance probability, turnaround time, target audience, fit, and impact factor. Here, we present a framework for evaluating where to submit a manuscript based on the theory of Markov decision processes. We derive two models, one in which an author is trying to optimally maximize citations and another in which that goal is balanced by either minimizing the number of resubmissions or the total time in review. We parameterize the models with data on acceptance probability, submission-to-decision times, and impact factors for 61 ecology journals. We find that submission sequences beginning with Ecology Letters, Ecological Monographs, or PLOS ONE could be optimal depending on the importance given to time to acceptance or number of resubmissions. This analysis provides some guidance on where to submit a manuscript given the individual-specific values assigned to these disparate objectives."
https://openalex.org/W1969776715,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) play important roles in many aspects of embryonic development. During eye development, the lens and corneal epithelium are derived from the same surface ectodermal tissue. FGF receptor (FGFR)-signaling is essential for lens cell differentiation and survival, but its role in corneal development has not been fully investigated. In this study, we examined the corneal defects in Fgfr2 conditional knockout mice in which Cre expression is activated at lens induction stage by Pax6 P0 promoter. The cornea in LeCre, Fgfr2loxP/loxP mice (referred as Fgfr2CKO) was analyzed to assess changes in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. We found that Fgfr2CKO cornea was much thinner in epithelial and stromal layer when compared to WT cornea. At embryonic day 12.5–13.5 (E12.5–13.5) shortly after the lens vesicle detaches from the overlying surface ectoderm, cell proliferation (judged by labeling indices of Ki-67, BrdU and phospho-histone H3) was significantly reduced in corneal epithelium in Fgfr2CKO mice. At later stage, cell differentiation markers for corneal epithelium and underlying stromal mesenchyme, keratin-12 and keratocan respectively, were not expressed in Fgfr2CKO cornea. Furthermore, Pax6, a transcription factor essential for eye development, was not present in the Fgfr2CKO mutant corneal epithelial at E16.5 but was expressed normally at E12.5, suggesting that FGFR2-signaling is required for maintaining Pax6 expression in this tissue. Interestingly, the role of FGFR2 in corneal epithelial development is independent of ERK1/2-signaling. In contrast to the lens, FGFR2 is not required for cell survival in cornea. This study demonstrates for the first time that FGFR2 plays an essential role in controlling cell proliferation and differentiation, and maintaining Pax6 levels in corneal epithelium via ERK-independent pathways during embryonic development."

At near-saturating concentrations, GCAP1 and GCAP2 activated RetGC1 from HEK293 cells and RetGC2−/−GCAPs1,2−/− mouse retinas in a non-additive fashion. The M26R GCAP1, which binds but does not activate RetGC1, suppressed activation of recombinant and native RetGC1 by competing with both GCAP1 and GCAP2. Untagged GCAP1 displaced both GCAP1-GFP and GCAP2-GFP from the complex with RetGC1 in HEK293 cells. The intracellular segment of a natriuretic peptide receptor A guanylyl cyclase failed to bind GCAPs, but replacing its kinase homology and dimerization domains with those from RetGC1 restored GCAP1 and GCAP2 binding by the hybrid cyclase and its GCAP-dependent regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2089484065,"Congenital heart valve defects in humans occur in approximately 2% of live births and are a major source of compromised cardiac function. In this study we demonstrate that normal heart valve development and cardiac function are dependent upon Galnt1, the gene that encodes a member of the family of glycosyltransferases (GalNAc-Ts) responsible for the initiation of mucin-type O-glycosylation. In the adult mouse, compromised cardiac function that mimics human congenital heart disease, including aortic and pulmonary valve stenosis and regurgitation; altered ejection fraction; and cardiac dilation, was observed in Galnt1 null animals. The underlying phenotype is aberrant valve formation caused by increased cell proliferation within the outflow tract cushion of developing hearts, which is first detected at developmental stage E11.5. Developing valves from Galnt1 deficient animals displayed reduced levels of the proteases ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS5, decreased cleavage of the proteoglycan versican and increased levels of other extracellular matrix proteins. We also observed increased BMP and MAPK signaling. Taken together, the ablation of Galnt1 appears to disrupt the formation/remodeling of the extracellular matrix and alters conserved signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation. Our study provides insight into the role of this conserved protein modification in cardiac valve development and may represent a new model for idiopathic valve disease."

Although recent research has identified AhRs as a key contributor to bone metabolism following studies in systemic AhR knockout (KO) or transgenic mice, the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) in this process remain unclear. In this study, we explored the function of AhR in bone metabolism using AhRRANKΔOc/ΔOc (RANKCre/+;AhRflox/flox) mice. We observed enhanced bone mass together with decreased resorption in both male and female 12 and 24-week-old AhRRANKΔOc/ΔOc mice. Control mice treated with 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC), an AhR agonist, exhibited decreased bone mass and increased bone resorption, whereas AhRCtskΔOc/ΔOc (CtskCre/+;AhRflox/flox) mice injected with 3MC appeared to have a normal bone phenotype. In vitro, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from AhRRANKΔOc/ΔOc mice exhibited impaired osteoclastogenesis and repressed differentiation with downregulated expression of B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp1), and cytochrome P450 genes Cyp1b1 and Cyp1a2. Collectively, our results not only demonstrated that AhR in osteoclast lineage cells is a physiologically relevant regulator of bone resorption, but also highlighted the need for further studies on the skeletal actions of AhR inhibitors in osteoclast lineage cells commonly associated with bone diseases, especially diseases linked to environmental pollutants known to induce bone loss."
https://openalex.org/W2033289379,"Design and implementation of robust network modules is essential for construction of complex biological systems through hierarchical assembly of 'parts' and 'devices'. The robustness of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is ascribed chiefly to the underlying topology. The automatic designing capability of GRN topology that can exhibit robust behavior can dramatically change the current practice in synthetic biology. A recent study shows that Darwinian evolution can gradually develop higher topological robustness. Subsequently, this work presents an evolutionary algorithm that simulates natural evolution in silico, for identifying network topologies that are robust to perturbations. We present a Monte Carlo based method for quantifying topological robustness and designed a fitness approximation approach for efficient calculation of topological robustness which is computationally very intensive. The proposed framework was verified using two classic GRN behaviors: oscillation and bistability, although the framework is generalized for evolving other types of responses. The algorithm identified robust GRN architectures which were verified using different analysis and comparison. Analysis of the results also shed light on the relationship among robustness, cooperativity and complexity. This study also shows that nature has already evolved very robust architectures for its crucial systems; hence simulation of this natural process can be very valuable for designing robust biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W2058593648,"Objectives To examine the effects of sleep restriction on firefighters’ physical task performance during simulated wildfire suppression. Methods Thirty-five firefighters were matched and randomly allocated to either a control condition (8-hour sleep opportunity, n = 18) or a sleep restricted condition (4-hour sleep opportunity, n = 17). Performance on physical work tasks was evaluated across three days. In addition, heart rate, core temperature, and worker activity were measured continuously. Rate of perceived and exertion and effort sensation were evaluated during the physical work periods. Results There were no differences between the sleep-restricted and control groups in firefighters’ task performance, heart rate, core temperature, or perceptual responses during self-paced simulated firefighting work tasks. However, the sleep-restricted group were less active during periods of non-physical work compared to the control group. Conclusions Under self-paced work conditions, 4 h of sleep restriction did not adversely affect firefighters’ performance on physical work tasks. However, the sleep-restricted group were less physically active throughout the simulation. This may indicate that sleep-restricted participants adapted their behaviour to conserve effort during rest periods, to subsequently ensure they were able to maintain performance during the firefighter work tasks. This work contributes new knowledge to inform fire agencies of firefighters’ operational capabilities when their sleep is restricted during multi-day wildfire events. The work also highlights the need for further research to explore how sleep restriction affects physical performance during tasks of varying duration, intensity, and complexity."
https://openalex.org/W2105196519,"Background Despite its insulin sensitizing effects, pioglitazone may induce weight gain leading to an increased risk of development of insulin resistance. A novel sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, canagliflozin, provides not only glycemic control but also body weight reduction through an insulin-independent mechanism. The aim of this study was to investigate the combined effects of these agents on body weight control and insulin sensitivity. Methods Effects of combination therapy with canagliflozin and pioglitazone were evaluated in established diabetic KK-Ay mice and prediabetic Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Results In the KK-Ay mice, the combination therapy further improved glycemic control compared with canagliflozin or pioglitazone monotherapy. Furthermore, the combination significantly attenuated body weight and fat gain induced by pioglitazone and improved hyperinsulinemia. In the ZDF rats, early intervention with pioglitazone monotherapy almost completely prevented the progressive development of hyperglycemia, and no further improvement was observed by add-on treatment with canagliflozin. However, the combination significantly reduced pioglitazone-induced weight gain and adiposity and improved the Matsuda index, suggesting improved whole-body insulin sensitivity. Conclusions Our study indicates that combination therapy with canagliflozin and pioglitazone improves insulin sensitivity partly by preventing glucotoxicity and, at least partly, by attenuating pioglitazone-induced body weight gain in two different obese diabetic animal models. This combination therapy may prove to be a valuable option for the treatment and prevention of obese type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2028219269,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play a prominent role in plant nutrition by supplying mineral nutrients, particularly inorganic phosphate (Pi), and also constitute an important carbon sink. AM stimulates plant growth and development, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, Medicago truncatula plants were grown with Rhizophagus irregularis BEG141 inoculum (AM), mock inoculum (control) or with Pi fertilization. We hypothesized that AM stimulates plant growth through either modifications of leaf anatomy or photosynthetic activity per leaf area. We investigated whether these effects are shared with Pi fertilization, and also assessed the relationship between levels of AM colonization and these effects. We found that increased Pi supply by either mycorrhization or fertilization led to improved shoot growth associated with increased nitrogen uptake and carbon assimilation. Both mycorrhized and Pi-fertilized plants had more and longer branches with larger and thicker leaves than the control plants, resulting in an increased photosynthetically active area. AM-specific effects were earlier appearance of the first growth axes and increased number of chloroplasts per cell section, since they were not induced by Pi fertilization. Photosynthetic activity per leaf area remained the same regardless of type of treatment. In conclusion, the increase in growth of mycorrhized and Pi-fertilized Medicago truncatula plants is linked to an increase in the surface for sunlight capture, hence increasing their photosynthetic production, rather than to an increase in the photosynthetic activity per leaf area."
https://openalex.org/W2057834556,"Pulmonary deposited carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are cleared very slowly from the lung, but there is limited information on how CNTs interact with the lung tissue over time. To address this, three different multiwalled CNTs were intratracheally instilled into female C57BL/6 mice: one short (850 nm) and tangled, and two longer (4 μm and 5.7 μm) and thicker. We assessed the cellular interaction with these CNTs using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) 1, 3 and 28 days after instillation.TEM analysis revealed that the three CNTs followed the same overall progression pattern over time. Initially, CNTs were taken up either by a diffusion mechanism or via endocytosis. Then CNTs were agglomerated in vesicles in macrophages. Lastly, at 28 days post-exposure, evidence suggesting CNT escape from vesicle enclosures were found. The longer and thicker CNTs more often perturbed and escaped vesicular enclosures in macrophages compared to the smaller CNTs. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed that the CNT exposure induced both an eosinophil influx and also eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia.Two very different types of multiwalled CNTs had very similar pattern of cellular interactions in lung tissue, with the longer and thicker CNTs resulting in more severe effects in terms of eosinophil influx and incidence of eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia (ECP)."
https://openalex.org/W2314442389,"Microtubule-based centrioles in the centrosome mediate accurate bipolar cell division, spindle orientation, and primary cilia formation. Cellular checkpoints ensure that the centrioles duplicate only once in every cell cycle and achieve precise dimensions, dysregulation of which results in genetic instability and neuro- and ciliopathies. The normal cellular level of centrosomal protein 4.1-associated protein (CPAP), achieved by its degradation at mitosis, is considered as one of the major mechanisms that limits centriole growth at a predetermined length. Here we show that CPAP levels and centriole elongation are regulated by centrobin. Exogenous expression of centrobin causes abnormal elongation of centrioles due to massive accumulation of CPAP in the cell. Conversely, CPAP was undetectable in centrobin-depleted cells, suggesting that it undergoes degradation in the absence of centrobin. Only the reintroduction of full-length centrobin, but not its mutant form that lacks the CPAP binding site, could restore cellular CPAP levels in centrobin-depleted cells, indicating that persistence of CPAP requires its interaction with centrobin. Interestingly, inhibition of the proteasome in centrobin-depleted cells restored the cellular and centriolar CPAP expression, suggesting its ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation when centrobin is absent. Intriguingly, however, centrobin-overexpressing cells also showed proteasome-independent accumulation of ubiquitinated CPAP and abnormal, ubiquitin-positive, elongated centrioles. Overall, our results show that centrobin interacts with ubiquitinated CPAP and prevents its degradation for normal centriole elongation function. Therefore, it appears that loss of centrobin expression destabilizes CPAP and triggers its degradation to restrict the centriole length during biogenesis.

Centrosomes are the major microtubule-organizing centers of the cell and are responsible for maintaining cell shape, motility, and polarity. They also have pivotal roles in organizing an accurate bipolar spindle during normal and asymmetric cell division, spindle orientation and positioning, biogenesis of the cilia and flagella, and immune response (1Doxsey S.

Every centrosome has two centrioles, which serve as the functional hub. The two centrioles, mother and daughter, that differ in age and morphology. They are duplicated only once in every cell cycle to generate two new centrioles that are then inherited by each daughter cell. Normal dimensions and morphology are achieved by the centrioles only after passage through one-and-a-half cell cycles. The mother centriole is more mature and longer than the daughter centriole and is identified by the presence of sub-distal and distal appendages (2Nigg E.A. Raff J.W.

Hence, understanding how the centriole biogenesis is regulated and identification of the players involved may contribute to the development of therapies for these clinical conditions. In humans centriole assembly initiates at the S phase of cell cycle, and a new procentriole (daughter centriole) is generated from the proximal end of mother centriole (22Strnad P. Gönczy P.

Once this pro-centriolar protein complex is formed, centrioles are elongated to achieve a maximum length of ∼500 nm and width of ∼200 nm by the addition of α/β-tubulin heterodimers onto it (37Vorobjev I.A.

Recently, CPAP (also referred to as CENPJ) overexpression was reported to cause the centriolar microtubules to elongate beyond the predetermined length of 0.5 μm and led to accumulation of multipolar spindles (35Kohlmaier G.

Hence, identifying the cellular mechanisms that regulate CPAP expression is critical and may also uncover the role of centriole duplication during brain development. CPAP is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome during mitosis (39Tang C.J. Fu R.H. Wu K.S. Hsu W.B. Tang T.K. CPAP is a cell-cycle regulated protein that controls centriole length.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 43Kim M.K. Dudognon C. Smith S. Tankyrase 1 regulates centrosome function by controlling CPAP stability.EMBO Rep. 2012; 13: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the elongation phase of centriole duplication, which determines centriole length, is completed by the time cells reach mitosis (44Tsou M.F. Wang W.J. George K.A. Uryu K. Stearns T.

Cell. 2009; 17: 344-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Although CEP120 and SPICE1 are known to promote centriole elongation and interact with CPAP (45Comartin D. Gupta G.D. Fussner E. Coyaud É. Hasegan M. Archinti M. Cheung S.W. Pinchev D. Lawo S. Raught B. Bazett-Jones D.P. Lüders J. Pelletier L.

Therefore, identifying the upstream targets and underlying signals that govern cellular CPAP levels will shed light on how the centriole length is restricted. In this regard, we recently reported that centrobin interacts with tubulin and CPAP, and these interactions are critical during the elongation stage of centriole duplication (47Gudi R. Zou C. Li J. Gao Q. Centrobin-tubulin interaction is required for centriole elongation and stability.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 193: 711-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 48Gudi R. Zou C. Dhar J. Gao Q.

Centrobin has a crucial role in centriole assembly, bipolar mitotic spindle assembly, microtubule polymerization, and asymmetric cell division (5Januschke J. Reina J. Llamazares S. Bertran T.

Although it is considered as a daughter centriole protein, centrobin was detected on mother centrioles of G2/M-arrested cells (47Gudi R. Zou C. Li J. Gao Q. Centrobin-tubulin interaction is required for centriole elongation and stability.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 193: 711-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting that its levels are regulated on the centrioles at different stages of cell cycle. Our study, which reported that centrobin interacts with α-tubulin and is required for the stability and elongation of centrioles (47Gudi R. Zou C. Li J. Gao Q. Centrobin-tubulin interaction is required for centriole elongation and stability.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 193: 711-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), demonstrated its pivotal structural and functional roles in centriole duplication. Most importantly, our recent report also shows that direct interaction between centrobin and CPAP is responsible for the recruitment and maintenance of CPAP on the centrioles, and prevention of this interaction inhibits the CPAP-mediated elongation of centrioles. However, the molecular mechanism by which centrobin contributes to the CPAP-mediated elongation of centrioles remains unknown. In this study, for the first time we uncover a direct role for centrobin in limiting centriole length and the molecular mechanism associated with it. We show that centrobin expression levels regulate the cellular and centriolar levels of CPAP. Higher centrobin expression inhibits CPAP degradation and translates into increased ubiquitinated CPAP at the cellular and centriolar levels leading to abnormally elongated centrioles. On the other hand, reduced centrobin expression results in the destabilization and degradation of CPAP, an essential centriole elongation protein. Current observations in the context of our previous studies (47Gudi R. Zou C. Li J. Gao Q. Centrobin-tubulin interaction is required for centriole elongation and stability.J.

The GFP-C1-CPAP and pcDNA4-myc-CPAP expression constructs were kind gifts from Dr. Tang, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Taiwan. The HA-ubiquitin expressing construct was kindly provided by Dr. Beichu Guo, Medical University of South Carolina. To study the stability effect of centrobin on CPAP, 293T or U2OS cells were transfected in 24 wells for 72 h with low concentrations of myc-centrobin and control plasmids. For proteasome inhibition, cells were treated with 20 μm MG-132 (Sigma) for 14 h. Because the MG-132 stock solution was prepared in DMSO, an equivalent amount of DMSO solution was added to cells as control treatment. For visualization of centrioles, cells grown on coverslips were left on ice for half an hour to depolymerize the cytoskeletal microtubules followed by treatment with an extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose, and 0.5% Triton X-100) to enhance centriole staining and fixed with ice-cold methanol at −20 °C. The cells were then incubated with appropriate primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20 and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488/568/647-linked secondary antibodies. Coverslips were placed on slides in mounting media containing antifade and DAPI (Invitrogen), and imaging was conducted at room temperature. Images were acquired using the Olympus FV10i that has an automated scanning confocal system and is equipped with a 60× water immersion objective 1.345 n.a. Most images presented are maximum projections of Z-stacks. For mitotic spindle assay, cells were directly fixed with ice-cold methanol and stained using DAPI and α-tubulin and centrin antibodies. Images were acquired using the 60× oil objective with 1.4 n.a. of the Zeiss Axiovert Imager microscope. In pulldown experiments, cells transfected with the indicated plasmids were washed in ice-cold PBS and then lysed using immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, and 100 mm PMSF) for 40 min on ice. The DNA was sheared using a 21-gauge needle, after which lysates were spun at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. Lysates were precleared with a 50% slurry of protein A/G beads (Pierce) followed by incubation with anti-GFP antibody overnight at 4 °C and then with protein A/G beads for 1 h at 4 °C to precipitate the immune complexes. After washing six times using lysis buffer, the bound proteins were fractionated on an SDS-PAGE gel, and Western blotting was performed to detect the bound proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1967343507,"A continuous decline in the number and range of capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus L.) in many European countries can be observed, mostly due to habitat destruction by human activity, unecological forestry management, and increased density of natural predators. Ex situ in vitro gene banks provide a unique opportunity to preserve the genetic material for future generations. Simple and effective cryopreservation methods for capercaillie semen are discussed. Semen was collected from seven males kept in the Capercaillie Breeding Centre at Forestry Wisła in Poland. Within five minutes after collection, ejaculates were diluted with EK diluent, then divided into two parts, and subjected to two freezing procedures: in pellets and in straws. In fresh semen, ejaculate clearness, viscosity, color and volume, as well as sperm concentration, motility and morphology, were evaluated, while in frozen-thawed semen only motility and morphology of sperm were determined. Fertilizing ability of thawed semen was examined for samples frozen in straws. Significant (P<0.05) differences between individual males were found in relation to the majority of fresh semen traits: ejaculate volume averaged 102.1 µL (varying from 49.0 to 205.0); average sperm concentration was 632.5 x 10⁶ mL⁻¹ (178.8-1257.1); percentage of live normal cells varied from 39.2 to 70.3% (58.7% on an average); percentage of motile cells ranged from 76.0 to 85.7%) and motility parameters were male dependent, as well. Both cryopreservation methods had a negative effect on morphology and motility of frozen-thawed semen; however, the straw method yielded 60.7% and the pellet method 42.5% of live cells in total in thawed semen (P<0.05), while the number of live normal (intact) cells was similar (22.4 and 22.2%, respectively). Egg fertility varied between 77.8 and 91.7% (average 84.4%). Both freezing procedures seem to be effective in obtaining acceptable viability and high fertilizing potency of thawed sperm and can be used to create a gene bank of capercaillie semen."
https://openalex.org/W2024588084,"Aim The role of interleukin 17A (IL-17A) in the inflammatory process has caused interest in the potential significance of IL-17A as a biomarker for coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of IL-17A gene polymorphisms as susceptibility markers for CAD in the Mexican population. Methods Four IL-17A gene polymorphisms (rs8193036, rs3819024, rs2275913 and rs8193037) were genotyped by 5’ exonuclease TaqMan assays in a group of 900 patients with premature CAD and 667 healthy controls (with negative calcium score by computed tomography), seeking associations with CAD and other metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors using logistic regression analyses. Results No single IL-17A polymorphism was associated with premature CAD, however two haplotypes (CAGG and TAGA) were significantly associated with increased risk of premature CAD (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.00–1.84, P = 0.018 and OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.16–3.76, P = 0.003, respectively). Moreover, rs3819024 was associated with increased levels of visceral abdominal fat (P = 0.002) and rs8193036 was significantly associated with risk of central obesity (P = 0.020), hypertriglyceridemia (P = 0.027), and metabolic syndrome (P = 0.027) in the premature CAD group, under dominant models adjusted by age, gender, BMI, smoking history, alcohol consumption, and treatment. Conclusion The results suggest that IL-17A haplotypes are involved in the risk of developing premature CAD and some IL-17A polymorphisms are associated with cardiovascular risk factors in Mexican individuals with premature CAD."
https://openalex.org/W2061897246,"Chitin is an abundant renewable polysaccharide, next only to cellulose. Chitinases are important for effective utilization of this biopolymer. Chitinase D from Serratia proteamaculans (SpChiD) is a single domain chitinase with both hydrolytic and transglycosylation (TG) activities. SpChiD had less of hydrolytic activity on insoluble polymeric chitin substrates due to the absence of auxiliary binding domains. We improved catalytic efficiency of SpChiD in degradation of insoluble chitin substrates by fusing with auxiliary domains like polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domain and chitin binding protein 21 (CBP21). Of the six different SpChiD fusion chimeras, two C-terminal fusions viz. ChiD+PKD and ChiD+CBP resulted in improved hydrolytic activity on α- and β-chitin, respectively. Time-course degradation of colloidal chitin also confirmed that these two C-terminal SpChiD fusion chimeras were more active than other chimeras. More TG products were produced for a longer duration by the fusion chimeras ChiD+PKD and PKD+ChiD+CBP."
https://openalex.org/W1963917432,"Inflammation is an important component of cancer diathesis and treatment-refractory inflammation is a feature of many chronic degenerative lung diseases. HSP90 is a 90kDa protein which functions as an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that regulates the signalling conformation and expression of multiple protein client proteins especially oncogenic mediators. HSP90 inhibitors are in clinical development as cancer therapies but the myeleosuppressive and neutropenic effect of first generation geldanamycin-class inhibitors has confounded studies on the effects on HSP90 inhibitors on inflammation. To address this we assessed the ability of Ganetespib, a non-geldanamycin HSP90 blocker, to suppress lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cellular infiltrates, proteases and inflammatory mediator and transcriptional profiles. Ganetespib (10–100mg/kg, i.v.) did not directly cause myelosuppression, as assessed by video micrography and basal blood cell count, but it strongly and dose-dependently suppressed LPS-induced neutrophil mobilization into blood and neutrophil- and mononuclear cell-rich steroid-refractory lung inflammation. Ganetespib also suppressed B cell and NK cell accumulation, inflammatory cytokine and chemokine induction and MMP9 levels. These data identify non-myelosuppresssive HSP90 inhibitors as potential therapies for inflammatory diseases refractory to conventional therapy, in particular those of the lung."

After a twenty-year intervention, the cost per DALY averted is estimated to be $10,383 and $9,757, respectively--a 6% reduction, given the additional benefit of reduced HSV-2 acquisition. If all couples are discordant for both HIV-1 and HSV-2, the cost per DALY averted falls to $1,445, which shows that the impact is limited by HSV-2 concordance in couples.After a 20-year PrEP intervention, the cost per DALY averted with a reduction in HSV-2 is estimated to be modestly lower than without any effect, providing an increase of health benefits in addition to HIV-1 prevention at no extra cost. The small degree of the effect is in part due to a high prevalence of HSV-2 infection in HIV-1 serodiscordant couples in South Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2052017312,"The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins or transporters constitute a large protein family in plants and are involved in many different cellular functions and processes, including solute transportation, channel regulation and molecular switches, etc. Through transcriptome sequencing, a transcriptome-wide survey and expression analysis of the ABC protein genes were carried out using the laticiferous latex from Hevea brasiliensis (rubber tree). A total of 46 putative ABC family proteins were identified in the H. brasiliensis latex. These consisted of 12 ‘full-size’, 21 ‘half-size’ and 13 other putative ABC proteins, and all of them showed strong conservation with their Arabidopsis thaliana counterparts. This study indicated that all eight plant ABC protein paralog subfamilies were identified in the H. brasiliensis latex, of which ABCB, ABCG and ABCI were the most abundant. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays demonstrated that gene expression of several latex ABC proteins was regulated by ethylene, jasmonic acid or bark tapping (a wound stress) stimulation, and that HbABCB15, HbABCB19, HbABCD1 and HbABCG21 responded most significantly of all to the abiotic stresses. The identification and expression analysis of the latex ABC family proteins could facilitate further investigation into their physiological involvement in latex metabolism and rubber biosynthesis by H. brasiliensis."
https://openalex.org/W2085537532,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are the most relevant and continual source of severe infectious respiratory complications in humans and different animal species, especially poultry. Therefore, an efficient vaccination that elicits protective and neutralizing antibodies against the viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) is an important strategy to counter annual epidemics or occasional pandemics. With the help of plasmid-based reverse genetics technology, it is possible that IAV vaccine strains (IVVS) are rapidly generated. However, the genetic instability of some cloned HA-cDNAs after transformation into competent bacteria represents a major obstacle. Herein, we report efficient cloning strategies of different genetically volatile HA segments (H5- and H9-subtypes) employing either a newly constructed vector for reverse genetics (pMKPccdB) or by the use of the Escherichia coli strain HB101. Both approaches represent improved and generalizable strategies to establish functional reverse genetics systems preventing genetic changes to the cloned (HA) segments of IAV facilitating more efficient rescue of recombinant IAV for basic research and vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2035873223,"A number of studies have explored the time course of Chinese semantic and syntactic processing. However, whether syntactic processing occurs earlier than semantics during Chinese sentence reading is still under debate. To further explore this issue, an event-related potentials (ERPs) experiment was conducted on 21 native Chinese speakers who read individually-presented Chinese simple sentences (NP1+VP+NP2) word-by-word for comprehension and made semantic plausibility judgments. The transitivity of the verbs was manipulated to form three types of stimuli: congruent sentences (CON), sentences with a semantically violated NP2 following a transitive verb (semantic violation, SEM), and sentences with a semantically violated NP2 following an intransitive verb (combined semantic and syntactic violation, SEM+SYN). The ERPs evoked from the target NP2 were analyzed by using the Residue Iteration Decomposition (RIDE) method to reconstruct the ERP waveform blurred by trial-to-trial variability, as well as by using the conventional ERP method based on stimulus-locked averaging. The conventional ERP analysis showed that, compared with the critical words in CON, those in SEM and SEM+SYN elicited an N400–P600 biphasic pattern. The N400 effects in both violation conditions were of similar size and distribution, but the P600 in SEM+SYN was bigger than that in SEM. Compared with the conventional ERP analysis, RIDE analysis revealed a larger N400 effect and an earlier P600 effect (in the time window of 500–800 ms instead of 570–810ms). Overall, the combination of conventional ERP analysis and the RIDE method for compensating for trial-to-trial variability confirmed the non-significant difference between SEM and SEM+SYN in the earlier N400 time window. Converging with previous findings on other Chinese structures, the current study provides further precise evidence that syntactic processing in Chinese does not occur earlier than semantic processing."
https://openalex.org/W2012088697,"The development of neutralizing anti-factor VIII (FVIII) antibodies complicates the treatment of many hemophilia A patients. The C-terminal C2 domain is a particularly antigenic FVIII region. A crystal structure of recombinant FVIII-C2 bound to an Fab fragment of the patient-derived monoclonal antibody BO2C11, which recognizes an immunodominant inhibitor epitope on FVIII and blocks its ability to bind von Willebrand factor (VWF) and phospholipids, revealed that 15 amino acids in FVIII contact this antibody. Forty-three recombinant FVIII-C2 proteins, each with a surface-exposed side chain mutated to alanine or another residue, were generated, and surface plasmon resonance studies were carried out to evaluate effects of these substitutions on BO2C11/FVIII-C2 binding affinity. Thermodynamic analysis of experiments carried out at three temperatures indicated that one beta hairpin turn at the antigen-antibody interface (FVIII-F2196, N2198, M2199 and F2200) plus two non-contiguous arginines (FVIII-R2215 and R2220), contributed appreciably to the affinity. B-domain-deleted (BDD) FVIII-F2196A, FVIII-F2196K and FVIII-M2199A were generated and characterized. Their pro-coagulant activities and binding to VWF were similar to those of WT-BDD-FVIII, and FVIII-F2196K avoided neutralization by BO2C11 and murine inhibitory mAb 1B5. This study suggests specific sites for amino acid substitutions to rationally design FVIII variants capable of evading immunodominant neutralizing anti-FVIII antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2074220474,"Neuroblastomas (NBL) and Ewing’s sarcomas (EWS) together cause 18% of all pediatric cancer deaths. Though there is growing interest in targeting the dysregulated metabolism of cancer as a therapeutic strategy, this approach has not been fully examined in NBL and EWS. In this study, we first tested a panel of metabolic inhibitors and identified the glutamine antagonist 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) as the most potent chemotherapeutic across all NBL and EWS cell lines tested. Myc, a master regulator of metabolism, is commonly overexpressed in both of these pediatric malignancies and recent studies have established that Myc causes cancer cells to become “addicted” to glutamine. We found DON strongly inhibited tumor growth of multiple tumor lines in mouse xenograft models. In vitro, inhibition of caspases partially reversed the effects of DON in high Myc expressing cell lines, but not in low Myc expressing lines. We further showed that induction of apoptosis by DON in Myc-overexpressing cancers is via the pro-apoptotic factor Bax. To relieve inhibition of Bax, we tested DON in combination with the Bcl-2 family antagonist navitoclax (ABT-263). In vitro, this combination caused an increase in DON activity across the entire panel of cell lines tested, with synergistic effects in two of the N-Myc amplified neuroblastoma cell lines. Our study supports targeting glutamine metabolism to treat Myc overexpressing cancers, such as NBL and EWS, particularly in combination with Bcl-2 family antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W2047660016,"The proliferation, differentiation, and migration of keratinocytes are essential in the early stages of wound healing. Hypoxia-Reoxygenation (H/R) injury to keratinocytes can occur in various stressful environments such as surgery, trauma, and various forms of ulcers. The effects of remifentanil on human keratinocytes under hypoxia-reoxygenation have not been fully studied. Therefore, we investigated the effects of remifentanil on the proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagic activation of human keratinocytes during hypoxic-reoxygenation. Human keratinocytes were cultured under 1% oxygen tension for 24 h. The cells were then treated with various concentrations of remifentanil (0.01, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 ng/mL) for 2 h. Thereafter, the cells were reoxygenated for 12 h at 37°C. We measured cell viability via MTT assay. Using quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis, we measured the expression levels of proteins associated with apoptosis and autophagy. Quantification of apoptotic cells was performed using flow cytometer analysis and autophagic vacuoles were observed under a fluorescence microscope. Remifentanil treatment brought about an increase in the proliferation of human keratinocytes damaged by hypoxia-reoxygenation and decreased the apoptotic cell death, enhancing autophagic activity. However, the autophagy pathway inhibitor 3-MA inhibited the protective effect of remifentanil in hypoxia-reoxygenation injury. In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that remifentanil treatment stimulated autophagy and reduced apoptotic cell death in a hypoxia-reoxygenation model of human keratinocytes. Our results provide additional insights into the relationship between apoptosis and autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2067764964,"It has been suggested that a latitudinal gradient exists of a low density of snags and high density of naturally-formed tree-cavities in tropical vs. temperate forests, though few cavities may have characteristics suitable for nesting by birds. We determined snag and cavity density, characteristics, and suitability for birds in a tropical dry forest biome of western Mexico, and evaluated whether our data fits the trend of snag and cavity density typically found in tropical moist and wet forests. We established five 0.25-ha transects to survey and measure tree-cavities and snags in each of three vegetation types of deciduous, semi-deciduous, and mono-dominant Piranhea mexicana forest, comprising a total of 3.75 ha. We found a high density of 77 cavities/ha, with 37 cavities suitable for birds/ha, where density, and characteristics of cavities varied significantly among vegetation types. Lowest abundance of cavities occurred in deciduous forest, and these were in smaller trees, at a lower height, and with a narrower entrance diameter. Only 8.6% of cavities were excavated by woodpeckers, and only 11% of cavities were occupied, mainly by arthropods, though 52% of all cavities were unsuitable for birds. We also found a high density of 56 snags/ha, with greatest density in deciduous forest (70 snags/ha), though these were of significantly smaller diameter, and snags of larger diameter were more likely to contain cavities. The Chamela-Cuixmala tropical dry forest had the highest density of snags recorded for any tropical or temperate forest, and while snag density was significantly correlated with mean snag dbh, neither latitude nor mean dbh predicted snag density in ten forest sites. The high spatial aggregation of snag and cavity resources in tropical dry forest may limit their availability, particularly for large-bodied cavity adopters, and highlights the importance of habitat heterogeneity in providing resources for primary and secondary cavity-nesters."
https://openalex.org/W2088740607,"Background Brucellosis presents a significant economic burden for China because it causes reproductive failure in host species and chronic health problems in humans. These problems can involve multiple organs. Brucellosis is highly endemic in Shanxi Province China. Molecular typing would be very useful to epidemiological surveillance. The purpose of this study was to assess the diversity of Brucella melitensis strains for epidemiological surveillance. Historical monitoring data suggest that Brucella melitensis biovar 3 is the predominant strain associated with the epidemic of brucellosis in Shanxi Province. Methods/Principal Findings Multiple-locus variable-number repeat analysis (MLVA-16) and hypervariable octameric oligonucleotide fingerprinting (HOOF-print) were used to type a human-hosted Brucella melitensis population (81 strains). Sixty-two MLVA genotypes (discriminatory index: 0.99) were detected, and they had a genetic similarity coefficient ranging from 84.9% to 100%. Eighty strains of the population belonged to the eastern Mediterranean group with panel 1 genotypes 42 (79 strains) and 43 (1 strain). A new panel 1 genotype was found in this study. It was named 114 MLVAorsay genotype and it showed similarity to the two isolates from Guangdong in a previous study. Brucella melitensis is distributed throughout Shanxi Province, and like samples from Inner Mongolia, the eastern Mediterranean genotype 42 was the main epidemic strain (97%). The HOOF-printing showed a higher diversity than MLVA-16 with a genetic similarity coefficient ranging from 56.8% to 100%. Conclusions According to the MLVA-16 and HOOF-printing results, both methods could be used for the epidemiological surveillance of brucellosis. A new genotype was found in both Shanxi and Guangdong Provinces. In areas with brucellosis, the MLVA-16 scheme is very important for tracing cases back to their origins during outbreak investigations. It may facilitate the expansion and eradication of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2003411305,"Background and Objectives To provide proof-of-concept for the validity of the Wii Balance Board (WBB) measures to predict the type of walking aids required by inpatients with a recent (≤4days) total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Methods A cross-sectional sample of 89 inpatients (mean age, 67.0±8years) with TKA was analyzed. A multivariable proportional odds prediction model was constructed using 8 pre-specified predictors – namely, age, sex, body mass index, knee pain, knee range-of-motion, active knee lag, and WBB-derived standing balance. The type of walking aids prescribed on day 4 post-surgery was the outcome of interest – an ordinal variable with 4 categories (walking stick, narrow- and broad-base quadstick, and walking frame). Results Women, increasing body mass index, and poorer standing balance were independently associated with greater odds for requiring walking aids with a larger base-of-support. The concordance-index of the prediction model was 0.74. The model comprising only WBB-derived standing balance had nearly half (44%) the explanatory power of the full model. Adding WBB-derived standing balance to conventional demographic and knee variables resulted in a continuous net reclassification index of 0.60 (95%CI,0.19-1.01), predominantly due to better identification of patients who required walking aids with a large base-of-support (sensitivity gain). Conclusions The WBB was able to provide quantitative measures of standing balance which could assist healthcare professionals in prescribing the appropriate type of walking aids for patients. Further investigation is needed to assess whether using the WBB could lead to meaningful changes in clinical outcomes such as falls."
https://openalex.org/W2022296839,"The nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a promising target for drug discovery. NF-κB is a heterodimeric complex of RelA and p50 subunits that interact with the DNA, regulating the expression of several genes; its dysregulation can trigger diverse diseases including inflammation, immunodeficiency, and cancer. There is some experimental evidence, based on whole cells studies, that natural sesquiterpene lactones (Sls) can inhibit the interaction of NF-κB with DNA, by alkylating the RelA subunit via a Michael addition. In the present work, 28 natural and semisynthetic pseudoguianolides were screened as potential inhibitors of NF-κB in a biochemical assay that was designed using pure NF-κB heterodimer, pseudoguianolides and a ~1000 bp palindromic DNA fragment harboring two NF-κB recognition sequences. By comparing the relative amount of free DNA fragment to the NF-κB - DNA complex, in a routine agarose gel electrophoresis, the destabilizing effect of a compound on the complex is estimated. The results of the assay and the following structure-activity relationship study, allowed the identification of several relevant structural features in the pseudoguaianolide skeleton, which are necessary to enhance the dissociating capacity of NF-κB-DNA complex. The most active compounds are substituted at C-3 (α-carbonyl), in addition to having the α-methylene-γ-lactone moiety which is essential for the alkylation of RelA."

Although we have previously shown that RhBG is linked to the spectrin-based skeleton through ankyrin-G and that its NH3 transport activity is dependent on this association, there is no evidence for an interaction of kAE1 with this adaptor protein. We report here that the kAE1 cytoplasmic N terminus actually binds to ankyrin-G, both in yeast two-hybrid analysis and by coimmunoprecipitation in situ in HEK293 cells expressing recombinant kAE1. A site-directed mutagenesis study allowed the identification of three dispersed regions on kAE1 molecule linking the third and fourth repeat domains of ankyrin-G. One secondary docking site corresponds to a major interacting loop of the erythroid anion exchanger 1 (eAE1) with ankyrin-R, whereas the main binding region of kAE1 does not encompass any eAE1 determinant. Stopped flow spectrofluorometry analysis of recombinant HEK293 cells revealed that the Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity of a kAE1 protein mutated on the ankyrin-G binding site was abolished. This disruption impaired plasma membrane expression of kAE1 leading to total retention on cytoplasmic structures in polarized epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney cell transfectants. kAE1 also directly interacts with RhBG without affecting its surface expression and NH3 transport function. This is the first description of a structural and functional RhBG·kAE1·ankyrin-G complex at the plasma membrane of kidney epithelial cells, comparable with the well known Rh·eAE1·ankyrin-R complex in the red blood cell membrane. This renal complex could participate in the regulation of acid-base homeostasis."

However, it is scarcely known the influence of essential minerals other than Na in diet preferences. Moreover, almost no information is available about the possible influence of toxic levels of essential minerals on avoidance of certain plant species. The aim of this research was to test the relative importance of mineral content of plants in diet selection by red deer (Cervus elaphus) in an annual basis. We determined mineral, protein and ash content in 35 common Mediterranean plant species (the most common ones in the study area). These plant species were previously classified as preferred and non-preferred. We found that deer preferred plants with low contents of Ca, Mg, K, P, S, Cu, Sr and Zn. The model obtained was greatly accurate identifying the preferred plant species (91.3% of correct assignments). After a detailed analysis of these minerals (considering deficiencies and toxicity levels both in preferred and non-preferred plants) we suggest that the avoidance of excessive sulphur in diet (i.e., selection for plants with low sulphur content) seems to override the maximization for other nutrients. Low sulphur content seems to be a forgotten factor with certain relevance for explaining diet selection in deer. Recent studies in livestock support this conclusion, which is highlighted here for the first time in diet selection by a wild large herbivore. Our results suggest that future studies should also take into account the toxicity levels of minerals as potential drivers of preferences."
https://openalex.org/W2069326142,"Porcine oocytes that have matured in in vitro conditions undergo the process of aging during prolonged cultivation, which is manifested by spontaneous parthenogenetic activation, lysis or fragmentation of aged oocytes. This study focused on the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the process of porcine oocyte aging. H2S is a gaseous signaling molecule and is produced endogenously by the enzymes cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST). We demonstrated that H2S-producing enzymes are active in porcine oocytes and that a statistically significant decline in endogenous H2S production occurs during the first day of aging. Inhibition of these enzymes accelerates signs of aging in oocytes and significantly increases the ratio of fragmented oocytes. The presence of exogenous H2S from a donor (Na2S.9H2O) significantly suppressed the manifestations of aging, reversed the effects of inhibitors and resulted in the complete suppression of oocyte fragmentation. Cultivation of aging oocytes in the presence of H2S donor positively affected their subsequent embryonic development following parthenogenetic activation. Although no unambiguous effects of exogenous H2S on MPF and MAPK activities were detected and the intracellular mechanism underlying H2S activity remains unclear, our study clearly demonstrates the role of H2S in the regulation of porcine oocyte aging."
https://openalex.org/W2108222958,"European red deer (Cervus elaphus elaphus) are susceptible to the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, one of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, when challenged intracerebrally but their susceptibility to alimentary challenge, the presumed natural route of transmission, is unknown. To determine this, eighteen deer were challenged via stomach tube with a large dose of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy agent and clinical signs, gross and histological lesions, presence and distribution of abnormal prion protein and the attack rate recorded. Only a single animal developed clinical disease, and this was acute with both neurological and respiratory signs, at 1726 days post challenge although there was significant (27.6%) weight loss in the preceding 141 days. The clinically affected animal had histological lesions of vacuolation in the neuronal perikaryon and neuropil, typical of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Abnormal prion protein, the diagnostic marker of transmissible encephalopathies, was primarily restricted to the central and peripheral nervous systems although a very small amount was present in tingible body macrophages in the lymphoid patches of the caecum and colon. Serial protein misfolding cyclical amplification, an in vitro ultra-sensitive diagnostic technique, was positive for neurological tissue from the single clinically diseased deer. All other alimentary challenged deer failed to develop clinical disease and were negative for all other investigations. These findings show that transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy to European red deer via the alimentary route is possible but the transmission rate is low. Additionally, when deer carcases are subjected to the same regulations that ruminants in Europe with respect to the removal of specified offal from the human food chain, the zoonotic risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the cause of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, from consumption of venison is probably very low."
https://openalex.org/W2069243352,"The motion after-effect (MAE) persists in crowding conditions, i.e., when the adaptation direction cannot be reliably perceived. The MAE originating from complex moving patterns spreads into non-adapted sectors of a multi-sector adapting display (i.e., phantom MAE). In the present study we used global rotating patterns to measure the strength of the conventional and phantom MAEs in crowded and non-crowded conditions, and when attention was directed to the adapting stimulus and when it was diverted away from the adapting stimulus. The results show that: (i) the phantom MAE is weaker than the conventional MAE, for both non-crowded and crowded conditions, and when attention was focused on the adapting stimulus and when it was diverted from it, (ii) conventional and phantom MAEs in the crowded condition are weaker than in the non-crowded condition. Analysis conducted to assess the effect of crowding on high-level of motion adaptation suggests that crowding is likely to affect the awareness of the adapting stimulus rather than degrading its sensory representation, (iii) for high-level of motion processing the attentional manipulation does not affect the strength of either conventional or phantom MAEs, neither in the non-crowded nor in the crowded conditions. These results suggest that high-level MAEs do not depend on attention and that at high-level of motion adaptation the effects of crowding are not modulated by attention."
https://openalex.org/W2111840921,"Nerve injury induces a state of prolonged thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity in the innervated area, causing distress in affected individuals. Nerve injury-induced hypersensitivity is partially due to increased activity and thereby sustained release of neurotransmitters from the injured fibers. Glutamate, a prominent neurotransmitter in primary afferents, plays a major role in development of hypersensitivity. Glutamate is packed in vesicles by vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) to enable controlled release upon depolarization. While a role for peripheral VGLUTs in nerve injury-induced pain is established, their contribution in specific peripheral neuronal populations is unresolved. We investigated the role of VGLUT2, expressed by transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV1) fibers, in nerve injury-induced hypersensitivity. Our data shows that removal of Vglut2 from Trpv1-Cre neurons using transgenic mice abolished both heat and punctuate hyperalgesia associated with nerve injury. In contrast, the development of cold hypersensitivity after nerve injury was unaltered. Here, we show that, VGLUT2-mediated glutamatergic transmission from Trpv1-Cre neurons selectively mediates heat and mechanical hypersensitivity associated with nerve injury. Our data clarifies the role of the Trpv1-Cre population and the dependence of VGLUT2-mediated glutamatergic transmission in nerve injury-induced hyperalgesia."
https://openalex.org/W2107526997,"Background Perception of speech is crucial in school where speech is the main mode of communication. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether a web based approach including listening tests and questionnaires could be used as a screening tool for poor classroom acoustics. The prime focus was the relation between pupils’ comprehension of speech, the classroom acoustics and their description of the acoustic qualities of the classroom. Methodology/Principal Findings In total, 1106 pupils aged 13-19, from 59 classes and 38 schools in Sweden participated in a listening study using Hagerman’s sentences administered via Internet. Four listening conditions were applied: high and low background noise level and positions close and far away from the loudspeaker. The pupils described the acoustic quality of the classroom and teachers provided information on the physical features of the classroom using questionnaires. Conclusions/Significance In 69% of the classes, at least three pupils described the sound environment as adverse and in 88% of the classes one or more pupil reported often having difficulties concentrating due to noise. The pupils’ comprehension of speech was strongly influenced by the background noise level (p<0.001) and distance to the loudspeakers (p<0.001). Of the physical classroom features, presence of suspended acoustic panels (p<0.05) and length of the classroom (p<0.01) predicted speech comprehension. Of the pupils’ descriptions of acoustic qualities, clattery significantly (p<0.05) predicted speech comprehension. Clattery was furthermore associated to difficulties understanding each other, while the description noisy was associated to concentration difficulties. The majority of classrooms do not seem to have an optimal sound environment. The pupil’s descriptions of acoustic qualities and listening tests can be one way of predicting sound conditions in the classroom."
https://openalex.org/W1992654192,"The p21-activated kinase 3 (PAK3) and the serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 2 (SGK2) have been previously proposed as essential kinases for human papillomavirus positive (HPV+) cervical cancer cell survival. This was established using a shRNA knockdown approach. To validate PAK3 and SGK2 as potential targets for HPV+ cervical cancer therapy, the relationship between shRNA-induced phenotypes in HPV+ cervical cancer cells and PAK3 or SGK2 knockdown was carefully examined. We observed that the phenotypes of HPV+ cervical cancer cells induced by various PAK3 and SGK2 shRNAs could not be rescued by complement expression of respective cDNA constructs. A knockdown-deficient PAK3 shRNA with a single mismatch was sufficient to inhibit HeLa cell growth to a similar extent as wild-type PAK3 shRNA. The HPV+ cervical cancer cells were also susceptible to several non-human target shRNAs. The discrepancy between PAK3 and SGK2 shRNA-induced apoptosis and gene expression knockdown, as well as cell death stimulation, suggested that these shRNAs killed HeLa cells through different pathways that may not be target-specific. These data demonstrated that HPV+ cervical cancer cell death was not associated with RNAi-induced PAK3 and SGK2 knockdown but likely through off-target effects."
https://openalex.org/W1978627263,"Purpose The aim of this study was to design a method of radionuclide for imaging and therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) using the transferred human sodium/iodide symporter (hNIS) gene. Methods A stable NPC cell line expressing hNIS was established (CNE-2-hNIS). After 131I treatment, we detected proliferation and apoptosis of NPC cells, both in vitro and vivo. In vivo, the radioactivity of different organs of nude mice was counted and 99mTc imaging using SPECT was performed. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value changes of tumor xenografts were observed by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) within 6–24 days of 131I treatment. The correlation of ADC changes with apoptosis and proliferation was investigated. Post-treatment expression levels of P53, Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, and Survivin proteins were detected by western blotting. Results 131I uptake was higher in CNE-2-hNIS than in CNE-2 cells. The proliferation and apoptosis rate decreased and increased respectively both in vitro and vivo in the experimental group after 131I treatment. The experimental group tumors accumulated 99mTc in vivo, leading to a good visualization by SPECT. DW-MRI showed that ADC values increased in the experimental group 6 days after treatment, while ADC values were positively and negatively correlated with the apoptotic and Ki-67 proliferation indices, respectively. After treatment, CNE-2-hNIS cells up-regulated the expression of P53 and Survivin proteins and activated Caspase-3, and down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2 proteins. Conclusions The radionuclide imaging and therapy technique for NPC hNIS-transfected cell lines can provide a new therapy strategy for monitoring and treatment of NPC."
https://openalex.org/W2021010770,"Identification of susceptibility genes for essential hypertension in humans has been a challenge due to its multifactorial pathogenesis complicated by gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, developmental programing and sex specific differences. These concurrent features make identification of causal hypertension susceptibility genes with a single approach difficult, thus requiring multiple lines of evidence involving genetic, biochemical and biological experimentation to establish causal functional mutations. Here we report experimental evidence encompassing genetic, biochemical and in vivo modeling that altogether support ATP1A1 as a hypertension susceptibility gene in males in Sardinia, Italy. ATP1A1 encodes the α1Na,K-ATPase isoform, the sole sodium pump in vascular endothelial and renal tubular epithelial cells. DNA-sequencing detected a 12-nucleotide long thymidine (12T) insertion(ins)/deletion(del) polymorphism within a poly-T sequence (38T vs 26T) in the ATP1A1 5’-regulatory region associated with hypertension in a male Sardinian population. The 12T-insertion allele confers decreased susceptibility to hypertension (P = 0.035; OR = 0.50 [0.28–0.93]) accounting for 12.1 mmHg decrease in systolic BP (P = 0.02) and 6.6 mmHg in diastolic BP (P = 0.046). The ATP1A1 promoter containing the 12T-insertion exhibited decreased transcriptional activity in in vitro reporter-assay systems, indicating decreased α1Na,K-ATPase expression with the 12T-insertion, compared with the 12T-deletion ATP1A1 promoter. To test the effects of decreased α1Na,K-ATPase expression on blood pressure, we measured blood pressure by radiotelemetry in three month-old, highly inbred heterozygous knockout ATP1A1+/− male mice with resultant 58% reduction in ATP1A1 protein levels. Male ATP1A1+/− mice showed significantly lower blood pressure (P < 0.03) than age-matched male wild-type littermate controls. Concordantly, lower ATP1A1 expression is expected to lower Na-reabsorption in the kidney thereby decreasing sodium-associated risk for hypertension and sodium-induced endothelial stiffness and dysfunction. Altogether, data support ATP1A1 as a hypertension susceptibility gene in a male Sardinian population, and mandate further investigation of its involvement in hypertension in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W1976547429,"RNA silencing pathways were first discovered in plants. Through genetic analysis, it has been established that the key silencing components called Dicer-like (DCL) genes have been shown to cooperatively process RNA substrates of multiple origin into distinct 21, 22 and 24 nt small RNAs. However, only few detailed biochemical analysis of the corresponding complexes has been carried out in plants, mainly due to the large unstable complexes that are hard to obtain or reconstitute in heterologous systems. Reconstitution of activity needs thorough understanding of all protein partners in the complex, something that is still an ongoing process in plant systems. Here, we use biochemical analysis to uncover properties of two previously identified native dicer-like activities from wheat germ. We find that standard wheat germ extract contains Dicer-like enzymes that convert double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into two classes of small interfering RNAs of 21 and 24 nt in size. The 21 nt dicing activity, likely an siRNA producing complex known as DCL4, is 950 kDa-1.2 mDa in size and is highly unstable during purification processes but has a rather vast range for activity. On the contrary, the 24 nt dicing complex, likely the DCL3 activity, is relatively stable and comparatively smaller in size, but has stricter conditions for effective processing of dsRNA substrates. While both activities could process completely complementary dsRNA albeit with varying abilities, we show that DCL3-like 24 nt producing activity is equally good in processing incompletely complementary RNAs."
