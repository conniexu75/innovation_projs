https://openalex.org/W2040180267,"Two ice cores from the col of Huascarán in the north-central Andes of Peru contain a paleoclimatic history extending well into the Wisconsinan (Würm) Glacial Stage and include evidence of the Younger Dryas cool phase. Glacial stage conditions at high elevations in the tropics appear to have been as much as 8 degrees to 12 degrees C cooler than today, the atmosphere contained about 200 times as much dust, and the Amazon Basin forest cover may have been much less extensive. Differences in both the oxygen isotope ratio zeta(18)O (8 per mil) and the deuterium excess (4.5 per mil) from the Late Glacial Stage to the Holocene are comparable with polar ice core records. These data imply that the tropical Atlantic was possibly 5 degrees to 6 degrees C cooler during the Late Glacial Stage, that the climate was warmest from 8400 to 5200 years before present, and that it cooled gradually, culminating with the Little Ice Age (200 to 500 years before present). A strong warming has dominated the last two centuries."

Present-day ecological heterogeneity within tierra firme has hardly been discussed in this context, although edaphic differences are known to affect species distribution patterns in both inundated areas and tierra firme. Quantification of landscape heterogeneity in Peruvian Iowland Amazonia (500,000 kilometers squared), based on field studies and satellite image analysis, shows that Peruvian Amazonia is considerably more heterogeneous than previously reported. These observations have implications for the research, management, and conservation of Amazonian biodiversity."

From late October 1994, the beginning of the observation, to the end of December 1994, radon concentration increased about fourfold. On 8 January, 9 days before the earthquake, the radon concentration reached a peak of more than 10 times that at the beginning of the observation, before starting to decrease. These radon changes are likely to be precursory phenomena of the disastrous earthquake."
https://openalex.org/W2072843675,Chloride (Cl(-)) and sulfate (SO(4)(2-)) ion concentrations of ground water issuing from two wells located near the epicenter of the Kobe earthquake in Japan fluctuated before the disastrous magnitude 7.2 event on 17 January 1995. The samples measured were pumped ground water packed in bottles and distributed in the domestic market as drinking water from 1993 to April 1995. Analytical results demonstrate that Cl(-)and SO(4)(2-) concentrations increased steadily from August 1994 to just before the earthquake. Water sampled after the earthquake showed much higher Cl(-) and SO(4)(2-) concentrations. The precursory changes in chemical composition may reflect the preparation stage of a large earthquake.
https://openalex.org/W2026775756,"Amorphous iron sulfide minerals containing either 500 or 3000 iron atoms in each cluster have been synthesized in situ within the nanodimensional cavity of horse spleen ferritin. Iron-57 Mössbauer spectroscopy indicated that most of the iron atoms in the 3000-iron atom cores are trivalent, whereas in the 500-iron atom clusters, approximately 50 percent of the iron atoms are Fe(III), with the remaining atoms having an effective oxidation state of about +2.5. Iron K-edge extended x-ray absorption fine structure data for the 500-iron atom nanocomposite are consistent with a disordered array of edge-shared FeS(4) tetrahedra, connected by Fe(S)(2)Fe bridges with bond lengths similar to those of the cubane-type motif of iron-sulfur clusters. The approach used here for the controlled synthesis of bioinorganic nanocomposites could be useful for the nanoscale engineering of dispersed materials with biocompatible and bioactive properties."

Geometric and morphological characteristics suggest that the bands represent Earth-like tectonic deformational features, such as folds and faults."
https://openalex.org/W1973950873,"The dynamics of the carbonium ion (CH(5)(+)), a highly reactive intermediate with no equilibrium structure, was studied by measuring the infrared spectra for internally cold CH(5)(+)(H(2))n(n = 1, 2, 3) stored in an ion trap. First-principle molecular dynamics methods were used to directly simulate the internal motion for these ionic complexes. The combined experimental and theoretical efforts substantiated the anticipated scrambling motion in the CH(5)(+) core and revealed the effect of the solvent molecular hydrogen in slowing down the scrambling. The results indicate the feasibility of using solvent molecules to stabilize the floppy CH(5)(+) ion in order to make it amenable to spectroscopic study."

There have been extraordinary rates of growth in the transmission of electronic communications, but much lower rates of growth in the material that people actually consume, representing the phenomenon often labeled information overload. Growth in print media has sharply decelerated, and a close relationship is found between the cheapness of a medium and its rate of growth."

https://openalex.org/W2075701622,"The Supreme Court may soon be asked to decide an important issue of First Amendment law arising from the government's efforts to restrict the dissemination of ""militarily critical"" technological knowledge. To resolve the issue, the Court will first determine whether technological knowledge qualifies for a full measure of protection under the free-speech clause of the First Amendment. The Court will then address the government's stated justification for restricting the contested information. This inquiry will evaluate both the gravity of the asserted danger to national security and the likelihood of its occurrence."

Chemical markers in the ice of the two cores (160 and 166 meters long), covering 20,000 years, are starting to provide detailed support for understanding the ice age in the tropics. they show that climate in the tropics experience sharp oscillations at the end of the ice ages as it did in more northerly regions. Information about El Ninos and how the tropics respond to global climate changes is forthcoming. Comments on the actual expedition to obtain the ice cores are included."

Thresher (1 Oct. 1982, p. 70) were uniformly too large by a factor of 4. In figure 1 (p. 71), the scale on the abscissa for the size-frequency distribution of pomacentrin eggs should be 0 to 1.0 cubic millimeters, rather than 0 to 4.0 mm(3), and the average egg volumes for western Atlantic and western Pacific species are, respectively, 0.165 mm(3) and 0.46 mm(3). The error affects neither the distributions of egg volumes in the two areas nor the magnitude nor significance level of the differences between them."
