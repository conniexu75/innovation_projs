https://openalex.org/W2057595177,"The possible ecological effects of climate change are often in the news, as is the matter of whether the potential impact can be predicted. New work on a migratory bird, the pied flycatcher, takes things a stage further by showing how a climate-related population decline was actually caused. Timing is key. Over the past 17 years flycatchers declined strongly in areas where caterpillar numbers (food for the nestlings) peak early, but in areas with a late food peak there was no decline. The young birds arrive too late where caterpillars have responded to early warmth. Mistiming like this is probably a common consequence of climate change, and may be a major factor in the decline of many long-distance migratory bird species. Phenological responses to climate change differ across trophic levels1,2,3, which may lead to birds failing to breed at the time of maximal food abundance. Here we investigate the population consequences of such mistiming in the migratory pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca4. In a comparison of nine Dutch populations, we find that populations have declined by about 90% over the past two decades in areas where the food for provisioning nestlings peaks early in the season and the birds are currently mistimed. In areas with a late food peak, early-breeding birds still breed at the right time, and there is, at most, a weak population decline. If food phenology advances further, we also predict population declines in areas with a late food peak, as in these areas adjustment to an advanced food peak is insufficient4. Mistiming as a result of climate change is probably a widespread phenomenon1, and here we provide evidence that it can lead to population declines."
https://openalex.org/W2057308155,"CNS deletion of Pten in the mouse has revealed its roles in controlling cell size and number, thus providing compelling etiology for macrocephaly and Lhermitte-Duclos disease. PTEN mutations in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have also been reported, although a causal link between PTEN and ASD remains unclear. In the present study, we deleted Pten in limited differentiated neuronal populations in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice. Resulting mutant mice showed abnormal social interaction and exaggerated responses to sensory stimuli. We observed macrocephaly and neuronal hypertrophy, including hypertrophic and ectopic dendrites and axonal tracts with increased synapses. This abnormal morphology was associated with activation of the Akt/mTor/S6k pathway and inactivation of Gsk3beta. Thus, our data suggest that abnormal activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in specific neuronal populations can underlie macrocephaly and behavioral abnormalities reminiscent of certain features of human ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2111873046,"We examined anticipatory mechanisms of reward-motivated memory formation using event-related FMRI. In a monetary incentive encoding task, cues signaled high- or low-value reward for memorizing an upcoming scene. When tested 24 hr postscan, subjects were significantly more likely to remember scenes that followed cues for high-value rather than low-value reward. A monetary incentive delay task independently localized regions responsive to reward anticipation. In the encoding task, high-reward cues preceding remembered but not forgotten scenes activated the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, and hippocampus. Across subjects, greater activation in these regions predicted superior memory performance. Within subject, increased correlation between the hippocampus and ventral tegmental area was associated with enhanced long-term memory for the subsequent scene. These findings demonstrate that brain activation preceding stimulus encoding can predict declarative memory formation. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that reward motivation promotes memory formation via dopamine release in the hippocampus prior to learning.

These findings demonstrate that brain activation preceding stimulus encoding can predict declarative memory formation. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that reward motivation promotes memory formation via dopamine release in the hippocampus prior to learning. The motivation to learn refers to a desire to gain knowledge. It begins before that knowledge is perceived or acquired. In daily life, learning can be inspired by anticipation of remote extrinsic rewards, such as grades, admissions, and promotions; and intrinsic rewards, such as satisfaction of intellectual curiosity. In all of these cases, motivation precedes learning. This implies mechanisms unlike those for stimulus-driven learning (driven by stimulus features such as the novelty, significance, or emotional content) or feedback-driven learning (driven by outcomes that strengthen the association between a stimulus and a response). The goals of this study were to demonstrate motivated learning and to characterize neural systems that support it. We predicted that two neural systems would support motivated learning: a mesolimbic circuit involved in reward anticipation and a medial temporal lobe circuit involved in memory formation. Midbrain dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and their projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in the ventral striatum are thought to support reward anticipation. Electrophysiological research indicates that, after reward-based classical conditioning has occurred, VTA dopamine neurons fire in response to cues that predict reward (Schultz, 1998Schultz W. Predictive reward signal of dopamine neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 1-27PubMed Google Scholar) and during anticipation of reward (Fiorillo et al., 2003Fiorillo C.D. Tobler P.N. Schultz W. Discrete coding of reward probability and uncertainty by dopamine neurons.Science. 2003; 299: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). FMRI research indicates that NAcc activation increases in proportion to the magnitude of anticipated reward (Knutson et al., 2001aKnutson B. Adams C.M. Fong G.W. Hommer D. Anticipation of increasing monetary reward selectively recruits nucleus accumbens.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC159PubMed Google Scholar, Knutson et al., 2001bKnutson B. Fong G.W. Adams C.M. Varner J.L. Hommer D. Dissociation of reward anticipation and outcome with event-related fMRI.Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 3683-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). In rats, stimulating these circuits to release dopamine in the NAcc induces sniffing and other exploratory behaviors that have been likened to curiosity (Ikemoto and Panksepp, 1999Ikemoto S. Panksepp J. The role of nucleus accumbens dopamine in motivated behavior: a unifying interpretation with special reference to reward-seeking.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1999; 31: 6-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Thus, mesolimbic activation might index a motivational state that could facilitate memory formation. The medial temporal lobes (or MTL, which include the hippocampus and surrounding cortex) are thought to support declarative memory formation. Damage to the MTL results in global amnesia, which is characterized by diminished or absent declarative memory formation (Scoville and Milner, 1957Scoville W.B. Milner B. Loss of recent memory after bilateral hippocampal lesions.J. Neurochem. 1957; 20: 11-21Google Scholar, Squire, 1992Squire L.R.

The magnitude of stimulus-driven MTL activation seen with FMRI following scenes (Brewer et al., 1998Brewer J.B. Zhao Z. Desmond J.E. Glover G.H. Gabrieli J.D. Making memories: brain activity that predicts how well visual experience will be remembered.Science. 1998; 281: 1185-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar), words (Wagner et al., 1998Wagner A.D.

While not usually considered together, the medial temporal lobes and midbrain dopamine systems are anatomically and functionally related. VTA dopamine neurons directly innervate MTL regions. Intricate region- and layer-specific dopamine projections target the hippocampus (HPC) (Amaral and Cowan, 1980Amaral D.G. Cowan W.M.

Pharmacological studies suggest that dopamine can modulate MTL-dependent learning. Specifically, in animals, reduced dopamine receptor expression in the MTL (Liu et al., 2004Liu Z. Richmond B.J.

Spatial memory impairment induced by lesion of the mesohippocampal dopaminergic system in the rat.Neuroscience. 1996; 74: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) impair learning, whereas stimulation of dopamine receptors in the MTL enhances learning (Bernabeu et al., 1997Bernabeu R.

Behav. 1982; 17: 11-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Finally, FMRI studies report that novel or reward-predicting stimuli that are later remembered elicit greater midbrain activation than forgotten stimuli (Schott et al., 2004Schott B.H. Sellner D.B. Lauer C.J. Habib R. Frey J.U. Guderian S. Heinze H.J. Duzel E. Activation of midbrain structures by associative novelty and the formation of explicit memory in humans.Learn.

Reward-related FMRI activation of dopaminergic midbrain is associated with enhanced hippocampus-dependent long-term memory formation.Neuron. 2005; 45: 459-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that midbrain dopaminergic systems involved in reward anticipation could directly modulate declarative memory formation in the MTL. Two lines of physiological research suggest that midbrain modulation of declarative memory would begin even before stimulus presentation. First, dopamine lowers the threshold for long-term potentiation (LTP) if, and only if, it is already available at the synapse when neurons fire (Frey et al., 1993Frey U. Huang Y.Y. Kandel E.R. Effects of cAMP simulate a late stage of LTP in hippocampal CA1 neurons.Science. 1993; 260: 1661-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, Huang and Kandel, 1995Huang Y.Y. Kandel E.R. D1/D5 receptor agonists induce a protein synthesis-dependent late potentiation in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 2446-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, Otmakhova and Lisman, 1996Otmakhova N.A. Lisman J.E. D1/D5 dopamine receptor activation increases the magnitude of early long-term potentiation at CA1 hippocampal synapses.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7478-7486PubMed Google Scholar), implying prior release. Second, infusion of a dopamine agonist 5 min preceding, but not after, neural stimulation lowers the threshold for induction of LTP in the hippocampal area CA1 (Li et al., 2003Li S. Cullen W.K. Anwyl R. Rowan M.J. Dopamine-dependent facilitation of LTP induction in hippocampal CA1 by exposure to spatial novelty.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). These physiological findings suggest the hypothesis that, in motivated learning, VTA activity would precede and potentiate MTL memory formation. One FMRI study examined incidental memory formation for stimuli that predicted reward (Wittmann et al., 2005Wittmann B.C. Schott B.H. Guderian S. Frey J.U. Heinze H.J. Duzel E. Reward-related FMRI activation of dopaminergic midbrain is associated with enhanced hippocampus-dependent long-term memory formation.Neuron. 2005; 45: 459-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Subjects viewed line drawings of living or nonliving objects, with one set (e.g., living) cuing possible reward. After each drawing, subjects indicated whether it cued reward, then made a number judgment; on reward trials, a fast and accurate response earned money, but a slow or inaccurate response lost money. Following each number judgment, subjects saw feedback indicating gain or loss (reward trials) or no change (neutral trials). On an unexpected memory test 3 weeks later, drawings from the category that cued reward were better remembered than neutral drawings. Neutral drawings did not activate the striatum or midbrain, but reward-predicting drawings did, showing greater activation for those drawings later remembered versus forgotten (i.e., showing an interaction between reward and memory). In an MTL region extending from the hippocampus through the parahippocampal gyrus, there was greater activation for remembered versus forgotten drawings, and for reward-predicting versus neutral drawings, but no interaction between reward and memory. This study provided evidence for a link between midbrain activation and MTL-dependent memory formation. However, this FMRI study did not address whether motivated learning reflects an interaction between dopaminergic midbrain and MTL regions. First, learning was driven not by prior motivation, but rather by stimulus properties (of the reward-signaling cue itself). Second, the relation between stimulus and reward was reinforced by trial-by-trial feedback. Third, reward and memory formation interactively increased midbrain activation, but not MTL activation. Thus, neither the role of these regions in motivated learning nor the connection between midbrain and MTL activation has been established. We hypothesized that motivated learning would recruit circuitry related to reward anticipation (i.e., VTA and NAcc) preceding stimulus presentation, and circuitry related to memory formation (i.e., MTL) preceding and during stimulus presentation. Investigators have not yet documented activation that precedes a stimulus, but correlates with memory formation for that stimulus. To capture this phenomenon, we performed event-related FMRI during two tasks (Figure 1). First, we localized mesolimbic reward anticipation regions using a monetary incentive delay (MID) task (Knutson et al., 2001aKnutson B. Adams C.M. Fong G.W. Hommer D. Anticipation of increasing monetary reward selectively recruits nucleus accumbens.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC159PubMed Google Scholar, Knutson et al., 2001bKnutson B. Fong G.W. Adams C.M. Varner J.L. Hommer D. Dissociation of reward anticipation and outcome with event-related fMRI.Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 3683-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), which reliably evokes activation proportional to the amount of anticipated reward in the NAcc and midbrain (Knutson et al., 2005Knutson B. Taylor J. Kaufman M. Peterson R. Glover G. Distributed neural representation of expected value.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4806-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). In the MID task, abstract cues (i.e., circles or squares, with lines indicating amounts from $0 to $5.00) signaled that a subject could gain (or avoid losing) money by rapidly responding to a subsequently presented target; immediate feedback about reward receipt followed each target. Second, we examined reward promotion of memory formation using a monetary incentive encoding (MIE) task, which incorporated reward cues into an intentional memory-encoding paradigm. A high-value ($5.00) or low-value ($0.10) literal cue preceding each memory target indicated the reward for correctly recognizing the target amid foils on a memory test given the next day (Figure 1). Thus, the MIE task separated the motivation to learn from learning itself. Subjects obtained reward on 73% ± 6% of trials (mean ± SD). Subjects responded more slowly on the +$0.00 trials (reaction time [RT] mean ± SD: 196 ± 12 ms) than on incentive trials [ANOVA main effect of incentive: F(5,60) = 2.41, p = 0.05; Tukey's LSD pairwise comparisons −$5.00, 181 ± 7 ms, p = 0.01; −$1.00, 185 ± 13 ms, p = 0.04; +$1.00, 180 ± 15 ms, p = 0.005; +$5.00, 183 ± 8 ms, p = 0.02]. Hit rate did not vary with incentive. Accuracy and RT data for the distractor task following target scenes were submitted to a 2 (memory: high confidence recognized versus forgotten) × 2 (value: high versus low) × 3 (arrow position) ANOVA. There were no significant main effects of memory or value. Collapsed across all conditions, responses to the initial arrow were slower and less accurate [RT: F(2,10) = 55.5, p = .0001; arrow 1, 498 ± 46 ms; arrow 2, 370 ± 30 ms; arrow 3, 357 ± 24 ms; accuracy: F(2,10) = 4.15, p = 0.05; arrow 1, 81% ± 16%; arrow 2, 89% ± 12%; arrow 3, 90% ± 10%]. On low-value trials only, RT was slower after recognized versus forgotten targets, but paired comparisons were not significant [arrow × value × memory interaction on RT: F(2,10) = 5.78, p = 0.02]. On high-value trials, RT following recognized versus forgotten targets did not differ (low-value trials: forgotten, 489 ± 53 ms, recognized, 519 ± 48 ms; high-value trials: forgotten 512 ± 53 ms; recognized, 520 ± 47 ms). Twenty to 26 hours after scanning, subjects (n = 12) recognized both high-value [t(11) = 14.46, p = 1.7 × 10−8, paired, two-tailed] and low-value [t(11) = 7.30, p = 1.6 × 10−5] scenes presented in the MIE task at significantly greater rates than the false alarm rate (mean ± SD: high-value 70% ± 11%, low-value 60% ± 12%, false alarms 19% ± 10%). As expected, recognition accuracy was greater for high-reward than low-reward scenes [t(11) = 2.14, p = 0.03, one-tailed]. The reward-driven gain in recognition accuracy was due to increases in correct high-confidence responses (i.e., “Remember” and “Know” pooled), which were significantly more frequent for high- versus low- value scenes [high-value 45% ± 17%, low-value 33% ± 23%, t(11) = 2.59, p = 0.02, two-tailed]. FMRI analysis was restricted to high-confidence responses. Low-confidence response rates (i.e., “Pretty Sure” and “Guessing” pooled) were not sensitive to reward value (high-value 25% ± 8%, low-value 27% ± 8%). None of the analyzed subjects reported maintaining a cognitive strategy for preferentially remembering high-value scenes. Across subjects, high- and low-value scene recognitions were positively correlated [R2 = 0.43, t(11) = 2.7, p = 0.07], suggesting that there was not a strategic tradeoff between learning high- versus low-value stimuli. Because foils were shared for high- and low-value scenes, it is unclear if there were reward-related biases in memory judgments at test, as has been found for emotional stimuli (Sharot et al., 2004Sharot T. Delgado M.R. Phelps E.A. How emotion enhances the feeling of remembering.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Analyses focused on activations in a priori anatomical brain regions associated with reward anticipation, the VTA and NAcc, and with memory formation, the MTL. To test our main hypotheses, we defined functional regions of interest (ROIs) within these anatomical boundaries (for details on boundary demarcation, see Experimental Procedures) at peaks of activation. We extracted individual β coefficients in these ROIs for Cue and Stimulus intervals for each MIE task condition (i.e., each level of reward value [high and low] and memory outcome [recognized and forgotten]) against implicit baseline (i.e., average intensity over the time course; because data were intensity normalized prior to regression, coefficients correspond to percent signal change). We identified ROIs related to reward anticipation by finding activation peaks in clusters activated during high-value ($5) versus no-value ($0) Cue intervals of the MID task (Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online; cf. Table S2, reward effects in the MIE task). Our hypothesis was that during MIE task Cue intervals, but not Stimulus intervals, reward anticipation ROIs within the VTA and NAcc would show greater activation for remembered than forgotten items in the high-value, but not the low-value, condition.We also identified ROIs related to memory formation by finding activation peaks in clusters showing greater activation for subsequently recognized versus forgotten scenes in either the Cue or Stimulus interval. Our hypotheses were as follows. (1) Activation of some memory formation regions within the MTL would be influenced by reward, i.e., they would exhibit greater activation for remembered items over forgotten items in the high-value condition but not in the low-value condition, and (2) some MTL areas would have greater activation for high-value remembered versus forgotten trials during the Cue interval, prior to scene presentation. In addition, we used functional connectivity analysis to examine changes in correlation with VTA seed ROIs as a function of within-subject task conditions. Our hypothesis was that in the hippocampus, correlation with VTA activation would increase both following high-value (versus low-value) cues and preceding recognized (versus forgotten) high-value scenes. Finally, we examined whether memory-related activation of these functional ROIs was correlated across individuals or with individual differences in memory. We found four reward anticipation activation peaks from the MID task in the left and right VTA (Figure 2 and Figure S1), and in the left and right NAcc (Figure 2). For these independently defined ROIs, we submitted individual β coefficients from the MIE task to a 4 (region) × 2 (interval: Cue versus Stimulus) × 2 (value: high versus low) × 2 (memory: recognized versus forgotten) repeated measures ANOVA (Figure 2). In these ROIs, activation showed no main effects of region [F(3,9) = 0.65, p = 0.61] or interactions with region (all, p > 0.2) but did show significant interactions of task conditions with memory [interval × memory interaction, F(1,11) = 4.98, p = 0.047; interval × reward × memory interaction, F(1,11) = 5.83, p = 0.034, other effects p > 0.1]. These interactions reflect greater activation for recognized versus forgotten scenes only during the Cue interval, and only for high-value scenes (significant paired comparisons of recognized versus forgotten high-value Cue intervals: left [L] VTA, t = 3.12, p = 0.005; right [R] VTA, t = 2.48, p = 0.02; L NAcc, t = 2.61, p = 0.01; R NAcc, t = 2.72, p = 0.01, one-tailed). Mean and standard error of individual MIE β coefficients against implicit baseline (percent signal change units) for ROIs defined at peaks in the MID $5 versus $0 contrast in the VTA and NAcc. Asterisks denote significance of paired comparisons between recognized versus forgotten scenes (green versus gray bars, p < 0.05). Horizontal green and gray lines show means collapsed across value. For high-value scenes only, activation in all ROIs preceding (in the Cue interval), but not following (in the Stimulus interval), scene presentation predicted whether the scene would be recognized or forgotten at test the next day. Error bars indicate standard error. Although ROI definition from MID task activation peaks was independent of MIE analyses, it is possible that choosing ROIs based on activations during reward anticipation biased analyses against finding activations during low-value trials or Stimulus intervals. Whole-brain statistical maps contrasting recognized versus forgotten scenes (at each level of interval and reward value) (Table S3) could identify such activations. Whole-brain analyses did not reveal activations in the VTA or NAcc during low-value Cue intervals or during Stimulus intervals. Thus, alternate methods of defining ROIs would not change inferences about the involvement of the VTA and NAcc in memory formation. To examine memory formation effects in the MTL, we identified ROIs at activation peaks in whole-brain contrasts of recognized versus forgotten trials during either interval (Tables S3 and S4). These analyses identified five MTL memory ROIs: bilateral anterior hippocampus (“HPC,” activated in the Cue interval), right entorhinal cortex (“Ento,” activated in the Cue interval), and bilateral posterior parahippocampal cortex (“pPHC,” activated in the Stimulus interval). We submitted individual β coefficients to 2 (value: high versus low) × 2 (memory: recognized versus forgotten) repeated measures ANOVAs, separately for Cue and Stimulus intervals, to examine reward value effects on memory-related activation. In this analysis, some ROIs exhibited significant activations not seen in the whole-brain analysis, which used more conservative thresholds and cluster size criteria to correct for multiple comparisons. The L HPC (Figure 3) showed greater activation for recognized versus forgotten high-value scenes during the Cue interval [memory main effect, Cue interval: F(1,11) = 9.25, p = 0.01; value × memory interaction: F(1,11) = 5.66, p = 0.04; significant paired comparison of recognized versus forgotten high-value Cue intervals: t(11) = 3.51, p = 0.0025, one-tailed]. In the ROI analysis, this region also showed significantly greater activation for all recognized scenes during the Stimulus interval [significant memory main effect: F(1,11) = 5.39, p = 0.04]. The R HPC (Figure 3) showed greater activation for recognized versus forgotten high-value scenes only during the Cue interval [significant ANOVA memory main effect, Cue interval: F(1,11) = 7.70, p = 0.018; value × memory interaction: F(1,11) = 14.34, p = 0.003, significant paired comparison: t(11) = 3.94, p = 0.001, one-tailed]. Mean and standard error of individual β coefficients against implicit baseline (percent signal change units). Memory ROIs in the MTL, indicated in sagittal section (top, x = 21), were defined by recognized versus forgotten contrasts irrespective of reward value (left, contrast maps displayed at p < 0.005). (5) Left anterior HPC (L HPC) and (6) right anterior HPC (R HPC), showing a Cue memory effect; (7) right entorhinal cortex (R Ento) showing a main memory effect; (8) left posterior parahippocampal cortex (L pPHC) showing a Stimulus memory effect. Asterisks without brackets denote significance of paired comparisons between recognized versus forgotten (green versus gray bars) scenes at the ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.005 levels; brackets denote main effects. In the L HPC and R HPC, activation was significantly greater during the Cue interval for recognized versus forgotten high-value scenes, and in the L HPC, activation during the Stimulus interval also showed a memory effect. In the R Ento, activation was related to memory but unrelated to reward value, in both intervals. In the L pPHC, Cue interval activation was greater on high- versus low-value trials but did not predict memory formation, but Stimulus-interval activation was greater for recognized versus forgotten scenes in the low-value condition. Data for (9) contralateral R pPHC (data not shown) were similar. Error bars indicate standard error. The right entorhinal cortex showed greater activation for all subsequently recognized scenes during both Cue and Stimulus intervals [memory main effect, Cue interval: F(1,11) = 11.55, p = 0.006; Stimulus interval: F(1,11) = 13.65, p = 0.004; no interactions]. Left pPHC activation during the Cue interval was not greater for remembered as opposed to forgotten items, but was greater for high- versus low-value scenes [value main effect: F(1,11) = 8.43, p = 0.01]. Left pPHC Stimulus-interval activation was greater for remembered versus forgotten trials only for low-value scenes [memory main effect: F(1,11) = 16.51, p = 0.002, value × memory interaction: F(1,11) = 7.33, p = 0.02; significant paired comparison: t(11) = 4.60, p = 0.0004, one-tailed]. Right pPHC ([27, −45, −5], not plotted), showed a similar pattern of activation [value main effect, Cue interval: F(1,11) = 5.93, p = 0.03; memory main effect, Stimulus interval: F(1,11) = 6.42, p = 0.03; value × memory interaction, Stimulus interval: F(1,11) = 6.62, p = 0.03; significant paired comparison: t(11) = 3.54, p = 0.002, one-tailed]. High versus low reward value activated one additional MTL region. Perirhinal/entorhinal cortex (abutting the collateral sulcus [31, −22, −18], data not shown) was activated by high- versus low-value reward but uncorrelated with memory formation [value main effect, Cue interval: F(1,11) = 32.17, p = 0.001; Stimulus interval: F(1,11) = 4.03, p = 0.07]. Regional specificity of value and memory effects was confirmed in the four right MTL ROIs via three-way ANOVA interactions within each interval (significant region × value × memory interaction, Cue interval: F(3,9) = 37.33, p = 0.00002; Stimulus: F(3,9) = 2.7, p = 0.11), and in a four-way ANOVA interaction (region × interval × value × memory, F(3,9) = 5.27, p = 0.02). The two left MTL ROIs (HPC and pPHC) showed regional specificity within the Cue interval (significant region × memory interaction, Cue interval: F(1,11) = 8.7, p = 0.01; Stimulus: n.s.; region × value × memory trend, Cue interval: F(1,11) = 4.09, p = 0.07; Stimulus: n.s., no region × interval × value × memory interaction). To explore activation correlations between regions, we generated within-subject parametric maps of correlations with seed ROIs in the right and left VTA, hypothesized to be the source of anticipatory activations in the hippocampus. These connectivity analyses reveal regions that vary together trial to trial, thus complementing the group analyses, which identify regions where the magnitude of activation is relatively consistent across trials within a condition. We calculated correlations across trials within a condition, contrasted the correlations in different conditions, and averaged the Z scores from these individual contrasts to obtain group maps.

Discrete tunnel junctions, or molecular diodes, have been reported using scanning probes11,12, break junctions13,14, metallic crossbars6 and nanopores8,15. For technological applications, molecular tunnel junctions must be reliable, stable and reproducible. The conductance per molecule, however, typically varies by many orders of magnitude5. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) may offer a promising route to the fabrication of reliable devices, and charge transport through SAMs of alkanethiols within nanopores is well understood, with non-resonant tunnelling dominating the transport mechanism8. Unfortunately, electrical shorts in SAMs are often formed upon vapour deposition of the top electrode16,17,18, which limits the diameter of the nanopore diodes to about 45 nm. Here we demonstrate a method to manufacture molecular junctions with diameters up to 100 µm with high yields (> 95 per cent). The junctions show excellent stability and reproducibility, and the conductance per unit area is similar to that obtained for benchmark nanopore diodes. Our technique involves processing the molecular junctions in the holes of a lithographically patterned photoresist, and then inserting a conducting polymer interlayer between the SAM and the metal top electrode. This simple approach is potentially low-cost and could pave the way for practical molecular electronics."
https://openalex.org/W2135090757,"Long-term depression (LTD) of the synapse formed between cortical pyramidal neurons and striatal medium spiny neurons is central to many theories of motor plasticity and associative learning. The induction of LTD at this synapse is thought to depend upon D2 dopamine receptors localized in the postsynaptic membrane. If this were true, LTD should be inducible in neurons from only one of the two projection systems of the striatum. Using transgenic mice in which neurons that contribute to these two systems are labeled, we show that this is not the case. Rather, in both cell types, the D2 receptor dependence of LTD induction reflects the need to lower M1 muscarinic receptor activity—a goal accomplished by D2 receptors on cholinergic interneurons. In addition to reconciling discordant tracts of the striatal literature, these findings point to cholinergic interneurons as key mediators of dopamine-dependent striatal plasticity and learning.

In addition to reconciling discordant tracts of the striatal literature, these findings point to cholinergic interneurons as key mediators of dopamine-dependent striatal plasticity and learning. The striatum is a hub in forebrain circuits subserving both motor and cognitive functions. The principal neurons of the striatum—medium spiny neurons—integrate synaptic information from functionally diverse cortical regions, transforming it into signals that control goal-directed behaviors and habits (Graybiel et al., 1994Graybiel A.M.

Alterations in the strength of the synaptic connections between the cortex and striatum are generally thought to underlie adaptive changes in these behaviors. The best-characterized plasticity at this synapse is long-term depression (LTD) (Centonze et al., 2001Centonze D. Picconi B. Gubellini P. Bernardi G. Calabresi P.

The induction of corticostriatal LTD is dependent upon dopamine, which is released in response to reward or reward-associated stimuli (Schultz, 2005Schultz W. Behavioral theories and the neurophysiology of reward.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2005; 57: 87-115Crossref Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Both molecular and pharmacological studies have provided compelling evidence that dopamine controls LTD induction by activating D2 dopamine receptors (Calabresi et al., 1992Calabresi P. Maj R.

These receptors are positioned near glutamatergic synapses, in the membrane of medium spiny neurons (Delle Donne et al., 1997Delle Donne K.T. Sesack S.R. Pickel V.M. Ultrastructural immunocytochemical localization of the dopamine D2 receptor within GABAergic neurons of the rat striatum.Brain Res. 1997; 746: 239-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). But, this widely held model poses a conceptual problem. Medium spiny neurons are heterogeneous, forming two large, equally sized, efferent streams that differ in their axonal targets and, more importantly, in their expression of dopamine receptors (Gerfen, 1992Gerfen C.R. The neostriatal mosaic: multiple levels of compartmental organization in the basal ganglia.Annu. Rev.

Coordinated expression of dopamine receptors in neostriatal medium spiny neurons.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6579-6591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurons in only one of these groups—the striatopallidal neurons—express D2 receptors. Is it possible that LTD is only expressed in striatopallidal medium spiny neurons and not in neighboring striatonigral neurons that rely upon D1 dopamine receptors to signal dopamine release? Given the high percentage of neurons exhibiting LTD (Calabresi et al., 1994Calabresi P. Pisani A. Mercuri N.B. Bernardi G. Post-receptor mechanisms underlying striatal long-term depression.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4871-4881PubMed Google Scholar, Choi and Lovinger, 1997Choi S. Lovinger D.M.

USA. 1997; 94: 2665-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and the centrality of LTD to theories of network plasticity, this seems highly unlikely. Although engagement of D2 receptors in LTD induction is clear, the location of the receptors involved is less securely fixed by experiment. Is it possible that the D2 receptors involved are not located in medium spiny neurons, but rather in one of the interneuronal populations in the striatum? This interneuron would have to express D2 dopamine receptors and modulate synaptic transmission in all medium spiny neurons. One interneuron fulfills these requirements: the giant striatal cholinergic interneuron. These cells express high levels of D2 receptor protein whose activation slows autonomous pacemaking and reduces acetylcholine (ACh) release (DeBoer et al., 1996DeBoer P. Heeringa M.J.

One of the major targets of M1 receptor modulation in medium spiny neurons is the L-type Ca2+ channel. These channels also are positioned at the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic synapses (Day et al., 2006Day M. Wang Z. Ding J. An X. Ingham C.A. Shering A.F. Wokosin D. Ilijic E. Sun Z.

Post-receptor mechanisms underlying striatal long-term depression.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4871-4881PubMed Google Scholar, Choi and Lovinger, 1997Choi S. Lovinger D.M.

Dopamine modulation of state-dependent endocannabinoid release and long-term depression in the striatum.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10537-10545Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). M1 receptor activation reduces the opening of these channels in response to depolarization—forging a potential antagonist link between the mechanisms underlying LTD induction and ACh. Could the D2 receptor dependence of LTD induction reflect the need to pause cholinergic interneuron spiking and reduce M1 receptor tone at corticostriatal synapses? The experiments reported here provide support for this hypothesis. Using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice in which D1 and D2 receptor-expressing neurons are labeled with EGFP (Heintz, 2001Heintz N. BAC to the future: the use of bac transgenic mice for neuroscience research.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), we show that the corticostriatal synapses in both cell types are subject to D2 receptor-dependent LTD with similar features. More importantly, LTD at these synapses can be rescued following D2 receptor blockade by lowering M1 receptor tone. These results strongly suggest that the dopaminergic control of LTD induction at these synapses is not direct, but mediated by cholinergic interneurons. The first step toward understanding the cellular basis for the D2 receptor dependence of LTD induction was to put in place a preparation that allowed D1 and D2 receptor-expressing neurons to be readily distinguished—allowing a direct test of the hypothesis that postsynaptic D2 receptors were necessary for LTD induction. To this end, BAC transgenic mice in which cellular EGFP expression was driven by a D1 receptor promoter construct (BAC D1-EGFP) or by a D2 receptor promoter construct (BAC D2-EGFP) were obtained from GENSAT (Heintz, 2001Heintz N. BAC to the future: the use of bac transgenic mice for neuroscience research.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In striatal tissue slices from either animal, roughly half of the medium spiny neurons were labeled (Figures 1A and 1B). To verify that the labeling was specific, single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (scRT-PCR) profiling was performed for mRNAs associated with each cell type. As expected, EGFP-labeled medium-sized neurons from BAC D1-EGFP mice expressed substance P (SP) and D1 receptor mRNA, but not enkephalin (ENK) or D2 receptor mRNAs (Figure 1C, n = 9). Conversely, labeled striatal neurons from BAC D2-EGFP mice had detectable levels of ENK and D2 receptor mRNA, but not SP or D1 receptor mRNAs (Figure 1D, n = 10). Although previous work has shown that a small percentage of medium spiny neurons in young rats coexpressed D1 and D2 receptor mRNAs (Surmeier et al., 1996Surmeier D.J. Song W.J. Yan Z. Coordinated expression of dopamine receptors in neostriatal medium spiny neurons.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6579-6591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), no coexpression was detected in EGFP-labeled neurons from 3- to 4-week-old mice. Other members of the D2 receptor class (D3, D4) that colocalize with D1 receptors in medium spiny neurons were not examined, because previous work has shown that LTD induction is controlled exclusively by D2 receptors (Calabresi et al., 1997Calabresi P. Saiardi A. Pisani A. Baik J.H. Centonze D. Mercuri N.B. Bernardi G. Borrelli E. Abnormal synaptic plasticity in the striatum of mice lacking dopamine D2 receptors.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4536-4544PubMed Google Scholar). In both mouse lines, labeled medium-sized neurons had anatomical (Figures 1E and 1F) and electrophysiological properties that were typical of medium spiny neurons (Figures 1G and 1H; n = 5) (Kawaguchi et al., 1989Kawaguchi Y. Wilson C.J. Emson P.C. Intracellular recording of identified neostriatal patch and matrix spiny cells in a slice preparation preserving cortical inputs.J. Neurophysiol. 1989; 62: 1052-1068PubMed Google Scholar). The best-characterized form of corticostriatal LTD in medium spiny neurons is induced by pairing high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of glutamatergic afferent fibers and postsynaptic depolarization (Choi and Lovinger, 1997Choi S. Lovinger D.M. Decreased probability of neurotransmitter release underlies striatal long-term depression and postnatal development of corticostriatal synapses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 2665-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This form of LTD is not dependent upon NMDA receptors. In the presence of the NMDA receptor antagonist AP-5 (50 μM) and the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (10 μM), stimulation of the cortex or underlying white matter generated an EPSC in medium spiny neurons that was blocked by AMPA receptor antagonists (CNQX, 10 μM, n = 5 or NBQX, 5 μM, n = 5) (Figure 2A), demonstrating the engagement of glutamatergic corticostriatal axons. Pairing HFS stimulation of the cerebral cortex overlying the striatum (Figure 2A) or the white matter of the corpus callosum with postsynaptic depolarization of D2 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons from BAC mice led to the induction of a robust LTD (Figure 2B, n = 5; see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available online). The LTD was similar in magnitude and kinetics to that seen in other published reports (e.g., Calabresi et al., 1992Calabresi P. Maj R. Pisani A. Mercuri N.B. Bernardi G. Long-term synaptic depression in the striatum: physiological and pharmacological characterization.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4224-4233PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction in EPSC amplitude following LTD induction also was accompanied by an elevation in the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) (control PPR = 1.06 ± 0.07, post PPR = 1.29 ± 0.05, n = 6; p < 0.05 Kruskal-Wallis), suggesting a reduction in glutamate release probability (Choi and Lovinger, 1997Choi S. Lovinger D.M. Decreased probability of neurotransmitter release underlies striatal long-term depression and postnatal development of corticostriatal synapses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 2665-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Moreover, the induction failed in the presence of the D2 receptor antagonist (−) sulpiride (10 μM, Figure 2C, n = 8) (Calabresi et al., 1992Calabresi P. Maj R. Pisani A. Mercuri N.B. Bernardi G. Long-term synaptic depression in the striatum: physiological and pharmacological characterization.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4224-4233PubMed Google Scholar). This result was obtained in two independent laboratories (data in Figure 2 is from the Surmeier lab; data in Figure S1 is from the Lovinger lab, n = 6). Because ambient extracellular levels of dopamine in slices appear to be very low (Bamford et al., 2004Bamford N.S. Zhang H. Schmitz Y. Wu N.P. Cepeda C. Levine M.S. Schmauss C. Zakharenko S.S.

Benoit-Marand M. Gonon F. Sulzer D. Presynaptic regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission.J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 273-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), it is our working assumption that the dopamine required for LTD induction is being released during HFS either by glutamate or by direct activation of dopaminergic fibers (David et al., 2005David H.N. Ansseau M. Abraini J.H. Dopamine-glutamate reciprocal modulation of release and motor responses in the rat caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens of “intact” animals.Brain Res. Brain Res.

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors interact with dopamine in induction of striatal long-term depression.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2541-2549PubMed Google Scholar). In brain slices from BAC D2 mice, pairing HFS and depolarization (HFS/DP) also induced a robust LTD in neighboring unlabeled (presumably D1 receptor expressing) medium spiny neurons (Figure S1, n = 6). LTD induction in these cells also was accompanied by an elevation in PPR (Figure S1, n = 6). To provide a definitive test of whether LTD could be induced in D1 receptor-expressing, striatonigral neurons, the BAC D1-EGFP mice were used. In these medium spiny neurons, pairing HFS and depolarization also induced a robust LTD that was similar in kinetics and magnitude to that seen in striatopallidal neurons; LTD also was accompanied by an elevation in the PPR (control PPR = 0.97 ± 0.05, post-PPR = 1.32 ± 0.14, n = 7; p < 0.05 Kruskal-Wallis) (Figure 2D). As in the D2 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons, LTD induction in D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons was blocked by preincubation with a D2 receptor antagonist (Figure 2E, n = 8). LTD induced by cortical HFS/DP in medium spiny neurons is dependent upon postsynaptic generation of endocannabinoids and activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors (Gerdeman et al., 2002Gerdeman G.L. Ronesi J. Lovinger D.M. Postsynaptic endocannabinoid release is critical to long-term depression in the striatum.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 446-451PubMed Google Scholar, Kreitzer and Malenka, 2005Kreitzer A.C. Malenka R.C. Dopamine modulation of state-dependent endocannabinoid release and long-term depression in the striatum.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10537-10545Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In our hands, LTD induction was blocked by the CB1 receptor antagonist AM 251 (2 μM) in both D2 (n = 7) and D1 receptor (n = 7) expressing neurons (Figure S2). The ability of D2 receptor antagonists to block LTD induction in medium spiny neurons that do not express D2 receptors suggests that receptors on another neuron are controlling induction. One way of narrowing the range of possibilities is to identify an LTD control element that is shared by both classes of medium spiny neuron. As noted above, previous work has suggested that L-type Ca2+ channels are necessary for LTD induction (Calabresi et al., 1994Calabresi P. Pisani A. Mercuri N.B. Bernardi G. Post-receptor mechanisms underlying striatal long-term depression.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4871-4881PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a subtype of L-type channel—Cav1.3 channels—was localized to spines and postsynaptic glutamatergic synapses in both classes of medium spiny neuron (Day et al., 2006Day M. Wang Z. Ding J. An X. Ingham C.A. Shering A.F. Wokosin D. Ilijic E. Sun Z. Sampson A.R. et al.Selective elimination of glutamatergic synapses on striatopallidal neurons in Parkinson disease models.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, Olson et al., 2005Olson P.A. Tkatch T. Hernandez-Lopez S. Ulrich S. Ilijic E. Mugnaini E. Zhang H. Bezprozvanny I. Surmeier D.J.

Thus, these channels are appropriately positioned to regulate glutamatergic synaptic plasticity. To test for the specific involvement of Cav1.3 channels in LTD induction, two experiments were performed. First, the susceptibility of LTD to blockade of the L-type channel antagonist nimodipine was examined. Medium spiny neurons coexpress two L-type channels: one having a Cav1.2 pore-forming subunit, the other having a Cav1.3 subunit (Olson et al., 2005Olson P.A. Tkatch T. Hernandez-Lopez S. Ulrich S. Ilijic E. Mugnaini E. Zhang H. Bezprozvanny I. Surmeier D.J. G-protein-coupled receptor modulation of striatal CaV1.3 L-type Ca2+ channels is dependent on a Shank-binding domain.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1050-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These channels differ in the potency with which they are blocked by nimodipine. The IC50 for nimodipine block of Cav1.2 L-type channels is near 200 nM, whereas the potency of nimodipine at Cav1.3 channels is roughly 10-fold lower (Xu and Lipscombe, 2001Xu W. Lipscombe D. Neuronal Ca(V)1.3alpha(1) L-type channels activate at relatively hyperpolarized membrane potentials and are incompletely inhibited by dihydropyridines.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5944-5951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A concentration of nimodipine (2 μM) that should produce a near complete block of Cav1.2 channels and a 50% block of Cav1.3 channels did not block LTD induction (Figure 3A, n = 9). However, elevating the nimodipine concentration (10 μM) to produce a more complete block of Cav1.3 channels abolished LTD (Figure 3B, n = 9). Although there was no obvious heterogeneity in the response to nimodipine, BAC D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons were tested for their sensitivity to L-type channel blockade. In both cell types (BAC D1, n = 3; BAC D2, n = 4), nimodipine (10 μM) prevented LTD induction (Figure S3). Next, LTD was examined in Cav1.3−/− mice. Pairing of HFS and depolarization failed to induce any significant change in EPSC amplitude in any of these neurons (Figure 3B, n = 9). These data suggest that Cav1.3, but not Cav1.2, channels are necessary for LTD induction in both striatonigral and striatopallidal medium spiny neurons. Previous work by our group has shown that Cav1.3 channels in medium spiny neurons are potently modulated by M1 muscarinic receptors (Howe and Surmeier, 1995Howe A.R. Surmeier D.J.

M1 muscarinic receptors are robustly expressed by both D1 receptor-expressing striatonigral and D2 receptor-expressing striatopallidal neurons (Bernard et al., 1992Bernard V. Normand E. Bloch B. Phenotypical characterization of the rat striatal neurons expressing muscarinic receptor genes.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3591-3600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Hersch et al., 1994Hersch S.M.

Coordinated expression of muscarinic receptor messenger RNAs in striatal medium spiny neurons.Neuroscience. 2001; 103: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because cholinergic interneurons are autonomously active (Bennett and Wilson, 1999Bennett B.D. Wilson C.J. Spontaneous activity of neostriatal cholinergic interneurons in vitro.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5586-5596PubMed Google Scholar), there should be a significant level of basal ACh release and M1 receptor activity in striatal slices. To determine whether this ambient receptor stimulation had any impact on excitatory synaptic transmission, the M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (1–10 μM) was bath applied. Blockade of M1 receptors reversibly reduced EPSC amplitude (Figure 4A, n = 7). Another way of reducing ambient M1 receptor tone is to promote degradation of ACh by elevating the extracellular concentration of ACh esterase (AChE). Bath application of AChE (2 U/ml) also reversibly reduced EPSC amplitude (Figure 4B, n = 6). Postsynaptic M1 receptors might modulate synaptic transmission by reducing Cav1.3 channel opening in response to synaptic stimulation. Ca2+ entry through these channels is thought to control activity-dependent generation of endocannabinoids and CB1 receptor-dependent presynaptic inhibition (Gerdeman et al., 2002Gerdeman G.L. Ronesi J. Lovinger D.M. Postsynaptic endocannabinoid release is critical to long-term depression in the striatum.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 446-451PubMed Google Scholar, Kreitzer and Malenka, 2005Kreitzer A.C. Malenka R.C. Dopamine modulation of state-dependent endocannabinoid release and long-term depression in the striatum.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10537-10545Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, pirenzepine had no effect on synaptic transmission in medium spiny neurons from Cav1.3 channel−/− mice (Figure S4, n = 5). This loss was not a consequence of an adaptation to deletion of Cav1.3 subunits, as the application of nimodipine (10 μM) to wild-type medium spiny neurons either before or after pirenzepine also abolished the modulation of synaptic transmission (Figure S4, n = 5, 3). Since these channels are gated by membrane potential, postsynaptic depolarization produced by activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors should be necessary for the effect of M1 receptor antagonism to be expressed. To test this conjecture, pirenzepine was applied and afferent stimulation stopped. As predicted, when stimulation was resumed, EPSC amplitude was at the control level, falling only with subsequent afferent activation (Figure 4C, n = 5). Presumably, afferent stimulation was necessary because it led to postsynaptic depolarization and activation of Cav1.3 channels—in spite of the somatic membrane being clamped at −70 mV. This isn't surprising, particularly if the channels are localized on spine heads where glutamatergic synaptic input is likely to produce a large transient depolarization (Carter and Sabatini, 2004Carter A.G. Sabatini B.L. State-dependent calcium signaling in dendritic spines of striatal medium spiny neurons.Neuron. 2004; 44: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Although spine heads cannot be clamped, somatic hyperpolarization should reduce the magnitude of the depolarization achieved during synaptic stimulation, decreasing the chances of Cav1.3 channel opening. To test this conjecture, the somatic membrane potential was held at −90 mV (rather than −70 mV) during application of pirenzepine and afferent stimulation. In this situation, pirenzepine failed to alter EPSC amplitude; subsequent movement of the somatic membrane potential into a more depolarized, permissive range allowed expression of the modulation (Figure 4D, n = 5). Finally, the effect of pirenzepine was associative—requiring both pre- and postsynaptic activity, as postsynaptic depolarization alone was not sufficient to enable the pirenzepine effect on synaptic transmission (data not shown, n = 3). As mentioned above, the best characterized linkage between Cav1.3 channel opening and synaptic transmission is through endocannabinoids. The production of endocannabinoids is stimulated by elevation of cytosolic Ca2+, subsequent to channel opening. As expected of such a mechanism, intracellular dialysis with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA blocked"

Our data challenge a central feature of the current mammalian circadian clock model regarding the necessity of CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers for clock function. Endogenous circadian clocks drive daily rhythms of physiology and behavior in most organisms. In mammals, circadian clocks operate in nearly all cells and tissues and are organized hierarchically (Reppert and Weaver, 2002Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Coordination of circadian timing in mammals.Nature. 2002; 418: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (3132) Google Scholar, Lowrey and Takahashi, 2004Lowrey P.L. Takahashi J.S. Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization.Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2004; 5: 407-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). At the top of this hierarchy is a master clock that resides within the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus. The SCN clock is entrained to the 24 hr period by the daily light-dark cycle acting through retina to SCN pathways, and, in turn, the entrained SCN synchronizes the phase of circadian oscillators in peripheral tissues. Peripheral oscillators drive the rhythmic expression of genes involved in the physiological processes carried out by that tissue (see Duffield, 2003Duffield G.E.

The intracellular molecular mechanism underlying the mammalian clockwork has been most extensively studied in the mouse, where interlocking transcriptional feedback loops drive the self-sustaining clock mechanism in both the SCN and peripheral tissues (Shearman et al., 2000Shearman L.P.

Coordination of circadian timing in mammals.Nature. 2002; 418: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (3132) Google Scholar). At the core of the molecular clock lies a pair of PAS-containing bHLH transcription factors, CLOCK and BMAL1. CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers drive the rhythmic expression of three Period genes (mPer1–mPer3) and two Cryptochrome genes (mCry1 and mCry2) through E box enhancer elements. The resultant proteins form PER/CRY complexes that translocate back into the nucleus to inhibit CLOCK:BMAL1-mediated transcription, completing the negative transcriptional feedback loop essential for clockwork function. Posttranslational processes appear to contribute to the time delays in the feedback mechanism needed for a 24 hr clock (Lowrey et al., 2000Lowrey P.L. Shimomura Z. Antoch M.P. Yamazaki S.

An interlocking positive transcriptional feedback loop involves CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers indirectly regulating a rhythm in Bmal1 transcription; the nuclear orphan receptor genes Rev-erbα and Rora are coordinately activated by CLOCK:BMAL1 to produce proteins that compete for the same promoter element, but have opposing actions, on Bmal1 transcription (Preitner et al., 2002Preitner N.

Because of the hierarchical nature of the mammalian circadian timing system, we have begun to address circadian function in individual tissues by using the Cre-LoxP recombination system (Nagy, 2000Nagy A.

Psychiatry. 2003; 54: 1125-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) to disrupt clock function in a tissue-specific manner. We chose to target the Clock gene because all available genetic, molecular, and biochemical data to date suggest that it is a critical component of the circadian clockwork (Lowrey and Takahashi, 2004Lowrey P.L.

Furthermore, mice homozygous for a null allele of Bmal1 have disrupted behavioral and molecular rhythms (Bunger et al., 2000Bunger M.K. Wilsbacher L.D. Moran S.M. Clendinin C. Radcliffe L.A. Hogenesch J.B. Simon M.C. Takahashi J.S. Bradfield C.A. Mop3 is an essential component of the master circadian pacemaker in mammals.Cell. 2000; 103: 1009-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). In the present report, we used the Cre-LoxP system to disrupt the Clock gene and analyzed the behavioral and molecular rhythms in these null mutant mice. To our surprise, CLOCK-deficient mice continue to express robust circadian rhythms in locomotor activity, but they do have altered responses to light. At the molecular and biochemical levels, clock gene mRNA and protein levels in both the SCN and liver show several alterations in the null mutant animals, but the molecular clock continues to run. Our data indicate that a central tenet of the mammalian circadian clock model, the necessity of CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers for clockwork function, needs to be reassessed. To generate mice carrying an allele of Clock that can be conditionally disrupted, we used a “knockin” gene targeting approach to introduce LoxP sites into the introns flanking exons 5 and 6; these exons encode the bHLH domain, which appears to be required for CLOCK interaction with BMAL1 (Rutter et al., 2001Rutter J. Reick M. Wu L.C. McKnight S.L. Regulation of CLOCK and NPAS2 DNA binding by the redox state of NAD cofactors.Science. 2001; 293: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), as well as its nuclear translocation (Kondratov et al., 2003Kondratov R.V. Chernov M.V. Kondratova A.A. Gorbacheva V.Y. Gudkov A.V. Antoch M.P. BMAL1-dependent circadian oscillation of nuclear CLOCK: posttranslational events induced by the dimerization of the transcriptional activators of the mammalian clock system.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1921-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The 15 kb targeting construct (Figure 1A) carried two selectable markers, neomycin (Neo) resistance and thymidine kinase (TK), flanked by LoxP sites between exons 4 and 5, and an additional LoxP site between exons 6 and 7. ES cells were transfected with this targeting construct, and 22 of 384 neomycin-resistant clones had probable homologous integration as determined by restriction digest and Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Two of the ES clones were subsequently transfected with Cre recombinase (Cre) to remove the Neo-TK markers, and subclones were selected for the absence of TK using gancyclovir. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to screen for subclones in which recombination led to excision of the floxed Neo-TK cassette and retention of exons 5–6 flanked on each side by a single LoxP site (Figure 1A; Clockflox allele). Two of these subclones, confirmed to contain the floxed allele by Southern blot analysis and long-range genomic PCR, were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts. Twenty-seven chimeric mice were recovered and bred with C57BL/6J mice. One of the ∼600 pups born received the Clockflox allele. This mouse served as the founder to establish a line of Clockflox mice. Because a Clock null mutation has not been previously reported, we crossed the Clockflox line to a transgenic line expressing Cre under the control of the Protamine1 promoter (PRM1-Cre; O'Gorman et al., 1997O'Gorman S. Dagenais N.A. Qian M. Marchuk Y. Protamine-Cre recombinase transgenes efficiently recombine target sequence in the male germ line of mice, but not in embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 14602-14607Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A, ClockΔ5-6 allele). In PRM1-Cre mice, Cre is expressed in the testis, inducing a recombination between LoxP sites in male germ cells; thus exons 5 and 6 were deleted during spermatogenesis, and the recombined ClockΔ5-6 allele was passed to the offspring from the male parent. Heterozygous whole-animal Clock deletion mutant mice (Clock+/Δ5-6) were identified and crossed. Heterozygote intercrosses produced progeny of each genotype (Figure 1B) in the expected 1:2:1 ratios (26.0% wild-type, 48.7% heterozygous, 25.3% homozygous; n = 454 offspring), indicating that animals homozygous for this deletion mutation are viable. Homozygous ClockΔ5-6/Δ5-6 mutant mice had no gross anatomical abnormalities. We used previously characterized antibodies generated against the C-terminal portion of the CLOCK protein (Lee et al., 2001Lee C. Etchegaray J.P. Cagampang F.R. Loudon A.S. Reppert S.M. Posttranslational mechanisms regulate the mammalian circadian clock.Cell. 2001; 107: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) to determine whether the deletion of exons 5 and 6 of Clock allowed production of a protein product. Using an antibody generated in guinea pigs (gp), prominent nuclear immunostaining was detected in the SCN of wild-type mice, and nuclear immunostaining was absent in the homozygous ClockΔ5-6/Δ5-6 mutant mice (Figure 2A, left). Diffuse staining was also observed in a population of glial-like cells in both wild-type mice and homozygous ClockΔ5-6/Δ5-6 mutant mice (Figure 2A, left). Using an antibody to the same epitope of CLOCK generated in rats, however, only nuclear staining was observed in wild-type mice, and this staining was absent in the SCN of ClockΔ5-6/Δ5-6 mutant mice (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available online). This indicates that the glial-like staining seen with CLOCK-gp was nonspecific and does not represent CLOCK protein. We conclude that the deletion mutation is indeed a null; homozygous ClockΔ5-6/Δ5-6 mutant mice are therefore subsequently referred to as Clock−/− or CLOCK-deficient mice. BMAL1 immunoreactivity in the SCN of the Clock−/− mice was reduced by >90% (Figure 2A, right). Immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments of whole-brain lysates (Figure 2B) and liver nuclear extracts (Figure 2C) confirmed that the remaining immunoreactivity in Clock−/− mice was nonspecific. The anti-CLOCK antibody precipitated CLOCK from wild-type mice, but failed to purify any protein in Clock−/− animals. Similarly, immunoprecipitation with anti-BMAL1 antibody failed to purify CLOCK in Clock−/− mice, but it did purify BMAL1 in both the wild-type and Clock−/− mice (Figure 2C, and data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the deletion of exons 5 and 6 of Clock results in a null allele, and mice homozygous for this allele are CLOCK deficient. To determine the effect of CLOCK deficiency on behavioral rhythmicity, we monitored wheel-running activity under constant darkness (DD) for 4 weeks, following an initial 14 days in a 12 hr light/12 hr dark (LD) cycle. Consistent with a previous report that monitored behavioral rhythms in a strain heterozygous for a chromosomal deletion containing the Clock gene (King et al., 1997aKing D.P. Vitaterna M.H. Chang A.-M. Dove W.F. Pinto L.H. Turek F.W. Takahashi J.S. The mouse Clock mutation behaves as an antimorph and maps within the W19H deletion, distal of kit.Genetics. 1997; 146: 1049-1060PubMed Google Scholar), heterozygous Clock null mutant mice (+/−) displayed normal circadian patterns of behavior, with periods of 23.5 ± 0.2 hr (mean ± SEM; n = 8), similar to those of wild-type animals (+/+; 23.6 ± 0.1 hr; n = 17) (Figures 3A and 3B). CLOCK-deficient mice (−/−) maintained robust circadian patterns of behavior, with periodicities that were on average ∼20 min shorter (23.2 ± 0.1 hr; n = 17) than their wild-type siblings (Figures 3A and 3B). All of the CLOCK-deficient mice tested displayed strong behavioral rhythmicity throughout the 4 weeks in DD, comparable to that of their wild-type siblings (Figures 3A and 3C), despite a slight reduction in their activity levels (Figure 3D). Thus, CLOCK is not required for the generation of robust circadian rhythms in locomotor activity. When maintained on the LD cycle, mouse locomotor activity is typically restricted to the night via daily light-induced resetting of the underlying circadian pacemaker to maintain synchrony of the clock to the 24 hr day (termed “entrainment”). During the initial period of behavioral monitoring in LD, wild-type and heterozygous animals showed normally entrained daily patterns of activity, initiating their nightly bouts of activity at the beginning of the dark period (Figure 3A; data not shown). However, we noticed that most CLOCK-deficient animals became active ∼2 hr before lights-off (Figure 3A), suggesting that they may have altered resetting responses to light. Alternatively, this advanced activity could be due to a deficit in the “masking” effect of light and not altered entrainment, as masking alterations have been shown in BMAL1-deficient (Bunger et al., 2000Bunger M.K.

Hattar S. Mrosovsky N. The circadian Clock mutant mouse: impaired masking response to light.J. Comp. Physiol. [A]. 2005; 191: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that upon re-entrainment to LD (see below), CLOCK-deficient mice initiated their activity coincident with lights-off, as observed in the other genotypes. To examine resetting responses to light, wild-type, heterozygous, and CLOCK-deficient mice were exposed to LD for several weeks and then were exposed to a 4 hr extension of the light period, followed by constant darkness (Figure 4A). Exposure to light during this period of the night (zeitgeber time [ZT] 12–16) was expected to cause a phase delay in the activity rhythm (see Dunlap, 1999Dunlap J.C. Molecular bases for circadian clocks.Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar). Wild-type and heterozygous mutant mice responded as expected, with average (±SEM) delays of 1.6 ± 0.1 and 1.9 ± 0.5 hr, respectively. In contrast, the activity rhythm of CLOCK-deficient mice was not delayed by the 4 hr light extension (Figure 4A). To rule out the possibility that the apparent phase shifts after light exposure were due to an abnormal phase of entrainment, the phase of rhythmicity after release of the same animals directly into DD was assessed. Comparison of the phase of rhythmicity after release into DD with that after the light extension revealed that the phase shifts in the wild-type and heterozygous mice were statistically significant (paired t tests, p < 0.05), while those in the CLOCK-deficient mice were not (Figure 4A; p = 0.7). The animals were subsequently re-entrained to LD12:12 for 3 weeks and were then exposed to a light stimulus expected to elicit a phase advance of the activity rhythm (see Dunlap, 1999Dunlap J.C. Molecular bases for circadian clocks.Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar). Specifically, following the last normal lighting cycle, animals were exposed to a single, 4 hr light pulse late in the night (at ZT 20–24), and then were released into constant darkness (see Figure 4B). Wild-type and heterozygous mutant mice responded with phase advances of 1.8 ± 0.5 and 2.0 ± 0.6 hr, respectively (Figure 4B). These phase advances were significantly greater than when the same animals were placed into DD without the light pulse (p < 0.01, paired t tests), indicating that the phase advances were light induced. Light-induced advances of the activity rhythm in CLOCK-deficient mice averaged 6.8 ± 0.9 hr, more than three times larger than those occurring in their wild-type and heterozygous siblings. These large phase advances in CLOCK-deficient mice are similar to those observed in REV-ERBα-deficient mice (Preitner et al., 2002Preitner N. Damiola F. Lopez-Molina L. Zakany J. Duboule D. Albrecht U. Schibler U. The orphan nuclear receptor REV-ERBα controls circadian transcription within the positive limb of the mammalian circadian oscillator.Cell. 2002; 110: 251-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). These results indicate that CLOCK-deficient mice have altered responses to light, with reduced phase delays and exaggerated phase advances in the paradigms used. CLOCK may have a role in the light input pathway or in regulating SCN responsiveness to light. One potential mechanism for enhancing the magnitude of phase shifts is through reduction of pacemaker amplitude (Winfree, 1970Winfree A.T. Integrated view of resetting a circadian clock.J. Theor. Biol. 1970; 28: 327-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), but this would not explain the failure of CLOCK-deficient mice to phase delay. Since CLOCK-deficient mice exhibit nearly normal circadian patterns of locomotor behavior, we predicted that the molecular oscillator driving circadian gene expression patterns in the master pacemaker in the SCN would not be dramatically affected in these mice. To test this prediction, brains were collected from wild-type and CLOCK-deficient mice at 4 hr intervals across the circadian cycle during the first day in DD and processed for in situ hybridization to determine the expression levels of the core clock genes mPer1, mPer2, Rev-erbα, and Bmal1 (Figure 5A) and the clock-controlled genes (CCGs) Pk2, Avp, and Dbp (Figure 5B) in the SCN. We chose to examine these particular genes because, with the exception of Bmal1, all are putative direct targets of CLOCK:BMAL1-mediated transcription through E box enhancer elements (Gekakis et al., 1998Gekakis N.

This study explored the idea that reconsolidation occurs in spatial memory when animals retrieve memory under circumstances in which new memory encoding is likely to occur. Control studies confirmed that intrahippocampal infusions of anisomycin inhibited protein synthesis locally and that the spatial training protocols we used are subject to overnight protein synthesis-dependent consolidation. We then compared the impact of anisomycin in two conditions: when memory retrieval occurred in a reference memory task after performance had reached asymptote over several days; and after a comparable extent of training of a delayed matching-to-place task in which new memory encoding was required each day. Sensitivity to intrahippocampal anisomycin was observed only in the protocol involving new memory encoding at the time of retrieval. Reconsolidation is a putative neuronal process in which the retrieval of a previously consolidated memory returns it to a labile state that is once again subject to stabilization. This study explored the idea that reconsolidation occurs in spatial memory when animals retrieve memory under circumstances in which new memory encoding is likely to occur.

Sensitivity to intrahippocampal anisomycin was observed only in the protocol involving new memory encoding at the time of retrieval. The purpose of this study was to examine the generality of the concept of memory “reconsolidation” (Misanin et al., 1968Misanin J.R. Miller R.R. Lewis D.J. Retrograde amnesia produced by electroconvulsive shock after reactivation of a consolidated memory trace.Science. 1968; 160: 554-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, Nader et al., 2000Nader K.

Sara S.J. Reconsolidation of memory after its reactivation.Behav. Brain Res. 1997; 84: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Memory consolidation refers to the progressive postacquisition stabilization of a memory item and to the temporal phase when this stabilization takes place. The classic consolidation hypothesis (Dudai and Morris, 2001Dudai Y. Morris R.G.M. To consolidate or not to consolidate: what are the questions?.in: Bolhuis J.J. Brain Perception, Memory. Advances in Cognitive Neuroscience. Oxford Univercity Press, Oxford2001: 147-162Google Scholar, McGaugh, 1966McGaugh J.L.

Experimentelle Beitrage zur Lehre von Gedachtnis.Z. Psychol. 1900; 1: 1-300Google Scholar) postulates that consolidation starts and ends just once for each item in long-term memory. In contrast, the reconsolidation hypothesis holds that items in long-term memory can re-enter a consolidation phase when reactivated. Upon reactivation, the stabilized memory item transiently destabilizes and again engages neuronal mechanisms of restabilization. Accordingly, memory reactivation becomes susceptible to amnesic agents, such as protein synthesis inhibitors. The notion of reconsolidation has been with us since the 1960s (Misanin et al., 1968Misanin J.R. Miller R.R. Lewis D.J. Retrograde amnesia produced by electroconvulsive shock after reactivation of a consolidated memory trace.Science. 1968; 160: 554-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) but has recently been revitalized by a series of experiments, triggered mostly by the studies of Nader et al., 2000Nader K. Schafe G.E. Le Doux J.E. Fear memories require protein synthesis in the amygdala for reconsolidation after retrieval.Nature. 2000; 406: 722-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar on fear conditioning in the rat. These authors reported that postretrieval infusions into the lateral amygdala of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin, a widely used consolidation blocker, disrupted the subsequent retrieval of rapidly acquired fear memory. Anisomycin in the absence of memory reactivation had no effect. The amnesic effect of postretrieval anisomycin infusion was long lasting. In additional studies from the same group, hippocampal lesions disrupted contextual fear conditioning when given 45 days after training, again providing that the memory was reactivated shortly before the lesion was made (Debiec et al., 2002Debiec J. LeDoux J.E. Nader K. Cellular and systems reconsolidation in the hippocampus.Neuron. 2002; 36: 527-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Reconsolidation has also been reported in other memory paradigms and in species ranging from molluscs and bees to humans (Dudai and Eisenberg, 2004Dudai Y. Eisenberg M. Rites of passage of the engram: reconsolidation and the lingering consolidation hypothesis.Neuron. 2004; 44: 93-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, Nader, 2003Nader K. Memory traces unbound.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 65-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, Sara, 2000bSara S.J. Strengthening the shaky trace through retrieval.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 212-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Despite the growing number of reports that support the reconsolidation hypothesis, alternative interpretations have been raised to account for the postreactivation effects of amnesic agents. One suggestion is that reconsolidation is a lingering consolidation process associated with the original training (Alberini, 2005Alberini C.M. Mechanisms of memory stabilization: are consolidation and reconsolidation similar or distinct processes?.Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 51-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, Dudai, 2004Dudai Y. The neurobiology of consolidations, or, how stable is the engram?.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2004; 55: 51-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). According to this view, consolidation may stop temporarily and then be restarted by memory reactivation, with some differences in the underlying neural mechanisms associated with training- and reactivation-associated forms of consolidation. Another possibility is that behavioral phenomena that may appear to indicate a “reconsolidation” process might actually reflect a reactivation-locked, temporary inability to access memory traces that dissipates over time (Lattal and Abel, 2004Lattal K.M. Abel T. Behavioral impairments caused by injections of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin after contextual retrieval reverse with time.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 4667-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A third possibility is that apparent amnesia is the consequence of blocking a retrieval-associated updating process that is required to keep old memories useful and retrievable (Dudai and Eisenberg, 2004Dudai Y. Eisenberg M. Rites of passage of the engram: reconsolidation and the lingering consolidation hypothesis.Neuron. 2004; 44: 93-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). It is also becoming clear that reconsolidation is not a universal feature of memory retrieval, rendering the identification of its generality and boundary conditions all the more important (Eisenberg et al., 2003Eisenberg M. Kobilo T. Berman D.E. Dudai Y. Stability of retrieved memory: inverse correlation with trace dominance.Science. 2003; 301: 1102-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, Nader et al., 2005Nader K. Hardt O. Wang S.-H.

Maldonado H. Protein synthesis subserves reconsolidation or extinction depending on reminder duration.Neuron. 2003; 38: 863-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Relatively few recent studies have investigated reconsolidation in relation to allocentric spatial memory (e.g., Przybyslawski and Sara, 1997Przybyslawski J. Sara S.J. Reconsolidation of memory after its reactivation.Behav. Brain Res. 1997; 84: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, Suzuki et al., 2004Suzuki A. Josselyn S.A. Frankland P.W. Masushige S. Silva A.J. Kida S. Memory reconsolidation and extinction have distinct temporal and biochemical signatures.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4787-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Spatial memory is rapidly acquired, like fear conditioning and inhibitory avoidance (Milekic and Alberini, 2002Milekic M.H. Alberini C.M. Temporally graded requirement for protein synthesis following memory reactivation.Neuron. 2002; 36: 521-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, Nader et al., 2000Nader K. Schafe G.E. Le Doux J.E. Fear memories require protein synthesis in the amygdala for reconsolidation after retrieval.Nature. 2000; 406: 722-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar), but certain training protocols can result in performance reaching an asymptote at which point no new memory encoding needs to occur because the spatial environment is adequately represented in memory for the task in hand. We hypothesized that this would be a point at which retrieval-associated reconsolidation would no longer be required unless, due to changes in the environment, new memory encoding was engaged. In other spatial learning protocols, the state of the environment may be changing all the time, with the brain systems responsible for representing allocentric space attempting to keep track of altered relationships. Under these circumstances, memory encoding will remain engaged at the time of retrieval, with the memory representations that have been subject to consolidation being rendered labile and, as a consequence, subject to reconsolidation. Securing positive findings of a differential effect of intrahippocampal anisomycin would establish boundary conditions that favor reconsolidation of spatial memory in a theoretically cogent framework using an intervention that acts in a regionally specific manner. To investigate whether a reconsolidation process is specifically engaged when the act of retrieval of spatial memory is, or is likely to be, associated with new memory encoding, we compared two distinct hippocampus-dependent water maze tasks. Only one of these tasks was likely to involve new memory encoding in association with retrieval at the equivalent point in training on each when reconsolidation was being investigated. The design of our training protocols was predicated on the capacity of the paradigms that have been used to date to reveal reconsolidation, coupled with the desire to calibrate any findings against effects upon consolidation and/or the extinction of spatial learning (Abel and Lattal, 2001Abel T. Lattal K.M. Molecular mechanisms of memory acquisition, consolidation and retrieval.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 180-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, Lattal and Abel, 2004Lattal K.M. Abel T. Behavioral impairments caused by injections of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin after contextual retrieval reverse with time.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 4667-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We began by developing a single training protocol in the water maze (Figure 1) that could be used to study consolidation (experiment 1), reconsolidation (experiment 2), and nonspecific drug effects (experiment 3). This used the “on-demand” (Panakhova et al., 1984Panakhova E. Buresova O. Bures J. Persistence of spatial memory in the Morris water tank task.Int. J. Psychophysiol. 1984; 2: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or Atlantis Platform (Spooner et al., 1994Spooner R.I. Thomson A. Hall J. Morris R.G.M. Salter S.H. The Atlantis platform: a new design and further developments of Buresova's on-demand platform for the water maze.Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 203-211PubMed Google Scholar) procedure in the first training trial of each day to monitor memory retrieval unaffected by new learning or reminding. In this procedure, the escape platform only becomes available after 60 s of trial 1 on each day, allowing that trial to serve as a reinforced memory probe trial during training and post-memory reactivation treatments. A change in the behavioral training protocol to a delayed matching-to-place (DMP) procedure was then introduced for experiments 4 and 5, with the extent of overall training kept equivalent. The relevant feature of DMP is that, irrespective of the extent of training, new memory encoding is required each day as the location of the escape platform changes. Importantly, the same extent of training (6 days) was used in both the reference memory and DMP experiments. Finally (experiment 6), we examined the impact of intrahippocampal anisomycin on extinction. Separate autoradiographic measurements of the uptake and incorporation of [14C]L-leucine were also made to establish that anisomycin was successful in inhibiting protein synthesis locally when infused into the dorsal hippocampus. Autoradiographic imaging and quantitative densitometric analysis of [14C]L-leucine uptake into the brain enabled the extent and spatial distribution of the inhibition of protein synthesis to be visualized and quantified. Typical examples of the impact of unilateral intracerebral anisomycin are shown in Figure 2. Close to the injection site, at the septal pole of the dorsal hippocampus (Paxinos and Watson, 1998Paxinos G. Watson C. The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1998Google Scholar), protein synthesis inhibition was well localized at the infusion site (Figure 2A). Inhibition in parts of the contralateral hippocampus was seen in three out of the six animals, but this is unimportant in the context of the bilateral infusions of anisomycin used in the behaviorally trained animals. At a more posterior and temporal location of the longitudinal axis, the area of inhibition was more circumscribed, with much of the ventral hippocampus unaffected (Figure 2B). There was some evidence of inhibition in extrahippocampal regions—including overlying neocortex. Figure 2C shows the animal in which this was most marked. However, there also appeared to be leakage of anisomycin from the injection site into the ventricular system, and in all animals, there were some indications of partial inhibition in periventricular tissues, such as hypothalamus (Figures 2A and 2C) and periaquaductal gray matter (Figure 2B). The patterns of inhibition found in contralateral hippocampus suggest that here too anisomycin gained access via the ventricular system, rather than spreading by bulk flow. Quantification of the autoradiographic images (Table 1) shows that the uptake and incorporation of [14C]L-leucine was substantially reduced in hippocampal cell populations close to the injection of anisomycin. In dorsal CA1, for example, tissue tracer concentrations were reduced from a mean of 98 nCi.g−1 on the aCSF-injected side to 6 nCi.g−1 on the anisomycin-injected side, a reduction of 94%. In the septal pole of the hippocampus as a whole, tracer levels were reduced by 97%. Given that residual levels of tracer in trunk blood remained quite high at the time of sacrifice (93 ± 2 nCi/ml), the contribution of the blood compartment in brain to the total tissue concentrations will prevent the measured values ever reaching zero. Thus, the primary site of action was the dorsal and middle regions of the hippocampal formation.Table 1Uptake of [14C]L-leucine into Hippocampus following Local Infusion of Anisomycin or aCSFHippocampal AreaTracer Concentration (nCi/g)Percentage ChangeaCSFAnisomycinSeptal (Dorsal)CA198 ± 186 ± 4∗−94CA2113 ± 65 ± 2∗−96CA3116 ± 175 ± 2∗−96Dentate145 ± 209 ± 5∗−94Total hippocampus123 ± 134 ± 3∗−97Temporal (Ventral)Subiculum70 ± 1518 ± 12∗−74CA199 ± 6108 ± 16+9CA2102 ± 6109 ± 10+6CA3133 ± 15128 ± 18−4Dentate125 ± 2064 ± 48∗−49Total hippocampus110 ± 1691 ± 16−17Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 6 in each group). ∗Significantly different from hippocampus injected with aCSF (p < 0.05, paired t-test). Open table in a new tab Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 6 in each group). ∗Significantly different from hippocampus injected with aCSF (p < 0.05, paired t-test). All behaviorally trained rats were sacrificed at the end of the experiment, and the brains were carefully removed from the skull and associated “headcap” containing the cannulae. Once stained, brain sections were carefully examined for tissue damage. The tips of bilateral cannulae were found to be located in the dorsal hippocampus of all rats reported above, with minimal tissue damage affecting the target structure. All animals infused with aCSF were rated as having brain damage scoring 0 or 1 (see Experimental Procedures for the scoring system). Three anisomycin-treated animals were rated as having scores of 2 or more in experiment 1, and one animal with a score of 3 was excluded from the data analysis, with the threshold for inclusion set at unilateral damage only. Five anisomycin animals were rated as having a score of 2 in experiment 2, and all were included in the analysis. In experiment 4, two anisomycin animals were rated as having scores of 3 or above and were excluded from the data analysis. The group numbers in each of the studies are of animals included after histological assessment. As both experiments 2 and 4 (below) used four trials of training per day, a control study was conducted to confirm that daily post-training injections of anisomycin into the dorsal hippocampus would preclude the consolidation of spatial memory trained in this way. Impaired overnight memory consolidation was revealed in an analysis of the proportion of time spent in the correct quadrant of the water maze during the daily probe tests (Figure 2D). Over days 1–6, the ANOVA showed no overall difference between groups (F = 3.55, df 1/13, p = 0.08), a significant improvement across successive retrieval tests (F = 9.36, df 5/65, p < 0.001) and, critically, a highly significant groups × retrieval tests interaction (F = 5.05, df 5/65, p < 0.001). A separate analysis was conducted of performance in the memory reactivation and postreactivation memory tests (sessions 7 and 8), revealing an impairment in the anisomycin-treated group (F = 8.27, df 1/13, p < 0.025). All analyses were also conducted using the measure introduced by Moser et al., 1995Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Forrest E. Andersen P. Morris R.G. Spatial learning with a minislab in the dorsal hippocampus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 9697-9701Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar of time spent in a 40 cm diameter zone around the correct location; these revealed an identical pattern of statistically significant effects (data not shown). Within-session learning (averaged across all six training sessions) indicated that the anisomycin group took longer to cross the correct location of the platform on trial 1 but nonetheless showed effective within-session learning (Figure 2E). The ANOVA revealed a decline in latency across the four daily trials (F = 35.23, df 3/39, p < 0.001) and a significant groups × trials interaction (F = 3.35, df 3/39, p < 0.05). There was a significant difference between groups on trial 1 (F = 6.16, df 1/14, p < 0.05), pointing to overnight forgetting in the anisomycin-treated animals as indexed by time to reach the platform. Training in WM2 without drug infusions revealed successful learning by the group previously treated with anisomycin (Figure 2F). Both groups showed a steady improvement in memory retrieval across the four probe trials (F = 15.54, df 3/39, p < 0.001). The groups did not differ on sessions 5 and 6 of the new learning phase (F < 1). The modest trend reflecting apparently faster learning by the group previously given aCSF (F = 3.41, df 1/13, p > 0.05) most likely reflects the benefit of the animals' successful earlier training in WM1 rather than any (nonsignificant) deficit in the anisomycin group. Indeed, a comparison of performance on session 4 of the new learning protocol (Figure 2F) with session 4 of training in the initial spatial training period (Figure 2D) confirms that the animals previously treated with anisomycin were now learning at a similar rate to the aCSF group during initial training (percent time in target quadrant: aCSF = 44.1% ± 3.9%; Ani = 47.5% ± 9.6%). Thus, the group previously treated with anisomycin could learn a spatial location in a new environment normally; i.e., it displayed no lasting functional deficit, a “behavioral histology” finding compatible with the exacting selection of animals based on true histological criteria. A deficit might have been seen had animals with partial brain damage been included, and the failure to use such exacting histological criteria could, in turn, have compromised the interpretation of experiments 2 and 4 below. Figure 3A shows performance in the daily probe tests (trial 1 of each day). The groups did not differ during training (Fs < 1) and showed equivalent excellent search performance during the memory reactivation trial of session 7 (72 hr after session 6). In absolute terms, the proportion of time spent in the target quadrant during the retrieval test of session 7 (57.78% ± 3.29% averaged across groups) was equivalent to that obtained by the aCSF group in experiment 1 (61.06% ± 6.8%). Bilateral intrahippocampal infusion of anisomycin following the memory reactivation trial of session 7 did not result in poorer performance in the postreactivation test probe the next day (F < 1). Performance declined between sessions 7 and 8 (F = 15.62, df 1/27, p < 0.001), reflecting extinction, but this decline did not differ across groups (F = 1.90, df 1/27, p > 0.10; performance in retrieval test 8: aCSF = 46.9% ± 5.4%; ANIS = 44.6% ± 4.2%). While there was a trend for the decline to be greater in the anisomycin group, it did not approach significance, despite the large group sizes. When tested again 1 week after the reactivation trial, the two groups again did not differ (F < 1). Experiment 3 was conducted to examine the nonspecific effects of intrahippocampal infusions of anisomycin on long-term spatial memory. Figure 3B shows that neither group differed during the 6 days of training with respect to time spent in the target quadrant (F < 1). An ANOVA revealed no difference between groups across retrieval sessions 8 and 9 (F < 1) and, despite an apparent trend in the 1 week test, no interaction across sessions. Importantly, performance in probe test 8 showed no decline from the end of training. In the DMP task, the animals learn a platform location during the four daily trials and a new location on each of the days thereafter for as long as training continues. An effective strategy is acquired across days, in which the rats show a small but highly significant tendency to search in the previous session's platform location on the first trial of each day (retrieval) and immediately after encoding information about the new platform location (Steele and Morris, 1999Steele R.J. Morris R.G.M. Delay-dependent impairment of a matching-to-place task with chronic and intrahippocampal infusion of the NMDA-antagonist D-AP5.Hippocampus. 1999; 9: 118-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Accordingly, memory retrieval reaches an above chance asymptotic mean that remains relatively stable across days (Figure 4A). In a target zone of 40 cm diameter centered on the varying locations of the escape platform in a 1 meter radius pool, the ratio of surface areas is 25:1, leading to a chance level of 2.5 s spent searching in the target zone (i.e., 4%; chance may actually be slightly higher, as the animals quickly develop a tendency to search away from the side walls, and the area ratio calculation underestimates this). Target search rises from 4% to 6% to a relatively stable mean of 10% to 14% across days 1 to 6, reflecting modest but significant memory (ANOVA: days F = 3.80, df 3.8/64.6 p < 0.01; Greenhouse-Geisser correction) with no difference between groups as a function of their subsequent drug treatment (F < 1). The critical comparison is the change in performance between sessions 7 and 8, each consisting of a memory retrieval trial without the possibility of escape onto the platform (Figure 4A). The ANOVA showed a significant decline between these sessions (F = 7.24, df 1/17, p < 0.025) and that the groups did not differ on session 7 (conducted 72 hr after session 6 as in experiment 2; F < 1) but did differ on session 8 (F = 9.56, df 1/17, p < 0.01). The group treated with anisomycin after memory retrieval on session 7 showed apparently complete forgetting in retrieval test 8. Relative to the estimated chance level, both groups showed above chance memory on session 7 (ps < 0.05), but only the aCSF group was above chance on session 8 (p < 0.01). This pattern is consistent with a reconsolidation effect, with the caveat that the Groups × Days interaction for sessions 7 and 8 did not quite reach significance. The reason for this may have been because the mean target search performance of sessions 1 through 6 masks day-to-day variability in the learning of each session's new location by individual animals and their memory of it the next day. As it is not possible to evaluate reconsolidation in an individual animal that performed poorly on session 7 just prior to drug treatment (even if that same animal did well on previous days), we considered only the subset of rats that reached a threshold of session 7 search time at least twice the chance level (i.e., >8% searching in the target zone). This reduced the numbers of animals assessed (from 19 to 14) and revealed a significant Group × Days interaction for sessions 7 and 8 (F = 4.94, df 1/12, p < 0.05; Figure 4B). The group mean consequently shows higher values of time spent searching the target on session 7 (16.5%) but shows chance performance again on session 8 by the anisomycin group. This legitimizes the selection of animals and argues against it having caused a mere regression to the mean. In addition, if the zone measure is calculated in a different way, looking only at the proportion of time spent in each of the six zones used throughout training, the Groups × Days interaction for days 7 and 8 remains significant (F = 5.79, df 1/13, p < 0.05; denominator df increases by 1 as an additional anisomycin animal could then be included). In absolute terms, the mean search time in the target zone for the anisomycin group dropped from 43.0% to 17.2% between days 7 and 8. Given this apparent “reconsolidation” effect, it would have been desirable to assay whether the poor memory of the anisomycin group on session 8 was transient (e.g., a retrieval deficit) and might have recovered over 7 days. Unfortunately, the DMP protocol does not lend itself to such an analysis as, over time, all animals revert to searching all over the pool as they have been trained to do with the daily relocation of the platform. This control study used the same subset of 14 animals of experiment 4 that had shown good memory retrieval on day 7 of experiment 5. After an interval of 10 days, these animals were retrained on the DMP task for 3 days, given aCSF or anisomycin the next day without memory being reactivated, and then a probe trial on session 5 (Figure 1). No differences between groups were found over days 1 through 3 (F < 1) or on day 5 (F < 1; Figure 4C). Figure 5 shows performance in the daily probe tests for the extinction experiment. The groups did not differ during the 6 days of training or during extinction (Fs < 1). A high proportion of time was spent searching in the target quadrant on the first memory retrieval trial of session 7 (52.5% ± 4.1% averaged across groups). This declined across the eight repeated unrewarded probe trials of extinction (probe tests 7 through 14; F = 8.82, df 7/70, p < 0.001). Infusion of anisomycin or aCSF immediately after these multiple extinction trials had no differential impact upon performance the next day. Target search was much lower for both groups in retrieval test 15 (session 8; mean = 34.9% ± 2.7% averaged across groups), although still above chance (t = 3.65, df 11, p < 0.005). During a further memory retrieval trial conducted 6 days later (test 16), no spontaneous recovery was seen for either group (mean across groups = 25.2% ± 3.4%; F = 1.39, df 1/11, p > 0.10), although there was a nonsignificant trend for the group given anisomycin earlier to perform slightly better (Groups × Tests interaction, F = 2.07, df 1/10, p > 0.10). When the findings of experiments 2 and 6 were compared, we observed that the overall level of performance on session 9 was significantly higher after one trial of memory “reactivation” than after eight trials of “extinction” (F = 10.47, df 1/36, p < 0.005), with no difference between groups across the two studies (F = 1.18, df 1/36, p > 0.10). Thus, eight trials of extinction did cause a greate"

We have shown that, in primary rat adipocytes, both factors regulate transcription of the insulin-responsive GLUT4 gene and that PPARγ2 detachment from the GLUT4 promoter upon thiazolidinedione binding up-regulates GLUT4 gene expression, thus increasing insulin sensitivity (Armoni, M., Kritz, N., Harel, C., Bar-Yoseph, F., Chen, H., Quon, M. J., and Karnieli, E. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 30614–30623). However, the mechanisms regulating PPARγ gene transcription are largely unknown. We studied the effects of FOXO1 on human PPARγ gene expression in primary rat adipocytes and found that both genes are endogenously expressed. FOXO1 coexpression dose-dependently repressed transcription from either the PPARγ 1 or PPARγ2 promoter reporter by 65%, whereas insulin (100 nm, 20–24 h) either partially or completely reversed this effect. Phosphorylation-defective FOXO1 mutants T24A, S256A, S319A, and T24A/S256A/S319A still repressed the PPARγ1 promoter and partially lost their effects on the PPARγ2 promoter in either basal or insulin-stimulated cells. Use of DNA binding-defective FOXO1 (H215R) indicated that this domain is crucial for FOXO1 repression of the PPARγ2 (but not PPARγ1) promoter. Progressive 5′-deletion and gel retardation analyses revealed that this repression involves direct and specific binding of FOXO1 to the PPARγ2 promoter; chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that this binding occurs in cellulo. We suggest a novel paradigm to increase insulin sensitivity in adipocytes in which FOXO1 repression of PPARγ, the latter being a repressor of the GLUT4 promoter, consequently leads to GLUT4 derepression/up-regulation, thus enhancing cellular insulin sensitivity. The newly identified FOXO1-binding site on the PPARγ2 promoter may serve as a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes. FOXO1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) are crucial transcription factors that regulate glucose metabolism and insulin responsiveness in insulin target tissues. We have shown that, in primary rat adipocytes, both factors regulate transcription of the insulin-responsive GLUT4 gene and that PPARγ2 detachment from the GLUT4 promoter upon thiazolidinedione binding up-regulates GLUT4 gene expression, thus increasing insulin sensitivity (Armoni, M., Kritz, N., Harel, C., Bar-Yoseph, F., Chen, H., Quon, M.

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) 2The abbreviations used are: PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PKB, protein kinase B; PRAs, primary rat adipocytes; IRS, insulin response sequence; Luc, luciferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; DAPI, 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DBD, DNA binding domain. family of nuclear receptors and the FOXO (forkhead box class O) family of winged helix/forkhead box factors are two key families of transcription factors that dominate the regulation of glucose metabolism and insulin responsiveness in insulin target tissues. Members of both families are crucial for a multitude of biological processes, including the cell cycle, cell death, differentiation, and metabolism, and have prominent roles in insulin signaling pathways. A convergence of nuclear receptors and forkhead pathways in general and of FOXO1 and PPARγ in particular has been implicated in the pathophysiological states of insulin resistance and diabetes, supporting the importance of these transcription factors (1.Arden K.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 416-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 2.Tran H. Brunet A. Griffith E.C. Greenberg M.E. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: RE5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite their importance to glucose homeostasis and adipocyte differentiation, the molecular mechanism(s) regulating transcription of the PPARγ gene and the roles of both PPARγ and FOXO1 transcription factors in these processes are not fully known. The PPAR family of ligand-activated transcription factors includes three PPAR isoforms (α, β/δ, and γ) that differ in their tissue distribution and ligand specificity. PPARβ/δ is expressed ubiquitously in many tissues; PPARα is found predominantly in hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes, and enterocytes; and PPARγ is expressed mainly in insulin-responsive tissues, where it has a pivotal role in adipocyte differentiation and the expression of adipose-specific genes (3.Gilde A.J. Van Bilsen M. Acta. Physiol. Scand. 2003; 178: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). There are two PPARγ isotypes (γ1 and γ2) that arise from the use of different promoters and alternative splicing (4.Fajas L. Auboeuf D. Raspe E. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M. Saladin R. Najib J. Laville M. Fruchart J.C. Deeb S. Vidal-Puig A. Flier J. Briggs M.R. Staels B. Vidal H. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18779-18789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). PPARγ2 is adipose-specific, whereas both are expressed in muscle. We have shown that, in primary adipocytes, both PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 repress GLUT4 transcription via direct and specific binding of the heterodimer PPARγ/retinoid X receptor-α to a GLUT4 promoter region (5.Armoni M. Kritz N. Harel C. Bar-Yoseph F. Chen H. Quon M.J. Karnieli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30614-30623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We discovered that rosiglitazone (an important thiazolidinedione ligand of PPARγ that improves insulin sensitivity) exerts its beneficial effect on insulin action by detaching PPARγ from its binding site on the GLUT4 promoter, thus alleviating this transrepression. However, the mechanisms regulating the PPARγ gene promoter itself are largely unknown. The winged helix/forkhead family of transcription factors is characterized by a 100-amino acid monomeric DNA-binding domain called the FOX domain. The DNA-binding domain folds into a variant of the helix-turn-helix motif and is made up of three helices and two characteristic large loops or “wings”; hence, the DNA-binding motif has been named the winged helix DNA-binding domain. Other portions of the forkhead proteins such as the DNA transactivation or DNA transrepression domains are highly divergent (6.Kaestner K.H. Knochel W. Martinez D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 142-146PubMed Google Scholar). The forkhead domain is responsible for DNA binding specificity and binds DNA as a monomer. Following a standardized nomenclature for these proteins (6.Kaestner K.H. Knochel W. Martinez D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 142-146PubMed Google Scholar), all uppercase letters are used for human (e.g. FOXO1), and only the first letter is capitalized for mouse (e.g. Foxo1). The FOXO family of transcription factors stimulates the transcription of target genes involved in many fundamental cell processes, including cell survival, cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and insulin sensitivity (reviewed in Ref. 2.Tran H. Brunet A. Griffith E.C. Greenberg M.E. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: RE5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FOXO1 is the most abundant FOXO isoform in insulin-responsive tissues such as hepatic, adipose, and pancreatic cells. Studies have shown that FOXO1 is negatively regulated by human protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt, a serine/threonine kinase that lies downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in the insulin signaling cascade, and that this regulation includes a rapid and hierarchic phosphorylation of FOXO1 at three PKB/Akt phosphorylation consensus sites, Thr24, Ser256, and Ser319 (2.Tran H. Brunet A. Griffith E.C. Greenberg M.E. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: RE5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nakae et al. (7.Nakae J. Biggs III, W.H. Kitamura T. Cavenee W.K. Wright C.V. Arden K.C. Accili D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) showed that murine Foxo1 is expressed mainly in adipose tissue and is a negative regulator of insulin sensitivity in liver, pancreatic β-cells, and adipocytes. Impaired insulin signaling to Foxo1 provides a unifying mechanism for the metabolic abnormalities of type 2 diabetes. Studying the importance of FOXO1 in both insulin signaling and tumorigenesis, we have shown that FOXO1 (previously FKHR (forkhead homologue rhabdomyosarcoma)) either represses or activates transcription from the GLUT4 gene depending on the cell type, whereas PAX3-FKHR, a chimeric gene product that is unique to human alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, enhances GLUT4 promoter activity via direct binding to specific promoter regions (8.Armoni M. Quon M.J. Maor G. Avigad S. Shapiro D.N. Harel C. Esposito D. Goshen Y. Yaniv I. Karnieli E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 5312-5324Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although both PPARγ and FOXO1 are the main transcription factors in adipose tissue and are involved in adipogenesis and insulin signaling, their interactions have rarely been evaluated in bona fide insulin target cells. Furthermore, although PPARγ is involved in multiple regulatory processes, the mechanisms regulating transcription of the PPARγ gene itself are still unknown. Therefore, this study was undertaken to identify the molecular mechanisms by which FOXO1 regulates the expression of the PPARγ gene at the level of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 transcription in primary rat adipocytes (PRAs). Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total cellular RNA was prepared from the various cells using a TriReagent kit (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) and further purified using RNeasy® columns (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Sense and antisense primers specific for β-actin, FOXO1, total PPARγ, and PPARγ2 mRNAs were synthesized based on sequences obtained from the GenBank™ Data Bank. First-strand cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification were performed using a Reverse-iT™ 1st Strand Synthesis kit (ABgene UK, Surrey, UK). Experiments performed in the absence of reverse transcriptase excluded the possibility of amplification from genomic contamination. PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining as described previously (8.Armoni M. Quon M.J. Maor G. Avigad S. Shapiro D.N. Harel C. Esposito D. Goshen Y. Yaniv I. Karnieli E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 5312-5324Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Expression Vectors and Luciferase Promoter Reporters—Expression vectors encoding FOXO1 in pcDNA3 were kindly provided by Dr. Eric Tang (University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI) and have been described previously (9.Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). These included a construct containing the full-length open reading frame of wild-type FOXO1; the constitutively active phosphorylation-defective mutants T24A, S256A, S319A, and T24A/S256A/S319A; and the DNA binding-defective mutant H215R. A control synthetic reporter (3×IRS-Luc) containing three repeats of an insulin response element consensus sequence in pGL2-Luc was also provided by Dr. Eric Tang (9.Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The human full-length PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 promoters in pGL3-Luc (hG1-P3000 and hG2-P587, respectively) were obtained from Dr. Luis Fajas (CNRS-INSERM, Louis Pasteur University, Strasbourg, France) and have been described previously (4.Fajas L. Auboeuf D. Raspe E. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M. Saladin R. Najib J. Laville M. Fruchart J.C. Deeb S. Vidal-Puig A. Flier J. Briggs M.R. Staels B. Vidal H. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18779-18789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). A series of progressively 5′-deleted promoter reporters was generated from the hG2-P587 reporter using the QuikChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All sequences were confirmed by direct sequencing. Transient Expression and Promoter Reporter Assays—Isolated adipocytes were prepared from rat epididymal fat pads and transfected according to procedures we described previously (5.Armoni M. Kritz N. Harel C. Bar-Yoseph F. Chen H. Quon M.J. Karnieli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30614-30623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, adipocytes were transfected by electroporation (three pulses at 920 V and 50 microfarads; Gene Pulser II, Bio-Rad) with 2.0 μg of either PPARγ1 or PPARγ2 promoter reporter DNA, 0–5 μg of expression vectors for FOXO1 (wild-type or mutant), and 0.5 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase. One hour later, an equal volume of incubation medium (supplemented with 7% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and either with or without 100 nm insulin) was added to the DNA-containing medium, and the cells were incubated for additional 20–24 h at 37 °C. One set of tubes was transfected with the 3×IRS-Luc promoter reporter to be used as a positive control for FOXO1 transcription activation. In each experiment, the total amount of DNA transfected was held constant by adding the relevant insertless expression vector to account for squelching by the promoter itself. Luciferase activity was assayed at room temperature using a luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega Corp.) and a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (Berthold Systems, Inc., Nashua, NH). Luciferase activity was normalized toβ-galactosidase activity as an internal control (10.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Within each experiment, values were expressed as a percentage of the induced basal PPARγ promoter activity, i.e. the activity obtained in cells transfected with promoter reporter alone. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Each experiment was repeated four to six times, with each sample analyzed in quadruplicates. Assessment of FOXO1 Proteins by Western Immunoblotting—Endogenous expression of FOXO1 proteins and the levels of the exogenously overexpressed FOXO1 (wild-type and mutant) were assessed by Western immunoblotting in either total cell lysates or subcellular fractions of nuclear extracts and cytosols. Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were prepared as described by us before (11.Armoni M. Harel C. Bar-Yoseph F. Milo S. Karnieli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34786-34795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For preparation of total cell lysates, parallel samples of mock-transfected and FOXO1-transfected PRAs, treated exactly as described for the luciferase reporter assay in 1× Reporter Lysis Buffer® (Promega Corp.), were supplemented with 1% SDS and proteases inhibitors; vortexed; and spun down 1000 × g at 4 °C. The upper fat layer was then removed, and the infranatant, including the total cell lysate fraction, was collected. Cellular protein levels were assessed with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). Samples of 10 mg of protein were analyzed by Western immunoblotting using either anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma, Rehovot, Israel) for detection of exogenously overexpressed FLAG-tagged FOXO1 or rabbit anti-FOXO1 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) for detection of endogenous FOXO1. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by ECL with a SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent kit (Pierce). Dried blots were exposed to x-ray films, scanned, and quantitatively analyzed. Immunofluorescence Studies—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were plated on 18-mm glass coverslips in 6-well plates at a density of 25,000 cells/well and transfected as described by us before (5.Armoni M. Kritz N. Harel C. Bar-Yoseph F. Chen H. Quon M.J. Karnieli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30614-30623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with expression vectors for FLAG-tagged wild-type or mutant FOXO1 were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The next day, cells were washed with magnesium-containing phosphate-buffered saline and transferred to serum-deprived medium supplemented with 2% BSA and either with or without insulin as described above. After 24 h, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained for indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-FLAG primary antibody, followed by a Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. FLAG-tagged FOXO1 proteins and 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained nuclei were visualized using an Olympus IX81 inverted fluorescence microscope. Combined DAPI/Cy3 images were generated using an Olympus DP70 digital camera with DP Controller and DP Manager software. In Vitro Translation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—In vitro translation of FOXO1 proteins and EMSAs were performed as described (5.Armoni M. Kritz N. Harel C. Bar-Yoseph F. Chen H. Quon M.J. Karnieli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30614-30623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The TnT SP6/T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) was used to generate in vitro translated FLAG-tagged FOXO1 proteins from the corresponding cDNA, and the resulting protein lysate was used in EMSA. Protein expression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, followed by phosphor-imaging analysis of proteins translated in the presence of [35S]methionine (cell labeling grade; Amersham Biosciences, Bucking-hamshire, UK). In vitro translation reactions generated sufficient protein to use in EMSAs. Sense and antisense PPARγ promoter-derived oligonucleotides corresponding to bp 270–310 of reporter hG2-P587 were synthesized (sense, GACACTGAACATGTGGGTCACCGGCGAGACAGTGTGGCAAT); these were annealed and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of polynucleotide kinase. Protein-DNA binding reactions were assembled in a total volume of 20 μl, which included 4 μl of the in vitro translated FOXO1 lysate, ∼75,000 cpm radiolabeled probe, and 4 μg of poly(dI-dC) in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 4% Ficoll, and 50 mm KCl. Competition experiments were performed in the presence of 100- and 200-fold molar excesses of unlabeled probe, which was added 10 min prior to the addition of the radiolabeled probe. For supershift assays, we used either anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 or anti-FOXO1 polyclonal antibodies (FKHR (N-18) and FKHR (H-128), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Protein lysates were preincubated with antisera for 10 min prior to the addition of the labeled probe. After incubation for 30 min at 25 °C, protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 150 V and 4 °C in 0.5× buffer containing 45 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 45 mm borate, and 1.0 mm EDTA. Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid for 15 min, dried, and analyzed by phosphorimaging. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were performed following the method of Shang et al. (12.Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar) with modifications. HEK-293 cells were chosen as a source for human PPARγ2 promoter that resides in the context of the human native nucleosome. Cells were transfected with FOXO1 in the pcDNA3-FLAG expression vector along with either 3×IRS-Luc (positive control) or empty promoter reporter as described above. The next day, cells were washed with magnesium-containing phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 2% BSA for an additional 24 h. The next day, cells were washed with magnesium-containing phosphate-buffered saline, and cross-linking of DNA and proteins was preformed using either one- or two-step techniques according to Nowak et al. (13.Nowak D.E. Tian B. Brasier A.R. BioTechniques. 2005; 39: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Cells were then sonicated in cell lysis buffer (11.Armoni M. Harel C. Bar-Yoseph F. Milo S. Karnieli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34786-34795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) to generate DNA fragments of an average size of 500 bp. One-tenth of the total cell lysate was used for purification of total genomic DNA, and the rest of the lysate was immunocleared with protein G-Sepharose and sheared salmon sperm DNA. Samples were spun down at 10,000 × g for 10 min and then immunoprecipitated either with anti-FOXO1 or anti-FLAG antibody or with negative control IgG (normal rabbit IgG; catalog no. sc-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 4 °C for 18 h. Immunoprecipitates were collected using salmon sperm DNA/protein G-agarose. DNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation, and PCR was then performed using either total DNA or immunoprecipitated DNA. Primers used for PCR corresponded to sequences within the human PPARγ2 promoter region (bp 81–325) and the region encompassing the 3×IRS sequence in pGL2. PCR products were separated on 2.0% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Endogenous Gene Expression—Endogenous gene expression at the mRNA and protein levels was examined by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analyses, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1A, isolated PRAs showed endogenous expression of mRNAs for GLUT4, FOXO1, total PPARγ, and PPARγ2. Endogenous expression of GLUT4 was taken as a marker for an insulin-responsive tissue. Western immunoblotting showed endogenous expression of FOXO1 protein in total cell lysates prepared from PRAs; under these basal conditions, FOXO1 was localized to the nuclear fraction and was undetected in the cytosol (Fig. 1B). We also determined the expression efficiency of FOXO1 in PRAs by Western immunoblotting and found that exogenous FOXO1 was overexpressed to ∼20-fold of the endogenous protein (Fig. 1C). Transcriptional Activities of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 Are Differentially Regulated by FOXO1 and Insulin—Once establishing the expression patterns of endogenous and exogenous FOXO1 proteins in PRAs, we next studied the effects of FOXO1 on human PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 gene expression at the transcriptional level. PRAs were cotransfected with luciferase-conjugated promoter reporters for either human PPARγ1 or PPARγ2 along with the expression vector for wild-type FOXO1 (Fig. 2). We found that expression of wild-type FOXO1 repressed the transcriptional activities of both coexpressed the PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 promoters in a dose-dependent manner to as much as 65% below basal levels. Incubation of cells with 100 nm insulin resulted in a dose-dependent reversal of the FOXO1 effects on the PPARγ1 promoter, with transcriptional activity reaching 102 ± 3% of basal level at the maximal FOXO1 dose applied. Insulin also interfered with FOXO1 repression of the PPARγ2 promoter, but to a lesser extent. Under similar conditions, FOXO1 activated the insulin response element from the 3×IRS-Luc reporter, which was used as a positive control, by as much as 8.5-fold (data not shown); this excludes the possibility of either cytotoxic or squelching effects in the expression system. These data show that FOXO1 equally represses transcription from the PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 promoters, whereas insulin interferes with this effect in an isoform-specific manner. Differential Contribution of FOXO1 Domains to PPARγ Promoter Regulation—The differential contribution of the various functional domains of FOXO1 to PPARγ promoter repression was studied under basal as well as insulin-mediated conditions using point mutation constructs as schematically depicted in Fig. 3A. The contribution of each of the three PKB/Akt phosphorylation sites of FOXO1 was studied using non-phosphorylatable mutants of FOXO1 (T24A, S256A, and S319A) and a triple mutant (T24A/S256A/S319A) in which all three phosphorylation sites were mutated to alanine. Cells were cotransfected with PPARγ promoter reporters along with the various FOXO1 mutants and incubated either under basal conditions or with 100 nm insulin for 24 h. We found that mutations at each of the sites did not affect the basal capacity of FOXO1 to repress the PPARγ1 promoter, but significantly reduced the derepression capacity of insulin (Fig. 3B). However, all these mutants exhibited either partial or complete loss of FOXO1 ability to repress the PPARγ2 promoter (Fig. 3C). We next used the DNA binding-defective mutant H215R to study the contribution of the FOXO1 DNA-binding domain (DBD). The H215R mutation did not affect the basal capacity of FOXO1 to repress PPARγ1, but slightly reduced promoter derepression in the presence of insulin (Fig. 3B). However, this mutant completely lost its ability to repress the PPARγ2 promoter and showed impaired responsiveness to insulin (Fig. 3C). Western blot analysis performed on total cell lysates prepared from FOXO1-transfected cells showed that all constructs used (wild-type as well as mutant) were successfully expressed as immunoreactive FLAG-tagged FOXO1 proteins to approximately the same extent (Fig. 3D), whereas mock-transfected PRAs showed no FLAG-FOXO1 immunoreactivity (data not shown). To correlate FOXO1 effects with its cellular localization, we studied the subcellular distribution of wild-type FOXO1 and the various mutants in HEK-293 cells under the same basal and insulin-mediated conditions (Fig. 4). HEK-293 cells were chosen for the immunofluorescence studies because they easily stain to show more clearly the transfected proteins and can serve as a reasonable model to simulate FOXO1 translocation in adipocytes, as they have been shown to express endogenous insulin signaling machinery as well as endogenous FOXO1 (data not shown). In accordance with previous studies (5.Armoni M. Kritz N. Harel C. Bar-Yoseph F. Chen H. Quon M.J. Karnieli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30614-30623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we found that, in the basal state, wild-type FOXO1 was distributed to the nucleus and excluded from it upon insulin stimulation. Under both conditions, the DNA binding-defective mutant H215R behaved similarly to the wild-type protein, whereas the T24A/S256A/S319A mutant, which was not responsive to PKB/Akt phosphorylation, was not excluded from the nucleus in response to insulin. cis-Elements on the PPARγ2 Promoter Mediate Its Regulation by FOXO1—Our data indicate that the DBD of FOXO1 is crucial for the repression of PPARγ2, but not of PPARγ1. Therefore, we focused our efforts on identifying cis-elements in the PPARγ2 promoter that may serve as potential FOXO1-binding sites. We performed a progressive 5′-deletion analysis of the full-length PPARγ2 promoter reporter hG2-P587 (Fig. 5). The 5′-deleted promoter reporters are shown in Fig. 5 (left panel). We found that deletion of bp 270–310 in the promoter region led to a major depletion of the ability of FOXO1 to transrepress the promoter in the absence of insulin, but did not affect the ability of insulin to interfere with FOXO1 action. An additional promoter region containing bp 181–270 also contributed to FOXO1 ability to repress the PPARγ2 promoter in either the presence or absence of insulin. FOXO1 Binding to the PPARγ2 Promoter—To investigate whether the regulation of PPARγ by FOXO1 involves a direct protein-DNA interaction, FLAG-tagged FOXO1 protein was translated in vitro and tested for its ability to bind the PPARγ2 promoter region containing bp 270–310. Full-length FOXO1 protein was expressed at the expected size as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 6A). Data from a representative EMSA are shown in Fig. 6B. The addition of FOXO1 protein to the DNA sequence at bp 270–310 led to the formation of a complex (Fig. 6B, black arrows). This binding was specific, as 100- and 200-fold molar excesses of the unlabeled probe competed for binding in a dose-dependent manner. The specificity of this interaction was indicated by a supershift assay showing retarded electrophoretic mobility of the FOXO1-DNA complex in the presence of specific anti-FOXO1 antibodies (Fig. 6B, checkered arrow). The supershift was clearly induced in the presence of either anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody or anti-FOXO1 antibody H-128, which is directed against amino acids 471–598 near the C terminus of human FOXO1, but not in the presence of anti-FOXO1 antibo"
https://openalex.org/W2025660168,"Previous studies have shown that β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase catalyzes the cleavage of β-carotene at the central carbon 15,15′-double bond but cleaves lycopene with much lower activity. However, expressing the mouse carotene 9′,10′-monooxygenase (CMO2) in β-carotene/lycopene-synthesizing and -accumulating Escherichia coli strains leads to both a color shift and formation of apo-10′-carotenoids, suggesting the oxidative cleavage of both carotenoids at their 9′,10′-double bond. Here we provide information on the biochemical characterization of CMO2 of the ferret, a model for human carotenoid metabolism, in terms of the kinetic analysis of β-carotene/lycopene cleavage into β-apo-10′-carotenal/apo-10′-lycopenal in vitro and the formation of apo-10′-lycopenoids in ferrets in vivo. We demonstrate that the recombinant ferret CMO2 catalyzes the excentric cleavage of both all-trans-β-carotene and the 5-cis- and 13-cis-isomers of lycopene at the 9′,10′-double bond but not all-trans-lycopene. The cleavage activity of ferret CMO2 was higher toward lycopene cis-isomers as compared with β-carotene as substrate. Iron was an essential co-factor for the reaction. Furthermore, all-trans-lycopene supplementation in ferrets resulted in significant accumulation of cis-isomers of lycopene and the formation of apo-10′-lycopenol, as well as up-regulation of the CMO2 expression in lung tissues. In addition, in vitro incubation of apo-10′-lycopenal with the post-nuclear fraction of hepatic homogenates of ferrets resulted in the production of both apo-10′-lycopenoic acid and apo-10′-lycopenol, respectively, depending upon the presence of NAD+ or NADH as cofactors. Our finding of bioconversion of cis-isomers of lycopene into apo-10′-lycopenoids by CMO2 is significant because cis-isomers of lycopene are a predominant form of lycopene in mammalian tissues and apo-lycopenoids may have specific biological activities related to human health.

Carotenoids are lipophilic plant pigments with polyisoprenoid structures, typically containing a series of conjugated double bonds in the central chain of the molecule, which makes them susceptible to oxidative cleavage, and isomerization from trans to cis forms, with the formation of potentially bioactive metabolites. Knowledge of the biological effects of carotenoids, particularly for the impact of oxidation on these carotenoids and the potential for beneficial effects of small quantities or harmful effects of large quantities of the resulting metabolic products, has been reviewed recently (1Wang X.D. Krinsky N.I. Mayne S.T. Sies H. Carotenoids in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York2004: 313-335Google Scholar). For provitamin A carotenoids, such as β-carotene, α-carotene, and β-cryptoxanthin, central cleavage is a major pathway leading to vitamin A formation (2Goodman D.S. Huang H.S.

This pathway has been substantiated by the cloning of the central cleavage enzyme at their 15,15′-double bond, β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase (CMO1, 2The abbreviations used are: CMO1, carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase; CMO2, carotene 9′,10′-monooxygenase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 2The abbreviations used are: CMO1, carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase; CMO2, carotene 9′,10′-monooxygenase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. formerly called β-carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase) in different species (4Wyss A.

An alternative pathway for carotenoid metabolism in mammals, the excentric cleavage pathway, had been a controversial issue among scientists for several decades. We have previously provided evidence for random cleavage of the β-carotene molecule, and we demonstrated that a series of homologous carbonyl cleavage products are produced, including retinal, β-apo-14′-, 12′-, 10′-, and 8′-carotenals, β-apo-13-carotenone, and retinoic acid from β-carotene in tissue homogenates of humans, ferrets, and rats (12Wang X.D.

However, the existence of the excentric cleavage pathway for β-carotene was not confirmed until the molecular identification of β-carotene 9′,10′-monooxygenase (CMO2) in humans and mice (15Kiefer C.

These investigators showed that the mouse CMO2, expressed in the β-carotene-synthesizing and -accumulating E. coli strains, can cleave β-carotene at its 9′,10′-double bond to form β-apo-10′-carotenal, β-apo-10′-carotenol, and its ester (15Kiefer C.

However, no further characterization of CMO2 and kinetic analysis of β-carotene cleavage into apo-10′-carotenoids by CMO2 has been reported. Lycopene, a major carotenoid from tomatoes and tomato products and a predominant carotenoid in human plasma and tissue, has been shown to be beneficial to human health against cardiovascular disease and cancer. Because lycopene has a chemical structure similar to β-carotene, it is possible that lycopene undergoes both central and excentric cleavage as well. This is supported by findings that lycopene-synthesizing and -accumulating E. coli strains exhibit a color shift after expressing mouse CMO1, but this activity was much lower toward lycopene, as compared with β-carotene (7Redmond T.M. Gentleman S. Duncan T. Yu S. Wiggert B. Gantt E. Cunningham Jr., F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6560-6565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In addition, Lindqvist and Andersson (9Lindqvist A. Andersson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23942-23948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) reported that CMO1 catalyzes the cleavage of β-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin at the central carbon 15,15′-double bond but does not cleave lycopene. In terms of CMO2, lycopene-synthesizing and -accumulating E. coli strains exhibit a color shift after expressing mouse CMO2 (15Kiefer C. Hessel S. Lampert J.M. Vogt K. Lederer M.O.

However, direct evidence regarding lycopene cleavage by CMO2 at its 9′,10′-double bond to form apo-10′-lycopenoids in mammals both in vitro and in vivo is still lacking (Fig. 1). Recently, we have provided evidence that lycopene can protect against smoke-related lesions in the lungs (19Liu C. Lian F. Smith D.E. Russell R.M. Wang X.D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3138-3144PubMed Google Scholar) and stomach (20Liu C. Russell R.M. Wang X.D. J. Nutr. 2006; 136: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) of the ferrets, which is an excellent model for use in mimicking carotenoid metabolism in humans, considering the similarities between ferrets and humans in terms of carotenoid absorption, oxidative cleavage, and their biological functions (21Wang X.D. Packer L. Kraemer K. Obermuller-Jevic U. Sies H. Carotenoids and Retinoids. AOCS Press, Champaign, IL2005: 168-181Google Scholar). However, although all-trans-lycopene is the predominant isomer in the supplement, we and other investigators observed dramatic increases in the cis-isomers of lycopene, including 5-cis-, 13-cis-, and 9-cis-isomers, in the tissues of ferrets (19Liu C.

More understanding of the significance of the metabolism of cis-lycopene will help to further elucidate the biological functions of lycopene. In the present study, using the ferret as a model, we cloned and expressed ferret CMO2 in a baculovirus system, and we characterized the CMO2 kinetic properties using both β-carotene and lycopene as substrates in vitro. Furthermore, we examined the tissue expression of CMO2 and the formation of apo-10′-lycopenoids in the ferrets supplemented with lycopene in vivo. Chemicals—Lycopene, apo-10′-lycopenal, apo-10′-lycopenol, apo-10′-lycopenoic acid, β-carotene, and lycopene 10% dry power (Lycovit® 10%) were provided by BASF Inc, Ludwigshafen, Germany. Ammonium acetate was purchased from Sigma. HPLC-grade solvents were obtained from J. T. Baker Inc. Methyl-tert-butyl ether was purchased from Aldrich. Substrate stock solutions of all-trans-β-carotene and lycopene were prepared in tetrahydrofuran under red light and stored at -80 °C until use. All standards were stored at -80 °C until used. Cloning of a cDNA Encoding CMO2 from the Ferret—Reverse transcription-PCRs were performed for cloning of full-length cDNA encoding ferret CMO2. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase using 2 μg of total RNA isolated from ferret liver as the template and pd(N)6 or NotI-d(T)18 as primers. PCR was carried out using 5 pair of primers for CMO2, designed as reported cDNA sequences for a human carotene excentric cleavage enzyme (GenBank™ accession number NM_031938). The 5′-end of the cDNA was prepared by 5′-RACE using a 5′/3′-RACE kit (Roche Applied Science). The PCR products were ligated into the pCRII TOPO vector using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced using a GigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The complete ferret CMO2 coding sequence was re-amplified by Tgo DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) from a ferret liver cDNA library, made from SuperScript Lambda System for the cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen), using the up primer from CMO2, 5′-ATGGAGGGTACCGATCAGAAAAAGGC-3′, and the down primer 5′-TCAGACTGTTACAAAGGTACCGTGG-3′. The PCR cloning was inserted into the pCRII TOPO vector (named pCRII-fCMO2), and the sequence was confirmed. Expression of Ferret CMO2 in Mammalian Cells and Immunofluorescence—To generate the ferret CMO2 expression vector, the entire coding sequence of the ferret CMO2 was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pRc-HA and fused in-frame to an HA tag (hemagglutinin epitope) at the N terminus. The plasmid is referred to as pRcHA-fCMO2. COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and the transfections of ferret CMO2 were performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). COS-1 cells were seeded on 6-well plates and transfected at 50% confluence with 2 μg of an empty vector or expression vector encoding HA-tagged ferret CMO2 (pRcHA-fCMO2). After 40 h of transfection, the aliquots of total cell lysates were prepared by boiling the cell pellet in reducing Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Expression of the fusion protein of ferret CMO2 was detected by Western blotting with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody, HA.11 (Covance, Berkeley, CA). For immunofluorescence, COS-1 cells on coverslips in 6-well plates were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, rinsed in PBS, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Anti-HA tag antibody (monoclonal antibody; Covance, CA) was diluted 1:100 in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS and applied to coverslips for 1 h. Coverslips were rinsed in PBS and incubated in fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 30 min. Images were viewed by fluorescence microscopy. Generation of Antibody against Ferret CMO2—The N-terminal 273 amino acids of CMO2 from ferret were fused in-frame to the glutathione S-transferase gene with the pGEX-20 vector and expressed in E. coli. BL21. The fusion proteins were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose resin and used to immunize rabbits at the Animal Pharm Services Inc. (Healdsburg, CA). The polyclonal antibody was purified from crude serum of rabbits by using affinity purification methods. The specificity of the antibody against ferret CMO2 was examined by its cross-reaction with purified CMO1 from mouse (generously provided by Dr. T. M. Redmond, NEI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) and human (kindly provided by Drs. A. Lindqvist and S. Andersson, University of Texas, Dallas). Expression of Ferret CMO2 in SF9 Cells—The complete ferret CMO2 coding sequence was subcloned from pRcHA-fCMO2 plasmid into the baculovirus expression vector pFastBac1 (Invitrogen) by PCR using the BamHI/SpeI site. Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (SF9) cells were transfected with the CMO2 bacmid DNA, and the viral titer of recombinant CMO2 was amplified by propagation in SF9 cells. Then SF9 cell were infected with the CMO2 recombinant baculovirus for 3 days, and cell pellets were centrifuged, washed once with cold PBS, and stored at -80 °C until use. Expression of ferret CMO2 protein in SF9 cells was confirmed by both Western blotting analysis with the purified polyclonal antibody against ferret CMO2 and Coomassie Blue stain. Enzyme Kinetic Assay—All of procedures for the enzyme preparation were carried out on ice. The SF9 cell pellets containing either infected ferret CMO2 recombinant baculovirus or uninfected were resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and homogenized in Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer for 60 s (or stroked 20 times). The homogenates were clarified by centrifugation (4 °C) at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The collected supernatants were either immediately used for enzyme assay or stored at -80 °C until further use. The aliquots of carotenoids in tetrahydrofuran (all-trans-β-carotene and lycopene stock solution) as substrates were dried by N2 under red light and then prepared in 4% Tween 40 in acetone, which is again evaporated by N2. The dried substrates were solubilized in deionized water and vortexed to obtain a clear micellar solution. The enzyme reactions were performed in a volume of 1 ml of assay buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 10 μm Fe2SO2, 3 mm NAD, 0.3 mm DTT with the enzyme (∼6 mg of protein of the supernatant or various concentrations as indicated). The mixtures were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and the cleavage reactions were initiated by adding 50 μl of the substrate (β-carotene or lycopene at various concentrations). After incubation for 60 min at 37 °C in the dark with gentle shaking, the reactions were stopped by adding 1.5 ml of 100% ethanol. The incubation mixtures were extracted twice by using 3 ml of hexane/butyl methyl ether (1:1 v/v). The combined extract was dried by N2 under red light and dissolved in 100 μl of ethanol and analyzed by the HPLC system described below. HPLC Analysis—A gradient reverse phase HPLC was used for the analysis of carotenoids and their polar metabolites as described previously, with minor modifications (23Wang X.D. Liu C. Bronson R.T. Smith D.E. Krinsky N.I. Russell R.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Briefly, the gradient reverse phase HPLC system consisted of a Waters 2695 separations module and a Waters 2996 photodiode array detector. The products of β-carotene were analyzed on a reverse phase C18 column (3 μm, 4.6 × 85 mm; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The gradient procedure was as follows: 1) 100% solvent A (acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, 1% ammonium acetate, 50:20:30, v/v) was used for 4 min, followed by a 6-min linear gradient to 50% solvent A, 50% solvent B (acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, 1% ammonium acetate, 50:44:6, v/v/v); 2) a 9-min hold followed by a 2-min linear gradient to 100% solvent B and then 100% solvent B for 10 min. A C30 carotenoid column (3 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm YMC; Waters) was used for separating the cleavage products of lycopene. The mobile phase was methanol, methyl butyl ether, 1.5% ammonium acetate (83: 15:2, v/v/v) in solvent A and methanol, methyl butyl ether, 1.0% ammonium acetate (8:90:2, v/v/v) in solvent B. Elution was at 1 ml/min with the following gradients: 100% solvent A at 3 min, proceeding linearly to 70% solvent A, 30% solvent B at 10 min, a 5-min hold followed by a 9-min linear gradient to 45% solvent A; a 2-min hold and then linear gradient to 95% solvent B at 33 min, and then a 6-min hold. The column was flushed with 100% solvent A for 15 min before the next injection. The Waters 2996 programmable photodiode array detector was set at 455 nm for carotenoid metabolites. In this HPLC system, apo-10′-carotenal and apo-10′-lycopenal were eluted at 14.9 and 11.6 min, respectively. Individual carotenoids (β-apo-10′-carotenal and apo-10′-lycopenal) were identified by co-elution with standards and absorption spectral analysis. Examination of CMO2 Tissue Expression—Total RNA was extracted by TriPure Isolation Reagent (Roche Applied Science) from different tissues of ferrets. RNA (350 ng) was transcribed to first strand cDNA by Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with 5 μm of p(dN)6 random primer. The real time quantitative PCR assay was carried out using ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system. The reaction was initiated by carry over decontamination at 50 °C for 2 min and held at 95 °C for 10 min for hot start, and then followed by 40 cycles of amplification as follows: 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Ferret β-actin was used as the endogenous control. The TaqMan probes and primers from the sequence of ferret for both CMO2 and β-actin were generated by Assays-by Design Service (ABI, Foster, CA). The following sets of primer and probes were used: CMO2, forward 5′-GGAGGGTACCGATCAGAAAAAGG-3′, reverse 5′-GTTAGCAGCGGTGCAATACAC-3′, and FAM probe TCGCGTACCGACCGCT; β-actin, forward 5′-GCCCCACGCCATCCT-3′, reverse 5′-CCGCGCTCGGTAAGGA-3′, and FAM probe CAGGTCCCGGCCAGCCA. The comparative Ct method was used for the quantitation of gene expression. Animal Study, Lung Tissue Extraction, and HPLC Analyses— The lung tissues of ferrets from our previous study (19Liu C. Lian F. Smith D.E. Russell R.M. Wang X.D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3138-3144PubMed Google Scholar) were used in the present study. The maintenance and husbandry of ferrets, as well as the procedures of lycopene supplementation in ferrets, have been described in our previous paper (19Liu C. Lian F. Smith D.E. Russell R.M. Wang X.D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3138-3144PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, male adult ferrets from Marshall Farms (North Rose, NY) were fed a semi-purified ferret diet (Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ) and supplemented with lycopene for 9 weeks. Lycopene (Lycovit® 10%, BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany, 95% as all-trans-lycopene) was dissolved into 0.5 ml of corn oil and fed orally (no gavage) to ferrets (4.3 mg/kg body weight per day in the ferret, which is equivalent to 60 mg per day in a 70-kg human) for 9 weeks. The non-lycopene supplemented ferrets were given the placebo and corn oil only. The lung tissue (0.5 g wet weight) extraction and HPLC analyses have been described elsewhere (19Liu C. Lian F. Smith D.E. Russell R.M. Wang X.D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3138-3144PubMed Google Scholar). In this HPLC system, apo-10′-lycopenoic acid, apo-10′-lycopenol, and apo-10′-lycopenal eluted at 5.3, 10.2, and 11.6 min, respectively. Lycopene metabolites were quantified relative to the internal standard by determining peak areas calibrated against known amounts of the standard. The Incubation of Apo-10′-lycopenal with the Post-nuclear Fraction of Ferret Liver—Ferret liver (∼0.5 g) was homogenized with 5 ml of cold Tris buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 8.0) using Ultra Turrax T8 homogenizer (IKA, in Germany). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1800 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The resulting supernatant represents the post-nuclear fraction for the incubations. The reactions were carried out in a final volume of 1 ml of assay buffer A containing 5 mg of post-nuclear fraction of liver homogenates with or without adding cofactors (3 mm NAD+, or 3 mm NADH). The mixtures were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and then the reactions were initiated by adding 10 μl of apo-10′-lycopenal as substrate, at the indicated concentrations (2 and 10 μm). After 1 h of shaking in a 37 °C water bath under red light, the incubations were terminated by addition of 1.5 ml of ethanol. The incubation mixtures were extracted, dried, dissolved in 100 μl of ethanol, and subjected to analysis by HPLC, as described above. Molecular Cloning, Expressing, and Intracellular and Tissue Distribution of Ferret CMO2—To identify potential homologues of ferret CMO2, reverse transcription-PCR was carried out using 5 pairs of primers, designed from the reported cDNA sequence of CMO2 from humans (GenBank™ accession number NM_031938), and the first-strand cDNA from ferret liver as the template. The products of PCR were cloned into the vector pCRII-TOPO, and the sequence was analyzed. Then the 5′-end of the cDNA was prepared by RACE-PCR using a specific primer derived from the sequence of ferret CMO2. Individual sequences of PCR fragments were assembled into a contiguous stretch of 1993 bases. The cDNA contained an open reading frame of the expected size in addition to 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences. The alignment of DNA sequences of CMO2 from the ferret showed 87% homology with human CMO2 and 81% homology with mouse CMO2. The entire coding region of ferret CMO2 is 1.62 kb in length and encodes a predicted protein of 540 amino acids (deposited in the GenBank™ with accession number AY527150). There were four conserved histidine and one glutamate residues in the ferret CMO2 (Fig. 2), which have been demonstrated as putative iron-binding residues in CMO1 (10Poliakov E. Gentleman S. Cunningham Jr., F.X. Miller-Ihli N.J. Redmond T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29217-29223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of ferret CMO2 was 82% identical to the human CMO2 and 79% identical to the mouse CMO2 (Fig. 2). Most of the amino acid differences among these three species occur in the N-terminal region of the protein. In the C-terminal region of the ferret CMO2, there was a conserved domain EDDGGVILVVI (Fig. 2) that has been considered as a CMO family signature sequence (10Poliakov E. Gentleman S. Cunningham Jr., F.X. Miller-Ihli N.J. Redmond T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29217-29223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To determine the intracellular localization of ferret CMO2, the entire coding sequence of the ferret CMO2, obtained by PCR with Tgo DNA polymerase from the ferret liver cDNA library, was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pRcHA. The cDNA was fused in-frame to the HA tag at the N terminus, referred as pRcHA-fCMO2, and expressed in COS-1 cells by transient transfection. The overexpression of the enzyme was confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3, left, the apparent molecular mass of the protein band was ∼60 kDa, as predicted). The intracellular localization of ferret CMO2 using fluorescence microscopy showed intense cytoplasmic staining without apparent nuclear staining (Fig. 3, right). To further verify that the ferret CMO2 is a homologue of human CMO2, the homogenate of COS-1 cells transfected with either pRcHA-fCMO2 or vector alone was incubated with all-trans-β-carotene for 60 min at 37 °C, and the products of the reaction were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC at 450 nm. We detected one compound from all-trans-β-carotene, which has the exact same retention time and identical spectrum with absorption maxima at 448 nm as that of an authentic standard of β-apo-10′-carotenal (data not shown). Because of variations in the transfection efficiency of CMO2 in COS-1 cells, the recombinant proteins of ferret CMO2 were expressed in a baculovirus system for enzyme kinetic assay as described below. To determine the tissue distribution of the CMO2 mRNA in ferret, real time PCR was performed on a variety of ferret tissues using the primers from ferret CMO2 and β-actin"

https://openalex.org/W2088880356,"The ability of synapses throughout the dendritic tree to influence neuronal output is crucial for information processing in the brain. Synaptic potentials attenuate dramatically, however, as they propagate along dendrites toward the soma. To examine whether excitatory axospinous synapses on CA1 pyramidal neurons compensate for their distance from the soma to counteract such dendritic filtering, we evaluated axospinous synapse number and receptor expression in three progressively distal regions: proximal and distal stratum radiatum (SR), and stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM). We found that the proportion of perforated synapses increases as a function of distance from the soma and that their AMPAR, but not NMDAR, expression is highest in distal SR and lowest in SLM. Computational models of pyramidal neurons derived from these results suggest that they arise from the compartment-specific use of conductance scaling in SR and dendritic spikes in SLM to minimize the influence of distance on synaptic efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2136124678,"Gelatinase B/matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a key regulator and effector of immunity, contains a C-terminal hemopexin domain preceded by a unique linker sequence of ∼64 amino acid residues. This linker sequence is demonstrated to be an extensively O-glycosylated (OG) domain with a compact three-dimensional structure. The OG and hemopexin domains have no influence on the cleavage efficiency of MMP-9 substrates. In contrast, the hemopexin domain contains a binding site for the cargo receptor low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1). Furthermore, megalin/LRP-2 is identified as a new functional receptor for the hemopexin domain of MMP-9, able to mediate the endocytosis and catabolism of the enzyme. The OG domain is required to correctly orient the hemopexin domain for inhibition by TIMP-1 and internalization by LRP-1 and megalin. Therefore, the OG and hemopexin domains down-regulate the bioavailability of active MMP-9 and the interactions with the cargo receptors are proposed to be the original function of hemopexin domains in MMPs.

Therefore, the OG and hemopexin domains down-regulate the bioavailability of active MMP-9 and the interactions with the cargo receptors are proposed to be the original function of hemopexin domains in MMPs. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 3The abbreviations used are: MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; 2-AB, 2-aminobenzamide; fl, full-length; GU, glucose units; HPA, helix pomatia agglutinin; IL, interleukin; LC-ESI-MS, liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; MCP-3, monocyte chemotactic protein-3; mGCP-2/LIX, mouse granulocyte chemotactic protein-2; MT-, membrane type-; NGAL, neutrophil gelatinase B-associated lipocalin; OG, O-glycosylated; RU, response units; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of MMPs. constitute a family of Zn2+-dependent proteases, which share a number of conserved protein domains (1Nagase H. Woessner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). All MMPs consist of a propeptide and a Zn2+-containing active site, and most MMPs have a C-terminal hemopexin domain. Some MMPs contain additional domains, e.g. in MT-MMPs, the hemopexin domain is connected to a membrane anchor, and in MMP-2 (gelatinase A) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B), a fibronectin domain is inserted in the active site. In MMP-9, a unique linker sequence of unknown function connects the active site and the hemopexin domain, and is more than 50 amino acids long (in contrast to ∼10 residues for the linker sequence in other MMPs). It has been considered to be an independent protein domain and has low homology with collagen type V (2Wilhelm S.M. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Eisen A.Z. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17213-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mainly because of its high proline content. Because we show in the present study that it contains O-linked glycans, it is henceforth named the O-glycosylated (OG) domain. MMP-9 degrades extracellular matrix components and cleaves a variety of soluble proteins, including cytokines and chemokines. Overexpression of MMP-9 leads to inflammation, tissue destruction, and pathology (3Opdenakker G. Van den Steen P.E. Van Damme J. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 4Parks W.C. Wilson C.L. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). Therefore, expression of MMP-9 is highly regulated at the levels of transcription, translation, and secretion. Once secreted, the activity is tightly kept in check by proenzyme latency, inhibition, and catabolism. The active site can be inhibited by interaction with the N-terminal domain of the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (5Maskos K. Bode W. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 25: 241-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition, the C-terminal part of TIMP-1 binds to the hemopexin domain of both the pro- and active MMP-9, leading to a high affinity interaction (6O'Connell J.P. Willenbrock F. Docherty A.J. Eaton D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14967-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MMP-9 may be internalized and subsequently degraded through the cargo receptor low density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP-1 or CD91) (7Hahn-Dantona E. Ruiz J.F. Bornstein P. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15498-15503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Another regulatory system for MMP-9 activity is glycosylation (8Van den Steen P.E. Opdenakker G. Wormald M.R. Dwek R.A. Rudd P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1528: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Structures of N- and O-linked sugars were determined for natural MMP-9 from human neutrophils (9Rudd P.M. Mattu T.S. Masure S. Bratt T. Van den Steen P.E. Wormald M.R. Küster B. Harvey D.J. Borregaard N. Van Damme J. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G.

Rudd P.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15695-15704Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Little information is available concerning the structures or functions of glycosylation of other MMPs, except that in MT1-MMP, the O-linked glycans on the linker peptide between the active site and the hemopexin domain are essential for the binding of TIMP-2 (11Wu Y.I. Munshi H.G. Sen R. Snipas S.J. Salvesen G.S. Fridman R. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8278-8289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Besides the catalytic site, different domains of MMPs are important for the hydrolysis of particular substrates. Collagenolysis by interstitial collagenase is dependent on the hemopexin domain and linker peptide (12Lauer-Fields J.L. Juska D. Fields G.B. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Gelatinolysis by gelatinases is more than 100-fold enhanced by the gelatin-binding fibronectin domain (13Allan J.A. Docherty A.J. Barker P.J. Huskisson N.S. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The hemopexin domain of MMP-2 binds monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), leading to MCP-3 cleavage (14McQuibban G.A. Gong J.H. Tam E.M. McCulloch C.A. Clark-Lewis I. Overall C.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1202-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). These and other examples have led to the concept of “exosites,” which bind the substrate and confer high efficiency on the subsequent cleavage (15Overall C.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 22: 51-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This concept is also interesting from a therapeutic point of view, because inhibition of the exosite interaction may be used to inhibit the cleavage of particular substrates while leaving other activities of the MMP unaffected. Because no data are available on the structure and functions of the OG domain and limited data on the function of the hemopexin domain of MMP-9, we aimed at studying the structural and functional aspects of these two domains by the generation of recombinant MMP-9 variants, with deletions or mutations. The cDNA of human MMP-9, a kind gift from Dr. G. I. Goldberg (2Wilhelm S.M. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Eisen A.Z. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17213-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was amplified by PCR with the following primers: ATATCTCGAGAGCCCCCAGACAGCGCCAGTCC (“hgelBfor”, Xho-I site underlined) and AATTCCATGGCTAGTCCTCAGGGCACTGCAGG (“hgelBrev”, Nco-I site underlined). After cleavage with Xho-I and Nco-I, the amplicon was inserted into the pMelBacB vector (Invitrogen) behind the polyhedrin promoter and the mellitin secretion signal, resulting in the vector pMelBacBMMP-9. The construct was checked by DNA sequence analysis. Sf9 cells were cotransfected with pMelBacBMMP-9 and the baculoviral Bac-N-Blue™ DNA (Invitrogen), according to the protocol of the manufacturer. This results in homologous recombination between the linearized baculoviral Bac-N-Blue™ DNA and pMelBacBMMP-9, generating viable recombinant viruses with the MMP-9 gene and a functional LacZ. The supernatant of the cotransfected cells was harvested after 72 h of incubation at 27 °C. This P1 transfection viral stock was subjected to a plaque assay in the presence of the chromogenic substrate Bluo-gal (Invitrogen). Blue recombinant virus clones were isolated and screened by PCR to detect the MMP-9 insert. Viral clones containing the insert of the correct length were expanded in Sf9 cells to form a P2 small scale high titer virus stock, which was further expanded to a large scale high titer P3 virus stock. Suspension cultures of Sf9 cells (2.106 cells/ml) were infected with 0.05 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell, and the supernatant was harvested after 3 days of incubation at 27 °C in serum-free medium. MMP-9 was purified by gelatin-Sepharose chromatography as described (16Masure S. Proost P. Van Damme J. Opdenakker G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). To generate deletion mutants of human MMP-9 lacking the hemopexin domain or the OG and hemopexin domains, a stop codon was inserted in the sequence of MMP-9 in pMelBacBMMP-9 behind the codon coding for Pro511 or for Pro447, respectively. This was performed by site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The following primers, which contain the mutations (underlined), were used for the mutagenesis: CTATGGTCCTCGCCCTTAACCTGAGCCACG and CGTGGCTCAGGTTAAGGGCGAGGACCATAG for MMP-9ΔOGHem, CTGTGCCTTTGAGTCCGTAGGACGATGCCTGC and GCAGGCATCGTCCTACGGACTCAAAGGCACAG for MMP-9ΔHem. The same strategy was used to generate a vector coding for MMP-9MutEC, in which the catalytic Glu402 and Cys468 in the OG domain are mutated into Ala. The following primers, which contain the mutations (underlined), were used for this construct: GCTCCCCCGACGGTCGCCCCCACCGGACCC and GGGTCCGGTGGGGGCGACCGTCGGGGGAGC for mutation of Cys468 and CGTGGCGGCGCATGCGTTCGGCCACGCGCTGG and CCAGCGCGTGGCCGAACGCATGCGCCGCCACG for mutation of Glu402. The OG domain in MMP-9ΔOG was deleted using a splicing-by-overlap-extension method (17Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). The coding sequence for the part of MMP-9 preceding the OG domain was amplified by PCR using the following primers: ATATCTCGAGAGCCCCCAGACAGCGCCAGTCC (“hgelBfor”) and ATCGTCCACAGGGCGAGGACCATAGAGGTGCCGG (“gbdelc5r”, overlap with hemopexin domain is underlined). The hemopexin domain was amplified by PCR with the primers CCTCGCCCTGTGGACGATGCCTGCAACGTGAAC (“gbdel5-Fbis”, overlap with OG domain is underlined) and AATTCCATGGCTAGTCCTCAGGGCACTGCAGG (“hgelBrev”). After purification, the two PCR products were mixed and again amplified using the hgelBfor and hgelBrev primers, resulting in a PCR product containing the sequence of MMP-9 without the OG domain. This PCR product was first subcloned in the pCR4-TOPO-vector (Invitrogen) in Escherichiacoli. Recombinant clones were screened and checked by DNA sequencing analysis. A clone without unwanted mutations was excised with Xho-I and Nco-I and ligated into pMelBacB, resulting in the vector pMelBacBMMP-9ΔOG. The insert was checked again by DNA sequencing. Each of these constructs was expressed and purified in the same way as for intact MMP-9 (see above). MMP-9 variants (10 μm) were activated with 0.1 μm recombinant catalytic domain of human stromelysin-1 (Calbiochem), without the presence of APMA, during 90 min at 37 °C in assay buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2). The activity at different time intervals was monitored by gelatin zymography and with a fluorogenic substrate conversion assay (18Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Binding of MMP-9 variants to the lectins Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA, specific for Ser- or Thr-linked GalNAc) and jacalin (specific for Gal-GalNAc) was tested using HPA- and jacalin-agarose (Sigma) chromatography. 100 μg of the MMP-9 variants in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and 50 mm NaCl were loaded on the lectin-agarose column. Bound MMP-9 was eluted with a gradient of 0-400 mm GlcNAc for HPA-agarose and 0-100 mm lactose for jacalin-agarose. Binding and elution was monitored by UV absorption at 254 nm and by zymography analysis of the flow-through and eluent. In-gel Enzymatic Release of N-Linked Glycans—10 μg of the MMP-9 variants were reduced and alkylated prior to SDS-PAGE. Gel bands were cut out and N-linked glycans extracted as described (19Küster B. Wheeler S.F. Hunter A.P. Dwek R.A. Harvey D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 82-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). O-Glycan Release by Ammonia-based β-Elimination—40 μg of the MMP-9 variants were applied to 0.45-μm HVHP protein-binding polyvinylidene difluoride Durapore membrane filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Filters were then washed with 2 × 2 ml of double distilled water and dried. O-Glycans were released based on the method of Huang et al. (20Huang Y. Konse T. Mechref Y. Novotny M.V. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 16: 1199-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) by incubating filters in 1 ml of 29.2% aqueous ammonium hydroxide (Sigma) saturated with ammonium carbonate (Aldrich 99.999% pure) for 40 h at 60 °C. Ammonium hydroxide and ammonium carbonate were removed by repeated evaporation to dryness with double distilled water. 100 μl 0.5 m boric acid (BDH, Aristar) was added to sample tubes and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Boric acid was removed by repeated evaporation to dryness with methanol. Dried O-glycans were labeled. 2-Aminobenzamide Fluorescent Labeling of Released Glycans—Dried glycans were fluorescently labeled with 2-AB (21Bigge J.C. Patel T.P. Bruce J.A. Goulding P.N. Charles S.M. Parekh R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) using a Ludger Tag 2-AB labeling kit (Ludger Limited, Oxford, UK). Excess label was removed by ascending chromatography on Whatman 3MM chromatography paper in acetonitrile. Glycans were washed from the paper with water. Exoglycosidase Array Digestions—2-AB-labeled glycans were digested in a volume of 10 μl for18 h at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, using the following exoglycosidases obtained from Prozyme (San Leandro, CA): bovine kidney α-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51, BKF), 1 unit/ml; jackbean α-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.24, JBM), 50 units/ml. After digestions, samples were passed through a protein-binding filter (Micropure-EZ centrifugal filter devices, Millipore) to remove exoglycosidases. Glycans were eluted from filters with water. Normal Phase HPLC—NP-HPLC separations were performed on a 2690 Alliance separation module (Waters, Milford, MA) equipped with a 474 fluorescent detector and fitted with a 4.6 × 250 mm TSKgel amide-80 column (Anachem, Luton, Beds, UK). Gradient conditions and detection were as described previously (22Guile G.R. Rudd P.M. Wing D.R. Prime S.B. Dwek R.A. Anal.

Glycan Analysis by Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS)—2-AB-labeled glycans were analyzed using an LC packings Ultimate HPLC equipped with a Famos autosampler (Dionex Ltd, Leeds, UK) interfaced with a Q-Tof Ultima Global mass spectrometer (Waters-Micromass, Manchester, UK). Chromatographic separation was achieved using a 2 × 250 mm, microbore NP-HPLC TSK gel Amide-80 column (Hichrome), 50 mm ammonium formate, pH 4.4 (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B), with a gradient of 20-70% solvent A over 100 min at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode with 3 kV capillary voltage; RF lens 60; source temp 100 °C; desolvation temperature 150 °C; cone gas flow 50 liters/h; and desolvation gas flow 450 liters/h (23Royle L.

As negative control for the cleavage by MMP-9, the substrates were incubated under identical conditions with the corresponding concentration of recombinant catalytic domain of human MMP-3, used for the activation of MMP-9 (1/100 of the molar concentration of MMP-9). Digestion was stopped by the addition of reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To compare the cleavage efficiencies, it was estimated from the gels at which concentration of the MMP-9 variants the substrate was cleaved for 50%. For IL-8 and mGCP-2/LIX, the cleavage efficiency was determined by mass spectrometry analysis as described (28Van den Steen P.E. Wuyts A. Husson S.J. Proost P. Van Damme J. Opdenakker G. Eur. J.

The binding to TIMP-1, LRP-1, and megalin was studied by SPR analysis on a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore, Sweden) as follows. Biacore sensor chips type CM5 were activated with a 1:1 mixture of 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccimide in water according the manufacturer. LRP was immobilized at 15 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.0. Megalin was immobilized at 10 μg/ml in 10mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5. TIMP-1 was immobilized at 10 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0. Remaining binding sites were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. A control flow cell was made by performing the activation and blocking procedure only. The resulting receptor densities were 31 fmol LRP-1/mm2, 25 fmol megalin/mm2, and 70 fmol TIMP-1/mm2, respectively. Samples were dissolved and analyzed at various concentrations in 100 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.005% Tween-20 pH 7.4. Sample and running buffer were identical. Regeneration of the sensor chip after each analysis cycle was performed with 1.6 m glycine-HCl buffer pH 3.0. The Biacore response is expressed in relative response units (RU) i.e. the difference in response between protein and control flow channel. Kinetic parameters were determined by BIAevaluation 4.1 software using a Langmuir 1:1 binding model and simultaneous fitting of all curves in a concentration range from 5-500 nm (global fitting). Cellular uptake and degradation of natural MMP-9 from human neutrophils and MMP-9fl was investigated in Brown Norway rat yolk sac sarcoma epithelial cells (BN16) and COS-1 cells as described previously (35Hvidberg V.

Moller H.J. Moestrup S.K. Blood. 2005; 106: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). BN16 and COS-1 cells endogenously express the megalin and LRP-1 receptor, respectively. Briefly, cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates (Nunc, Denmark) in Dulbecco modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, cells were incubated with 125I-labeled MMP-9fl or 125I-labeled natural MMP-9 (3000 cpm/well ∼ 0.5 ng) in serum-free DMEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin. In the inhibition studies, BN16 and COS-1 cells were incubated for 30 min with receptor-associated protein (RAP; 100 μg/ml), polyclonal rabbit anti-megalin (100 μg/ml) and anti-LRP-1 (300 μg/ml) antibody, respectively, or non-immune anti-myoglobin antibody (100 μg/ml or 300 μg/ml) prior to addition of radiolabeled protein. Degradation of 125I-labeled MMP-9fl or 125I-labeled natural MMP-9 in lysosomes was inhibited by addition of 300 μm chloroquine (Fluka) and leupeptin (Sigma). After incubation, the medium was harvested and trichloroacetic acid was added to it. In the meantime, the cells were washed and hereafter lysed to allow determination of cell-associated radioactivity. Radioactivity in the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction of the medium represented degraded protein. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out using a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics with an An60Ti rotor. Samples were analyzed at concentrations between 0.075 and 0.3 mg/ml in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2 at 50,000 rev./min. Scans were collected at 150-s intervals at 230 nm. Sedimentation coefficients were determined using the time derivative method (37Stafford III W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) and were corrected for the effects of buffer composition. The partial specific volume of each protein was calculated from its amino acid and carbohydrate composition. The theoretical sedimentation coefficients of various model structures were calculated using the program HYDROPRO (38Garcia De La Torre J. Huertas M.L. Carrasco B. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling was performed on a Silicon Graphics Fuel workstation using InsightII and Discover software (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). Figures were produced using the program Molscript (39Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). The molecular models of MMP-9 and the constructs were based on the crystal structure of the N-terminal domains of MMP-9 (40Elkins P.A. Ho Y.S. Smith W.W. Janson C.A. D'Alessio K.J. McQueney M.S. Cummings M.D. Romanic A.M. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1182-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and the hemopexin domain in the crystal structure of MMP-2 (41Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Various models of the OG domain were generated to link the N- and C-terminal domains. The fully extended model of OG domain was built using InsightII and then restrained simulated annealing was used to generate structures of an average extension of 2.6 Å per residue (10Mattu T.S. Royle L. Langridge J. Wormald M.R. Van den Steen P.E. Van Damme J. Opdenakker G. Harvey D.J. Dwek R.A. Rudd P.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15695-15704Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The extended model of OG domain allowing for the disulfide bond between the OG domain and the hemopexin domain was generated in a similar way, but in addition fixing the distance between Cys468 and the C-terminal residue of the OG domain. Compact models of the OG domain were generated by positioning the N-terminal and C-terminal domains as required to obtain a distance constraint between the first and last residue of the OG domain. In each case, the N-terminal and C-terminal domains were then added before a final round of energy minimization. N-Linked and O-linked glycan structures, chosen on the basis of the sequencing results, were generated using the data base of glycosidic linkage conformations (42Wormald M.R. Petrescu A.J. Pao Y.L. Glithero A. Elliott T. Dwek R.A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 371-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and in vacuo energy minimization to relieve unfavorable steric interactions. For the N-linked glycans, Asn-GlcNAc linkage conformations were based on the observed range of crystallographic values (43Petrescu A.J. Milac A.L. Petrescu S.M. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), the torsion angles around the Asn Cα-Cβ and Cβ-Cγ bonds then being adjusted to eliminate unfavorable steric interactions between the glycans and the protein surface. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Domain Variants of MMP-9—Five recombinant protein variants of gelatinase B/MMP-9 were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1a). Each of the mutants retained its affinity for gelatin and was therefore purified to homogeneity in a similar way as the full-length enzyme, i.e. by substrate-affinity chromatography on gelatin-Sepharose. Molecular Mass and Dimerization of the Recombinant Variants of MMP-9—Reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE tests were used to determine relative molecular weight and dimerization patterns of the different recombinant variants of MMP-9 (Fig. 1b). Full-length recombinant MMP-9 (MMP-9fl) migrated at a slightly lower position than natural MMP-9 from human neutrophils, probably because of differences in glycosylation (see below). Interestingly, deletion of the OG or the hemopexin domain resulted in a similar decrease in molecular mass, although the OG domain is only 64 amino acids long, whereas the hemopexin domain contains 196 amino acids. This finding might be explained by the O-glycosylation of the OG domain (see below). An interesting feature of MMP-9 is the formation of dimers/multimers, which are SDS-resistant but can be dissociated by reduction. In contrast to the variants containing the OG domain, MMP-9ΔOG and MMP-9ΔOGHem showed only monomers on non-reducing SDS-PAGE and in analytical ultracentrifugation experiments (see below). This indicates that the OG domain is essential and sufficient for dimerization/multimerization. Though, the single cysteine residue in the OG domain, absent in MMP-9mutEC, is not essential for dimerization/multimerization. The exact mechanisms of dimerization remain therefore unknown.

https://openalex.org/W2090636372,"This study investigated whether inducible heme oxygenase-1[corrected] (HO-1) [corrected] is targeted to mitochondria and its putative effects on oxidative metabolism in rat liver. Western blot and immune-electron microscopy in whole purified and fractionated organelles showed basal expression of HO-1 protein in both microsomes and mitochondria (inner membrane), accompanied by a parallel HO activity. Inducers of HO-1 increased HO-1 targeting to the inner mitochondrial membrane, which also contained biliverdin reductase, supporting that both enzymes are in the same compartmentalization. Induction of mitochondrial HO-1 was associated with a decrease of mitochondrial heme content and selective reduction of protein expression of cytochrome oxidase (COX) subunit I, which is coded by the mitochondrial genome and synthesized in the mitochondria depending on heme availability; these changes resulted in decreased COX spectrum and activity. Mitochondrial HO-1 induction was also associated with down-regulation of mitochondrial-targeted NO synthase expression and activity, resulting in a reduction of NO-dependent mitochondrial oxidant yield; inhibition of HO-1 activity reverted these effects. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time localization of HO-1 protein in mitochondria. It is surmised that mitochondrial HO-1 has important biological roles in regulating mitochondrial heme protein turnover and in protecting against conditions such as hypoxia, neurodegenerative diseases, or sepsis, in which substantially increased mitochondrial NO and oxidant production have been implicated."
https://openalex.org/W2094688477,"Axonal growth is fundamental to the establishment of neuronal connectivity in the brain. However, the cell-intrinsic mechanisms that govern axonal morphogenesis remain to be elucidated. The ubiquitin ligase Cdh1-anaphase-promoting complex (Cdh1-APC) suppresses the growth of axons in postmitotic neurons. Here, we report that Cdh1-APC operates in the nucleus to inhibit axonal growth. We also identify the transcriptional corepressor SnoN as a key target of neuronal Cdh1-APC that promotes axonal growth. Cdh1 forms a physical complex with SnoN and stimulates the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of SnoN in neurons. Knockdown of SnoN in neurons significantly reduces axonal growth and suppresses Cdh1 RNAi enhancement of axonal growth. In addition, SnoN knockdown in vivo suggests an essential function for SnoN in the development of granule neuron parallel fibers in the cerebellar cortex. These findings define Cdh1-APC and SnoN as components of a cell-intrinsic pathway that orchestrates axonal morphogenesis in a transcription-dependent manner in the mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W2078396690,"Early in development, excitatory synapses transmit with low efficacy, one mechanism for which is a low probability of transmitter release (Pr). However, little is known about the developmental mechanisms that control activity-dependent maturation of the presynaptic release. Here, we show that during early development, transmission at CA3-CA1 synapses is regulated by a high-affinity, G protein-dependent kainate receptor (KAR), which is endogenously activated by ambient glutamate. By tonically depressing glutamate release, this mechanism sets the dynamic properties of neonatal inputs to favor transmission during high frequency bursts of activity, typical for developing neuronal networks. In response to induction of LTP, the tonic activation of KAR is rapidly down regulated, causing an increase in Pr and profoundly changing the dynamic properties of transmission. Early development of the glutamatergic connectivity thus involves an activity-dependent loss of presynaptic KAR function producing maturation in the mode of excitatory transmission from CA3 to CA1."
https://openalex.org/W2089411255,"Annexin 1 (AnxA1) is a multifunctional phospholipid-binding protein associated with the development of metastasis in some invasive epithelial malignancies. However, the role of AnxA1 in the migration/invasion of epithelial cells is not known. In this study, experiments were performed to investigate the role of AnxA1 in the invasion of a model epithelial cell line, SKCO-15, derived from colorectal adenocarcinoma. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of AnxA1 expression resulted in a significant reduction in invasion through Matrigel-coated filters. Localization studies revealed a translocation of AnxA1 to the cell surface upon the induction of cell migration, and functional inhibition of cell surface AnxA1 using antiserum (LCO1) significantly reduced cell invasion. Conversely, SKCO-15 cell invasion was increased by approximately 2-fold in the presence of recombinant full-length AnxA1 and the AnxA1 N-terminal-derived peptide mimetic, Ac2-26. Because extracellular AnxA1 has been shown to regulate leukocyte migratory events through interactions with n-formyl peptide receptors (nFPRs), we examined the expression of FPR-1, FPRL-1, and FPRL-2 in SKCO-15 cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR and identified expression of all three receptors in this cell line. Treatment of SKCO-15 cells with AnxA1, Ac2-26, and the classical nFPR agonist, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, induced intracellular calcium release consistent with nFPR activation. Furthermore, the nFPR antagonist, Boc2, abrogated the AnxA1 and Ac2-26-induced intracellular calcium release and increase in SKCO-15 cell invasion. Together, these results support an autocrine/paracrine role for membrane AnxA1 in stimulating SKCO-15 cell migration through nFPR activation. The findings in this study suggest that activation of nFPRs stimulates epithelial cell motility important in the development of metastasis as well as wound healing."

https://openalex.org/W2033907545,"Maturation of presynaptic transmitter secretion machinery is a critical step in synaptogenesis. Here we report that a brief train of presynaptic action potentials rapidly converts early nonfunctional contacts between cultured hippocampal neurons into functional synapses by enhancing presynaptic glutamate release. The enhanced release was confirmed by a marked increase in the number of depolarization-induced FM4-64 puncta in the presynaptic axon. This rapid presynaptic maturation can be abolished by treatments that interfered with presynaptic BDNF and Cdc42 signaling or actin polymerization. Activation of Cdc42 by applying BDNF or bradykinin mimicked the effect of electrical activity in promoting synaptic maturation. Furthermore, activity-induced increase in presynaptic actin polymerization, as revealed by increased concentration of actin-YFP at axon boutons, was abolished by inhibiting BDNF and Cdc42 signaling. Thus, rapid presynaptic maturation induced by neuronal activity is mediated by presynaptic activation of the Cdc42 signaling pathway."

The present study sought to assess the effects of chronic PGC-1alpha deficiency on metabolic flux through the hepatic gluconeogenic, fatty acid oxidation, and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways. To this end, hepatic metabolism was assessed in wild-type (WT) and PGC-1alpha(-/-) mice using isotopomer-based NMR with complementary gene expression analyses. Hepatic glucose production was diminished in PGC-1alpha(-/-) livers coincident with reduced gluconeogenic flux from phosphoenolpyruvate. Surprisingly, the expression of PGC-1alpha target genes involved in gluconeogenesis was unaltered in PGC-1alpha(-/-) compared with WT mice under fed and fasted conditions. Flux through tricarboxylic acid cycle and mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation pathways was also diminished in PGC-1alpha(-/-) livers. The expression of multiple genes encoding tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation enzymes was significantly depressed in PGC-1alpha(-/-) mice and was activated by PGC-1alpha overexpression in the livers of WT mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that chronic whole-animal PGC-1alpha deficiency results in defects in hepatic glucose production that are secondary to diminished fatty acid beta-oxidation and tricarboxylic acid cycle flux rather than abnormalities in gluconeogenic enzyme gene expression per se."

CK2 has been shown to act as a positive modulator of Wnt/β-catenin/Lef-Tcf pathway, suppressing β-catenin degradation and β-catenin binding to APC (19Song D.H. Dominguez I. Mizuno J. Kaut M.

Overexpression of CK2 in ventral blastomeres of Xenopus embryos stimulates dorsal axis formation, whereas expression of a kinase-dead CK2 mutant blocks ectopic axis formation in response to Xwnt8 (20Dominguez I. Mizuno J. Wu H. Song D.H. Symes K. Seldin D.C. Dev. Biol. 2004; 274: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Reported as “constitutively active” in cells, CK2 has been suggested to play an important, but passive, role in signaling (21Pinna L.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The ability of overexpression or inhibition of CK2 to affect aspects of early development suggests a pivotal role of CK2 in Wnt/β-catenin/Lef-Tcf pathway (20Dominguez I. Mizuno J. Wu H. Song D.H. Symes K. Seldin D.C. Dev. Biol. 2004; 274: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) but provides no insight as to whether the effects of CK2 are the result of “activation.” Our hypothesis is that the role of CK2 is not “passive” and that of a constitutively active protein kinase but rather that of a kinase regulated by upstream signaling. In support of this hypothesis are the observations that CK2 activity may be sensitive to phosphatidylinositol turnover (22Solyakov L. Cain K. Tracey B.M. Jukes R. Riley A.M. Potter B.V. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43403-43410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and to phosphorylation by non-receptor tyrosine kinases (23Donella-Deana A. Cesaro L. Sarno S.

These data piqued our interest in investigating whether or not CK2 was activated by Wnt stimulation. The results show that CK2 is activated by stimulation of Wnt3a operating via Frizzled-1, heterotrimeric G proteins, and Dishevelled-2 in the canonical Wnt/β-catenin/Lef-Tcf pathway of mammalian cells. Cell Culture—The mouse F9 teratocarcinoma (F9) cells (from ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, South Logan, UT) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. F9 clones stably expressing rat Frizzled-1 (Rfz1), β2-adrenergic receptor/rat Frizzled-1 (β2AR/Rfz1) chimera, or β2-adrenergic receptor/rat Frizzled-2 (β2AR/Rfz2) chimera were grown and selected in the presence of 100 ng/ml of the neomycin analogue G418 as previously described (24Liu T. Liu X. Wang H. Moon R.T. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33539-33544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—F9 cells grown in monolayer were serum starved for 8 h prior to stimulation by either Wnt3a (10 ng/ml) or isoproterenol (ISO, 10 μm) for the periods indicated. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of aprotinin, 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 100 nm okadaic acid). Samples (2 mg of protein) of whole-cell lysates were incubated with 8 μl of CK2α antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) immobilized on protein A/G-Sepharose. Immunocomplexes were washed with lysis buffer three times and then solubilized in Laemmli's solution (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). Whole-cell lysates and samples from immunoprecipitation were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose blots electrophoretically. The blots were blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin and probed with antibody against CK2α (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), CK2α′ (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX), CK2β (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), β-catenin (Sigma-Aldrich), Dvl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Gαo (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) and Gαq (BD Transduction Laboratories). Immune complexes were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method, according to the manufacturer's instructions. In Vitro CK2 Kinase Activity Assay—CK2 activity was analyzed as previously described (26Kuenzel E.A. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitated CK2α or CK2α′ from whole-cell lysates were washed with kinase assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 nm okadaic acid) and then incubated with 120 μm substrate peptide (RRRDDDSDDD; Upstate Biotechnology) in kinase assay buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP, 160 μm GTP, and 25 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 25 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were spotted onto a P81 Whatman filter membrane. Air-dried membranes were washed with 0.75% H3PO4 three times to eliminate any unincorporated [γ-32P]GTP. Incorporated γ-32P in substrates were measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Samples were assayed in triplicate. β-Catenin Stabilization Assay—F9 cells stably transfected with either Rfz1 receptor or β2AR/Rfz1 chimeric receptor were treated with Wnt3a (10 ng/ml) or isoproterenol (10 μm), respectively, for the time periods indicated. To determine cytoplasmic levels of β-catenin, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of aprotinin, 10 μg/ml of leupeptin). Whole-cell lysate was incubated with ConA-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h and centrifuged to remove membrane-associated β-catenin. The supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. For immunoblotting the membrane was blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin for overnight and probed with anti-β-catenin antibody. The presence of β-catenin was detected by use of the enhanced chemiluminescence method. Lef/Tcf-sensitive Reporter Gene Assay—F9 clones stably transfected with pTOPFLASH and co-transfected with either Rfz1 or β2AR/Rfz1 chimera were stimulated with Wnt3a (10 ng/ml) or isoproterenol (10 μm), respectively, for the indicated periods. Cell lysates were collected in reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and subjected to luciferase activity assay. Briefly, 10 μl of cell lysates were incubated for 10 s with 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 0.67 mm luciferin, 0.27 mm coenzyme A, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.1 mm MgCO3, 4 mm MgSO4, and 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, and the intensity of luminescence was immediately measured using a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507, Berthold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN). Samples were assayed in triplicate, and the luciferase activity was normalized based on protein concentration. For experiments needing transient transfection, F9 cells were co-transfected with 0.2 μg of pcDNA3 plasmids harboring the cDNAs encoding Gαq, Gαo, Gα11, or TAP-tagged Dvl2 and 0.15 μg of reporter plasmid Super8XTOPFLASH or mutated reporter plasmid Super8X FOPFLASH (27Veeman M.T. Slusarski D.C. Kaykas A. Louie S.H. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 680-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) for 24 h using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested in reporter lysis buffer following exposure to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 8 h. Samples were assayed in triplicate, and luciferase activity was measured as described above. Knock Down of Dvl 2 and CK2 Subunits by siRNA—At least 3 pairs of sense and antisense oligonucleotides were designed and synthesized by Ambion (Austin, TX) for each of the following molecules: mouse Dishevelled 2 (NM_007888) and mouse CK2 subunit α (NM_007788), α′ (NM_009974), and β (NM_009975). Each pair of oligos was annealed in 20 μl of annealing buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 1 h. F9 cells were treated with 100 nm annealed siRNA by using SiLentFect (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, siRNA were incubated with 4 μl of SiLentFect for 20 min in 50 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and then the mixture was added into 1 ml of growth medium in a 12-well plate in which F9 cells had been grown to 80% confluency. After siRNA treatment for 48 h, cells were lysed and subjected to Lef/Tcf reporter gene assay. The efficiency of knocking down CK2α, CK2α′, CK2β, and Dvl2 was detected by Western blot with antibody against each individual protein. The sequences of siRNA oligos, which are the most effective in knock down of targeted proteins, are listed as follows. The siRNA oligos UGGAAUAUUUCAUGGACtt and GUCCAUGAAAUAUUCCACCtg are for targeting CK2α. The siRNA oligos GGGUGGUUGUAAAAAUUCUtt and AGAAUUUUUACAACCACCCtc are for targeting CK2α′. The siRNA oligos GGAAGUCUAUGGUUUUAGtt and CUAAAAACCAUAGACUUCCtg are for targeting CK2β. The siRNA oligos GGAAGAGAUCUCCGAUGACtt and GUCAUCGGAGAUCUCUUCCtt are for targeting Dvl2. After treatment of specific CK2 siRNA for 48 h, cells stably expressing Rfz1 and TOPFLASH were stimulated with Wnt3a for 5–6 h. Cell lysates were collected, and the Lef/Tcf-sensitive luciferase reporter gene activity was determined. Knock Down of Gα Subunits—To knock down Gα subunits, F9 clones expressing β2AR/Rfz1 receptor were treated with phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (S-ODN, cell culture grade, high pressure liquid chromatography purified; Operon Technologies, Huntsville, AL) antisense to specific G protein α subunits for 72 h as previously described (28Liu X. Liu T. Slusarski D.C. Yang-Snyder J. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Wang H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14383-14388Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). CK2 Is Activated by Stimulation of the Wnt/β-Catenin/Lef-Tcf Pathway—Mouse F9 embryonic totipotent teratocarcinoma cells were stably transfected with the β2AR/Rfz1 chimeric receptor, a chimera that can activate the Wnt/β-catenin/Lef/Tcf canonical pathway by activation of the receptor with the β-adrenergic agonist ISO (10 μm). The ability to quantify chimeric receptor expression and to activate the Frizzled-1 downstream pathway was the basis for selecting these clones for the initial examination of possible CK2 activation. Treating the F9 β2AR/Rfz1 stable transfectants with isoproterenol provoked a sharp stimulation of Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription (Fig. 1A). The activation of Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription peaks at 5–6 h poststimulation of the Frizzled-1 pathway. Activation of Frizzled-1 likewise was found to stimulate CK2 activity (Fig. 1B). This stimulation by Frizzled-1 provoked an increase in CK2 activity within 15 min of treatment with β-agonist. CK2 activity remained elevated (∼50%) for 30 min and thereafter declined to baseline values within 60 min of Frizzled-1 stimulation. Immunoblotting of CK2 displays no corresponding changes in the cellular level of this protein kinase (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Wild-type F9 cells and stably transfected F9 clones expressing either the β2AR/Rfz1 (β2/Fz1) or the β2AR/Rfz2 (β2/Fz2) chimeric receptors were stimulated for 30 min and the CK2 activity then measured (Fig. 1C). Only those clones expressing the β2AR/Rfz1 chimera displayed activation of CK2 in response to stimulation of the Frizzled-1 pathway. Stimulation of the wild-type F9 cells, in contrast, failed to stimulate CK2 activity. Stimulation of the Frizzled-2 pathway that links to changes in the intracellular levels of Ca2+ and cyclic GMP (29Ahumada A. Slusarski D.C. Liu X. Moon R.T. Malbon C.C. Wang H.Y. Science. 2002; 298: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) likewise failed to stimulate CK2 activity. The observations derived from the study of F9 clones expressing the β2AR/Rfz1 chimera were tested further using F9 clones expressing bona fide rat Frizzled-1 (Fz1) and treated with purified, active Wnt3a (Fig. 1D). Treating the clones expressing authentic Fz1 with purified Wnt3a provokes a rapid increase in CK2 activity, ∼60% increase within the first 30 min. The activation of CK2 activity in response to Wnt3a appears to peak at 15–30 min poststimulation, declining to near basal levels within 60 min. The ability of Wnt3a to stimulate CK2 activity was also measured in human embryonic kidney 293 and mouse NIH3T3 cells transiently transfected to express Fz1; both cell lines responded as do the F9 cells (Fig. 1, E and F). Thus, activation of Frizzled-1 with Wnt3a stimulates a rapid but transient increase in the activity of CK2, confirming and extending the data obtained in clones expressing the β2AR/Rfz1 chimera (compare Fig. 1, B and D). CK2 Inhibitors Block Wnt/β-Catenin/Lef-Tcf Signaling—To test the linkage between Wnt activation of the Wnt/β-catenin/Lef-Tcf signaling and the role of CK2, we explored the effects of chemical inhibitors of CK2 on the Lef/Tcf-dependent transcriptional response to stimulation either of the β2AR/Rfz1 chimera or of Frizzled-1 (Fig. 2). Apigenin (4′,5,7-trihydroxyflavone) inhibits CK2 activity (30Sarno S. de Moliner E. Ruzzene M. Pagano M.A. Battistutta R. Bain J. Fabbro D. Schoepfer J. Elliott M. Furet P. Meggio F. Zanotti G. Pinna L.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Treating F9 clones with apigenin (20 μm) leads to a dramatic inhibition of Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription in response to activation of the β2AR/Rfz1 chimera by β-agonist (Fig. 2A). Measured over 7 h of activation of the β2AR/Rfz1 chimera, Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription remained at essentially base line in the presence of this CK2 inhibitor. The inhibition of β2AR/Rfz1 chimera-stimulated Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription by apigenin was dose dependent, with 10 μm concentrations of this flavone derivative capable of inhibiting the response by ∼50% (Fig. 2B). The Frizzled-1 chimera-mediated stimulation of the Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription was nearly abolished by 15–20 μm apigenin (Fig. 2B). In F9 clones stably expressing the rat Frizzled-1, apigenin was found to suppress the ability of Wnt3a to activate Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription (Fig. 2C). Similar experiments with 2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole (DMAT), a highly selective and potent CK2 inhibitor (31Pagano M.A. Meggio F. Ruzzene M. Andrzejewska M. Kazimierczuk Z. Pinna L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), displayed the same ability to block Frizzled-1-dependent activation of the Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription (Fig. 2D). Chemical inhibitors for other signaling kinases (e.g. protein kinase C and protein kinase A) were without effect (data not shown), suggesting a critical role of CK2 in the Wnt/β-catenin/Lef-Tcf response. We tested further the effects of inhibition of CK2 activity on Wnt3a-stimulated β-catenin stabilization in F9 clones expressing rat Frizzled-1 (Fig. 2E). F9 clones treated with Wnt3a displayed a time-dependent stabilization and accumulation of intracellular β-catenin. Wnt3a stimulated a 10-fold increase in free β-catenin levels within 4 h of stimulation. The Wnt3a-stimulated accumulation of β-catenin was markedly attenuated in the clones treated with apigenin. Quantification of the levels of β-catenin in response to Wnt3a stimulation in the absence and presence of apigenin confirms the data obtained using Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription as a read-out (Fig. 2, compare panels A and F). These results suggest that CK2 acts upstream of β-catenin to activate Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription. Suppression of CK2α Subunits Attenuates Activation of Wnt/β-Catenin/Lef-Tcf Signaling—The CK2 holoenzyme is composed of two catalytic subunits (αα, αα′, or α′α ′) paired with two non-catalytic β subunits. CK2 catalytic subunits as well as their holoenzymes are enzymatically active. The functions of α and α′ are not completely redundant, because CK2α′ null mice are sterile and display a defect in spermatogenesis (35Escalier D. Silvius D. Xu X. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2003; 66: 190-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In view of the ability of chemical inhibitors of CK2 to block Wnt3a signaling via the canonical pathway, we investigated the effects of suppressing expression of CK2 subunits. We adopted a knockdown (KD) strategy that makes use of unique siRNAs to suppress expression of individual subunits. Cells were treated with siRNA targeting specific subunits CK2α, CK2α′, and CK2β, and Wnt3a-stimulated Lef/Tcf-sensitive transcription was assayed (Fig. 3, Table 1). The siRNA designed for each subunit was found to be effective in suppressing the expression of the targeted subunit (Fig. 3B, Table 1). KD produced by siRNA treatment was effective as determined by immunoblotting.TABLE 1The effects of siRNA on expression of CK2 α, α′, and β subunits, as well as Wnt3a-stimulated Lef/Tcf-sensitive transcriptionsiRNAEffect on transcriptionProtein levelCK2αCK2α′CK2β%%—100100100100CK2α353611845CK2α′641035493CK2β991009242CK2α/α42415642 Open table in a new tab Treating cells with siRNA targeting either CK2α or CK2α′ attenuates Wnt3a-stimulated Lef/Tcf-sensitive transcription, much like the use of selective chemical inhibitors of CK2. Treating cells with siRNA targeting CK2β, in contrast, had no effect on the ability of Wnt3a to activate Lef/Tcf-sensitive transcription. These data demonstrate that CK2α subunits are essential in the signaling from Wnt3a to the canonical pathway as measured by activation of Lef/Tcf-sensitive gene expression by Wnt3a. Heterotrimeric G Proteins Mediate Wnt Activation of CK2—We examined signaling downstream of Frizzled-1 in the activation of CK2. Frizzled-1 signaling has been shown previously to require activation of heterotrimeric G proteins in mammalian cells, Xenopus, and zebrafish embryos, as well as in Drosophila (32Malbon C.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Both Gαq and Gαo are required for stabilization of β-catenin as well as activation of Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription in canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (6Liu T. DeCostanzo A.J. Liu X. Wang H. Hallagan S. Moon R.T. Malbon C.C. Science. 2001; 292: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Pertussis toxin catalyzes ADP ribosylation on the Go/i family of G proteins and inhibits their functions. To test whether G protein mediated CK2 activation in Wnt/Frizzled-1 signaling, we pretreated F9 cells with pertussis toxin. Pertussis toxin completely blocked CK2 activation in β2AR/Rfz1-expressing cells stimulated by β-agonist (Fig. 4A). The result indicated that activation of one or more members of the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi family (Gαi1–3, Gαo, Gαt1,2) of G proteins was necessary for CK2 activation. To test directly which G protein mediates CK2 activation in Wnt/Frizzled-1 signaling, we used antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) to knock down specific Gα subunit expression in F9 clones (6Liu T. DeCostanzo A.J. Liu X. Wang H. Hallagan S. Moon R.T. Malbon C.C. Science. 2001; 292: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). F9 clones expressing β2AR/Rfz1 chimera were treated with antisense ODN targeting Gαq, Gαo, or Gαi2 for 72 h. Following the KD of individual Gα subunits, the Frizzled-1 chimera-expressing clones were stimulated with β-agonist for 15 min and CK2 activity assayed. Knock down of either Gαq or Gαo blocks the activation of CK2 following stimulation of the Frizzled-1 pathway (Fig. 4A). KD of Gαi2, in contrast, did not affect the ability of the Frizzled-1 chimera to activate CK2. We tested the ability of KD of Gαq, Gαo, and Gαi2 to impact Frizzled-1 stimulation of Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription in these same cells (Fig. 4B). KD of Gαq or Gαo, but not Gαi2, blocks not only CK2 activation but also the Lef/Tcf reporter gene response to stimulation (Fig. 4B). Immunoblot analysis of the G protein subunits demonstrates that antisense ODNs targeting specific G protein subunits were effective in selective suppression of the expression of Gαq, Gαo, and Gαi2 (Fig. 4C). These results show that Gαq and Gαo are required for CK2 activation and Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription in response to Wnt. To further probe the role of Gαq and Gαo in CK2 activation, constitutively active mutant forms of G proteins were expressed in the F9 clones. Q209LGαq (QLGαq), Q205LGαo (QLGαo), and Q209LGα11 (QLGα11) mutants are deficient in the GTPase activity intrinsic to α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins that is responsible for “turning off” Gα subunit activation. The G protein mutant versions were expressed transiently in F9 cells, and the CK2 activity was measured (Fig. 4D). Expression of Q209LGαq stimulates constitutive activation of CK2 in the absence of Frizzled-1 activation (Fig. 4D). Expression of Q205LGαo also stimulates constitutive activation of CK2. Expression of constitutively active Q209LGα11, in sharp contrast to expression of the Gαq and Gαo mutants, had no such effect on CK2 activity. The expression of mutant Gα subunits, which contain internal glutamate-glutamate epitope (EE tagged), was essentially equivalent as determined by immunoblotting of whole-cell lysates by using antibody against EE tag (data not shown). Expression of Q209LGαq or Q205LGαo, but not Q209LGα11, constitutively activated not only CK2 but also Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription as determined with the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 4E). The constitutive activation of Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription observed in response to expression of either the constitutively active Q209LGαq or Q205LGαo mutant was abolished by treatment with the CK2 inhibitor apigenin (Fig. 4E). Constitutive activation of CK2 itself, observed in response to expression of the constitutively active Q209LGαq or Q205LGαo mutants, also was blocked by treatment with apigenin (data not shown). These results demonstrate that Wnt activation of CK2 is mediated by Gαq and Gαo. Role of Dvl-2 in CK2-dependent Activation of Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling—Dvl is a downstream element of the Wnt3a/Frizzled/G protein pathway to activation of Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription (8Katanaev V.L. Ponzielli R. Semeriva M. Tomlinson A. Cell. 2005; 120: 111-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). As observed earlier (14Willert K. Brink M. Wodarz A. Varmus H. Nusse R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 37Song D.H. Sussman D.J. Seldin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23790-23797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), Dvl-2 is phosphorylated in F9 cells stimulated with Wnt3a (Fig. 5A). Treating cells with the CK2 inhibitor DMAT reduced the phosphorylation of Dvl-2 (Fig. 5A) as well as Lef/Tcf-sensitive transcription (Fig. 2D) in response to stimulation by Wnt3a. Overexpression of Dvl was shown to activate the transcription (33Sokol S.Y. Klingensmith J. Perrimon N. Itoh K. Development. 1995; 121: 1637-1647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Itoh K. Brott B.K.

Transient expression of a TAP-tagged Dvl2 activates Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription (Fig. 5B). Knock down of CK2α in F9 cells by siRNA treatment resulted in a sharp decrease in Dvl2-stimulated Lef/Tcf-sensitive transcriptional activation (Fig. 5B), indicating that CK2 is downstream of Dvl and essential for Dvl to activate Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription. Knock down of Dvl-2 expression by siRNA treatment for 24–48 h decreased Dvl-2 >90% (Fig. 5C). The Wnt3a-stimulated CK2 activation was blocked by knocking down Dvl-2 (Fig. 5C). Knock down of Dvl-1, in contrast, had no effect on the ability of Wnt3a to stimulate CK2 activity (Fig. 5D). Thus, Wnt3a activation of CK2 requires Frizzled-1, Gαq/o, and Dvl-2 in a vectorial arrangement. CK2 has been shown to induce dosalization and axis formation in Xenopus embryos, mimicking the effects of XWnt8, Dvl, and β-catenin stimulation, and is hypothesized to play a role in Wnt/β-catenin pathway (20Dominguez I. Mizuno J. Wu H. Song D.H. Symes K. Seldin D.C. Dev. Biol. 2004; 274: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). CK2 can phosphorylate β-catenin at Thr393 in the armadillo repeat region of β-catenin in mammalian cells in vitro, leading to stabilization and accumulation of β-catenin and to co-transcriptional activation of Lef/Tcf-sensitive gene expression (19Song D.H. Dominguez I. Mizuno J. Kaut M. Mohr S.C. Seldin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24018-24025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). How CK2 exerted its role upon Wnt stimulation, however, was insufficiently understood because of its ubiquitous expression and results suggesting CK2 to be “constitutively active”, i.e. an “unregulated” enzyme (11Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Our study is the first report that CK2 activity is regulated acutely in response to stimulation of Wnt3a. We have demonstrated that Wnt stimulates transient activation of CK2 and that the CK2 response is obligate for Wnt-stimulated accumulation of β-catenin and activation of Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription in canonical pathway (Fig. 6). The CK2 activation is mediated by the heterotrimeric G proteins Gq and Go and requires the downstream signaling phosphoprotein Dishevelled-2. Suppression of the expression of CK2α subunits, Gαq or Gαo, or of Dvl2, like chemical inhibition of this kinase, inhibited the activation of CK2 activity as well as β-catenin accumulation and co-activation of transcription in response to Wnt3a stimulation. Whether the change in CK2 activity reflects a change in intrinsic activity or the removal of negative regulators of CK2 activity remains an open question. It has been proposed that β subunit of CK2 confers the substrate specificity (11Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). The α and β subunits of CK2 have been reported to be necessary in tandem to induce dual axis formation in Xenopus (36Dominguez I. Mizuno J. Wu H. Imbrie G.A. Symes K. Seldin D.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 274: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Microinjection of either CK2 subunit alone did not affect axis development (36Dominguez I. Mizuno J. Wu H. Imbrie G.A. Symes K. Seldin D.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 274: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our results from siRNA treatments to specifically knock down CK2 β subunits indicate that these subunits do not regulate CK2 in response to Wnt stimulation. To the contrary, the catalytic α and α′ subunits of CK2 are necessary for transduction of the Wnt signals. We have demonstrated herein that CK2 is, in fact, a regulated enzyme. CK2 activity is activated by stimulation of Frizzled-1, and CK2 is positioned downstream of heterotrimeric G proteins and the phosphoprotein Dishevelled-2 in Wnt/β-catenin signaling. One might anticipate that CK2 may associate with Dishevelleds, which act as molecular “toolboxes” for Wnt signaling. Support for this notion is provided in Wnt-1-expressing mouse mammary epithelial cells, in which CK2 has been found with Dvl in a complex that catalyzes the phosphorylation of β-catenin, making it resistant to proteasomal degradation (37Song D.H. Sussman D.J. Seldin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23790-23797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In Dfz2-expressing Drosophila S2 cells, CK2 also was shown to be associated with Dishevelled (14Willert K. Brink M. Wodarz A. Varmus H. Nusse R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In our study, Dvl-2 is necessary for CK2 activation in response to Wnt3a stimulation in mouse F9 cells. Clearly, how CK2 is activated in response to stimulation by Wnt3a, and the role of Dvl-2 in this regard, will be important questions to be answered.

https://openalex.org/W2059571588,"Visual neurons, from retina to cortex, adapt slowly to stimulus contrast. Following a switch from high to low contrast, a neuron rapidly decreases its responsiveness and recovers over 5–20 s. Cortical adaptation arises from an intrinsic cellular mechanism: a sodium-dependent potassium conductance that causes prolonged hyperpolarization. Spiking can drive this mechanism, raising the possibility that the same mechanism exists in retinal ganglion cells. We found that adaptation in ganglion cells corresponds to a slowly recovering afterhyperpolarization (AHP), but, unlike in cortical cells, this AHP is not primarily driven by an intrinsic cellular property: spiking was not sufficient to generate adaptation. Adaptation was strongest following spatial stimuli tuned to presynaptic bipolar cells rather than the ganglion cell; it was driven by a reduced excitatory conductance, and it persisted while blocking GABA and glycine receptors, K(Ca) channels, or mGluRs. Thus, slow adaptation arises from reduced glutamate release from presynaptic (nonspiking) bipolar cells."
https://openalex.org/W2026581593,"Serpins (serine protease inhibitors) are a large family of structurally related proteins found in a wide variety of organisms, including hematophagous arthropods. Protein analyses revealed that Iris, previously described as an immunomodulator secreted in the tick saliva, is related to the leukocyte elastase inhibitor and possesses serpin motifs, including the reactive center loop (RCL), which is involved in the interaction between serpins and serine proteases. Only serine proteases were inhibited by purified recombinant Iris (rIris), whereas mutants L339A and A332P were found devoid of any protease inhibitory activity. The highest Ka was observed with human leukocyte-elastase, suggesting that elastase-like proteases are the natural targets of Iris. In addition, mutation M340R completely changed both Iris substrate specificity and affinity. This likely identified Met-340 as amino acid P1 in the RCL. The effects of rIris and its mutants were also tested on primary hemostasis, blood clotting, and fibrinolysis. rIris increased platelet adhesion, the contact phase-activated pathway of coagulation, and fibrinolysis times in a dose-dependent manner, whereas rIris mutant L339A affected only platelet adhesion. Taken together, these results indicate that Iris disrupts coagulation and fibrinolysis via the anti-proteolytic RCL domain. One or more other domains could be responsible for primary hemostasis inhibition. To our knowledge, this is the first ectoparasite serpin that interferes with both hemostasis and the immune response.

Ticks are blood-sucking arthropods that infest a large variety of vertebrate hosts (mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians) in many parts of the world (1Sauer J.R. McSwain J.L. Bowman A.S. Essenberg R.C. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1995; 40: 245-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To complete their blood meal, blood-sucking arthropods express a wide range of anti-hemostatic molecules in their saliva, including vasodilators, inhibitors of the platelet aggregation, and anti-coagulants (2Champagne D.E. Curr. Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 375-396Google Scholar). Tick saliva and salivary gland extracts are also known to modulate the host's defense mechanisms (3Ribeiro J.M.

These compounds include histamine-binding proteins, tissue factor pathway inhibitor-like proteins, anti-thrombin-like proteins, and anti-complement factors (7Hoffmann A. Walsmann P. Riesener G.

These last years, several laboratories reported the construction and screening of cDNA libraries from tick salivary glands. Thus, Das et al. (17Das S. Banerjee G. DePonte K. Marcantonio N. Kantor F.S. Fikrig E. J. Infect. Dis. 2001; 184: 1056-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) found 14 Ixodes scapularis immunodominant antigens, whereas Leboulle et al. (18Leboulle G.

Finally, Ribeiro and co-workers explored the sialome of the tick I. scapularis (19Valenzuela J.G. Francischetti I.M. Pham V.M. Garfield M.K. Mather T.N. Ribeiro J.M. J. Exp.

These studies all identified some serine protease inhibitors, containing serpin, kunitz, kazal, or α-macroglobulin motifs (21Kanost M.R. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1999; 23: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). To date, ∼500 serpins have been identified in a large variety of species, including animals, viruses, and plants. On average, serpins are 350-400 amino acids long. In human plasma, they make up ∼2% of the total protein amount, of which 70% is α-1-antitrypsin. Both extracellular and intracellular serpins have been identified (22Van Gent D. Sharp P. Morgan K. Kalsheker N. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1536-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Members of the superfamily of serine protease inhibitors are expressed in a cell-specific manner and are involved in a number of fundamental biological processes such as blood coagulation, complement activation, fibrinolysis, angiogenesis, inflammation, and tumor suppression (23Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar, 24Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. Semin. Thromb.

The protein structure of serpins is usually characterized by three β-sheets (A, B, and C) and eight or nine α-helices (26Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G. Irving J.A. Lomas D.A. Luke C.J. Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Salvesen G.S. Travis J. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol.

A typical feature of serpins is the reactive center loop (RCL), 3The abbreviations used are: RCL, reactive center loop; HLE, human leukocyte elastase; Iris, I. ricinus immunosuppressor; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor, type 1; PDB, Protein Data Bank; PPE, pancreatic porcine elastase; RBD, rIris, recombinant Iris; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; t-PA, tissue plasminogen activator; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; ECLT, euglobulin clot lysis time; ANOVA, analysis of variance; MMP, metalloprotease; PFA, platelet function analyzer.3The abbreviations used are: RCL, reactive center loop; HLE, human leukocyte elastase; Iris, I. ricinus immunosuppressor; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor, type 1; PDB, Protein Data Bank; PPE, pancreatic porcine elastase; RBD, rIris, recombinant Iris; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; t-PA, tissue plasminogen activator; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; ECLT, euglobulin clot lysis time; ANOVA, analysis of variance; MMP, metalloprotease; PFA, platelet function analyzer. a protein motif composed of ∼20 amino acids, located near the C terminus of the protein. This motif contains a scissile bond between residues called P1 and P1′, which is cleaved by the target protease. Once cleaved, the RCL domain traps the protease and moves to the opposite pole of the serpin through the β-sheet A. This tight association results in an irreversible loss of structure and distortion of both the protease and the serpin. Inside the RCL domain the hinge region (amino acids P15-P9) is implicated in the stabilization of the interaction with the protease and provides mobility for the integration of the RCL in β-sheet A. Some serpin family members, while structurally similar to inhibitor serpins, have no inhibitory functions. These non-inhibitory serpins include corticosteroid binding globulin and thyroxine binding globulin, which are involved in hormone transport, angiotensinogen, which is a peptide hormone precursor, and ovalbumin. These serpins retain the mobility of the RCL domain. However, there is no evidence for a conformational change following cleavage at their putative reactive centers. A few serpins have been recently isolated from the hard ticks Amblyomma hebraeum, Amblyomma variegatum, Boophilus microplus, Hemaphysalis longicornis, I. scapularis, and Rhipicephalus appendiculatus (27Imamura S. da Silva Vaz Junior I.

Most of them have been proposed as targets in an anti-tick mixture vaccine (30Sugino M. Imamura S. Mulenga A. Nakajima M. Tsuda A. Ohashi K. Onuma M.

Recently, we have characterized a protein, which is up-regulated during the blood meal and modulates both the innate and acquired immunity of the host (35Leboulle G. Crippa M. Decrem Y. Mejri N. Brossard M. Bollen A. Godfroid E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10083-10089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we named the protein Iris for “I. ricinus immunosuppressor.” Iris was also found to be related to the pig leukocyte elastase inhibitor (35Leboulle G. Crippa M. Decrem Y. Mejri N. Brossard M. Bollen A. Godfroid E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10083-10089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In this report, we present the cloning and the expression of Iris as well as single point mutants in insect cells. Structural analysis and directed mutagenesis confirmed that Iris is a serpin with Met-340 as the P1 residue. We also show that Iris is a specific elastase inhibitor that interferes with the coagulation pathways and the fibrinolysis process via the RCL domain. Finally, we show that Iris inhibits platelet adhesion via another functional domain. To our knowledge, this is the first ectoparasite serpin that alters both hemostasis and the immune response. Plasmid Construction, Protein Expression, and Purification—The coding sequence for Iris (formerly Seq24; accession number AJ269658) was subcloned from vector pCDNA3.1-V5-His/Iris (35Leboulle G. Crippa M. Decrem Y. Mejri N. Brossard M. Bollen A. Godfroid E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10083-10089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) between the KpnI/AgeI restriction sites of vector pBlueBac4.5-V5-His (Invitrogen) in-frame with the coding sequence of the V5 and His epitopes at the C terminus. Recombinant baculoviruses were made by recombination between pBlueBac/Iris and Bac-N-Blue linear DNA virus (Invitrogen). Recombinant viruses were selected and amplified according to the manufacturer's instruction. SF9 cells were infected with a high titer stock of recombinant baculovirus and were incubated for 55 h at 27 °C. Cells were then lysed using the French press, and spun at 106 × g for 40 min. The recombinant protein was further purified in one step from the cleared supernatant by chelating chromatography over Ni2+-Sepharose (Qiagen). Recombinant Iris was eluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 500 mm NaCl and 150 mm imidazole. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Typically, 50 mg of purified rIris was obtained per liter of suspension culture. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Iris in pBlueBac4.5 V5 His—Mutants were produce by using the QuikChange PCR mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following PCR primers were used to generate P9, P2, and P1 mutants, respectively: 5′-GCA CAG AGG CTG CAG CTC CCA CTG CCA TAC CC-3′ (forward A332P), 5′-GGG TAT GGC AGT GGG AGC TGC AGC CTC TGT GC-3′ (reverse A332P); 5′-GCC ATA CCC ATT ATG GCG ATG TGC GCG AGA TTT CC-3′ (forward L339A), 5′-GGA AAT CTC GCG CAC ATC GCC ATA ATG GGT ATG GC-3′ (reverse L339A); 5′-GCC ATA CCC ATT ATG TTG CGG TGC GCG AGA TTT CC-3′ (forward M340R), 5′-GGA AAT CTC GCG CAC CGC AAC ATA ATG GGT ATG GC-3′ (reverse M340R); where the underlined nucleotides generate the mutation. Supercompetent XL1-Blue cells were transformed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the plasmids were purified to confirm the sequence modifications by sequencing. Molecular Modeling—Three-dimensional models of Iris were generated using the homology modeling software Modeler 6.2 (36Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10456) Google Scholar). To construct a model, the sequence of Iris was aligned to a homologous sequence whose three-dimensional structure had been experimentally determined. For that purpose, the Protein Data Bank (PDB) was screened using the Blast algorithm. α-Antitrypsin (PDB code: 1ATU) was selected as the template for the native model and horse leukocyte elastase inhibitor (PDB code: 1HLE) for the cleaved model. The percentages of identity with Iris are 32 and 42%, respectively, and the percentages of similarity 51 and 59%, respectively. To further examine the homology, the hydrophobic cluster analysis plots of both sequences were compared. Briefly, the hydrophobic cluster analysis method is based on a two-dimensional helical plot of the sequence and allows detection of hydrophobic clusters in proteins (37Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Benchetrit T. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The stereochemical quality of the minimized three-dimensional model was assessed using Procheck (38Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Both models had no residues located in the disallowed regions of the Φ, Ψ angle pairs of the Ramachandran plot, indicating correct stereochemistry. Molecular views were drawn with WinMGM (39Rahman M. Brasseur R. J. Mol. Graph. 1994; 12: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A model of the interaction between Iris and a protease was built using Swissmodel (40Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3391-3395Crossref Scopus (4448) Google Scholar). The template was the complex between trypsin and alaserpin A353K (PDB code: 1K9O). The Pex algorithm was used to analyze the residues in this interaction. This method extracts numeric and string descriptions of protein structures from PDB files and lists parameters such as the dihedral angles, the N-H bond lengths, the secondary structure, the closest residues in the interaction, and the minimal distance of the interaction (41Thomas A. Bouffioux O. Geeurickx D. Brasseur R. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 43: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Enzymatic Assays—To assay the inhibition of proteases, Iris was mixed in a microcuvette with 5-20 μl of a protease at an equimolecular ratio in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl. Residual activity was measured by adding 1 ml of 0.5 mm of an appropriate chromogenic substrate in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl. The increase in absorbance at 405 nm over time was measured. Two variants of the assay were performed: (i) in a first, residual activity was measured after incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, (ii) in a second, activity was measured as function of the incubation time. In the former case, residual activity in the presence of ovalbumin, which is a serpin with no inhibitory activity, was taken as the 100% reference point. rIris was tested in the presence of the following subset of enzyme-substrate systems: human thrombin and N-benzoyl-Phe-Val-Arg-p-Na; human leukocyte elastase (HLE) and N-(methoxysuccinyl)-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-p-Na; porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE, Roche Applied Science), and N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-p-Na; human plasmin and N-p-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-p-Na; human factor Xa and factor Xa chromogenic substrate; recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA, Hyphen Biomed, France) and t-PA chromogenic substrate; and human trypsin and N-benzoyl-Phe-Val-Arg-p-Na. We also tested two cysteine proteases (papain with pGlu-Phe-Leu-p-Na and caspase 3 with N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-Na) and one human metalloelastase (MMP12 with MMP chromogenic substrate, Biomol). All products were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise indicated. Measurement of Association Rate Constants—The association rate constant (ka) describes the inhibition kinetics of free serine proteases by serpins. It was determined by mixing proteases and rIris for variable periods of time before addition of the substrate (0.5 mm), which slows down the association process enough to allow measurement of residual enzyme activity (42Frommherz K.J. Faller B. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15356-15362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering that the dissociation reaction is slow with respect to the interval of time needed to follow association, the rate association, -d[E]/dt is given by Equation 1 (42Frommherz K.J. Faller B. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15356-15362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).-d[E]dt=ka·[E][I](Eq. 1) The rate of association was either under second order conditions ([E]0 = [I]0) or pseudo-first order conditions ([I]0 > 10[E]0). In the former case, non-linear regression analysis was used to fit the data to the following second-order equation,[E]=[E]0(1+[E]0·ka·t) where E is the concentration of free enzyme at any time, t, and E0 is the concentration at t = 0. E0 and E are proportional to the rate of substrate hydrolysis at t = 0 and at any time, respectively. When pseudo-first order rate constants were used, the data were fitted to the following exponential equation,[E]=[E]0·e-ka·[I]0·t where I0 is the I concentration at t = 0. Clotting Assays—The tests were performed on a pool of citrated platelet-poor human plasma from six healthy, fully informed, and consenting adult volunteers. Aliquots were stored at -80 °C until analysis. Recombinant Iris was dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline devoid of Ca2+ and Mg2+. The effects of 1.5-6 μm rIris on coagulation time were evaluated on BCT machine (Dade, Behring). Phospholipids and activators (Innovin 1/200 for tissue factor, PTT 1/4 for contact phase activation) were added to 50 μl of spiked plasma. Clotting time was recorded after the addition of 50 μl of 25 mm CalCl2. Cell-based clotting time assays were performed by adding 6 μm rIris to a mixture of human plasma and the human monocytes THP1 (106 cells/ml final). The mix was then incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Clotting times were measured after addition of 100 μl of 25 mm CaCl2. Euglobulin Clot Lysis Time—The euglobulin fraction was prepared as described by Zouaoui Boudjeltia et al. (43Zouaoui Boudjeltia K. Cauchie P. Remacle C. Guillaume M. Brohee D. Hubert J.L. Vanhaeverbeek M. BMC Biotech. 2002; 2: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, 300 μl of acetic acid (0.025%) and 3.6 ml of deionized water were added to 400 μl of pooled human plasma. The sample was centrifuged at 4.0 × 103 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing increasing concentrations of rIris, with or without added neutrophils (final concentration 5 × 106 per ml). Clot formation was started by adding 100 μl (1.5 units/ml) of thrombin. ECLT was measured by a semi-automatic method using a “Lysis Timer” device (43Zouaoui Boudjeltia K. Cauchie P. Remacle C. Guillaume M. Brohee D. Hubert J.L. Vanhaeverbeek M. BMC Biotech. 2002; 2: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, another test was performed to exclude the effects of the interaction of Iris on the cell surface. Cells were incubated with rIris for 1 h and then washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. Washed cells were then resuspended in HBSS before use in the ECLT test. Primary Hemostasis—Blood samples were collected from five healthy, fully informed, and consenting volunteers in 0.13 m citrate vacuum tubes. Global platelet function was measured on PFA-100® machine (Dade, Behring) with the collagen/epinephrine cartridge. This apparatus creates an artificial vessel consisting of a bioactive membrane with a microscopic aperture (44Kundu S.K. Heilmann E.J. Sio R. Garcia C. Davidson R.M. Ostgaard R.A. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1995; 21: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The sample (1/10 protein in HBSS and 9/10 anti-coagulated whole blood) was aspirated through a capillary under steady high shear rates (5000-6000 s-1) within 2 h of sample collection. The presence of the platelet agonist and the high shear rates result in a platelet plug that gradually occludes the aperture. The closure time is considered to be the time required to obtain full occlusion of the aperture. Statistical Analyses—SigmaStat® software (Jandel Scientific, Erkrath, Germany) was used for the analysis. Data are represented as mean ± S.D. and were evaluated by one-way ANOVA. The effect of rIris on platelet adhesion was evaluated by a Friedman repeated measures analysis of variance on ranks test. Molecular Modeling—Iris had previously been found to be similar to the pig leukocyte elastase inhibitor (35Leboulle G. Crippa M. Decrem Y. Mejri N. Brossard M. Bollen A. Godfroid E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10083-10089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, membership in the serpin superfamily was confirmed by the high conservation of consensus residues identified by Irving and colleagues (45Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Lesk A.M. Whisstock J.C. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1845-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). All conserved residues among serpins are also conserved in Iris except for the replacement of Phe-106 by Tyr, Ile-134 by Val, Gly-144 by Ser, Leu-288 by Met, and Pro-377 by Leu. Alignment of hydrophobic clusters also supported homologous folds (data not shown). Therefore, we sought to build a three-dimensional model of the entire protein based on the homology (Fig. 1) using Modeler (36Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10456) Google Scholar). To find an accurate template, PDB was searched using the Blast algorithm. Horse leukocyte elastase inhibitor and α-antitrypsin both displaying over 30% identity with Iris (Fig. 2) were chosen as templates for the models corresponding to the cleaved state and uncleaved state, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). Models were tested with Procheck, and all the residues were in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot.FIGURE 2Alignment of Iris with α-antitrypsin and horse leukocyte elastase inhibitor. Amino acid sequence alignment between α-antitrypsin (PDB code: 1ATU) from residue 46 to 418, Iris from residue 1 to 377, and horse leukocyte elastase inhibitor (PDB code: 1HLE) from residue 1 to 344. This alignment was obtained using the ClustalW algorithm. Dots indicate similar amino acids, and stars indicate identical amino acids. Indents indicate gaps. Conserved domains are boxed. The open boxes indicate the position of the RCL domain and the highly conserved serpin residues (s3a domain). The shaded box stands for the serpin signature (Prosite code: PS00284) in Iris.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between the uncleaved model (Fig. 1A) and its template is 0.44 Å (on 363 Cα). In contrast, the calculated r.m.s.d. between ovalbumin and α-antitrypsin is 1.57 Å. We also compared the predicted RCL of Iris with the corresponding amino acid sequence of inhibitory and non-inhibitory serpins (Fig. 3). The RCL from Iris was aligned to the consensus RCL from inhibitory serpins (46Hopkins P.C. Carrell R.W. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7650-7657Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), among these Glu-324, Gly-325, Thr-326, Ala-328, and Ala-332 were perfectly conserved. All conserved amino acids essential for the inhibitory function were present in Iris (Fig. 2). This alignment suggested that Iris has an inhibitory function based on the presence of methionine 340 adjacent to the cleavage site (position P1). We further modeled and analyzed the interactions of Iris with trypsin to find the residues that make contact with the protease (Fig. 1C). The complex between trypsin and alaserpin (PDB code: 1K9O) was used as a template for this model. The r.m.s.d. between alaserpin and Iris is 0.22 Å. Using the Pex algorithm, we determined the residues involved in the interaction. Most of the important residues were located in the RCL, some specifically in the Hinge region (Fig. 3). rIris Expression and Purification—The coding sequence of Iris was cloned in the vector pBlueBac4.5-V5-His (Invitrogen) in-frame with the V5-His tag, expressed in a baculovirus system and purified to homogeneity as confirmed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Affinity-purified rIris migrated at an apparent mass of 48 kDa on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (data not shown). This contrasted with an expected molecular weight of 44 kDa and suggested putative posttranslational modifications. Inhibition of Protease Activity by rIris—We tested the ability of purified rIris to inhibit various serine proteases derived from human blood (leukocyte elastase, t-PA, factor Xa, plasmin, thrombin, and trypsin) or from porcine pancreas (pancreatic elastase), as well as two human cysteine proteases (caspase-3 and papain), and one human metalloelastase (MMP12). Recombinant Iris was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the various proteases, and the residual proteolytic activity was measured using synthetic chromogenic substrates. Most of the serine proteases were inhibited by rIris, as opposed to the two cysteine proteases and the metalloelastase, which did not show any significant drop of activity in presence of rIris (Table 1). From these data, the serine proteases could be distributed into three groups: (i) human leukocyte elastase and porcine pancreas elastase with a residual activity of ∼30%; (ii) thrombin, t-PA, and factor Xa with a residual activity near 70%; and (iii) plasmin with 100% residual activity (no inhibitory effect of rIris).TABLE 1Affinity constants and inhibition rate of proteases by rIris and its mutants Proteases were incubated at an equimolar ratio with rIris or its mutants for 1 h at 37 °C. Residual activity in the presence of ovalbumin, a serpin with no inhibitory activity, is used as the 100% reference point (see “Materials and Methods”). The mutants A332P and L339A were not tested o"
https://openalex.org/W2069479107,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional protein type 2 was recently identified as an authentic substrate of the ubiquitin E3 ligase, parkin, a gene associated with autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism. Far upstream element-binding protein 1 is known to be degraded in an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase interacting multifunctional protein type 2 dependent manner, which is crucial for lung cell maturation in early development. Therefore, we wondered whether far upstream element-binding protein 1 levels are altered in the absence of Parkin and in Parkinson disease.

Parkinson disease (PD) 4The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson disease; AR-JP, autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism; DLB, diffuse Lewy body; MPTP, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein. is the second most common neurodegenerative disease affecting about one percent of the elderly population above the age of 65 (1Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2003; 302: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra leads to the major motor symptoms of PD including rest tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Recent genetic advances have provided important clues to understanding the pathogenesis of PD. Several genes are now linked to familial PD including parkin, DJ-1, PINK-1, LRRK2, and α-synuclein (2Moore D.J. West A.B. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 57-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Mutations in Parkin are the most common cause of autosomal recessive familial Parkinson disease (3von Coelln R. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Cell Tissue Res. 2004; 318: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). parkin encodes a ubiquitin E3 ligase that plays important roles in maintaining protein homeostasis by targeting its substrates to the ubiquitin proteasome system. We and others previously showed that aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional protein type 2 (AIMP2) (also called p38/JTV1) is a potential Parkin substrate (4Corti O. Hampe C. Koutnikova H. Darios F. Jacquier S. Prigent A. Robinson J.C. Pradier L. Ruberg M. Mirande M. Hirsch E. Rooney T. Fournier A. Brice A. Hum. Mol.

Kim S. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7968-7978Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Moreover, AIMP2 appears to be an authentic substrate of Parkin (5Ko H.S. von Coelln R. Sriram S.R. Kim S.W. Chung K.K. Pletnikova O. Troncoso J. Johnson B. Saffary R. Goh E.L. Song H. Park B.J. Kim M.J. Kim S. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7968-7978Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) as it is selectively increased in the brains of Parkin–/– mice and brains of human patients with autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP) due to mutations in parkin, unlike other putative substrates of Parkin (5Ko H.S. von Coelln R. Sriram S.R. Kim S.W. Chung K.K. Pletnikova O. Troncoso J. Johnson B. Saffary R. Goh E.L. Song H. Park B.J. Kim M.J. Kim S. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7968-7978Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In addition, AIMP2 accumulates in sporadic PD patient brains due to S-nitrosylation of Parkin, which inhibits its ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. Thus, selective up-regulation of AIMP2 may play an important and crucial role in the development of PD due to its accumulation in both sporadic PD and AR-JP. Since AIMP2 is known to interact with and promotes the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of the far upstream element (FUSE)-binding protein 1 (FBP1), we assessed whether FBP1 protein levels are altered in PD. In this report, we demonstrate that FBP1 is up-regulated in Parkin–/– mice, AR-JP, sporadic PD, diffuse Lewy body (DLB) disease, and the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. Moreover, Parkin binds and ubiquitinates FBP1 enhancing its degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome system. Thus, FBP1 is the second authentic Parkin substrate identified to date. cDNA, Cell Culture, and Antibodies—Full-length hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human FBP1 and GFP-tagged human FBP1 cDNAs were kindly provided by David Levens (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Human full-length Parkin and ubiquitin cDNAs were cloned into PRK5-myc and pRK5-HA vectors, respectively. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). SH-SY5Y cells were transiently transfected with the target vector using the Lipofectamine plus (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer's instruction. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as reported previously (5Ko H.S. von Coelln R. Sriram S.R. Kim S.W. Chung K.K. Pletnikova O. Troncoso J. Johnson B. Saffary R. Goh E.L. Song H. Park B.J. Kim M.J. Kim S. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7968-7978Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h after SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with 2 μg of each plasmid, cells were harvested and sonicated in lysis buffer. After centrifugal separation, 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) preincubated with antibodies against GFP (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) or myc (Roche Applied Science) was added to the supernatants. The precipitate with protein G-Sepharose was pelleted and resolved by SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—For in vivo ubiquitination assays, SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of pRK5-myc-tagged Parkin or myc-tagged Parkin mutants, pCMV-GFP-FBP1, and 1.5 μg of pMT123-HA-ubiquitin for 48 h. Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation conducted according to the method described previously (5Ko H.S. von Coelln R. Sriram S.R. Kim S.W. Chung K.K. Pletnikova O. Troncoso J.

The antibodies used were anti-HA and anti-GFP. Animals and MPTP Injections—All procedures involving animals were approved by and conformed to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care Committee of Johns Hopkins University. 8-Week-old male C57/bl mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) (n = 5 per group) received four intraperitoneal injections of MPTP-HCl (20 mg/kg free base, Research Biochemicals) in saline or saline alone at 2-h intervals. Animals were decapitated 2, 4, 24, 48, and 96 h and 7 days after the last MPTP injection, and their ventral midbrain and striata were quickly dissected out and processed for Western blot analysis. Human Tissues—Human brain tissue was obtained through the brain donation program of the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Disease Research Center at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations. Preparation of Human and Mouse Brain Tissue—Frontal caudate (n = 3) and cingulate (n = 2) tissues from control brains and eight PD and DLB brains with high Lewy body burden (Table 1) were used to analyze Parkin substrates in PD and DLB brains. AR-JP brains described previously (6Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4183) Google Scholar) were used to compare Parkin substrate levels. Parkin–/– mice were generated as originally described (7Von Coelln R. Thomas B. Savitt J.M. Lim K.L. Sasaki M. Hess E.J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10744-10749Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions were separated from the brain homogenates. The homogenization procedure was accomplished in accordance with published methods (5Ko H.S. von Coelln R.

Actin was used as a loading control. We observed a significant increase in levels of FBP1 in the brain stem (Fig. 1A) and cortex (Fig. 1B) compared with wild type controls. We failed to observed a significant up-regulation of FBP1 as assessed by Western blot analysis and quantification in the ventral midbrain, cerebellum, and striatum (Fig. 1C). FBP1 Accumulates in Human AR-JP, PD, and DLB Samples and MPTP-treated Mice—To ascertain whether the up-regulation of FBP1 in Parkin–/– mice has pathophysiological relevance, Western blot analysis was performed on lysates from cortex of patient with AR-JP and age-matched controls. A 14% increase in FBP1 levels was detected in AR-JP brains when compared with controls in the soluble fraction, and we observed a 3-fold increase in FBP1 levels in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 2A). Recent observations suggest that S-nitrosylation of Parkin inhibits its ubiquitin E3 ligase activity, which could lead to accumulation of Parkin substrates in PD and DLB brains (8Chung K.K. Thomas B. Li X. Pletnikova O. Troncoso J.C. Marsh L. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Science. 2004; 304: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we assessed the levels of FBP1 in sporadic PD and DLB. A more than 9-fold increase in FBP1 was observed in PD/DLB brains compared with controls (Fig. 2B). Previously, we had shown that MPTP leads to the S-nitrosylation of Parkin in a biphasic manner (8Chung K.K. Thomas B. Li X. Pletnikova O. Troncoso J.C. Marsh L. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Science. 2004; 304: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Mice were injected with MPTP (20 mg/kg body weight) every 2 h for a total of 4 doses. This regimen causes a reduction of more than 90% of striatal dopamine and its metabolites and a loss of dopamine neurons (9Mandir A.S. Przedborski S. Jackson-Lewis V. Wang Z.Q. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Smulson M.E. Hoffman B.E. Guastella D.B. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5774-5779Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, we found that FBP1 was up-regulated in a biphasic manner at 2 h and 48 h post-MPTP treatment similar to the S-nitrosylation of Parkin (8Chung K.K. Thomas B. Li X. Pletnikova O. Troncoso J.C. Marsh L. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Science. 2004; 304: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The up-regulation was sustained until about 7 days post-MPTP injection (Fig. 2C). Parkin Interacts with and Ubiquitinates FBP1 Leading to Its Degradation—The accumulation of FBP1 in Parkin–/– brain stem and cortex, AR-JP brains, PD/DLB brains, and MPTP-treated mice prompted us to determine whether Parkin interacts with, ubiquitinates, and degrades FBP1. Co-transfection experiments with myc-tagged Parkin and GFP-tagged FBP1 using human SH-SY5Y cells were performed followed by immunoprecipitation using anti-GFP antibody. Parkin co-immunoprecipitates with FBP1 (Fig. 3A). Next, SH-SY5Y cells were co-transfected with GFP-tagged FBP1, myc-tagged Parkin as well as HA-tagged ubiquitin, and total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP antibody. Increased anti-HA immunoreactivity in the form of a high molecular weight smear characteristic of polyubiquitinated protein on GFP-FBP1 in the presence of wild type Parkin indicates that Parkin ubiquitinates FBP1 (Fig. 3B). The failure of the familially linked T240R mutant Parkin to affect Parkin-mediated ubiquitination of GFP-FBP1 indicates that the ubiquitination of GFP-FBP1 is specific to wild type Parkin. We next evaluated whether the ubiquitination of Parkin of FBP1 facilitates its degradation by the 26 S proteasome. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with cyclohexamide (100 μg/ml) with or without Parkin. Total cell lysates were obtained at various time points after cyclohexamide treatment, and endogenous FBP1 levels were assessed and compared with actin. The decrease in the steady-state levels of FBP1 was accelerated in the presence of wild type Parkin compared with cells transfected with empty myc vector or familially linked T240R mutant Parkin (Fig. 3C). Taken together these results indicate that Parkin binds to FBP1 and targets it for proteasomal degradation through ubiquitination. The major finding of the current study is that FBP1 is an authentic Parkin substrate. FBP1 interacts with Parkin via co-immunoprecipitation, and this interaction leads to its ubiquitination, which is impaired by the catalytically inactive T240R familially associated mutant. Overexpression of wild type Parkin, but not T240R mutant Parkin, accelerates the degradation of FBP1. Although, we were not able to directly show that Parkin interacts with and ubiquitinates FBP1, the accumulation of FBP1 in Parkin–/– brains and AR-JP brains that are deficient in Parkin supports the notion that FBP1 is an authentic Parkin substrate. Moreover, the up-regulation of FBP1 in MPTP-treated mice and in patients with PD or DLB, which have inactivated Parkin due to S-nitrosylation is consistent with the idea that FBP1 may be an authentic Parkin substrate. The identification of both FBP1 and AIMP2 as authentic Parkin substrates provides additional potential insight into the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease due to the absence or inactivation of Parkin function. FBP1 and AIMP2 are likely to function in a common pathogenic pathway as they are interacting proteins and AIMP2 promotes the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of FBP1 through an as yet unidentified ubiquitin E3 ligase (10Kim M.J. Park B.J. Kang Y.S. Kim H.J. Park J.H. Kang J.W. Lee S.W. Han J.M. Lee H.W. Kim S. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Since Parkin interacts with and ubiquitinates both AIMP2 and FBP1, it is conceivable that it is the E3 ligase that mediates AIMP2-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of FBP1. Thus, the absence of Parkin potentially removes a negative feed back loop that controls FBP1 levels when AIMP2 levels are elevated. This coupled with the observation that FBP1 up-regulates AIMP2 (10Kim M.J. Park B.J. Kang Y.S. Kim H.J. Park J.H. Kang J.W. Lee S.W. Han J.M. Lee H.W. Kim S. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) could set in motion a feed forward mechanism, leading to the sustained up-regulation of AIMP2 and FBP1 in the absence of Parkin, which seems to be an essential E3 ligase for both proteins. Preliminary results suggest that increased level of FBP1 itself is not toxic (data not shown), but AIMP2 is selectively toxic to dopaminergic neurons (5Ko H.S. von Coelln R. Sriram S.R. Kim S.W. Chung K.K. Pletnikova O. Troncoso J. Johnson B. Saffary R. Goh E.L. Song H. Park B.J. Kim M.J. Kim S. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7968-7978Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thus, the up-regulation of FBP1 and AIMP2 could contribute to a progressive degenerative loss of dopaminergic neurons due to Parkin deficiency in AR-JP or Parkin inactivation in sporadic PD.

XLαs is only expressed from the paternal allele, whereas Gsα is biallelically expressed in most tissues. XLαs knock-out mice (Gnasxlm+/p–) have poor suckling and perinatal lethality, implicating XLαs as critical for postnatal feeding. We have now examined the metabolic phenotype of adult Gnasxlm+/p– mice. Gnasxlm+/p– mice had reduced fat mass and lipid accumulation in adipose tissue, with increased food intake and metabolic rates. Gene expression profiling was consistent with increased lipid metabolism in adipose tissue. These changes likely result from increased sympathetic nervous system activity rather than adipose cell-autonomous effects, as we found that XLαs is not normally expressed in adult adipose tissue, and Gnasxlm+/p– mice had increased urinary norepinephrine levels but not increased metabolic responsiveness to a β3-adrenergic agonist. Gnasxlm+/p– mice were hypolipidemic and had increased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. The similar metabolic profile observed in some prior paternal Gnas knock-out models results from XLαs deficiency (or deficiency of the related alternative truncated protein XLN1). XLαs (or XLN1) is a negative regulator of sympathetic nervous system activity in mice. The complex imprinted Gnas locus encodes several gene products including Gsα, the ubiquitously expressed G protein α-subunit required for receptor-stimulated cAMP generation, and the neuroendocrine-specific Gsα isoform XLαs. XLαs is only expressed from the paternal allele, whereas Gsα is biallelically expressed in most tissues.

XLαs (or XLN1) is a negative regulator of sympathetic nervous system activity in mice. The incidence of both obesity and diabetes has markedly increased over the past two decades. A basic understanding of the regulation of energy and glucose metabolism is required for the identification of potential new therapeutic targets. One gene shown to be important for metabolic regulation is GNAS on chromosome 20q13 in humans (Gnas on chromosome 2 in mice) (1Weinstein L.S. Liu J. Sakamoto A. Xie T. Chen M.

GNAS/Gnas encodes several protein products, including the ubiquitously expressed G protein α-subunit Gsα 2The abbreviations used are: Gsα, stimulatory G protein a subunit; BAT and WAT, brown and white adipose tissue, respectively; XLαs, extra-large Gsα isoform; XLN1, alternative transcript from Gnasxl promoter; NESP55, 55-kDa neuroendocrine-specific protein; FFA, free fatty acids; PPAR, peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor; Ab, antibody; RT, reverse transcription. 2The abbreviations used are: Gsα, stimulatory G protein a subunit; BAT and WAT, brown and white adipose tissue, respectively; XLαs, extra-large Gsα isoform; XLN1, alternative transcript from Gnasxl promoter; NESP55, 55-kDa neuroendocrine-specific protein; FFA, free fatty acids; PPAR, peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor; Ab, antibody; RT, reverse transcription. that couples receptors to cAMP generation, the alternative Gsα isoform XLαs, and the 55-kDa neuroendrocrine-specific secretory protein (NESP55). Heterozygous mutations resulting in partial Gsα deficiency lead to obesity in mice (3Chen M. Gavrilova O. Liu J. Xie T. Deng C. Nguyen A.T. Nackers L.M. Lorenzo J. Shen L. Weinstein L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7386-7391Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and in patients with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (1Weinstein L.S. Liu J. Sakamoto A. Xie T. Chen M.

GNAS/Gnas is a complex imprinted gene whose major gene products are generated by alternative promoters and first exons that splice onto a common exon (exon 2) (1Weinstein L.S. Liu J. Sakamoto A. Xie T. Chen M. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5459-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 2Weinstein L.S. Yu S. Warner D.R. Liu J. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). NESP55 and XLαs are expressed from oppositely imprinted Nesp and Gnasxl promoters; NESP55 is only expressed from the maternal allele, whereas XLαs is only expressed from the paternal allele. In contrast, the Gsα promoter is imprinted in a tissue-specific manner, with Gsα being biallelically expressed in most tissues but primarily expressed from the maternal allele in a small number of tissues. XLαs is structurally identical to Gsα except for a long amino-terminal extension encoded within its specific first exon (4Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 5Li T. Vu T.H. Zeng Z.L. Nguyen B.T. Hayward B.E. Bonthron D.T. Hu J.F. Hoffman A.R. Genomics. 2000; 69: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast to Gsα, which is ubiquitously expressed at high levels in virtually all tissues, XLαs has a more restricted tissue distribution with expression primarily limited to neuroendocrine tissues (4Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 6Pasolli H.A. Klemke M. Kehlenbach R.H. Wang Y. Huttner W.B. J. Biol.

Dean W. Boiani R. Cinti S. Peters J. Kelsey G. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In vitro biochemical studies have shown that XLαs is capable of stimulating adenylyl cyclase (8Klemke M. Pasolli H.A. Kehlenbach R.H. Offermanns S. Schultz G. Huttner W.B. J. Biol.

Jüppner H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1912-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), although its role in vivo is less clear. The XLαs promoter also generates a neural-specific truncated form of XLαs (XLN1) produced by splicing of exon 3 onto an alternative terminal exon (6Pasolli H.A. Klemke M. Kehlenbach R.H. Wang Y. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33622-33632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Whether the resultant truncated protein has any biological function or whether it can act as a dominant negative inhibitor of Gsα or XLαs signaling is unknown. NESP55 does not appear to be an important metabolic regulator in either humans (10Liu J. Litman D. Rosenberg M.J. Yu S. Biesecker L.G. Weinstein L.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) or mice (11Plagge A. Isles A.R. Gordon E. Humby T. Dean W. Gritsch S. Fischer-Colbrie R. Wilkinson L.S. Kelsey G. Mol. Cell.

Those that survived had markedly reduced adiposity, increased metabolic rate, and activity levels and greater than normal glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (13Yu S. Castle A. Chen M. Lee R.

E2m+/p– mice had increased urinary norepinephrine excretion, suggesting that these metabolic effects may be the consequence of increased sympathetic nervous system activity (14Yu S. Gavrilova O.

In contrast, E1m+/p– mice with paternal deletion of Gsα exon 1 leading only to partial Gsα deficiency had normal suckling and survival and developed obesity, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance (3Chen M. Gavrilova O. Liu J. Xie T. Deng C. Nguyen A.T. Nackers L.M. Lorenzo J. Shen L. Weinstein L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7386-7391Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Comparison of E2m+/p– and E1m+/p– mice indirectly implicates XLαs as an important regulator of postnatal feeding as well as energy and glucose metabolism in older animals and suggests that XLαs and Gsα may have opposite effects on metabolic regulation in the whole animal. We have recently generated mice with deficiency of only XLαs (Gnasxlm+/p–) and showed that these mice have poor suckling and perinatal survival (7Plagge A. Gordon E. Dean W. Boiani R. Cinti S. Peters J. Kelsey G. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), similar to that observed in E2m+/p– mice (12Yu S. Yu D. Lee E. Eckhaus M. Lee R. Corria Z. Accili D. Westphal H. Weinstein L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8715-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and other mouse models with disruption or loss of the paternal Gnas allele (16Skinner J.A. Cattanach B.M. Peters J.

Nature. 1985; 315: 496-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), implicating XLαs as critical for postnatal feeding adaptation in mice. We have now examined the metabolic phenotype of adult Gnasxlm+/p– mice and show that these mice have markedly reduced adiposity, increased metabolic rate with increased lipid metabolism in adipose tissue, and increased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. We provide evidence that these metabolic changes are due to increased sympathetic nervous system activity rather than adipocyte cell-autonomous effects. XLαs (or possibly XLN1) appears to be an important negative regulator of sympathetic nervous system activity in mice. We also show that XLαs expression in adipose tissue is developmentally regulated. Animals—Gnasxlm+/p– mice (7Plagge A. Gordon E. Dean W. Boiani R. Cinti S. Peters J. Kelsey G. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) were repeatedly mated with CD1 wild-type mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) for >5 generations and were maintained on a standard pellet diet (NIH-07, 5% fat by weight) and 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle. Except when noted, all experiments were performed on 12–14-week old male mutant mice and wild-type littermates. Experiments were approved by the NIDDK Animal Care and Use Committee. Body Composition, Food Intake, Metabolic Rate, and Activity Measurements—Body composition was measured using the Minispec mq10 NMR analyzer (Bruker Optics Inc., Woodlands, TX) that was calibrated with corn oil for fat mass and rat muscle for lean mass. Food intake, metabolic rates (oxygen consumption rate by indirect calorimetry), and activity levels were determined as previously described (14Yu S. Gavrilova O. Chen H. Lee R. Liu J. Pacak K. Parlow A.F. Quon M.J. Reitman M.L. Weinstein L.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The effect of the β3-specific adrenergic agonist CL316243 (19Bloom J.D. Dutia M.D. Johnson B.D. Wissner A. Burns M.G. Largis E.E. Dolan J.A. Claus T.H. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 3081-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) on metabolic rate was measured as follows. At 9 a.m. mice were placed into calorimetry chambers that were prewarmed to 30 °C. At 1 p.m. CL316243 at the indicated dose (from a 1 mg/ml stock in saline) or a saline vehicle control was injected intraperitoneally, and after a 1-h delay data were collected for 3 h. Food and water were available at all times. Microscopic Analysis—For standard histology, samples were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For mitochondrial staining, 10-μm cryostat sections were stained for succinate dehydrogenase by incubation in 130 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 mm nitro blue tetrazolium and 60 mm sodium succinate (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min. The slides were then rinsed with deionized water, dehydrated, and washed with xylene before coverslip mounting. Hyperinsulinemic-Euglycemic Clamp Studies—Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps studies and in vivo glucose flux analysis were performed as previous described (15Chen M. Haluzik M. Wolf N.J. Lorenzo J. Dietz K.R. Reitman M.L. Weinstein L.S. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 4094-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Insulin levels on samples during the clamp studies were measured by radioimmunoassay kit (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Blood, Tissue, and Urine Chemistries—Blood was obtained by retroorbital bleed. Serum glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were measured with an auto-analyzer by the NIH Clinical Chemistry Laboratory. Serum insulin, leptin, glucagon, and adiponectin were measured by Linco Research assay services. For C-peptide/insulin ratios, both were measured by radioimmunoassay (Linco). Serum resistin was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Linco). Serum corticosterone was measured by Ani Lytics, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD. Serum free fatty acids (FFA) were measured using a kit from Roche Diagnostics. Triglyceride and glycogen content of hindlimb muscles were measured as previously described (15Chen M. Haluzik M. Wolf N.J. Lorenzo J. Dietz K.R. Reitman M.L. Weinstein L.S. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 4094-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Urine was collected by bladder puncture, and catecholamines were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (20Eisenhofer G. Goldstein D.S. Stull R. Keiser H.R. Sunderland T. Murphy D.L. Kopin I.J. Clin. Chem. 1986; 32: 2030-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), and corrected by creatinine concentration within the same samples, which were measured by Ani-Lytics. Triglyceride Clearance Test—Clearance of triglycerides (12.5 μl of peanut oil/g of body weight delivered by gavage) from the circulation was measured in mice after a 4-h fast. Blood was taken before gavage and hourly for 6 h after gavage, and plasma triglycerides were measured (kit #TR22421, Thermo DMA, Waltham, MA). Glucose and Insulin Tolerance Tests—Glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed in overnight-fasted mice after intraperitoneal injection of glucose (2 mg/g) or insulin (Humulin, 0.50 mIU/g). Blood glucose levels in tail vein bleeds were measured using a Glucometer Elite (Bayer, Elkhart, IN) immediately before and at the indicated times after injection. Portal Vein Insulin Injection and Immunoblot Analysis—Overnight-fasted mice were anesthetized with avertin (0.25 mg/g of body weight intraperitoneal). Insulin (100 μl of 15 μg/ml, Sigma) was injected via the portal vein. At 2 or 4 min after injection, interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT), epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT), and hind leg muscles were dissected and immediately frozen. Tissues were then homogenized, and protein concentrations of protein extracts were measured as previously described (15Chen M. Haluzik M. Wolf N.J. Lorenzo J. Dietz K.R. Reitman M.L. Weinstein L.S. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 4094-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed on tissue extracts (1 mg of protein) using an anti-Akt1 Ab (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) as per manufacturer's instructions followed by immunoblot analysis using an anti-Akt1 phospho-Ser473 Ab (Upstate). Ab binding was determined by ECL (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences). The same blots were stripped and rehybridized with the anti-Akt1 Ab. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA was extracted from frozen tissues using TRIzol (Invitrogen) or an Mini RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and treated with DNase (DNA-free, Ambion, Austin, TX) to remove DNA contamination. Reverse transcription was performed using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Gene expression levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR using a real time PCR machine (MxP3000, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PCR reactions (20 μl total volume) included cDNA, 100 nm primers, and 10 μl of SYBR Green MasterMix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To get relative quantification, standard curves were simultaneously generated with serial dilutions of cDNA, and results were normalized to β-actin mRNA levels in each sample, which were determined simultaneously by the same method. Specificity of each RT-PCR product was indicated by its dissociation curve and the presence of a single band of expected size on acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sequences for gene-specific primers are listed in the supplementary table. Semiquantitative RT-PCR—XLαs mRNA expression was examined in BAT and WAT by semiquantitative RT-PCR. After first-strand synthesis, duplex PCR was performed (32 cycles, 60 °C annealing temperature) using a pair of XLαs-specific primers (1 μm each) and β-actin-specific primers (100 nm each) (primer sequences listed in the supplemental table). Products were separated on agarose gels, and gels were stained with ethidium bromide. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance between groups was determined using unpaired Student's t test (two-tailed) with differences considered significant at p < 0.05. Gnasxlm+/p– Mice Have Reduced Survival and Adiposity—In this study we examined the survival and adult metabolic phenotype of Gnasxlm+/p– mice, which were placed in a CD1 genetic background to compare these mice to other Gnas knock-out models that we have studied on the same genetic background. In most other inbred genetic backgrounds E2m+/p– mice have no survival beyond several days.3 In the CD1 background most Gnasxlm+/p– mice failed to suckle and died soon after birth, as was previously described in both these mice (7Plagge A. Gordon E. Dean W. Boiani R. Cinti S. Peters J. Kelsey G. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and E2m+/p– mice (12Yu S. Yu D. Lee E. Eckhaus M. Lee R. Corria Z. Accili D. Westphal H. Weinstein L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8715-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). By 3 weeks of age, Gnasxlm+/p– mice had a survival rate that was ∼27% that expected by Mendelian inheritance (8 of 59 total offspring), and the effect appeared to be similar in males and females. This survival rate is similar to the survival rate that we previously reported for E2m+/p– mice in the CD1 background (23%) (12Yu S. Yu D. Lee E. Eckhaus M. Lee R. Corria Z. Accili D. Westphal H. Weinstein L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8715-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Growth curves (Fig. 2A) demonstrate that both male and female Gnasxlm+/p– mice grew very slowly through the first 30 days relative to their wild-type littermates, and the resulting weight differences were maintained during adulthood. Adult Gnasxlm+/p– mice weighed ∼45% less than wild-type littermates and had a small but significant reduction in nasoanal body length (Fig. 2B). Body composition analysis by NMR showed that Gnasxlm+/p– mice had a markedly reduced fat mass and increased lean mass relative to total body weight (Fig. 2C). Consistent with this, the relative weights of retroperitoneal and epididymal WAT pads and interscapular BAT pads were greatly reduced in Gnasxlm+/p– mice, whereas the relative weights of most other organs were unchanged (Fig. 2D). The relative weight of testes and lungs were slightly, although significantly increased in Gnasxlm+/p– mice as compared with controls. Histology of both BAT and WAT from Gnasxlm+/p– mice showed reduced lipid accumulation and size of adipocytes (Fig. 2E). BAT from Gnasxlm+/p– mice had markedly increased succinate dehydrogenase staining compared with controls (Fig. 2F), indicating that the mutant mice had greater mitochondrial content in BAT. Overall, our findings show that, similar to E2m+/p– mice (12Yu S. Yu D. Lee E. Eckhaus M. Lee R. Corria Z. Accili D. Westphal H. Weinstein L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8715-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 14Yu S. Gavrilova O. Chen H. Lee R. Liu J. Pacak K. Parlow A.F. Quon M.J. Reitman M.L. Weinstein L.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), Gnasxlm+/p– mice have reduced preweaning survival, poor growth, and maintain a very lean phenotype in adulthood. Hypermetabolism in Gnasxlm+/p– Mice Is Associated with Increased Norepinephrine Levels—The markedly reduced adiposity of Gnasxlm+/p– mice indicates that they may have either reduced food intake or increased energy expenditure rates relative to controls. Both male and female Gnasxlm+/p– mice had significantly increased food intake when corrected for body mass (Fig. 3A), indicating that reduced adiposity is not due to hypophagia. Hyperphagia in Gnasxlm+/p– mice may be a physiologic response to low circulating leptin levels (Table 1), which is an expected consequence of their severely lean phenotype. Both resting and total energy expenditure (O2 consumption) rates were very significantly increased at both ambient temperature(24 °C)andthermoneutral temperature (30 °C) (Fig. 3B). There were no differences in the respiratory exchange ratio (ratio of CO2 produced to O2 consumed) (Fig. 3C) or activity levels (Fig. 3D) between wild-type and mutant mice. The metabolic changes are similar to those previously observed in E2m+/p– mice, although we found E2m+/p– mice to be hyperactive (14Yu S. Gavrilova O. Chen H. Lee R. Liu J. Pacak K. Parlow A.F. Quon M.J. Reitman M.L. Weinstein L.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), whereas Gnasxlm+/p– mice were not. Sex and age differences between the mice examined in this and the prior E2m+/p– mouse study may account for these discrepant results.TABLE 1Serum chemistriesWild typeGnasxlm+/p-Glucose (mg/dl)180 ± 8152 ± 6ap < 0.01 versus wild-type littermates.Cholesterol (mg/dl)132 ± 782 ± 9ap < 0.01 versus wild-type littermates.Triglycerides (mg/dl)104 ± 1645 ± 18ap < 0.01 versus wild-type littermates.Insulin (ng/ml)4.14 ± 0.900.73 ± 0.11ap < 0.01 versus wild-type littermates.Glucagon (pm)101 ± 22145 ± 96Leptin (pm)692 ± 7939 ± 19ap < 0.01 versus wild-type littermates.Adiponectin (μg/ml)17.0 ± 1.111.8 ± 0.8ap < 0.01 versus wild-type littermates.Resistin (ng/ml)8.2 ± 1.210.1 ± 1.6Corticosterone (ng/ml)169 ± 58203 ± 48a p < 0.01 versus wild-type littermates. Open table in a new tab We next examined whether the hypermetabolic state could be explained by increased metabolic responsiveness to sympathetic stimulation by measuring the resting metabolic rate after administration of various doses of the β3-adrenergic agonist CL316243 at thermoneutral temperature (30 °C). Resting metabolic rate at thermoneutrality reflects the metabolic rate in the absence of adaptive thermogenesis with minimal endogenous stimulation of adipose tissue by the sympathetic nervous system (21Pennycuik P.R. Aust. J. Exp. Biol. Med. Sci. 1967; 45: 331-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Zaror-Behrens G. Himms-Hagen J. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: E361-E366PubMed Google Scholar). Because β3 adrenergic receptors are specifically expressed in adipose tissue and CL316246 has been shown to specifically activate adipose tissue (23Gavrilova O. Marscus-Samuels B. Reitman M.L. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), increases in metabolic rate after CL316246 reflect the metabolic responsiveness of adipose tissue to catecholamine stimulation by β3-adrenergic receptors, a major receptor stimulated by sympathetic nerves in adipose tissue. Our results show that adipose tissue in Gnasxlm+/p– mice was not more sensitive to β3-adrenergic stimulation (Fig. 3E). In fact Gnasxlm+/p– mice tended to have an increased base-line activity (p = 0.079) and a somewhat reduced response to higher doses of the β3 agonist, suggesting that they may be subtly resistant to β3-adrenergic stimulation. There were no significant differences in the respiratory exchange ratio in response to the β3 agonist (Fig. 3F). These results are similar to what was previously observed before and after maximal β3 agonist stimulation in E2m+/p– mice (14Yu S. Gavrilova O. Chen H. Lee R. Liu J. Pacak K. Parlow A.F. Quon M.J. Reitman M.L. Weinstein L.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We also assessed the ability of the β3 agonist to acutely raise serum FFA levels, which is a measure of the acute lipolytic response in adipose tissue. In the fed state Gnasxlm+/p– mice tended to have elevated serum FFA levels compared with controls (p = 0.098) even though they had a reduced adipose mass (Fig. 4A). The increase in FFA levels measured 20 min after injection of CL316243 (100 μg/kg) was significantly lower in Gnasxlm+/p– mice than in controls. The ratio of unstimulated/stimulated FFA levels was significantly higher in Gnasxlm+/p– mice (0.33 ± 0.05 in Gnasxlm+/p– versus 0.21 ± 0.02 in control mice). These results are similar to the slightly reduced metabolic responsiveness to CL316243 observed in the mutant mice. In the fasted state (when insulin levels are low) Gnasxlm+/p– mice had 2-fold higher serum FFA levels than controls (Fig. 4B), indicative of a very high lipolytic rate in mutant mice. After administration of insulin (0.75 mIU/g of body weight), FFA levels fell to similar levels in Gnasxlm+/p– and control mice, indicating that the ability of insulin to suppress lipolysis is maintained in Gnasxlm+/p– mice. To assess overall sympathetic nerve activity, we measured urinary norepinephrine concentrations normalized to creatinine to correct for differences in urinary concentration and in lean mass. Similar to E2m+/p– mice (14Yu S. Gavrilova O. Chen H. Lee R. Liu J. Pacak K. Parlow A.F. Quon M.J. Reitman M.L. Weinstein L.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), both male and female Gnasxlm+/p– mice had significantly increased urine norepinephrine (NE) levels (Fig. 3G). Urine epinephrine levels, which primarily reflect adrenomedullary activity, were also increased, although the difference was only significant in males. There was no significant difference in urine creatinine concentration between the two groups (data not shown). Overall, our results suggest that increased metabolic rate in adult Gnasxlm+/p– mice is primarily the result of increased sympathetic nervous system activity (and possibly adrenomedullary secretion) rather than an inherent difference in sensitivity to metabolic stimulation. Gnasxlm+/p– Mice Have Improved Glucose Tolerance and Insulin Sensitivity—Random serum glucose, insulin, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were all significantly lower in Gnasxlm+/p– as compared with control mice (Table 1). Similar to E2m+/p– mice (15Chen M. Haluzik M. Wolf N.J. Lorenzo J. Dietz K.R. Reitman M.L. Weinstein L.S. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 4094-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), Gnasxlm+/p– mice had an increased clearance rate of an oral triglyceride load and very low muscle triglyceride levels (Figs. 4, C and D), consistent with an increased rate of overall lipid metabolism.

We characterized the effect of rosiglitazone (RSG), a thiazolidinedione, to induce vascular permeability, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, and protein kinase C (PKC) activation with edema and wt gain. In lean, fatty and diabetic Zucker rats, and endothelial insulin receptor knockout mice, RSG increased wt and vascular permeability, selectively in fat and retina, but not in heart or skeletal muscle. H2O content and wt of epididymal fat were increased by RSG and correlated to increases in capillary permeability in fat and body wt. RSG induced VEGF mRNA expression and PKC activation in fat and retina up to 2.5-fold. Ruboxistaurin, a PKCbeta isoform inhibitor, in the latter 2 wk of a 4-wk study, normalized vascular permeability in fat and decreased total wt gain, H2O content, and wt of fat vs. RSG alone but did not decrease VEGF expression, basal permeability, or food intake. Finally, RSG did not increase wt or vascular permeability in PKCbeta knockout vs. control mice. Thus, thiazolidinedione's effects on edema and wt are partially due to an adipose tissue-selective activation of PKC and vascular permeability that may be prevented by PKCbeta inhibition."

In the present study, we provide experimental evidence that consolidates and further develops this model using data from a comprehensive alanine scanning mutagenesis of uPAR combined with low resolution distance constraints defined within the complex using chemical cross-linkers as molecular rulers. The kinetic rate constants for the interaction between pro-uPA and 244 purified uPAR mutants with single-site replacements were determined by surface plasmon resonance. This complete alanine scanning of uPAR highlighted the involvement of 20 surface-exposed side chains in this interaction. Mutations causing ΔΔG ≥ 1 kcal/mol for the uPA interaction are all located within or at the rim of the central cavity uniquely formed by the assembly of all three domains in uPAR, whereas none are found outside this crevice. Identification of specific cross-linking sites in uPAR and pro-uPA enabled us to build a model of the uPAR·uPA complex in which the kringle domain of uPA was positioned by the constraints established by the range of these cross-linkers. The nature of this interaction is predominantly hydrophobic and highly asymmetric, thus emphasizing the importance of the shape and size of the central cavity when designing low molecular mass antagonists of the uPAR/uPA interaction.

However, it is impossible to reconcile these findings in one unifying molecular model of the uPAR·uPA complex, demonstrating the need to revisit the molecular basis of this high affinity interaction. Some of the inconsistencies between these previous studies undoubtedly arise because of the inherent coupling between maintenance of the three-domain structure of uPAR and its high affinity uPA binding (32Ploug M. Ellis V. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8991-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). With the appearance of our experimentally determined three-dimensional structure of uPAR in complex with a synthetic peptide antagonist solved by x-ray crystallography (33Llinas P. Le Du M.H.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1655-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), data from single-site mutagenesis of uPAR can now be interpreted with much more confidence. In the present study, we have thus assigned the functional epitope on uPAR for uPA binding as delineated by a comprehensive alanine scanning mutagenesis of intact soluble uPAR combined with kinetic measurements on the uPAR/pro-uPA interaction by surface plasmon resonance. These data have been supplemented by low resolution distance constraints established by various chemical cross-linkers acting as “molecular rulers” after identification of their primary target sites. Combining these experimental observations with the proposal of a convergent binding site displayed on both the growth factor-like domain of uPA and a synthetic peptide antagonist (33Llinas P.

All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing using an ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The majority of the secreted uPAR mutants were purified from the conditioned medium by immunoaffinity chromatography using an immobilized anti-uPAR monoclonal antibody (R2), followed by reverse-phase HPLC using a Vydac C4 column (0.46 × 25 cm) and a linear gradient (40 min) from 0 to 70% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid.

The S2 medium also contained 10 μg/ml aprotinin to prevent proteolytic cleavage at the activation site of pro-uPA. Pro-uPA was isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography using an immobilized anti-uPA monoclonal antibody (clone 6). The purity of this pro-uPA was >95%, and the preparation showed only negligible conversion to two-chain uPA as judged by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S2). The identity of the purified pro-uPAS356A was verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, which revealed two components with a mass of either 47,511.6 or 47,365.8 Da, corresponding to the disulfide-bonded polypeptide chain of pro-uPAS356A with one N-linked glycosylation at Asn302 (1039.0 Da) and, in ∼60% of the molecules, one additional O-linked fucose at Thr18 (146.1 Da). Following the same protocol, 12 different pro-uPA mutants with single-site replacement of lysine with alanine within the amino-terminal region were produced (supplemental Fig. S2).

The identity of the purified GFD was verified by MALDI mass spectrometry (average mass of 6189.6 Da; no fucosylation present at Thr18), and the protein concentration was determined using an estimated E280 nM1% of 11.8.Assessing uPAR Binding to Immobilized Pro-uPA by Surface Plasmon Resonance—All real-time interaction studies were carried out on a Biacore 3000™ (Biacore International AB, Uppsala, Sweden) in running buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20, pH 7.4). Human pro-uPAS356A (0.2-0.5 μg/ml) was immobilized covalently at pH 5.0 on a carboxymethylated dextran matrix (CM5 sensor chip) using NHS/EDC as described previously (24Gårdsvoll H. Danø K. Ploug M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37995-38003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which yielded coupling levels in three different flow cells covering the range of 200-1000 resonance units, corresponding to 0.2-1 ng/mm2 pro-uPA. For comparative evaluation of the kinetics of the uPAR/pro-uPA interaction, serial 2-fold dilutions of the various uPAR mutants (0.8-100 nm in running buffer) were analyzed in parallel for uPA binding at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 20 °C. Association was recorded for 300 s, followed by a dissociation phase of 775 s, and the derived sensorgrams for such an interaction analysis using the wild-type receptor are shown in supplemental Fig. S3. After each run, the sensor chip was regenerated by two consecutive injections of 10 μl of 0.1 m acetic acid and 0.5 m NaCl. Data processing was accomplished by double referencing, during which each sensorgram was corrected by subtraction of the signal from both a mock-coupled flow cell and an appropriate buffer run. The kinetic rate constants kon and koff were derived by nonlinear fitting of the association and dissociation phases to a simple bimolecular interaction model (uPA + uPAR ↔ uPAR·uPA) using BIAevaluation Version 4.1 software (Biacore International AB). In brief, koff values were initially derived by fitting the collected data to dR/dt =-koffR, and the corresponding kon was subsequently fitted to dR/dt = kon[uPAR](Rmax - R) - koffR, assuming pseudo first-order reaction kinetics essentially as described (38Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The curve fitting to the recorded data for the wild-type uPAR (uPARwt)/uPA interaction is shown in supplemental Fig. S3 along with the corresponding residual plot. The change in free energy (ΔΔG) caused by each mutation was calculated from ΔΔG =ΔGmut-ΔGwt = RT × ln(Kd(mut)/Kd(wt)), where Kd values were derived from the ratio of the kinetic constants koff and kon, R = 1.99 cal/mol K, and T = 293 K.Because of the limitations enforced by the logistics of this experiment, it was impossible to analyze freshly prepared protein samples for each of the large number of mutants. The entire library of uPAR alanine mutants was therefore kept frozen at -80 °C, and individual mutants were thawed and diluted in running buffer immediately before analysis. At appropriate time intervals, uPARwt was analyzed in parallel and served as a reference for calculation of ΔΔG. A number of uPAR mutants, including some of those that exhibited severely impaired kinetics for the pro-uPA interaction, were subjected to size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200™ in 10 mm phosphate and 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4) to separate uPAR monomer from any aggregated protein before reanalysis of the monomer fraction by surface plasmon resonance without prior freezing. Generally, the koff values did not changed significantly in this second analysis, but the kon values occasionally increased by up to 2-fold after size exclusion chromatography.Covalent Conjugation of uPAR·Ligand Complexes by Bifunctional Chemical Cross-linkers—Covalent chemical conjugation via ϵ-amines of optimally positioned lysine residues in preformed uPAR·pro-uPA or uPAR·ATF complexes was introduced by various homobifunctional NHS esters with variable spacer arm lengths (DSS, ∼11.4 Å; DSG, ∼7.7 Å; and DST, ∼6.4 Å). Concentrated stock solutions of these chemical cross-linkers were prepared in dry Me2SO and were diluted in Me2SO to the working solutions (5-20 mm) immediately prior to use. Noncovalent complexes between 4 nm 125I-labeled ATF and either 20 nm uPARwt or single-site lysine mutant uPAR were allowed to preform during a 60-min incubation at 4 °C in cross-linking buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 8.1, containing 0.2% (w/v) CHAPS). Covalent cross-linking of the preformed complexes was accomplished by a 10-15 min incubation with the respective cross-linker (0.1-1 mm), after which the reaction was quenched by addition of 100 mm CH3COONH4. In other experiments, 4 nm 125I-labeled uPAR was subjected to chemical cross-linking to either pro-uPAS356A or one of the 12 different single-site lysine mutants of pro-uPA. Cross-linking efficiency was visualized by SDS-PAGE of the reduced and alkylated samples, followed by autoradiography.Zero-length Cross-linking of uPAR·GFD Complexes Using Carbodiimide—Monomeric uPAR (10 μm; prepared by size exclusion chromatography as describe above) was mixed with 90 μm GFDfor1hat4 °Cto allow the formation of noncovalent uPAR·GFD complexes. Zero-length cross-linking between optimally positioned amino and carboxylate groups was achieved by additional incubation overnight at 20 °C with 5 mm EDC added from a freshly prepared stock solution in H2O. Cross-linking efficiency was assessed by SDS-PAGE of reduced and carbamidomethylated samples. The relevant Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained bands were excised from the dried gel and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion in parallel using either 16O- or 18O-enriched H2O as solvent. This solvent-induced “isotope coding” of tryptic peptides, which causes a specific mass shift of 8 Da for cross-linked peptides with two carboxyl termini (39Back J.W. Notenboom V. de Koning L.J. Muijsers A.O. Sixma T.K. de Koster C.G. de Jong L. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4417-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), facilitated the identification of these particular peptides by subsequent mass spectrometric analyses by nanoflow reverse-phase liquid chromatography connected to a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-Tof Ultima, Micromass, Manchester, UK). The further identification of such cross-linked peptides was enabled by the high mass accuracy and precision obtained using a 7-Tesla linear quadrupole ion trap-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (LTQ FT™, Thermo Electron Corp., Bremen) with a modified nanoelectrospray ion source (Proxeon Biosystems, Odense, Denmark).Molecular Modeling of uPAR Complexes—Molecular modeling of uPAR·GFD complexes based on a convergence in the receptor-binding motif between the β-hairpin in the GFD of uPA and the α-helix of a linear peptide antagonist was performed essentially as described (33Llinas P.

But here we show that the 'chuck' of the 'whine-chuck' mating call of the túngara frog, Physalaemus pustulosus, is caused by a fibrous mass attached to the vocal folds; the chuck is eliminated by removal of this structure, although the frog still tries to produce the sound. Sexual selection affects the acoustic complexity of the frog's call, so evolution may have shaped this unusual vocalization, which is akin to the two-voiced song of songbirds."

During the last decades, the use of high resolution electrophysiological techniques to study ion channels has provided a large amount of information on functional aspects of these important membrane proteins. Such a detailed information on channel function, however, has not been accompanied by structural knowledge until recently, when several structurally simpler homologues of mammalian ion channels found in extremophyle bacteria or Archaea and remarkably resistant to harsh experimental conditions, have been purified, crystallized and their structure solved at high resolution by x-ray diffraction methods (1Booth I.R.

Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar), and, although the x-ray structure corresponds to a closed channel conformation, it has contributed much to our current understanding of ion selectivity and permeation. Ironically, there was little or no functional information on KcsA by the time its structure was solved, and then several groups undertook the task of characterizing its single channel properties, which has been surrounded by controversy. For instance, Schrempf's group, discoverers of KcsA in S. lividans, reported a strong dependence of channel opening on acidic pH, multiple conductance states with opening probabilities near 0.5, and unusual permeabilities to Na+, Li+, Ca2+, or Mg2+, along with K+ (7Schrempf H.

Physiol. 1999; 114: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 11LeMasurier M. Heginbotham L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) using purified KcsA reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers found a single conductance state with a much lower opening probability, as well as orthodox ion selectivity and other properties to validate KcsA as a bona fide K+ channel and as a faithful structural model for these molecules. The above discrepancies were never fully explained but, still, it became generally accepted that KcsA behaves as a moderately voltage-dependent, K+-selective channel with a characteristic low opening probability and the peculiar property of opening only in response to very acidic pH conditions at the intracellular side of the membrane. More recently, however, it was found that KcsA opens also at neutral pH when subjected to an outward K+ gradient (12Zakharian E. Reusch R.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been proposed that a more “physiological” version of KcsA might correspond to a supramolecular conductive complex in which the channel would coassemble with polyhydroxybutyrate and inorganic polyphosphates (13Zakharian E. Reusch R.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which are abundant reservoir materials in many prokaryotes. In this report we have used excised membrane patches from reconstituted giant liposomes containing purified KcsA. Through the analysis of a large number of patch clamp recordings we found a clearly diverse functional behavior for the KcsA channel. The more frequent pattern of activity corresponds to the low opening probability and acidic pH-dependent channel referred above, but other activity patterns have been detected as well, which are characterized by a high channel opening probability at both acidic and neutral pH. As an additional salient feature, the latter recordings show frequent coupled gating involving multiple channels. These observations are unprecedented, and we interpret them based on the additional finding that heterogeneous “cluster”-like supramolecular assemblies of KcsA are formed, into which the channels adopt different, integrated behaviors. Constructs and Mutants—The wild-type KcsA construct contained the kcsA gene of S. lividans cloned in-frame into the pQE30 vector (Qiagen), which provided ampicillin resistance and a N-terminal hexahistidine tag (14Molina M.L. Encinar J.A. Barrera F.N. Fernandez-Ballester G. Riquelme G. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14924-14931Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The KcsA S22C mutant was obtained (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) by generating PCR fragments using pairs of complementary mutant primers, sense primer 5′-CTC GGG CGC CAC GGC TGT GCG CTG CAC TGG and antisense primer 5′-CCA GTG CAG CGC ACA GCC GTG GCG CCC GAG. The KcsA S22C mutant sequence was verified by dideoxy-nucleotide sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—Expression of the wild-type KcsA protein and the KcsA S22C mutant in Escherichia coli M15 (pRep4) cells, and its purification by affinity chromatography on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column, was carried out as reported previously (14Molina M.L. Encinar J.A. Barrera F.N. Fernandez-Ballester G. Riquelme G. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14924-14931Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The purified protein consisted primarily of the characteristic SDS-resistant tetramer, which is accompanied by monomeric KcsA as a minor component and in sufficiently loaded SDS-PAGE gels, by higher molecular weight, SDS-resistant KcsA multimers. All the above KcsA species were immunoreactive against commercial anti-His tag monoclonal antibodies (see the inset to Fig. 8A). The expression yields and the SDS-PAGE profile of the KcsA S22C mutant were very similar to those exhibited by the wild-type KcsA. The protein concentration was determined by the DC-Protein colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad), relative to a bovine serum albumin standard. When expressed in molar terms, the protein concentration refers to KcsA tetramers. 1-125 KcsA was prepared by chymotrypsin hydrolysis of wild-type KcsA as described earlier (14Molina M.L. Encinar J.A. Barrera F.N. Fernandez-Ballester G. Riquelme G. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14924-14931Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of Proteins into Asolectin Lipid Vesicles and Preparation of Giant Liposomes—Batches of large unilamellar vesicles of asolectin (soybean lipids, type II-S, Sigma) were prepared at 25 mg/ml as described earlier (15Riquelme G. Lopez E. Garcia-Segura L.M. Ferragut J.A. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11215-11222Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl (reconstitution buffer) and stored in liquid N2. The purified DDM-solubilized protein (wild-type KcsA, 1-125 KcsA, or fluorescently labeled KcsA S22C derivatives, depending on the different experiments) was mixed with the above asolectin vesicles previously resolubilized in 3 mm DDM. Reconstituted liposomes were formed by removing the detergent by gel filtration (14Molina M.L. Encinar J.A. Barrera F.N. Fernandez-Ballester G. Riquelme G. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14924-14931Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The protein-containing reconstituted vesicles eluted in the void volume and were pooled, centrifuged 30 min at 300,000 × g, resuspended at 1 mg of protein/ml in reconstitution buffer, divided into aliquots, and stored in liquid N2. Multilamellar giant liposomes (up to 50-100 μm in diameter) were prepared by submitting a mixture of the reconstituted vesicles (usually containing 50 μg of protein) and asolectin lipid vesicles (25 mg of total lipids) to a cycle of partial dehydration/rehydration (15Riquelme G. Lopez E. Garcia-Segura L.M. Ferragut J.A. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11215-11222Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), with the exception that the dehydration solution used here was 10 mm Hepes (potassium salt) buffer, pH 7, containing 5% ethylene glycol and the rehydration solution was 10 mm Hepes (potassium salt) buffer, pH 7. As a control, each of the different batches of asolectin vesicles was also used to prepare protein-free giant liposomes. Those liposome batches, posing difficulties to obtain high resistance seals (see below) or showing erratic baselines in the patch clamp recordings because of remaining detergent or other reasons, were discarded. Electrophysiological Recordings—For patch clamp measurements of channel activity, aliquots (3-6 μl) of giant liposomes were deposited onto 3.5-cm Petri dishes and mixed with 2 ml of the buffer of choice for electrical recording (bath solution; usually 10 mm Mes buffer, pH 4, containing 100 mm KCl). Giga seals were formed on giant liposomes with borosilicate microelectrodes (Sutter Instruments) of 7-10 megohms open resistances, filled with 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7, 100 mm KCl (pipette solution). After sealing, excised inside-out patches were obtained by withdrawing the pipette from the liposome surface. Standard patch clamp recordings (16Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar) were obtained using either Axopatch 200A (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) or EPC-9 (Heka Electronic, Lambrecht/Pfalzt, Germany) patch clamp amplifiers, at a gain of 50 mV/pA. The holding potential was applied to the interior of the patch pipette, and the bath was maintained at virtual ground (V = Vbath - Vpipette). An Ag-AgCl wire was used as the reference electrode through an agar bridge, and the junction potential was compensated when necessary. Routinely, the membrane patches were subjected to a protocol of pulses and/or voltage ramps. The protocol of pulses went from -200 to +200 mV, at 50-mV intervals, and 2 s of recording at each individual voltage was used, holding the patch back to 0 mV between the different voltage steps. The voltage ramps went from -200 to +200 mV, during a 3-s scan. All measurements were made at room temperature. Recordings were filtered at 1 kHz, and the data were analyzed off-line with the pClamp9 software (Axon Instruments). Recordings from giant liposomes prepared from either 50 or 100 μg of wild-type KcsA protein and registered under identical experimental conditions (pH 4 at the bath and pH 7 at the pipette solutions) exhibited qualitatively similar patterns of ion channel activity but differed in complexity (a larger number of events as the amount of protein increased) and in the percent of silent patches, which went from only 9% (n = 23) when using 100 μg of protein, to ∼38% (n = 150) for 50 μg of protein, respectively. Thus, for practical purposes, we studied in more detail the giant liposomes made from 50 μg of protein, which became our “standard” experimental condition. SDS-PAGE and Western Immunoblotting—For SDS-PAGE analysis, the protein-containing samples were mixed with an equal volume of electrophoresis buffer sample (20 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 4% SDS) and applied to a 13.5% acrylamide gel in the presence of 0.1% SDS (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were incubated with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS-T (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20). The His-tagged KcsA was detected with a mouse monoclonal anti-Tetra-His antibody (1:1000 dilution, Qiagen) in PBS-T. After washing, the immunoblots were incubated with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, Sigma) in PBS-T. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by chemiluminescent ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted in a Beckman Optima XL-I ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) with an An50Ti eight-hole rotor and double-sector Eponcharcoal centerpieces. DDM-solubilized KcsA samples at protein concentrations ranging 0.5-10 μm in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm KCl and 5 mm DDM, were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm, 20 °C, and the absorbance at 280 nm was followed. Differential sedimentation coefficient distributions, c(s), were calculated by least-squares boundary modeling of sedimentation velocity data by using the program SEDFIT (18Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3064) Google Scholar, 19Gonzalez J.M. Velez M. Jimenez M. Alfonso C. Schuck P. Mingorance J. Vicente M. Minton A.P. Rivas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1895-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Labeling of KcsA—Aliquots of the sulfhydryl-containing mutant KcsA S22C at 7 μm in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7, 100 mm KCl and 5 mm DDM were treated for 1 h in the dark with a 10-fold molar excess of Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride to keep the sulfhydryl groups in a reduced form. The maleimide Alexa probes (Alexa Fluor® 546 C5-maleimide or Alexa Fluor® 647 C2-maleimide; Molecular Probes) were dissolved in buffer and added in a 10-fold molar excess to the reduced KcsA samples. After 2-h incubation at 4 °C, an excess of 2-mercaptoethanol was added to react with the excess free probe. Finally, the fluorescently labeled KcsA was separated from the free fluorophores by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 (medium), which also eliminates the minor population of monomeric KcsA present in the purified KcsA preparations. Monitoring of the absorbance at either 546 or 647 nm was used to define the elution profile, while the protein was detected by SDS-PAGE of the different fractions. Routinely, yields ranging 20 to 30% labeling of the available sulfhydryls were obtained. Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—Stock solutions of Alexa 546-labeled KcsA in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm DDM were subjected to successive dilutions with the same buffer to attain different protein concentrations. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy 《r》 was determined at 25 °C in an SLM-8000C spectrofluorometer equipped with Glan-Thompson polarizers in the “L” format, by measuring the vertical (IVV) and horizontal (IVH) components of the fluorescence emission with excitation polarized vertically, as defined by (20Lackowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 1999; (pp. , Plenum Press, New York): 291-391Crossref Google Scholar), 〈r〉=(IVV−G∗IVH)/(IVV+2∗G∗IVH)(Eq.1) where the G factor (G = IHV/IHH) corrects for the transmission bias introduced by the detection system. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 525 and 574 nm, respectively. The protein and DDM concentration were low enough to prevent scattering artifacts that could result in an artificial depolarization of the fluorescence. Similar measurements carried out using Alexa 647-labeled KcsA yielded essentially identical results. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Measurements—Alexa 546- and Alexa 647-labeled KcsA were used as the donor-acceptor pair for FRET measurements both in detergent solution (10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm DDM) and in reconstituted asolectin lipid vesicles. For the latter, the reconstituted vesicles were prepared at a fixed asolectin lipid to total protein weight ratio of 10:1 in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7, 100 mm KCl. Because the donor concentration (∼6 μg of protein/ml) was not identical in the different samples, particularly in the reconstituted vesicles, FRET efficiency (E) was not calculated through the usual method of quenching of donor steady-state emission. Instead, two other approaches were used. In the first approach, E was determined by measuring the increase in fluorescence of the acceptor due to energy transfer and comparing this to the residual donor emission (21Selvin P.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 275-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). For this, steady-state emission scans of the samples at different donor to acceptor ratios were recorded in an SLM-8000C spectrofluorometer at an excitation wavelength of 525 nm and at emission wavelengths from 540 to 750 nm at 1-nm intervals, and corrected for background and instrument response. The acceptor emission coming from its direct excitation at 525 nm was negligible in the reconstituted samples but not in detergent solution, where such contribution was always subtracted. Afterward, the spectra were normalized to the donor maximum at 574 nm where there is no acceptor fluorescence. Then, the donor spectrum was subtracted from each of the donors plus acceptor spectra, and the integrated areas of the resulting curves were calculated (IAD). The area under the donor spectrum was also calculated (ID), and then E results from, E=(IAD/qA)/(ID/qD+IAD/qA) (Eq.2) where qA (0.80) and qD (0.85 (22Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Bishop-Stewart J. Bhalgat M.K. Millard P.J. Mao F. Leung W.Y. Haugland R.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar)) are the experimentally determined quantum yields of the acceptor and donor, respectively. The second approach estimates the transfer efficiency in samples with different donor concentration from measurements of the donor fluorescence decay at different donor to acceptor ratios. Fluorescence decays were measured in a fluorescence lifetime instrument (Photon Technology International Inc.) using a proprietary stroboscopic detection technique (23James D.R. Siemiarczuk A. Ware W.R. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1992; 63: 1710-1716Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 24Liu R. Siemiarczuk A. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14927-14938Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The system used a GL-330 pulsed nitrogen laser pumping a GL-302 high resolution dye laser. The dye laser output at 525 nm was fitted to the sample compartment via fiber optics. The emission wavelength was 574 nm. Fluorescence decays were analyzed using a non-linear least-squares regression method. The average decay times, which are proportional to the steady-state intensities, were calculated from the results of multiexponential fits by using the expression, 〈τ〉=(Σaiτi)/(Σai)(Eq.3) where ai and τi represent the pre-exponential factors and the lifetimes, respectively. From these, E was calculated using the expression (20Lackowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 1999; (pp. , Plenum Press, New York): 291-391Crossref Google Scholar), E=1−τDA/τD(Eq.4) where τDA and τD are the average fluorescence lifetimes of the donor in the presence and in the absence of acceptor, respectively. Finally, the theoretical contribution to FRET arising purely from the random distribution of labeled KcsA donors and acceptors within the two-dimensional membrane bilayer was estimated according to Capeta et al. (25Capeta R.C. Poveda J.A. Loura L.M. J. Fluoresc. 2006; 16: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Such calculations take into account three parameters, βw, β1, and B. βw, the interplanar spacing between donors and acceptors, was fixed to zero, because both probes are located at cysteine 22 in different KcsA molecules. β1 is the ratio R1/R0, where R1, the exclusion distance, represents the minimal distance between two probes, and R0 is the Förster's distance. R1 was fixed as twice the protein radius (51.9 Å in the KcsA crystal structure), whereas R0 was 68 Å as calculated from the spectral overlap and the donor quantum yield. B, the relative enrichment factor for the acceptor in the proximities of the donor was fixed to 1.05, which assumes a random distribution of donors and acceptors in the bilayer. A similar theoretical curve was also obtained by applying other models such as that from Wolber and Hudson (26Wolber P.K. Hudson B.S. Biophys. J. 1979; 28: 197-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Aliquots (3-6 μl) of giant liposomes containing fluorescently labeled KcsA were deposited on a coverslip mounted on a custom-made chamber and mixed with 1 ml of 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl. The samples were visualized without any further treatment by using an LSM 5 Pascal confocal laser scanning microscope (Axiovert 200M, Carl Zeiss) and a Plan-Neofluar 40×/1.3 objective. Giant liposomes containing Alexa 546-labeled KcsA were excited with the 543 nm line of an argon laser, and the emitted light was filtered through a 560-615 nm band pass filter. For giant liposomes containing Alexa 647-labeled KcsA, the 633 nm line of a He-Ne laser was used for excitation, whereas the emitted light was filtered through a 650 nm long pass filter. For FRET images, giant liposomes containing both Alexa 546- and Alexa 647-labeled KcsA, usually at a 1:1 donor/acceptor ratio, were excited at the above 543 nm emission line of the argon laser and the emission was filtered through the 650 long pass filter. These conditions do not require any spectral bleed-through correction. Giant liposomes containing the fluorescently labeled phospholipid NBD-DMPE, added (0.05%) to the asolectin lipids during reconstitution, were visualized by exciting the NBD-DMPE probe with the 488 nm emission line of the argon laser and using a 505-560 nm band pass emission filter. Diverse Functional Behavior of KcsA: Low and High Channel Opening Probability Patterns—Unless stated otherwise, excised membrane patches from giant liposomes prepared from 50 μg of purified KcsA and 25 mg of asolectin lipids (see “Experimental Procedures”) were always used in these experiments. The recording bath solution was 10 mm Mes buffer, pH 4, containing 100 mm KCl, whereas the pipette solution was 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7, 100 mm KCl. Despite the identical experimental conditions, different types of activity were distinguished in these patches (n = 93) and classified as “low” or “high” channel opening probability patterns based on the probability of finding channel opening events in the recordings (Fig. 1). These experiments used a large number of different batches of both purified KcsA and asolectin lipids to prepare the giant liposomes. However, we found no dependence with either the moment in which the experiments were carried out or with the different batches used. Moreover, the different activity patterns illustrated in Fig. 1 were often observed in different patches from the same preparation of giant liposomes. Fig. 1 shows typical voltage ramps from protein-free patches used as a control (Fig. 1A), as well as from different KcsA-containing patches representative of the different opening probability patterns observed. Fig. 1B shows a few openings in the form of bursts of activity, but the channels are closed most of the time, which are well known reported features of KcsA (10Heginbotham L. LeMasurier M. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 11LeMasurier M. Heginbotham L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we named this pattern “low channel opening probability” or LOP pattern, seen in 55% of the recordings (n = 51). On the contrary, Fig. 1 (C and D) shows examples of activity patterns in which the most salient feature is that the channels are opened most of the time. These patches were named as “high channel opening probability” or HOP patterns and were observed in 45% of the cases (n = 42), including some instances in which somewhat intermediate behaviors between those depicted in Fig. 1 (C and D) were detected in the recordings. The predominant HOP pattern corresponds to that in Fig. 1C (n = 26), in which similar current is conducted at either positive or negative potentials, following an almost symmetrical sigmoid-like voltage dependence. Characteristically, channel closings are observed at extreme voltages and variable flickering may sometimes be present at any of the voltages studied. Fig. 1D shows a different HOP pattern encountered with a lower incidence (n = 10) in which more current is conducted at negative than at positive voltages, thus showing an inward rectifier behavior. These latter recordings do not show a predominance of channel closings at the extreme values in the voltage ramps, while variable flickering (from moderate to very intense) may also be present. This variability observed when KcsA is reconstituted into giant liposomes was not explicitly reported in the earlier characterization of KcsA in planar lipid bilayers, but it seems reminiscent of that referred more recently (27Choi H. Heginbotham L. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2137-2144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using the latter reconstituted system. Regardless of the pattern exhibited, additional experiments carried out under asymmetrical KCl concentrations (400 and 100 mm KCl in the bath and pipette solutions, respectively, under otherwise identical conditions) yielded very similar reversal potentials, which were near that corresponding to potassium under these gradient conditions (not shown). Curiously, a small population of patches (n = 6) was also found in which the main f"

Helicobacter pylori γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (HpGT) was selected as a model system to study the mechanistic details of autoprocessing and amide bond hydrolysis. In contrast to previously reported γGT, large quantities of HpGT were expressed solubly in the inactive precursor form. The 60-kDa proenzyme was kinetically competent to form the mature 40- and 20-kDa subunits and exhibited maximal autoprocessing activity at neutral pH. The activated enzyme hydrolyzed the γ-glutamyl amide bond of several substrates with comparable rates, but exhibited limited transpeptidase activity relative to mammalian γGT. As with autoprocessing, maximal enzymatic activity was observed at neutral pH, with hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate as the rate-limiting step. Coexpression of the 20- and 40-kDa subunits of HpGT uncoupled autoprocessing from enzymatic activity and resulted in a fully active heterotetramer with kinetic constants similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. The specific contributions of a conserved threonine residue (Thr380) to autoprocessing and hydrolase activities were examined by mutagenesis using both the standard and coexpression systems. The results of these studies indicate that the γ-methyl group of Thr380 orients the hydroxyl group of this conserved residue, which is required for both the processing and hydrolase reactions. γ-Glutamyltranspeptidase (γGT), a member of the N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase superfamily, initiates extracellular glutathione reclamation by cleaving the γ-glutamyl amide bond of the tripeptide.

Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that colonizes the gastric mucosa. Infection puts the individual at greater risk for developing gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer (1Bjorkholm B. Falk P. Engstrand L. Nyren O. J. Intern. Med. 2003; 253: 102-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 2Sharma P. Vakil N. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 17: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). H. pylori γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (Hp-GT) 3The abbreviations used are: HpGT, H. pylori γ-glutamyltranspeptidase; γGT, γ-glutamyltranspeptidase; GNA, l-glutamic acid γ-(4-nitroanilide). is a glutathione-degrading enzyme that has been shown to be a virulence factor in infection (3Chevalier C. Thiberge J.M. Ferrero R.L. Labigne A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1359-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 4McGovern K.J. Blanchard T.G. Gutierrez J.A. Czinn S.J. Krakowka S. Youngman P. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4168-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). H. pylori lacking γ-glutamyltranspeptidase has been shown to grow normally in vitro, but exhibits diminished growth rates within the gut in animal model systems. Bacterial loads of the HpGT-deficient strains are reduced by nearly 70% relative to the parental strain. Although not essential for colonization, HpGT clearly confers a growth advantage to the bacteria in vivo by mechanisms that remain unclear. HpGT has also been shown to up-regulate COX-2 and epidermal growth factor-related peptides in human gastric mucosal cells (5Busiello I. Acquaviva R. Di Popolo A. Blanchard T.G. Ricci V. Romano M. Zarrilli R. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and to induce apoptosis in human gastric epithelial cells (6Shibayama K. Kamachi K. Nagata N. Yagi T. Nada T. Doi Y. Shibata N. Yokoyama K. Yamane K. Kato H. Iinuma Y. Arakawa Y. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Both these activities are abolished by inactivation of the enzyme with mechanism-based inhibitors. Despite its demonstrated involvement in H. pylori colonization, persistence, and disease progression, biochemical characterizations of HpGT have been limited. The reclamation of extracellular glutathione and its conjugates is initiated by γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (γGT). The enzyme cleaves the γ-glutamyl amide bond to liberate cysteinylglycine, and the catalytic mechanism proceeds via a γ-glutamyl-enzyme intermediate (7Tate S.S. Meister A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 39: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 8Allison R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 419-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9Taniguchi N. Ikeda Y. Adv.

Castonguay R. Lherbet C. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 401: 449-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The γ-glutamyl group can be transferred to water (hydrolysis) or to an amino acid or short peptide (transpeptidation). Whereas mammalian γGTs are embedded in the plasma membrane by a single N-terminal transmembrane anchor and are heterologously glycosylated, bacterial homologs are soluble and localized to the periplasmic space. Overall, the γGTs are highly conserved, with mammalian and bacterial homologs often sharing >25% sequence identity. A required post-translational modification is the maturation of the precursor protein. γGT is synthesized as a 60-kDa polypeptide, and cleavage of the proenzyme yields a heterodimer composed of a 40- and a 20-kDa subunit (see Scheme 1) (3Chevalier C. Thiberge J.M. Ferrero R.L. Labigne A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1359-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 12Suzuki H. Kumagai H. Echigo T. Tochikura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Methods Enzymol. 2005; 401: 426-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Processing of γGT is thought to be an intramolecular autocatalytic event, and a mechanism has been proposed in which processing proceeds via a nitrogen → oxygen acyl shift, with a conserved threonine residue serving as the nucleophile (15Suzuki H. Kumagai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43536-43543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Based on its enzymatic function and autoprocessing activity, γGT has been classified as an Ntn (N-terminal nucleophile) hydrolase (15Suzuki H. Kumagai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43536-43543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Members of the Ntn hydrolase family contain an αββα-core structure, are autocatalytically processed to yield an active enzyme, and catalyze amide bond hydrolysis (16Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C. Smith J.L. Tomchick D.R. Murzin A.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 17Oinonen C. Rouvinen J. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2329-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The new N-terminal residue of the processed enzyme, typically a serine, threonine, or cysteine residue, then serves as a nucleophile in the catalytic mechanism. Although the general features of the function of HpGT can be inferred based on its classification as an Ntn hydrolase, many mechanistic details of the autoactivation and catalytic function of HpGT have not been addressed. In this study, we isolated and biochemically characterized recombinant H. pylori γ-glutamyltranspeptidase. In contrast to previous reports of γGT purified from other organisms, the solubly expressed protein was isolated primarily as the 60-kDa precursor. This allowed us an opportunity to examine the autoprocessing of the protein. The rate of maturation was maximal at neutral pH, as was the enzymatic activity of the mature α2β2-heterotetramer. We used biochemical measurements of enzymatic activity in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis and a coexpression system to investigate the involvement of a conserved threonine residue in the processing and catalytic activities. Generation of Wild-type and Mutant HpGT Expression Constructs—The isolation of HpGT has been described (3Chevalier C. Thiberge J.M. Ferrero R.L. Labigne A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1359-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and its sequence corresponds to a predicted open reading frame within the H. pylori genome (KEGG Data Base entry HP1118) (18Alm R.A.

Fraser C.M. Venter J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (3021) Google Scholar). Although encoded by a single gene, the protein was isolated as two polypeptides of ∼40 and ∼20 kDa. Primers were designed to amplify HpGT, excluding a 26-amino acid signal sequence that targets the enzyme to the periplasmic space (3Chevalier C. Thiberge J.M. Ferrero R.L. Labigne A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1359-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Using H. pylori genomic DNA (American Type Culture Collection) as a template, a 1.6-kb DNA fragment was amplified by PCR and inserted into a pET-28a expression vector (Novagen) incorporating a thrombin-cleavable N-terminal histidine tag. The resulting expression construct (pET-28/HpGT) was sequenced at the Genomics Core Facility of the University of Nebraska (Lincoln, NE) and confirmed to be identical to HP1118 excluding the signal sequence. Expression constructs for individual subunits of the processed enzyme were generated. The gene sequence for the N-terminal 40-kDa subunit was amplified by PCR, incorporating SpeI and SalI restriction sites. The insert was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into the pET-28a expression vector digested with NheI and SalI. Similarly, the gene sequence for the C-terminal 20-kDa subunit was amplified by PCR, incorporating NdeI and SalI restriction sites. The resultant 0.6-kb PCR product was digested with the relevant enzymes and ligated into a similarly digested pET-24a expression vector (Novagen), thus incorporating a C-terminal histidine tag. A bicistronic construct was also generated to express the N-terminal 40-kDa and C-terminal 20-kDa subunits separately but concurrently. The full-length HpGT expression construct was used as a template, and the HpGT sequence corresponding to the 20-kDa subunit was amplified by PCR, incorporating NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. The product was digested with the relevant enzymes and ligated into a similarly digested the pETDuet expression vector (Novagen). The dual expression vector containing the 20-kDa coding sequence was amplified and isolated. Next, the coding sequence for the 40-kDa subunit was excised from the above 40-kDa expression vector using NcoI and SalI. The resultant 1-kb fragment was gel-purified and ligated into a similarly digested pET-Duet expression vector containing the 20-kDa subunit sequence. The completed construct (HpGT-Duet) contained an N-terminal histidine tag on the 40-kDa subunit and an N-terminal methionine on the 20-kDa subunit. Point mutations were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol, and all constructs were verified by sequencing at the Genomics Core Facility of the University of Nebraska. Expression and Purification of HpGT—The pET-28/HpGT expression construct was used to transform Escherichia coli strain Rosetta(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). Cultures grown at 30 °C to A600 nm = 0.6–0.8 in 2× YT medium containing 34 mg/liter chloramphenicol and 30 mg/liter kanamycin were induced for 4 h by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 500 μm. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole), lysed by sonication, and centrifuged. The supernatant was treated with 0.35% polyethyleneimine at 4 °C and centrifuged to separate precipitated nucleic acids from the protein-containing supernatant. The protein was purified by affinity chromatography using a nickel-chelating column (Novagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant HpGT was concentrated, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and stored at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were estimated using a calculated extinction coefficient based on aromatic residue content (A280 nm of 1 mg/ml solution = 0.766) (20Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). The histidine tag used for affinity purification was removed by proteolytic cleavage with thrombin (1 unit of thrombin/mg of HpGT, incubated overnight at 18 °C), which left an additional seven residues (GSHMASA) on the N terminus of HpGT. Following thrombin incubation, >50% of HpGT was found in the processed form. To ensure complete maturation of the enzyme, it was incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. The sample was centrifuged to remove precipitated proteins, concentrated, and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4). A similar protocol was followed for each of the expression constructs with the following modifications. After ascertaining that the N-terminal histidine tag did not impact the processing or enzymatic activity of the wild-type enzyme, the thrombin cleavage step was omitted from all subsequent enzyme purifications. The HpGT-Duet construct confers resistance to ampicillin, and kanamycin was thus replaced with 100 mg/liter ampicillin. For HpGT generated using the pETDuet expression construct (HpGT-Duet), the enzyme was isolated in its mature form, and additional incubations were not required. Kinetic Characterizations of HpGT—To determine the rate of processing and its effects on catalytic activity, unprocessed HpGT was purified as described above with the following modifications. After concentration and dialysis of the enzyme, it was flash-frozen and stored at –80 °C to limit processing. It is important to note that <10% of the protein was cleaved after purification (see Fig. 1A, lane 1). The following day, HpGT (1 mg/ml) was thawed and incubated in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) at 37 °C. At the indicated times, an aliquot was removed, assayed for hydrolase activity as described below, and denatured by boiling in SDS loading buffer for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained using GelCode Blue (Pierce). To quantify the degree of processing, a digital image of the gel was taken, and densitometric measurements were made on the 20-, 40-, and 60-kDa bands at each time point. For wild-type HpGT, bands at 30 h (see Fig. 1A, lane 8) were taken to represent complete cleavage, and the percent processing was calculated for the 40-kDa band at a given time point. The percent processing values were plotted versus time to obtain a processing rate (see Fig. 1B). A similar analysis was performed with the T380S mutant and required an extended incubation of 30 days. Representative plots from three or more determinations are shown. To examine the pH profile of autoprocessing, a citrate/phosphate buffer system of constant ionic strength (21Elving P.J. Markowitz J.M. Rosenthal I. Anal. Biochem. 1956; 28: 1179-1180Google Scholar) was used, and the percent processing was calculated for each band at a given time point and averaged. The cleavage of the γ-glutamyl group of the physiological substrate glutathione was assessed using a coupled assay system to detect the release of glutamate. HpGT (10 μg/ml) in 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.0) was incubated with 20 mm glutathione at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by boiling, and precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation. Parallel incubations were performed in the absence of HpGT to establish the non-enzymatic rate of hydrolysis. The amount of glutamate released was determined using a glutamate dehydrogenase assay following the conversion of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate concomitant with the production of NADH. Aliquots of the HpGT reaction mixtures were withdrawn, incubated at 37 °C with glutamate dehydrogenase (0.1 mg/ml; Sigma) and NAD+ (2 mm), and allowed to come to equilibrium (>2 h). The absorbance at 340 nm was measured, and a standard curve for glutamate (0–100 μm) was determined. Similar experiments were performed using glutamine as the HpGT substrate. For routine enzymatic characterizations, the substrate analog l-glutamic acid γ-(4-nitroanilide) (GNA) was used (11Keillor J.W. Castonguay R. Lherbet C. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 401: 449-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Tate S.S. Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 400-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The release of 4-nitroaniline can be monitored continuously at 412 nm, and concentrations can be determined using the reported extinction coefficient of 8800 m–1 cm–1. For standard assays, hydrolysis activity measurements were made in 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm GNA at 25 °C using a Cary 50 spectrophotometer. The pH profile of the enzymatic activity was assessed using a citrate/phosphate buffer system of constant ionic strength (21Elving P.J. Markowitz J.M. Rosenthal I. Anal. Biochem. 1956; 28: 1179-1180Google Scholar). To determine the apparent kinetic constants, HpGT activity was assayed at various concentrations of GNA ranging from 1 to 1000 μm. The reaction exhibited saturation kinetics with respect to GNA, and the data were fit using the Michaelis-Menten equation to determine Km and Vmax values. To assess transpeptidation to an acceptor substrate, 20 mm glycylglycine was added to the assay mixture. Pre-steady-state kinetic studies were also performed. HpGT (17 μm final concentration) was rapidly mixed with GNA (1 mm final concentration) at 10 °C, and the absorbance at 412 nm was monitored using an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow apparatus (23Keillor J.W. Menard A. Castonguay R. Lherbet C. Rivard C. J. Phys. Org. Chem. 2004; 17: 529-536Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Molecular Mass Determination of HpGT—Purified HpGT was loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) and separated by fast protein liquid chromatography in 50 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.0) containing 150 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Size determination was made by comparison with molecular mass standards (Amersham Biosciences) chromatographed under the same conditions. The molecular mass standards used were as follows: thyroglobulin, 699 kDa; ferritin, 416 kDa; catalase, 219 kDa; aldolase, 176 kDa; albumin, 67 kDa; ovalbumin, 47 kDa; chymotrypsinogen A, 20 kDa; and RNase A, 15 kDa. Dynamic light scattering experiments were performed on a DynaPro MSXTC instrument (Proterion Corp., Somerset, NJ). Protein samples (1 mg/ml) were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min to remove particulates and loaded into the sample cuvette. Data were analyzed using the manufacturer's DYNAMICS software package, and the molecular mass was estimated based upon the hydrodynamic radius of the protein assuming a spherical model. Electrospray mass spectrometric analyses were performed at the Nebraska Redox Biology Center Metabolomics Core Facility of the University of Nebraska (Lincoln). Protein Expression and Purification—HpGT is expressed as an ∼60-kDa precursor that undergoes autocatalytic processing to an ∼40 kDa α-subunit and an ∼20-kDa β-subunit (Scheme 1). HpGT has been implicated as a virulence factor in colonization (3Chevalier C. Thiberge J.M. Ferrero R.L. Labigne A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1359-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 4McGovern K.J. Blanchard T.G. Gutierrez J.A. Czinn S.J. Krakowka S. Youngman P. Infect.

Di Popolo A. Blanchard T.G. Ricci V. Romano M. Zarrilli R. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the autoprocessing activity, enzymatic profile, and quaternary structure of HpGT have not been rigorously characterized. To examine these properties, we generated a prokaryotic expression vector containing the coding sequence of HpGT and overexpressed the protein in E. coli. HpGT was purified by affinity chromatography exploiting an engineered N-terminal hexahistidine tag, with typical yields of 50 mg of purified protein/liter of bacterial culture. The enzyme was >95% pure based on SDS-PAGE, and the vast majority of HpGT exhibited an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 1), corresponding to the inactive precursor. The precursor could be induced to catalytically cleave itself to produce the active heterodimer composed of an ∼40- and an ∼20-kDa subunit (Fig. 1A, lane 8). Autocatalytic Processing of HpGT—To characterize the autoprocessing of the enzyme, we monitored the conversion of precursor HpGT to its mature form as a function of time (Fig. 1). At the indicated times, an aliquot of HpGT was removed and denatured. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A), and the percent processing was plotted versus time (Fig. 1B). Under the indicated conditions, the processing of HpGT exhibited t½ = 1.73 ± 0.22 h (Table 1). Catalytic activity was also plotted as a function of processing (Fig. 1B, inset). Hydrolysis activity was strongly dependent on autocatalytic processing of the enzyme, exhibiting a nearly 1:1 relationship. Extrapolation to the completely unprocessed enzyme suggested that the uncleaved enzyme exhibited ∼7% activity. However, the uncertainty in the densitometric measurements may underestimate the extent of cleavage in the early time points. Subsequent studies of HpGT mutants (discussed below) with diminished processing activities indicated that processing is required for enzymatic activity. Thus, it is likely that the unprocessed wild-type enzyme is also completely inactive.TABLE 1Comparison of the apparent kinetic constants for HpGT and human γGTEnzymeHydrolysisTranspeptidationt½ (processing)GNA KmVmaxGNA KmVmaxμmμmol/min/mgμmμmol/min/mgHuman γGTaThe kinetic constants for human γGT were reported previously (24).

Open table in a new tab The maturation of HpGT was further characterized to gain insights into the autoprocessing reaction. To verify that maturation of HpGT is an intramolecular event, the rates of HpGT cleavage were determined over a range of protein concentrations (0.1–10 mg/ml). Comparable processing rates were observed at each protein concentration. Similarly, the addition of mature HpGT to unprocessed protein at various ratios (1:10, 1:1, and 10:1) did not impact the rate of precursor maturation (data not shown). These observations strongly support an autocatalytic intramolecular maturation mechanism. The pH dependence of HpGT processing was also examined and found to be most efficient in the neutral pH range (data not shown). Because of the inherent uncertainty in the densitometric measurements and prolonged incubation times, considerable variability in rates was observed. Most notably, reliable rates for processing could not be determined below pH 5.0 and above pH 9.0, as incomplete maturation of the enzyme was observed. At these extreme pH values, HpGT was prone to aggregation as judged by dynamic light scattering experiments. Determination of the Oligomeric State of HpGT—To examine the quaternary structure of HpGT, the apparent molecular mass of the native enzyme was determined by gel filtration (Fig. 2). Compared with molecular mass standards, mature HpGT exhibited an estimated molecular mass of ∼90 kDa, suggesting that the enzyme is either an extended heterodimer (αβ, 60 kDa) or a compact heterotetramer (α2β2, 120 kDa). To differentiate between these two possibilities, dynamic light scattering experiments were performed. Measurements of mature HpGT indicated a molecular mass between 109 and 122 kDa, suggesting that the enzyme is an α2β2-heterotetramer. Although SDS-PAGE analysis suggested equivalent concentrations of 20- and 40-kDa subunits, the possibility of an unequal combination of α- and β-subunits in the mature enzyme, such as α1β2 or α2β1, was excluded by studies with the unprocessed precursor and an HpGT mutant incapable of forming the α- and β-subunits (T380A; discussed below). Both of these proteins ran nearly identically to mature HpGT on the gel filtration column, and both had comparable molecular masses (110–120 kDa) as judged by dynamic light scattering experiments. Kinetic Characterization of HpGT—A coupled assay system was used to detect the release of glutamate from potential physiological substrates. HpGT exhibited a specific activity of 3.59 ± 0.17 μmol of glutathione hydrolyzed per min/mg of enzyme. Similar experiments were performed using glutamine as the substrate, and a comparable rate of hydrolysis (2.77 ± 0.04 μmol of glutamine hydrolyzed per min/mg of enzyme) was observed. Cleavage of the γ-glutamyl bond in both glutathione and glutamine was verified by mass spectrometry. The coupled assay system is cumbersome, and therefore, most studies of γGT have employed the substrate analog GNA. To obtain kinetic constants (Km and Vmax) for the artificial substrate, the steady-state release of 4-nitroaniline was monitored by its absorbance at 412 nm. Measurements to determine the dependence of the reaction on substrate concentration were done using purified HpGT incubated with increasing concentrations of GNA. Saturation kinetics were observed, and data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain Km and Vmax for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction (Table 1). The apparent Km for GNA was 12.5 ± 1.2 μm, an"

Mice and rats are endowed with three extra MOFEs structurally and biochemically more similar to AOX1 than to XOR. We named these proteins aldehyde oxidase homologs 1-3 (AOH1, AOH2, and AOH3).

The availability of the complete sequence of an ever increasing number of genomes provides a unique opportunity to determine the number and the structure of MOFE genes in different animal species.

Purification of Chicken Kidney AOX1 Protein, Electrophoresis, and Western Blot Analysis—Unless otherwise stated, all the purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Male chicken kidneys (75 g) were isolated and homogenized in 3 volumes of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, with a mechanical Turrax homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min to obtain cytosolic extracts. Extracts were heated at 55 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g to remove precipitated proteins. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant (40% w/v). The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The sample was applied batchwise to benzamidine-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 100 mm Tris-HCl, containing 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, and rolled overnight. After extensive washing of the phase in loading buffer, AOX1 was eluted in the same buffer containing 10 mm benzamidine. The eluate was concentrated using Centricon YM-100 ultrafiltration devices and diluted (1:10 v/v) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The material was applied to a 5:5 fast protein liquid chromatography Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The AOX1 protein was eluted at 0.5 ml/min with a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The purification of AOX1 was monitored by RAL oxidizing activity and quantitative Western blot analysis (25Kurosaki M. Terao M. Barzago M.M. Bastone A. Bernardinello D. Salmona M. Garattini E. J.

The antibodies do not cross-react with bovine XOR. 7E. Garattini and M. Terao, unpublished results. Chemiluminescent signals corresponding to AOX1 bands were quantitated with a scanning densitometer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco). The total amount of AOX1 immunoreactive protein in the various experimental samples is expressed in arbitrary units and is calculated on the basis of the intensity of the Western blot signal in OD multiplied by the total volume of each purification step. One arbitrary unit of immunoreactive protein corresponds to 1.0 OD of the specific AOX1 band in each experimental sample (25Kurosaki M. Terao M. Barzago M.M. Bastone A. Bernardinello D. Salmona M.

SDS-PAGE was performed following standard techniques (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Proteins were measured according to the Bradford method with a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad). Determination of the Chicken and Dog Cross-reactivity Profiles of Anti-bovine AOX1 Antibodies—The spectrum of crossreactivity of the anti-bovine AOX1 antibodies against chicken, dog, and mouse MOFEs was determined on extracts of COS-7 transfected with chicken AOX1, AOH, and XOR as well as dog AOH2, AOH3, and XOR full-length cDNAs. The complete coding regions of the various cDNAs were cloned in the pCMVβ plasmid expression vector (Clontech). COS-7 cells were cultured and transfected with cationic liposomes, as described previously (27Terao M. Kurosaki M. Marini M. Vanoni M.A. Saltini G. Bonetto V. Bastone A. Federico C. Saccone S.

Organs were dissected, frozen, and stored at -80 °C until processed for the determination of RAL activity. Organs were homogenized in 3 volumes (w/v) of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. Samples were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. Supernatants were collected and passed on PD10 (Amersham Biosciences) columns to eliminate endogenous NAD+. Desalted samples were incubated in 100 μl of 10mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing all-trans-retinaldehyde (Sigma) for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 100 μlof n-butanol/methanol (95:5 v/v) containing 0.005% w/v of butylated hydroxytoluene (Sigma) and was vortexed. The organic phase was separated, and an aliquot (20 μl) was loaded onto RP-18 reverse phase HPLC columns (Waters), using a Beckman apparatus equipped with a UV-visible detector (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). The retention times of all-trans-retinoic acid and all-trans-RAL were determined using authentic standards of the two compounds (Sigma). The amounts of retinoic acid were determined by integrating the area of the specific chromatographic peak and comparing it to an appropriate calibration curve. The enzymatic activity equivalent to the oxidation of 1 nmol of RAL to retinoic acid/min is defined as 1 unit. Characterization of the Purified Chicken AOX1 Protein by Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-mass spectrometric and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometric analyses of chicken AOX1 tryptic peptides were performed according to standard protocols following in gel tryptic digestion (25Kurosaki M.

Briefly, the Coomassie-stained gel slice corresponding to purified AOX1 was incubated with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 56 °C for 30 min to reduce disulfide bridges. Thiol groups were alkylated upon reaction with 55 mm iodoacetamide in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate at room temperature in the dark for 20 min. Tryptic digestion was carried out overnight at 37 °C in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 12.5 ng/μl of trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). Peptides were extracted twice in 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid. The combined extracts were lyophilized and redissolved in 0.5% formic acid and desalted using ZipTip (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Peptides were eluted in 50% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid. The eluate was mixed 1:1 (v/v) with a saturated matrix solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid 1:3 (v/v). Mass mapping of tryptic peptides was performed with a Bruker Reflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany). Data generated were processed with the Mascot program (25Kurosaki M.

The dog AOH3 cDNA was isolated as three overlapping fragments (corresponding to exons 1-15, 14-26, and 25-34) by RT-PCR from nasal mucosa RNA.

The appropriate DNA fragments were subcloned into the pCR2.1 plasmid using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced according to the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method, using double-stranded DNA as template and T7 DNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences). Oligodeoxynucleotide primers were custom synthesized by Sigma. Computer analysis of the DNA sequences was performed using the GeneWorks sequence analysis system (Intelligenetics, San Diego, CA). The nucleotide and protein sequences of the full-length chicken AOX1 and AOH, as well as dog AOH2 and AOH3 cDNAs were compared with the corresponding genomic sequences present in the NCBI public data bases. This resulted in the determination of the exon/intron structure of the corresponding genes. Determination of the 5′ and 3′ Ends of the Chicken and Dog Transcripts—Total RNA was extracted from chicken kidney (AOX1), chicken Harderian glands (AOH), dog lacrimal glands (AOH2), and dog nasal mucosa (AOH3). The poly(A+) fraction of the RNA was selected according to standard procedures (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

This 5′-RACE reaction did not require a nested protocol. The 3′-RACE was conducted as above with the following primers: chicken AOX1 SP1, 5′-TTTGCACTGAACAGCCCTCTGACT-3′ (nt 3906-3929 of the cDNA), and SP2, 5′-TGAACAAATACGAGCAGCCTGCATA-3′ (nt 3932-3956); chicken AOH SP1, 5′-GCCCAGATACATACAAGATCCCTG-3′ (nt 3742-3765), and SP2, 5′-CGGATTCGTATGGCCTGTGATGAT-3′ (nt 3975-3998); dog AOH2 SP1, 5′-GGGTGAATCTGGAATGTTCTTGGG-3′ (nt 3812-3835), and SP2, 5′-ATCTGGAATGTTCTTGGGATCCTC-3′ (nt 3818-3841); dog AOH3 SP1, 5′-TGAAGAGCCCAGCAACGCCAGAAT-3′ (nt 4055-4078), and SP2, 5′-CAGCAACGCCAGAATGGATTCGAA 3′ (nt 4064-4087). PCR products were subcloned in pCR2.1 and multiple clones were sequenced. Phylogenetic Analysis—Multiple sequence alignment was performed using the ClustalW program with default settings (Protein Gap Open Penalty, 10.0; Protein Gap Extension Penalty, 0.2; Protein matrix, Gonnet) (34Chenna R.

https://openalex.org/W2019772553,"Orbital fibroblasts orchestrate tissue remodeling in Graves disease, at least in part, because they exhibit exaggerated responses to proinflammatory cytokines. A hallmark of late stage orbital disease is vision-threatening fibrosis, the molecular basis of which remains uncertain. We report here that the Th2 cytokines, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, can induce in these cells the expression of 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) and in so doing up-regulate the production of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. IL-4 increases 15-LOX-1 protein levels through pretranslational actions. The increased steady-state 15-LOX-1 mRNA is independent of ongoing protein synthesis and involves very modestly increased gene promoter activity. Importantly, IL-4 substantially enhances 15-LOX-1 transcript stability, activity that localizes to a 293-bp sequence of the 3′-untranslated region. IL-4 activates Jak2 in orbital fibroblasts. Interrupting signaling through that pathway, either with the specific chemical inhibitor, AG490, or by transiently transfecting the cells with a Jak2 dominant negative mutant kinase, attenuates the 15-LOX-1 induction. Interferonγ, a Th1 cytokine, could block this induction by attenuating IL-4-dependent mRNA stabilization. 15-LOX-1 protein and its mRNA were undetectable in IL-4-treated dermal fibroblasts, despite comparable levels of cell surface IL-4 receptor and phosphorylated Jak2 and STAT6. Our findings suggest that orbital connective tissues may represent a site of localized 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid generation resulting from cell type-specific 15-LOX-1 mRNA stabilization by IL-4. These results may have relevance to the pathogenesis of orbital Graves disease, an inflammatory autoimmune condition that gives way to extensive fibrosis associated with a Th2 response.

These results may have relevance to the pathogenesis of orbital Graves disease, an inflammatory autoimmune condition that gives way to extensive fibrosis associated with a Th2 response. Graves disease is associated with dramatic remodeling of the orbital connective tissue and muscles, a process known as thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) 3The abbreviations used are: TAO, thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy; H(P)ETE, hydro(pero)xyeicosatetraenoic acid(s); HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; LOX, lipoxygenase(s); PGE2, prostaglandin E2; DN, dominant negative; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; UTR, untranslated region; nt, nucleotide(s); DICE, differentiation control (cis-acting) element; AU, arbitrary units. 3The abbreviations used are: TAO, thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy; H(P)ETE, hydro(pero)xyeicosatetraenoic acid(s); HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; LOX, lipoxygenase(s); PGE2, prostaglandin E2; DN, dominant negative; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; UTR, untranslated region; nt, nucleotide(s); DICE, differentiation control (cis-acting) element; AU, arbitrary units. (1Kazim M. Goldberg R.A. Smith T.J. Arch. Ophthalmol. 2002; 120: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It is an autoimmune disease that in some as yet unidentified way relates to pathology occurring in thyroid tissue. Important features of TAO include a dramatic inflammatory response and disordered accumulation of the nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan, hyaluronan. Late in the disease, inflammation abates and is followed by fibrosis (2Smith T.J. Bahn R.S. Gorman C.A. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 366-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Orbital fibroblasts become activated in TAO, probably through their interactions with T lymphocytes and mast cells trafficked to the orbit (3Prabhakar B.S. Bahn R.S. Smith T.J. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 802-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). These immunocompetent cells elaborate multiple cytokines in Graves disease. Abundant cytokines belonging to both Th1 and Th2 classes have been demonstrated in affected orbital tissues (4Hiromatsu Y. Yang D. Bednarczuk T. Miyake I. Nonaka K. Inoue Y. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Th1 responses appear to predominate early, whereas Th2 cytokines drive later stages of tissue reactivity (5Aniszewski J.P. Valyasevi R.W. Bahn R.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Th2 cytokines and the T cells from which they derive are associated with fibrosis, a hallmark of the seemingly irreversible morbidity resulting from severe TAO (1Kazim M. Goldberg R.A. Smith T.J. Arch. Ophthalmol. 2002; 120: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, may play important roles in end stage disease. With regard to TAO, nothing is currently known about the molecular targets for Th2 cytokines in the orbit that are responsible for attenuation of inflammation and provoking end stage tissue remodeling, including fibrosis. Identification of the proximate mechanisms involved in these changes could yield therapeutic strategies directed at preserving sight. Moreover, they may also have important implications for the tissue remodeling occurring in other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Lipoxygenases (LOX) are a family of lipid-peroxidizing enzymes that oxygenate polyunsaturated fatty acids to specific hydroperoxy derivatives (6Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.-E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar); arachidonic acid is converted to distinct hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HPETE). There are two human 15-LOX (EC 1.13.11.33) genes, 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 (7Sigal E. Grunberger D. Cashman J.R. Craik C.S. Caughey G.H. Nadel J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochem. 1999; 266: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), each possessing a distinct profile of tissue expression and catalytic activities. 15-LOX-1 generates 12-HPETE as well as 15-HPETE from arachidonic acid, whereas 15-LOX-2 forms purely 15-HPETE (11Bryant R.W. Bailey J.M. Schewe T. Rapoport S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6050-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 15-LOX-1 is expressed in reticulocytes, eosinophils, macrophages, and monocytes (8Conrad D.J. Kuhn H. Mulkins M. Highland E. Sigal E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In reticulocytes from anemic animals, this enzyme mediates mitochondrial disruption during differentiation (12Rapoport S.M. Schewe T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 471-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The distribution of 15-LOX-2 appears restricted to certain epithelial cell types, including those of the hair root, skin, prostate, lung, and cornea (9Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). There is evidence that 15-LOX-2 functions as a negative regulator of cell cycle progression in normal prostate epithelium (13Tang S. Bhatia B. Maldonado C.J. Yang P. Newman R.A. Liu J. Chandra D. Traag J. Klein R.D. Fischer S.M. Chopra D. Shen J. Zhau H.E. Chung L.W.K. Tang D.G. J. Biol.

Boeglin W.E. Olson S.J. Kasper S. Brash A.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 235-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). 15-LOX-1 can oxidize biomembranes, and because these activities profoundly disrupt cellular function, its expression must be tightly regulated. In developing reticulocytes, 15-LOX-1 mRNA exhibits translational silence until the final stages, despite its high relative abundance (15Thiele B.J. Andree H. Hohne M. Rapoport S.M. Acta Biol. Med. Germanica. 1981; 40: 597-602PubMed Google Scholar). IL-4 and IL-13 have been shown to up-regulate 15-LOX-1 expression in several mammalian cell types, including those of the fibroblast lineage derived from the synovial membrane and lung (16Liagre B. Vergne P. Rigaud M. Beneytout J.L. J. Rheumatol. 1999; 26: 1044-1051PubMed Google Scholar, 17Harada S. Sugiyama E. Takebe S. Taki H. Shinoda K. Mohamed S.G. Maruyama M. Hamazaki T. Kobayashi M. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 2003; 21: 753-758PubMed Google Scholar). It may be in part through their up-regulation of 15-LOX-1 that the anti-inflammatory activities of Th2 cytokines exert their influence on tissue activation and remodeling (18Spanbroek R. Hildner M. Kohler A. Muller A. Zintl F. Kuhn H. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Habenicht A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5152-5157Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Many of these actions in connective tissues are thought to be mediated by resident fibroblasts. Orbital fibroblasts exhibit attributes that set them apart from those derived from other connective tissue depots (19Smith T.J. Autoimmunity. 2003; 36: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). They possess a distinctive morphology (20Smith T.J. Bahn R.S. Gorman C.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Phipps R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the vulnerability of orbital connective tissue to Graves disease is a direct result of the unique attributes of its resident fibroblasts (19Smith T.J. Autoimmunity. 2003; 36: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When orbital fibroblasts are activated by proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, leukoregulin, or CD154, they generate extraordinarily high levels of PGE2 (26Wang H.-S. Cao H.J. Winn V.D. Rezanka L.J. Frobert Y. Evans C.H. Sciaky D. Young D.A. Smith T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22718-22728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 27Han R. Tsui S. Smith T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16355-16364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This results from the coordinate induction of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase, the inflammatory cyclooxygenase, and microsomal PGE2 synthase (27Han R. Tsui S. Smith T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16355-16364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In the setting of inflammation, PGE2 conditions tissues to the actions of other factors and can alter the balance between Th1 and Th2, favoring the formation of the latter cytokines (28Li T.K. Fox B.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1680-1690PubMed Google Scholar, 29Betz M. Fox B.S. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 108-113PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, cells that generate particularly high levels of PGE2 exert an important influence over qualitative aspects of tissue remodeling and potentially promote profibrotic events. Other ecosanoid synthetic pathways have yet to be characterized in orbital fibroblasts. The actions of their products, like those of PGE2, can represent critical determinants of the immune response. Synthetic products of lipoxygenases have been insinuated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and allergic responses and autoimmune diseases (6Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.-E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar, 30Samuelsson B. Science. 1983; 220: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (2307) Google Scholar). Their potential roles in Graves disease and TAO have not been examined previously. We now report that IL-4 and IL-13 can up-regulate 15-LOX-1 expression in orbital fibroblasts from patients with severe TAO. This induction is the consequence of increased steady-state 15-LOX-1 mRNA levels and appears to be mediated through the Jak2/STAT6 signal transduction pathway. Unlike previous examples of IL-4-induced 15-LOX-1 expression that involve large increases in gene transcription, those reported here result from modest increases in gene promoter activity and substantially enhanced mRNA stability. Our results suggest that Th2 cytokines can activate an important component of the immunomodulatory machinery in orbital fibroblasts in an anatomic site- and disease-selective manner. They suggest a heretofore unrecognized action of IL-4 in orbital connective tissue that could underlie the Th2-driven manifestations of late stage TAO. Materials—Dexamethasone (1,4-pregnadien-9-fluoro-16α-methyl-11β,17α,21-triol-3,20-dione), 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole, arachidonate, and cycloheximide were from Sigma. IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, IL-13, interferon γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α were purchased from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). AG490 was supplied by Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The plasmid containing a dominant negative (DN) mutant expression vector for Jak2 was generously provided by Dr. David E. Levy (New York University). 15-LOX-1 cDNA was from Oxford Biomedical Research (Oxford, MI). mAbs directed against human 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 were purchased from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI). Pan-Abs and phosphorylated protein-specific Abs against Jak2, STAT6, and Tyk2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) or Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Anti-IL-4 receptor Abs were from BD Biosciences. Cell Culture—Orbital fibroblast strains were initiated from tissue explants obtained as surgical waste during decompression surgery for severe TAO. Other strains were generated from normal appearing orbital tissues from patients undergoing surgery for eye diseases not involving the orbit. The Institutional Review Boards of the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and Research and Education Institute and the UCLA Center for Health Sciences have approved these activities. Dermal fibroblasts were generated from punch biopsies of normal appearing skin or were purchased from the American Type Tissue Collection (Manassas, VA). Tissue fragments were generated by mechanical disruption of explants, and fibroblasts were then allowed to adhere to plastic culture plates. They were covered with Eagle's medium to which 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine (435 μg/ml), and penicillin/streptomycin were added, as described previously (31Smith T.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1493-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Monolayers were disrupted by gentle treatment with trypsin/EDTA. Medium was changed every 3–4 days, and cultures were maintained in a 5% CO2, humidified incubator at 37 °C. Strains were utilized between the second and 12th passage. All experimental manipulations were conducted after a state of confluence had been reached. We have already characterized these cultures extensively (32Smith T.J. Koumas L. Gagnon A. Bell A. Sempowski G.D. Phipps R.P. Sorisky A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We found them to be essentially devoid of contamination with endothelial, epithelial, and smooth muscle cells. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Hybridization and mRNA Stability Assays—Fibroblasts were cultivated in 100-mm diameter plates to a confluent state and were then treated with the test agents specified in the figure legends. Cellular RNA was extracted from rinsed monolayers by the method of Chomcynski and Sacchi (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar) with an RNA-isolating system purchased from Biotecx (Houston, TX). The nucleic acid was subjected to electrophoresis through denaturing 1% agarose, formaldehyde gels. Purity and integrity of the RNA were established by determining the 260/280 spectroscopic ratios and by staining electrophoresed samples with ethidium bromide and inspecting them under UV light. The RNA was transferred to Zeta-probe membrane (Bio-Rad), and immobilized samples were hybridized with [32P]dCTP-labeled 15-LOX-1 cDNA probes generated by the random primer method. Hybridization was conducted in ExpressHyb solution (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) at 68 °C for 1 h. Membranes were washed under high stringency conditions, and then the RNA/DNA hybrids were visualized by autoradiography on X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.) following exposure using intensifier screens at –70 °C. Bands resulting from radioactive hybrids were scanned by densitometry. Membranes were then stripped according to the manufacturer's instructions. They were rehybridized with a GAPDH cDNA probe, and band densities were normalized to this signal. In mRNA stabilization studies, cultures were pretreated with IL-4 (10 ng/ml) for 12 h. They were then rinsed extensively and treated without or with IL-4 for the times indicated along the abscissas in Fig. 7, A and B, in the presence of 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole (20 μg/ml). Cellular RNA was isolated using a Qiagen (Valencia, CA) RNeasy Kit. Total RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) at room temperature for 15 min. RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed with an Omniscript reverse transcription kit (Qiagen) using oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen). cDNA was quantified with the SYBR green PCR kit (Qiagen) using real time PCR (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primers used were forward 5′-CCCTGGAAATTAACGTCCGG-3′ and reverse 5′-TCCCAGAGCCGCAGCGCATC-3′. In other mRNA stability studies, RNA was subjected to Northern blot analysis. In both studies, data were normalized to their respective GAPDH concentrations. HPLC Analysis—Frozen fibroblast and monocyte pellets were thawed on ice in 100 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris with 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). The cells were then homogenized by sonication for 5 s using the microprobe of a VirSonic 100 (Virtis Inc., Gardiner, NY) ultrasonicator at setting 6. Incubations using 50 μl of the sonicated cells were begun by the addition of 100 μm [1-14C]arachidonic acid (final concentration) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 0.5 μl of ethanol (1% final volume). Samples were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with continual agitation and terminated by the addition of 2.5 volumes of cold methanol. Following the addition of 1.25 volumes of dichloromethane and thorough mixing, samples were centrifuged to remove protein precipitates, and products were recovered in the mixed phase of methanol/water/dichloromethane. Samples were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen to remove most of the dichloromethane and methanol, water was added, and the products were extracted using a 1-ml C18 Waters Oasis cartridge. These materials were washed with water and eluted with 1 ml of MeOH. Extracts were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC using a Waters Symmetry 5 μm C18 column (25 × 0.46 cm) with a solvent of methanol/water/glacial acetic acid 80:20:0.01 (by volume) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (retention time of 15-HETE ∼16.5 min). Unlabeled HETEs (100 ng each of 5-, 8-, 9-, 11-, 12-, and 15-HETEs) were added to each sample prior to HPLC analysis; this permitted an exact determination of the retention times of each HETE product within individual chromatographic runs. UV spectra and the profiles at 205, 220, 235, and 270 nm were recorded using a Hewlett-Packard 1040A diode array detector, and radioactivity was monitored on-line using a Radiomatic Instruments Flo-One detector. Western Blot Analysis of Fibroblast Proteins—Cellular proteins were solubilized from rinsed fibroblast monolayers following the treatments indicated in the figure legends. The ice-cold harvest buffer contained 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were taken up in Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Primary Abs directed against human 15-LOX-1 were utilized for the detection of this enzyme. Membranes were incubated with the Abs overnight at 4 °C. Following washes, membranes were incubated with the secondary Ab for 1 h at room temperature. The ECL (Amersham Biosciences) chemiluminescence detection system was used to generate signals, and the resulting bands were analyzed with a densitometer. With regard to assessing the activation of Jak2 and STAT6 kinases, cell lysates from untreated orbital fibroblast cultures and those treated with IL-4 (10 ng/ml) were subjected to SDS-PAGE; the proteins were transferred to membrane and then probed with pan-Abs and phosphospecific Abs against the two kinases. Transient Transfection of Orbital Fibroblasts with Plasmids Containing DN Mutant Jak2, 15-LOX-1 Gene Promoter, or 3′-UTR Fragments—15-LOX-1 gene promoter studies involved cloning a 338-bp fragment spanning nt –361 to –23 using the Human Gene Walker kit (Clontech), according to instructions from the manufacturer. The two primers used for the PCRs include the forward sequence 5′-TTAAAGGTACCGTGGTACACACGTGC-3′ and reverse sequence 5′-TTTAACCCAAGCTTCTGGTGGAGAAGAAGGGTGG-3′. Another, longer, 1025-bp fragment spanning –1045 to –20 nt relative to the transcriptional start site was cloned using the forward primer 5′-GAGTGAGACTCTATATCTCA-3′ and reverse 5′-CTCCTTCTGGTGGAGAAGAAG-3′. The amplified fragment was sequenced and subcloned from pCR2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen) into a promoterless pGl2-luciferase reporter vector (Promega). A 293-bp fragment of the 3′-UTR spanning nt +2361 to +2653 was generated with the forward primer 5′-TTGTTGTTGTTAAGACAGAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CAGTCCTAGTTCTTTTCCATC-3′. The fragment was cloned into the XbaI site downstream from the luciferase reporter gene in the pGL3 promoter vector (Promega). Transcription of this construct is driven by a SV40 promoter. To transiently transfect fibroblasts, cultures were allowed to proliferate to 80–90% confluence in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Constructs were transfected using the Lipofectamine PLUS system (Invitrogen). 0.75 μg of pGL2 promoter DNA and 0.1 μg of pRL-TK vector DNA (Promega), serving as a transfection efficiency control, were mixed with PLUS reagent for 15 min before being combined with Lipofectamine for another 15 min. The DNA-lipid mixture was added to culture medium for 3 h at 37 °C. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum replaced the transfection mixture overnight. Transfected cultures were then serum-starved, and some received either IL-4 (10 ng/ml) for 2 h or nothing (control) as indicated. Cellular material was harvested in buffer provided by the manufacturer (Promega) and stored at –80 °C until assayed. Luciferase activity was monitored with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) in an FB12 tube luminometer (Zylux). Values were normalized to internal controls, and each experiment was performed at least three times. To interrupt the expression of potentially relevant signaling pathway components, the DN mutant kinase construct for Jak2 was ligated into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). This was transiently transfected into cells as described above. Control cultures received a constant amount (2 μg) of empty vector DNA. Diminished levels of the kinases were documented by Western blotting an aliquot of the lysate with relevant antibodies. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Surface IL-4 Receptor Display—Fibroblasts were harvested by subjecting monolayers to gentle mechanical disruption, placing the cells in polypropylene tubes, and incubating for 20 min on ice with fluorochrome-conjugated mAbs (1 μg/106 cells). Cells were washed twice with staining buffer (phosphate-buffered saline and 4% bovine serum) and analyzed immediately. Analysis was performed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Mean fluorescent intensity was calculated as a ratio of mean fluorescence sample/isotype fluorescence. Statistics—Data are generally expressed as the mean ± range of duplicates or mean ± S.D. of three or more determinations. Significance was determined using Student's t test. IL-4 and IL-13 Induce the Expression of 15-LOX-1 in Orbital Fibroblasts—When orbital fibroblasts, in this case derived from a patient with TAO, were treated with IL-4 (10 ng/ml), 15-LOX-1 protein was induced in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). The protein was undetectable in untreated fibroblasts, and the effect of IL-4 was first detected following 16 h of treatment. Maximal up-regulation occurred at 72 h, the duration of the study. In a total of three separate experiments, 15-LOX-1 protein was enhanced 68.4 ± 0.5-fold after 72 h (mean ± S.D., p < 0.05 versus control). IL-13 (10 ng/ml) also induced 15-LOX-1 protein expression (70 ± 2.5-fold at 72 h, p < 0.05 versus control) (Fig. 1B). In contrast, 5- and 12-LOX remained undetectable following treatment of the TAO orbital fibroblasts with either IL-4 or IL-13 (data not shown). The effects of IL-4 were concentration-dependent (Fig. 1C). Low level expression was observed at a cytokine concentration of 0.1 ng/ml (the lowest tested), and a nearly maximal effect was observed at 0.5 ng/ml. Higher concentrations of IL-4 (up to 10 ng/ml) failed to induce 15-LOX-1 further. In contrast to 15-LOX-1, 15-LOX-2 protein was constitutively expressed, albeit at low levels in TAO orbital fibroblasts (Fig. 1D). The levels of this protein were unaffected by IL-4 treatment up to 72 h, the duration of the study. 15-LOX-1 protein could be induced in multiple orbital fibroblast strains, each from a different donor with TAO. All four strains examined were found to exhibit substantial induction after 72 h of treatment with IL-4 (10 ng/ml) (9.85 ± 1.81-fold above controls, p < 0.0005) (Fig. 2, A and C). In contrast, either extremely low or undetectable levels of expression were observed in three orbital fibroblast strains, each from a different donor without Graves disease following IL-4 treatment (p < 0.005 versus TAO orbital fibroblasts) (Fig. 2, B and C). No 15-LOX-1 protein induction could be detected in two strains of dermal fibroblasts harvested from normal appearing skin (Fig. 2B). Thus, it would appear that the induction of 15-LOX-1 by IL-4 is anatomic site-restricted to orbital fibroblasts derived from patients with TAO. Glucocorticoid steroids exert broad anti-inflammatory effects and profoundly attenuate prostaglandin generation in IL-1β-treated orbital fibroblasts (26Wang H.-S. Cao H.J. Winn V.D. Rezanka L.J.

Dexamethasone (10 nm), a specific, synthetic glucocorticoid, blocked the induction of 15-LOX-1 by IL-4 (IL-4, 3.13 ± 0.32-fold (mean ± range) greater than IL-4 plus dexamethasone) (Fig. 3A). A similar blockade was noted with regard to the induction by IL-13. Moreover, this action may be at least partially mediated by decreasing levels of 15-LOX-1 mRNA (see Fig. 5B). Often, Th1 cytokines oppose the actions of Th2 molecules. We thus determined the impact of interferon γ, a Th1 cytokine, on IL-4 and IL-13 effects and found that it could block the induction of 15-LOX-1 by both Th2 cytokines (IL-4, 8.13 ± 0.4-fold greater than IL-4 plus interferon γ (Fig. 3B)). A number of other cytokines were tested for their ability to induce 15-LOX-1. IL-5, IL-1β, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor-α (10 ng/ml in every case) failed to induce the protein (data not shown). Thus, the expression of cyto"

We investigated in monkey whether orienting saccadic gaze shifts made in the dark with coordinated eye-head movements are controlled by feedback. We recorded from superior colliculus fixation neurons (SCFNs) that fired tonically during fixation and were silent during gaze shifts. When we briefly (≤700 ms) interrupted gaze shifts by transiently braking head movements, SCFNs fired steadily during brake-induced gaze immobility, and their mean frequency was inversely related to the remaining distance between current gaze position and the target. After head release, a corrective gaze saccade brought gaze on the unseen goal, and SCFN firing frequency peaked. The results support gaze feedback control and show that the SC is part of a network that encodes, during orientation, the distance between eye and target, irrespective of gaze trajectory characteristics.

We routinely scan our visual surrounds using coordinated eye and head movements that generate rapid displacements of the visual axis in space (Figure 1B). Although such gaze saccades require the coordination of two mobile segments—the head and eyes—their accuracy is comparable to that of eye saccades made with the head fixed (Laurutis and Robinson, 1986Laurutis V.P.

On-line compensation of gaze shifts perturbed by micro-stimulation of the superior colliculus in the cat with unrestrained head.Exp. Brain Res. 1995; 106: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that gaze saccades are controlled by a feedback loop that computes gaze position error (GPE) = final − current gaze positions (reviewed in Guitton et al., 2004Guitton D. Bergeron A. Choi W.Y. On the role of subcortical feedback mechanisms in the control of head-unrestrained gaze saccades.in: Hall W.C. Moschovakis A. The Superior Colliculus: New Approaches for Studying Sensorimotor Integration. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2004: 241-275Google Scholar). Feedback assures accuracy by driving gaze saccades until GPE is zero, a process that can compensate for variability, or “noise,” in the positions of the individual eye-in-head and head-on-body platforms. This concept is analogous to the classic brainstem “local feedback loop” thought to control saccadic eye movements in the head-fixed monkey (reviewed in Scudder et al., 2002Scudder C.A. Kaneko C.R. Fuchs A.F. The brainstem burst generator for saccadic eye movements: a modern synthesis.Exp. Brain Res. 2002; 142: 439-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Although the “local feedback loop” is well accepted, the gaze feedback hypothesis is controversial. A competing model (Sparks, 1999Sparks D.L. Conceptual issues related to the role of the superior colliculus in the control of gaze.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, Freedman, 2001Freedman E.G. Interactions between eye and head control signals can account for movement kinematics.Biol. Cybern. 2001; 84: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), using no gaze feedback, proposes that a gaze displacement command is decomposed into separate eye and head displacement commands that drive separate eye and head generators, each controlled by its own feedback circuit. In this model, there is no explicit calculation of GPE: gaze accuracy is implemented, using parameter adjustments that assure that, at the end of the eye saccade, the sum of the overall eye and head displacements is equal to the desired gaze displacement. How the putative gaze feedback loop is implemented neurally is unknown. The superior colliculus (SC) of the midbrain, a structure critical to saccade control and closely linked to brainstem circuits, has been considered a prime candidate for this function. The SC contains a motor map that is topographically organized in retinal coordinates (Klier et al., 2001Klier E.M. Wang H. Crawford J.D. The superior colliculus encodes gaze commands in retinal coordinates.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and the position on the motor map, of an ensemble of bursting neurons, encodes a specific gaze saccade vector (cat: Munoz et al., 1991Munoz D.P. Guitton D. Pelisson D. Control of orienting gaze shifts by the tectoreticulospinal system in the head-free cat. III. Spatiotemporal characteristics of phasic motor discharges.J.

In the cat, evidence indicates that the SC lies within the gaze feedback loop and encodes GPE (Munoz et al., 1991Munoz D.P. Guitton D. Pelisson D.

Whether the SC of monkey also encodes GPE, or whether it operates open loop, are important and contentious problems (reviewed in Keller, 2004Keller E.L.

CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2004: 303-318Google Scholar) whose clarification is imperative for understanding human gaze control. Virtually all models of the SC have been based on studies in the head-fixed monkey whose SC has been hypothesized to control saccades: (1) open loop, with intrinsic mechanisms that terminate the SC burst after a fixed, position-specific number of spikes have been emitted; (2) open loop with a downstream counter that stops saccades after receiving a fixed number of spikes—dependent on the location of the active site on the motor map—irrespective of whether or not SC activity continues (electrical stimulation head fixed favors this model); or (3) within a loop whose feedback signal either stops SC activity at saccade end or permits the SC to encode an eye motor error, analogous to GPE. Despite the fact that open-loop models of eye saccade control in the head-fixed monkey have excellent predictive capabilities, the reality is that anatomical substrates do exist for feedback to the primate SC's motor map via projections from subcortical eye and/or head movement-related areas such as the fastigial nucleus, the mesencephalic reticular formation, the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, the zona incerta, and the nucleus intercalates (reviewed in Guitton et al., 2004Guitton D. Bergeron A. Choi W.Y. On the role of subcortical feedback mechanisms in the control of head-unrestrained gaze saccades.in: Hall W.C. Moschovakis A.

Highstein S.M. The microscopic anatomy and physiology of the mammalian saccadic system.Prog. Neurobiol. 1996; 50: 133-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Such projections could modulate SC discharges during gaze shifts. Here, we propose that studying SC discharges during perturbed gaze shifts in the head-unrestrained monkey can generate new insights into two important questions in gaze control (Sparks, 2004Sparks D.L. Commands for coordinated eye and head movements in the primate superior colliculus.in: Hall W.C. Moschovakis A. The Superior Colliculus: New Approaches for Studying Sensorimotor Integration. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2004: 303-318Google Scholar): whether primate head-unrestrained gaze shifts are controlled by a feedback loop and whether the SC, in this condition, receives gaze feedback signals. Two groups of observations support the latter proposition. First, there is considerable evidence supporting gaze feedback control in cat via the existence of GPE-related discharges in its SC. Feedback to the SC in this species may adjust the collicular output to compensate for altered head plant characteristics (Coimbra et al., 2000Coimbra A.J. Lefevre P. Missal M. Olivier E. Difference between visually and electrically evoked gaze saccades disclosed by altering the head moment of inertia.J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 1103-1107PubMed Google Scholar). Second, gaze shift velocity and duration in humans can be controlled voluntarily by controlling head velocity (Guitton and Volle, 1987Guitton D. Volle M. Gaze control in humans: eye-head coordination during orienting movements to targets within and beyond the oculomotor range.J. Neurophysiol. 1987; 58: 427-459PubMed Google Scholar). Given that the discharge of collicular neurons, with strong motor-related activity, ceases synchronously with gaze shift end (Freedman and Sparks, 1997bFreedman E.G. Sparks D.L. Activity of cells in the deeper layers of the superior colliculus of the rhesus monkey: evidence for a gaze displacement command.J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 1669-1690PubMed Google Scholar) it follows that, if the SC were to command downstream structures open loop, a subject who wishes to control gaze shift duration would have to be able to control voluntarily the duration of the SC burst discharge. But a head-fixed subject cannot control voluntarily either eye saccade velocity or duration, suggesting the lack of voluntary control on the SC in this condition. It is unlikely that SC burst discharges can be controlled voluntarily when the head is unrestrained, but not when the head is fixed. A parsimonious hypothesis is that a head-unrestrained subject can control voluntarily the head movement component of a gaze shift, but not the SC discharge, and that it is gaze feedback to the SC that modulates and stops the discharge at gaze shift end. Here, we propose that the problem of gaze feedback control is amenable to experimental study more easily in the head-unrestrained than in the head-fixed condition. Eye saccades are neither subjected to voluntary control of the trajectory nor perturbed in real life. Gaze shifts are and perturbed gaze shifts can be studied in the laboratory (Guitton and Volle, 1987Guitton D. Volle M.

Neurosci., abstract) by mechanically braking head movements, a procedure that mimics the natural occurrence, particularly in contact sports, of variable transient loads to the head. We chose to begin our study of the effects of head trajectory perturbations on collicular cells by studying SC fixation neurons (SCFNs) (Munoz and Guitton, 1991Munoz D.P. Guitton D. Control of orienting gaze shifts by the tectoreticulospinal system in the head-free cat. II. Sustained discharges during motor preparation and fixation.J.

Neurophysiol. 1993; 70: 559-575PubMed Google Scholar). These cells are linked anatomically to the motor map and may reflect neural discharges there (Munoz and Istvan, 1998Munoz D.P. Istvan P.J. Lateral inhibitory interactions in the intermediate layers of the monkey superior colliculus.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 1193-1209PubMed Google Scholar, Takahashi et al., 2005Takahashi M. Sugiuchi Y.

Neurophysiol. 2005; 94: 1707-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The discharge characteristics of SCFNs are potentially simpler to interpret than those of cells on the motor map for three reasons: (1) SCFNs have a relatively “simple” discharge pattern in that they fire tonically during attentive fixation and they pause during multidirectional large eye saccades in the head-fixed monkey (Munoz and Wurtz, 1993aMunoz D.P. Wurtz R.H. Fixation cells in monkey superior colliculus. I. Characteristics of cell discharge.J. Neurophysiol. 1993; 70: 559-575PubMed Google Scholar) and, as we will show here, horizontal gaze saccades in the head-free monkey. (2) Their discharges can be compared to those in cat, whose SCFNs encode GPE during gaze saccades (Bergeron and Guitton, 2000Bergeron A. Guitton D. Fixation neurons in the superior colliculus encode distance between current and desired gaze positions.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). (3) SCFNs are located in a restricted zone within the rostral SC, thereby obviating the need to interpret potential perturbation-linked changes in the spatiotemporal pattern of collicular activity on the motor map. Here, we provide strong support for the gaze feedback hypothesis by demonstrating that SCFNs in the head-unrestrained monkey are informed that a gaze shift has ended (i.e., GPE = 0), even after gaze is completely and unpredictably halted for almost 1 s, and that these cells carry a signal encoding GPE. Brief presentation of the present results was made in W.Y. Choi and D. Guitton, 2004, Soc. Neurosci., abstract. We studied head-unrestrained gaze shifts made, in the dark, by two monkeys to the remembered location of a previously flashed target on the horizontal plane (Figures 1A and 1B). We recorded in the SC while head movements were unexpectedly and briefly halted for variable times beginning just after head movement onset (Experimental Procedures). Target positions varied from 10° to 60° contralateral to the recording sites, and additional randomization was implemented by varying the temporal features of the fixation point and target presentations and, in brake trials, the temporal characteristics of the head brake. Here, we describe SCFN discharges during control gaze shifts in the amplitude range 10°–60°. However, for perturbed gaze shifts, we restrict our report to the results of braking 50°–60° gaze shifts because for these large-amplitude gaze displacements, head brakes caused important trajectory perturbations. Figure 1B shows a control 50° gaze (G) saccade that displaced gaze from 30° to the right of body-centered space to 20° to the left. During this leftward 50° gaze saccade, a 30° eye (E) saccade brought the eye from an initial position in the head, ∼20° to the right of the center of the orbit, to a final position, ∼10° to the left. The eye remained stable at this position for about 70 ms until gaze saccade end. During this 70 ms period of eye immobilization, the gaze shift was carried by the ongoing head motion (H). On average, for our two monkeys, the postsaccade final orbital eye position was ∼15°, which is well within the oculomotor range (Guitton and Volle, 1987Guitton D. Volle M. Gaze control in humans: eye-head coordination during orienting movements to targets within and beyond the oculomotor range.J. Neurophysiol. 1987; 58: 427-459PubMed Google Scholar, Freedman and Sparks, 1997aFreedman E.G. Sparks D.L. Eye-head coordination during head-unrestrained gaze shifts in rhesus monkeys.J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 2328-2348PubMed Google Scholar) and is similar to the 10°–20° range reported in the study of head-unrestrained gaze shift in the monkey (Freedman and Sparks, 1997aFreedman E.G. Sparks D.L. Eye-head coordination during head-unrestrained gaze shifts in rhesus monkeys.J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 2328-2348PubMed Google Scholar). After the gaze saccade ended, the action of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) moved the eyes opposite to ongoing head motion, thereby stabilizing gaze in space. A brief (∼50 ms) head brake near the start of a head movement resulted in a transient perturbation to the gaze trajectory (Figure 1C) in which gaze velocity decreased, but not to zero. A longer (∼200 ms) brake resulted in complete interruption of the intended gaze trajectory (Figure 1D), the main type of perturbed trajectory that we will study here. In this typical example of an intended leftward 50° gaze shift, braking resulted in an initial eye saccade whose amplitude, ∼35°, landed the eye well within the oculomotor range at about 15° to the left of orbital center (cf. Figure 1B). This initial saccade was followed by a “gaze plateau” during which the visual axis was immobile relative to space. Prolongation of the gaze plateau after head release was due to the action of the VOR that moved the eyes opposite to head motion. In the example of Figure 1D, the gaze plateau was terminated by an eye saccade that, together with ongoing head motion, generated a 15° corrective gaze saccade that brought gaze, in the dark, to the remembered location of the target. Across all experiments, 95% of the plateau durations varied between 45 ms and 650 ms: mean, 250 ± 138 ms (SD); median, 229 ms. The duration of the plateau phase depended on three quantities: brake duration, duration of the first saccade, and the time between brake offset (head release) and when the corrective eye saccade was generated. The onset and offset of a head brake did not correspond to the onset and offset, respectively, of a gaze plateau. Note that, even for the longest head brakes, the monkeys never generated a corrective—or any saccade—before the head was released. The distribution of time between head release and onset of the corrective gaze saccade for all trials was skewed with the peak closer to brake offset: mean, 155 ± 148 ms; median, 93 ms. Figure 1E shows nine gaze trajectories, selected from our large sample to have the same distance between gaze plateau position and final goal (i.e., same plateau GPE), and the same plateau duration. It is clear from these examples that the same corrective gaze saccade can result from the sum of many different eye and head trajectories. In particular, final gaze position can be relatively invariant despite important differences at that time in the orbital eye position and the concurrent position of the accompanying head movement. In agreement with prior studies (Guitton et al., 1984Guitton D. Douglas R.M. Volle M. Eye-head coordination in cats.J. Neurophysiol. 1984; 52: 1030-1050PubMed Google Scholar, Laurutis and Robinson, 1986Laurutis V.P. Robinson D.A. The vestibulo-ocular reflex during human saccadic eye movements.J.

On the role of subcortical feedback mechanisms in the control of head-unrestrained gaze saccades.in: Hall W.C. Moschovakis A. The Superior Colliculus: New Approaches for Studying Sensorimotor Integration. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2004: 241-275Google Scholar), gaze accuracy in the perturbation trials was comparable to control. Figure 1G shows the performance of monkey M1. For large gaze shifts between 50° and 60°, which required an important head contribution, there was no significant difference between the mean gaze endpoints in control and brake trials (p > 0.5, Student's t test). For monkey M2, there was no significant difference for targets at 50°, but there was for targets at 60° (p = 0.007, Student's t test). Nevertheless, in the latter, the difference between control and perturbed gaze endpoints was less than 1.6°. Occasionally, in only about 3% of trials, the monkey did not generate a corrective gaze saccade after head release, and the gaze trace remained flat, short of the target location, until the end of the “aborted” trial (Figure 1F). Such aborted trials were not included in the calculation of mean accuracy. Note that a model structure that posits accurate gaze control, without the use of gaze feedback, cannot explain the accuracy of the type of perturbed gaze shift shown in Figures 1D and 1E. An important reason is that, when the head was released, the eyes were driven backward in the orbit—to a position quite different than their end position after the first saccade. The orbital position of the eye at the beginning of the corrective eye saccade, as well as the velocity and amplitude of the eye saccade, were very variable and furthermore had to sum with a variable head trajectory. We know that the head velocity signal, carried by the VOR pathway, is reduced during large gaze shifts (e.g., Roy and Cullen, 1998Roy J.E. Cullen K.E. A neural correlate for vestibulo-ocular reflex suppression during voluntary eye-head gaze shifts.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar; reviewed in Guitton et al., 2004Guitton D. Bergeron A. Choi W.Y. On the role of subcortical feedback mechanisms in the control of head-unrestrained gaze saccades.in: Hall W.C. Moschovakis A. The Superior Colliculus: New Approaches for Studying Sensorimotor Integration. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2004: 241-275Google Scholar). However, we do not know the status of this signal during corrective gaze saccades. If the head velocity signal is attenuated, to terminate the corrective gaze saccade accurately, it is necessary to know GPE online, which the gaze feedback model implements by definition. If it is not attenuated, to explain accurate gaze control it is necessary to know plateau GPE, which gaze feedback also provides. By comparison, advocates of the no gaze feedback model must assume that (1) the current motor command is aborted, and (2) GPE is calculated “offline” and a new corrective gaze saccade is generated. The discharge characteristics of SCFNs, to be described below, indicate that the latter interpretation is not applicable. We recorded first from a SCFN when the monkey's head was unrestrained. If sufficient trials were obtained and contact with the cell was still available, we recorded in the head-fixed condition. We obtained data from three cells in monkey M1 in the latter condition. Nineteen SCFNs—14 in monkey M1, five in monkey M2—remained isolated long enough during the head brake trials, in the head-unrestrained condition, to obtain sufficient data to analyze the effects of gaze shift perturbations on cell discharges and compare this to the firing frequency pattern in control gaze shifts. In control trials, SCFNs typified by cell M1-02 (Figure 2A) were tonically active while the monkey looked at the fixation point (FP) in the period prior to its extinction and the subsequent orienting gaze shift to the target. This is a characteristic property of fixation cells (Munoz and Wurtz, 1993aMunoz D.P. Wurtz R.H. Fixation cells in monkey superior colliculus. I. Characteristics of cell discharge.J. Neurophysiol. 1993; 70: 559-575PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we will refer to the firing frequency, associated with fixation of FP, as the “fixation activity.” Preceding the onset of control gaze shifts, the firing frequency declined below the fixation activity, and at gaze shift start the cell was almost silent (Figure 2A). Aligning control trajectories on gaze-shift start and end revealed that the duration of the period of low SCFN firing frequency increased as the duration of control gaze shifts increased (Figures 2A and 2C), and at gaze shift end, in the dark, the fixation activity returned to the pregaze shift level. This is analogous to the “pause” in the tonic fixation activity during eye saccades in the head-fixed monkey (Munoz and Wurtz, 1993aMunoz D.P. Wurtz R.H. Fixation cells in monkey superior colliculus. I. Characteristics of cell discharge.J. Neurophysiol. 1993; 70: 559-575PubMed Google Scholar). For this example cell, the fixation firing frequency, 65 ± 15 Hz (SD), measured in the 200 ms period about 400–200 ms before gaze shift start (before activity declined preceding control gaze shift onset), was not significantly different from the 63 ± 13 Hz measured in the 200 ms period beginning 50 ms after gaze shift end (GPE = 0) (p = 0.47, Student's t test). (We did not measure the mean in a period beginning immediately at gaze shift end because mean firing frequency kept rising for about 50 ms after GPE = 0). Note that the reactivation pattern at control gaze shift end varied from cell to cell, as we shall show in subsequent examples. We will present the population characteristics in a subsequent section. Figure 2E emphasizes that the pause in SCFN tonic firing was gaze related. At the top are the gaze (G), head (H), and eye (E) trajectories for a 50° control gaze shift, typical of those selected to form the raster plot below. A 35° eye saccade brought the eye from an initial position in the head of ∼20° to the right, to a final position (left vertical dotted line) ∼15° to the left, and the eye remained stable at this position for about 70 ms until the gaze saccade ended. Note, as also mentioned in relation to Figure 1B, that the final eye position at saccade end (15°) was within the 10°–20° range reported in the study of head-unrestrained gaze shifts in the monkey (Freedman and Sparks, 1997aFreedman E.G. Sparks D.L. Eye-head coordination during head-unrestrained gaze shifts in rhesus monkeys.J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 2328-2348PubMed Google Scholar). Cell M1-02 remained silent during this 70 ms period and was reactivated only at the end of the gaze saccade, not eye saccade. This result supports the hypothesis that the monkey SC controls head-free gaze saccades, not eye saccades (Freedman and Sparks, 1997aFreedman E.G. Sparks D.L.

Two of these residues, Tyr-40 and Tyr-60, can be partially replaced with hydroxyamino acids, but in the case of Tyr-40, replacement with either Ser or Thr generates a protein with modified substrate specificity. Replacement of Tyr-4 with either Trp or Phe generates a functional transporter.

In addition, aromatic residues can interact with cations through a strong, noncovalent force termed the cation/π interaction (for a review, see Ref. 22Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that aromatic residues in a protein can pull a cationic substrate (or a proton) out of water and into a nominally hydrophobic environment (22Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar). Recently it was demonstrated that the fully conserved Trp-63 is an essential residue, and substrate binding induces quenching of its fluorescence, suggesting that it may be interacting with substrate (23Elbaz Y. Tayer N. Steinfels E. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7369-7377Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this work, we further explore the role of aromatic residues in the activity of EmrE by studying the contribution of the tyrosine residues to its activity. EmrE has five tyrosine residues, at positions 4, 6, 40, 53, and 60. One of them, Tyr-60, is fully conserved in the small multidrug resistance family; Tyr-40 is conserved in a branch of this family (24Son M.S. Del Castilho C. Duncalf K.A. Carney D. Weiner J.H. Turner R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 914-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Position 4 is highly conserved as an aromatic amino acid. We have mutagenized each one of the tyrosine residues and examined the effect of the mutation on the protein function. Although replacement of the tyrosine residues in positions 6 and 53 had no effect on the protein function, the replacements of the residues in positions 4, 40, and 60 affected the activity of the protein. The results are discussed in the context of the published structures of EmrE. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli DH5α (Invitrogen) and TA15 (25Goldberg E.B. Arbel T. Chen J. Karpel R. Mackie G.A.

Mutants were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using the overlap extension procedure as described by Ho et al. (28Ho S.F. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) or using another procedure mainly as described by Li et al. (29Li F. Mullins J.I. Methods Mol.

Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16082-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)). Resistance to Toxic Compounds—E. coli DH5α cells transformed with either pT7-7-EmrE, pT7-7 (vector), or with the various mutants were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB-ampicillin medium. 5 μl of serial dilutions of the culture were spotted on a series of LB-ampicillin plates containing 30 mm BisTris propane) titrated to pH 7 with various EmrE substrates (100 μg/ml ethidium bromide, 50 μg/ml acriflavine, and 0.2 mm methyl viologen) or on a plate with no addition. Growth was analyzed after overnight incubation at 37 °C. Expression, Purification, and Reconstitution of EmrE into Proteoliposomes—E. coli TA15 cells bearing plasmids pGP1-2 and pT7-7 containing His-tagged EmrE constructs were grown at 30 °C in minimal medium A supplemented with 0.5% glycerol, 2.5 μg/ml thiamine, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. When the culture reached A600 = 1, it was transferred to 42 °C for 15 min to induce the T7 polymerase. Thereafter, the culture was shifted back to 30 °C. 2 h later, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended with buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 15 μg/ml DNase-I (Sigma), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and broken by a French press. The membrane fraction was collected by ultracentrifugation at 213,500 × g for 1 h at 4°Cand resuspended in the above buffer without dithiothreitol, DNase, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The membranes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C. Reconstitution was performed essentially as described previously (11Yerushalmi H. Mordoch S.S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12744-12748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 400 μl of membranes were solubilized in 2 ml of buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5 (Na-buffer), 1% DDM 3The abbreviations used are: DDM, n-dodecyl-β-maltoside; Ni-NTA, Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid; TPP+, tetraphenylphosphonium; MV2+, methyl viologen; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; TM, transmembrane segment. (Glycon GmbH), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After removal of unsolubilized material by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 30 min), imidazole was added to 20 mm, and the His-tagged protein was incubated with Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were washed with at least 4 ml of Na-buffer containing 1% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Glycon GmbH), 30 mm imidazole, and 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The protein was eluted with 500 μl of the same buffer containing 200 mm imidazole and mixed with 375 μlof E. coli phospholipid mix (10 mg of E. coli lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), 1.2% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl). Eluted protein and phospholipids were sonicated together in a bath-type sonicator to clarity and diluted in buffer containing 0.19 m NH4Cl, 15 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After 20 min at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 60 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C. Prior to the transport assay, the proteoliposomes were thawed at room temperature and sonicated lightly to clarity. To determine the protein concentration in the proteoliposomes, the proteoliposomes were solubilized in buffer containing 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 6 m urea, and 2% SDS (SDS-urea buffer) for 15 min. The solubilized proteins were immobilized to Ni-NTA beads for 1 h at room temperature. The unbound material was discarded, and the His-tagged protein bound to beads was washed twice with SDS-urea buffer. The protein was eluted from the beads using a buffer containing 200 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 450 mm imidazole and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. [3H]TPP+ Binding Assay—Tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) binding was assayed essentially as described previously (4Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Ni-NTA beads (10 μl/assay) were washed twice in distilled water and once in 0.08% DDM-Na buffer. Membranes, solubilized in 0.8% DDM-Na buffer, were added to the washed beads and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The unbound material was discarded, and the His-tagged protein bound to beads was washed twice with 0.08% DDM-Na buffer. Buffer containing 5 nm [3H]TPP+ (27 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the samples were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C. In each experiment, the values obtained in a control reaction with 25 μm unlabeled TPP+ were subtracted. Separating the beads from the supernatant by pulse centrifugation stopped the binding reaction. The bead fraction was then incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 450 μl of 0.08% DDM-Na buffer containing 150 mm imidazole to release the His-tagged protein and [3H] TPP+ bound to it from the beads. After spinning down the beads, the [3H]TPP+-associated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. All binding reactions were performed in duplicates. All of the experiments were repeated at least twice. [14C]Methyl Viologen Uptake Assay—Uptake of [14C]methyl viologen (MV2+) into proteoliposomes was assayed at 25 °C by dilution of 3 μlof the ammonium chloride-containing proteoliposomes into 200 μl of an ammonium-free solution (3Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 11Yerushalmi H. Mordoch S.S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol.

The latter contained 20 μm [14C]MV2+ (11.9 mCi/mmol, Sigma), 140 mm KCl, 10 mm Tricine, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8.6. At given times, the reaction was stopped by dilution with 2 ml of the same ice-cold solution filtering through Millipore GSWP filters (0.22 μm) and washing with an additional 2 ml of solution. The radioactivity on the filters was estimated by liquid scintillation. In each experiment, the values obtained in a control reaction with 15 μm nigericin were subtracted from all experimental points. Each experiment was performed at least twice. N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM)-fluorescein Labeling—Membranes from TA15 cells overexpressing the appropriate single Cys mutant were solubilized at 25 °C in either 0.8% DDM/Na-buffer or in Na-buffer supplemented with 0.5% SDS and 6 m urea. The extract was centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 revolutions/min to discard precipitates. NEM-fluorescein (Pierce) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm for 30 s (at 25 °C) for the DDM-solubilized protein and for 2 min (at 80 °C) for the protein solubilized in SDS. In some experiments, substrates were added at the indicated concentrations for 20 min at 25 °C before labeling with NEM-fluorescein. The reaction was stopped by dilution with the same buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol at a final concentration of 5 mm. To purify EmrE, the samples were added to Ni-NTA beads washed as described above and incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 1 h. Unbound material was discarded and EmrE bound to beads was washed twice with 0.5% SDS, 6 m urea, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The protein was eluted from the beads using a buffer containing 200 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 450 mm imidazole and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fluorescence labeling analysis of the gel was done using a Fujifilm LAS-1000 imaging system and digitally analyzed with Image Gauge version 3.46 Fujifilm software. The results were calibrated to the protein amount after staining of the same gels with Coomassie staining, scanning, and quantitation using the same software. Each experiment was performed at least three times. Tyrosine Replacements at Positions 6 and 53 Are Functional—In the amino acid sequence of EmrE, there are five tyrosine residues at positions 4, 6, 40, 53, and 60 (Fig. 1). According to the secondary structure model of EmrE (31Arkin I.T. Russ W.P. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7233-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Schwaiger M. Lebendiker M. Yerushalmi H. Coles M. Groger A. Schwarz C. Schuldiner S. Kessler H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), Tyr-4 and -6 are predicted to be located at the beginning of transmembrane segment (TM)1 facing the cytoplasm (33Ninio S. Elbaz Y. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); Tyr-53 is located in loop 2 connecting TM2 and TM3, whereas the other two tyrosine residues are located in the transmembrane regions Tyr-40 in TM 2 and Tyr-60 in TM 3. Tyr-60 is the only one fully conserved within the small multidrug resistance family (34Ninio S. Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48250-48256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In previous studies, the conservative replacement of Tyr-60 with Phe, an aromatic residue, resulted in a nonfunctional protein (35Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31044-31048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this study, we characterized the role of tyrosine residues in the function of EmrE with a set of mutants constructed using site-directed mutagenesis. The basic screen included assessment of the ability of the mutated proteins to confer resistance against toxicants. To evaluate expression levels and to study their function in more detail, all mutant proteins were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and assayed for their ability to bind TPP+, a high-affinity substrate of EmrE (4Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Upon induction of expression, all of the mutants tested, including those that failed to confer any resistance, expressed to similar levels (not shown). Previously, the Y40C mutant did not express to detectable levels. However, at the time, a different vector and a different purification protocol were used, and the three wild-type cysteine residues were replaced with Ser (27Steiner-Mordoch S. Granot D. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19480-19486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). When the mutant was expressed in pT7-7 with a Myc-His tag in the background, where the Cys residues were replaced with Ala (30Gutman N. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16082-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the expression level of Y40C was normal. All of the other mutants used in this work and in our recent papers are in the same background. The ability of the mutated proteins to confer resistance against toxicants was assessed by testing the ability of the cells expressing such mutated proteins to grow under otherwise nonpermissive conditions. This was achieved in solid media containing either ethidium bromide (100 μg/ml), acriflavine (50 μg/ml), or methyl viologen (0.2 mm) on which 5 μl of logarithmic dilutions of an overnight culture were spotted. Cells carrying the vector plasmid without any insert cannot grow on these media at any of the dilutions tested. Cells expressing either EmrE or CAMY were able to grow at each of the dilutions (Fig. 1). This assay provides a highly dynamic range to qualitatively analyze the activity of the mutants generated. Mutations at two positions were well tolerated. At position 6, two replacements that were designed based on evolutionary conservation observed at this position, Y6L and Y6F, displayed phenotypes almost undistinguishable from wild type (Fig. 1). Even a Cys replacement yielded a protein that conferred the same resistance. A Cys replacement at position 53 also yielded a protein with a robust phenotype (Fig. 1). All of the substitutions at these positions also bound [3H]TPP+ to considerable levels compared with that of EmrE control (Fig. 2). Because they are practically indistinguishable from wild type, these mutants were not studied further. An Aromatic Residue at Position 4 Is Required for Proper Coupling—At position 4, aromatic residues are evolutionarily conserved in >200 homologues (10Sharoni M. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32849-32855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Conservative replacements Y4F and Y4W displayed wild-type phenotype (Fig. 1) and robust binding activity (Fig. 2). Cysteine replacement at position 4 generated a protein that did not confer resistance to any of the toxicants tested (Fig. 1). Unexpectedly, the Y4C mutant displayed high levels of binding despite the fact that it did not confer resistance. To further investigate this apparent contradiction, the purified mutant protein was reconstituted into proteoliposomes, and ΔpH-driven uptake of MV2+ was measured quantitatively using a radiolabeled substrate (3Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In these experiments, a pH gradient (acid inside) was generated by diluting ammonium-loaded proteoliposomes into an ammonium-free medium. The wild-type protein accumulated radiolabeled MV2+ against its concentration gradient in a process that involves exchange of 2H+ with one substrate molecule (Fig. 3A). When proteoliposomes reconstituted with Y4C were used, no MV2+ accumulation was detected to any measurable degree (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the mutant did not transport TPP+ against its concentration gradient (data not shown), even though it bound it with high affinity (Fig. 2). Because Y4C binds substrate but does not transport it, we then asked whether it catalyzes downhill transport in the absence of a proton electrochemical gradient. To answer this question, proteoliposomes were loaded with radiolabeled MV2+ and diluted in the same medium (no H+ gradients generated) but without substrate. In such an experiment, the substrate rapidly effluxed from the proteoliposome in a transporter-mediated process (Fig. 3B). As shown in the figure, the rate of downhill transport catalyzed by Y4C was similar to that displayed by wild-type EmrE. These results suggest that an aromatic residue in this position is required for proper coupling between the substrate transport and the proton gradient. Mutants at Position 40 Display Modified Specificity—Several replacements at position 40 (Cys, Ser, Thr, Met, Phe, Leu, and Val) conferred resistance to MV2+ but not to acriflavine or ethidium (Fig. 1). None of the substitutions at position 40 bound TPP+ to significant levels (Fig. 2). Even though none of them bound any TPP+, the reconstituted proteins transported MV2+ against its concentration gradient, although at very different rates (Fig. 3C). Replacements with hydroxyamino acids, Y40T and Y40S, displayed significant MV2+ uptake activity at rates 40 and 22% of those of the wild type, respectively, whereas the activity of mutants Y40C and Y40F was lower (5% of wild type) but measurable. Therefore, the hydroxyamino acids can substitute for the tyrosine at this position much more efficiently, suggesting that the hydroxyl moiety is important for the transport activity. However, this is not an absolute requirement, because both Cys and Phe substitutions display low but measurable activity. The low activity of these mutants (and also replacements with Leu, Val, and Met) is sufficient to confer resistance in the phenotype assay described above. We have previously shown with other mutants that MV2+ uptake levels as low as 5% of the wild type can sustain growth under conditions that are nonpermissive to cells carrying the vector alone (27Steiner-Mordoch S. Granot D. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19480-19486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As we have demonstrated above, replacements with hydroxyamino acids at position 40 generate proteins that display significant MV2+ uptake activity even though they do not bind TPP+. Another way to explore the interaction of TPP+ with the protein is by testing its effect on MV2+ uptake. In such an experiment, proteoliposomes reconstituted with the corresponding protein were assayed for MV2+ uptake at various concentrations of TPP+. The results shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate that the IC50 value for TPP inhibition of the MV2+ uptake activity of Y40S was ∼55 times higher (∼4 μm) than the IC50 value for inhibition of the wild type. These results imply that the affinity to TPP+ is greatly decreased in the mutant and practically immeasurable with the direct binding assay. This observation suggests that the aromatic ring in position 40 has a significant role in TPP+ binding, whereas it is not essential for MV2+ recognition. To characterize the substrate specificity of this mutant, the ability of several drugs to inhibit MV2+ uptake of wild-type and Y40S EmrE was measured (Table 1). The results demonstrated that the MV2+ uptake activity of the mutant was affected differentially by different substrates. Although with most substrates, the differences in the IC50 values were moderate (from 2.6 to 7-fold), with the phosphonium derivatives, the increase in the IC50 values was dramatic; the IC50 values of diphenyldimethylphosphonium, triphenylmethylphosphonium, and TPP+ were 19, 37, and 55 times higher for Y40S compared with wild-type EmrE, respectively. The higher the number of aromatic rings on the tetrahedral phosphonium ion, the larger the detrimental effect of the Tyr mutation.TABLE 1Inhibition [14C]methyl viologen transport activity of EmrE and Y40S by a variety of drugs EmrE and the mutant protein Y40S were purified and reconstituted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Ammonium-loaded proteoliposomes (2 μl) were diluted into an ammonium-free medium containing [14C]methyl viologen and different concentrations of the indicated drugs, and radioactivity incorporated after 2 min was measured.

https://openalex.org/W2082133684,"Previous biochemical studies have demonstrated that Lys-123 ubiquitination of histone H2B is globally required for up-regulation of mono-, di, and trimethylation of Lys-4 of histone H3. However, recent studies have implicated H2B-Lys-123 ubiquitination in the regulation of di- and trimethylation, but not monomethylation, of H3-Lys-4 in vivo. Using a formaldehyde-based cross-linking and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we show that H3-Lys-4 trimethylation, but not dimethylation, is up-regulated by H2B-Lys-123 ubiquitination in vivo at the coding sequences of a set of transcriptionally active genes such as ADH1, PHO84, and PYK1. Both the ubiquitination of H2B-Lys-123 and the methylation of H3-Lys-4 are dispensable for recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the coding sequences of these genes, and hence, their transcription is not altered in the absence of these covalent modifications. However, recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the coding sequence of a galactose-inducible gene, GAL1, is significantly reduced in the absence of H2B-Lys-123 ubiquitination but not H3-Lys-4 methylation. Consistently, transcription of GAL1 is altered in the H2B-K123R point mutant strain. Finally, we show that H3-Lys-4 methylation does not regulate H3-Lys-9/14 acetylation. Collectively, our data reveal a “trans-tail” regulation of H3-Lys-4 tri- but not dimethylation by H2B-Lys-123 ubiquitination, and these modifications are dispensable for transcription of a certain set of genes in vivo.

The eukaryotic genome is packaged into chromatin that is an array of nucleosomes; in each nucleosomes, 146 bp of DNA is wrapped around an octamer of core histone proteins, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6884) Google Scholar). Chromatin is a dynamic structure that modulates the access of regulatory factors to the genetic material. Thus, transcription and other cellular processes that require access to DNA are regulated by chromatin structure, and therefore, a precise coordination and organization of events in opening and closing the chromatin is crucial for these cellular processes to happen normally. Post-translational modifications (e.g. acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and methylation) of the histones affect chromatin structure directly by altering DNA-histone interactions within and between nucleosomes, thus changing higher order chromatin structure (2Hayes J.J. Hansen J.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Histone modifications are, therefore, the key determinants in defining the active and repressed states of the chromatin (3van Holde K.E. Histone Modifications.

For example, methylation of H3-Lys-4 is correlated with gene activation, whereas H3-Lys-9 methylation results in repression and heterochromatin formation. Furthermore, histone acetylation is generally correlated with gene activation, although there are exceptions to this rule. Histone methylation on specific Lys or Arg residues is carried out by CARM1, PRMT1, and SET domain-containing enzymes (9Zhang Y. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2343-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar, 10Lachner M. Jenuwein T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The CARM1 and PRMT1 mediate Arg methylation, whereas Lys is methylated by the SET domain-containing enzymes (9Zhang Y. Reinberg D.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arg methylation of histones has not been demonstrated, but the N-terminal tail of histone H3 is methylated at Lys-4 and Lys-36. Lys methylation of histones in vivo occurs in three states: mono-, di, and trimethyl. Set1p, a component of the COMPASS complex, is involved in mono-, di-, and trimethylation of Lys-4 of H3 (11Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y. Winston F. Allis C.D.

We have extended these studies to several active genes in S. cerevisiae to determine whether such a regulatory link exists at their chromosomal loci, using a formaldehyde-based in vivo cross-linking and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 3The abbreviations used are: ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ChDIP, chromatin double immunoprecipitation; IP, immunoprecipitated; UAS, upstream activating sequence; WCE, whole cell extract; ORF, open reading frame; TBP, TATA box-binding protein; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; SAGA, Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase. 3The abbreviations used are: ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ChDIP, chromatin double immunoprecipitation; IP, immunoprecipitated; UAS, upstream activating sequence; WCE, whole cell extract; ORF, open reading frame; TBP, TATA box-binding protein; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; SAGA, Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase. assay. Our results reveal that H2B-Lys-123 ubiquitination regulates H3-Lys-4 trimethylation, but not dimethylation, at the coding sequences of the PHO84, ADH1, and PYK1 genes in vivo. Furthermore, we show that both H2B-Lys-123 ubiquitination and H3-Lys-4 methylation are dispensable for recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the coding sequences of these genes in vivo. Plasmids—The plasmid pRS416 (34Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used in the PCR-based gene disruption. Yeast Strains and Media—Yeast strain with null mutation in GCN5 (FY1370) and its isogenic wild-type equivalent, FY1369, were obtained from Fred Winston (Harvard Medical School). Yeast strain harboring point mutation in histone H2B at Lys-123 (YKH046) and its isogenic wild-type equivalent (YKH045) were obtained from Mary Ann Osley (University of New Mexico Health Science Center) (30Henry K.W. Wyce A. Lo W.S. Duggan L.J. Emre N.C. Kao C.F. Pillus L. Shilatifard A. Osley M.A. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2648-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The genotypes of these two strains are as follows: YKH045, MATa ura3-1 leu2-3,-112 his3-11,-15 trp1-1 ade2-1 htb1-1 htb2-1 pRS314 (FLAG-HTB1-CEN-TRP1) pRG145 (GAPDHprom-3HA-UBI4-URA3 Integrative; and YKH046, MATa ura3-1 leu2-3,-112 his3-11,-15 trp1-1 ade2-1 htb1-1 htb2-1 pRS314 (FLAG-htb1-CEN-TRP1) pRG145 (GAPDHprom-3HA-UBI4-UBA3 Integrative). FLAG tag was put on only copy of H2B, which is either wild-type or H2B-K123R point mutant. FLAG-tagged H2B or H2B-K123R was expressed from plasmid (pRS314) in both YKH045 and YKH046 strains. The triple HA-tagged ubiquitin was expressed from URA3 locus in both the wild-type and the mutant strains. The endogenous SET1 gene of W303a was disrupted using the PCR-based gene knock-out method (35Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2612) Google Scholar) to generate ASY16 (Δset1:URA3). For the studies at the GAL1 gene, the yeast strains were first grown in YPR (yeast extract containing peptone plus 2% raffinose) to an A600 of 0.9 and then transferred to YPG (yeast extract containing peptone plus 2% galactose) for 90 min at 30 °C prior to formaldehyde cross-linking. The yeast strains were grown in YPD (yeast extract containing peptone plus 2% dextrose) to an A600 of 1.0 at 30 °C for the studies at the PHO84, ADH1, and PYK1 genes. ChIP Assay—The ChIP assay was performed as described previously (36Li X.-Y. Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Science. 2000; 288: 1242-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 37Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde, collected, and resuspended in lysis buffer. Following sonication, cell lysates (800 μl of lysate from 100 ml of yeast culture) were precleared by centrifugation, and then 100 μl of lysate was used for each immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitated (IP) protein-DNA complexes were treated with protease K, the cross-links were reversed, and the DNA was purified. The IP DNA was dissolved in 20 μl of TE 8.0 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA), and 1 μl of IP DNA was analyzed by PCR. The PCR reactions (a total of 23 cycles) contained [α-32P]dATP (2.5 μCi for each 25-μl reaction), and the PCR products were detected by autoradiography after separation on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. As a control, “input” DNA was isolated from 5 μl of lysate without going through the immunoprecipitation step and suspended in 100 μl of TE 8.0. To compare the PCR signal arising from the IP DNA with that from the input DNA, 1 μl of input DNA was used for PCR analysis. Serial dilutions of input and IP DNA were used to assess the linear range of PCR amplification as described previously (38Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7365-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The PCR data presented in this report are within the linear range of PCR analysis. All the ChIP experiments were repeated at least three times, and consistent results were obtained. Primer pairs used for PCR analysis were as follows: PHO84(ORF1), 5′-TAGCTGATATTGTTGGTCGTAAGAG-3′ and 5′-TACCAATACCCATGACAAAACGGTA-3′; PHO84 (ORF2), 5′-TCTGCAGACATTTTGGTCAATGGAA-3′ and 5′-AAACGTTTTTGGAACCGGCATAAC-3′; ADH1(UAS), 5′-GTTTCCGGGTGTACAATATGG-3′ and 5′-CTATTGTATATCTCCCCTCCGC-3′; ADH1(Core), 5′-GGTATACGGCCTTCCTTCCAGTTAC-3′ and 5′-GAACGAGAACAATGACGAGGAAACAAAAG-3′; ADH1(ORF1), 5′-CTGGTTACACCCACGACGGTTCTT-3′ and 5′-CAGACTTCAAAGCCTTGTAGACG-3′; ADH1(ORF2), 5′-CGGTAACAGAGCTGACACCAGAGA-3′ and 5′-ACGTATCTACCAACGATTTGACCC-3′; PYK1(ORF1), 5′-CAGAAAGTCCGAAGAATTGTACCCA-3′ and 5′-TACTTGTCATCGGTGGTGAAGATCA-3′; PYK1(ORF2), 5′-AAGTTTCCGATGTCGGTAACGCTAT-3′ and 5′-TTGGCAAGTAAGCGATAGCTTGTTC-3′; GAL1 (UAS), 5′-CGCTTAACTGCTCATTGCTATATTG-3′ and 5′-TTGTTCGGAGCAGTGCGGCGC-3′; GAL1 (Core), 5′-ATAGGATGATAATGCGATTAGTTTTTTAGCCTT-3′ and 5′-GAAAATGTTGAAAGTATTAGTTAAAGTGGTTATGCA-3′; GAL1(ORF), 5′-CAGAGGGCTAAGCATGTGTATTCT-3′ and 5′-GTCAATCTCTGGACAAGAACATTC-3′. Autoradiograms were scanned and quantitated by the NIH Image 1.62 program. IP DNAs were quantitated and presented as the ratio of IP to input (%IP). For mutant strains, DNA immunoprecipitated relative to wild-type (WT) was presented as %WT. Chromatin Double Immunoprecipitation (ChDIP) Assay—To determine the levels of H2B-Lys-123 ubiquitination at the active gene loci, we performed a ChDIP assay as described previously (30Henry K.W. Wyce A. Lo W.S. Duggan L.J. Emre N.C. Kao C.F. Pillus L. Shilatifard A. Osley M.A. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2648-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 33Shukla A. Stanojevic N.

Briefly, 400 μl of lysate from 50 ml of yeast culture was first immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) and protein A/G plus agarose beads. Following elution of anti-FLAG IP with FLAG peptide (Sigma), the eluate was immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA antibody, and the IP DNA sample was dissolved in 10 μl of TE 8.0, of which 1 μl was used for PCR analysis. The input DNA was isolated from 5 μl of lysate and suspended in 100 μl of TE 8.0, of which 1 μl was used for PCR analysis. Primer Extension Analysis—Primer extension analysis was performed as described previously (33Shukla A. Stanojevic N. Duan Z. Sen P. Bhaumik S.R. Mol. Cell.

Briefly, total RNA was prepared from 10 ml of yeast culture grown up to an A600 of 1.0. Fifteen micrograms of total RNA was used in the primer extension analysis using 32P-labeled primer and AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega). The primers used for analysis of PHO84, ADH1, PYK1, and GAL1 mRNAs were as follows: PHO84, 5′-GAAGACTTCTTTCAGCAACATG-3′; ADH1, 5′-TATCCTTGTGTTCCAATTTACCGTGG-3′; PYK1, 5′-CAATGATGGAGGTTCTTCTCAAGTC-3′; GAL1, 5′-CCTTGACGTTAAAGTATAGAGG-3′. All of these primers were located at around 100 nucleotides downstream of the transcriptional start site. Whole Cell Extract (WCE) Preparation and Western Blot Analysis—For global biochemical analysis of H3-Lys-9/14 acetylation in the SET1 deletion mutant and its isogenic wild-type equivalent, the yeast strains were grown in 100 ml of YPD up to an A600 of 1.0, and then harvested cells were lysed and sonicated to prepare the WCE with solubilized chromatin following the protocol as described previously for the ChIP assay (36Li X.-Y.

Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The WCE was run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then analyzed by Western blot. The anti-Lys-9/14 di-acetylated H3 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and anti-H3 (Abcam, Inc.) antibodies were used for Western blot analysis. H2B-Lys-123 Ubiquitination Upregulates H3-Lys-4 Tribut Not Dimethylation at the Coding Sequences of PHO84, ADH1, and PYK1—Previous ChIP studies have demonstrated ubiquitination at Lys-123 of H2B at the transcriptionally active genes (30Henry K.W.

However, it is not known whether such a regulatory link between H2B-Lys-123 ubiquitination and H3-Lys-4 diand trimethylation is generally present at all active gene loci in vivo. To address this question, we analyzed the levels of H3-Lys-4 diand trimethylation at a subset of the active genes such as PHO84, ADH1, and PYK1 in the H2B-K123R mutant (where H2B ubiquitination does not occur) and its isogenic wild-type strains, using a ChIP assay in S. cerevisiae.

Two sets of ORF-specific primer pairs were used that, as shown in Fig. 1A, could distinguish binding to the 5′-end (ORF1) and 3′-end (ORF2) of the coding sequence. The average size of the PCR products at the ORF1 and ORF2 of the above genes was confirmed to be around 150 bp by agarose gel electrophoresis. Fig. 1B shows the size of the PCR product using a specific primer pair targeted to the PYK1 ORF1. The other PCR products also appeared at the same position in the agarose gel (data not shown). To determine the effect of H2B-Lys-123 ubiquitination on H3-Lys-4 methylation at the active gene loci, we first analyzed the levels of H3-Lys-4 diand trimethylation at the coding sequences of PHO84, ADH1, and PYK1, using a ChIP assay. Fig. 1C shows that the coding sequences of these genes were both diand trimethylated in the H2B wild-type strain. The ratio of immunoprecipitate over the input is indicated below each band as %IP. The antibodies used in the ChIP assay were specific to diand trimethyl Lys-4 of H3 since these antibodies did not generate the ChIP signals at the coding sequences that were devoid of H3-Lys-4 diand trimethylation in the SET1 deletion mutant strain (see Fig. 4A). Next, we determined whether the coding sequences of the PHO84, ADH1, and PYK1 genes were also ubiquitinated at Lys123 of H2B, using a ChDIP (see “Experimental Procedures”) assay (30Henry K.W. Wyce A.

In the ChDIP assay, the first immunoprecipitation was performed using an anti-FLAG antibody, and the eluate was subsequently immunoprecipitated by an anti-HA antibody. The IP DNA was analyzed by PCR using primer pairs specific for ORF1 and ORF2 regions of the PHO84 coding sequence (Fig. 1A). If FLAG-tagged H2B is ubiquitinated at Lys-123, a PCR signal would be observed in the wild-type but not the H2B-K123R mutant strain. Fig. 1D indeed shows the presence of the PCR signals at the ORF1 and ORF2 of PHO84 in the H2B wild-type but not H2B-K123R mutant strain, thus demonstrating the specific association of Lys-123-ubiquitinated H2B with the PHO84 coding sequence.

SALL1 plays a critical role during kidney development as mutations of the human SALL1 gene cause Townes-Brocks syndrome, which is associated with kidney malformation.

In transient transfection assays, SALL1 promoter activity was higher in HEK-293 human kidney cells and COS-7 monkey kidney cells than in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, consistent with its role in kidney development. Transcription from the SALL1 promoter was strikingly activated by the SIX1 protein. Utilizing a luciferase reporter gene assay, endogenous or exogenously added SIX1 activated the SALL1 promoter. Overexpression of SIX1 induced a significant increase in the endogenous SIX1 protein. In addition, co-expression of SIX1 and Eya1 resulted in a significant increase in the SALL1 promoter activity when compared with either SIX1 or Eya1 alone. Finally, we demonstrate that SIX1 was able to bind to the SALL1 promoter by retardation assays and that deletion of the putative element of SIX1 significantly diminishes the SALL1 promoter activity response to SIX1 stimulation.

Townes-Brocks syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) 107480) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized predominantly by renal, urogenital, anal, limb, and ear anomalies (1Townes P.

Kidney malformations occur in ∼60% of Townes-Brocks syndrome patients, including unilateral or bilateral hypoplastic or dysplastic kidneys, renal agenesis, and multicystic kidneys. The human homologue of the Drosophila SAL gene, SALL1, maps to chromosome 16q12.1, and alterations of this locus were found in Townes-Brocks syndrome families (3Kohlhase J. Schuh R. Dowe G.

In Drosophila melanogaster, Sal is a region-specific homeotic gene that acts as an important downstream target of the HH (hedgehog) and the DPP (decapentaplegic) signaling pathways (8de Celis J.F.

Drosophila Sal is required for specification of the posterior head and anterior tail segments, as well as for the larval tracheal system (14Kuhnlein R.P. Schuh R.

Each homologue is expressed during embryonic development, as well as in specific adult tissues. Drosophila SAL mutation leads to the incomplete transformation of head and tail segments into trunk-like characters and the establishment of larval legs and discs (19Jurgens G.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 168-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Renal ontogeny begins with the interaction of the ureteric bud and the metanephric mesenchyme (21Lechner M. Dressler G. Mech. Dev. 1997; 62: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 22Dressler G. Dev. Genet. 1999; 24: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The ureteric bud induces the metanephric blastema to condense and aggregate, with subsequent formation of the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney. Conversion of metanephric mesenchyme into differentiated renal epithelium is a process that must be accompanied by activation or induction of specific factors that coordinate morphological changes in the developing kidney (22Dressler G. Dev. Genet. 1999; 24: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 23Dressler G.R. Semin. Nephrol. 1995; 15: 263-271PubMed Google Scholar). The human SIX1, a member of the SIX classes of homeodomain genes, is one such transcription factor functioning as a master regulatory protein and activating multiple sets of genes during kidney development. During normal mouse kidney development, Six1 is expressed in uninduced metanephric mesenchyme and in the induced mesenchyme around the ureteric bud. In Six1 null mutants, the ureter fails to invade the mesenchyme, which consequently undergoes apoptosis. Six1 is considered to be required for the earliest phase of kidney development. Therefore, downstream direct targets of Six1 need to be identified for better understanding of kidney development. We previously showed that the SALL1 gene was expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme within and around the ureteric bud and in early or differentiated epithelial structures (24Ma Y. Singer D.B. Gozman A. Ford D. Chai L. Steinhoff M.M. Hansen K. Maizel A.L. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2001; 16: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). SALL1 is not expressed in glomeruli (24Ma Y. Singer D.B. Gozman A. Ford D. Chai L. Steinhoff M.M. Hansen K. Maizel A.L. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2001; 16: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Similar to Six1, Nishinakamura et al. (7Nishinakamura R. Matsumoto Y. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Sato A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Scully S. Lacey D.L. Katsuki M. Asashima M. Yokota T. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that homozygous deletion of the Sall1 gene resulted in failure of ureteric bud outgrowth and apoptosis of the mesenchyme. All together, properly timed activation and suppression of SALL1 are essential for normal kidney development, and SALL1 is tightly controlled during kidney development. Little is known, however, about the mechanism of SALL1 gene regulation. We have investigated transcriptional regulation of the SALL1 promoter. Our data suggest that SALL1 is a target of SIX1 transcription during the course of normal kidney development. Cell Culture—HEK-293 human kidney cells, COS-7 monkey kidney cells, NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, and PC3 prostate cancer cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified environment with 5% carbon dioxide and 10% fetal serum. Plasmid Constructs—SIX1FL, full-length human SIX1 cDNA, ΔNterm, deletion construct lacking the SIX1 N terminus (from the start codon to nucleotide 689, which is in the first helix of the encoded domain), ΔCterm, deletion construct lacking the SIX1 C terminus (beginning from nucleotide 822, just after the homeodomain, and terminating at the STOP codon), and ΔHD, deletion construct lacking the N-terminal and C-terminal portion of the SIX1 (see Fig. 5A), were kindly provided by Dr. Heide L. Ford (25Ford H.L. Landesman-Bollag E. Dacwag C.S. Stukenberg P.T. Pardee A.B. Seldin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22245-22254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).

Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends—The 5′-end of the SALL1 cDNA was determined with the 5′-RACE 4The abbreviations used are: RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; siRNA, small interfering RNA; WT, wild type; Luc, luciferase. -PCR method. Human kidney Marathon-Ready cDNA (Clontech) was amplified with the PCR primer adaptor AP1 and the cDNA-specific primer R1 of SALL1 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolation of BAC Clones for SALL1—A two-step PCR was used to screen a human BAC library for a BAC clone containing the SALL1 gene. Positive BAC clones were purified and verified by direct nucleotide sequencing. Chromosomal Localization—Chromosomal localization was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization. DNA isolated from a SALL1 BAC clone was labeled with digoxigenin and hybridized to human peripheral blood lymphocytes in metaphase. Signals were detected via fluorescence-conjugated avidin. Chromosomes were counterstained with 4′, 6-diamidino2-phenylindole dihydrochloride. SALL1 Promoter Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The 5′-flanking region of SALL1 was amplified with primers (5′-primer, 5′-GGCCATGGCTCGAGTCTACCGGAGCG-C-AGTACAGGTCCGGA-3′, and 3′-primer, 5′-CGCCATGGAAGCTTGGCTCAAACATCAGCTGGGGCAGAAT-3′) to generate a fragment from 1 to 2002 bp upstream of the first ATG, with HindIII and XhoI sites at each end, respectively. The SALL1 BAC DNA, instead of human genomic DNA, was used as a template to avoid amplification of a SALL1 pseudogene. After HindIII and XhoI digestion, this fragment was cloned into the promoterless pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega) at the HindIII and XhoI sites to generate –2002-Luc. The fragments of –1500-Luc, –1000-Luc, –500-Luc, and –21-Luc were created in the same manner as –2002-Luc. A deletion mutant of a –2002-Luc SALL1 promoter construct that lacks the consensus site for SIX1 was generated using a QuikChange II mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Transfection—Transfection was performed with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of ∼1 × 105 cells/well. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. Plasmid DNA for transient transfection was prepared with the Qiagen plasmid mini kit (Qiagen). To analyze the SALL1 promoter constructs, 0.8 μg of the SALL1 promoter reporter plasmid and 0.2 μg of the internal control β-galactosidase plasmid, CMV-β-galactosidase (Invitrogen), were used. For co-transfection experiments with SIX1, a total of 1.2 μg of plasmid DNA was used. The reaction contained 0.5 μg of the SALL1 promoter reporter plasmid and either 0.5 μg of empty vector DNA or 0.5 μg of the SIX1 expression plasmid plus 0.2 μg of internal control CMV-β-galactosidase plasmid. β-Galactosidase and Luciferase Assays—Cells were extracted with the use of 100 μl of luciferase cell culture lysis reagent (Promega) 24 h after transfection. The β-galactosidase assay, performed with 10 μl of cell extract, used the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega) and the standard assay protocol provided by the manufacturer (except that 1 m Tris base was used as stopping buffer instead of sodium carbonate). For the luciferase assay, 5 μl of extract was used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. After subtraction of the background, luciferase activity (arbitrary units) was normalized to β-galactosidase activity (arbitrary units) for each sample. SiRNA—HEK-293 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cell/ml into 24-well dishes and transfected with EYA1 small interference RNA (siRNA) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using Lipofectin 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Renilla plasmid (Promega) was used as an internal control. EYA1 siRNA was a pool of three separate strands targeting different EYA1 mRNA locations. The strand information is as follows: Strand A, 5′-CCAAUGAGCAGCAGUGAAA-3′; Strand B, 5′-GCAACAAGCUACAGC CUAU-3′; Strand C, 5′-GCAAACGCUUCAGUUGUUA-3′. An siRNA that consists of a scrambled sequence was also used as a control. Western Immunoblotting—Cell lines were harvested with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA and lysed in a buffer composed of 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm pyrophosphate, 1 mm vanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Protein content of the lysates was determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE followed by electrophoretic transfer of the proteins to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in T-TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 135 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated either with an anti-SIX1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or with an anti-human β-actin antibody (0.1 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Membranes were then washed extensively with T-TBS and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Bands corresponding to SIX1, SALL1, and β-actin proteins were detected using the SuperSignal West Pico® chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Antibody Generation—The N-terminal peptide (DGDDTEKGQPSRPTKSDK) and the C-terminal peptide (EKMASSENGTNRFTR) of SALL1 were chosen for their potential antigenicity and used for immunization of chickens in collaboration with Lampire Biological Laboratories (Pipersville, PA). SALL1 antibodies IgY were purified from chicken eggs. Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assays—Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing 5′-protruding ends were labeled by [α-32P]dCTP with Klenow fragment and used for gel mobility shift assays as probes. Nuclear extracts were prepared from the HEK-293 cells as described previously (28Fraizer G.C. Shimamura R. Zhang X. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30678-30687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An antiserum to SIX1 was mixed with the nuclear extracts before the addition of the labeled probes. The gel mobility shift assay was performed using the method described previously in Ref. 28Fraizer G.C. Shimamura R. Zhang X. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30678-30687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar. Wild type probe, WT (5′-primer, 5′-TGAACCCATCAGGTTCCCAAACGT-3′, 3′-primer, 5′-ACGTTTGGGAACCTGATGGGTTCA-3′), mutant type probe, MT (5′-primer: 5′-TGATCGGACTAGTTGCCCAAACGT-3′, and 3′-primer, 5′-ACGTTTGGGCAACTAGTCCGATCA-3′) were used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Cloning and Sequencing of the Human SALL1 5′-flanking Region—To identify the promoter region(s) upstream of SALL1, we screened a human BAC genomic library. One BAC clone was isolated, and direct nucleotide sequencing and restriction mapping showed that it contained the full-length SALL1 gene. An intronless pseudogene, SALL1P, has been reported and bears identical sequences, except for several mutations in the coding region. This pseudogene has been mapped to chromosome Xp11.2 (29Kohlhase J. Kohler A. Jackle H. Engel W. Stick R. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1999; 84: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To determine whether the isolated BAC clone was specific for SALL1 gene, DNA from the SALL1 BAC clone was labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP by nick translation and hybridized in situ to normal human chromosomes derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that the BAC clone containing SALL1 localized to the proximal long arm of chromosome 16 (q12.1) (Fig. 1, A and B), consistent with a previous report of the SALL1 locus (3Kohlhase J. Schuh R. Dowe G. Kuhnlein R. Jackle H. Schroeder B. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Kretzchmar H. Kohler A. Muller U. Raab-Vetter M. Burkhardt E. Engel W. Stick R. Genomics. 1996; 38: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This study demonstrated that the isolated BAC clone indeed contained the SALL1 gene but not the SALL1P gene. Cloning of the 5′-End of SALL1 cDNA—The 5′-end of SALL1 cDNA was determined by 5′-RACE-PCR using human fetal kidney Marathon-Ready cDNA pool as templates. The PCR product obtained by this method, using primers AP1 and R1, appeared as a major band on agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1, C and D). The sequence of this major PCR product subcloned into the pBluescript (Stratagene) vector revealed the major 5′-end as –69 (the translation start site was set at +1). Analysis of SALL1 Promoter Sequence—Sequencing of the 5′-flanking region of SALL1 did not reveal a classic TATA or CAAT box. This region, however, was GC-rich and contained several GC boxes. A search of Genomatrix, the Transcription Factor Database, revealed several putative binding sites for regulatory transcription factors scattered within 2.0 kb upstream of the ATG translation site, including 11 sites for WT1 and one site for SIX1(Fig. 2A). To determine whether this region shared strong sequence conservation with the murine SALL1 promoter, the human and murine SALL1 promoter sequences were aligned for sequence comparison. The entire human SALL1 promoter, consisting of ∼2000 bp, showed ∼89% homology with the murine promoter. An example of a region with a high degree of sequence similarity between the murine and human sequences is shown in Fig. 2B. Characterization of the Transcriptional Activity of the Human SALL1 Promoter—The functional roles of SALL1 in the kidney development combining with the potential SIX1 binding site within the SALL1 promoter suggested that SIX1 might modulate the SALL1 expression. To examine the correlation between the SALL1 promoter activity and SIX1 expression, we first analyzed the SALL1 promoter activity. An ∼2.0-kb sequence upstream of the ATG translation site was subcloned into the 5′-end or upstream of the promoterless pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter plasmid. Luciferase expression in transient transfection assays was next evaluated in the presence of a constant amount of internal plasmid expressing β-galactosidase. In the HEK-293, COS-7, PC3, and NIH-3T3 cells, luciferase activity was, respectively, 9.2-, 6-, 3.7-, and 2-fold higher than it was with the promoterless vector (Fig. 3A). The SALL1 promoter activity was weak in the PC3 and NIH-3T3 cells, which expressed very little or no SIX1, respectively (Fig. 3B). In contrast, HEK-293 and COS-7 cells showed the highest level of reporter gene expression, which correlated with high expression of SIX1 in these two cell lines (Fig. 3B). To define the minimal DNA sequence required for the SALL1 promoter activity and to analyze DNA sequences potentially important for regulation of SALL1 transcription, transient transfections were performed with a series of deleted DNA fragments surrounding the transcription start sites in a luciferase reporter gene assay. Each resulting recombinant plasmid DNA construct was then transiently transfected into HEK-293 cells. The series of deleted promoter fragments used in the transfection containing –2002, –1502, –1002, –502, and –21 bp upstream sequences are shown in Fig. 3C. All five constructs exhibited functional promoter activity in HEK-293 cells. Among the five constructs, the –1002 bp upstream sequence showed the highest relative luciferase activity (Fig. 3C). Luciferase activity decreased progressively to ∼35% of that of –1002 as the sequence length increased, which suggested the presence of upstream suppressor activity between –2002 and –1002. Removal of the upstream region (–1002/–21) led to basic levels of luciferase activity similar to those of pGL3-Basic, indicating the presence of strong promoter activity in this region. Transcriptional Activation of Human SALL1 Promoter by SIX1—Sequence analysis of the SALL1 promoter revealed a potential SIX binding site. Given the known importance of the SIX and Eya networks in the earliest kidney development, we assessed whether these transcription factors could alter transcription from the SALL1 promoter. HEK-293 cells were transfected with each of the SIX and Eya members. The SALL1 promoter was activated by different SIX members that we examined, except for SIX5 (Fig. 4), although the degree of SALL1 promoter activation varies among the SIX1 members. However, little or no increase in a luciferase activity in HEK-293 cells was observed by co-transfection of each of the Eya members with the SALL1 promoter construct. This could be due to the fact that Eya alone bears no apparent DNA binding activity. It serves as a co-activator for SIX1 in gene transcription regulation function (30Ikeda K. Watanabe Y. Ohto H. Kawakami K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6759-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of endogenous SIX1 in HEK-293 cells, its expression level is still significantly low when compared with that of SIX1 co-transfected with Eya; thus only low SALL1 promoter activities were observed. Since SIX1 is the best characterized gene for studying kidney development and the mutant phenotype of Six1 in mice clearly resembles that of Sall1–/– in renal development (7Nishinakamura R. Matsumoto Y. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Sato A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Scully S. Lacey D.L. Katsuki M. Asashima M. Yokota T.

Biol. 2002; 22: 6759-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we next looked at the effects of the cellular context of endogenous SIX1 on SALL1 promoter in different cell lines. We analyzed the effects of SIX1 on SALL1 promoter activity with transient transfection assays. Human SALL1 promoter reporter gene expressions were examined in the HEK-293, COS-7, PC3, and NIH-3T3 cells. SIX1 was able to activate the SALL1 promoter by 3-fold in HEK-293 cells, 7-fold in COS-7 cells, 28-fold in PC3 cells, and 20-fold in the NIH-3T3 cells when compared with the pCDNA3 control (Fig. 5A). PC3 and NIH-3T3 expressed weak or no endogenous SALL1 protein (Fig. 3B), and high levels of exogenous SIX1 greatly increased SALL1 promoter activity in these cell lines. To determine dose-dependent activation of the SALL1 promoter, the SIX1 responsiveness of the SALL1 promoter was evaluated by co-transfection of 1 μg of the SALL1 promoter construct and 0.2 μg of β-galactosidase plasmid, together with increasing amounts of the SIX1 expression construct (0–3 μg) (Fig. 5B). SALL1 promoter activity was increased more than 4-fold by co-transfection with an ∼1-fold excess of the SIX1 construct. When this experiment was repeated with the use of a 3:1 molar excess of the SIX1 construct, the promoter was further greatly activated, showing a greater than 11-fold increase (Fig. 5B). To determine the essential region of SIX1 that exerts these activation effects, different deletion constructs were used to test the activation function. SIX1 lacking the C terminus (ΔC) increased the luciferase activity at a similar level when compared with the full-length protein (SIX1FL, data not shown). In contrast, those lacking the homeodomain (ΔHD) or the N terminus (ΔN) failed to exhibit these activation effects (Fig. 5C), suggesting that these regions are necessary for inducing SALL1 expression. Activation of the Endogenous SALL1 Protein by SIX 1—To study the SALL1 protein expression, we generated the N-terminal and C-terminal SALL1 antibodies in chickens. To characterize these antibodies, we transfected the HEK-293 cells with empty plasmid or plasmid encoding polyhistidine (His6)-tagged SALL1. Lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the N-terminal and C-terminal SALL1 peptide antibodies or an anti-polyhistidine antibody. Both the N-terminal and the C-terminal antibodies specifically recognized a ∼200-kDa protein of endogenous or overexpressed SALL1 (Fig. 6A). The ∼200-kDa protein derived from overexpressed SALL1 was also detected by an anti-polyhistidine antibody (Fig. 6A). These studies demonstrated the specificity of our antibodies. To determine whether the enhanced expression of SIX1 alters endogenous levels of SALL1 protein, the HEK-293 cells were transfected with increasing amount of SIX1 expression construct. As can be seen in Fig. 6B, the endogenous SALL1 protein was greatly enhanced by overexpression of SALL1. Moreover, the increased expression of the endogenous SALL1 protein induced by the SIX1 was exhibited in a dose-dependent fashion. To examine whether SIX1 is able to bind directly to the SALL1 promoter, we examined the potential binding site of SIX1 within the SALL1 promoter using gel retardation assays. A synthetic double-strand DNA probe containing a sequence of the SALL1 promoter (–954/–935) was synthesized and designated as SIX1 WT. The potential binding site for SIX1 was in the middle of the 21-bp oligonucleotides. Nuclear extracts of the HEK-293 cells containing SIX1 transcriptional factor were bound to the radiolabeled SIX1 WT probe (Fig. 6C). The DNA-SIX1 complex is indicated with an arrow. In an attempt to verify this complex containing SIX1 protein, nuclear extract of HEK-293 was incubated with the SIX1 WT probe in the presence or absence of an antibody against the SIX1 protein. Fig. 6C showed that the DNA-SIX1 complex interacted with an anti-SIX1 antibody but not with a control antibody (normal rabbit IgG) demonstrated by supershift assays. In addition, the DNA-SIX1 protein complex was not observed when using the mutant SIX1 probe, SIX1 mutant. To test the effect of the mutation of the identified SIX1 binding site on the SALL1 promoter activity, the consensus SIX1 binding site (–948 to –942) was deleted and introduced into the SALL1 promoter (SALL1m). The luciferase activities of the resulting construct (SALL1m) were then compared with the activity of the wild type or co-transfection with SIX1 in HEK-293 cells. There is no difference in luciferase activities between the SALL1 promoter mutant (SALL1m) and the wild type promoter construct in HEK-293 cells. However, deletion of 7 bp (–948 to –942) of the putative binding site of SIX1 resulted in 3-fold reduction in the luciferase activity (Fig. 6D) when compared with that of the wild type. This study indicates that the SIX1 consensus binding site is a functional site present on the SALL1 promoter. Cooperation of SIX1 and Eya1 in Activation of SALL1 Promoter—The SIX and Eya families are co-expressed in multiple organs. Eya, which has no apparent DNA binding activity, serves as co-activator (30Ikeda K. Watanabe Y. Ohto H. Kawakami K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6759-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that SIX1 and Eya1 are able to synergistically activate reporter gene transcription. We next investigated the SALL1 reporter gene activity by further transient co-transfection assays. Transfection of SIX1 resulted in an ∼1.5-fold increase in luciferase activity, and the activation level was increased to ∼2.5-fold by the co-transfection of Eya1. However, Eya1 alone had a minimal effect on the luciferase activity (Fig. 7A). To further examine the role of Eya1 in the SIX1/Eya1/SALL1 network, we disrupted Eya1 expression in the HEK-293 cells by an siRNA approach. Three different siRNA sequences targeting Eya1 and a scrambled control siRNA comprised of a non-targeting sequence without significant similarity to any known human gene sequences were used. Eya1 mRNA was highly expressed in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 7B). Completely knocking down Eya1 expression significantly diminished the SALL1 promoter activity response to SIX1 stimulation (Fig. 7B) Kidney development requires SALL1 expression, and the expression of SALL1 in the kidney is associated with proliferating cells of the ureteric bud and the differentiating nephrogenic mesenchyme. How SALL1 expression is induced in this tissue is unknown. What we detail here is the first characterization of the human SALL1 gene promoter and its activation by SIX1. The SALL1 promoter has no TATA or CCAAT boxes in the vicinity of the transcription start sites, and this is similar to the situation with SALL2, another member of SALL gene family. The TATA-less promoters, which are usually associated with multiple transcription start sites, are observed primarily in housekeeping genes and many genes in the hematopoietic system. Deletion analysis of the promoter region revealed a negative element, which may reside between –2000 and –500 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon. Significant homology exists between murine and human SALL1 promoter sequences of the 5′-flanking region, suggesting a conserved function of regulation of SALL1 gene expression. Putative binding sites were identified in the promoter region. The most interesting finding was the presence of consensus sites for WT1 and SIX. The WT1 and SIX binding sites were highly conserved between human and mouse sequences. The functional importance of WT1 and SIX with respect to modulation of the SALL1 expression needs to be examined. Previously, we have shown that the WT1 was able to suppress expression of SALL2, the other member of SALL family (31Ma Y. Li D. Chai L. Luciani A.M. Ford D. Morgan J. Maizel A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48223-48230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple potential binding sites in the SALL1 promoter region indicates that WT1 may be a transcriptional regulator for SALL1 as well. Using a reporter gene assay, transcription from the SALL1 promoter was strikingly suppressed by the WT1 tumor suppressor protein in a dose dependent manner (data not shown). We discovered a positive regulatory element between –948 and –942 of SALL1, which contained a consensus binding site for SIX1. To determine whether SIX1 modulates SALL1 expression in kidney, we examined the promoter regulatory regions, utilizing a functional luciferase assay with co-transfection of the SIX1 plasmid in HEK-293 cells. The SALL1 promoter was found to be significantly activated by the SIX1. In addition, we observed dose-dependent and cell type-specific activation of the SALL1 promoter by co-transfection of SIX1 in several different cell lines. The exogenous SIX1 could up-regulate the transcription of the SALL1 report gene construct in vitro. These studies are consistent with previous findings in animals that deletion of SIX1 in mice results in the loss of SALL1 expression (32Xu P.X. Zheng W. Huang L. Maire P. Laclef C. Silvius D. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 3085-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Mutations of transcription factors SIX1 and SALL1 result in incomplete ureteric bud outgrowth and mesenchymal apoptosis, leading to a failure of tubule formation (7Nishinakamura R. Matsumoto Y. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Sato A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Scully S. Lacey D.L. Katsuki M. Asashima M. Yokota T.

Cell. 1993; 74: 679-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). Kidney phenotypes of SALL1 in deficient mice, similar to those of SIX1, raise the possibility that both SIX1 and SALL1 act in the same pathway(s) in kidney development. To further explore this model, we extend our study to a co-activator of SIX1, Eya1. Mutation in human Eya1 is associated with branchio-oto-renal syndrome with abnormalities including renal and otic organs similar to a human disease caused by a SALL1 mutation. These findings suggest that there is a complex gene network involving SIX1/EY1/SALL1. Eya1 bears no apparent DNA binding activity and can be translocated to the nucleus by the SIX1 protein (30Ikeda K. Watanabe Y. Ohto H. Kawakami K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6759-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that SIX1 and Eya1 are able to synergistically activate the target genes. We examined the effect of the Eya1 on the transcriptional induction of SALL1 in a reporter gene assay. Co-expression of SIX1 and Eya1 resulted in a significant increase in the SALL1 promoter activity when compared with either SIX1 or Eya1 alone. Endogenous Eya1 mRNA knockouts by siRNA sequences targeting Eya1 significantly diminish SALL1 promoter activity. This further indicates that Eya1 can serve as a co-activator of SIX1 in the regulation of the SALL1 expression. A proposal of the SIX1-Eya1 genetic network in the regulation of the SALL1 expression is shown in Fig. 7, C and D. In conclusion, our studies provide a starting point for a more detailed examination of human SALL gene regulation. Our studies strongly suggest that SIX1 likely plays a role in the induction of SALL1 expression during normal kidney development. Further studies are needed to elucidate the biological function of the SIX1-mediated transcript of SALL1 in kidney development. We gratefully acknowledge Dr. Heide L. Ford for making available SIX1 and Eya plasmid constructs."

To better understand the mechanism of β-arrestin-mediated ERK1/2 activation, we compared ERK1/2 activation by the wild-type neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor with a chimeric NK1 receptor having β-arrestin1 fused to the receptor C terminus (NK1-βArr1). The NK1 receptor couples to both Gs and Gq/11, resides on the plasma membrane, and mediates rapid ERK1/2 activation and nuclear translocation in response to neurokinin A. In contrast, NK1-βArr1 is a G protein-uncoupled “constitutively desensitized” receptor that resides almost entirely in an intracellular endosomal compartment. Despite its inability to respond to neurokinin A, we found that NK1-βArr1 expression caused robust constitutive activation of cytosolic ERK1/2 and that endogenous Raf, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 coprecipitated in a complex with NK1-βArr1. While agonist-dependent ERK1/2 activation by the NK1 receptor was independent of protein kinase A (PKA) or PKC activity, NK1-βArr1-mediated ERK1/2 activation was completely inhibited when basal PKA and PKC activity were blocked. In addition, the rate of ERK1/2 dephosphorylation was slowed in NK1-βArr1-expressing cells, suggesting that β-arrestin-bound ERK1/2 is protected from mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase activity. These data suggest that β-arrestin binding to GPCRs nucleates the formation of a stable “signalsome” that functions as a passive scaffold for the ERK1/2 cascade while confining ERK1/2 activity to an extranuclear compartment.

Seven membrane-spanning G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2; G protein, guanine nucleotide-binding protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, influenza virus hemagglutinin; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; NKA, neurokinin A; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; VASP, vasodilator- and A kinase-stimulated phosphoprotein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; NK1, neurokinin 1; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; MKP, MAP kinase phosphatase. constitute the largest superfamily of membrane receptors and transmit signals in response to an extraordinary array of extracellular stimuli. GPCRs function as ligand-activated guanine nucleotide exchange factors for heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding (G) proteins. GPCR-catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange on the Gα subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins leads to dissociation of GTP-bound Gα subunits from Gβγ heterodimers, each of which in turn positively or negatively regulates the activity of enzymatic effectors, such as adenylyl cyclases, phospholipase Cβ isoforms, and ion channels. This classic paradigm of GPCR signaling is sufficient to account for most of the rapid cellular responses to GPCR activation. However, GPCRs engage in numerous other protein-protein interactions that modulate the character and duration of G protein-mediated signaling or in some cases confer additional G protein-independent signaling capacity (1Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hall R.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 3Brady A.E. Limbird L.E. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Recently, the arrestins, a family of four GPCR-binding proteins originally discovered through their role in GPCR desensitization and sequestration, have emerged as important adaptors linking activated GPCRs to a number of cellular signaling systems. Arrestins are recruited to agonist-occupied GPCRs that have been phosphorylated on C-terminal Ser/Thr residues by G protein-coupled receptor kinases. Arrestin binding precludes receptor-G protein coupling, accounting for the phenomenon of homologous desensitization. In addition, the C termini of the two non-visual arrestins, β-arrestin 1 and 2, contain binding motifs for clathrin and the β2-adaptin subunit of the AP-2 complex that allow β-arrestins to target GPCRs for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (4Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 5Luttrell L.M. Devi L. The G Protein-Coupled Receptors Handbook. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ2005: 159-198Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Apart from their role in GPCR desensitization and sequestration, emerging data suggest that β-arrestins function as signal transducers in their own right. A number of catalytically active proteins bind β-arrestins and translocate with them to agonist-occupied GPCRs, among them Src family tyrosine kinases, components of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal Kinase 3 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades, the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Mdm2, and the cAMP phosphodiesterase, PDE4D. The agonist-induced assembly of these receptor-β-arrestin-effector complexes confers discrete enzymatic properties upon the receptor that appear to expand the repertoire of GPCR signaling (5Luttrell L.M.

J. 2003; 375: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). One of the most studied β-arrestin-dependent signals is activation of the ERK1/2 MAP kinase cascade. GPCRs employ several mechanisms to activate ERK1/2, including activation of classic G protein-regulated effectors such as protein kinase (PKA) and PKC, ectodomain shedding-dependent transactivation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors, and signals transmitted via β-arrestins (9Gutkind J.S.

Depending on receptor and cell type, one mechanism may predominate or multiple mechanisms may act concurrently. Interestingly, β-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2 activation appears to be G protein-independent, because it can be demonstrated under conditions where β-arrestin recruitment is induced in the absence of detectable G protein activation (12Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 13Azzi M. Charest P.G.

Transactivation of EGF receptors, a GPCR-mediated process that does not require β-arrestin (14Gesty-Palmer D. El Shewy H. Kohout T.A. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol.

Collectively, these data indicate that G protein-dependent and β-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2 activation are mechanistically distinct, produce ERK1/2 activation with different time courses and in different subcellular locations, and probably dictate different functional consequences of ERK1/2 activation. Little is known, however, about how agonist-promoted recruitment of β-arrestin to a GPCR leads to ERK1/2 activation, except that it can occur in the absence of heterotrimeric G protein activation. In one sense, a β-arrestin-bound GPCR might be thought of as a “signalsome nucleus” upon which a multiprotein signaling complex is assembled (5Luttrell L.M. Devi L. The G Protein-Coupled Receptors Handbook. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ2005: 159-198Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 6Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J.

J. 2003; 375: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Efforts to experimentally characterize the composition and function of this putative “signalsome” with respect to its role in ERK1/2 activation are faced with two experimental limitations. The first is that, because native GPCRs can employ multiple simultaneous or sequential mechanisms to activate ERK1/2, it is difficult to establish a model system in which β-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2 activation accounts for the majority of the observed ERK1/2 signal. The second is that it is difficult to isolate stoichiometric GPCR-β-arrestin complexes from detergent lysates for the purpose of identifying endogenous components of the GPCR signalsome. To circumvent these obstacles and provide an initial means of characterizing the composition and function of the GPCR-arrestin signalsome, we have compared the mechanism of ERK1/2 activation by wild-type human tachykinin NK1 receptors to that used by a “constitutively desensitized” NK1 receptor-β-arrestin1 chimera (NK1-βArr1) that generates robust constitutive ERK1/2 activity in the absence of increased G protein signaling. Our data suggest that β-arrestin-bound GPCRs increase cellular ERK1/2 activity primarily by functioning as passive scaffolds for the Raf-MEK-ERK kinase cascade that increase the efficiency of ERK1/2 phosphorylation while slowing the rate of ERK1/2 dephosphorylation.

Phosphorylated ERK1/2 and MEK1/2 were detected by immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 IgG and anti-phospho-MEK1/2 IgG, respectively, with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody. Total ERK1/2, measured to confirm equal loading of whole cell lysate samples, was detected using polyclonal anti-ERK1/2 IgG. Immune complexes were visualized on x-ray film by enzyme-linked chemiluminescence and quantified using a Fluor-S MultiImager. To assay endogenous PKA activity cells were cotransfected with wild-type NK1 receptor or NK1-β-arrestin1 and FLAG-VASP. VASP is a specific PKA substrate that undergoes a prominent electrophoretic mobility shift on SDS-PAGE when phosphorylated. FLAG-VASP in whole cell lysates was visualized by immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG IgG with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody. The effect of receptor expression and stimulation on endogenous PKA activity was quantified by measuring the fraction of total FLAG-VASP in each lane that was present in the slow migrating upper band. For detection of NK1-β-arrestin1 and wild-type NK1 receptor-associated proteins, 10-cm plates of appropriately transfected HEK-293 cells were stimulated as described, then solubilized in 1.0 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Base (pH 7.5), 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 100 μm benzaminidine) containing 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and immunoprecipitation was performed using 20 μl of 50% slurry of M2 anti-FLAG affinity agarose or HA-11 anti-HA affinity matrix, with constant agitation overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer prior to SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitated receptors and endogenous receptor-associated proteins were detected by immunoblotting with polyclonal IgG against the FLAG or HA epitopes, ubiquitin, β-arrestin1/2, cRaf-1, B-Raf, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, or phospho-ERK1/2 as appropriate. Quantitative Real-time PCR—The expression of Egr1 mRNA was measured by quantitative real-time PCR using an iCycler iQ™ Multicolor Real-time Detection System. Total RNA was isolated from cells with the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Applied Science), after which cDNA was synthesized from 0.1 μg of RNA using the iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). cDNAs amplified through one cycle by PCR using random hexamer DNA primers were used as templates for quantitative real-time PCR. Specific primer sets were designed to span intron-exon borders to distinguish amplified cDNA from genomic DNA. The primers used for Egr1 amplification were: sense, 5′-GATGATGCTGTGACAATAAG-3′ EGR1; antisense, 5′-TACGGTCAAGCAGTATTTAC-3′. The expression level of Egr1 from each sample was normalized to the mRNA expression level of a housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—For visualization of HA-NK1 or FLAG-NK1-βArr1 receptors in intact cells, transfected HEK-293 cells grown on collagen-coated glass bottom chamber slides were incubated for 1 h with a 1:100 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG or anti-HA IgG in serum-free medium prior to fixation for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of AlexaFluor 543 goat anti-rabbit IgG in blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature, washed again, and examined. For visualization under permeabilized conditions, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. Receptors were stained overnight at 4 °C using a 1:1000 dilution of either anti-FLAG or anti-HA IgG followed by a 1:250 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at room temperature. For visualization of endogenous phospho-ERK1/2, transfected cells were stimulated as described, formalin-fixed, and permeabilized. Phospho-ERK1/2 was stained overnight using a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2. Monolayers were then incubated with a 1:250 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at room temperature prior to final washing and examination. For visualization of the nuclear translocation of ERK2, cells coexpressing wild-type NK1 or NK1-βArr1 receptors and GFP-ERK2 were stimulated as described and formalin-fixed, and random fields were examined. In each sample, ToPro3 was used as a nuclear counterstain to identify those cells in the field in which the confocal imaging plane accurately transected the nucleus. To quantify changes in the nuclear distribution of GFP-ERK2, National Institutes of Health ImageJ software was employed to determine the ratio of nuclear to cytosolic GFP fluorescence in at least 20 individual cells under each condition in each experiment. Data were normalized such that the mean nucleus:cytosol ratio in wild-type NK1 receptor-expressing cells under nonstimulated conditions was arbitrarily defined as 1.0. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS laser scanning microscope using dual channel excitation (495 nm Alexa Flour 488 and GFP; 642 nm ToPro3) and emission (519 nm Alexa Flour 488 and GFP; 657 nm ToPro3) filter sets. Expression of a Constitutively Desensitized Chimeric NK1-β-arrestin1 Receptor Causes Sustained Activation of a Cytosolic Pool of ERK1/2—Fig. 1A schematically depicts the membrane topography of the HA-tagged human tachykinin NK1 receptor and the FLAG-tagged NK1-βArr1 chimera. NK1-βArr1 consists of the human NK1 receptor with full-length bovine β-arrestin1 (amino acids 1-418) fused in-frame immediately following the receptor C terminus. As shown in Fig. 1B, NK1 receptor in anti-HA immunoprecipitates from transiently transfected HEK-293 cells appeared as multiple bands of >50-55 kDa apparent molecular mass on anti-HA immunoblots, probably due to variable receptor glycosylation. In anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates, NK1-βArr1 appeared as a group of >100-kDa bands that immunoblotted for both FLAG epitope and β-arrestin. Interestingly, both NK1 and NK1-βArr1 immunoprecipitates contained a small amount of endogenous β-arrestin, due either to binding to intracellular receptor domains or to dimerization between endogenous β-arrestin and the β-arrestin1 moiety of the NK1-βArr1 chimera (25Schubert C.

The ligand-binding, G protein-coupling, and intracellular trafficking properties of both the NK1 receptor and NK1-βArr1 have been characterized in detail (29Martini L. Hastrup H. Holst B.

Cell. 1998; 9: 2305-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The NK1 receptor binds two endogenous peptide ligands, substance P and NKA, and stimulates robust cAMP production and phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis through coupling to Gs and Gq/11, respectively. The NK1-βArr1 chimera also binds to substance P and NKA with high affinity but exhibits markedly impaired G protein coupling due to the proximity of the intrinsic β-arrestin moiety to the intracellular receptor domains involved in G protein activation. In cells expressing NK1-βArr1, agonist exposure fails to elicit a detectable cAMP response, and production of inositol phosphates is <3% that of the wild-type receptor (29Martini L. Hastrup H. Holst B. Fraile-Ramos A. Marsh M. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C depicts the cellular distribution of NK1 receptor and NK1-βArr1 expressed in HEK-293 cells as determined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Nonpermeabilized cells expressing NK1 receptor exhibited strong surface staining for HA-epitope, consistent receptor expression on the plasma membrane. In contrast, nonpermeabilized NK1-βArr1-expressing cells exhibited minimal cell-surface FLAG-epitope staining. Both receptors showed diffuse staining following membrane permeabilization. This agrees with published work demonstrating that NK1-βArr1 undergoes constitutive β-arrestin-dependent endocytosis and resides primarily resides within recycling endosomes (29Martini L. Hastrup H. Holst B. Fraile-Ramos A. Marsh M. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the fusion of β-arrestin1 to the NK1 receptor causes it to behave as a constitutively desensitized receptor, uncoupled from heterotrimeric G proteins and sequestered off the plasma membrane in an intracellular compartment. Fig. 2 depicts the effect of NK1 receptor and NK1-βArr1 expression on ERK1/2 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 2A, 5-min exposure of NK1 receptor-expressing cells to NKA increased endogenous ERK1/2 phosphorylation to an extent comparable to that observed following treatment with a maximally efficacious concentration of PMA, which stimulates PKC-dependent ERK1/2 activation (33Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows the results of the identical experiment performed on cells expressing NK1-βArr1. In these cells, basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation was markedly elevated and was not further increased either by exposure to either NKA or PMA. In both NK1 receptor- and NK1-βArr1-expressing cells, 30-min incubation with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation to a similar minimally detectable level. Although the wild-type NK1 receptor behaved as a typical membrane-localized GPCR with respect to agonist responsiveness, NK1-βArr1 expression alone was sufficient to produce near maximal ERK1/2 phosphorylation, as evidenced by the failure of PMA to generate a further increase. This constitutive activation of the ERK1/2 cascade contrasts dramatically with the constitutive desensitization of G protein signaling and intracellular sequestration of the chimera. The failure of NK1-βArr1 to respond to NKA probably reflects a combination of factors; the high level of basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation elicited by the chimera, the ability of the intrinsic β-arrestin moiety to preclude G protein coupling, and the fact the NK1-βArr1 is sequestered intracellularly, where it is not accessible to peptide ligands. To determine whether NK1 receptor and NK1-βArr1 differentially affected the cellular distribution of active ERK1/2, we examined the distribution of endogenous phospho-ERK1/2 by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3A, HEK-293 cells expressing NK1 receptors exhibited minimal phospho-ERK1/2 staining in the absence of agonist. Exposure to NKA for 5 min increased phospho-ERK1/2 staining, primarily within the cytosol, and a modest increase of nuclear staining was apparent. Treatment with PMA produced a similar pattern of cytosolic and nuclear phospho-ERK1/2 staining. Fig. 3B shows"

Using saturation mutagenesis, we investigated the role of a conserved residue (Arg526) at the active site of acylaminoacyl peptidase from hyperthermophilic Aeropyrum pernix K1 in substrate discrimination and catalytic mechanism. This enzyme has both peptidase and esterase activities. The esterase activity of the wild-type enzyme with p-nitrophenyl caprylate as substrate is ∼7 times higher than the peptidase activity with Ac-Leu-p-nitroanilide as substrate. However, with the same substrates, this difference was increased to ∼150-fold for mutant R526V. A more dramatic effect occurred with mutant R526E, which essentially completely abolished the peptidase activity but decreased the esterase activity only by a factor of 2, leading to a 785-fold difference in the enzyme activities. These results provide rare examples that illustrate how enzymes can be evolved to discriminate their substrates by a single mutation. The possible structural and energetic effects of the mutations on kcat and Km of the enzyme were discussed based on molecular dynamics simulation studies.

The POP family is a relatively new group of serine peptidases and different from the classic serine proteases, trypsin and subtilisin, in several structural features and catalytic behaviors (4Szeltner Z. Rea D. Renner V. Juliano L. Fülöp V. Polgár L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48786-48793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 5Rennex D. Hemmings B.A. Hofsteenge J.

Compared with the classic serine protease, the members of the new family are more similar to lipase: (i) the members of the POP family contain a canonical α/β hydrolase fold, and the catalytic triad is covered by an unusual seven-bladed β-propeller (1Rawlings N.D. Polgár L. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 907-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) the enzymes share the same sequence order of catalytic residues (Ser...Asp... His) with lipase, which is different from that of the well known trypsin (His... Asp... Ser) and subtilisin (Asp... His... Ser); (iii) the POP family shares the same Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly motif with lipase (9Polgár L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Polgár's group has studied the structural and evolutionary relationship between the POP family and the microbial lipase family by comparing the segment near the catalytic residues (9Polgár L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). There is no significant sequence homology between lipases and peptidases, except for a 10-residue segment near the catalytic Ser. However, these two families have similar catalytic triads and a partially opened active site. In fact, APH shows comparable peptidase and esterase activities; it can catalyze both the removal of an N-acylated amino acid from blocked peptides and an acyl chain from esters. An understanding of the determinant for the peptidase and esterase activities of APH is an interesting issue, which may provide us with more information about the molecular evolution of the POP family.The putative APH gene (APE1547) from the thermophilic archaeon Aeropyrum pernix K1 has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein (apAPH) has been purified and characterized (10Gao R. Feng Y. Ishikawa K. Ishida H. Ando S. Kosugi Y. Cao S. J. Mol. Catal., B Enzym. 2003; 24: 1-8Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The enzyme shows an optimal temperature at 90 °C for enzyme activity and is extremely stable. The recombinant protein showed hydrolytic activity for a wide range of substrates, including p-nitrophenyl alkanoate esters of varying alkyl chain lengths, p-nitroanilide (pNA)-labeled amino acids, and peptides. Of a series of Ac-amino acid-pNAs tested, apAPH shows the highest activity for Ac-Leu-pNA. In an earlier study, the maximal esterase activity has been observed for the substrate p-nitrophenyl caprylate (pNPC8) (10Gao R. Feng Y. Ishikawa K. Ishida H. Ando S. Kosugi Y. Cao S. J. Mol. Catal., B Enzym. 2003; 24: 1-8Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Both optimum substrates have bulky hydrophobic side chains. Recently, we have determined the crystal structure of apAPH complexed with an organophosphorus substrate (11Bartlam M. Wang G. Yang H. Gao R. Zhao X. Xie G. Cao S. Feng Y. Rao Z. Structure. 2004; 12: 1481-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which is the first available APH structure. The structure of the complex unambiguously maps out the substrate binding pocket and the conserved Ser445-Asp524-His556 catalytic triad. The substrate binding pocket has a hydrophobic environment, which provides an explanation for the substrate preference of apAPH for hydrophobic side chains. The putative S2 pocket is also a hydrophobic environment and is particularly rich in phenylalanines (Phe153, Phe155, Phe163, and Phe371). Arg526 is located in the S2 site, which is structurally equivalent to Arg125 in dipeptidyl peptidase IV and Arg643 in POP. The Arg526, which is adjacent to the catalytic residue Asp524, is completely conserved among all APHs. There is an obvious bias toward Arg at this position in the whole POP family (12Venäläinen J.I. Juvonen R.O. Männistö P.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2705-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas Leu is favored at the same position in the hormone-sensitive lipase family (Table 1). The special location and the high conservation suggest that residue 526 may play a crucial role in substrate recognition and/or transition state stabilization.TABLE 1Sequence alignment of amino acids around Arg526 for major representatives of APH, POP, and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL)EnzymeResidue numberaResidue numbering according to apAPH524525526527528APHs A. pernix K1AspSerArgThrPhe Caenorhabditis elegansAspLeuArgValVal Rat liverAspArgArgValPhe Human erythrocytesAspArgArgValPhe Basillus subtilisAspAspArgCysPhe Fugu rubribesAspLysArgValPhePOPs Pyrococcus horikoshiiAspAspArgValHis Porcine brainAspAspArgValVal Bovine brainAspAspArgValVal Arabidopsis thalianaAspAspArgValValHSLs2AFEST, A. fulgidus ester; BFAE, Bacillus acidocaldarius ester; YBAC, E. coli esterase; MOL, Moraxella TA144 lipase; HSL, human hormone-sensitive lipase AFESTAspPheLeuArgAsp BFAEAspPheLeuArgAsp EST2AspPheLeuArgAsp HSLAspPheMetLeuAsp YBACAspPheLeuLeuAsp MOLAspIleLeuArgAspa Residue numbering according to apAPHb AFEST, A. fulgidus ester; BFAE, Bacillus acidocaldarius ester; YBAC, E. coli esterase; MOL, Moraxella TA144 lipase; HSL, human hormone-sensitive lipase Open table in a new tab The role of Arg526 counterparts in the prolyl oligopeptidase subfamily has been addressed in earlier studies. Crystal structures of prolyl oligopeptidase-substrate complexes from porcine muscle reveal that Arg involves itself in substrate binding by forming a hydrogen bond between the guanidine group and the main chain carbonyl group of the substrate (13Fülöp V. Szeltner Z. Renner V. Polgár L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1262-1282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Arg526 pulls the negatively charged substrate away from the catalytically competent position (4Szeltner Z. Rea D. Renner V. Juliano L. Fülöp V. Polgár L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48786-48793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Moreover, structure-based mutagenesis of the Myxococcus xanthus prolyl oligopeptidase has revealed that Arg526 is involved in a salt bridge that acts as a latch for opening or closing the enzyme, and Arg526 also helps to secure the incoming peptide substrate to the open form of the enzyme (14Shan L. Mathews I.I. Khosla C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2005; 102: 3599-3604Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The mutants R526A and R526Q showed a 4-5-fold increase in Km. However, previous studies on this potential substrate-binding residue have not addressed how mutations affect the APH substrate specificity and the role of the Arg526 in the evolution relationship between peptidase and esterase.Here, we performed saturation mutagenesis, in which the Arg526 was mutated to all other 19 amino acids, to investigate the importance of this residue in apAPH as well as its potential role in the POP family. High throughput screenings for both peptidase and esterase activities were undertaken with Ac-Leu-pNA and pNPC8 as substrates, respectively. Further kinetic studies of individual steps allow a deeper insight into the mechanism of mutation effect on substrate recognition and enzyme catalysis. Finally, molecular modeling studies of several mutants were carried out to elucidate the possible structural basis for the conversion of peptidase to esterase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents, Bacterial Strain, and Plasmid—Restriction enzyme DpnI was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Pfu DNA polymerase was purchased from Stratagene (Madison, WI). Ampicillin and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were obtained from TaKaRa Shuzo (Otsu, Shiga, Japan). The substrate Ac-Leu-pNA was purchased from Sigma, and pNPC8 were purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Other chemicals were reagent grade. Vector pET-15b and E. coli strain BL 21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL, which were used for cloning and expression, were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI).Oligonucleotides and Saturation Mutagenesis—Oligonucleotide primers used for saturation mutagenesis were synthesized by Bio-Basic (Shanghai, China). The R526X mutants of apAPH were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (15Zheng L. Baumann U. Reymond J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e115Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). The codon for residue 526 is randomized by the whole plasmid PCR using Pfu polymerase. The oligonucleotides used as forward and reverse primers were as follows: R526X_f (5′GAACGACAGCNNKACACCGCTGA-3′); R526X_r (5′-TCAGCGGTGTKNNGCTGTCGTTC-3′). Here N represents any of the following A, T, G, or C. K represents G or T. The reaction used 16 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 18 min. After the amplification, the reaction was further incubated at 72 °C for 30 min and stored at 4 °C. 2 units of DpnI was then added into the final PCR solution, which was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to eliminate the methylated template. The PCR product was transformed into freshly prepared competent E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL by electroporation with a gene pulser (Bio-Rad).Clones growing on 2YT plates were picked with a sterile toothpick into 96-well plates, which was filled with 200 μl of 2YT containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were cultured by shaking the plates overnight at 37 °C. The plates were duplicated by transferring 5 μl of culture from each well into a new plate containing fresh medium and antibiotic. The original plates were stored, and the duplicated plates were shaken for an additional 3 h for cell growth. Then the cells were induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 6 h of induction at 30 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 30 min and readied for screening.Screening of Mutant Libraries for Peptidase and Esterase Activities— The harvested cells were frozen and then thawed three times to release the enzyme and then resuspended in 200 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The turbidity of each well was measured at 600 nm by a Multiskan Ascent 96-well plate reader (Thermolabsystems, Franklin, MA). Crude bacterial extracts were subjected to heat incubation at 80 °C for 30 min and centrifuged in order to remove the heat-induced aggregated proteins. A 20-μl aliquot from each well was pipetted into a new 96-well plate, to which 200 μl of substrate solution containing 0.2 mm Ac-Leu-pNA or pNPC8 in 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 8.0 was added.The peptidase activity of apAPH was measured spectrophotometrically by the release of the p-nitroaniline from Ac-Leu-pNA. Hydrolysis of the substrate was performed for 10-20 min at 80 °C. The amount of released p-nitroaniline was determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. The value of A405 of each well was normalized by the corresponding A600, and the ratio r = A405/A600 was used to estimate the activity of each clone.The esterase activity of apAPH was measured by the release of p-nitrophenyl from pNPC8, which was released in a way similar to that described for the hydrolysis of Ac-Leu-pNA.Protein Purification and Enzyme Assays—Wild-type apAPH protein and variants were expressed in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL. The cells were harvested and suspended in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. After ultrasonic cell disintegration, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 30 min. The cytosolic fraction was heated at 80 °C for 30 min and centrifuged to remove heat-induced aggregated proteins. The supernatant was subjected to nickel-chelating chromatography. Fractions containing apAPH activity were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) overnight. The N-terminal His tag was cleaved using thrombin, as described in the pET system manual (Novagen, Madison, WI). The protein concentration was determined according to the Bradford method, and bovine serum albumin was used as the standard.The peptidase and esterase activities were determined with Ac-Leu-pNA and pNPC8 as substrates, respectively. Enzyme assays were according to the method previously described (10Gao R. Feng Y. Ishikawa K. Ishida H. Ando S. Kosugi Y. Cao S. J. Mol. Catal., B Enzym. 2003; 24: 1-8Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar), except that the enzyme was assayed in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) instead of the Tris-HCl buffer.Measurement of Steady-state Kinetics—The kinetic parameters Km and kcat of wild type and the mutants were determined at 80 °C for Ac-Leu-pNA and pNPC8. The initial steady-state velocities of substrate hydrolysis were monitored for a minimum of six substrate concentrations. The following substrate concentration ranges were used: Ac-Leu-pNA (200-2000 μm) and pNPC8 (20-200 μm). The kinetic parameters were determined from the rates of hydrolysis by fitting the rates to a Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plot. All kinetic data were analyzed by linear regression using Microcal Origin 6.0. The S.E. value of each parameter was estimated from the curve fitting.Determination of Individual Rate Constants and Activation Energies for Hydrolysis of pNPC8 and Ac-Leu-pNA—Individual rate constants defining the mechanism of substrate hydrolysis were extracted from the values of kcat/Km obtained as a function of temperature from 40 to 90 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 8.0. The kcat/Km was determined under first-order conditions (i.e. at substrate concentrations lower than Km)by using kcat/Km = V0/[E][S]. All measurements were done in duplicates or triplicates, and the results for kinetic data were the mean of at least two independent experiments.The substrate hydrolysis of Ser protease starts with the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex ES with a second-order rate constant k1. After that, the substrate can either dissociate back into the solution with a rate constant k-1, or react with the enzyme to form the acyl-enzyme complex EP with a rate constant k2. The product P′ is released at this step. At last, the acyl-enzyme complex EP is hydrolyzed, and the other portion of substrate P″ is released with a rate constant k3 (16Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1589-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The series of events of the mechanism can be defined as follows. E+Sk1⇌k−1ESk2⇀EP+Pk2⇀E+p“SCHEME 1 The individual rate constants in Scheme 1 are related to the experimental values of Km and kcat by the following equations. s=kcatKm=k1k2k−1+k2 (Eq. 1) kcat=k2k3k2+k3(Eq. 2) Because the Michaelis-Menten parameters s and kcat are composite functions of the individual kinetic rates in Scheme 1, measurements of s and kcat as a function of temperature can resolve all of the parameters from Equations 3 and 4 (16Ayala Y.M.

From the temperature dependence of s and kcat, all of the parameters involved in Equations 3 and 4 can be obtained. Because T can be set to any temperature, the parameters can be calculated for various temperatures.The specificity constant s is the same as k1 when k2 is >>k-1 and is equal to k1k2/k-1 when k-1 is >>k2. In the former limit, the slope in the ln s versus 1/T plot is E-1/R, whereas in the latter, the slope is (E-1-E1-E2/R). Processes with low activation energy, like substrate diffusion into the active site or acylation, predominate at low temperatures, where k2 becomes much larger than k-1, and s becomes equal to k1. On the other hand, substrate dissociation has a higher activation energy and becomes predominant at high temperatures, where s = k1k2/k-1. The plot of ln s versus 1/T at low temperature allows the determination of k1 and E1, whereas k1k2/k-1 and E-1-E1-E2 can be determined at high temperature. The curvature in the plot allows for determination of the four terms (k1, k2/k-2, E-1, and E-1-E2) in Equation 3 with the best fit parameters derived from the nonlinear least squares method using Microcal Origin 6.0. kcat is k2 for both ester and peptide substrates (see “Results”). Together with the kcat obtained from the kinetic assay, the determination of all five parameters (k1, k2, k-1, E-1, and E-1-E2) can be made.Molecular Modeling—All computations were performed with the InsightII package, version 2000 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The BIOPOLYMER module was used to create substrate molecular structures. All energy minimizations and molecular dynamics were performed with the DISCOVER module using the consistent valence force field. The 1.8-Å crystallographic structure of apAPH was used as the starting coordinates for calculations (Protein Data Bank code 1VE6). Hydrogen atoms were added according to the normal ionization state of the amino acids at pH 8.0. The atomic potentials were fixed according to the consistent valence force field atom types recommended by the manufacturer.The advanced docking program, Affinity, was used to perform the automated molecular docking for ester substrate pNPC8. This procedure combines Monte Carlo and simulated annealing to dock a guest molecule with a host. The docked complexes of apAPH and ligands were selected according to the criteria of interacting energy combined with geometrical matching quality. Peptide substrate Ac-Leu-pNA was manually docked into the binding site of the enzymes and was oriented with the P1 Leu in the S1 pocket and Ac-O toward the Arg526. The selected pNPC8·apAPH and Ac-Leu-pNA·apAPH from the docking studies were subjected to energetic minimization before being used as the starting points for subsequent calculations.Mutations were introduced with all mutant residues kept in the same orientation as their wild-type counterparts. Residues contained in a simulation area within 15 Å from atom Nϵ of His556 were allowed to move with the rest of the protein being fixed. A layer of 5 Å of explicit water was added to the surface of the assembly, and a nonbonded cut-off of 20 Å was fixed to reduce the time of calculation. Each structure was energy-minimized by applying 100 steps using the steepest descent method and followed by a conjugate gradient minimization procedure until a convergence of 0.001 kcal mol-1Å-1 was reached. A short molecular dynamics simulation was performed starting from the energy-minimized structures for 100 fs at 310 K to allow equilibration at 310 K. The actual simulation to explore conformational space was performed for 100 ps at the same temperature (time step = 1 fs). Snapshots were taken each picosecond to generate 101 different conformers. The trajectories obtained for each mutant were analyzed.RESULTSSaturation Mutagenesis and Screening Activities of both Esterase and Peptidase—Saturation mutagenesis was performed at position Arg526 using the modified QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol as described under “Experimental Procedures.” With this approach, a random codon was introduced in a single PCR with one pair of complementary primer containing all possible mutations. We took advantage of the availability of the 96-microtiter well plate assay for the rapid screening for both esterase and peptidase activities of mutants. More than 200 clones from the saturation mutagenesis library were screened to ensure the probability that all 32 possible codons were covered with no less than 99% (20Rui L. Kwon Y. Fishman A. Reardon K.F. Wood T.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 3246-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To obtain the high screening sensibility, the optimal substrates for peptidase and esterase activities, which are Ac-Leu-pNA and pNPC8, respectively, were chosen based on the compounds that were tested in our earlier studies.The mutation library showed strikingly different effects on these two kinds of substrates. Nearly all mutants display a decreased peptidase activity with Ac-Leu-pNA as substrate. More than 80% of the clones showed an activity less than 20% of the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, they exhibited higher activity for pNPC8. More than 90% of the clones showed esterase activity higher than the wild-type enzymes. Meanwhile, about 12% of the clones have activity more than 5-fold of the wild-type enzymes. These results suggest that residue 526 plays an important role in determining the peptidase and esterase activity of apAPH.Steady-state Kinetic Analysis at 80 °C—The clones with obvious activity changes were sequenced. The screening data led us to identify specific mutants of interest for further enzymatic characterization. The hydrophobic Leu, Ile, and Val were chosen because they induced a significant increase in esterase activities (5-7-fold). Meanwhile, the least conserved R526E was chosen, because it is the most inactive variant for both Ac-Leu-pNA and pNPC8. Ala has the smallest side chain, which could be used as a minimum reference to study the function of the other side chains. Lys, positively charged as Arg, could provide information on the electrostatic effects on the enzyme activity.The kinetic parameters for wild-type apAPH and the selected mutants are shown in Table 2. All of the R526X mutants have reduced peptidase activity as measured by Ac-Leu-pNA hydrolysis. Generally speaking, the reduced activities are due to significant increases in Km rather than kcat, although the kcat of R526E is dramatically decreased. The Km of R526A is higher than the mutants with bulky hydrophobic side chains, such as R526V, R526I, and R526L, suggesting that larger bulky hydrophobic side chains play a significant role in substrate binding. The charged mutants at this position changed the Km most significantly; R526K and R526E had 25- and 14-fold increases in Km, respectively. In addition, these two residues also have effects on kcat. The positively charged R526K increased the kcat by 3-fold, whereas the negatively charged R526E reduced the kcat by 2 orders of magnitude.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters for wild type and mutant apAPHs The kinetic parameters were determined according to the Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plot.

This could be caused by its unique guanidine group rather than by the positive charge, since the Lys side chain is also positively charged.All mutants showed an increased esterase activity with substrate pNPC8, except that the R526E mutant decreases the activity slightly. The increase in esterase activity of the mutants is attributed to the increase in kcat, since the Km is in the same range as the native enzyme (Table 2). These results indicate that the substitutions at this position affect the catalysis but not the substrate binding. The large hydrophobic mutants (Ile, Leu, and Val) increased the catalytic efficiency by 3.4-5.7-fold. R526K and R526A showed a small increase of 50-60%. It is worth noting that the R526E shows a Km that is 2.6 times larger than the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that its negatively charged side chain might interfere with the substrate binding and decrease the affinity between the enzyme and pNPC8.The R526X mutants showed increased esterase activity and decreased peptidase activity, respectively. Therefore, their specificity toward two types of substrates has dramatically changed (Fig. 1). The ratio of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) between esterase substrate and peptidase substrate for each mutant becomes much larger than the wild type. In the case of R526V, the esterase activity becomes ∼150 times higher than the peptidase activity. A more dramatic effect occurred with mutant R526E, which essentially completely abolished the peptidase activity but decreased the esterase activity only by a factor of 2, leading to a 785-fold difference in the two enzyme activities. The above results unambiguously confirmed the importance of position 526 in substrate discrimination and illustrate that enzymes can be evolved to discriminate their substrates by a single mutation.Reaction Mechanism Revealed by Individual Kinetic Constants—To gain a deeper insight into the catalytic role of the mutants, the wild-type apAPH and the Val, Glu, Lys, and Ala mut"

Low PS levels are a risk factor for the development of deep venous thrombosis. The regulation of PS levels through transcriptional regulation of the PS gene was investigated in this report. A minimal PS gene promoter 370 bp upstream from the translational initiation codon was sufficient for maximal promoter activity in transient transfections regardless of the cell type. A pivotal role for Sp1 in the constitutive expression of the PS gene was demonstrated through electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments, transient expression of mutant PS promoter-reporter gene constructs, and chromatin immunoprecipitations in HepG2 cells. At least four Sp-binding sites were identified. The two sites most proximal to the translational start codon were found to be indispensable for PS promoter activity, whereas mutation of the two most distal Sp-binding sites had a negligible influence on basal promoter activity. In addition, all other major promoter-binding proteins that were found by electrophoretic mobility shift assay could be positively identified in supershift assays. We identified binding sites for the hepatocyte-specific forkhead transcription factor FOXA2, nuclear factor Y, and the cAMP-response element-binding protein/activating transcription factor family of transcription factors.

Over the past two decades low PS plasma levels have become a well established risk factor for the development of deep venous thrombosis (11Schwarz H.P. Fischer M. Hopmeier P. Batard M.A. Griffin J.H.

Hereditary PS deficiency has been shown to be an autosomal dominant trait, and many causative genetic mutations have been described in the PS gene (14Gandrille S. Borgel D. Ireland H. Lane D.A.

On the other hand, PS deficiency can also be acquired throughout life by conditions such as oral contraceptive use and liver disease (16D'Angelo A. Vigano-D'Angelo S. Esmon C.T. Comp P.C. J. Clin.

To better understand the different functions of PS and the possible causes of PS deficiency, more information is needed on the regulation of the PS gene, mRNA, and protein. The major source of circulating plasma PS is the hepatocyte (17Fair D.S. Marlar R.A.

The PS genetic locus, PROS, consists of an active PS gene (PROS1) and an inactive pseudogene (PROS2) that share 96% homology in their coding sequence. The promoter and the first exon are absent from the PROS2 gene, however (29Schmidel D.K. Tatro A.V. Phelps L.G. Tomczak J.A. Long G.L.

Vos H.L. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 3: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and recently the PROS1 promoter was shown to contain a forkhead box A2 (FOXA2)-binding site and an Sp1-binding site (33Tatewaki H. Tsuda H. Kanaji T. Yokoyama K. Hamasaki N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 90: 1029-1039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we further characterized the transcriptional regulation of the PROS1 promoter. We identified binding sites for various transcription factors within the first 400 bp proximal to the PROS1 translational start codon, among which are multiple binding sites for the ubiquitous transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3, single sites for nuclear factor Y (NFY), and the cAMP-response element-binding protein/activating transcription factor (CREB/ATF) family of transcription factors. Chromatin immunoprecipitations of chromatin from hepatocytic cell line HepG2 with an Sp1 antibody demonstrated the in vivo relevance of our findings. The results presented here show that Sp1 and Sp3 have a crucial role in the basal expression of the PS gene, whereas transcription factors FOXA2, NFY, and CREB/ATF do not. Plasmids—The PROS1 promoter reporter constructs used in this study originated from a 7-kb EcoRI promoter fragment that was isolated from BAC clone 2513H18 from the CITBI-E1 genomic library (Research Genetics, Invitrogen). The complete sequence was determined through automated sequencing (ABI PRISM and Beckman CEQ2000 sequencers) and deposited in GenBank™ under accession number AY605182. The PROS1 sequence was cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and modified to contain nucleotides –5948 to –1 from the translational start codon. PROS1 fragment –5948/–1 was cloned directly 5′ to the luciferase reporter gene in the pGL3basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) after digestion with KpnI and XhoI that cut in the multiple cloning site. This construct was named PS5948-luc (contact authors for exact cloning details). PS5948-luc was linearized with KpnI and NdeI (at position –5798 in the promoter sequence) and was subsequently subjected to exonuclease III digestion (Erase-a-Base kit, Promega). The size of the resulting 5′-deletion was determined by sequence analysis. The 5′-deletion constructs were used for transient transfection assays. Mutation of Putative Transcription Factor Binding Sites—Mutant constructs were generated by use of the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA).

Holthuizen (University of Utrecht, Netherlands). The pcDNA3-FOXA2 vector was created by inserting the cDNA for FOXA2, as reported by Lai and co-workers (36Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Tao W.F. Chen W.S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), into the EcoRI cloning site of vector pcDNA3. Cell Culture—Leukocytes isolated from blood obtained from healthy donors (Sanquin Bloodbank, Leiden, Netherlands) were a kind gift from E. Paffen (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands). The human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2 and cervical adenocarcinoma cell line HeLa were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Megakaryocytic cell line Meg01 was a kind gift from G. van Willigen (Utrecht Medical Center, Utrecht, Netherlands). The hepatoma cell line HuH7 was a kind gift from M. Verschuur (TNO Prevention and Health, Leiden, Netherlands). Primary human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVEC) cells were a kind gift from J. Grimbergen (TNO Prevention and Health, Leiden, Netherlands). HepG2, HeLa, and HuH7 cells were grown in minimal essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1× minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids (all purchased from Invitrogen). Meg01 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium, 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all purchased from Invitrogen). HUVECs were grown in M199 medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), 10% heat-inactivated human serum (Sanquin Bloodbank), 10% newborn calf serum (TNO Prevention and Health), 10 units/ml heparin (BioWhittaker), 150 units/ml endothelial cell growth factor, 100 μg/ml penicillin (BioWhittaker), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (BioWhittaker). 24 h before transfection, HUVEC medium was replaced with heparin-free medium to prevent interference with the transfection. PS Measurements—Total PS antigen levels in culture media were determined by ELISA as described previously (37Deutz-Terlouw P.P. Ballering L. van Wijngaarden A. Bertina R.M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1990; 186: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. ELISA plates were coated with goat anti-human PS IgG (Kordia, Leiden, The Netherlands) overnight at 4 °C. A second coating with 2.5% ovalbumin (Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 h was performed to reduce background absorbance. Complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Absorbance at 450 nm was determined with an Organon Teknika plate reader (Turnhout, Belgium). Reporter Gene Assays—1 × 106 Meg01 suspension cells were used per transfection. All adherent cells (HepG2, HuH7, HeLa, and HUVEC) were transfected at 60–80% confluency. HUVEC cells were transfected in passage 2–3, whereas the other cell types were used up to passage 25. Each transfection was performed in triplicate in 12-well plates. All assays were conducted with two different DNA preparations of each construct. Transfections in HepG2, HeLa, HUVEC, and HuH7 cells were carried out using 3 μl of Tfx-20 lipids (Promega) per μg of transfected DNA. Meg01 cells were transfected using 5 μg of DAC-30 (Eurogentec, Seraing, BE) per μg of DNA. In each transfection an equimolar concentration of construct was used, supplemented with pUC13-MCS vector to obtain a fixed amount of transfected DNA. In pUC13-MCS the MCS had been removed by digestion with PvuII and recircularization. Control vector pRL-SV40 (Promega), expressing the Renilla luciferase, was co-transfected to correct for transfection efficiency in a 1:500 ratio to the total transfected amount (microgram) of DNA in HepG2, HuH7, and HeLa cell lines, and a 1:100 ratio in transfections with HUVEC and Meg01 cells. 250 ng of transcription factor expression vector was used for co-transfections, and expression vector without the transcription factor cDNA was used as a negative control. Cell extracts were harvested at either 24 (HepG2 and HuH7) or 48 h (Meg01, HUVEC, and HeLa) after transfection. Cells were lysed in 250 μl of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) per well, after which 20–100 μl was used to measure luciferase activity. Luciferase activity was measured according to the Dual Luciferase Assay System Protocol (Promega) using a Lumat LB9507 luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts (NE) were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (38Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). Nuclear extract buffer contained 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). NEs were aliquoted and frozen at –80 °C until further use. Protein concentration of the NEs was measured with the BCA assay (Pierce). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—EMSAs were performed in a 13-μl binding reaction containing 10 μg of NE and 195 ng of denatured herring sperm DNA. EMSA buffers were purchased from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA) and used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The position numbers for the oligonucleotides in Fig. 2 show their location respective to the PROS1 translational start codon. Reaction mixtures were incubated on ice for 20 min with or without an unlabeled competitor. Subsequently, the 32P-labeled double-stranded probe was added, and the incubation was continued for another 20 min. In supershift experiments, NE was incubated on ice for 10 min with the 32P-labeled double-stranded probe after which an anti-Sp1 (sc59x), anti-Sp3 (sc664x), anti-NFYA (sc7711x), anti-CREB/ATF (sc270x), or anti-FOXA2 antibody (sc6554x) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added, and the incubation was allowed to continue for another 10 min. Samples were loaded on a 3 or 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, which was electrophoresed for 2 h at 200V, after which gels were vacuum-dried and exposed to x-ray film. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP)—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were conducted with chromatin isolated from HepG2 cells with the Chip-IT kit (Active Motif, Rixensart, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, HepG2 cells were grown to 80% confluency in 75-cm2 flasks after which chromatin was fixed in vivo by addition of 1% formaldehyde in culture medium. Fixed chromatin was isolated and sheared five times for 20 s to an average fragment size of 500 bp using a Soniprep 150 homogenizer (Sanyo/MSE, Kent, UK) at 25% power. Approximately 20 μg of sheared chromatin was incubated for 4 h with 3 μg of transcription factor-specific antibody at 4 °C with gentle rotation, after which protein G beads were added, and the incubation was continued overnight. An antibody against TFIIB was used as a positive control, and nonspecific IgG was used as a negative control. The same Sp1 antibody was used for the ChIP experiments as for the supershift assays. The antibody-chromatin complexes on the protein G beads were pelleted, washed extensively, eluted from the protein G beads, and treated with proteinase K and RNase A. DNA was purified over a mini-column and resuspended in 100 μl of H2O. 3 μl was used as a template for PCR using primers surrounding the suspected transcription factor binding site. For the PROS1-specific PCR the following primers were used: –322/–299 (sense) 5′-GGA GGA AAA GCA GCA ACT AGG GAG-3′, –91/–106 (antisense) 5′-TCG GTC TGA GCC GTG-3′. For the positive control primers located in the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) promoter were used. The background control consisted of a PCR with primers located in the chromosome condensation-related SMC-associated protein (CNAP1) gene. Protein S Expression in Cell Lines—Protein S levels in cell culture medium were determined by ELISA analysis for HepG2, HuH7, HeLa, Meg01, and HUVEC cells (Table 2). Hepatocytic cell types HuH7 and HepG2 had the highest PS production. PS levels in HeLa and Meg01 cell culture were low when compared with levels in HepG2 and HuH7 culture medium. PS levels were lowest in medium from HUVEC cell culture.TABLE 2PS protein levels over time in cell cultureCell typePS levels24 h48 h72 h96 hnmnmnmnmHepG20.3150.4980.7521.064HuH70.3430.7091.1661.391HeLa0.1710.1890.2680.405HUVEC0.0420.0720.0890.112Meg010.0650.1260.1490.185 Open table in a new tab PROS1 Promoter Activity in Transient Transfection of Various Cell Types—Transient transfection studies were conducted in unstimulated HepG2, HuH7, HeLa, HUVEC, and Meg01 cells with PROS1 promoter constructs cloned upstream from the firefly luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 1). These studies pointed out that the first 370 bp of the PROS1 5′-flanking region were necessary for maximal promoter activity in all cell lines. When compared with expression in other cell types, the shortest PROS1 construct, PS197-luc, had relatively high activity in HeLa and HuH7 cells. However, background pGL3basic activity was also higher in these cells. Optimal promoter activity was maintained up to a 5′ region with a length of 1062 bp. Constructs longer than 1062 bp had reduced activity in transfections in HepG2 and HeLa cells, whereas in HuH7 and Meg01 cells the promoter activity remained at a high level. This difference in expression indicates that tissue-specific expression of transcription factors that bind to sites in this region may play a role in the regulation of PROS1 activity. Computational analysis of the PROS1 promoter sequence with the MatInspector professional software (39Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar) did not reveal the presence of distinct upstream inhibitory or stimulatory elements, however. Multiple Transcription Factors Bind to the PS Promoter—In a previous study we determined that PROS1 transcription is driven from three possible start sites, namely –100, –114/–117, and –147/–150 (32De Wolf C.J.F. Cupers R.M. Bertina R.M. Vos H.L. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 3: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Here we show that maximal promoter activity is reached with a minimal PROS1 promoter of 370 bp. On basis of these observations we investigated transcription factor binding to the PROS1 region encompassing bp 100 –370 upstream from the translational start. For this purpose, a series of overlapping double-stranded oligonucleotides covering the aforementioned region was designed. The duplexes were all 24 bp long, each having a 12-bp overlap with its neighboring probes. The liver cell line HepG2 was chosen for these more detailed experiments, because it had a high PS expression level and has been more intensely investigated than the HuH7 cell line. Incubation of HepG2 nuclear extracts with radiolabeled oligonucleotide duplexes located between positions –93 and –152 upstream from the PROS1 translational start did not result in the formation of protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 2). In contrast, almost all double-stranded oligonucleotide probes from duplex –152/–129 up to –382/–359 were complexed with nuclear protein. In further experiments we focused on the more pronounced complexes found with primer walking. Upon computational analysis of the first 400 bp of the PROS1 promoter sequence with the MatInspector professional software (39Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar), consensus binding sites for various transcription factors were found (Fig. 3). A high degree (>60%) of interspecies conservation (human, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, dog, bovine, pig, mouse, and rat comparison) was found from ∼250 to ∼100 bp upstream of the PROS1 translational start codon with the VISTA alignment tools (40Mayor C.

Pachter L. Dubchak I. Rubin E.M. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 832-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Binding sites for Sp1 and signal transducer and activator of transcription in this region were found to be conserved by more than 95%. The protein-DNA complexes observed in incubations containing HepG2 nuclear extract and radiolabeled oligonucleotide duplexes –359/–335, –298/–275, –253/–230, and –177/–146 all displayed a similar pattern of retardation on PAGE. Computational analysis pointed out that all oligonucleotides, with the exception of –298/–275, contained putative binding sites for the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1. Sp3, another member of the Sp family of transcription factors, has similar DNA-binding properties as Sp1 and thus often binds to the same sites as Sp1. Four Sp3 isoforms exist with different molecular weights that can all bind to the Sp1 consensus sequence. The result is the highly recognizable Sp1/Sp3 EMSA banding pattern (Fig. 4) (42Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 43Sapetschnig A. Koch F. Rischitor G. Mennenga T. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42095-42105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The specificity of Sp binding to the oligonucleotide duplexes was confirmed in competition experiments with unlabeled wild type oligonucleotide duplexes and the Sp consensus oligonucleotide. Mutant oligonucleotides in which the putative Sp-binding site had been modified did not compete for protein binding. Upon incubation with antibodies directed against either Sp1 or Sp3, a supershift of the specific bands, band a and bands b and c respectively, was observed (Fig. 4, panels A–C). These experiments confirmed our hypothesis that all four oligonucleotide duplexes contained Sp-binding sites. Competition experiments demonstrated that not all Sp-binding sites in the PROS1 promoter bind Sp1 with the same affinity (Fig. 4, panels D and E). By addition of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled competitor in the form of one of the three other duplexes to incubations with either labeled duplex –177/–146 or –298/–275, the following order of binding affinity was established: –177/–146 >–253/–230 >–298/–275 >–359/–335. The oligonucleotide for which the Sp proteins displayed the highest affinity, –177/–146, was 8 bp longer than the other oligonucleotides. The computational analysis showed that more than one Sp-binding site may be located within this region. Moreover, the –177/–146 mutant oligonucleotide was still able to compete slightly for Sp1 binding (Fig. 4, panel A). The higher affinity of Sp1 for –177/–146 may therefore be due to the presence of more than a single Sp-binding site. All other oligonucleotide probe-protein complexes had a unique migratory behavior. Computational data (Fig. 3) and a previous publication (33Tatewaki H. Tsuda H. Kanaji T. Yokoyama K. Hamasaki N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 90: 1029-1039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that the protein complex attached to duplex –282/–258 could be the liver-specific transcription factor FOXA2. This was confirmed by EMSA competition experiments with the wild type oligonucleotide and a mutant oligonucleotide in which the putative FOXA2-binding site had been altered. Moreover, incubation of the wild type oligonucleotide probe with a FOXA2-specific antibody resulted in the disappearance of the FOXA2-specific band (Fig. 5, panel A). Computational analysis also revealed the presence of putative CREB/ATF and NFY sites around positions –346 to –323 and –382 to –359, respectively. Protein-DNA complexes were obtained in incubations with HepG2 nuclear extract and labeled primers at these positions. Evidence for binding of both families of transcription factors was subsequently established in supershift assays with transcription factor"

VEGFs bind to three types of receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGF receptors 1, 2, and 3, that are predominantly expressed on endothelial and some hematopoietic cells.

Distinct conformational differences are observed in loop L1 and particularly in L3, which contains a highly flexible GS-rich motif that differs from all other structural homologs. Based on our structure, we created chimeric proteins by exchanging selected segments in L1 and L3 with the corresponding sequences from PlGF. Single loop mutants did not bind to either receptor, whereas a VEGF-E mutant in which both L1 and L3 were replaced gained affinity for VEGFR-1, illustrating the possibility to engineer receptor-specific chimeric VEGF molecules.

The viral VEGFs are potent mitogens stimulating proliferation of human endothelial cells in vitro and vascularization of sheep skin in vivo with potencies equivalent to VEGF-A (25Wise L.M. Ueda N.

In addition, transgenic mice overexpressing the NZ7 variant of VEGF-E showed increased vascularization in subcutaneous tissue without producing the edematous lesions typically present on the skin of VEGF-A transgenic mice (31Kiba A. Sagara H. Hara T. Shibuya M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).To understand the molecular basis of receptor specificity of VEGF-E, extensive functional studies were carried out in which the residues important for interaction with VEGFR-2 were tentatively established. Kiba et al. (32Kiba A. Yabana N. Shibuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13453-13461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) showed that exchanging the region encompassing loops L1 and L3 of the VEGF-E variant NZ7 by the corresponding loops from PlGF or VEGF-A strongly reduced the activity of this viral VEGF implying specific interactions between L1 and L3 with VEGFR-2 (32Kiba A. Yabana N. Shibuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13453-13461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, despite extensive mutagenesis and molecular modeling, receptor specificity of VEGF-E is not understood at the molecular level, and no chimeric VEGF-E homologs have been described so far that gain the ability to bind VEGFR-1.Here we report the crystal structure of full-length Orf virus VEGF-E NZ2, a representative of the more than 20 VEGF-like molecules expressed by pox viruses. This molecule folds into the same overall structure as VEGF-A, PlGF, VR-1, and Vammin with the characteristic cysteine knot motif. We also present functional data demonstrating that the combined structural epitope formed by loops L1 and L3 dictates receptor specificity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning, Expression, and Purification of VEGF-E—The template DNA was a kind gift from A. A. Mercer (University of Otago, New Zealand). The sequence encoding residues 20-133 of the NZ2 variant Orf virus VEGF-E was amplified by PCR using the following primers: forward primer, 5′-GCTGAATTCGACAGCAACACGAAAGGGATGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GATGATGGTCGACGCGGCGTCTTCTGGGCGG-3′. The PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and SalI, purified, and ligated into the corresponding pPICZαA (Invitrogen) vector for expression in the methylothrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris X-33. The open reading frame encodes a hexahistidine tag at the 3′-end. Cloning and selection of VEGF-E expressing transformants was performed as described earlier (33Scheidegger P. Weiglhofer W. Suarez S. Console S. Waltenberger J. Pepper M.S. Jaussi R. Ballmer-Hofer K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 569-578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 1 liter of buffered glycerol complex medium for 16 h at 30 °C. Upon induction of protein synthesis with 1% methanol, cells produced and secreted VEGF-E for 70 h at 28 °C. Methanol was added every 24 h to a final concentration of 1% (v/v).VEGF-E-containing cell-free medium was centrifuged and filtered. The concentrated supernatant was incubated with endoglycosidase F overnight at 30 °C and subsequently applied to an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (GE Healthcare). The bound protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole, pooled, and chromatographed on a Superdex™ 75 column (GE Healthcare). Native VEGF-E eluted as a homogenous peak that corresponded to a molecular size of 30.3 ± 0.2 kDa as determined by static light scattering (n = 2). The identity of the protein was checked by immunoblotting, by reducing and non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, by amino-terminal sequencing, and by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Construction of VEGF-E NZ2 Mutants—The QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to introduce the sequences encoding loop L1 of PlGF (42EVEHM46), loop L3 of PlGF (82KIRSGDR88), and the point mutation R46I into the vector pPICZαA_VEGF-E_C-His described above. PCR was performed with the following primers: forward primer loop L1, 5′-GTAAGCGAGACGCACCCAGAGGAGGTGGAGCACATGTTCAACCCGCCGTGTGTCAC-3′; reverse primer loop L1, 5′-GTGACACACGGCGGGTTGAACATGTGCTCCACCTCCTCTGGGTGCGTCTCGCTTAC-3′; forward primer loop L3, 5 ′-GTAAACGTGAGCATGGAACTCCTGAAGATCCGTTCTGGGGACCGGAACGGGATGCAACGTCTGAGC-3′; reverse primer loop L3, 5′-GCTCAGACGTTGCATCCCGTTCCGGTCCCCAGAACGGATCTTCAGGAGTTCCATGCTCACGTTTAC-3′; forward primer R46I, 5′-CTGACTTCTCAGATTTTCAACCCGCCGTGTGTC-3′; reverse primer R46I, 5′-GACACACGGCGGGTTGAAAATCTGAGATCAGC-3′. The boldface sequences represent the mutations. To construct the double mutant (loop L1 and loop L3 of PlGF), the plasmid encoding the L1 mutant was used as a template, and PCR was performed as described above with L3 primers. VEGF-E NZ2 mutants with an amino-terminal His6 tag were cloned with Gateway ® technology (Invitrogen). Mutant plasmid DNA was used as a template for PCR with the following primer pair attB1-His6-Tev-VEGF-E forward (5′-GGGGAAAGTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGCTTCCATCACCACACCATCACGAAAACTTATACTTCCAAGACAGCAACACGAAAGGATGG-3′) and attB2-Stop-VEGF-E reverse (3′-GGGGACCATTTGTACAAGAAAGCGGGTCTATCACGGGTCTTCTGGGCG-5′) that introduces the attB recombination sites in the flanking regions and a hexahistidine tag, including a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site at the 5′-end. PCR and in vitro recombination reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). pPICZαA was used as vector for the expression of the VEGF-E mutants in P. pastoris. Proteins were purified as described above.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Soluble VEGFR-2 Domains—A covalently linked dimer of the extracellular part of VEGFR-2 was obtained by carboxyl-terminal fusion of the extracellular domain of VEGFR-2 to the leucine zipper motif of the yeast transcription factor GCN4 containing a disulfide bond-promoting cysteine residue (34Kammerer R.A.

The template DNA for the zipper motif was a gift from M. O. Steinmetz (PSI, Villigen, Switzerland). The sequence encoding the zipper was amplified by PCR, generating a 187-bp fragment containing the linker downstream from the sequence encoding the extracellular seven Ig-like domains of VEGFR-2 and the leucine zipper of GCN4, followed by a sequence encoding a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site, a His6 tag and the sequence downstream of the multiple cloning site in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The primers used were as follows: forward primer, 5′-GTGCCCAGGAAAAGACGAACTTCGGATAACAGTGCGAAGACAAAGTTGAAGAACTGCTGTC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGTGACACTATAGAATAGGGCCCTTAGTATCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCTGGAAGTAGAGGTTCTCACCAACCAGTTTTTTCAGACG-3′. Boldface characters represent the cysteine mutation. In a second PCR, the amplified fragment was inserted by site-specific mutagenesis (36Geiser M. Cebe R. Drewello D. Schmitz R. BioTechniques. 2001; 31 (92): 88-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) into pcDNA3 carrying the sequence encoding the extracellular domain of VEGFR-2.Soluble VEGFR-2 domains were expressed as covalently linked dimers in transiently transfected HEK293T cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 6 mm sodium butyrate and 0.1% fetal bovine serum. After 72 h, the culture supernatant was harvested and loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed, and the His6-tagged protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole. Further purification was achieved by gel filtration on Superdex™ 200 HR (GE Healthcare). The identity of the protein was verified by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, amino-terminal sequencing, and molecular weight determination by static light scattering.Radioiodination—125I labeling of canine recombinant VEGF-A165 and human PlGF-1 was performed as described previously (37Rubio Demirovic A. Canadi J. Weiglhofer W. Scheidegger P. Jaussi R. Ballmer-Hofer K. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 1435-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Canine VEGF-A is one amino acid shorter than the human isoform but functionally identical; we follow the numbering of the human protein (38Scheidegger P. Weiglhofer W. Suarez S. Kaser-Hotz B. Steiner R. Ballmer-Hofer K. Jaussi R. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1449-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the proteins was 60,000 -70,000 cpm/ng.Competition Assays—PAE cells overexpressing VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 were grown overnight to subconfluence in 12-well (for EC50 determination) or 24-well tissue culture plates and incubated for 4 h on ice with 0.1 nm 125I-VEGF-A165 or 125I-PlGF-1 in the presence or absence of various concentrations of cold competitor. Data points were determined in duplicates (for EC50 determination) or in triplicates. Unbound radioactive protein was eliminated by three washes with minimal essential medium, Hepes-buffered saline, 25 mm HEPES, without l-glutamine (Amimed, Allschwil, Switzerland) containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin. Cells were lysed in 1 m NaOH, and radioactivity was determined in a Beckman γ-counter. Data were analyzed with Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.), and EC50 values were determined using nonlinear regression. S.D. values are expressed as a 95% confidence interval of the fitted EC50.Surface Plasmon Resonance—All experiments were performed on a Biacore 3000 apparatus (Biacore Life Sciences) at the Functional Genomics Center of the University of Zürich. Proteins were dissolved in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20) at 20 °C. 1500 response units (RU) of dimeric soluble VEGFR-2 were immobilized on a CM5 chip by amine coupling. As a reference, a blank surface was prepared. The analytes were injected at concentrations ranging from 0.025 to 1.6 nm at a flow of 30 μl/min. Regeneration of the surface was achieved with two 1-min pulses of 4 m MgCl2. Data were evaluated by double referencing using the program BIAevaluation 4.1 (Biacore Life Sciences). kon and koff were simultaneously fitted assuming a 1:1 Langmuir binding mode. For VEGF-EL3, a drifting base line was included in the calculations, which led to a better fit of the data. Without this correction, χ2 was 0.134, kon was 2.96 × 106 m-1 s-1, koff9.3 × 10-4 s-1, and the Kd was 314 pm.Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—Crystals were grown in hanging drops using 40 mg/ml protein solution and 0.6 m ammonium sulfate, 3% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5, and 0.3% benzamidine as precipitant as described. 6A. Wagner, M. Pieren, D. Kostrewa, C. Schulze-Briese, K. Ballmer-Hofer, A. E. Prota, manuscript in preparation. Crystals belong to the space group P4122 (a = b = 98.7 Å, c = 240.2 Å) and contain two VEGF-E dimers in their asymmetric unit. Data were collected at beamline X06SA of the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen, Switzerland) using a MAR165 CCD detector. Data collection and structure determination have been described in detail.6 Buried surface areas were calculated using ArealMol (11Suto K. Yamazaki Y. Morita T. Mizuno H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 2126-2131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) by subtracting the total surface of the interacting molecules from the sum of the surfaces of the individual molecules. All figures representing protein structures were made with PyMol software (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA).RESULTSStructure Determination of VEGF-E—The crystallized protein represents the mature full-length VEGF-E variant NZ2, encompassing residues 20 -133 with a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag. Amino-terminal sequencing of the purified protein confirmed correct proteolytic cleavage by Kex2 in P. pastoris. The protein was functional as judged by its capacity to form covalent homodimers in solution, to bind VEGFR-2 with high affinity, and to induce receptor activation in VEGFR-2-expressing cells (data not shown and supplemental Fig. 2). The structure was determined by x-ray crystallography using the sulfur-SAD method.6 The model was built into electron density maps calculated from experimental phases using Moloc (39Gerber P.R. Muller K. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1995; 9: 251-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) and refined with Refmac 5.2 (40Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13779) Google Scholar). The crystallographic R-factor for the final model and all available data between 50 and 2.3 Å is 22.3%, and the corresponding free R-factor for 5% of the data (2687 reflections) is 24.7%. The model has good geometry with small root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations from ideal values for bond lengths and bond angles. PROCHECK analysis (41Laskowski R.A. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab The asymmetric unit of the VEGF-E crystals contains two homodimers (named AB and CD) that are related by noncrystallographic 2-fold symmetry. The VEGF-E residues in the structure are numbered according to the numbering of VEGF-A. The final model comprises residues A11-A82, A90 -A109, B13-B107, C11-C41, C44 -C82, C91-C110, and D14 -D106. Residues A84 -A89, C42-C43, and C82-C90 are disordered. Furthermore, two N-acetylglucosamines (Asn75B and Asn75D), three benzamidines, three chloride and two sulfate ions, eight glycerol molecules, and two Tris molecules are present. In each monomer, Pro49 is in the cis-configuration. The additional carboxyl-terminal residues originating from the His6 tag are disordered in all monomers.VEGF-E consists of a homodimer that is covalently linked by two intermolecular disulfide bonds between Cys51 and Cys60. The two monomers are related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis perpendicular to the plane of the β sheets. Each monomer contains a central antiparallel β sheet formed by two pairs of twisted antiparallel β strands, named β1, β2, β3, and β4, with the characteristic cysteine knot described also for other related growth factors (11Suto K.

Deficiency of P5N-1 activity in red blood cells results in nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. The enzyme deficiency is either familial or can be acquired through lead poisoning. We present the crystal structure of mouse P5N-1 refined to 2.35Å resolution. The mouse P5N-1 has a 92% sequence identity to its human counterpart. The structure revealed that P5N-1 adopts a fold similar to enzymes of the haloacid dehydrogenase superfamily. The active site of this enzyme is structurally highly similar to those of phosphoserine phosphatases. We propose a catalytic mechanism for P5N-1 that is also similar to that of phosphoserine phosphatases and provide experimental evidence for the mechanism in the form of structures of several reaction cycle states, including: 1) P5N-1 with bound Mg(II) at 2.25Å, 2) phosphoenzyme intermediate analog at 2.30Å, 3) product-transition complex analog at 2.35Å, and 4) product complex at 2.1Å resolution with phosphate bound in the active site. Furthermore the structure of Pb(II)-inhibited P5N-1 (at 2.35Å) revealed that Pb(II) binds within the active site in a way that compromises function of the cationic cavity, which is required for the recognition and binding of the phosphate group of nucleotides.

Here we report the x-ray structure of mouse P5N-1 (mP5N-1, UniProt code Q9D020) refined to 2.35 Å resolution and structures of several states of the mP5N-1 reaction cycle at 2.1-2.35 Å resolution that corroborate the hypothesis that the mP5N-1 catalytic mechanism is closely analogous to that of phosphoserine phosphatases. Furthermore we present a 2.35 Å structure of mP5N-1 complexed with Pb(II) and propose a mechanism for mP5N-1 inhibition by this metal. The structure of mP5N-1 represents a fold-space target (<30% sequence identity to any structure in the Protein Data Bank) and was determined under the NIGMS, National Institutes of Health Protein Structure Initiative.

The diffraction images were integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (25.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Macromol. Crystallogr. A. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The selenium substructure of SeMet-labeled mP5N-1 crystals was determined using HYSS (26.Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The structure was completed using alternate cycles of manual building in XFIT (31.McRee D.E. J. Struct.

All refinement steps were monitored using an Rfree value based on ≈5.1% of the independent reflections. The stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed using PROCHECK (33.Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and MOLPROBITY (34.Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall III, W.B. de Bakker P.I. Word J.M.

X-ray diffraction data for the product complex (state VII) were collected at Northeastern Collaborative Access Team 8BM beamline of Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory and processed using HKL2000. Data for the remaining complexes were collected with a Bruker AXS Proteum R CCD detector and Microstar rotating anode generator using copper Kα radiation. All x-ray data were processed and scaled with the programs SAINT and SADABS from the Proteum software suite (Bruker, Madison, WI). Structures of mP5N-1 complexes were solved by molecular replacement or rigid body refinement using apo-mP5N-1 as a model, manually adjusted with COOT (35.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar), and refined as described for apo-mP5N-1. The figures were prepared using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA). Structure of mP5N-1—The structure of the mP5N-1 apoenzyme was determined by single wavelength anomalous diffraction and refined to a resolution of 2.35 Å. Data collection, refinement, and model statistics are summarized in Table 2. The three-dimensional structure of mP5N-1 revealed that this protein belongs to the α/β-class of proteins with a three-layer sandwich architecture and Rossmann fold topology in the core domain (Fig. 1, cyan and red). Extended loops of the fold that span residues 55-142 and 190-211 form an auxiliary domain (Fig. 1, yellow and green). Two of the helices of the auxiliary domain (α4 and α5 in Fig. 1) form an extended “lid” located over the core domain. Two molecules of mP5N-1 present in the asymmetric unit showed only minimal differences in their main-chain conformation and were therefore refined using tight non-crystallographic symmetry restraints.TABLE 2Crystal parameters, X-ray data collection, and refinement statisticsApo-PN1 (state I)Mg(II) complex (state II)BeF3− (state V)Product transition (state VI)Product complex (state VII)Pb(II) complexSpace groupP32P32P32P32P32P32Unit cell parameters (Å)a = 133.7a = 134.3a = 134.8a = 135.0a = 134.0a = 134.5c = 38.9c = 39.2c = 38.9c = 39.0c = 39.1c = 39.2Data collection statisticsWavelength (Å)0.979111.541.541.540.979111.54Resolution range (Å)50-2.35 (2.40-2.35)inf-2.25 (2.35-2.25)inf-2.30 (2.35-2.30)inf-2.35 (2.45-2.35)50-2.1 (2.15-2.1)inf-2.35 (2.45-2.35)No. of reflections (measured/unique)aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.173,824/31,917668,922/37,523270,892/33,047553,888/33,163174,028/45,396801,143/33,118Completeness (%)98.5 (87.5)100.0 (100.0)93.9 (84.0)100 (99.9)98.9 (97.6)100.0 (100.0)RmergebRmerge = ∑h∑i|Ii(h) - 〈I(h) 〉|/∑h∑iIi(h) where Ii(h) is the intensity of an individual measurement of the reflection and <I(h)> is the mean intensity of the reflection.0.091 (0367)0.100 (0.619)0.128 (0.636)0.099 (0.670)0.071 (0.317)0.096 (0.515)Redundancy5.4 (3.3)17.8 (7.2)7.7 (4.3)16.7 (6.4)3.8 (3.2)24.2 (7.4)Mean I/σ(I)14.2 (2.4)20.6 (3.0)11.3 (2.2)19.1 (2.2)17.3 (3.0)26.0 (3.8)Refinement and model statisticsResolution range43.76-2.3567.17-2.2567.42-2.3067.52-2.3532.19-2.1067.27-2.35No. of reflections (work/test)30,291/1,61935,606/1,89931,354/1,67331,358/1,67343,135/2,25731,430/1,668RcrystcRcryst = ∑h||Fobs| - |Fcalc||/∑h|Fobs| where Fobs and Fcalc are the observed and calculated structure-factor amplitudes, respectively.0.163 (0.213)0.155 (0.219)0.184 (0.238)0.190 (0.273)0.150 (0.195)0.149 (0.187)RfreedRfree was calculated as Rcryst using ~5.0% of the randomly selected unique reflections that were omitted from structure refinement.0.220 (0.245)0.219 (0.314)0.258 (0.310)0.261 (0.360)0.198 (0.278)0.230 (0.275)r.m.s.d. bonds (Å)0.0190.0170.0180.0150.0150.017r.m.s.d. angles (°)1.5481.4701.6641.4101.3161.507ESU from Rfree (Å)eDispersion precision indicator based on Rfree (57).0.2160.2000.2520.2530.1520.231B factorWilson plot (Å)49.234.238.04736.140.0Protein/solvent/ligands (Å)47.7/52.2/33.533.1/45.9/45.438.0/42.7/31.443.1/45.7/35.935.9/49.2/23.136.0/46.9/40.1No. of protein molecules/atoms2/4,6602/4,6652/4,6602/4,6522/4,6602/4,652No. of waters359815538479848862No. of ions2 Mg2+2 Mg2+2 Mg2+2 Mg2+2 Pb2+No. of auxiliary molecules2 HEPES2 PIPES2 PIPES, 2 AlF32 PIPES, 2 PO42−2 HEPESRamachandran plot (%)Most favorable region92.091.691.090.692.092.0Additional allowed region8.08.48.69.08.08.0Generously allowed region0.00.00.40.40.00.0PBD code2bdu2g062g072g082g092g0aa Values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.b Rmerge = ∑h∑i|Ii(h) - 〈I(h) 〉|/∑h∑iIi(h) where Ii(h) is the intensity of an individual measurement of the reflection and <I(h)> is the mean intensity of the reflection.c Rcryst = ∑h||Fobs| - |Fcalc||/∑h|Fobs| where Fobs and Fcalc are the observed and calculated structure-factor amplitudes, respectively.d Rfree was calculated as Rcryst using ~5.0% of the randomly selected unique reflections that were omitted from structure refinement.e Dispersion precision indicator based on Rfree (57.Cruickshank D.W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W284-W288Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), and SUPERFAMILY (38.Gough J. Karplus K. Hughey R. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 903-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), revealed that mP5N-1 is likely a member of the haloacid dehydrogenase (HAD) superfamily (SUPERFAMILY E = 4.7 × 10−13). The HAD superfamily includes a range of phosphomutases, phosphatases, nucleotidases, and dehalogenases (39.Aravind L. Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 127-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). HAD superfamily enzymes contain the signature motif DXDX(T/V). Aspartates within this motif have been implicated in the catalytic mechanism of several members of the HAD superfamily (40.Collet J.F. Stroobant V. Pirard M. Delpierre G. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14107-14112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 41.Wang W. Cho H.S. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Nguyen H.H. Grigoriev I.V. Wemmer D.E. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A set of highly conserved residues of structurally characterized members of the HAD superfamily, as detected by profile-profile multiple sequence alignment by FFAS03, is also conserved in mP5N-1 and includes residues Asp49, Asp51, Thr53, Lys213, Gly237, Asp238, and Asp242. All these residues are involved in the formation of the active sites in HAD superfamily enzymes (39.Aravind L. Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 127-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). mP5N-1 residues Asp49, Asp51, and Thr53 reside within the signature motif DXDX(T/V). All conserved residues cluster in the mP5N-1 structure in the area that likely represents the active site (Fig. 1, blue sticks). Structural Homology Search—To confirm that mP5N-1 belongs to the HAD superfamily we performed a structural homology search using the DALI and VAST servers (42.Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar, 43.Madej T. Gibrat J.F. Bryant S.H. Proteins. 1995; 23: 356-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Both DALI and VAST identified a range of structural homologs of mP5N-1, many of which were indeed established members of the HAD superfamily. The closest structural homologs of mP5N-1 identified by both servers were phosphoserine phosphatases (PSPs) from different species. Specifically the top homolog found by DALI was a PSP from Methanococcus jannaschii (MjPSP) with Z = 14.7, root mean square deviation of 3.5 Å, and 17% sequence identity over 201 aligned Cα residues (Protein Data Bank code 1f5s (44.Wang W. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar)). The top structural homolog identified by VAST was human PSP (hPSP) with a VAST score of 20.9, root mean square deviation of 3.4 Å, and 17.5% sequence identity over 206 aligned residues (Protein Data Bank code 1l8o (45.Kim H.Y. Heo Y.S. Kim J.H. Park M.H. Moon J. Kim E. Kwon D. Yoon J. Shin D. Jeong E.J. Park S.Y. Lee T.G. Jeon Y.H. Ro S. Cho J.M. Hwang K.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46651-46658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)). Fig. 2A shows a structural superposition of mP5N-1 and hPSP as determined by DALI. Although the overall fold of these proteins is clearly similar there are several notable differences. 1) mP5N-1 has a longer amino terminus (22 more residues). 2) Helices α4 and α5 in the lid domain are longer in mP5N-1 (residues 97-105). 3) Loops of mP5N-1 usually contain insertions of several residues and show significant differences in their local conformation from hPSP. Structural comparison of the active sites of PSPs and mP5N-1 revealed that they are highly similar (Fig. 2B). Mechanism Overview—The catalytic mechanism of MjPSP and hPSP has been studied in considerable structural detail by x-ray crystallography (41.Wang W. Cho H.S. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Nguyen H.H.

Both hP5N-1 and PSPs catalyze dephosphorylation of their substrates: pyrimidine 5′-mononucleotides and phosphoserine, respectively. The overall reaction catalyzed by P5N-1 is shown in Fig. 3A. Because the active site of mP5N-1 is nearly identical to that of PSPs, we hypothesized that the catalytic mechanism of mP5N-1 might be analogous to that of PSPs. To provide experimental evidence for this hypothesis we set out to structurally characterize accessible states of the mP5N-1 reaction cycle. The general scheme of the proposed reaction cycle of mP5N-1, based on that of MjPSP (41.Wang W. Cho H.S. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Nguyen H.H. Grigoriev I.V. Wemmer D.E. Kim S.H. J. Mol.

Table 1 summarizes attempts made to prepare crystals of mP5N-1 trapped in different states of the reaction cycle. In summary, we successfully characterized the following: 1) apo-mP5N-1 (state I, reported above), 2) mP5N-1 with bound Mg(II) (state II), 3) the phosphoenzyme intermediate analog with BeF−3 mimicking the phosphate group (state V), 4) the product-transition state analog with AlF3 mimicking the phosphate (state VI), and 5) the product complex with Mg(II) and phosphate bound in the active site (state VII). However, we were unable to trap the nucleotide-bound states III and IV. When UMP or CMP was included during the soak procedure we ended up with the phosphate product complex (state VII) (Table 1, lines 2 and 3). This observation suggests that mP5N-1 is catalytically active within the crystal lattice. Similarly inclusion of uridine and AlF3 in the experiment designed to trap the substrate-transition analog complex (Table 1, lines 6 and 7; state IV) was unsuccessful even when 100 mm uridine was used and instead resulted only in the analog of the product-transition complex (state VI). Table 2 provides details of data collection and structure refinement for states II, V, VI, and VII of the mP5N-1 reaction mechanism. Snapshots of the catalytic site in structurally characterized states are shown in Fig. 4, A-E.FIGURE 4Structural snapshots of the mP5N-1 reaction cycle.

The basic genome organization of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) 2The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; ORF, open reading frame; RRE, Rev response element; hnRNP, heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; ORF, open reading frame; RRE, Rev response element; hnRNP, heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. provirus is similar to all other retroviruses with respect to the three major open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the structural proteins (Gag), the protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase enzymes (Pol), and the envelope glycoproteins (Env) (Fig. 1A). Gag and Pol are produced from the unspliced transcript, whereas Env is produced from an mRNA in which an intron, defined by a major 5′-splice site (SD1) in the 5′-untranslated region and one of several 3′-splice sites (SA3-SA5) at the end of the pol ORF, is spliced out. HIV-1 contains 6 additional genes termed tat, rev, vif, vpr, vpx, and nef that are produced from alternative splicing. In total, five 5′-splice sites and 11 3′-splice sites have been identified, which give rise to more than 40 different mRNAs grouped into three different classes: the unspliced primary transcript (∼9 kb), a class of singly spliced RNAs (∼4 kb), and a class of two or multiple spliced RNAs (∼2 kb) (1Purcell D.F.

In the early phase of HIV-1 infection, only completely spliced mRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm, encoding the Tat, Rev, and Nef proteins. Subsequently Rev binds to its target sequence on incompletely spliced HIV-1 RNAs, termed Rev response element (RRE), and mediates their nuclear export (7Malim M.H. Hauber J. Le S.Y. Maizel J.V. Cullen B.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 8Daly T.J. Cook K.S. Gray G.S. Maione T.E. Rusche J.R. Nature. 1989; 342: 816-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The accumulation of unspliced and partially spliced RNAs in the cytoplasm requires that the removal of introns from the primary HIV-1 transcript is inefficient and delayed. Thus, a hallmark of the HIV-1 genome is the presence of optimal 5′-splice sites that match the consensus sequence and non-consensus 3′-splice sites with short polypyrimidine tracts interrupted by purines and non-canonical branch point sequences. The recognition and modulation of these splice signals is controlled by intronic and exonic splice enhancers and silencers situated in the vicinity of the splice sites. The splice enhancers are recognized by members of the SR protein family (9Ropers D. Ayadi L. Gattoni R. Jacquenet S. Damier L. Branlant C. Stevenin J. J. Biol.

Moreover, the removal of HIV-1 introns has been suggested to be sequential, proceeding from the 5′-end, because splicing of introns in the 3′-untranslated region can be detrimental due to the induction of nonsense-mediated decay. Bohne et al. (19Bohne J. Wodrich H. Krausslich H.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 825-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have shown that splicing of a 3′-intron in HIV-1 is tightly inhibited unless the 5′-introns are removed. Accordingly, mutating the major splice donor site (SD1) blocks all downstream splice events. Another intriguing feature is the connection between splice sites, RNA stability, and nuclear export. The SD4 5′-splice site in HIV-1 has been shown to exert a stabilizing effect on the steady-state level of HIV-1 RNA and modulates Rev-mediated nuclear export and stability (20Lu X.B. Heimer J.

Lund M.K. Kjems J. Scheid A. Schaal H. RNA. 2001; 7: 421-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In these studies it was shown that insufficient hydrogen bonding between the splice donor SD4 and the 5′-end of U1 snRNA leads to (nuclear) degradation of HIV-1 RNA. Thus, the 5′-splice sites provide an RNA protective function in addition to their role in pre-mRNA splicing. In this study we have identified two novel HIV-1 mRNA species by cloning cDNAs amplified with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Both mRNAs contain a new 178-nt-long exon, positioned in the gag-pol gene, and the flanking 5′- and 3′-splice sites are well conserved among different HIV-1 subtypes. Splicing of this exon is tightly repressed during the course of an HIV-1 infection, suggesting another role for this exon. In this report we provide evidence that the highly conserved and intrinsically strong 5′-splice site may serve an important function in protecting and stabilizing the unspliced HIV-1 mRNA. Plasmids and Protein Expression—Plasmids pUC18 HIV-E1a-E2 and pUC18 HIV-E1-E2 were generated by PCR, using pHIV-1 LAI derived from HIV-1 isolate LAI as a template and primers 476U45 (5′-GCG GAT CCT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG GTC TCT CTG GTT AGA CCA-3′), 4602U45 (5′-GCG GAT CCT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG GAA GAT GGC CAG TAA AAA-3′), and 5027L28 (5′-TGC GTC GAC CTT TCC AGA GGA GCT TTG C-3′). The resulting EcoRI-SalI-cleaved PCR products were inserted between the EcoRI and SalI sites of pUC18 vector (22Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11449) Google Scholar). The plasmid pUC18 HIV-E1-E2(ΔClaI/BsrGI) was constructed by deleting 3627 bp of the first HIV-1 intron between the ClaI and BsrGI sites in pUC18 HIV-E1-E2, followed by a fill-in using Klenow polymerase and blunt end ligation. Plasmid pCMVΔR8.2 3U was generated by PCR from plasmid pCMVΔR8.2 (23Naldini L. Blomer U. Gage F.H. Trono D. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

RT-PCR—Reverse transcription (RT) PCR was performed on total RNA purified from SupT1 cell cultures with moderate to complete syncytia formation after 48-72 h of infection with HIV-1 (subtype LAI). For first strand synthesis up to 2 μg of total RNA were mixed with 2 pmol primer, denatured at 70 °C for 5 min, and chilled on ice. The mixture was then incubated for 60 min at 42 °C in the presence of 1× AMV reverse transcriptase reaction buffer, 4 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm each dNTP, 40 units of RNasin RNase inhibitor (Promega), and 30 units of AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega). Seven amplification primers were used in this work. Primer 5895L32 binds to exon 4 (antisense strand) and was used for first strand synthesis. Primer 768U28 (sense strand) spans the major 5′-splice site and splice acceptor SA1A. Primer 4991L25 (antisense strand) spans SA1 and SD1A. Primers 733U26 and 760U31 (sense strand) bind to the first HIV-1 exon upstream of SD1 and were used as nested primers. Primer 5039L25 is located in exon 2 (antisense strand) and used in combination with primer 4812L28 (antisense strand) binding to exon 1A for nested PCR. The sequences of the primers are as follows: 768U28, 5′-GCG GAT CCG AGG GGA GGC GAC TGC AGG A-3′; 4991L25, 5′-GCG GAT CCT CTC TGC TGT CCC TGG C-3′; 5039L25, 5′-GCG GAT CCT TTG CTG GTC CTT TCC A-3′; 4812L28, 5′-GCG GAT CCC TGG CCT ATA ATT TTC TTT A-3′; 733U26, 5′-GAG AAT TCG GAC TCG GCT TGC TGA AG-3′; 5895L32, 5′-GCG GAT CCG CCT ATT CTG CTA TGT CGA CAC CC-3′; 760U31, 5′-GAG AAT TCC AAG AGG CGA GGG GAG GCG ACT G-3′. Cell Culture and Transfection—293T cells were propagated and transfected for Northern blot analysis using Lipofectamine™ reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer's protocol with minor modifications. For each transfection, 35 μl of Lipofectamine™ reagent and 20 μg of DNA were mixed with 500 μl of RPMI medium without serum (Invitrogen). The amount of DNA in all cotransfection experiments was kept constant by adding plasmid pGL3 (Promega). Transfection efficiency was monitored by including pDS-Red1-N1 (Clontech). The diluted DNA and diluted Lipofectamine™ reagent were combined and incubated at room temperature for 20 min to allow DNA-liposome complexes to form. The mixture was then added to 293T cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum on a 10-cm plate to 50-60% confluency. Total RNA was isolated 24 h after transfection using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA isolated 24 h after transfection was subjected to electrophoresis on a denaturing 1% agarose gel containing 5% formaldehyde. The RNA (15 μg in each lane) was transferred onto positively charged nylon membrane (Hybond N+; Amersham Biosciences). After immobilizing the RNA by UV cross-linking (0.5 J/cm2; Stratalinker), the membrane was hybridized at 42 °C in ULTRAhyb solution (Ambion). HIV-1-derived RNA was detected with a 32P-labeled probe synthesized from the 463-bp EcoRI/SalI fragment of pUC18 HIV-E1a-E2. To monitor transfection efficiency, the membrane was hybridized with a probe specific for green fluorescent protein (GFP), which was synthesized from the 246-bp StuI/NotI fragment of pDS-Red1-N1. The membranes were autoradiographed and quantified using Bio-Rad phosphorimaging and ImageQuant software. S1 Nuclease Analysis—50 nmol radiolabeled oligonucleotide 4974L60A (5′-GCT TTG CTG GTC CTT TCC AAA GTG GAT CTC TGC TGT CCC TGT AAT AAA CCG CTT TTA AAA-3′), 4974L60B (5′-GCT TTG CTG GTC CTT TCC AAA GTG GAT CTC TGC TGT CCC TGG CCT ATA ATA AAG AAA TTA-3′), 4974L60C (5′-GCT TTG CTG GTC CTT TCC AAA GTG GAT CTC TGC TGT CCC AGT CGC CTC CCG AGC GGA GAA-3′), and 5838L60 (5′-GTT GAG TAA CGC CTA TTC TGC TAT GTC GAC ACC CAA TTC TGG CCT ATA ATA AAG AAA TTA-3′) were mixed with 15 μg of total RNA. After ethanol precipitation, the pellet was dissolved in 80% FA-PIPES buffer (80% formamide, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), denatured for 10 min at 65 °C, and subsequently hybridized at 30 °C overnight. Then, 300 μl of S1 nuclease buffer (30 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 0.45 mm ZnSO4, 20 μg/ml of single-stranded DNA, 300 units/ml of S1 nuclease) were added to each reaction. After 60 min of incubation at 30 °C, reactions were stopped by adding 80 μl of stop buffer (4 m ammonium acetate, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 40 μg/ml of tRNA). After ethanol precipitation, the DNA was separated on a denaturing 16% (19:1) polyacrylamide gel containing 1× TBE and 8 m urea. T7 Transcription—Radiolabeled pre-mRNAs were generated by in vitro run-off transcription in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), 1 mm CAP analog (m7G(5′)-ppp(5′)G; Amersham Biosciences), 500 μm ATP, 500 μm CTP, 50 μm GTP, and 50 μm UTP. All HIV-1 pre-mRNAs were transcribed with T7 polymerase from PCR-amplified products of plasmids pUC18 HIV-E1-E2(ΔCla/BsrGI) and pUC18 HIV-E1a-E2 using the 5′-primers 476U45 and 4602U45 and the 3′-primers 5027L28 and 4812L28. After 2-4 h of incubation, transcripts were gel purified, precipitated, and redissolved in water. In Vitro Splicing—In vitro splicing reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 μl containing 40% HeLa nuclear extract (4C), 2.6% (w/v) polyvinylalcohol, 12% glycerol, 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 0.5 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, and 2.5 mm MgCl2. Splicing reactions containing 25 fmol transcript were incubated at 30 °C for 3 h and stopped by treatment with 40 μg of proteinase K in the presence of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 12.5 mm EDTA, 1 μg of yeast tRNA, and 1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C. After precipitation with 40 μl of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 1 ml of 99.5% ethanol, the samples were resuspended in RNA loading buffer (90% (v/v) formamide, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.05% (w/v) xylene cyanol). After heating to 95 °C for 3 min, the RNA was separated on a denaturing 6% (19:1) polyacrylamide gel containing 0.75× TBE and 8 m urea. All HIV-1-derived RNAs were spliced under the same conditions. The gels were autoradiographed and quantified using Bio-Rad phosphorimaging and ImageQuant software. In a search for new splice signals within the HIV-1 genome, we identified a putative splice donor site with the sequence AG/GUAAGA at nucleotide position 4721 (numbering according to HXB2). It closely matches the optimal 5′-splice site consensus sequence AG/GURAGY (where R is A or G, and Y is C or U) except for the last nucleotide and is situated in the pol gene, 190 nucleotides upstream of the previously characterized splice acceptor site SA1 (Fig. 1). To test whether this 5′-splice site is used in vivo, RT-PCR analysis with a primer positioned in the first HIV-1 exon and a primer spanning the putative splice donor site and splice acceptor site SA1 was performed on total RNA isolated from HIV-1-infected cells. We obtained a PCR product of 230 bp, which was subsequently cloned and sequenced. It revealed that the major 5′-splice site (SD1) was joined to a novel splice acceptor site with the sequence AAUUAG/CA at nucleotide position 4543. This implies that the PCR product was derived from an mRNA containing HIV-1 exon 1, a novel exon of 178 nucleotides in length, and exon 2. The new splice acceptor site contains a short polypyrimidine tract of only 9 consecutive pyrimidines characteristic for all splice acceptor sites in HIV-1 (Fig. 1B). The novel splice donor and acceptor sites were denoted SD1A and SA1A, respectively, and the new exon named exon 1A (Fig. 1B). To address the question whether exon 1A is joined to exons other than exon 2, we performed RT-PCR using a primer in exon 1A and primers positioned in exon 3 or 4. A PCR product of 200 bp was obtained using the exon 4 primer, which was subsequently cloned and sequenced. The fragment derived from an mRNA containing exon 1A and exon 4. PCR products containing exon 1A and exon 4 in combination with exon 2 and/or exon 3 were not detected (data not shown). To investigate whether the newly identified splice donor and acceptor sites are conserved in different HIV-1 isolates, we compared a representative set of 367 HIV-1 sequences retrieved from the HIV data base (hiv-web.lanl.gov) both on the protein and nucleotide levels (Fig. 2, A and B). Because splice acceptor SA1A and splice donor SD1A are located within the pol open reading frame, we analyzed the frequency of codons overlapping with both splice sites. As shown in Fig. 2C 82% of the leucine residues at position 886 are encoded by a UUA codon. In contrast, the average fraction of UUA codons in HIV-1 and human ORFs is only 26 and 8%, respectively. Similar values can be found for the other codons overlapping with the exon 1A 5′- and 3′-splice sites (Fig. 2C). Thus, the strong bias for codons that are otherwise infrequently used in HIV-1 and human indicates that these splice sites are phylogenetically conserved at the RNA level and that their integrity might be important for the viability of the virus. To quantify the inclusion of exon 1A into HIV-1 mRNA, we performed an S1 nuclease-mapping analysis using RNA isolated from SupT1 cells infected with wild-type HIV-1 for 0-3 days (Fig. 3). To detect splicing of exon 1A, we designed four 60-nucleotide-long single-stranded DNA probes spanning either the splice acceptor SA1 (Fig. 3A, Oligo 4974L60A), splice donor SD1A joint to splice acceptor SA1 (Fig. 3A, Oligo 4974L60B), splice donor SD1 joint to splice acceptor SA1 (Fig. 3A, Oligo 4974L60C), or splice donor SD1A joint to splice acceptor SA3 (Fig. 3A, Oligo 5838L60). S1 mapping using oligonucleotide 4974L60A (Fig. 3B, lanes 1-4) resulted in protected bands of 50 (unspliced) and 38 nucleotides in length (SD1 spliced either to SD1A or SA1). Oligonucleotide 4974L60B results only in 41- and 39-nucleotide bands (corresponding to unspliced and exon 1 to exon 2 spliced RNA, respectively, suggesting that no or very little product is formed between exon 1A and exon 2 (Fig. 3B, lanes 5-8). In contrast to the RT-PCR experiment above, splicing of exon 1A to exon 4 could not be detected by S1 mapping using oligonucleotide 5838L60 (Fig. 3C, lanes 14-17). This is based on the observation that only a 41-nucleotide band, corresponding to unspliced RNA, was observed. As shown in Fig. 3C, lanes 10-13, increasing amounts of both unspliced (39-nucleotide band) and RNA that has been spliced from SD1 to SA1 (50-nucleotide band) are detectable in SupT1 cells from the first day of infection and increase at about the same rate. Collectively our data suggest that splice donor SD1A is only infrequently used in vivo. Previous investigations have shown that processing of HIV-1 RNA is highly regulated by splicing factors such as members of the SR (serine/arginine) protein and hnRNP family that bind to splice enhancer and silencer elements surrounding the splice sites (10Zahler A.M.

To study whether any of these splicing factors has an effect on exon 1A inclusion in vitro, we created a set of mini-gene constructs shown in Fig. 4A. To test splicing between SD1 and SA1A, we constructed a splicing substrate containing only HIV-1 exons 1 and 1A. To enable in vitro splicing analysis the region from nucleotide 832 to 4422 (numbering according to HXB2) was deleted to reduce the intron size to 208 nt (Fig. 4A). The remaining intron is composed of an 88-nucleotide region downstream of the major 5′-splice site (SD1) and a 120-nucleotide region upstream of SA1A. RNA transcribed from this construct was added as a substrate to in vitro splicing reactions using HeLa nuclear extract supplemented with either recombinant ASF/SF2 or hnRNP A1 protein. As shown in Fig. 4B, removal of the intron is highly inefficient (Fig. 4B, lane 1) and only detectable when ASF/SF2 was added to the reactions (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, splicing of SD1A to SA1 is readily detectable in HeLa nuclear extract without the addition of ASF/SF2 (Fig. 4D, lane 1) and is stimulated when supplemented with ASF/SF2 (Fig. 4D, lanes 2 and 3). Addition of hnRNP A1 had the opposite effect and repressed splicing (Fig. 4D, lanes 4 and 5). This indicates the presence of splicing enhancer and silencer elements within this construct that act as binding sites for ASF/SF2 and hnRNP A1. The presence of a splicing enhancer within the second HIV-1 exon was further supported by the observation that its replacement with the second exon of PIP7.A pre-mRNA abolished the stimulatory effect of ASF/SF2 on splicing to SD1A (data not shown). A third construct, containing all three exons, was used to investigate whether any of the two splicing factors is able to induce exon 1A inclusion. A splicing analysis using this construct yielded only spliced products containing exons 1 and 2, and addition of ASF/SF2 or hnRNP A1 did not affect splicing of this substrate significantly (Fig. 4C). We conclude that the effect observed on SD1A to SA1 splicing is not observed in the 3-exon construct, possibly because splicing between SD1 and SA1 is dominating. Alternatively, the deletion made in the intron between SD1 and SA1A may contain sequences that contribute to the proper recognition of the splice acceptor SA1A. In light of the low splicing activity of the new exon we found it intriguing that its splice sites are so well conserved in different HIV-1 isolates. This prompted us to investigate another potential role of exon 1A in more detail. Recently, it was demonstrated that the integrity of 5′-splice sites can be an important determinant of mRNA stability (20Lu X.B. Heimer J. Rekosh D. Hammarskjold M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7598-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 21Kammler S. Leurs C. Freund M. Krummheuer J. Seidel K. Tange T.O. Lund M.K. Kjems J. Scheid A. Schaal H. RNA. 2001; 7: 421-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether a point mutation in SD1A affects the stability of HIV-1 RNA correspondingly. For this purpose, we changed the sequence of the splice donor site SD1A from AG/GUAAGA to AG/GUUAGA by site-directed mutagenesis. A similar point mutation, denoted 3U, reduced the HIV-1 RNA to non-detectable levels when it was introduced into SD4 (21Kammler S. Leurs C. Freund M. Krummheuer J. Seidel K. Tange T.O. Lund M.K. Kjems J. Scheid A. Schaal H. RNA. 2001; 7: 421-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Total RNA isolated from 293T cells transfected with a construct expressing the wild-type and mutant splice donor site SD1A was subjected to Northern analysis in order to compare the steady-state levels of HIV-1 RNA. As is shown in Fig. 5A, lane 3, the 3U mutation reduced the level of HIV-1 RNA significantly to only 19% of the wild-type level (Fig. 5B). It is important to note that all transfections were of comparable efficiency (Fig. 5A, lanes 1-7, lower panel, GFP). To confirm this result, we performed S1 nuclease analysis on the RNA using the same oligonucleotides as for the quantification of exon 1A splicing in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 5C, both oligonucleotides detected similar levels of unspliced HIV-1 RNA in cells transfected with the wild-type construct (lanes 3 and 6), and the amount of transcript detectable for the 3U mutant was profoundly reduced (lanes 2 and 5). Although the steady-state level of HIV-1 RNA was greatly reduced by the 3U mutation, spliced mRNA containing exon 1 to exon 2 was still detectable as a 39-nucleotide protected band (Fig. 5C, lane 5), indicating that splicing was not affected by the U3 mutation. To show that U1 snRNA binding is important for RNA expression, a construct expressing the U1 snRNA with a Gly to Ala mutation at position 6, U1-6A snRNA, was cotransfected into the cells. This snRNA contains a compensatory base change (ACUAAC\CUG) that restores the number of hydrogen bonds between the mutated 5′-splice site and the 5′-end of U1 snRNA. Coexpression of U1-6A snRNA with the 3U mutant restored HIV-1 RNA expression almost to the wild-type level (Fig. 5A, lane 5), indicating that it is the interaction between the U1 snRNA and the 5′-splice site that is important for RNA stability. It is important to note that the level of wild-type HIV-1 RNA remained unchanged when the U1-6A snRNA was cotransfected (Fig. 5A, lane 7), showing that the suppression of the 3U mutation was specific. Collectively, these data suggest that the new splice donor site SD1A characterized in this report has a function in stabilizing HIV-1 RNA. While evaluating the HIV-1 genome for new splice signals, we discovered a novel exon located in the gag-pol gene. To the best of our knowledge, this exon has never been observed before in any of the mRNA species generated by the provirus despite being intensely studied (1Purcell D.F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6365-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Schwartz S. Felber B.K. Benko D.M. Fenyo E.M. Pavlakis G.N. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2519-2529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Furtado M.R.

The relatively infrequent use of the exon, at least in cultured HIV-1-infected cells, may explain this. Splicing of exon 1A is affected by both the SR protein ASF/SF2 and hnRNP A1, which are known to act antagonistically on different HIV-1 splice sites (9Ropers D. Ayadi L. Gattoni R. Jacquenet S.

The most pronounced effect is observed for splicing of SD1A to exon 2. The activation of splicing by ASF/SF2 is probably related to a splicing enhancer element consisting of a GGAAAGG repeat that has been recently identified in HIV-1 exon 2. 3H. Schaal, personal communication. However, ASF/SF2 was not sufficient to induce inclusion of exon 1A in vitro using a 3-exon construct, which could be related to the inefficient use of splice acceptor site SA1A (Fig. 4B). This raises the possibility that SD1A in some transcripts might be used as an alternative 5′-splice site instead of the major splice donor SD1. This would result in an mRNA with exon 1 extended from 288 to 4302 nucleotides, encoding only 891 amino acids of the pol ORF and a C terminus of varying length (depending which downstream acceptor site is used). However, such an mRNA species was not detected in our RT-PCR analysis. The mRNA produced from splicing exon 1A in combination with exon 1 and either exon 2 or 4 contains three potential start codons within exon 1A (Fig. 1B, ATG, underlined), but none of them is positioned in a reading frame that can be translated to a protein of significant length, either alone or in combination with one of the downstream exons. Therefore, exon 1A probably does not give rise to new proteins. In HIV-1, several cryptic splice sites have been identified that become active when the authentic splice sites are mutated or deleted or parts of the HIV-1 genome are placed into constructs of heterologous context (1Purcell D.F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6365-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been postulated that these cryptic splice sites are part of a viral evolution strategy leading to the synthesis of novel chimeric proteins (27Benko D.M. Schwartz S. Pavlakis G.N. Felber B.K. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2505-2518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Salfeld J. Gottlinger H.G. Sia R.A. Park R.E. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 965-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For instance, mutations in the HIV-1 genome that normally would be considered lethal to the virus can be suppressed by alternative splicing events that replace faulty sequence elements (29Verhoef K. Bilodeau P.S. van Wamel J.L. Kjems J. Stoltzfus C.M. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3495-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Such a genomic plasticity may be important for viral evolution but can hardly account for conservation of splice sites flanking exon 1A. Our results strongly suggest that the SD1A also fulfills a function different from splicing, namely control of the steady-state level of HIV-1 RNA in the cell. In a series of genetic experiments we demonstrate that U1 snRNP binding to SD1A is the important factor for the observed increase in RNA level. This resembles the previous observation that the 3U mutant in a different splice donor site, SD4, stabilizes the RNA (21Kammler S. Leurs C. Freund M. Krummheuer J. Seidel K. Tange T.O. Lund M.K. Kjems J. Scheid A. Schaal H. RNA. 2001; 7: 421-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In that study it was shown that reduction of the number of hydrogen bonds between the splice donor site SD1A and the 5′-end of U1 snRNA correlates closely with the cellular HIV-1 RNA level. Thus, a mechanism might exist that prevents degradation of unspliced RNA by occupying all HIV-1 5′-splice sites with U1 snRNP. Such a mechanism seemingly conflicts with the observation that binding of snRNPs leads to nuclear retention of unspliced RNA and that completion of the splicing reaction removes this obstacle to nucleocytoplasmic export of the RNA (30Chang D.D.

However, in the case of HIV-1, export of unspliced RNA is mediated by the Rev protein that may circumvent the retention exerted by U1 snRNP (33Fischer U. Pollard V.W. Luhrmann R. Teufel M.

Our finding that addition of ASF/SF2 to the splicing reaction increases use of the splice donor site SD1A, but does not enhance exon 1A inclusion, supports the idea that this splice site is conserved to function as a U1 snRNP binding site and that this interaction is improved by ASF/SF2. Binding of U1 snRNP may have different effects. It may aid in protecting and stabilizing unspliced HIV-1 mRNA, potentially by recruiting ASF/SF2 that has been shown to stabilize the binding of Rev to the RRE leading to more efficient nuclear export (38Powell D.M. Amaral M.C. Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Alternatively, U1 snRNP may stimulate transcription by interacting with part of the transcriptional machinery (39Kwek K.Y. Murphy S. Furger A. Thomas B. O'Gorman W. Kimura H. Proudfoot N.J. Akoulitchev A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 800-805PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these mechanisms would lead to increased RNA levels in the cell. Two 5′-splice sites, SD1A and SD4, have been shown to mediate the RNA-stabilizing effect. The question remains whether more of the HIV-1 5′-splice sites have a dual function for splicing and RNA stability. We thank D. Trono for pCMVΔR8.2 and Susanne Kammler and Christian Damgaard for fruitful discussions."

Upon stimulation via the antigen receptors, it is tyrosine-phosphorylated and binds Grb2 and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Disruption of the Lax gene causes hyperresponsiveness in T and B lymphocytes. Here, we showed that LAX was also expressed in mast cells. Upon engagement of the FcϵRI, LAX was also phosphorylated and interacted with Grb2 and p85. LAX-deficient mast cells were hyperresponsive to stimulation via the FcϵRI, as evidenced by enhanced degranulation, p38 MAPK, Akt, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation. This hyperresponsiveness was likely a consequence of reduced LAB expression after sensitization of mast cells with anti-dinitrophenyl IgE. In addition, FcϵRI-mediated cytokine production and cell survival were also enhanced. These data suggested that LAX negatively regulates mast cell function.

The high affinity IgE receptor (FcϵRI) is a multichain immune recognition receptor, which signals through the Src and Syk protein tyrosine kinases. After engagement of the FcϵRI at the surface of mast cells, the Src family tyrosine kinase, Lyn, is first activated and phosphorylates the tyrosine residues within the ITAMs of the β and γ chains (1Eiseman E.

Much progress has been made in recent years to define the function of signaling proteins that contribute positively to this pathway; however, it is less clear how this pathway is negatively regulated. Following engagement of the FcϵRI on mast cells, several adaptors, such as SLP-76, Gab2, LAT, and NTAL/LAB, are phosphorylated. Previous studies show that these adaptor proteins play important roles in this pathway (6Gu H. Saito K. Klaman L.D. Shen J. Fleming T. Wang Y. Pratt J.C. Lin G. Lim B. Kinet J.P. Neel B.G.

LAT, linker for activation of T cells, is one of the prominently phosphorylated proteins upon stimulation of mast cells from the FcϵRI (12Saitoh S. Arudchandran R. Manetz T.S. Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Love P.E. Rivera J. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 2000; 12: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In T cells, LAT is phosphorylated and interacts with Grb2, Gads, and PLC-γ1 upon engagement of the TCR (14Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E.

Biol. 1999; 9: 67-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In LAT-deficient Jurkat cells, TCR-mediated Erk activation and calcium flux are completely defective (17Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 18Zhang W. Irvin B.J. Trible R.P. Abraham R.T. Samelson L.E. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Compared with the LAT-deficient Jurkat cells, Lat–/– mast cells have a less severe phenotype. Lat–/– mast cells have reduced phosphorylation of SLP-76, PLC-γ1, and PLC-γ2, and diminished calcium initiated from the FcϵRI; however, they are still capable of fluxing calcium and undergo relatively normal Erk activation. Functionally, LAT deficiency leads to a dramatic reduction in mast cell degranulation and cytokine production (12Saitoh S. Arudchandran R. Manetz T.S. Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Love P.E. Rivera J. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 2000; 12: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Although LAT plays a positive role, a LAT-like molecule, LAB/NTAL, functions to negatively regulate this signaling pathway and mast cell function. In Lab–/– mast cells, FcϵRI-mediated Erk activation, calcium mobilization, degranulation, and cytokine production are all enhanced. Interestingly, mast cells that lack both LAT and LAB proteins have a more severe block in FcϵRI-mediated signaling than Lat–/– mast cells, indicating that LAB also plays a positive role (13Zhu M. Liu Y. Koonpaew S. Granillo O. Zhang W. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition to LAT and LAB/NTAL, LAX is another adaptor molecule that is expressed in lymphocytes. LAX is expressed in T cells, B cells, and monocytes; it has multiple Grb2 motifs very similar to those in LAT. However, different from LAT and LAB, LAX has no palmitoylation motif and is not localized to lipid rafts (19Zhu M. Janssen E. Leung K. Zhang W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46151-46158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of Jurkat T cells via the TCR, LAX is phosphorylated and interacts with Grb2, Gads, and the p85 subunit of PI3K. It is also phosphorylated upon BCR engagement. Overexpression of LAX in Jurkat cells inhibits TCR-mediated p38 MAPK and NFAT/AP1 activation. Despite these results, however, disruption of the Lax gene in mice has no impact on lymphocyte development, Lax–/– T and B cells are hyperresponsive and have a slightly enhanced calcium flux, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and MAPK and Akt activation upon engagement of the T or B cell antigen receptors (20Zhu M. Granillo O. Wen R. Yang K. Dai X. Wang D. Zhang W. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5612-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, our results suggest that LAX functions as a negative regulator in lymphocyte signaling. In this report, we showed that LAX was also expressed in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). Lax–/– BMMCs consistently grew faster in the IL-3 medium than Lax+/+ cells. They were hyperresponsive to stimulation via the FcϵRI likely because of reduced expression of LAB. These data suggested that LAX negatively regulates FcϵRI-mediated signaling and mast cell function.

Staining and Counting of Mast Cells—Mast cells in the peritoneal cavity, skin, and ear were stained with toluidine blue. Peritoneal cells were spun onto microscope slides by cytospin (Cytospin 4 centrifuge, Shandon) and fixed in ice-cold acetone. Pieces of shaved dorsal skin and ear were removed and quickly frozen in O.C.T.(Tissue Tek) before sectioning (5 μm). Fixed peritoneal cells and sections of skin and ear were stained with 0.5% toluidine blue O solution (Sigma). BMMC Activation—Mast cells were derived from bone marrow cells from Lax–/– and Lax+/+ mouse femurs in IMDM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and recombinant IL-3 (5 ng/ml). After being cultured in IL-3 medium for 3 weeks, more than 95% of the cells were FceRIα+c-Kit+. For biochemical analysis, BMMCs (2–5 × 106/ml) were preloaded with anti-DNP IgE (0.5 μg/ml, SPE-7 mAb, Sigma) in IMDM medium without IL-3 for 16 h. Cells were washed with IMDM and then stimulated with DNP-HSA (20 ng/ml) for the indicated time points. A total of 1×107 cells were lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold Brij lysis buffer (1% Brij-97, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4). Lysates were either subjected to immunoprecipitation with different antibodies or analyzed directly by Western blotting. Western Blot—For Western blotting, samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After incubation with primary antibodies, nitrocellulose membranes were washed three times and probed with either anti-mouse or rabbit Ig conjugated to AlexaFluor 680 (Molecular Probes) or IRDye800 (Rockland). Membranes were then visualized with the LI-COR Bioscience Odyssey system (LI-COR). Passive Systemic Anaphylaxis—Mice were first sensitized with 2 μg of anti-DNP-IgE by intravenous injection for 20–24 h. They were then injected intravenously with 20, 100, or 200 μg of DNP-HSA for 1.5 min. Mice were euthanized with CO2, and blood was immediately collected by cardiac puncture. The histamine concentration in serum was determined using a competitive histamine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Immunotech). Ca2+ Flux—BMMCs (2–5 × 106/ml) were preloaded with anti-DNP IgE (0.5 μg/ml) in IMDM without IL-3 for 4 h. Cells were washed twice with IMDM and then loaded with 5 mm Fluo-4, AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. Cells were washed again and further incubated in IMDM for 30 min. DNP-HSA (30 ng/ml) and thapsigargin (1 μm) were used to induce calcium flux in these cells. Ca2+ flux was measured using a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) to monitor the fluorescence emission. Degranulation and Cytokine Production—Degranulation of BMMCs measuring the release of β-hexosaminidase and detection of cytokines by reverse transcription-PCR were performed as previously described (13Zhu M. Liu Y. Koonpaew S. Granillo O. Zhang W. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The concentrations of cytokines secreted by mast cells into the tissue culture supernatant were determined by the mouse 18-Plex cytokine assay according to the manufacture's protocol (Bio-Rad). BMMC Proliferation and Apoptosis Assay—For proliferation, BMMCs (4 × 105 cells/per 96-well) were incubated in either medium alone or with IL-3 (0.1 or 1 ng/ml) for 36 h. [3H]Thymidine (5μCi/ml) was added 6 h before harvesting. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was measured by using a liquid scintillation luminescence counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal, mast cells were washed three with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in the IMDM without IL-3 for an additional 24, 48, and 72 h before stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated Annexin V. Real Time PCR—Total RNAs were extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNAs were synthesized with SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using oligo(dT) as a primer. Quantitation of the Lab RNA was performed by real time PCR using SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The following primers were used to amplify the Lab cDNA, 5′-CCCTCACCCTCAGCCTTA-3′ and 5′-AGCAGCAATAATCCCGACA-3′. The amount of Lab RNA was normalized by β-actin. PIP3 Determination—The PIP3 level was determined using a protocol modified from procedures described previously (21Manetz T.S. Gonzalez-Espinosa C. Arudchandran R. Xirasagar S. Tybulewicz V. Rivera J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3763-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, anti-DNP IgE preloaded cells (1 × 107 cells/ml) were labeled with 0.2 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (MP Biomedicals, carrier-free) in phosphate-free RPMI with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 and 5% phosphate-free fetal bovine serum) for 1.5 h at 37 °C before stimulation with DNP-HSA for 2, 5, and 10 min. The remaining steps were done as previously described (21Manetz T.S. Gonzalez-Espinosa C. Arudchandran R. Xirasagar S. Tybulewicz V. Rivera J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3763-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Expression of LAX in Mast Cells—LAX is expressed in naïve T and B cells and is up-regulated upon engagement of the antigen receptors (19Zhu M. Janssen E. Leung K. Zhang W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46151-46158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To examine whether LAX is also expressed in mast cells and further whether it functions in mast cells, we derived mast cells (BMMCs) from the bone marrow of wild type (Lax+/+) and Lax–/– mice. Bone marrow cells from these mice were cultured in the medium with IL-3. During the culture, Lax–/– bone marrow cells consistently expanded faster than Lax+/+ cells, suggesting that LAX might negatively regulate mast cell growth. To examine the expression of LAX, mast cell lysates were prepared and subjected to anti-LAX immunoprecipitation, followed by Western blotting with an anti-LAX antibody. LAX protein was clearly detected in Lax+/+, not Lax–/– mast cells, indicating that mast cells also express LAX (Fig. 1A). Upon stimulation via the BCR or TCR, LAX is phosphorylated and interacts with Grb2 and p85 (19Zhu M. Janssen E. Leung K. Zhang W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46151-46158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To examine whether LAX is also phosphorylated and interacts with these proteins upon engagement of the FcϵRI, mast cells were sensitized with anti-DNP IgE followed by cross-linking with DNP-HSA for 0, 2, 5, and 10 min before lysis. LAX protein was immunoprecipitated from lysates and analyzed by blotting with anti-pTyr, anti-p85, and Grb2 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B, LAX was weakly phosphorylated upon stimulation of Lax+/+ mast cells. Maximal phosphorylation was at 2 min after stimulation. Anti-LAX antibodies also co-precipitated a nonspecific protein with a molecular mass of ∼65 kDa. Grb2 and p85 were detected in anti-LAX immunoprecipitates from stimulated Lax+/+, not Lax–/– mast cells. A similar amount of lysate was used in each immunoprecipitation as indicated by Western blotting the whole cell lysate with anti-Grb2 and p85 (Fig. 1B). These data indicated that as in T and B cells, LAX is also phosphorylated and interacts with Grb2 and p85 upon activation via the FcϵRI. IgE-dependent Anaphylaxis in Lax–/– Mice—To examine whether LAX deficiency affected mast cell development, mast cells in peritoneal cavity, ear skin, and back skin of Lax–/– and Lax+/+ mice were numerated. Similar numbers of mast cells were observed (Table 1). To examine mast cell function in vivo, passive systemic IgE-dependent anaphylaxis in Lax+/+ and Lax–/– mice was performed. This assay is dependent on in vivo mast cell degranulation and histamine release after engagement of the FcϵRI. Monoclonal anti-DNP IgE was first injected into mice via the tail vein. Twenty hours after injection, mice were then challenged with DNP-HSA (100 μg). 1.5 min after the challenge, blood was collected after euthanasia. Histamine concentration in the blood was measured by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Lax–/– mice were capable of releasing similar amounts of histamine upon challenging with DNP-HSA as Lax+/+ mice (Fig. 2A). We also performed this assay by challenging mice with different doses of DNP-HSA (20, 100, or 200 μg) after sensitization. Similar results were observed (data not shown). These data indicate that LAX deficiency did not lead to a block in mast cell function in vivo.TABLE 1The number of mast cells in peritoneal cavity, ear, and back skinMast cellsLAX-/-LAX+/+Peritoneal cavity (%)3.03 ± 0.344.78 ± 1.01Ear skin (number/cm)257.4 ± 37.7262.1 ± 41.4Back skin (number/cm)261.8 ± 38.5255.4 ± 31.4 Open table in a new tab Enhanced Mast Cell Degranulation—We next determined whether Lax–/– mast cells had normal effector function in vitro by examining antigen-induced degranulation. After cultured in the medium with IL-3 for 3 weeks, more than 95% cells in our BMMC culture expressed FcϵRI and c-Kit. FcϵRI and c-Kit expression was similar on the cell surface of Lax+/+ and Lax–/– cells (Fig. 2B). To examine FcϵRI-mediated degranulation, mast cells were preloaded with anti-DNP-IgE and activated by the addition of increasing amounts of DNP-HSA. The release ofβ-hexosaminidase from granules into the medium was assayed. As indicated in Fig. 2C, antigen-induced degranulation peaked at a concentration of 10 ng/ml for mast cells from Lax+/+ and Lax–/– mice; however, it was significantly enhanced in Lax–/– cells. These cells released similar amounts of β-hexosaminidase in response to thapsigargin, which bypasses the proximal signaling of the FcϵRI (Fig. 2D). FcϵRI-mediated Signaling—To investigate whether FcϵRI-mediated signaling pathway was affected by the disruption of the Lax gene, we first examined the overall tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in Lax–/– cells after the receptor engagement. As shown in Fig. 3A, there were no significant differences in tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins between Lax+/+ and Lax–/– mast cells except that there was increased phosphorylation of proteins with a molecular mass of ∼32 kDa (see below). To examine FcϵRI-mediated calcium flux, mast cells were sensitized with anti-DNP IgE, loaded with a calcium-sensitive dye, Fluo-4, and activated with DNP-HSA. A similar elevation of intracellular calcium after stimulation was seen in Lax+/+ and Lax–/– mast cells (Fig. 3B). Activation via the FcϵRI also leads to activation of three MAPKs, Erk, Jnk, and p38. To examine whether MAPK activation was normal in Lax–/– mast cells, lysates of activated mast cells were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against phosphorylated Erk, Jnk, and p38. Similar amounts of lysates loaded on each lane were indicated by reblotting with antibodies against non-phosphorylated Erk, Jnk, and p38 (Fig. 3B). Although activation of Erk and Jnk was similar in Lax+/+ and Lax–/– mast cells, activation of p38 was much stronger and sustained in Lax–/– cells (Fig. 3C). In addition to p38, Akt activation was also enhanced in Lax–/– cells. Enhanced p38 and Akt activation was not because of increased activation of PTKs after engagement of the FcϵRI. Analysis of lysates by Western blotting with anti-phosphorylated forms of Lyn and Syk showed similar phosphorylation of these PTKs (Fig. 3C). Down-regulation of LAB in Lax–/– Mast Cells—Because of decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins with a molecular mass of ∼32 kDa, the apparent size of LAB on SDS-PAGE in Lax–/– cells (Fig. 3A), we investigated whether LAB expression or tyrosine phosphorylation was affected in these cells. Western blot analysis showed that the amount of LAB protein was decreased dramatically in Lax–/– cells (Fig. 3C). Although it appeared that in Lax–/– cells, cross-linking with DNP-HSA led to further reduction of LAB expression. This was likely because of the fact that our anti-LAB antibodies preferentially recognized nonphosphorylated LAB. Next, we examined whether down-regulation of LAB protein was induced by sensitization with anti-DNP IgE or perhaps Lax–/– mast cells expressed a low amount of LAB after they were derived from bone marrow cells. Lax+/+ and Lax–/– mast cells were sensitized for 1, 6, 16, and 24 h or without sensitization before lysis. LAB expression was detected by Western blotting of the whole cell lysates with anti-LAB. As shown in Fig. 4A, while LAT expression remained the same after sensitization, LAB expression was reduced dramatically after sensitization for 16 or 24 h. The reduced expression of LAB was not at the transcriptional level because the amount of Lab RNA was slightly increased after sensitization (Fig. 4B). Previously we showed that LAB negatively regulates mast cell function by competing with LAT for localization to lipid rafts. We next examined whether LAT localization to rafts was affected in Lax–/– mast cells. After sensitization of Lax–/– and Lax+/+ mast cells with anti-DNP IgE for 16 h, lipid rafts and non-lipid rafts fractions were isolated by a sucrose gradient as we did previously (13Zhu M. Liu Y. Koonpaew S. Granillo O. Zhang W. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Each fraction was analyzed by Western blotting with LAT and LAB antibodies. In Lax–/– mast cells, less LAB protein was detected as expected. In Lax–/– mast cells, more LAT was detected in raft fractions and less LAT in non-raft fractions (Fig. 4C), indicating that LAX deficiency also affects LAT localization to rafts. Together, these data suggested that LAX likely negatively regulates FcϵRI-mediated signaling and mast cell function through LAB. Enhanced Cytokine Production, Cell Survival, and PI3K Activation—Engagement of the FcϵRI also leads to production of multiple cytokines. Cytokine RNA levels in Lax+/+ and Lax–/– cells after stimulation for 0.5, 3, and 6 h were first analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR. Amplification of the actin transcript indicated that similar amounts of cDNAs were used. There were no significant differences in FcϵRI-mediated IL-3, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and tumor growth factor-β RNAs (Fig. 5A), although we observed enhanced Erk, p38, and Akt activation and granule release. However, when we quantitated the amount of cytokines secreted into the medium by these cells, the amount of IL-3, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α produced by Lax–/– cells was slightly higher (Fig. 5B). Because Lax–/– mast cells derived from bone marrow consistently grew faster than Lax+/+ mast cells in the medium with IL-3, we assayed mast cell proliferation in the medium with IL-3 by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Without IL-3 in the medium, mast cells from either Lax+/+ or Lax–/– mast cells failed to proliferate (Fig. 6A). With IL-3 at 0.1 ng/ml and 1 ng/ml, Lax–/– mast cells had more [3H]thymidine incorporated than Lax+/+ mast cells. The increased expansion of Lax–/– mast cells could be due to enhanced proliferation or decreased cell death. To distinguish these two possibilities, mast cells were labeled with CFSE and were allowed to proliferate in the presence of IL-3. The CFSE intensity analyzed by FACS should be diluted after each cell division. No difference in the fluorescence intensity was seen in CFSE-labeled Lax+/+ and Lax–/– mast cells after culturing for 2–5 days (data not shown), suggesting that these cells divided at a similar rate. To examine whether these cells have any differences in cell death, we examined mast cell apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal. Mast cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and cultured for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h without IL-3 before they were stained with phycoerythrin-labeled Annexin V. Annexin V-positive cells were either dying or dead cells. As shown in Fig. 6B, the percentage of Annexin V-positive Lax+/+ cells was significantly more than that of Lax–/– cells at 24, 48, or 72 h after IL-3 withdrawal. Together, these data suggested that faster expansion of Lax–/– mast cell culture is because of reduced cell death. Because we observed enhanced Akt and p38 activation after FcϵRI engagement (Fig. 3B) and increased cell survival after IL-3 withdrawal (Fig. 6B), we asked whether LAX deficiency affects PI3K activity. PI3K plays an important role in Akt activation and cell survival. The p85 subunit of PI3K binds to LAX upon FcϵRI engagement. Lax+/+ and Lax–/– mast cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. The levels of FcϵR1-evoked PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, a product of PI3K, were assayed by thin-layer chromatography. As shown in Fig. 6, C and D, PIP3 production after stimulation was significantly increased in Lax–/– cells compared with it in Lax+/+ cells. These data suggested that LAX negatively regulates FcϵR1-mediated PI3K activation in mast cells. Our previous studies show that overexpression of LAX in Jurkat cells inhibits p38 MAPK activation and TCR-mediated NFAT/AP-1 activation (19Zhu M. Janssen E. Leung K. Zhang W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46151-46158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A disruption of the Lax gene leads to hyperresponsiveness of T and B cells upon stimulation via the TCR or BCR. Tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, p38 MAPK and Akt activation, and cell survival are enhanced in LAX T- and B-deficient cells (20Zhu M. Granillo O. Wen R. Yang K. Dai X. Wang D. Zhang W. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5612-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that LAX was also expressed in bone marrow-derived mast cells. LAX deficiency led to enhanced mast cell degranulation, Akt, and p38 MAPK activation and cell survival. PI3K activity was also increased upon stimulation via the FcϵRI. Taken together, these data suggested that LAX plays an important role in mast cell function by negatively regulating the PI3K pathway. Despite the hyperresponsiveness of LAX-deficient mast cells, we did not observe a significant enhancement of IgE-dependent systemic anaphylaxis in Lax–/– mice. It is possible that there is a compensatory mechanism in vivo to control hyperactivated mast cells. The basal IgE level in naïve Lax–/– mice is higher than that in Lax+/+ mice (20Zhu M. Granillo O. Wen R. Yang K. Dai X. Wang D. Zhang W. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5612-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mast cells in Lax–/– mice might bind less anti-DNP IgE after sensitization because exogenous IgE has to compete with endogenous IgE to bind the FcϵRI. Even though Lax–/– mast cells were hyperresponsive in vitro, they might not be able to release more granules because of reduced receptor engagement. The mechanism by which LAX inhibits PI3K and mast cell function is still not clear. Because tyrosine phosphorylation of LAX is very weak compared with that of LAT, it might be difficult for LAX to compete for binding of Grb2 and p85 with LAT or other proteins. Even though LAX binds to Grb2 and p85 upon engagement of the FcϵRI, whether binding to these two proteins contributes to its negative function remains to be determined. It is possible that LAX binds other negative regulators, such as phosphatases, to turn off FcϵRI-mediated signaling. Our data showed that LAB was down-regulated in Lax–/– cells upon sensitization with anti-DNP-IgE, suggesting that regulation of mast cells by LAX might be mediated via LAB. Recent studies have shown that sensitization of mast cells with IgE not only allows binding of monomeric IgE to the FcϵRI, it can also activate pathways to promote mast cell survival and activation even in the absence of antigen (22Kawakami T. Kitaura J. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 4167-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although we do not know how the LAX deficiency caused the down-regulation of LAB protein in mast cells, it is possible that LAX might form a complex with LAB directly or indirectly to stabilize LAB at the membrane. In the absence of LAX, sensitization of mast cells by IgE through the FcϵRI could initiate signaling events to cause down-regulation of LAB from the cell surface or degradation of LAB. Because LAB is a negative regulator in the FcϵRI-mediated signaling pathway, reduced LAB expression caused mast cells hyperresponsive to stimulation via the FcϵRI by the IgE-antigen complex. How LAX regulates LAB expression in mast cells is very intriguing and remains to be determined in future studies.

Cks proteins domain swap to form dimers but unique to Cks1 is the anti-parallel arrangement of protomers within the dimer. Despite the differences in Cks1 compared with other Cks proteins, we find the domain swapping properties are very similar. However, aggregation of Cks1 occurs by a route distinct from the other Cks proteins studied to date. Cks1 formed fibrillar aggregates at room temperature and neutral pH. During this process, Cks1 underwent proteolytic cleavage at a trypsin-like site into two fragments, the globular Cks domain and the glutamine-rich COOH terminus. At high protein concentrations, the rate of fibril formation was the same as the rate of proteolysis. The dominant species present within the fibrils was the glutamine-rich sequence. Consistent with this result, fibril formation was enhanced by addition of trypsin. Moreover, a truncated variant lacking the glutamine-rich sequence did not form fibrils under the same conditions. A lag phase at low protein concentrations indicates that fibril formation occurs through a nucleation and growth mechanism. The aggregates appear to resemble amyloid fibrils, in that they show the typical cross-β x-ray diffraction pattern. Moreover, infrared spectroscopy data indicate that the glutamine side chains are hydrogen-bonded along the axis of the fibril.

The Cks structure consists of a four-stranded β-sheet capped at one end by two or three short α-helices (3Bourne Y. Watson M.H. Arvai A.S. Bernstein S.L. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A. Structure. 2000; 8: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Cks proteins undergo domain-swapped dimerization via the reciprocal exchange of the COOH-terminal β-strand, both in solution (4Birck C. Raynaud-Messina B. Samama J.P.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), although the very high dissociation constants observed suggest that these proteins do not domain swap in vivo. Domain swapping in Cks proteins is mediated by a highly conserved sequence, the so-called “hinge loop” (8Liu Y. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1285-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) that links the exchanged β-strand with the rest of the protein (Fig. 1A). This part of the protein is the only region where there are differences in conformation between the monomer and dimer forms. The Cks homologue from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cks1, is the largest member of the Cks family and has a unique sequence at the COOH terminus containing 16 consecutive glutamine residues followed by 17 residues rich in glutamine, proline, and serine (Fig. 1B). Also unique is an anti-parallel arrangement of monomer subunits in the domain-swapped dimer form of the protein and a disulfide link between the two subunits as a result of a cysteine residue in the hinge loop (3Bourne Y.

For some amyloid diseases it has been proposed that oligomeric intermediates formed early in the aggregation process may be even more harmful than mature fibrils (17Nilsberth C.

At least nine inherited diseases are caused by CAG repeat expansions, but the proteins involved have little in common, either structurally or functionally, other than the poly(Q) region. Difficulties in working with the full-length proteins, on the one hand, and the low solubility of poly(Q) model peptides, on the other, mean that many details of the poly(Q) aggregation mechanism remain to be resolved. In particular, atomic information on the poly(Q) fibril structure has yet to be obtained and the role played by the non-poly(Q) regions of the proteins in the aggregation process is not yet defined.

Lansbury Jr. P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). In these respects, expanded CAG repeat diseases appear to conform to the unified model of protein misfolding disorders (25Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3701) Google Scholar, 26Dobson C.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar).The two distinct features of Cks1, its glutamine-rich COOH terminus and the anti-parallel orientation of the monomers within the domain-swapped dimer, prompted us to investigate Cks1 folding and aggregation and to compare it with that of other Cks proteins that we have previously analyzed. In particular, we were interested in determining whether aggregation occurs through the poly(Q) region or through the globular region (either by domain swapping or otherwise). We show here that, despite the sequence and structural differences from the other Cks proteins, the domain swapping properties of Cks1 are conserved within members of this family (27Schymkowitz J.W. Rousseau F. Itzhaki L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28Seeliger M.A. Schymkowitz J.W. Rousseau F. Wilkinson H.R. Itzhaki L.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1202-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar); by contrast, aggregation of Cks1 occurs by a route distinct from that of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cks protein, Suc1. Suc1 forms domain-swapped aggregates at neutral pH and room temperature, which subsequently convert to fibrillar aggregates. 9J. W. H. Schymkowitz, F. Rousseau, H. R. Wilkinson, J. Villanueva, L. Serrano, and L. S. Itzhaki, unpublished data. 9J. W. H. Schymkowitz, F. Rousseau, H. R. Wilkinson, J. Villanueva, L. Serrano, and L. S. Itzhaki, unpublished data. For Cks1, we observe fibril formation within a few days at neutral pH and room temperature. These fibrils, however, consist solely of the COOH-terminal glutamine-rich sequence of Cks1, residues 112-150. Fibril formation is dependent on the proteolytic cleavage of the COOH terminus and its rate is greatly increased by the addition of a protease that cleaves the protein at a point in the sequence just before the glutamine-rich region. The results are consistent with a model for the origin of poly(Q) disorders and a subset of other protein misfolding diseases, in which the critical step is the production of a fibrillogenic sequence by proteolysis.MATERIALS AND METHODSHigh purity urea was obtained from Rose Chemicals Ltd. (United Kingdom). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless stated otherwise.Protein Expression and Purification—The coding sequence for Cks1 was amplified from a S. cerevisiae cDNA library by PCR with primers introducing 5′ BamHI and 3′ EcoRI restriction sites. The PCR product was cloned into a pRSET(A) vector (Novagen) modified for the expression of a His6 NH2-terminal fusion protein with a thrombin cleavage site. Correct clones were identified by DNA sequencing (Oswell, University of Southampton). Site-directed mutagenesis (mutants C90V, C90S, P93A, E94P, P95A, and T118, the truncated variant at residue 118) was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and was confirmed by DNA sequencing.C41(DE3) cells were transformed with the plasmid and a small number of colonies were picked from the plate into flasks containing 1 liter of 2TY and ampicillin media. The cells were grown at 37 °C to A600 ∼ 0.6 and then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 300 mm NaCl and 1 mm DTT. As Cks1 from S. cerevisiae contains one cysteine residue, 1 mm DTT was added to all buffers to prevent the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. Cks1 was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography. Protein samples were pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. The monomer and domain-swapped dimer forms of Cks1 were found to be well separated by gel filtration and were collected separately, as described previously for Suc1 (5Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W. Wilkinson H.R. Itzhaki L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5596-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).Determination of Dissociation Constants for Domain Swapping—Determination of dissociation constants for the domain-swapped dimer of Cks1 was carried out as described previously (5Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W. Wilkinson H.R. Itzhaki L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5596-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Briefly, wild-type or mutant Cks1 was incubated at 40 °C at different protein concentrations until the fraction of dimer remained constant with time. Samples were quickly cooled on ice for 5 min and the proportions of monomer and dimer were determined by analytical gel filtration (Amersham Biosciences, S75 Sepharose) at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. The data reflect the monomerdimer equilibrium at 40 °C as the samples do not re-equilibrate significantly at room temperature over the course of the experiment. A plot of the square of the monomer concentration versus the dimer concentration was fitted to a straight line, the slope of which gives the dissociation constant.Transmission Electron Microscopy—Protein samples (at 1.8 mm concentration) were incubated for varying lengths of time at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. For electron microscopy, samples were diluted 100 times and applied to Formvar-coated nickel grids. The blotted sample was negatively stained with 2% (w/v) aqueous uranyl acetate solution and examined in a Philips CM100 electron microscope operated at 80 kV.Experiments with Protease and Protease Inhibitors—1.7 mm Cks1 was incubated either with 0.1 mg/ml trypsin or a protease inhibitor mixture (1 Complete tablet/100 ml, Roche Diagnostics) at room temperature. The samples were then analyzed by mass spectrometry and electron microscopy after 1 and 2 days, respectively.Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectra were collected using a quadrupole time-of-flight-2 mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoflow Z-spray source (Micromass, Manchester, UK) as described previously (29Ilag L.L. Westblade L.F. Deshayes C. Kolb A. Busby S.J. Robinson C.V. Structure. 2004; 12: 269-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Amino Acid Analysis—High-order oligomers of larger than 8 S formed during aggregation of Cks1 were sedimented in a Beckman Optima TLX ultracentrifuge. The supernatant was carefully removed from each sample and the pellet resuspended in water. The two protein fractions were hydrolyzed and analyzed using the standard ion-exchange ninhydrin procedure (30Spackman D.H. Stein W.H. Moore S. Anal. Chem. 1958; 30: 1190-1206Crossref Scopus (6581) Google Scholar).X-ray Fiber Diffraction—Fibrils were purified by sedimentation (as described above) and resuspended at 5-10 mg/ml. X-ray specimens were aligned using a stretch frame by air-drying these samples between two wax-filled capillary ends. Fiber diffraction images were collected on a R-AXIS IV image plate x-ray detector mounted on a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode source of CuKα (1.5418 Å). Images were analyzed by the Java application “Crystal Clear” software.Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy—Samples were placed in a Bio-ATRCell™ II equipped with a silicon crystal. The cell was equilibrated at 25 °C by using a water bath and infrared spectra were recorded with a Bruker Equinox 55 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector. The sample compartment was continuously purged with dry air and 256 interferograms were co-added after registration with a resolution of 2 cm-1. The buffer spectrum was recorded and subsequently subtracted from a protein sample using Protein Dynamics software (Bruker). Corrections for water vapor in the atmosphere were applied where necessary.RESULTSDomain Swapping Behavior of Cks1—To determine whether or not domain swapping leads to aggregation of Cks1, we first quantified the domain swapping propensity of the wild-type protein and of a number of mutants including a variant lacking the glutamine-rich COOH-terminal region. All measurements of domain swapping behavior were carried out in the presence of reducing agent so that the intrinsic propensity of the protein to domain swap could be investigated without the complicating factor of intermolecular disulfide bond formation. The interconversion between the monomeric form of Cks1 and its domain-swapped dimer was found to be very slow at room temperature (several hours, depending on the protein concentration), as observed previously for the S. pombe Cks protein Suc1 (5Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W. Wilkinson H.R. Itzhaki L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5596-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and therefore the Kd was determined at 40 °C to enable the equilibrium distribution of the two forms of the protein to be reached on a reasonable time scale. Wild-type Cks1 is fully folded at this temperature as it is well below its midpoint of denaturation (58 °C from thermal unfolding monitored by CD and fluorescence, data not shown). The same situation holds for the mutants studied here (Table 1) as only small changes (1-2 °C) in the midpoint of denaturation were observed. The proportion of monomer and dimer in each sample was determined by analytical gel filtration, carried out at room temperature so that the distribution of the two species is not perturbed during the time required for these experiments. The monomer and dimer are well separated in the elution profile (Fig. 2A), and the Kd was calculated by measuring the monomer and dimer content of samples at different protein concentrations. A plot of the dimer concentration versus the square of the monomer concentration is linear, indicating that equilibrium was effectively achieved for all protein concentrations investigated (Fig. 2B), and the slope of the line gives the Kd values for the wild-type and mutant Cks1 dimer (Table 1).TABLE 1Experimental parameters for the dissociation of the dimer of wild-type Cks1 and mutants All measurements were made under reducing conditions. The values of Kd published previously for mutational variants with substitutions at equivalent positions in Suc1 (5Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W. Wilkinson H.R. Itzhaki L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5596-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) are shown for comparison. The experimental errors on the dissociation constant of the dimer, Kd, are estimated to be 10%, with the exception of P93A for which measurements were made at protein concentrations very different from the Kd. For this mutant, the value given is an approximation only.Cks1KdSuc1KdμmμmWild type380Wild type1900C90V540V87A2000C90S600P93A92,000P90A9000E94P0.75E91P0.10P95A27P92A180T118970 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Determination of the dissociation constant for the domain-swapped dimer of Cks1.

B, plot of the square of the concentration of monomer versus the concentration of dimer for Cks1 PA95.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To probe the domain swapping properties further, we mutated residues in the hinge loop (residues 91 to 99, sequence HAPEPHILL), the only region of the protein that adopts a different structure in the monomer compared with the dimer. We also investigated whether the glutamine-rich COOH-terminal region modulates the domain swapping propensity of Cks1. Dissociation constants of the domain-swapped dimer for wild-type and mutant Cks1 are given in Table 1 together with those previously measured for Suc1 for comparison. Substitution of the glutamate residue in Cks1 at position 94 by proline, thereby creating three sequential proline residues in the hinge loop, greatly increases the propensity for dimer formation. Moreover, substitution of one or the other of the proline residues at positions 93 and 95 by alanine also has a large effect on the dimerization propensity. The Kd of P93A is much higher, 90 mm, and of P95A much lower, 27 μm, than that of the wild-type protein (380 μm). Mutants in which the cysteine residue, at position 90, was substituted by valine or serine show values of Kd that are only slightly higher than the wild-type value. Most interesting is the observation that truncation of the protein at residue 118 preceding the poly(Q) region (T118) destabilizes the dimer substantially relative to the monomer, increasing the Kd to almost 1 mm.The Poly(Q) Sequence of Cks1 Is the Origin of Fibril Formation—The Cks1 monomer and dimer were incubated for several days at room temperature and under near physiological conditions (pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) and a protein concentration of 1.8 mm. Samples from the solution were taken at regular intervals and examined using negative stain transmission electron microscopy (EM). The samples were found to form clear gels after several days of incubation, a phenomenon that is often indicative of aggregation. The EM images show that both monomer and dimer samples initially form amorphous aggregates, but long, unbranched fibrils appear after a few days (Fig. 3). The fibrils are typically 1-5 μm in length and 20 nm in width. The morphology appears very similar whether the fibrils are formed from the monomeric form or the dimeric form of Cks1 (Fig. 3). Neither the monomeric nor the dimeric form of the truncated variant of Cks1 lacking the poly(Q) region (T118) formed observable fibrils under the conditions used here, although amorphous aggregates were evident.FIGURE 3Fibril formation by the Cks1 monomer and domain-swapped dimer. Negative stain transmission electron micrographs of Cks1 fibrils generated from incubation of protein, at a concentration of 1.8 mm for monomeric wild-type Cks1 and the truncated variant T118 and 0.9 mm for the dimeric wild-type protein (corresponding to 1.8 mm monomers), at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Proteolytic Release of the Poly(Q) Sequence Initiates Fibril Formation—The oligomerization state of Cks1 during the fibril incubation period was probed by analytical gel filtration. The chromatogram obtained for monomeric wild-type Cks1 at the beginning of the incubation period (Fig. 4A) shows a single peak with an elution volume of 16 ml. After 4 days of incubation, two further peaks appear at 14.5 and 17.6 ml. The former peak corresponds to the domain-swapped dimer. The latter peak was subsequently shown by mass spectrometry to correspond to a truncated monomer (M*) (see below). Some of the dimer molecules are also truncated, as is evident from the additional peak at 15.4 ml (D*) observed in the sample that was incubated for 10 days. The elution volumes of the truncated monomer and dimer correspond closely to those of the monomer and dimer of the T118 variant (17.1 and 15.9 ml, respectively). Analysis by mass spectrometry (Fig. 6A) shows that cleavage of the protein takes place at residue Arg111, just prior to the poly(Q) region, where the most COOH-terminal trypsin site in the sequence is located (Fig. 1B). The fact that cleavage occurs in the samples may be attributed to trace quantities of proteases remaining after purification. No cleavage was observed for T118, even though the trypsin site at position Arg111 is still present in this truncated variant. Possible explanations for this protease resistance are given under “Discussion.” The mass spectrometry data also reveal that heterodimers composed of full-length and truncated protein molecules were also present in the solutions after 1 day, as were oligomers of the poly(Q) fragment produced by proteolysis. Fig. 4B shows a plot of the total areas of the elution peaks from the truncated monomeric and dimeric species as a function of incubation time. The time courses of the proteolytic cleavage of the wild-type and mutants of Cks1 (Fig. 4B) reflect those observed for gel formation; the wild-type and P93A monomer form gels after 7 days of incubation, the E94P monomer after 12 days and the E94P dimer after 15 days. The results are consistent with the fibrils being composed of the cleaved poly(Q) region, and they indicate that the rate-limiting step of fibril formation under the conditions used here is the proteolytic reaction through which this region is generated.FIGURE 4Proteolytic cleavage of Cks1 wild-type and mutant proteins monitored by gel filtration. A, analytical gel filtration (Superdex 200) elution profiles recorded during the incubation of Cks1 (conditions as described for Fig. 3). The elution peaks of monomer (M) and dimer (D) and their respective cleavage products (M* and D*) (confirmed subsequently by mass spectrometry) are labeled. B, cleavage time course shown as the total intensity of the elution peaks of the cleaved monomer M* plus 2/3 of the peak intensity of the cleaved dimer D* versus time. This takes into account that the elution peak D* consists of a mixture of fully cleaved dimers and partly cleaved heterodimers and assumes that they occur in a ratio of 1:2, respectively. Cytidine (elution volume 21 ml) was added to the protein solution at the start of the experiment as an internal standard to normalize the measured intensities.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6ESI-MS spectra and amino acid analysis of wild-type Cks1 after incubation at room temperature.

https://openalex.org/W2129445728,"During cardiac ischemia, ATP stores are depleted, and cardiomyocyte intracellular pH lowers to <7.0. The acidic pH acts on the Kir6.2 subunit of K(ATP) channels to reduce its sensitivity to ATP, causing channel opening. We recently reported that syntaxin-1A (Syn-1A) binds nucleotide binding folds (NBF)-1 and NBF2 of sulfonylurea receptor 2A (SUR2A) to inhibit channel activity (Kang, Y., Leung, Y. M., Manning-Fox, J. E., Xia, F., Xie, H., Sheu, L., Tsushima, R. G., Light, P. E., and Gaisano, H. Y. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 47125-47131). Here, we examined Syn-1A actions on SUR2A to influence the pH regulation of cardiac K(ATP) channels. K(ATP) channel currents from inside-out patches excised from Kir6.2/SUR2A expressing HEK293 cells and freshly isolated cardiac myocytes were increased by reducing intracellular pH from 7.4 to 6.8, which could be blocked by increasing concentrations of Syn-1A added to the cytoplasmic surface. Syn-1A had no effect on C-terminal truncated Kir6.2 (Kir6.2-deltaC26) channels expressed in TSA cells without the SUR subunit. In vitro binding and co-immunoprecipitation studies show that Syn-1A binding to SUR2A or its NBF-1 and NBF-2 domain proteins increased progressively as pH was reduced from 7.4 to 6.0. The enhancement of Syn-1A binding to SUR2A by acidic pH was further regulated by Mg2+ and ATP. Therefore, pH regulates Kir.6.2/SUR2A channels not only by its direct actions on the Kir6.2 subunit but also by modulation of Syn-1A binding to SUR2A. The increased Syn-1A binding to the SUR2A at acidic pH would assert some inhibition of the K(ATP) channels, which may serve as a brake to temper the fluctuation of low pH-induced K(ATP) channel opening that could induce fatal reentrant arrhythmias."
