https://openalex.org/W1984660399,"ONE of us (T. N.) has carried out extensive studies1 on the chemical properties of hinokitiol (4-isopropylcycloheptatrien-2,4,6-ol-2-one-1) and assumed its structure to be the resonance hybrid among various electronic structures of the types, A, B and C2. He also succeeded in synthesizing this compound and its mother substance, tropolone."
https://openalex.org/W1999204915,"BECAUSE the enzyme named ‘aconitase’1 catalyses the conversion of cis-aconitate both to citrate and to isocitrate (and the reverse reactions), it has been thought2 that it may be a mixture of two enzymes, though Buchanan and Anfinsen3 found no evidence of this."

https://openalex.org/W2377440618,"IT is well established by previous workers that the glandular component of the pituitary in teleosts is derived from the ectoderm of the buccal cavity. Haller1, Matthews2, and Kerr3 have observed that the first appearance of the pituitary in all teleosts is as a solid ectodermal inpushing of the buccal epithelium, without any cellular differentiation, which extends below the brain and becomes stalked. This does not at any time possess a hypophyseal cavity."

https://openalex.org/W2089194853,"IN recent studies of the effects of ionizing radiations on aqueous solutions of compounds containing amino-groups such as, for example, amino-acids1, adenine2, nucleic acids2,3, it has been shown that, among other changes, ammonia is formed. In the case of the nucleic acids, for example, the ammonia arises from the constituent purine and pyrimidine bases as a result of a deamination process involving the radicals OH and HO2, which are formed in the primary radiation process according to4: which in the presence of oxygen is followed by: H + O2 → HO2."
https://openalex.org/W2000943648,"DURING an investigation of the conversion products of porphobilinogen in the urine in cases of acute porphyria, it was observed that the fluorescence of the ether/glacial acetic acid extracts of the urine increased considerably when the extracts were left at room temperature for a day or two. This might indicate the formation of coproporphyrin from a chromogen extracted by ether/glacial acetic acid, and such a chromogen has not apparently been previously described."

https://openalex.org/W1994979109,"SINCE the publication of our communication on the slow neutron cross-sections of molybdenum and bromine (Nature, 166, 825; 1950) further analysis of the bromine sample has revealed the presence of some impurities (principally chlorine). After applying the small corrections, the experimental points are best fitted by the equation:"
https://openalex.org/W2009374572,"IN connexion with a problem on the determination of the ultra-violet absorption spectra of organic molecules dissolved in 95 per cent ethyl alcohol1, it was necessary to determine the suitability of the alcohol as a solvent in the region of 2000 A. There is a report2 that carefully purified 95 per cent ethyl alcohol3 is suitable for the region of 2000 A., although no experimental results were given. Observations in this region have been reported by MacLean, Jencks and Acree4 for ordinary commercial 95 per cent ethanol, and they find that unpurified alcohol is completely opaque in this region."
