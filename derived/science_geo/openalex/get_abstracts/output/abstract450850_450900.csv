Inspired by a theoretical prediction of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in magnetically doped topological insulator thin films, Chang et al. (p. 167 , published online 14 March; see the Perspective by Oh ) prepared thin films of the compound Cr0.15(Bi0.1Sb0.9)1.85Te3, with Cr as the magnetic dopant. They observed a plateau in the Hall resistance as a function of the gating voltage without any applied magnetic fields, signifying the achievement of the QAH state."

Advances The latest developments have shown that optical metasurfaces comprising a class of optical MMs with a reduced dimensionality can exhibit exceptional abilities for controlling the flow of light; achieve the anomalously large photonic density of states; and, similar to their bulk analog, provide superresolution imaging. Such a planar photonics technology is expected to facilitate new physics and enhanced functionality for devices that are distinctly different from those observed in their three-dimensional MM counterparts. As a result, this technology will enable new applications in imaging, sensing, data storage, quantum information processing, and light harvesting. Outlook The recent progress in optical metasurfaces can address the major issues hampering the full-scale development of MM technology, such as high loss, cost-ineffective fabrication, and challenging integration. The studies of new, low-loss, tunable plasmonic materials—such as transparent conducting oxides and intermetallics—that can be used as building blocks for metasurfaces will complement the exploration of smart designs and advanced switching capabilities. This progress in metasurface design and realization will lead to novel functionalities and improved performance and may result in the development of new types of ultrathin metasurface designs with unparalleled properties, including increased operational bandwidths and reduced losses. These new designs would also be compatible with planar, low-cost manufacturing. In turn, these advances will lead to ultrathin devices with unprecedented functionalities, ranging from dynamic spatial light modulation to pulse shaping and from subwavelength imaging or sensing to novel quantum optics devices."

However, it is unclear which synaptic projections from the mPFC to subcortical regions are critical for maintaining the proper balance between retention and generalization of fear memory details. Using an array of behavioral, physiological, and anatomical techniques, Xu and Südhof (p. 1290 ) describe a neural circuit that controls memory generalization and specificity. This circuit involves the nucleus reuniens (NR), a thalamic nucleus of largely unknown function. Optogenetic activation of NR neurons in awake behaving mice revealed the role of the NR in fear memory generalization."

Most cells differentiate into short-lived effectors that help to clear the pathogen, whereas others form long-lived memory cells to protect against reinfection. Gerlach et al. (p. 635 , published online 14 March) and Buchholz et al. (p. 630 , published online 14 March) used in vivo fate mapping of mouse T cells with a defined specificity during a bacterial infection to show that the dynamics of the single-cell response are not uniform. The response of a particular T cell population is the average of a small number of clones that expand greatly (“large clones”) and many clones that only proliferate at low amounts (“small clones”). The memory pool arises largely from small clones whereas effectors are primarily made up of large clones."
https://openalex.org/W2134440878,"DNA methylation and demethylation have been proposed to play an important role in somatic cell reprogramming. Here, we demonstrate that the DNA hydroxylase Tet1 facilitates pluripotent stem cell induction by promoting Oct4 demethylation and reactivation. Moreover, Tet1 (T) can replace Oct4 and initiate somatic cell reprogramming in conjunction with Sox2 (S), Klf4 (K), and c-Myc (M). We established an efficient TSKM secondary reprogramming system and used it to characterize the dynamic profiles of 5-methylcytosine (5mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), and gene expression during reprogramming. Our analysis revealed that both 5mC and 5hmC modifications increased at an intermediate stage of the process, correlating with a transition in the transcriptional profile. We also found that 5hmC enrichment is involved in the demethylation and reactivation of genes and regulatory regions that are important for pluripotency. Our data indicate that changes in DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation play important roles in genome-wide epigenetic remodeling during reprogramming."

https://openalex.org/W2045895264,"Determining the atmospheric structure and chemical composition of an exoplanet remains a formidable goal. Fortunately, advancements in the study of exoplanets and their atmospheres have come in the form of direct imaging--spatially resolving the planet from its parent star--which enables high-resolution spectroscopy of self-luminous planets in jovian-like orbits. Here, we present a spectrum with numerous, well-resolved molecular lines from both water and carbon monoxide from a massive planet orbiting less than 40 astronomical units from the star HR 8799. These data reveal the planet's chemical composition, atmospheric structure, and surface gravity, confirming that it is indeed a young planet. The spectral lines suggest an atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen ratio that is greater than that of the host star, providing hints about the planet's formation."
https://openalex.org/W2009166526,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins play important roles in repressing lineage-specific genes and maintaining the undifferentiated state of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However, how PcG proteins are recruited to their target genes is largely unknown. Here, we show that the H3K36-specific histone demethylase Kdm2b is highly expressed in mESCs and regulated by the pluripotent factors Oct4 and Sox2 directly. Depletion of Kdm2b in mESCs causes de-repression of lineage-specific genes and induces early differentiation. The function of Kdm2b depends on its CxxC-ZF domain, which mediates its genome-wide binding to CpG islands (CGIs). Kdm2b interacts with the core components of polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and recruits the complex to the CGIs of early lineage-specific genes. Thus, our study not only reveals an Oct4-Sox2-Kdm2b-PRC1-CGI regulatory axis and its function in maintaining the undifferentiated state of mESCs, but also demonstrates a critical function of Kdm2b in recruiting PRC1 to the CGIs of lineage-specific genes to repress their expression."
https://openalex.org/W1977765763,"The identification of precise mutations is required for a complete understanding of the underlying molecular and evolutionary mechanisms driving adaptive phenotypic change. Using plasticine models in the field, we show that the light coat color of deer mice that recently colonized the light-colored soil of the Nebraska Sand Hills provides a strong selective advantage against visually hunting predators. Color variation in an admixed population suggests that this light Sand Hills phenotype is composed of multiple traits. We identified distinct regions within the Agouti locus associated with each color trait and found that only haplotypes associated with light trait values have evidence of selection. Thus, local adaptation is the result of independent selection on many mutations within a single locus, each with a specific effect on an adaptive phenotype, thereby minimizing pleiotropic consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2064753282,"Magnetic Droplet When a solitary wave travels atop the surface of a fluid, its shape generally changes with time, with some of its components traveling at velocities slightly different than others. In nonlinear media, this spreading effect may be countered by a slimming effect stemming from the non-linearity, which generates an object with perfectly preserved shape, called a soliton. Solitons have been observed in fluids, granular media, and other systems. Mohseni et al. (p. 1295 ) detected a dissipative soliton (one that also balances gain and dissipation) in a magnetic system, in the form of a magnetic droplet consisting of a core of spins pointing opposite to the external magnetic field. The droplet exhibited peculiar dynamics and could be controlled by electric current."
https://openalex.org/W2053674184,"BRCA1 promotes homologous recombination repair and antagonizes 53BP1-dependent nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. However, the molecular basis of the competition between BRCA1 and 53BP1 pathways remains elusive. Here we report that RIF1 protein translocates to damage sites via ATM-dependent 53BP1 phosphorylation. Strikingly, loss of RIF1 rescues initial DNA end resection and checkpoint activation in BRCA1-depleted cells. Interestingly RIF1 accumulation at damage sites is antagonized by BRCA1 in S and G2 phases. Conversely, the translocation of BRCA1 to damage sites is inhibited by RIF1 in G1 phase. However, loss of RIF1 differs from that of 53BP1 deficiency, as it cannot fully rescue RAD51 foci formation, homologous recombination defect, and radio-hypersensitivity in BRCA1-deficient cells. This is likely because RIF1, but not 53BP1, also regulates the foci formation and chromatin loading of BLM (the Bloom syndrome helicase). Thus, RIF1 not only acts downstream of 53BP1 and counteracts BRCA1-mediated end resection but also has a secondary role in promoting BLM function in DNA repair."

Lever et al. (p. 1305 ) directly sampled the subseafloor community off the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge in the Pacific Ocean and found evidence for ongoing microbial sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. Multiyear incubation experiments with samples of host rock confirmed the microbial activities measured in situ."
https://openalex.org/W2080401754,Surface Molecules Not Quite Desorbing The dynamics of molecules desorbing from or adsorbing on surfaces requires that molecules rapidly gain or lose a large amount or translational and rotational energy to enter or leave the gas phase. An intermediate precursor state has long been invoked in which molecules interact weakly with the surface but translate along it and exchange energy without forming localized surface bonds. Dell'Angela et al. (p. 1302 ) found evidence for such a state in changes in x-ray absorption and emission spectra of CO molecules adsorbed on a ruthenium surface after optical excitation rapidly heated the surface. The use of a free electron laser provided high time resolution for x-ray spectroscopy studies. Density function theory and modeling of high temperature states revealed a state that forms from molecules that have not overcome the desorption barrier during heating and that are bonded less strongly than the chemisorbed state.
https://openalex.org/W2143472860,"Valosin-containing protein (VCP) is a highly expressed member of the type II AAA+ ATPase family. VCP mutations are the cause of inclusion body myopathy, Paget's disease of the bone, and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) and they account for 1%-2% of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Using fibroblasts from patients carrying three independent pathogenic mutations in the VCP gene, we show that VCP deficiency causes profound mitochondrial uncoupling leading to decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption. This mitochondrial uncoupling results in a significant reduction of cellular ATP production. Decreased ATP levels in VCP-deficient cells lower their energy capacity, making them more vulnerable to high energy-demanding processes such as ischemia. Our findings propose a mechanism by which pathogenic VCP mutations lead to cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2040946687,"Protein kinase clients are recruited to the Hsp90 molecular chaperone system via Cdc37, which simultaneously binds Hsp90 and kinases and regulates the Hsp90 chaperone cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 in vivo results in degradation of kinase clients, with a therapeutic effect in dependent tumors. We show here that Cdc37 directly antagonizes ATP binding to client kinases, suggesting a role for the Hsp90-Cdc37 complex in controlling kinase activity. Unexpectedly, we find that Cdc37 binding to protein kinases is itself antagonized by ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors, including vemurafenib and lapatinib. In cancer cells, these inhibitors deprive oncogenic kinases such as B-Raf and ErbB2 of access to the Hsp90-Cdc37 complex, leading to their degradation. Our results suggest that at least part of the efficacy of ATP-competitive inhibitors of Hsp90-dependent kinases in tumor cells may be due to targeted chaperone deprivation."

https://openalex.org/W2095767079,"In blood, the transcription factor C/EBPa is essential for myeloid differentiation and has been implicated in regulating self-renewal of fetal liver haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, its function in adult HSCs has remained unknown. Here, using an inducible knockout model we found that C/EBPa-deficient adult HSCs underwent a pronounced increase in number with enhanced proliferation, characteristics resembling fetal liver HSCs. Consistently, transcription profiling of C/EBPa-deficient HSCs revealed a gene expression program similar to fetal liver HSCs. Moreover, we observed that age-specific Cebpa expression correlated with its inhibitory effect on the HSC cell cycle. Mechanistically we identified N-Myc as a downstream target of C/EBPa, and loss of C/EBPa resulted in de-repression of N-Myc. Our data establish C/EBPa as a central determinant in the switch from fetal to adult HSCs. How the characteristic quiescent status of adult HSCs is maintained is not well understood. Tenen and colleagues show that the transcription factor C/EBP is required to maintain a low proliferation rate in adult HSCs, partly through N-Myc repression."

(p. 1298 ; see the Perspective by Sethmann ) used the protein silicatein-α, which is responsible for the biomineralization of silicates in sponges, to guide the formation of spicules made of calcite. These synthetic spicules could be bent to a high degree because of their inherent elasticity, whilst retaining the ability to guide light."
https://openalex.org/W2103117581,"Previous studies had implicated the IFN-γ transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) as a tumor suppressor. However, accumulating evidence has correlated increased STAT1 activation with increased tumor progression in multiple types of cancer, including breast cancer. Indeed, we present evidence that tumor up-regulation of STAT1 activity in human and mouse mammary tumors correlates with increasing disease progression to invasive carcinoma. A microarray analysis comparing low aggressive TM40D and highly aggressive TM40D-MB mouse mammary carcinoma cells revealed significantly higher STAT1 activity in the TM40D-MB cells. Ectopic overexpression of constitutively active STAT1 in TM40D cells promoted mobilization of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and inhibition of antitumor T cells, resulting in aggressive tumor growth in tumor-transplanted, immunocompetent mice. Conversely, gene knockdown of STAT1 in the metastatic TM40D-MB cells reversed these events and attenuated tumor progression. Importantly, we demonstrate that in human breast cancer, the presence of tumor STAT1 activity and tumor-recruited CD33(+) myeloid cells correlates with increasing disease progression from ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma. We conclude that STAT1 activity in breast cancer cells is responsible for shaping an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and inhibiting STAT1 activity is a promising immune therapeutic approach."

The molecular basis for how these proteins recognize and bind ice is not well understood. The longhorn beetle Rhagium inquisitor can supercool to below −25 °C, in part by synthesizing the most potent antifreeze protein studied thus far (RiAFP). We report the crystal structure of the 13-kDa RiAFP, determined at 1.21 Å resolution using direct methods. The structure, which contains 1,914 nonhydrogen protein atoms in the asymmetric unit, is the largest determined ab initio without heavy atoms. It reveals a compressed β-solenoid fold in which the top and bottom sheets are held together by a silk-like interdigitation of short side chains. RiAFP is perhaps the most regular structure yet observed. It is a second independently evolved AFP type in beetles. The two beetle AFPs have in common an extremely flat ice-binding surface comprising regular outward-projecting parallel arrays of threonine residues. The more active, wider RiAFP has four (rather than two) of these arrays between which the crystal structure shows the presence of ice-like waters. Molecular dynamics simulations independently reproduce the locations of these ordered crystallographic waters and predict additional waters that together provide an extensive view of the AFP interaction with ice.

Davies P.L. Antifreeze proteins: an unusual receptor-ligand interaction.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 101-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that AFPs adsorb to the surface of nascent ice crystals. Upon adsorption to ice, AFPs block water molecules from accessing the ice surface at the bound location. The ice front thus becomes convex toward the solution between the surface-bound AFPs, which is energetically unfavorable for ice growth by the Gibbs-Thompson-Herring effect (2Raymond J.A.

This results in thermal hysteresis, or the noncolligative depression of the freezing point of the solution without altering its melting temperature. Although the adsorption-inhibition mechanism for ice growth inhibition has been generally accepted for >30 years, the mechanism by which AFPs recognize and bind ice has gone through several radical revisions without a consensus emerging. Recent simulations reveal that in contrast to other inorganic surfaces to which proteins may bind, an ice surface is disordered at the molecular level, with a 1–2-nm transition region separating ice from the surrounding bulk water solution (5Hayward J.A.

Oxford University Press, Oxford1974: 525-725Google Scholar) with the angle between hydrogen bonds in the crystal lattice approximating the tetrahedral angle of 109.5°. By slicing this crystalline lattice at different angles, various two-dimensional ice surfaces are exposed that represent different planes of ice. It has been proposed recently that the ice-binding residues of antifreeze proteins might organize waters into an ice-like configuration that matches and merges with the quasiliquid layer at the ice/water interface (7Garnham C.P.

The ordered waters match specific ice planes, facilitating interaction between the AFP and ice and thereby influencing ice crystal morphology.

The richness in structural folds found in AFPs represents an exceptional example of radically different proteins serving the same function through convergent evolution. Although the most active (hyperactive) AFPs thus far are found in insects, they have proven difficult to produce in sufficient quantities for crystallographic determination (17Lin F.H. Davies P.L.

The difficulty of recombinant expression has also limited the use of the hyperactive AFPs as cryoprotective agents for applications outside of basic science (18Venketesh S. Dayananda C. Properties, potentials, and prospects of antifreeze proteins.Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 2008; 28: 57-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).

Because the mechanism of ice recognition by antifreeze proteins is not well understood, a structural study of RiAFP could provide new insights into the molecular basis for antifreeze activity as well as the adaptations which proteins have acquired to fold and function at temperatures as low as −25 °C. Structural comparisons of RiAFP with other insect AFPs may also provide important molecular insights into their convergent evolution and the basis for antifreeze hyperactivity. Here, we report the crystal structure of RiAFP determined at 1.21 Å resolution by ab initio direct methods. Direct methods provide an alternative for macromolecular crystal structure determination at atomic resolution (beyond 1.2 Å) in the absence of experimental phases or an adequate molecular replacement search model. However, proteins with >1,000 nonhydrogen atoms have been recalcitrant to structure determination by direct methods, especially without anomalous scatterers in the crystal (23Mooers B.H. Matthews B.W. Extension to 2268 atoms of direct methods in the ab initio determination of the unknown structure of bacteriophage P22 lysozyme.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The RiAFP structure presented here is the largest determined ab initio without heavy atoms. Our structure has a square prism shape and reveals a novel β-solenoid architecture with an ice-binding surface (IBS) containing a remarkably regular and extensive array of threonine residues. The IBS is exceptionally flat and holds crystallographic waters in a pattern that matches the primary prism plane of hexagonal ice. Based on simulations these waters occupy natural positions and help recruit other waters, some of which match the basal plane. A fluorescence-based ice etching experiment reveals that GFP-tagged RiAFP can bind the entire surface of a single crystal hemisphere, suggesting affinity to basal, primary prism and additional planes of ice. Cloning, expression, purification, and crystallization of RiAFP were reported previously (24Hakim A. Thakral D. Zhu D.F. Nguyen J.B. Expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary crystallographic studies of Rhagium inquisitor antifreeze protein.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2012; 68: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Diffraction data for RiAFP were collected using a 1.1 Å synchrotron radiation source at Brookhaven National Laboratory (beamline X25) (24Hakim A. Thakral D. Zhu D.F. Nguyen J.B. Expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary crystallographic studies of Rhagium inquisitor antifreeze protein.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2012; 68: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and processed to 1.147 Å resolution with XDS (25Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11228) Google Scholar). Data collected on a 1.54 Å copper anode x-ray source were not of sufficient quality for structure determination ab initio or by more conventional methods. Molecular replacement using other insect antifreeze protein crystal structures as search models did not yield any obvious solutions. The high resolution diffraction (1.15 Å resolution, albeit with only 8.3% completeness in the highest resolution shell, see Table 1) prompted us to consider ab initio methods. Initial phases were obtained by applying the charge flipping program SUPERFLIP, which is mostly used for small molecule crystal structure determination (26Oszlányi G. Süto A. Ab initio structure solution by charge flipping.Acta Crystallogr. A. 2004; 60: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 27Palatinus L. Ab initio determination of incommensurately modulated structures by charge flipping in superspace.Acta Crystallogr. A. 2004; 60: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The resulting electron density map was input into PEAKMAX in the CCP4 (28Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) suite for peak picking. The all-water “dummy atom” model produced by PEAKMAX was then used as the starting model for ACORN (29Jia-xing Y. Woolfson M.M. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. A modified ACORN to solve protein structures at resolutions of 1.7 Å or better.Acta Crystallogr. D. 2005; 61: 1465-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The observed data were artificially extended to 1.0 Å with anisotropy corrections in ACORN. The phases derived from ACORN were input into Arp/wArp (30Langer G. Cohen S.X. Lamzin V.S. Perrakis A. Automated macromolecular model building for x-ray crystallography using ARP/wARP version 7.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar) for automatic model building. The β-strands built from Arp/wArp runs (Fig. 1A) were used as a molecular replacement search model in PHENIX (31Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W.

Macromolecular TLS refinement in REFMAC at moderate resolutions.Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 300-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) were performed. Notably, even with most of the structure built (20 of the total 26 β-strands, Fig. 1B), electron density for the surrounding loops was weak or absent, prompting us to reexamine the data and reprocess it in space group P31 and P1. Molecular replacement in P31 followed by automated model building with Arp/wArp yielded a nearly complete structure. The structure was ultimately refined in space group P3121 with Rwork = 12.76% and Rfree = 15.10%. The six C-terminal histidine residues from the affinity purification tag in chain A were clearly visible in the electron density map. However, residues 90–91 and the polyhistidine tag in chain B were disordered but with some residual electron density in the area. There are two RiAFP molecules in the asymmetric unit with a solvent content of ∼42.8%.

Open table in a new tab Fluorescence-based ice plane affinity analysis and thermal hysteresis measurements were performed as described in (7Garnham C.P. Campbell R.L. Davies P.L. Anchored clathrate waters bind antifreeze proteins to ice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 7363-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Purified RiAFP (∼10 mg/ml) and GFP-RiAFP (5 mg/ml) were injected onto a Superdex 75 (10/300) column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, coupled to a DAWN EOS spectrometer and OPTILAB DSP interferometric refractometer (Wyatt Technologies) at 25 °C. Peaks were detected as they eluted off the column with a UV detector at 280 nm, a light scattering detector at 690 nm, and a refractive index detector. The molar mass of the protein sample was determined from the Debye plot of light scattering intensity versus scattering angle. Data processing was performed with ASTRA software (Wyatt Technology Corp.). A simulation to locate water molecule positions on the IBS of RiAFP was performed as described previously (34Garnham C.P. Campbell R.L. Walker V.K. Davies P.L. Novel dimeric β-helical model of an ice nucleation protein with bridged active sites.BMC Struct. Biol. 2011; 11: 36Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with slight differences. The simulation consisted of an energy minimization step and two position-restrained molecular dynamics steps. The solvent in the box contained 6,220 water molecules and 5 Cl− ions to offset the charge of the protein. The first position-restrained step was a 100-ps simulation in which the system volume remained constant. The second position-restrained step involved a 20-ns simulation in which the system pressure remained constant, saving data at 0.02-ns intervals. The trajectory of the constant-pressure position-restrained simulation was used to calculate the water density around the protein after doing a least squares fit of the protein backbone using the first frame as a reference. Water density was calculated using the VolMap plugin (version 1.1) of VMD (version 1.9.1) with a resolution of 0.5 Å, atom size 1 Å, weights as mass, computed as the average for all saved frames. Waters were manually built into peaks in the VolMap density using PyMOL. The RiAFP structure, which contains 1,914 nonhydrogen protein atoms and no atom heavier than sulfur in the asymmetric unit (26 kDa), is the largest structure determined to date by direct methods without anomalous scattering data. It also represents the first structure determined by direct methods at a resolution limit lower than 1.0 Å that has >1,000 nonhydrogen atoms. The procedure for ab initio structure determination presented here significantly extends the capability of direct methods and provides an alternative to traditional heavy atom-based methods for proteins of up to 26-kDa when crystallographic data are available to 1.2 Å or beyond. Data and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. The structure of RiAFP reveals a new β-solenoid architecture in which the polypeptide chain follows a mixed handed superhelical trajectory to form a β-sandwich of two parallel 6- and 7-stranded β-sheets (Fig. 2, A and B). The central section forms a left handed superhelix of remarkable regularity where the β-sheets lie on top of each other with the upper and lower strands parallel but in the opposite orientation. The only deviations from this handedness and helix regularity occur at either end to form β-helix capping structures (Fig. 2B). At the N terminus there is a reversal of the handedness of the first two strands (β1 and β2), which results in β1 and β2 being antiparallel with their neighboring strands. At the C terminus, β-strands 12 and 13 loop back to insert between strands 10 and 11. These capping structures help to prevent end-to-end associations that would spoil the solubility of RiAFP and lead to oligomerization and aggregation. The three residues in β-strand 11 at the C terminus (Gln110, Gln112, and Ile114) that are too bulky to be accommodated into the core may also contribute to the capping structure to prevent amyloid-like polymerization. Several AFPs have independently evolved to have a β-solenoid fold, including CfAFP from spruce budworm (21Leinala E.K. Davies P.L. Doucet D. Tyshenko M.G. Walker V.K. Jia Z.

Chem. 2002; 277: 33349-33352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), TmAFP from yellow mealworm beetles (14Liou Y.C. Tocilj A. Davies P.L. Jia Z. Mimicry of ice structure by surface hydroxyls and water of a beta-helix antifreeze protein.Nature. 2000; 406: 322-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and MpAFP from an Antarctic bacterium (7Garnham C.P. Campbell R.L. Davies P.L. Anchored clathrate waters bind antifreeze proteins to ice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 7363-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Also, the AFP from an inchworm (a different moth species from the spruce budworm) has been modeled as a β-solenoid (17Lin F.H. Davies P.L. Graham L.A. The Thr- and Ala-rich hyperactive antifreeze protein from inchworm folds as a flat silk-like β-helix.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 4467-4478Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Whereas β-solenoids often form multimers (35Kajava A.V. Steven A.C. β-Rolls, β-helices, and other β-solenoid proteins.Adv. Protein Chem. 2006; 73: 55-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the AFPs are distinctly monomeric and are essentially devoid of twist. The lack of twist exemplified in RiAFP (Fig. 2, B and C) is essential for forming a flat IBS. A novel feature of the RiAFP solenoid is its compressed nature. In the core of RiAFP, the side chains within apposed β-strands from the two β-sheets are staggered, allowing the side chains to interdigitate and pack tightly against one another (Fig. 3). Similar interdigitation was observed in silk fibers (36Asakura T. Yao J. 13C CP/MAS NMR study on structural heterogeneity in Bombyx mori silk fiber and their generation by stretching.Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2706-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and was predicted in an inchworm AFP model (17Lin F.H.

The Thr- and Ala-rich hyperactive antifreeze protein from inchworm folds as a flat silk-like β-helix.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 4467-4478Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Most of the side chains in the core are from alanine and serine, with no residue larger than threonine. With this configuration, the average distance between the sheets is only 6 Å, compared with 10 Å across for TmAFP (14Liou Y.C. Tocilj A. Davies P.L. Jia Z. Mimicry of ice structure by surface hydroxyls and water of a beta-helix antifreeze protein.Nature. 2000; 406: 322-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and 14 Å across for CfAFP (21Leinala E.K. Davies P.L. Doucet D. Tyshenko M.G. Walker V.K. Jia Z. A β-helical antifreeze protein isoform with increased activity: structural and functional insights.J. Biol.

Crystal structure of β-helical antifreeze protein points to a general ice binding model.Structure. 2002; 10: 619-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), creating a more compact fold that may contribute to the high stability and antifreeze activity of RiAFP. In addition to the hydrophobic interactions within the core, hydrogen bonds between Thr65-Ser55, Thr85-Ser75, and Thr132-Ser124, along with a single disulfide bond between Cys4 and Cys21, link the two sheets together to further stabilize the β-sandwich fold. The β-turns in the structure contain mostly glycine or proline residues. Two types of insect AFPs (TmAFP and CfAFP) contain repeated TXT motifs organized into arrays that form the ice-binding sites of the proteins (Figs. 2D and 4, C and F). Mutations of the threonines within these motifs decrease the thermal hysteresis activity of the AFPs (15Graether S.P. Kuiper M.J. Gagné S.M. Walker V.K. Jia Z. Sykes B.D.

https://openalex.org/W2088009827,"Caryophyllaceae-type cyclic peptides (CPs) of 5-12 proteinogenic amino acids occur in 10 plant families. In Saponaria vaccaria (Caryophyllaceae), they have been shown to be formed from linear peptide precursors derived from ribosomal translation. There is also evidence for such precursors in other members of the Caryophyllaceae, Rutaceae, and Linaceae families. The biosynthesis of CP in the developing seeds of S. vaccaria was investigated with respect to the enzymes involved in precursor processing. Through biochemical assays with seed extracts and synthetic peptides, an enzyme named oligopeptidase 1 (OLP1) was found that catalyzes the cleavage of intermediates at the N terminus of the incipient CP. A second enzyme, peptide cyclase 1 (PCY1), which was separated chromatographically from OLP1, was found to act on the product of OLP1, giving rise to a cyclic peptide and concomitant removal of a C-terminal flanking sequence. PCY1 was partially purified, and using the methods of proteomics, a full-length cDNA clone encoding an enzyme matching the properties of PCY1 was obtained. The substrate specificity of purified recombinant PCY1, believed to be the first cloned plant enzyme whose function is peptide cyclization, was tested with synthetic peptides. The results are discussed in the light of CP biosynthetic systems of other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2052483400,"The mechanisms through which cell-cycle control and cell-fate decisions are coordinated in proliferating stem cell populations are largely unknown. Here, we show that E2f3 isoforms, which control cell-cycle progression in cooperation with the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), have critical effects during developmental and adult neurogenesis. Loss of either E2f3 isoform disrupts Sox2 gene regulation and the balance between precursor maintenance and differentiation in the developing cortex. Both isoforms target the Sox2 locus to maintain baseline levels of Sox2 expression but antagonistically regulate Sox2 levels to instruct fate choices. E2f3-mediated regulation of Sox2 and precursor cell fate extends to the adult brain, where E2f3a loss results in defects in hippocampal neurogenesis and memory formation. Our results demonstrate a mechanism by which E2f3a and E2f3b differentially regulate Sox2 dosage in neural precursors, a finding that may have broad implications for the regulation of diverse stem cell populations."
https://openalex.org/W2071117096,"α-L-rhamnosidases hydrolyze α-linked L-rhamnosides from oligosaccharides or polysaccharides. We determined the crystal structure of the glycoside hydrolase family 78 Streptomyces avermitilis α-L-rhamnosidase (SaRha78A) in its free and L-rhamnose complexed forms, which revealed the presence of six domains N, D, E, F, A, and C. In the ligand complex, L-rhamnose was bound in the proposed active site of the catalytic module, revealing the likely catalytic mechanism of SaRha78A. Glu(636) is predicted to donate protons to the glycosidic oxygen, and Glu(895) is the likely catalytic general base, activating the nucleophilic water, indicating that the enzyme operates through an inverting mechanism. Replacement of Glu(636) and Glu(895) resulted in significant loss of α-rhamnosidase activity. Domain D also bound L-rhamnose in a calcium-dependent manner, with a KD of 135 μm. Domain D is thus a non-catalytic carbohydrate binding module (designated SaCBM67). Mutagenesis and structural data identified the amino acids in SaCBM67 that target the features of L-rhamnose that distinguishes it from the other major sugars present in plant cell walls. Inactivation of SaCBM67 caused a substantial reduction in the activity of SaRha78A against the polysaccharide composite gum arabic, but not against aryl rhamnosides, indicating that SaCBM67 contributes to enzyme function against insoluble substrates."

One of the most important realizations from these approaches is that the functional output of genomes is affected by the nuclear environment in which they exist. Integration of sequence information with molecular and cellular features of the genome promises a fuller understanding of genome function. The recent ability to routinely probe genome function at a global scale has revolutionized our view of genomes. One of the most important realizations from these approaches is that the functional output of genomes is affected by the nuclear environment in which they exist. Integration of sequence information with molecular and cellular features of the genome promises a fuller understanding of genome function. It was a moment of scientific amazement in 1953 when Watson and Crick revealed the structure of DNA. The magnificence of the double helix and its elegant simplicity were awe inspiring. But more than just being beautiful, the double helix immediately paved the way forward; its structure implied fundamental biological processes such as semiconservative replication and the notion that chemical changes in its composition may alter heritable traits. The linear structure of DNA laid the foundation for the concept that a string of chemical entities could encode the information that determines the very essence of every living organism. The beauty of the double helix was the promise that, if the sequence of bases in the genome could be mapped and decoded, the genetic information that underlies all living organisms would be revealed and the secret of biological systems would be unlocked. The idea of linearly encoded genetic information has been spectacularly successful, culminating in the recent development of powerful high-throughput sequencing methods that now allow the routine reading of entire genomes. The conceptual elegance of the genome is that the information contained in the DNA sequence is absolute. The order of bases can be determined by sequencing, and the result is always unequivocal. The ability to decipher and accurately predict the behavior of genome sequences was appealing to the early molecular biologists, has given rise to the discipline of molecular genetics, and has catalyzed the reductionist thinking that has driven and dominated the field of molecular biology since its inception. But the apparent simplicity and deterministic nature of genomes can be deceptive. One of the most important lessons learned from our ability to exhaustively sequence DNA and to probe genome behavior at a global scale by mapping chromatin properties and expression profiling is that the sequence is only the first step in genome function. In intact living cells and organisms, the functional output of genomes is modulated, and the hard-wired information contained in the sequence is often amplified or suppressed. While mutations are an extreme case of genome modulation, most commonly occurring changes in genome function are more subtle and consist of fluctuations in gene expression, temporary silencing, or temporary activation of genes. Although not caused by mutations, these genome activity changes are functionally important. Several mechanisms modulate genome function (Figure 1). At the transcription level, the limited availability of components of the transcription machinery at specific sites in the genome influences the short-term behavior of genes and may make their expression stochastic. Epigenetic modifications are capable of overriding genetically encoded information via chemical modification of chromatin. Similarly, changes in higher-order chromatin organization and gene positioning within the nucleus alter functional properties of genome regions. The existence of mechanisms that modulate the output of genomes makes it clear that a true understanding of genome function requires integration of what we have learned about genome sequence with what we are still discovering about how genomes are modified and how they are organized in vivo in the cell nucleus. The genome is what defines an organism and an individual cell. It is therefore tempting to assume that identical genomes behave identically in a population of cells. We now know that this is not the case. Individual, genetically identical cells can behave very differently even in the same physiological environment. It is rare to find a truly homogeneous population of cells even under controlled laboratory conditions, as anyone who has tried to make a cell line stably expressing a transgene knows. Much of the variability in biological behavior between individual cells comes from stochastic activity of genes (Raj and van Oudenaarden, 2008Raj A. van Oudenaarden A. Nature, nurture, or chance: stochastic gene expression and its consequences.Cell. 2008; 135: 216-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Genes are by definition low-copy-number entities, as each typically only exists in two copies in the cell. Similarly, many transcription factors are present in relatively low numbers in the cell nucleus. The low copy number of genes and transcription factors makes gene expression inherently prone to stochastic effects (Raj and van Oudenaarden, 2008Raj A. van Oudenaarden A. Nature, nurture, or chance: stochastic gene expression and its consequences.Cell. 2008; 135: 216-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Numerous observations make it clear that gene expression is stochastic in vivo. For example, dose-dependent increases in gene expression after treatment of cell populations with stimulating ligands, such as hormones, are often brought about by high expression of target genes in a relatively small number of cells in the population rather than by a uniform increase in the activity in all cells. Stochastic gene behavior is most evident in single-cell imaging approaches, and mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization of multiple genes, which according to population-based PCR analysis are active in a given cell population, shows that only a few cells transcribe all “constitutively active” genes at any given time. Most cells only express a subset of genes, and the combinations vary considerably between individual cells. These observations suggest that many genes blink on and off and are expressed in bursts rather than in a continuous fashion (Larson et al., 2009Larson D.R. Singer R.H. Zenklusen D. A single molecule view of gene expression.Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 630-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for stochastic gene expression is unknown. There are several candidate mechanisms, all of which are related to genome or nuclear organization. Most genes require some degree of chromatin remodeling for activity, which is thought to make regulatory regions accessible to the transcription machinery. Several observations suggest that chromatin remodeling contributes to the stochastic bursting of gene expression. Maybe most compelling is the finding that genes located near each other on the same chromosome show correlated blinking behavior, indicating that a local chromosome property, such as chromatin structure, drives stochastic behavior (Becskei et al., 2005Becskei A. Kaufmann B.B. van Oudenaarden A. Contributions of low molecule number and chromosomal positioning to stochastic gene expression.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Furthermore, altering chromatin, for example by deletion of chromatin remodeling machinery, affects stochastic variability in yeast. It can be envisioned that the stochastic behavior of genes is caused by the requirement for cyclical opening of chromatin regions. Open chromatin has a limited persistence time, and maintaining chromatin in an open state requires the cyclical action of chromatin remodelers. Whether an “active” gene is transcribed at any given time may thus depend on the transient condensation status of its chromatin at a particular moment. A second mechanism to impose nonuniform stochastic genome activity may be the local availability of the transcription machinery at a gene. Although transcription factors are able to relatively freely diffuse through the nuclear space, and in this way effectively scan the genome for binding sites, their availability and functionality at a given local site may undergo significant temporal fluctuations (Misteli, 2001Misteli T. Protein dynamics: implications for nuclear architecture and gene expression.Science. 2001; 291: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The local availability of transcription complexes may affect transcription frequency positive or negatively. On the one hand, it is possible that relatively stable preinitiation complexes persist on a given gene, where they may support multiple rounds of transcription and in this way boost initiation frequency. On the other hand, assembly of the full polymerase is a stochastic and relatively inefficient event itself. In order for a functional polymerase complex to assemble, individual transcription machinery components associate with chromatin in a step-wise fashion, and formation of the mature polymerase complex involves multiple partially assembled intermediates, many of which are unstable and disintegrate before a functionally competent complex is formed (Misteli, 2001Misteli T. Protein dynamics: implications for nuclear architecture and gene expression.Science. 2001; 291: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The inefficiency of polymerase assembly may create stochasticity at an individual locus. A further contributor to stochastic gene expression may be the organization of transcription events in transcription factories. These hubs of transcription consist of accumulations of transcription factors to which multiple genes, often located on distinct chromosomes, are recruited (Edelman and Fraser, 2012Edelman L.B. Fraser P. Transcription factories: genetic programming in three dimensions.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2012; 22: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Typically only a few hundred such transcription factories are observed in a mammalian cell nucleus. It is possible that some genes need to physically relocate from nucleoplasmic locations to transcription factories. A nominally “active” gene locus that is not associated with a transcription factory may thus be stochastically silent. The relatively low number of transcription sites makes them a limiting factor in the transcription process and thus a potential mediator of stochastic gene expression. Stochastic effects modulate genome output on short timescales. A mechanism to modulate the hardwired information of genomes on longer timescales is via epigenetics. The Greek-derived “Epi” means “over” or “above,” and epigenetic effects are defined as heritable changes in genome activity caused by mechanisms other than changes in DNA sequence. Epigenetic events are mediated by chemical modifications of DNA or core histones in complex patterns by methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, phosphorylation, etc. These modifications alter gene expression by changing the chromatin surface and in this way affect the binding of regulatory factors. Well-established examples of such effects include binding of the DNA-methylation-dependent binding of the MeCP2 protein or the binding of PHD-domain-containing proteins to trimethylated histone H3 tails. Prominent biological effects based on epigenetic regulation are phenotypic differences between homozygous twins or imprinted genes that are expressed from only one allele in a diploid organism. A central tenet in the definition of epigenetic regulation is that its effects are heritable, i.e., transmittable over generations. In fact, the concept of epigenetics was inspired by epidemiological findings that nutrient availability in preadolescents during the 19th century Swedish famine determined life expectance of their grandchildren. The epidemiological studies have recently been complemented by controlled laboratory studies in mice (Rando, 2012Rando O.J. Daddy issues: paternal effects on phenotype.Cell. 2012; 151: 702-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and they have been extended to the molecular level by the findings that loss of the histone H3K4-trimethylation prolongs lifespan in C. elegans in a heritable fashion for several generations (Greer et al., 2011Greer E.L. Maures T.J. Ucar D. Hauswirth A.G. Mancini E. Lim J.P. Benayoun B.A. Shi Y. Brunet A. Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2011; 479: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). A complicating aspect of epigenetics is that the same modifications that mediate heritable epigenetic regulation may also bring about nonheritable transient modulations of the genome. In fact, the term “epigenetic” is nowadays often used in a very cavalier manner to refer to any biological effect, heritable or not, that is affected by histone modifications. Even if they are not heritable, histone modifications are biologically relevant modulators of genome function. The system of histone modifications is in many ways akin to the mechanisms by which signal transduction pathways work (Schreiber and Bernstein, 2002Schreiber S.L. Bernstein B.E. Signaling network model of chromatin.Cell. 2002; 111: 771-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Just as in signal transduction pathways, posttranslational modifications on histone tails create binding sites that are then recognized by adaptor or reader proteins, which in turn elicit downstream effects such as activation of kinases in the case of signaling cascades or recruitment of transcription factors in the case of histone modifications. In further analogy to the reversible events in signaling pathways, histone modifications can be altered or erased by modifying enzymes. Such transient and reversible modulatory effects of histone modifications have been implicated in every step of gene expression, starting from chromatin remodeling to recruitment of transcription machinery and even to downstream events that were thought to be chromatin independent, such as alternative pre-mRNA splicing (Luco et al., 2011Luco R.F. Allo M. Schor I.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Misteli T. Epigenetics in alternative pre-mRNA splicing.Cell. 2011; 144: 16-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). It is often difficult to determine heritability of these histone modification effects, and it therefore remains unclear how many of them are truly epigenetic. Regardless, DNA and histone modifications are an obvious source of modulation of the information contained in the genome sequence. Genomes of course do not exist as linear, naked DNA in the cell nucleus but are organized into higher-order chromatin fibers, chromatin domains, and chromosomes. Many correlations between genome organization and activity have been made—most prominently, the findings that transcriptionally active genes are generally located in decondensed chromatin and that transcriptionally repressed genome regions are often found at the nuclear periphery. These observations point to the possibility that the spatial organization of the genome modulates its functional output. But in considering the relationship of genome structure with its function, we are faced with a perpetual chicken-and-egg problem. Does structure drive function, or is structure merely a reflection of function? Much of the thinking on this topic has been guided by observations on individual genes. How representative these were for the genome as a whole has been a confounding concern. Recent unbiased genome-wide analysis of structure/function relationships has validated the tight link between structure and function. Large-scale analysis of chromatin structure, histone modifications, and expression profiles shows that genomes are portioned into well-defined domains that closely correlate with their activity status and the presence of active or repressive histone marks (Sexton et al., 2012Sexton T. Yaffe E. Kenigsberg E. Bantignies F. Leblanc B. Hoichman M. Parrinello H. Tanay A. Cavalli G. Three-dimensional folding and functional organization principles of the Drosophila genome.Cell. 2012; 148: 458-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). The domains are separated by sharp boundaries marked by particular histone modification patterns and binding sites for chromatin insulator proteins such as CTCF. Even stronger evidence comes from the analysis of physical interactions between chromatin domains. At least in fruit flies, functionally equivalent domains tend to preferentially interact; that is, domains containing silent regions cluster in three-dimensional space, as do domains containing active regions (Sexton et al., 2012Sexton T. Yaffe E. Kenigsberg E. Bantignies F. Leblanc B. Hoichman M. Parrinello H. Tanay A. Cavalli G. Three-dimensional folding and functional organization principles of the Drosophila genome.Cell. 2012; 148: 458-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). But can genome structure drive its function? The best example for structure-mediated gene expression effects is the silencing of genes when they become juxtaposed to heterochromatin domains, be it in the nuclear interior or at the nuclear periphery (Beisel and Paro, 2011Beisel C. Paro R. Silencing chromatin: comparing modes and mechanisms.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Gene activity has also frequently been linked to the position of a gene within the cell nucleus. The strongest evidence for such a relationship is experiments in which genes are transplanted from the nuclear interior to the lamina, leading to their repression or making them refractory to activation (Geyer et al., 2011Geyer P.K. Vitalini M.W. Wallrath L.L. Nuclear organization: taking a position on gene expression.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2011; 23: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Based on these and similar experiments, it is often quite categorically stated that active genome regions are found in the interior of the nucleus and inactive ones at the periphery. This is a somewhat misleading oversimplification. Although lamina-associated genome regions are generally gene poor and are not transcribed, transcription labeling experiments reveal numerous active transcription sites at the periphery, and genes that are near the periphery, but not physically associated with it, are often active. On the other hand, inactive genes are frequently found in the interior. As far as we can tell, nuclear position per se does not determine activity, but association with repressive regions of the nucleus, be it at the periphery or the interior, does. So, how then should we think about the chicken-and-egg problem of nuclear structure and function? How can it be that clear evidence exists for both “function-driving-structure” as well for “structure-driving-function”? The likely answer is that both effects are at play and are part of an overarching principle in which the mutual interplay of structure and function at multiple levels influences gene expression. The fact that there are very few known heterochromatic active genes suggests that a structural change in the form of chromatin decondensation is a crucial early step in gene activation. However, because chromatin states are generally unstable, mechanisms that reinforce a decondensed chromatin state must be in force for a gene to remain active. Such reinforcing mechanisms are dependent on gene activity and represent the “activity-drives-function” aspect of gene expression. Reinforcement mechanisms might be mediated by what we consider “active” histone modifications, some of which are known to be deposited during transcription as the polymerases traverse genes. On the flipside, a chromatin domain may also impose its effect on neighboring regions, either in cis on the same chromosome by spreading or in trans on distinct chromosomes. This effect represents the “structure-drives-function” aspect of genome function. Such a bidirectional, self-enforcing function-structure-function model accounts for most experimental observations on structure-function relationships in gene expression. Since the discovery of the double helix, we have come to realize that understanding genomes requires more than reading their sequence and that the information contained in the sequence is modulated by the cellular environment. How then do we gain full knowledge of the functional information encoded in genomes? To get a comprehensive picture of the functional output of genomes, the sequence information needs to be integrated with other information parameters such as epigenetic patterns, higher-order chromatin landscapes, and noncoding RNA profiles. The technology to do this is now available, and intense efforts are currently underway to comprehensively gather these data sets in various biological systems. The first examples of such multilevel mapping analyses are emerging, such as the recent flurry of reports from the ENCODE consortium, which has systematically mapped genome properties ranging from histone modification profiles to regulatory elements and chromatin structure (Ecker et al., 2012Ecker J.R. Bickmore W.A. Barroso I. Pritchard J.K. Gilad Y. Segal E. Genomics: ENCODE explained.Nature. 2012; 489: 52-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Given the scale and complexity of the generated data, not to mention the technical difficulties in gathering it, this is a challenging undertaking that will require a series of progressively larger studies. Ideally, future studies should be designed to systematically map multiple genome properties for focused biological systems such as specific human diseases. Large-scale mapping of genome-related parameters and their comparison is a logical and necessary next step in the exploration of genomes and their function. These efforts will create invaluable catalogs of genome properties, and the hope is that, by cross-comparing data sets, insight into the rules that govern genome regulation will be gleaned. One can go one step further and advocate for an even more comprehensive approach in which genome expression data are then compared to other cellular characteristics such as proteomic, metabolomic, morphological, and physiological data to systematically link genome activity to biological behavior. The ultimate version of such an approach was recently described in a report by the US National Academies of Sciences entitled “Toward Precision Medicine,” which envisioned a fully minable biomedical data repository that would include information ranging from genomic and epigenetic parameters to physiological features and clinical symptoms. The elegant simplicity of the DNA structure revealed by Watson and Crick is still stunning. True to its promise when it was first discovered, it opened up the floodgates to understanding heredity. But one of the most profound lessons from the ensuing decades of genome exploration must be that the linear arrangement of bases in the DNA is not an absolute set of instructions but is malleable by the cellular environment. We are just beginning to uncover some of the mechanisms that are responsible for these effects. As is the rule in biology, wherein the whole is often greater than the sum of its parts, we are realizing that the genome is far more complex than the sequence of its DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2057113150,"The equilibrium state of CCR5 is manipulated here toward either activation or inactivation by introduction of single amino acid substitutions in the transmembrane domains (TMs) 6 and 7. Insertion of a steric hindrance mutation in the center of TM7 (G286F in position VII:09/7.42) resulted in biased signaling. Thus, β-arrestin recruitment was eliminated, whereas constitutive activity was observed in Gαi-mediated signaling. Furthermore, the CCR5 antagonist aplaviroc was converted to a full agonist (a so-called efficacy switch). Computational modeling revealed that the position of the 7TM receptor-conserved Trp in TM6 (Trp-248 in position VI:13/6.48, part of the CWXP motif) was influenced by the G286F mutation, causing Trp-248 to change orientation away from TM7. The essential role of Trp-248 in CCR5 activation was supported by complete inactivity of W248A-CCR5 despite maintaining chemokine binding. Furthermore, replacing Trp-248 with a smaller aromatic amino acid (Tyr/Phe) impaired the β-arrestin recruitment, yet with maintained G protein activity (biased signaling); also, here aplaviroc switched to a full agonist. Thus, the altered positioning of Trp-248, induced by G286F, led to a constraint of G protein active, but β-arrestin inactive and thus biased, CCR5 conformation. These results provide important information on the molecular interplay and impact of TM6 and TM7 for CCR5 activity, which may be extrapolated to other chemokine receptors and possibly to other 7TM receptors."

However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. PARP1 is a ubiquitous multifunctional nuclear enzyme. In this study, we examined the interplay between PARP1 and ERα, and identified PARP1 as an important regulator of ERα-dependent transcription. We showed that PARP1 could directly bind to ERα, and ERα could be poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated by PARP1. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation increased ERα binding to estrogen response element (ERE) present in the promoter of target genes and promoted ERα-mediated gene transcription.

Upon treatment with estradiol, ERα binding to ERE- and ERα-dependent gene expression was dramatically increased in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Inhibition of PARP1 by PARP inhibitor or PARP1 siRNA decreased ERα binding to ERE and prevented ERα-dependent gene transcription in VSMCs.

These receptors play crucial roles in multiple aspects of animal physiology, ranging from development and differentiation to metabolic homeostasis (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P.

The nuclear receptor superfamily: the second decade.Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6064) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrate that the regulation of gene transcription by nuclear receptors is mainly due to the realization that not only the interaction of the receptors with DNA, but also that many transcription co-regulators (including both co-activators and co-repressors), which were crucial in transmitting the signals to the transcriptional machinery of the receptors (2Smirnov A.N. Nuclear receptors: nomenclature, ligands, mechanisms of their effects on gene expression.Biochemistry. 2002; 67: 957-977PubMed Google Scholar). Estrogen receptor α (ERα, UniProt ID: P06211), known as NR3A1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group A, member 1), is a member of the steroid nuclear receptor family. In the unliganded state, ERα recruits the co-repressor complexes in association with histone deacetylases to silence target genes (3Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. The coregulator exchange in transcriptional functions of nuclear receptors.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of the natural ligand of ERs, sex hormone estradiol, ERα undergoes a conformational change that dislodges the co-repressor complexes, exposing a “docking” site for co-activators, then modulates the expression of ERα target genes via directly binding to the specific response elements known as estrogen response element (ERE) (3Glass C.K.

In the present study, we found that PARP1 could bind to and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ate ERα. In cultured rat VSMCs, inhibition of PARP1 inhibited ERα binding to ERE and decreased ERα-dependent target gene expression. Treatment with estradiol increased poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of ERα, and thereafter promoted ERα transactivation. Thus we identified PARP1 as a key regulator of ERα-mediated transcription. Rat aortic VSMCs were isolated from thoracic aorta in male Wistar rats (150–180 g, obtained from Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China) by a tissue adherent method described previously. Freshly isolated thoracic aorta was clipped into small slices and then planted in the culture flask. After about 1 week, the primary VSMCs were digested by 0.5% trypsin, and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) without phenol red and with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The purity of the VSMCs was evaluated by staining the cells with monoclonal antibodies to smooth muscle cell α-actin. More than 96% of cells expressed smooth muscle cell α-actin. Experiments were performed on cells at 3 to 10 passages after primary culture. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were routinely maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The full-length cDNA of human PARP1 was cloned by RT-PCR from 293 cells. The fragments of PARP1 A (aa1–214), B (aa215–372), C (aa373–476), D (aa477–524), E (aa525–656), and F (aa657–1014) were constructed in the mammalian expression vector p3flag-CMV (Sigma-Aldrich). Human cDNAs encoding ERα was cloned by RT-PCR from 293 cells. The expression plasmids for GFP-tagged ERα A (aa1–184), B (aa185–310), C (aa311–595) were constructed by inserting PCR fragments from ERα cDNA into the pcDNA3.1-GFP vector. A catalytically inactive mutant of PARP1 (mut-PARP1), in which lysine 893 was substituted by isoleucine (K893I), was generated as previously by using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) (19Simonin F.

Transfections were performed in triplicate for each treatment. 6 h later, after several washes in PBS, one part was prepared for flow cytometric analyses. The others were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min in the dark, and washed again with PBS. The cover slips were mounted with PBS/glycerin. Cells were photographed under a light or fluorescence microscope (for Cy3, wavelength 555 nm, Olympus Microscope BX-51, Japan). Methods for preparation of whole cell extracts and nuclear extracts were described previously (22Zaniolo K. Desnoyers S. Leclerc S. Guérin S.L. Regulation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) gene expression through the post-translational modification of Sp1: a nuclear target protein of PARP-1.BMC Mol.

The BRCT domain of PARP-1 is required for immunoglobulin gene conversion.PLoS Biol. 2010; 8: e1000428Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These whole cell and nuclear extracts were stored at −80 °C until use. Protein concentrations of these extracts were determined by the Bradford assay. PARP activity was assayed using the universal colorimetric PARP assay kit (Trevigen), based on the incorporation of biotinylated ADP-ribose onto histone proteins. Cell lysates containing 50 μg of protein were loaded into a 96-well plate coated with histones and biotinylated poly ADP-ribose, allowed to incubate for 1 h, treated with strep-HRP, and read at 450 nm in a spectrophotometer. After denaturation and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mmol/liter NaCl) for 3 h, and incubated with primary antibodies in TBS at 4 °C overnight. Antibodies used were anti-PARP1 (1:1000, R&D), anti-PAR (1:1000, Trevigen), anti-ERα (1:1000, Millipore), anti-hist1 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-actin (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-GAPDH (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in TBS at room temperature for 2 h. The specific band was detected with a chemiluminescence assay (ECL detection reagents, Pierce) and recorded on x-ray film. Quantity One software was used to quantify the intensities of bands. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Takara Biotechnology, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instruction. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the RNA PCR kit (Takara Biotechnology, Japan), and the resulting cDNA was used as a PCR template. The mRNA levels were determined by real-time PCR with the ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detector system (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GAPDH was used as an endogenous control. The PCR reaction mixture contained the SYBR Green I (Takara Biotechnology), cDNA and the primers. The relative gene expression level (the amount of target, normalized to endogenous control gene) was calculated using the comparative Ct method formula 2−ΔΔCt. Rat primers were as follows: GAPDH: 5′-ATGACTCTACCCACGGCAAG-3′ and 5′-TACTCAGCACCAGCATCACC-3′; TGF-α 5′-CCTGGCTGTCCTCATTATCACCT-3′ and 5′-AGCAGGCAGTCCTTCCTTTCAG-3′; cyclin D1: 5′-GAGGAGCAGAAGTGCGAAGAGG-3′ and 5′-GGCGGATAGAGTTGTCAGT GTAGATG-3′; IGF-1: 5′-CTTTTACTTCAACAAGCCCACAGG-3′ and 5′-GCACAGTACATCTCCAGCCTCCT-3′. Far-Western blot assays were performed by resolving protein samples by SDS-PAGE and transferring them to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Membranes were then incubated with Hyb-75 buffer (20 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.6, 75 mmol/liter KCl, 0.1 mmol/liter EDTA, 2.5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.005% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmol/liter DTT) supplemented with 5% nonfat milk, overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were briefly washed with Hyb-75 buffer and then incubated with 1 μg/ml recombinant protein (PARP1 (Trevigen), ERα (Millipore), or β-actin (Abnova), respectively) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with Hyb-75 buffer, membranes were incubated with anti-PARP1 antibody or anti-ERα antibody at 4 °C overnight. After washing, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h. Specific bands were detected using the ECL detection system (Pierce). Co-IP assays were performed as described previously. Briefly, 500 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with the indicated antibodies at 4 °C for 1 h, and protein-G-agarose at 4 °C for 12 h. Immunoprecipitates were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 1 min and washed four times with lysis buffer. The pellets were suspended in SDS gel loading buffer, boiled for 10 min, and subjected to Western blot analysis. To determine the specificity of the bands, nonspecific IgG (negative control) was used. DNA-protein interaction was detected using LightShiftTM Chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequence of ERE consensus oligonucleotides was: 5′-CTTCGAGGAGGTCACAGTGACCTG GAGCGG-3′. Biotin was labeled at the 5′-end of the oligonucleotides. In the supershift assay, after incubation of nuclear extracts with anti-PAR, anti-PARP1 antibody, anti-ERα antibody, or nonspecific IgG at 4 °C for 30 min, biotin-labeled oligonucleotides were added to the reaction and incubated for another 20 min. ChIP experiments were performed as previously described (20Xu W. Cho H. Evans R.M. Acetylation and methylation in nuclear receptor gene activation.Methods Enzymol. 2003; 364: 205-223PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were sonicated, and lysates were immunoprecipitated using the anti-ERα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In re-ChIP assays, chromatin was first immunoprecipitated with anti-ERα antibody and then eluted with 100 μl of elution buffer with 10 mmol/liter DTT at 37 °C for 30 min and then, diluted (25-fold) with dilution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100), and re-immunoprecipitated with IgG or anti-PAR antibody. Real-time-PCR was performed using 1 μg of template DNA with specific primers for rat IGF-1. Sequence of the primer is available upon request. The chromosomal DNA input and ChIP DNA with nonspecific IgG were subjected to the same PCR amplification. PCR products were separated on an ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gel. A Southwestern blot was performed according to the procedure of Butler and Ordahl (18Butler A.J. Ordahl C.P. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase binds with transcription enhancer factor 1 to MCAT1 elements to regulate muscle-specific transcription.Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Nuclear proteins (35 μg) were resolved on a 9% SDS-PAGE and then electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% BLOTTO-0.1% bovine serum albumin-1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC) in binding buffer (30 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mm dithiothreitol), followed by incubation with 1.0 pmol biotin-labeled ERE oligonucleotides in Hyb-50 buffer (30 mmol/ liter HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mmol/liter KCl, 10 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter DTT, 5% BLOTTO, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)) at 4 °C overnight. After washed three times (30 mmol/liter HEPES (pH7.6), 50 mmol/liter NaCl, 1% BLOTTO), membranes were incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate in blocking buffer (Pierce) for 15 min. Specific binding was detected with ECL detection reagents (Pierce), and band intensities were quantified as described above. The luciferase-reporter plasmid ERE-TK-LUC was kindly provided by Dr. Ming-Jer Tsai (Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine).1 μg of ERE-TK-LUC and 10 ng of pRL-SV40 plasmids (internal control for normalization of transfection efficiency, Promega) were transfected into VSMCs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instruction. After incubation for 24 h, cells were harvested, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activity with the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Values are shown as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. The significance of differences was estimated by one-way ANOVA followed by Student-Newmann-Keuls multiple comparison tests. p < 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software (version 11.0, SPSS Inc). We used rat VSMCs and examined whether PARP1 is directly involved in the modulation of ERα target genes. We found that treatment of VSMCs with PARP inhibitor, 3-aminobenzamide (3AB) or N-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl)-2-(N,N-dimethylamino)acetamide (PJ34), or knockdown of PARP1 by specific siRNA significantly decreased mRNA expression of ERα target genes including cyclin D1 (UniProt ID: Q99NB4), insulin-like growth factors-1 (IGF-1, UniProt ID: P08025), and transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α, UniProt ID: P01134) (Fig. 1, A and B). Estradiol, the ligand of ERα, significantly increased mRNA expression of the above mentioned genes, which was inhibited by PARP inhibitor or PARP1 siRNA in VSMCs (Fig. 1, A and B). To confirm the estrogen regulation of these genes, we used an antiestrogen ICI 182,780 (ICI). Results showed that treatment with ICI abrogated the estradiol-induced increases in the expression of cyclin D1, IGF-1, and TGF-α (Fig. 1C). All these results suggested that PARP1 was involved in the regulation of ERα-mediated transcriptional activation. In the nucleus, ERα directly binds to ERE in the promoter of target genes to regulate their transcription. To explore the influence of PARP1 on ERα-dependent transcriptional responses, ERE-driven luciferase reporter (ERE-TK-LUC) was constructed. Treatment with estradiol increased ERE-dependent luciferase reporter activity in VSMCs. Inhibition of PARP activity by 3AB or PJ34, or knockdown of PARP1 by siRNA decreased transcriptional output of the ERE-driven luciferase reporter under either basal or estradiol-treated condition (Fig. 1, D and E), indicating that inhibition of PARP1 prevented ERα transactivation. These results also illustrated that activation of PARP1 was critical for estradiol-induced ERα transactivation in VSMCs. The finding that PARP1 might regulate ERα-mediated transcriptional activation led us to explore the interaction between PARP1 and ERα in detail. First, we examined whether PARP1 bound to ERα directly. Far Western blot assay showed that both un-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP1 (UP-PARP1) and auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP1 (AP-PARP1) could specifically bind to the 67-kDa protein in nuclear extracts from VSMCs (Fig. 2A). Since ERα was a 67-kDa nuclear protein, this protein was speculated to be ERα. In line with this speculation, both UP-PARP1 and AP-PARP1 failed to bind to the 67 kDa nuclear protein in ERα-knockdown VSMCs (Fig. 2A). To further determine if PARP1 and ERα were in the same nuclear complex in VSMCs, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiment. Endogenous PARP1 of VSMCs was immunoprecipitated by anti-PARP1 antibody followed by Western blot assay using anti-ERα antibody. Results showed that PARP1 was co-precipitated with ERα (Fig 2Bi) and vice versa (Fig 2Bii). In a cell-free system, we also found that recombinant ERα could specifically bind to recombinant UP-PARP1 and AP-PARP1, respectively (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrated that PARP1 could directly interact with ERα. To further investigate which domain of ERα-mediated protein-protein interaction with PARP1, we used the ERα deletion mutants. We then observed that endogenous PARP1 associated specifically with the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of ERα (Fig. 2D). Using PARP1 deletion mutants, we localized the ERα-binding site to the central BRCA1 C terminus (BRCT)/auto-modification domain (AMD) of PARP1 (Fig. 2E). Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is an important post-transcriptional modification of proteins. We then detected whether or not ERα was poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated in VSMCs using IP assay with the antibody specific for poly(ADP-ribose) polymer (PAR). Western blot assay revealed that ERα was poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated (Fig. 2Bi). Knockdown of PARP1 by siRNA dramatically decreased the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of ERα in VSMCs, indicating that ERα was poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated by PARP1 (Fig. 3A). To investigate the role of the enzymatic activity of PARP1 in mediating ERα poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, we used recombinant proteins in a cell-free system. Incubation of recombinant ERα protein with recombinant PARP1 protein, NAD+ and active DNA led to strong poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of ERα; however, addition of 3AB prevented poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of ERα (Fig. 3B). The evidence established that ERα was poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated by PARP1. IP assay with antibody specific for ERα was then carried out. Western blot assay with anti-PAR antibody revealed that estradiol treatment increased the amount of eluted poly(ADP-ribosy)lated ERα in the dose-dependent manner, while knockdown of PARP1 by siRNA abogated the eluted poly(ADP-ribosy)lated ERα (Fig. 3C), suggesting that estradiol promoted PARP1 activation and ERα poly(ADP-ribosy)lation. In line with this result, treatment with estradiol increased enzymatic activity of PARP in the dose-dependent manner in VSMCs (Fig. 3D). ERα can directly bind to ERE in the promoter of target gene, and the classical pathway for ERα signaling is mediated by ERα binding to ERE (21Glidewell-Kenney C. Weiss J. Lee E.J. Pillai S. Ishikawa T. Ariazi E.A. Jameson J.L. ERE-independent ERα target genes differentially expressed in human breast tumors.Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2005; 245: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To investigate the influence of PARP1 on ERα-ERE formation, we performed EMSA and Southwestern blot assays. Results showed that inhibition of PARP activity by 3AB or PJ34 prevented the binding of ERα to ERE in VSMCs (Fig. 4, Ai and B). Estradiol, which promoted PARP1 activation, increased ERα binding to ERE; and treatment of VSMCs with PARP inhibitor prevented this increase (Fig. 4, Aii and B). These results suggested that the activation of PARP1 promoted ERα-ERE complex formation. Thereby, the direct influence of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation on the binding of ERα to ERE was investigated. The EMSA assay showed that incubation of nuclear extracts from non-treated VSMCs with NAD+ and active DNA increased ERα-ERE complex formation; while this increase was inhibited by co-incubation with 3AB (Fig. 4C). Similar results were obtained in a cell-free system using recombinant proteins (Fig. 4D). All the data indicated that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation increased ERα binding to ERE. In line with this finding, a supershift assay showed that incubation of nuclear extracts with anti-PAR antibody could abrogate the band of ERα-ERE complex, while incubation with IgG failed to abrogate or shift the band of the ERα-ERE complex (Fig. 4E). The nuclear accumulation of ERα also influenced the ERα-ERE complex formation in the nucleus; we thus analyzed the nuclear expression of ERα in VSMCs using Western blot assay. We found that treatment with estradiol resulted in the increased nuclear accumulation of ERα, while inhibition of PARP1 did not influence its nuclear accumulation in cells treated with or without estradiol (Fig. 4, F and G). We further examined the influence of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation on the recruitment of ERα to the promoter of IGF-1, a target gene of ERα, by ChIP assays.

https://openalex.org/W2090956941,"Uncontrolled activation of the alternative complement pathway (AP) is thought to be associated with age-related macular degeneration. Previously, we have shown that in retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) monolayers, oxidative stress reduced complement inhibition on the cell surface, resulting in sublytic complement activation and loss of transepithelial resistance (TER), but the potential ligand and pathway involved are unknown. ARPE-19 cells were grown as monolayers on transwell plates, and sublytic complement activation was induced with H2O2 and normal human serum. TER deteriorated rapidly in H2O2-exposed monolayers upon adding normal human serum. Although the effect required AP activation, AP was not sufficient, because elimination of MASP, but not C1q, prevented TER reduction. Reconstitution experiments to unravel essential components of the lectin pathway (LP) showed that both ficolin and mannan-binding lectin can activate the LP through natural IgM antibodies (IgM-C2) that recognize phospholipid cell surface modifications on oxidatively stressed RPE cells. The same epitopes were found on human primary embryonic RPE monolayers. Likewise, mouse laser-induced choroidal neovascularization, an injury that involves LP activation, could be increased in antibody-deficient rag1(-/-) mice using the phospholipid-specific IgM-C2. In summary, using a combination of depletion and reconstitution strategies, we have shown that the LP is required to initiate the complement cascade following natural antibody recognition of neoepitopes, which is then further amplified by the AP. LP activation is triggered by IgM bound to phospholipids. Taken together, we have defined novel mechanisms of complement activation in oxidatively stressed RPE, linking molecular events involved in age-related macular degeneration, including the presence of natural antibodies and neoepitopes."

Static and dynamic bone histomorphometric analyses revealed that Prkaa1−/− mice had an elevated rate of bone remodeling because of increases in bone formation and resorption, whereas AMPKα2 KO-induced bone mass reduction was largely attributable to elevated bone resorption. In agreement with our in vivo results, AMPKα deficiency was associated with increased osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Moreover, we found that AMPKα1 inhibited the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK) signaling, providing an explanation for AMPK-mediated inhibition of osteoclastogenesis.

The mammalian genome has seven genes that encode various isoforms of all three subunits (α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1, γ2, and γ3) that can form twelve different AMPK holoenzymes (1Kemp B.E. Mitchelhill K.I.

AMPK is activated by a number of physiological conditions that increase the ratio of AMP to ATP including glucose deprivation and hypoxia, as well as by nucleotide-independent stimuli. Phosphorylation at Thr-172 within the activation loop of the kinase domain of the α subunit is a prerequisite for AMPK activation (5Ingebritsen T.S. Lee H.S. Parker R.A. Gibson D.M. Reversible modulation of the activities of both liver microsomal hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and its inactivating enzyme. Evidence for regulation by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 1268-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The activated AMPK phosphorylates various downstream substrates and leads to either activation or inhibition of those downstream targets. The net effect is the inhibition of energy (e.g., ATP)-consuming cellular processes and stimulation of energy-producing processes. This mechanism is conserved from unicellular to complex multicellular organisms. Therefore, along with the notion that AMPK is present ubiquitously in various tissues, AMPK is also recognized as a key regulator of metabolism for whole body energy homeostasis. Great endeavors have been made to elucidate the functions and regulation of AMPK in the past decade. The current prevailing view is that AMPK is implicated in many fundamental biological processes by integrating both intracellular and extracellular signals, including growth factors, cytokines, hormones, nutrients, and cellular stress. Accordingly, clinical drugs and experimental therapeutic candidates that directly or indirectly modulate the AMPK-dependent intracellular signaling pathways have garnered particular attention for the treatment of metabolic syndromes. adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase receptor activator of nuclear factor κB aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide microcomputed tomography tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase bone volume per tissue volume macrophage-colony stimulating factor receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand bone marrow-derived macrophage carbonic anhydrase 2 inhibitor of κB kinase acetyl-CoA carboxylase.

The definite function of AMPK remains to be established in bone despite several studies in vitro and in vivo (12Jeyabalan J. Shah M. Viollet B. Chenu C. AMP-activated protein kinase pathway and bone metabolism.J. Endocrinol. 2012; 212: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, most of the studies on the role of AMPK in bone are largely explained by way of AMPK function in osteoblasts. Interestingly, there has been contradictory evidence among published results regarding AMPK regulation of osteoblast differentiation. A study in primary osteoblasts and MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells found that phosphorylation of AMPK is significantly decreased during osteoblastic differentiation and that matrix mineralization is significantly inhibited by activated AMPK (13Kasai T.

AMP kinase acts as a negative regulator of RANKL in the differentiation of osteoclasts.Bone. 2010; 47: 926-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Here, we sought to perform a more comprehensive characterization of the role of AMPK in bone maintenance by studying mice lacking each isoform of the AMPK catalytic subunits. We found that AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 are negative regulators of bone mass and osteoclastogenesis. We also showed that AMPKα1 inhibited RANK signaling in osteoclast precursors. Therefore, our study provides further insight into the role of AMPK in the regulation of bone metabolism, which may facilitate AMPK-based therapeutic interventions for bone disorders related to metabolic diseases. All of the mice were housed in a temperature controlled room with a light/dark cycle of 12 h. All of the mice had free access to sterilized water and were fed standard laboratory chow ad libitum at the Yale University Animal Care Facilities in accordance with approved procedures.

Prkaa1−/− mice and Prkaa2−/− mice were generated from the intercross of Prkaa1+/− and Prkaa2+/− mice, respectively. Genotyping of mice was performed at 3 weeks of age by PCR using tail genomic DNA as templates. All of the experiments were performed according to the protocol approved by Yale University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Bone samples for ex vivo measurements were collected from 3-month-old male mice. For dynamic histomorphometry, all of the subject animals were administered 30 mg of calcein/kg of body weight via intraperitoneal injections 7 and 2 days prior to euthanasia. The mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation. Long bones (femurs and tibiae) were collected, cleaned free of soft tissues, and fixed in 70% ethanol. The right femurs were used for measurements with microcomputed tomography (μCT) and then processed for methylmethacrylate embedding for histological staining and subsequent histomorphometry. For assessment of osteoclasts in vivo, the tibiae were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde mixed with 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 1× PBS for an hour followed by decalcification in 10% EDTA for 6 days at 4 °C. The decalcified bones were rinsed with 1× PBS three times for 5 min each and postfixed in cold 70% ethanol and processed for paraffin embedding. 5-μm-thick sections were deparaffinized and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) (24Khaliulin I. Clarke S.J. Lin H. Parker J. Suleiman M.S. Halestrap A.P. Temperature preconditioning of isolated rat hearts.

Femur morphometry was quantified using cone beam microfocus x-ray computed tomography (μCT40; Scanco Medical AG, Bassersdorf, Switzerland) as described previously (25Liu F. Lee S.K. Adams D.J. Gronowicz G.A. Kream B.E. CREM deficiency in mice alters the response of bone to intermittent parathyroid hormone treatment.Bone. 2007; 40: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Serial tomographic images were acquired, and three-dimensional images were reconstructed and used to determine the parameters. Trabecular morphometry was characterized by measuring the bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular thickness, trabecular number, and trabecular separation. Cortical measurements included average cortical thickness, cross-sectional area of cortical bone, subperiosteal cross-sectional area, and marrow area. Fixed tibiae were embedded in methylmethacrylate resin as described previously (26Merrell G.A. Troiano N.W. Coady C.E. Kacena M.A. Effects of long-term fixation on histological quality of undecalcified murine bones embedded in methylmethacrylate.Biotech. Histochem. 2005; 80: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and 5-μm-thick longitudinal sections were obtained using a rotation microtome (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). The sections were deplasticized and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue. Thick sections (10 μm) were also cut and left unstained for dynamic histomorphometry with epifluorescence imaging of calcein labels. Histomorphometric analysis of proximal tibial metaphysis was performed using the Osteomeasure system (OsteoMetrics Inc., Atlanta, GA) interfaced with an Olympus light/epifluorescent microscope and video subsystem. The region of interest in the proximal tibial metaphysis started ∼0.2 mm distal from the growth plate to exclude the primary spongiosa. All of the histomorphometric parameters described in this study followed the guidelines described in the Report of the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research Committee (27Parfitt A.M Drezner M.K.

Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were used as osteoclast progenitors (28Suda T. Jimi E. Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Role of 1 α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in osteoclast differentiation and function.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation and long bones (femurs, tibiae, and humeri) were aseptically removed and dissected free of soft tissues. The bone ends were cut, and the marrow cavity was flushed via slow injection of α-MEM using a 27-gauge needle. The cell suspension was sieved through a cell strainer (70 μm). The cells (2 × 107 cells/100-mm tissue culture dish) were then incubated in medium (α-MEM, 10% FBS (Gemini Bio-Products West Sacramento, CA), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) for 12–18 h to remove adherent cells. The nonadherent cells were then harvested, replated (1.5 × 107 cells/100-mm tissue culture dish), and cultured for 3 days in the presence of 1/10 volume of L929 conditioned medium, which was used as a source of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (29Burgess A.W. Metcalf D. Kozka I.J. Simpson R.J. Vairo G. Hamilton J.A. Nice E.C. Purification of two forms of colony-stimulating factor from mouse L-cell-conditioned medium.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16004-16011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To harvest BMMs, the cells were rinsed with cold 1× PBS to remove floating cells (including dead cells) and incubated in cold 1× PBS (Ca2+,Mg2+-free and 0.5 mm EDTA) on ice for 20 min. The cells were then harvested by gently scraping with a cell scraper and replated on 96-well tissue culture plates in a density of 1 × 105 cells/well with culture medium supplemented with M-CSF (25 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) and receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) (100 ng/ml; Peprotech). For TRAP staining, the cells were fixed in a mixture of citrate (6.75 mm), acetone (65%), and formalin (3.7%) for 90 s and washed with 1× PBS three times at room temperature. TRAP staining solution was prepared following the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Sigma). The cells were incubated in the TRAP staining solution for 15 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by rinsing the cells with distilled water. The stained cells were air dried and photographed with a conventional microscope equipped with a video camera (Olympus). Quantification of multinucleated TRAP-positive osteoclasts was performed by analyzing the images with MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). TRAP-positive multinucleated (>3 nuclei) cells were considered mature osteoclasts. Total RNA was extracted using a RNeasy kit (Qiagen) at the indicated time points during osteoclast culture experimentation. The quantity of total RNA was measured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). RNA integrity was evaluated by agarose-formaldehyde electrophoresis. RNA preparation displayed the characteristic pattern of nondegraded cellular RNA with distinct ribosomal RNA bands, having a 28 S band twice the intensity of the 18 S band. RNA was reverse transcribed (250 ng of total RNA in 10 μl of reverse transcription reaction) using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). The cDNA samples were diluted 20-fold with nuclease-free water and used as a template for real time quantitative PCR with 2× SYBR Green master mix and oligonucleotide primers. The oligonucleotide primers were designed using PerlPrimer (30Marshall O.J. PerlPrimer. Cross-platform, graphical primer design for standard, bisulphite and real-time PCR.Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 2471-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Quantitative real time PCR was performed using MyIQ single-color real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Standard PCR conditions were 95 °C (5 min) and then 40 cycles of 94 °C (10 s), 60 °C (20 s), and 72 °C (15 s), followed by the standard denaturation curve with 0.5 °C increments for 70 cycles. The threshold cycle number (31Schefe J.H. Lehmann K.E. Buschmann I.R. Unger T. Funke-Kaiser H. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR data analysis. Current concepts and the novel “gene expression's CT difference” formula.J. Mol. Med. 2006; 84: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) for each PCR is determined by setting the same threshold value across all PCR arrays. For data normalization, β-actin was selected as the reference endogenous control gene. The comparative CT method was used to calculate relative quantification of gene expression. The relative amount of transcripts for each gene in samples A and B was normalized to β-actin and calculated as follows: ΔCT is the log2difference between the gene and the reference gene and is obtained by subtracting the average CT of β-actin from the CT value of the gene. The log2fold change between the two samples was obtained using the following formula: ΔΔCT = the average ΔCT of sample B − the average ΔCT of sample A, and their fold difference = 2−ΔΔCT. For each gene, the fold change between the two samples was generated by calculating the ratio of the average of the normalized signals for all sample B replicates to the average of the normalized signals for all sample A replicates. The relative expression levels were plotted in fold change setting “WT at day 0” to 1. Aliquots of BMMs were serum-starved for 3 h and treated with the indicated reagents. The cells were then rinsed once with cold 1× PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with cOmplete® protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were cleared by 5 min of centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C, and then total protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The lysates were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 50 mm DTT), denatured for 5 min at 95 °C, and then resolved by SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman) by electroblotting and subjected to immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. The blots were developed using SuperSignal West Pico or Femto Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) and exposed and imaged using the Gel-Doc imaging system (Bio-Rad). β-Actin served as an internal control for equal amount loading of proteins. Primary antibodies used in this study were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). AMPKα2-specific antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Grahame Hardie at the University of Dundee (Dundee, UK). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). BMMs were seeded in a density of 60,000 cells/cm2 and labeled with 10 μm BrdU in 1- PBS (pH 7.4) for 4 h. The BrdU incorporation was detected by chemiluminescent ELISA method using a BrdU Cell Proliferation ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's protocol. The data were analyzed for statistical significance using student t test. The results are presented as the means and S.E. The difference between the experimental groups (WT versus Prkaa1−/−, or WT versus Prkaa2−/−) was considered to be statistically significant, if p < 0.05. To examine the role of AMPK in bone mass regulation, 3-month-old AMPKα-null and age-matched WT mice were used. This particular age was chosen because mice at this age do not exhibit statistically significant changes in bone mineral density (32Babij P. Zhao W. Small C. Kharode Y. Yaworsky P.J. Bouxsein M.L. Reddy P.S. Bodine P.V. Robinson J.A. Bhat B. Marzolf J. Moran R.A. Bex F. High bone mass in mice expressing a mutant LRP5 gene.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 960-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Of note, there were no significant changes in body weight and size associated with the loss of AMPKα1 or AMPKα2 at the age for this study (data not shown), suggesting that germ line deletion of catalytic subunit of AMPK may not have a significant impact on skeletal development before adulthood. μCT analysis of femurs revealed that absence of AMPKα1 caused a marked decrease in bone mass (Fig. 1, A–C). The bone mass documented by bone fraction (BV/TV) in Prkaa1−/− mice was 16%, whereas it was 25% in age-matched WT mice (Fig. 1B). AMPKα1 deficiency did not have a significant impact on the cortical bone thickness, at least, with the sample size of this study (n = 7) (data not shown). Prkaa1−/− mice also had lower apparent density than their WT counterparts (Fig. 1C). The reduction in bone mass and bone density was also observed in Prkaa2−/− mice (Fig. 1, D and E), although these changes were less pronounced than that in Prkaa1−/− mice. The reduction of bone mass in Prkaa1−/− and Prkaa2−/− mice seemed to occur mainly in cancellous bones, as revealed by bone histomorphometric analysis of proximal metaphysic of tibia (Fig. 2). In addition, the histomorphometric analysis showed that trabecular number and thickness were decreased, whereas trabecular separation was increased in Prkaa1−/− bones compared with WT (Fig. 2, A–E), which corroborates the μCT results. Prkaa2−/− mice also displayed a reduction in bone mass in cancellous bone (Fig. 2, F–I). Again, the extent of decrease appeared to be less than the difference between Prkaa1−/− and WT mice. There were only marginal differences in cortical bone mass between AMPKα-null and WT mice, supporting the conclusion that the major alterations in bone mass by AMPKα deficiency primarily take place in cancellous bone, where higher rates of bone remodeling occur in young adult bones.FIGURE 2Genetic deletion of catalytic subunit of AMPK reduces cancellous bone mass.

https://openalex.org/W2147238119,"Viral glycoproteins mediate fusion between viral and cellular membranes upon binding to cognate receptors and/or experiencing low pH. Although activation of viral glycoproteins is thought to be necessary and sufficient for fusion, accumulating evidence suggests that additional cellular factors, including lipids, can modulate the fusion process. Understanding the role of lipids in virus entry via endocytosis is impeded by poor accessibility and the highly diverse nature of endosomes. Here we imaged fusion of single retroviral particles pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein with dextran-supported lipid bilayers. Incorporation of diffusible fluorescent labels into the viral membrane and the viral interior enabled detection of the lipid mixing (hemifusion) and content transfer (full fusion) steps of VSV G-mediated fusion at low pH. Although single virus fusion with supported bilayers made of zwitterionic lipids could not be detected, inclusion of anionic lipids, phosphatidylserine, and bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), greatly enhanced the efficiency of hemifusion and permitted full fusion. Importantly, lipid mixing always preceded the opening of a fusion pore, demonstrating that VSV G-mediated fusion proceeds through a long-lived hemifusion intermediate. Kinetic analysis of lipid and content transfer showed that the lags between lipid and content mixing defining the lifetime of a hemifusion intermediate were significantly shorter for BMP-containing compared with PS-containing bilayers. The strong fusion-enhancing effect of BMP, a late endosome-resident lipid, is consistent with the model that VSV initiates fusion in early endosomes but releases its core into the cytosol after reaching late endosomal compartments."
https://openalex.org/W2018744969,"The monomeric Rho GTPases are essential for cellular regulation including cell architecture and movement. A direct mechanism for hormonal regulation of the RhoA-type GTPases is their modulation by the G12 and G13 proteins via RH (RGS homology) containing RhoGEFs. In addition to the interaction of the G protein α subunits with the RH domain, activated RhoA also binds to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PDZRhoGEF. The latter interaction is now extended to all seven members of the homologous Lbc family of RhoGEFs which includes the RH-RhoGEFs. This is evinced by direct measurements of binding or through effects on selected signaling pathways in cells. Overexpression of these PH domains alone can block RhoA-dependent signaling in cells to various extents. Whereas activated RhoA does not modulate the intrinsic activity of the RhoGEFs, activated RhoA associated with phospholipid vesicles can facilitate increased activity of soluble RhoGEFs on vesicle-delimited substrate (RhoA-GDP). This demonstrates feasibility of the hypothesis that binding of activated RhoA to the PH domains acts as a positive feedback mechanism. This is supported by cellular studies in which mutation of this binding site on PH strongly attenuates the stimulation of RhoA observed by overexpression of five of the RhoGEF DH-PH domains. This mutation is even more dramatic in the context of full-length p115RhoGEF. The utilization of this mechanism by multiple RhoGEFs suggests that this regulatory paradigm may be a common feature in the broader family of RhoGEFs."
https://openalex.org/W2078605274,"β-Galactosidase (lacZ) has bifunctional activity. It hydrolyzes lactose to galactose and glucose and catalyzes the intramolecular isomerization of lactose to allolactose, the lac operon inducer. β-Galactosidase promotes the isomerization by means of an acceptor site that binds glucose after its cleavage from lactose and thus delays its exit from the site. However, because of its relatively low affinity for glucose, details of this site have remained elusive. We present structural data mapping the glucose site based on a substituted enzyme (G794A-β-galactosidase) that traps allolactose. Various lines of evidence indicate that the glucose of the trapped allolactose is in the acceptor position. The evidence includes structures with Bis-Tris (2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-2,2',2″-nitrilotriethanol) and L-ribose in the site and kinetic binding studies with substituted β-galactosidases. The site is composed of Asn-102, His-418, Lys-517, Ser-796, Glu-797, and Trp-999. Ser-796 and Glu-797 are part of a loop (residues 795-803) that closes over the active site. This loop appears essential for the bifunctional nature of the enzyme because it helps form the glucose binding site. In addition, because the loop is mobile, glucose binding is transient, allowing the release of some glucose. Bioinformatics studies showed that the residues important for interacting with glucose are only conserved in a subset of related enzymes. Thus, intramolecular isomerization is not a universal feature of β-galactosidases. Genomic analyses indicated that lac repressors were co-selected only within the conserved subset. This shows that the glucose binding site of β-galactosidase played an important role in lac operon evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2116110106,"As ubiquitous molecular chaperones, small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are crucial for protein homeostasis. It is not clear why sHSPs are able to bind a wide spectrum of non-native substrate proteins and how such binding is enhanced by heat shock. Here, by utilizing a genetically incorporated photo-cross-linker (p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine), we systematically characterized the substrate-binding residues in IbpB (a sHSP from Escherichia coli) in living cells over a wide spectrum of temperatures (from 20 to 50 °C). A total of 20 and 48 residues were identified at normal and heat shock temperatures, respectively. They are not necessarily hydrophobic and can be classified into three types: types I and II were activated at low and normal temperatures, respectively, and type III mediated oligomerization at low temperature but switched to substrate binding at heat shock temperature. In addition, substrate binding of IbpB in living cells began at temperatures as low as 25 °C and was further enhanced upon temperature elevation. Together, these in vivo data provide novel structural insights into the wide substrate spectrum of sHSPs and suggest that sHSP is able to hierarchically activate its multi-type substrate-binding residues and thus act as a robust chaperone in cells under fluctuating growth conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2133525227,"Temporal lobe epilepsy is frequently associated with granule cell dispersion (GCD), an abnormal widening of the granule cell layer in the dentate gyrus. There is increasing evidence that a loss and the functional inactivation of the positional signal Reelin is involved in GCD formation. Reelin is synthesized and released by Cajal-Retzius cells and interneurons, and its function depends on proteolytic cleavage after secretion. Epileptic conditions impair Reelin processing by inhibition of matrix metalloprotease (MMP) activity and cause the extracellular accumulation of unprocessed Reelin. Here we investigated how epileptic conditions inhibit MMP activity. We used kainate (KA) treatment of organotypic hippocampal slice cultures as an epilepsy model and found a significant increase of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases 1 (TIMP-1) levels and strongly enhanced TIMP-1 immunolabeling in hippocampal neurons. Functional inhibition of TIMP-1 prevented the KA-induced impairment of Reelin cleavage indicating that TIMP-1 inhibits MMP activity. Moreover, application of recombinant TIMP-1 alone was sufficient to impair Reelin processing and to induce GCD, similar to that observed after KA treatment. In summary, we present evidence that epileptic conditions inhibit MMP activity by up-regulation of endogenous TIMP-1, which in turn leads to extracellular accumulation of uncleaved and inactive Reelin and thereby to GCD.—Tinnes, S., Ringwald, J., Haas, C.

https://openalex.org/W2054936230,"Cytosolic α-mannosidase (Man2C1) trims free oligosaccharides in mammalian cells, and its down-regulation reportedly delays cancer growth by inducing mitotic arrest or apoptosis. However, the mechanism by which Man2C1 down-regulation induces apoptosis is unknown. Here, we demonstrated that silencing of Man2C1 via small hairpin RNAs induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in HeLa cells. Expression of CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein), a transcription factor critical to endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis, was significantly up-regulated in Man2C1 knockdown cells. However, this enhanced CHOP expression was not caused by endoplasmic reticulum stress. Interestingly, Man2C1 catalytic activity was not required for this regulation of apoptosis; introduction of mutant, enzymatically inactive Man2C1 rescued apoptotic phenotypes of Man2C1 knockdown cells. These results show that Man2C1 has dual functions: one in glycan catabolism and another in apoptotic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2121929631,"Mucins are the main components of the gastrointestinal mucus layer. Mucin glycosylation is critical to most intermolecular and intercellular interactions. However, due to the highly complex and heterogeneous mucin glycan structures, the encoded biological information remains largely encrypted. Here we have developed a methodology based on force spectroscopy to identify biologically accessible glycoepitopes in purified porcine gastric mucin (pPGM) and purified porcine jejunal mucin (pPJM). The binding specificity of lectins Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA), peanut (Arachis hypogaea) agglutinin (PNA), Maackia amurensis lectin II (MALII), and Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA) was utilized in force spectroscopy measurements to quantify the affinity and spatial distribution of their cognate sugars at the molecular scale. Binding energy of 4, 1.6, and 26 aJ was determined on pPGM for RCA, PNA, and UEA. Binding was abolished by competition with free ligands, demonstrating the validity of the affinity data. The distributions of the nearest binding site separations estimated the number of binding sites in a 200-nm mucin segment to be 4 for RCA, PNA, and UEA, and 1.8 for MALII. Binding site separations were affected by partial defucosylation of pPGM. Furthermore, we showed that this new approach can resolve differences between gastric and jejunum mucins."
https://openalex.org/W1979527210,"Plasma membrane microcompartments could allow different signaling pathways to operate more efficiently and prevent cross-talk. We utilized a novel in-cell biotin transfer assay to demonstrate that the majority of plasma membrane-expressed D2 dopamine receptor (D2R) is microcompartmentalized within detergent-resistant structures. Conversely, a minority of D2R existed in a detergent-soluble form and interacted in a relatively unrestricted manner with other cellular proteins. The microcompartmentalization of D2R had functional consequences because dopamine-induced internalization of D2R was largely restricted to the compartmentalized receptor. The D2R-containing microcompartments did not correspond to putative detergent-resistant lipid raft structures. First, the detergent-insoluble D2R structures were significantly denser than detergent-resistant membrane fragments containing flotillin, a widely utilized lipid raft marker protein. Second, the detergent solubility of D2R was unaffected by treatment of cells with the cholesterol chelating agent, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, that is thought to disrupt lipid rafts. Finally, the in-cell biotinylation assay did not provide any evidence for the membrane compartmentalization of peptide motifs thought to target to lipid rafts. Thus, our observations form one of the first demonstrations, in living cells, of plasma membrane microcompartments defined by the ability of the compartment structure to broadly restrict the interaction of resident molecules with other cellular proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2035847378,"Exogenous hyaluronan is known to alter muscle precursor cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, ultimately inhibiting myogenesis in vitro. The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of endogenous hyaluronan synthesis during myogenesis. In quantitative PCR studies, the genes responsible for synthesizing hyaluronan were found to be differentially regulated during muscle growth, repair, and pathology. Although all Has genes (Has1, Has2, and Has3) were differentially regulated in these models, only Has2 gene expression consistently associated with myogenic differentiation. During myogenic differentiation in vitro, Has2 was the most highly expressed of the synthases and increased after induction of differentiation. To test whether this association between Has2 expression and myogenesis relates to a role for Has2 in myoblast differentiation and fusion, C2C12 myoblasts were depleted of Has2 by siRNA and induced to differentiate. Depletion of Has2 inhibited differentiation and caused a loss of cell-associated hyaluronan and the hyaluronan-dependent pericellular matrix. The inhibition of differentiation caused by loss of hyaluronan was confirmed with the hyaluronan synthesis inhibitor 4-methylumbelliferone. In hyaluronan synthesis-blocked cultures, restoration of the pericellular matrix could be achieved through the addition of exogenous hyaluronan and the proteoglycan versican, but this was not sufficient to restore differentiation to control levels. These data indicate that intrinsic hyaluronan synthesis is necessary for myoblasts to differentiate and form syncytial muscle cells, but the hyaluronan-dependent pericellular matrix is not sufficient to support differentiation alone; additional hyaluronan-dependent cell functions that are yet unknown may be required for myogenic differentiation. Exogenous hyaluronan is known to alter muscle precursor cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, ultimately inhibiting myogenesis in vitro. The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of endogenous hyaluronan synthesis during myogenesis.

Although all Has genes (Has1, Has2, and Has3) were differentially regulated in these models, only Has2 gene expression consistently associated with myogenic differentiation. During myogenic differentiation in vitro, Has2 was the most highly expressed of the synthases and increased after induction of differentiation. To test whether this association between Has2 expression and myogenesis relates to a role for Has2 in myoblast differentiation and fusion, C2C12 myoblasts were depleted of Has2 by siRNA and induced to differentiate. Depletion of Has2 inhibited differentiation and caused a loss of cell-associated hyaluronan and the hyaluronan-dependent pericellular matrix. The inhibition of differentiation caused by loss of hyaluronan was confirmed with the hyaluronan synthesis inhibitor 4-methylumbelliferone. In hyaluronan synthesis-blocked cultures, restoration of the pericellular matrix could be achieved through the addition of exogenous hyaluronan and the proteoglycan versican, but this was not sufficient to restore differentiation to control levels. These data indicate that intrinsic hyaluronan synthesis is necessary for myoblasts to differentiate and form syncytial muscle cells, but the hyaluronan-dependent pericellular matrix is not sufficient to support differentiation alone; additional hyaluronan-dependent cell functions that are yet unknown may be required for myogenic differentiation. Hyaluronan is an acidic polysaccharide composed of repetitive units of N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid (1Laurent T.C. Chemistry and Molecular Biology of the Intercellular Matrix. Vol. 2. Academic Press, Inc., New York1970: 703-732Google Scholar). Hyaluronan is classified as a glycosaminoglycan; however, unlike the glycosaminoglycan-containing proteoglycans, it lacks a protein core. The molecular mass of hyaluronan can vary from 20 kDa to 10 MDa, depending on the chain length, and different cellular functions are ascribed to these different molecular masses (2Stern R. Devising a pathway for hyaluronan catabolism. Are we there yet?.Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 105R-115RCrossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan can be found associated with cells in a pericellular coat surrounding cells as well as mobile in solution. The physical properties, including the hygroscopic nature of hyaluronan, can convey mechanical support within connective tissue, which is especially important within synovial joints. Broadly, hyaluronan is linked to numerous tissue functions, including wound healing, inflammation, angiogenesis, and fibrosis (3Laurent T.C. Fraser J. Hyaluronan.FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar). In postnatal tissues, hyaluronan is found throughout the body; however, it is predominantly localized within the skin (∼50% of total hyaluronan), skeleton (∼30% of total hyaluronan), and skeletal muscle (∼10% of total hyaluronan) (4Reed R.K. Lilja K. Laurent T.C. Hyaluronan in the rat with special reference to the skin.Acta Physiol. Scand. 1988; 134: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In rats, hyaluronan was found in all muscles that were examined, and it was located in the connective tissue layers surrounding myofibers (the endomysium, perimysium, and epimysium) (5Laurent C.

Hyaluronan in human and rat muscle spindles.Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan is also associated with the functions of motility, migration, proliferation, and differentiation of cells from the mesenchymal lineage, including osteoblasts (8Huang L. Cheng Y.Y. Koo P.L.

The majority of studies examining the effect of hyaluronan on the differentiation and fusion of chicken-derived myoblasts concluded that myotubes were not as readily formed when myoblasts were cultured on a substratum consisting of hyaluronan compared with a collagen-I substratum (12Elson H.F. Ingwall J.S. The cell substratum modulates skeletal muscle differentiation.J. Supramol. Struct. 1980; 14: 313-328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kujawa M.J. Pechak D.G. Fiszman M.Y. Caplan A.I.

Culturing chick muscle cells on glycosaminoglycan substrates. Attachment and differentiation.Dev. Biol. 1983; 99: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies suggested that myoblasts lose their hyaluronan-dependent pericellular matrix when fusing into myotubes and that this is necessary to allow membranes of adjacent myoblasts to fuse (16Orkin R.W. Knudson W. Toole B.P. Loss of hyaluronate-dependent coat during myoblast fusion.Dev. Biol. 1985; 107: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Together, this work suggested that myoblast differentiation and fusion can be modulated by hyaluronan, where excess hyaluronan inhibits differentiation and a reduction in hyaluronan is required for fusion into syncytial muscle cells. A bimodal change in myoblast motility and decrease in the ability of newt myoblasts to differentiate has also been observed when cultured on a hyaluronan substratum (17Calve S. Odelberg S.J. Simon H.-G. A transitional extracellular matrix instructs cell behavior during muscle regeneration.Developmental Biology. 2010; 344: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although these studies suggest that exogenous hyaluronan can inhibit myoblast fusion, contrasting studies have found that a hyaluronan substratum coated on Chronoflex (polycarbonate polyurethane) can enhance myogenic differentiation and fusion compared with uncoated Chronoflex (18Petillo O. Margarucci S. Peluso G. Barbarisi A. Melone M.A. Ambrosio L. Nicolais L. Modulation of in vitro myogenesis induced by different polymer substrates.J. Mater. Sci. Mater. Med. 1999; 10: 595-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, although these few studies have examined myoblast responses to exogenous hyaluronan, none have examined how endogenously synthesized hyaluronan influences myoblast behavior. Hyaluronan synthase 1 (HAS1), 2 (HAS2), and 3 (HAS3) are the three enzymes found in mammals that synthesize hyaluronan (19Spicer A.P. Olson J.S. McDonald J.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22945-22948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The different synthases have been suggested to produce different size hyaluronan chains such that HAS2 can typically produce the largest chains, often greater than 2 MDa, whereas HAS1- and HAS3-synthesized hyaluronan chains are often shorter and range from 100 kDa to 2 MDa (21Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K.

Characterization and molecular evolution of a vertebrate hyaluronan synthase gene family.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1923-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Based on mouse knock-out studies of the three isoforms, it is apparent that Has2 is a crucial developmental gene. Cardiac morphogenesis of embryos lacking Has2 expression was abnormal, and cardiac endothelial cell migration and transition into mesenchyme were prevented (23Camenisch T.D. Spicer A.P. Brehm-Gibson T. Biesterfeldt J. Augustine M.L. Calabro Jr., A. Kubalak S. Klewer S.E. McDonald J.A.

This indicates that Has2 is crucial for development and cannot be compensated for by the other HAS enzymes. embryonic day n postnatal day n quantitative PCR 4-methylumbelliferone hyaluronan-binding protein myogenic regulatory factor. Increased Has2 expression has been observed in the longissimus dorsi muscles of sheep with the Callipyge mutation when compared with wild type (24Vuocolo T. Byrne K. White J. McWilliam S. Reverter A. Cockett N.E. Tellam R.L. Identification of a gene network contributing to hypertrophy in callipyge skeletal muscle.Physiol. Genomics. 2007; 28: 253-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The longissimus dorsi muscles of Callipyge sheep display a high degree of hypertrophy compared with wild type, which appears to occur postnatally. Has2 up-regulation occurs neonatally, prior to detection of hypertrophy, suggesting that Has2 could be associated with the cause of hypertrophy in Callipyge muscles. Very recent studies have also reported increases in hyaluronan synthesis in a model of compensatory hypertrophy (25Calve S. Isaac J. Gumucio J.P. Mendias C.L. Hyaluronic acid, HAS1, and HAS2 are significantly upregulated during muscle hypertrophy.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2012; 303: C577-C588Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Increased expression of Has1 and Has2 mRNAs was observed in this synergistic ablation model of hypertrophy, supporting the possibility of HAS2 mediating muscle growth and hypertrophy. Herein we examine Has expression during muscle development, postnatal regeneration following injury, dystrophic pathology, and in vitro myogenesis. We hypothesize that Has2 may be the primary Has gene involved in syncytial muscle cell formation and muscle growth and repair. The requirement for hyaluronan synthesis during in vitro myogenesis is investigated with the hyaluronan synthesis inhibitor 4-methylumbelliferone and siRNA-mediated knockdown of Has2 in C2C12 myoblasts induced to differentiate into syncytial muscle cells. We also contrast myogenic differentiation studies abolishing endogenously synthesized hyaluronan with those adding exogenous hyaluronan in order to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the role hyaluronan and, more specifically, Has2 play in the formation of muscle cells. Mouse experiments were carried out in strict accordance with National Health and Medical Research Council NHMRC guidelines for the care and use of animals in research under the approval of the Animal Welfare Committee, Deakin University, ethics number A41/2009 and the Faculty of Veterinary Science AEC, University of Melbourne, approval number 081090. Six-week-old C57/Bl6J (Animal Resources Centre, Western Australia) female mice were mated with male mice after 1700 h, and conception was confirmed before 0900 h the next morning by observation of vaginal mucus. The morning of conception was designated as gestational age 0.5 days (E0.5). Timed embryos were acquired at E12.5, E13.5, E14.5, E15.5, E16.5, and neonatal (day of birth, 21 days) time points, whereby proximal hind limbs of embryonic ages E12.5–E14.5 or proximal hind limb muscles of older embryos (dissected away from hard tissue) were collected and stored in TRIzol at −80 °C until further processing. Injections of notexin (obtained from Latoxan, France) into the tibialis anterior muscles of adult mice were performed as described previously (26Hunt L.C. Anthea Coles C. Gorman C.M. Tudor E.M. Smythe G.M. White J.D. Alterations in the expression of leukemia inhibitory factor following exercise. Comparisons between wild-type and mdx muscles.PLoS Curr. 2011; 3: RRN1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In brief, anesthetized C57BL/6 mice received a single intramuscular injection of 50 μl of 10 μg/ml notexin parallel along the tibia into the tibialis anterior muscle. Following notexin injection, at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 days, the tibialis anterior muscles were sampled. Five mice were also sampled without notexin injection as an uninjured control. Tibialis anterior muscles were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen in order to perform RNA extraction for quantitative PCR (qPCR) studies. The diaphragm muscles of C57BL10/mdx and C57BL10/ScSn mice at 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 weeks of age were excised and snap-frozen to perform qPCR. Histology samples were obtained by freezing tragacanth-mounted muscles in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane and cutting 10-μm-thick sections with a cryostat onto glass slides. C2C12 myoblast lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in growth medium consisting of 10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). To induce differentiation as cells were approaching confluence, growth medium was replaced with differentiation medium containing 2% horse serum in DMEM. Differentiation medium was replenished every 24 h until the end point of the experiment. 4-Methylumbelliferone (4MU) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 1 mm and subsequently diluted out into medium to the described concentrations. 4MU treatments in differentiation experiments were performed by adding 4MU to the growth medium, which was then incubated with myoblasts for 24 h prior to the induction of differentiation, at which point the medium was removed and replaced with 4MU-containing differentiation medium that was subsequently replenished every 24 h until the end of the experiment. Hyaluronan was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (H5388) and was derived from rooster comb, for which the supplier expects an average molecular mass in the range of 1–4 MDa. Hyaluronan was reconstituted in PBS and added to culture medium at the described concentrations with dilutions of PBS as vehicle control. RNA was extracted from developing proximal hind limb muscles as per the manufacturer's protocol using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and equal amounts of total RNA (up to 1 μg) were reverse-transcribed with either the Superscript III reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) or iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Quantitative PCR was performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and relevant primers for the genes of interest. The Quant-iT OliGreen ssDNA assay kit (Invitrogen) was used to quantitate total cDNA as per the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was extracted from snap-frozen adult muscle tissue and cells by homogenizing in 1 ml of Tri-reagent, followed by the addition of chloroform to retrieve the RNA-containing aqueous layer. The aqueous layer was added in equal volume to a solution comprising one part 90% ethanol and one part SV lysis solution from the SV total RNA isolation system (Promega). The resulting solution was then passed through the SV columns and DNase-treated. The RNA was eluted from the columns, and 1 μg of RNA per sample was reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) to produce cDNA. Real-time qPCRs were performed on a LightCycler 480 (Roche Applied Science), and the cycle thresholds (Ct) were calculated. Expression data were derived from the Ct and normalized to the housekeeper hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt) for the in vivo studies and peptidylprolyl isomerase A (Ppia) for in vitro studies. These were the most appropriate housekeepers because they possessed the least variability across all samples within the study compared with other housekeepers tested, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) and β-actin (Actb), using the “Bestkeeper” Excel-based tool (27Pfaffl M.W.

A biotinylated hyaluronan-binding protein (G1 domain of aggrecan) was kindly provided by Amanda Fosang (Murdoch Children's Research Institute) and was used to label hyaluronan as described previously (28Fosang A.J. Hey N.J. Carney S.L. Hardingham T.E. An ELISA plate-based assay for hyaluronan using biotinylated proteoglycan G1 domain (HA-binding region).Matrix. 1990; 10: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cultures and tissue sections were initially fixed in 4% formaldehyde containing 1% hexadecylpyridinium chloride monohydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min at room temperature. They were then washed three times with PBS. The hyaluronan-binding protein (HABP) was diluted in PBS to 5 μg/ml and added to the cultures for 60 min at room temperature. After this incubation, samples were washed with three changes of PBS. The HABP was detected with an AlexaFluor-594 streptavidin conjugate diluted 1:500 in PBS (Invitrogen). Samples were counterstained with DAPI. Incubation with 200 units/ml hyaluronidase from Streptomyces hyalurolyticus for 3 h at 37 °C was performed to demonstrate the specificity of the binding protein for hyaluronan. For detection of laminin and desmin, the rat anti-laminin α-2 (4H8-2) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and mouse anti-desmin (DE-U-10) antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) were used. The fusion index in differentiated C2C12 cultures, which is the percentage of nuclei contained within syncytial myotubes, was determined by immunofluorescence for desmin, a protein highly enriched in syncytial myotubes. Cells were fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, washed, and subsequently incubated with the primary antibody, mouse anti-desmin, and subsequently probed with an anti-mouse AlexaFluor-488 secondary antibody. C2C12 cells were transfected with 50 pmol of Has2 Stealth Select RNAi siRNA (MSS236746; Invitrogen) in 50 μl of Opti-MEM and 1 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 6 h in serum- and antibiotic-free medium (0.5 ml in 24-well plates), and then an additional 0.5 ml of growth medium was added to each culture. Cells were cultured overnight before all medium was removed and replaced with normal growth medium (10% FBS). Controls were instead transfected with Stealth RNAi siRNA Negative Control Lo-GC (12935-200, Invitrogen). C2C12 cells were transfected with the versican construct, which was kindly provided by Suneel Apte, by a similar method. A ratio of 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA to 1 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 50 μl of Opti-MEM was used to transfect each well of a 24-well plate by seeding 10,000 cells directly into the DNA and Lipofectamine 2000 mix-containing wells. Creatine kinase activity from lysed myoblast cultures was determined as described previously (29Hunt L.C. Upadhyay A. Jazayeri J.A. Tudor E.M. White J.D. Caspase-3, myogenic transcription factors and cell cycle inhibitors are regulated by leukemia inhibitory factor to mediate inhibition of myogenic differentiation.Skelet. Muscle. 2011; 1: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In brief, cultures were lysed with 150 μl of lysis buffer containing 40 mm MES buffer, 50 mm Trizma base, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. Insoluble material in the cellular lysate was pelleted, and 10 μl of the supernatant was combined with 200 μl of CK-NAC reagent (Thermo Scientific). Creatine kinase activity was measured by the change in absorbance at 340 nm over 3 min (20-s intervals) at 37 °C. The change in absorbance was converted to activity in units/liter based on the molar absorption coefficient of NADH at 340 nm and normalized to DNA content. Total DNA content was assayed using SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (10,000×) (Invitrogen) diluted 1:500 with water. Diluted SYBR Safe (1 μl) was combined with 19 μl of cell lysate or genomic DNA standards (0.78–100 μg/ml) into a black 384-well plate, and the SYBR fluorescence was quantitated on the Paradigm Detection Platform (Beckman Coulter). The size of the pericellular matrix surrounding live C2C12 myoblasts was determined by a particle exclusion assay similar to that described previously (30Hattori N. Carrino D.A. Lauer M.E. Vasanji A.

C2C12 myoblasts transfected to express GFP were seeded at a density of 5,000 cells/well in 6-well plates, and after 2 days of either 4-methylumbelliferone or Has2 siRNA, the assay was performed. Lyophilized sheep erythrocytes (Sigma-Aldrich) were resuspended in 10 ml of PBS, postfixed with 1.5% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed, and finally resuspended again in 10 ml of PBS. An aliquot (30 μl) of this cell suspension (containing ∼2 × 107 erythrocytes) was added to the cultures, and the erythrocytes were allowed to settle for ∼10 min. The pericellular exclusion area was visualized by imaging the GFP-positive C2C12 cells and the red autofluorescent erythrocytes on an inverted microscope. Binary masks of these images were generated in ImageJ in order to measure the area occupied by the C2C12 cells plus the pericellular space excluding erythrocytes (from which the exclusion area was derived). The size of the myoblasts and the space between the cell membrane of the myoblast and the erythrocytes surrounding them were measured in a blinded fashion with 50 randomly selected cells measured per treatment group. Hyaluronidase digestion was also performed in cultures with 0.5 unit/ml hyaluronidase from S. hyalurolyticus (Sigma-Aldrich) in serum-free medium for 1 h prior to the exclusion assay as a control. GraphPad Prism software was used for statistical analysis. Student's t tests were performed when comparing a single treatment with control. All histograms represent the mean and the S.E. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare multiple treatments with control, and two-way analysis of variance was used when additional variables were considered. A 95% confidence interval was accepted, where p ≤ 0.05 was deemed significant and is denoted on histograms with an asterisk. The Relative Expression Software Tool was used to analyze statistical differences between Ct values from qPCR (31Pfaffl M.W. A new mathematical model for relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25413) Google Scholar). C2C12 myoblasts were induced to differentiate and fuse into multinucleate myotubes over a period of 72 h in differentiation medium. During this time, mRNA was extracted, and Has transcript levels examined by qPCR (Fig. 1A). Has1 expression was at a maximum in undifferentiated nearly confluent myoblasts and decreased as differentiation and fusion proceeded. Has2 expression demonstrated an inverse trend, where expression was lowest in undifferentiated myoblasts but increased as differentiation and fusion proceeded. Has3 expression did not appear to fluctuate throughout the time course."

Sequestration of parasite-infected red blood cells in brain microvasculature utilizes host- and parasite-derived adhesion molecules and is an important factor in the development of CM. ICAM-1, an alternatively spliced adhesion molecule, is believed to be critical on endothelial cells for infected red blood cell sequestration in CM. Using ICAM-1 mutant mice, we found that the full-length ICAM-1 isoform is not required for development of murine experimental CM (ECM) and that ECM phenotype varies with the combination of ICAM-1 isoforms expressed. Furthermore, we observed development of ECM in transgenic mice expressing ICAM-1 only on leukocytes, indicating that endothelial cell expression of this adhesion molecule is not required for disease pathogenesis. We propose that ICAM-1-dependent cellular aggregation, independent of ICAM-1 expression on the cerebral microvasculature, contributes to ECM."

The trans-proline sets a molecular timer to maintain the binding-active state long enough for the phage to interact with TolA. We elucidated the changes in structure and local stability that lead to partial unfolding and thus to the activation of the gene-3-protein for phage infection. Protein folding and TolA binding experiments were combined with real-time NMR spectroscopy, amide hydrogen exchange measurements, and phage infectivity assays. In combination, the results provide a molecular picture of how a local unfolding reaction couples with prolyl isomerization not only to generate the activated state of a protein but also to maintain it for an extended time. Infection of Escherichia coli by the filamentous phage fd starts with the binding of the N2 domain of the phage gene-3-protein to an F pilus. This interaction triggers partial unfolding of the gene-3-protein, cis → trans isomerization at Pro-213, and domain disassembly, thereby exposing its binding site for the ultimate receptor TolA.

The filamentous phage fd initiates the infection of Escherichia coli cells by two sequential binding events. First, it attaches to the tip of an F pilus, and then it interacts with the membrane-bound protein TolA at the cell surface (1Click E.M. Webster R.E.

Both interactions are mediated by the phage gene-3-protein, which exists in 3–5 copies at one end of the phage. The protein consists of three domains.

The N1-N2 entity of the gene-3-protein (called “G3P” in this article) protrudes from the phage tip. In the fully folded form of G3P, N1 and N2 are tightly associated with each other (5Holliger P. Riechmann L. Williams R.L. Crystal structure of the two N-terminal domains of g3p from filamentous phage fd at 1.9 Ä: evidence for conformational lability.J. Mol.

However, this form is autoinhibited, and the phage is noninfectious because the binding site for TolA-C is buried at the domain interface. To overcome this intramolecular inhibition, the interdomain contacts between N1 and N2 must be broken during the infection process. In fact, after the initial binding of the N2 domain to the F pilus, the interactions between N1, N2, and the interdomain hinge are weakened, and the TolA binding site of N1 becomes accessible (7Eckert B.

The domain disassembly allows Pro-213 in the hinge (Fig. 1B) to isomerize from the strained cis to the more favorable trans conformation (9Martin A. Schmid F.X.

Pro-213 thus functions as a molecular switch. The infectious form of G3P is turned on by cis → trans and turned off by trans → cis isomerization of the Gln-212–Pro-213 peptide bond. During refolding of G3P, Pro-213 trans → cis isomerization is the final and rate-limiting step and controls domain assembly (9Martin A. Schmid F.X.

The structure of the folding intermediate that accumulates before this final folding step was analyzed by NMR spectroscopy for a variant of G3P, termed G3P IIHY, which carries the four stabilizing substitutions T13I, T101I, Q129H, and D209Y (11Martin A. Schmid F.X. Evolutionary stabilization of the gene-3-protein of phage fd reveals the principles that govern the thermodynamic stability of two-domain proteins.J. Mol.

A remote prolyl isomerization controls domain assembly via a hydrogen bonding network.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12335-12340Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Due to its high thermodynamic stability and robust folding, this variant has been used to study the folding mechanism of G3P. Pro-213 trans → cis isomerization in the final folding step was shown to be accompanied by the tightening of a hydrogen-bonding network between the hinge region and the N1 domain and by a strong stabilization of the N2 domain. It is our aim to understand how changes in the domain interactions of G3P, partial unfolding, and prolyl isomerization activate the phage for binding to its receptor TolA. We modulated the stability of G3P, the domain interactions, and the isomerization rate of Pro-213 by targeted amino acid substitutions, in particular in the contact regions between the domains and around Pro-213. Then, we analyzed the consequences of these substitutions for the folding of G3P, for its interaction with the receptor TolA, and for the infectivity of phage variants carrying the same substitutions in their G3P. High-resolution NMR techniques were employed to reveal, at residue resolution, the differences in structure and stability between the fully folded autoinhibited form of G3P and the partially unfolded activated form. To generate the different variants of the N1-N2 fragment of the gene-3-protein (G3P), site-directed mutagenesis was performed by blunt end PCR using primers with the corresponding mutations. The G3P variants, the isolated N1 domain (residues 1–67 of mature G3P, extended by an Ala(His)6 tag), the isolated N2 domain (residues 102–205 of mature G3P followed by (His)6), and TolA-C (residues 295–421 of TolA, with a Cys (Ala)3(His)6 tag) were expressed and purified as described (7Eckert B.

Heat-induced unfolding transitions of isolated N1, domain N1 in wild-type G3P, and its variants were measured by the change in circular dichroism (CD) at 230 nm with 4.0 μm protein in 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) using a JASCO J-600A spectropolarimeter equipped with a PTC-348 WI Peltier device. The unfolding transition of isolated N2 (4.0 μm) was monitored by the increase in CD at 222 nm. For N2 in the N1-N2 fragment of G3P (1.0 μm), the decrease in CD at 210 nm was used as a probe (11Martin A. Schmid F.X. Evolutionary stabilization of the gene-3-protein of phage fd reveals the principles that govern the thermodynamic stability of two-domain proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All measurements were performed in 10-mm cells with a 1-nm bandwidth and a heating rate of 60 K/h. The data were analyzed as described before (14Mayr L.M. Schmid F.X. Stabilization of a protein by guanidinium chloride.Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7994-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) using nonlinear regression and the program GraFit (Erithacus Software, Staines, UK). The kinetics of binding of TolA-C-Aedans to isolated N1 or to N1 in the G3P variants were followed at 25 °C after stopped-flow mixing in a DX.17MV stopped-flow fluorometer (Applied Photophysics) by the change in fluorescence above 460 nm after excitation at 280 nm. To absorb scattered light from the excitation beam, a 0.5-cm cell with p-nitroaniline in ethanol was placed between the observation chamber and the emission photomultiplier. Association was initiated by 1:1 dilution, resulting in final concentrations of 0–14 μm G3P and 0.2 μm TolA-C-Aedans in 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.1 m GdmCl. Individual kinetics were measured eight times, averaged, and analyzed using monoexponential functions. The resulting amplitudes and apparent rates were plotted as a function of the G3P concentration. The plot of the rate constants was analyzed using linear regression. The rate constant of association kon(app) was derived from the slope, and the rate constant of dissociation koff was derived from the ordinate intercept of this plot. To measure the kinetics of interaction between TolA-C-Aedans and the active forms with a trans-Pro-213 of wild-type G3P and of G3P IIHY, the active form was populated in an interrupted refolding experiment. Denatured G3P (in 5.0 m GdmCl) was diluted 25-fold with 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) to initiate refolding at 25 °C. After 10 min, the samples were cooled to 4 °C to retard trans → cis isomerization of Pro-213 and transferred into the stopped-flow apparatus. The kinetics of binding were measured as described above. For all experiments, a derivative of the fCKCBS phage was used, which contains the gene for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase and G3P with a modified linker between the N2 and C-terminal domains (15Krebber C. Spada S. Desplancq D. Krebber A. Ge L. Plückthun A. Selectively-infective phage (SIP): a mechanistic dissection of a novel in vivo selection for protein-ligand interactions.J. Mol.

Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Phage were isolated from E. coli culture medium as described before, resulting in 50-μl aliquots (11Martin A. Schmid F.X. Evolutionary stabilization of the gene-3-protein of phage fd reveals the principles that govern the thermodynamic stability of two-domain proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Phage concentration was determined by isolating the phage DNA from 10 μl of the phage suspension and measuring its absorption at 260 nm. To compare the infectivity of wild-type phage with phage containing modified G3P toward pilus bearing (F+) E. coli XL1 Blue cells, 5 μl of the phage suspensions were mixed individually with 495 μl of a corresponding cell culture in dYT medium (5 g l−1 NaCl, 10 g l−1 yeast extract, 16 g l−1 caseine peptone, A600 ∼ 0.7) and incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. Then, the samples were centrifuged, and the remaining phage were removed with the supernatant. The cell pellets were washed, resuspended in 500 μl of dYT medium, and incubated at 25 °C for 25 min. Serial dilutions were plated on dYT agar containing 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol to determine the number of infectious phage. F pili-deficient E. coli HB2156 cells were infected with the same phage suspensions in the presence of 50 mm CaCl2. 25 μl of phage suspension and 25 μl of 1 m CaCl2 were added to 450 μl of an E. coli HB2156 cell culture (A600 ∼ 0.7) and incubated for 5 min at 25 °C. The remaining phage were removed by centrifugation, and infected cells were washed and resuspended in 100 μl of dYT medium. The number of infectious phage was again determined by plating serial dilutions on dYT agar containing 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. All NMR spectra were recorded in 50 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.0 (or pD 6.6) at 25 °C, containing 10 or 100% D2O. Spectra were processed using NMRPipe (17Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe: a multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11525) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRView (18Johnson B.A. Using NMRView to visualize and analyze the NMR spectra of macromolecules.Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 313-352PubMed Google Scholar). For the backbone resonance assignments (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table 1), trHNCACB and trHN (CO)CACB spectra of a 15N/13C/2H sample were acquired with a Bruker Avance 800 spectrometer. A 3.6 mm solution of TolA-C was titrated to 0.3 mm [15N]G3P in 14 steps up to a 12-fold excess of TolA-C (1.8 mm TolA-C, 0.15 mm G3P) and monitored by 15N-TROSY-HSQC spectra with a Bruker Avance 900 spectrometer. Free G3P and bound G3P were in slow exchange on the NMR timescale; therefore, binding was analyzed by the decrease of 1H15N cross-peaks of G3P. Intensities were corrected by the dilution factor. The analysis of the intensities suggested that the complex was fully formed when a slight molar excess of TolA-C was reached. Amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HX) of native G3P was followed by dissolving lyophilized protein in D2O buffer and measuring 60 15N-TROSY-HSQC spectra over 120 h with a Bruker Avance 800 spectrometer (Fig. 3, A—C). Amide HX of the IIHY variant of G3P followed the EX2 exchange mechanism (12Weininger U. Jakob R.P. Eckert B. Schweimer K. Schmid F.X. Balbach J. A remote prolyl isomerization controls domain assembly via a hydrogen bonding network.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12335-12340Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and we assume that the wild-type form shows EX2 exchange as well. To measure amide HX of the complex between G3P and TolA-C, 0.15 mm G3P and 0.60 mm TolA-C were dissolved in D2O buffer and the exchange was monitored by collecting 46 15N-TROSY-HSQC spectra over 91 h (Fig. 3, A, B, and D). For real-time NMR experiments, refolding of 4 mm [15N]G3P was started by a 4-fold dilution of the unfolded protein (in 4.0 m GdmCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) to a final GdmCl concentration of 1.0 m in the same buffer. After a dead time of 30 min, two identical 15N-TROSY-HSQC spectra were acquired successively by a Bruker Avance 900 spectrometer. The first (kinetic) spectrum was obtained during the folding reaction; the second spectrum was measured after the completion of refolding and served as the reference for fully folded G3P. The spectra were measured for 8 h each. Subtraction of the kinetic spectrum from the reference spectrum resulted in the difference spectrum. This experiment was repeated in the same way with 1.5 mm [15N]G3P in the presence of 2 mm TolA-C in the refolding buffer. For the competition experiment between refolding and amide HX, refolding of [15N]G3P (in 4.0 m GdmCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) was performed as described above, except that all buffers contained 100% H2O. After 5 min, when the refolding reactions of the individual domains were complete, the solvent was exchanged to a D2O-containing buffer without GdmCl using a NAP10 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). The competition between folding and amide HX was allowed to proceed for 10 h at 25 °C, and then a 15N-TROSY-HSQC spectrum was measured over 8 h at a Bruker Avance 900 spectrometer (Fig. 3, E and F). For referencing, an identical amide HX experiment was performed starting with the same amount of folded G3P in 1.0 m GdmCl. Amino acid substitutions that strengthen or weaken the domain interactions in G3P were employed to examine how alterations in the stability and the folding mechanism of G3P affect its function during phage infection (Fig. 1B). As a variant with stronger domain interactions, we used the IIHY form of G3P. It contains four substitutions, all identified in the course of an in vitro selection for stabilized phage variants (11Martin A. Schmid F.X. Evolutionary stabilization of the gene-3-protein of phage fd reveals the principles that govern the thermodynamic stability of two-domain proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar): T13I in the N1 domain, Q129H in the N2 domain, and T101I and D209Y in the hinge region. The T101I substitution, in particular, improves the interactions between the hinge region and the N1 domain. To weaken or abolish the domain interactions, we used two strategies. First, we substituted the residues 212 and 214 before and after the Pro-213 switch by Ala (in the G3P APA variant, Fig. 1B) or combined these two substitutions with the replacement of Pro-213 by Gly (in G3P AGA). Amino acid substitutions in this region decrease the stability of G3P and increase the rate of prolyl isomerization (7Eckert B. Martin A. Balbach J. Schmid F.X. Prolyl isomerization as a molecular timer in phage infection.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 619-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 10Martin A. Schmid F.X. A proline switch controls folding and domain interactions in the gene-3-protein of the filamentous phage fd.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The residues 212–214 thus determine the lifetime of the active, infectious form of G3P. In an alternative approach, we abolished the domain interactions by deleting strand β6 (residues 96–103) of the hinge region in G3P IIHY. This strand establishes key interactions within the hinge itself and with the N1 domain in the fully folded form of G3P (Fig. 1B). For the corresponding variant (G3P Δβ6), G3P IIHY was used as the parent protein as the wild-type form of G3P without strand β6 started to unfold already at 25 °C (19Lorenz S.H. Jakob R.P. Weininger U. Balbach J. Dobbek H. Schmid F.X. The filamentous phages fd and IF1 use different mechanisms to infect Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 405: 989-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions were made in both the gene encoding the N1-N2 fragment (G3P) for the in vitro studies and the phage genome used for the in vivo infection experiments. The isolated domains N1 and N2 served as reference proteins. Unfolding experiments were used to examine the strength of the domain interactions within the G3P variants. The interaction with TolA was analyzed by measuring the kinetics of binding with a labeled fluorescent variant of TolA-C (TolA-C-Aedans). The infectivities of the corresponding phage variants were determined by using cells with or without F pili (F+ or F−). The thermal unfolding transition of the N2 domain served as an indicator for the strength of the domain interactions in the G3P variants. As an isolated domain, N2 is only marginally stable and starts to unfold at 30 °C already (8Eckert B. Schmid F.X. A Conformational unfolding reaction activates phage fd for the infection of Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 452-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Jakob R.P. Schmid F.X. Energetic coupling between native-state prolyl isomerization and conformational protein folding.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 1560-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the fully folded form of G3P, N2 is stabilized by the strong interdomain interactions, and it unfolds only when these interactions are abolished. N1 is more stable and remains folded after domain disassembly. The unfolding of G3P, monitored by CD at 230 nm, thus shows two transitions (Fig. 4A) (8Eckert B. Schmid F.X. A Conformational unfolding reaction activates phage fd for the infection of Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 452-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Martin A. Schmid F.X. Evolutionary stabilization of the gene-3-protein of phage fd reveals the principles that govern the thermodynamic stability of two-domain proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The minor, first transition, reflects domain disassembly coupled with the unfolding of N2 and is used to probe the strength of the domain interactions in G3P. Substitutions that improve the domain interactions increase the midpoint (the Tm value) of this transition, and substitutions that loosen the domain interactions lead to a decrease. The first transition could also be followed by the change in CD at 210 nm (Fig. 4B) because N1 contributes little to the CD change at this wavelength. The substitutions in the hinge and in N2 led to large shifts in the Tm values of the first transition, whereas the stability of the N1 domain was affected only by the T13I substitution, which resides in this domain. The two stabilizing substitutions T101I and D209Y in the hinge increased the Tm of the first transition from 48.0 °C (G3P) to 61.2 °C (G3P IIHY) (Fig. 4, Table 1), which indicates that the domain interactions are strongly improved in this variant. In contrast, two other substitutions in the hinge, Q212A and P214A, adjacent to cis-Pro-213 (in G3P APA), decreased the Tm value to 36.8 °C (Fig. 4), which is only 2.2 °C higher than the Tm of the isolated N2 domain (Table 1). Thus, the domain interactions are severely weakened but not fully abolished in this variant. A similar destabilization was found for the G3P AGA variant, in which Pro-213 is substituted by Gly (Table 1).TABLE 1Stability data for the variants of G3P and the isolated domains N1 and N2 as derived from thermal unfolding transitionsVariantUnfolding of domain N2Unfolding of domain N1TmΔHΔG55 °CTmΔHΔG65 °C°CkJ mol−1kJ mol−1°CkJ mol−1kJ mol−1Wild-type G3P48.0612−14.160.2230−3.3G3P IIHY61.264411.467.52051.5G3P APA36.8331−24.659.9227−3.5G3P-AGA37.9470−30.458.6189−3.7G3P Δβ636.4368−21.165.9250−0.5Isolated domain N234.6304−25.4Isolated domain N2 Q129H38.8344−21.2Isolated domain N162.3234−1.9Isolated domain N1 T13I67.52351.7 Open table in a new tab The deletion of strand β6 in the hinge region (in G3P Δβ6) eliminated the domain interactions. The first unfolding transition of this variant shows a midpoint at 36.4 °C (Fig. 4), which is slightly lower than the value of 38.8 °C of the isolated N2 domain of G3P IIHY (N2 Q129H, Table 1). G3P Δβ6 thus provides a good model for a permanently active G3P without domain interactions. After the activation by domain disassembly, the N1 domain of G3P binds to TolA-C. We followed this binding reaction by the strong increase in the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Trp residues of the N1 domain and a variant of TolA-C that is labeled at its carboxyl terminus by an Aedans group (TolA-C-Aedans) (7Eckert B.

The kinetics of interaction between 0.2 μm TolA-C-Aedans and 0–14 μm of the G3P variants were measured in a stopped-flow apparatus. Binding followed pseudo first-order kinetics under all conditions (Fig. 5A), the amplitudes (Fig. 5B) showed saturation behavior, and the measured rates (Fig. 5C) depended linearly on the concentration of the G3P variants. The rates of association, kon(app), and of dissociation, koff, were obtained from the slopes and the intercepts, respectively, of the plots in Fig. 5C (Table 2). The apparent dissociation constants, KD(app), of the complexes between TolA-C-Aedans and the G3P variants were derived from the ratio of the rate constants kon(app) and koff, as well as from fitting binding curves to the amplitude data in Fig. 5B. These two KD(app) values agree well with each other for the individual G3P variants (Table 2).TABLE 2Binding of G3P variants to TolA-C AEDANSVariantkon(app)koffkoff/konKD(app)Kclμm−1s−1s−1μmμmIsolated domain N10.86 ± 0.010.26 ± 0.030.30.31 ± 0.020Isolated domain N1 T13I1.21 ± 0.020.16 ± 0.030.130.19 ± 0.010Wild-type G3P0.003 ± 0.0010.51 ± 0.0117122.1 ± 6.670G3P IIHYNDNDNDNDNDG3P-APA0.65 ± 0.010.37 ± 0.010.570.44 ± 0.020.4G3P-AGA0.19 ± 0.010.31 ± 0.011.681.26 ± 0.053.1G3P Δβ60.93 ± 0.010.26 ± 0.030.280.21 ± 0.010.1G3P folding intermediate (trans Pro213)0.19 ± 0.010.29 ± 0.011.541.85 ± 0.125.0G3P IIHY folding intermediate (trans-Pro-213)0.006 ± 0.0010.28 ± 0.014813.6 ± 1.871 Open table in a new tab TolA-C binds most strongly to the isolated N1 domain because the binding site is permanently accessible when the N2 domain and the hinge are absent. For G3P and its variants, the apparent affinity for TolA-C-Aedans (Table 2) decreases when the strength of the interactions between N1 and N2 increases, as reflected in the Tm values of the N2 domain (Table 1). In the stabilized variant G3P IIHY, the domain interactions are particularly tight, and therefore, an interaction with TolA-C-Aedans could not be detected. In the analysis of the binding data in Table 2, we assumed that the G3P variants exist in a do"
