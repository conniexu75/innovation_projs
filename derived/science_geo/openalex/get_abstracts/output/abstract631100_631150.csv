https://openalex.org/W2939132785,"The mechanism of exosomes derived from activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) involved in liver fibrosis is poorly understood. We previously reported that hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (Hif-1) regulated HSC activation, and, therefore, we investigated in current work whether Hif-1 regulates exosome secretion and the metabolic switch of HSCs, thus affecting the metabolism of liver nonparenchymal cells. In this study, the characteristics of exosomes from HSCs were assessed via electron microscopy, Western blot analysis, and acetylcholinesterase activity. Confocal microscopy was used to measure the uptake of exosomes by quiescent HSCs, Kupffer cells (KCs), and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Hif-1α was inhibited via 2-ME or specific small interfering RNAs to investigate its role in exosomes derived from HSCs. It was determined that glucose transporter 1 and pyruvate kinase M2 were increasingly expressed in fibrotic liver samples, cell lysates, and exosomes derived from activated HSCs. Exosomes released from HSCs were associated with activation and glucose uptake of HSCs. Delivery of exosomes from activated HSCs induced glycolysis of quiescent HSCs, KCs, and LSECs. Disruption of Hif-1 expression suppressed the glycolysis effect delivered by exosomes. Conclusively, our results demonstrated that exosomes secreted by activated HSCs affect the metabolic switch of liver nonparenchymal cells via delivery of glycolysis-related proteins. These findings represent a novel mechanism that contributes to liver fibrosis and has significant implications for new diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases.-Wan, L., Xia, T., Du, Y., Liu, J., Xie, Y., Zhang, Y., Guan, F., Wu, J., Wang, X., Shi, C. Exosomes from activated hepatic stellate cells contain GLUT1 and PKM2: a role for exosomes in metabolic switch of liver nonparenchymal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2939501546,"As the burden of liver disease reaches epidemic levels, there is a high unmet medical need to develop robust, accurate and reproducible non-invasive methods to quantify liver tissue characteristics for use in clinical development and ultimately in clinical practice. This prospective cross-sectional study systematically examines the repeatability and reproducibility of iron-corrected T1 (cT1), T2*, and hepatic proton density fat fraction (PDFF) quantification with multiparametric MRI across different field strengths, scanner manufacturers and models. 61 adult participants with mixed liver disease aetiology and those without any history of liver disease underwent multiparametric MRI on combinations of 5 scanner models from two manufacturers (Siemens and Philips) at different field strengths (1.5T and 3T). We report high repeatability and reproducibility across different field strengths, manufacturers, and scanner models in standardized cT1 (repeatability CoV: 1.7%, bias -7.5ms, 95% LoA of -53.6 ms to 38.5 ms; reproducibility CoV 3.3%, bias 6.5 ms, 95% LoA of -76.3 to 89.2 ms) and T2* (repeatability CoV: 5.5%, bias -0.18 ms, 95% LoA -5.41 to 5.05 ms; reproducibility CoV 6.6%, bias -1.7 ms, 95% LoA -6.61 to 3.15 ms) in human measurements. PDFF repeatability (0.8%) and reproducibility (0.75%) coefficients showed high precision of this metric. Similar precision was observed in phantom measurements. Inspection of the ICC model indicated that most of the variance in cT1 could be accounted for by study participants (ICC = 0.91), with minimal contribution from technical differences. We demonstrate that multiparametric MRI is a non-invasive, repeatable and reproducible method for quantifying liver tissue characteristics across manufacturers (Philips and Siemens) and field strengths (1.5T and 3T)."
https://openalex.org/W2939227684,"Background Though several procedures of IOL implantation have been described (sutured scleral fixation, intra-scleral fixation, angle-supported anterior chamber, and anterior chamber or retropupillary iris-claw IOLs), there are no randomized trials which are comparing different techniques. Hence, the surgical treatment of aphakia still remains controversial and challenging. The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term efficacy and the rate of complications of anterior versus posterior Iris-claw intraocular lenses (IOL) implantation to correct for the treatment of aphakia without sufficient capsule support. Methods and findings Consecutive eyes having secondary implantation of aphakic iris-fixated IOLs with a follow-up of at least 5 years were considered. Mean correct distance visual acuity (CDVA) changes, percentage of eyes with CDVA improvement, mean corneal endothelial cell density (CECD) loss and the rate of other complications were used for statistical analysis. The study evaluated a total of 180 eyes (Group A: 87 anterior chamber iris-claw fixation, Group B: 93 retropupillary iris-claw implantation) of 180 consecutive different patients, with aphakia of various reasons. CDVA improved significantly in both groups after surgery (P<0.001, ANOVA), and was remarkably higher than baseline in both groups from first week and during the entire follow-up (P<0.001, Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference). There was no statistically significant difference in CDVA between the two groups during each follow-up visits (P = NS, unpaired t-test) and in the CDVA improvement percentage between the two groups (P = 0.882, Chi-square test). No significant changes in CECD were noted after surgery in both groups (ANOVA Group A: P = 0.067, Group B: P = 0.330P). No intra-operative complications occurred in both groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of complications between the two groups (P = NS, Chi-square test), except for pigment precipitates which were higher in Group A (P<0.05, Chi-square test). Conclusions Five-year follow-up shows that secondary implantation of aphakic IOLs is effective and safe for the correction treatment of aphakia in eyes without capsule support."

Since mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been implicated in muscle atrophy, we examined whether ω-3 supplementation could mitigate disuse-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. Healthy young women (age = 22 ± 3 yr) randomly received control (n = 9) or ω-3 supplementation (n = 11; 3 g eicosapentaenoic acid, 2 g docosahexaenoic acid) for 4 wk prior to and throughout 2 wk of single-limb immobilization. Biopsies were performed before and after 3 and 14 d of immobilization for the assessment of mitochondrial respiration, H2O2 emission, and markers of ADP transport/lipid metabolism. In controls, immobilization rapidly (3 d) reduced (∼20%) ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration without altering ADP sensitivity or the abundance of mitochondrial proteins. Extending immobilization to 14 d did not further reduce mitochondrial coupled respiration; however, unlike following 3 d, mitochondrial proteins were reduced ∼20%. In contrast, ω-3 supplementation prevented immobilization-induced reductions in mitochondrial content and respiration throughout the immobilization period. Regardless of dietary supplement, immobilization did not alter mitochondrial H2O2 emission in the presence or absence of ADP, markers of cellular redox state, mitochondrial lipid–supported respiration, or lipid-related metabolic proteins. These data highlight the rapidity of mitochondrial adaptations in response to muscle disuse, challenge the necessity for increased oxidative stress during inactivity, and establish that ω-3 supplementation preserves oxidative phosphorylation function and content during immobilization.—Miotto, P. M., McGlory, C., Bahniwal, R., Kamal, M., Phillips, S. M., Holloway, G. P.

https://openalex.org/W2935847147,"Poor solute transport through the cartilage endplate (CEP) impairs disc nutrition and could be a key factor that limits the success of intradiscal biologic therapies. Here we demonstrate that treating the CEP with matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) reduces the matrix constituents that impede solute uptake and thereby improves nutrient diffusion. Human CEP tissues harvested from four fresh cadaveric lumbar spines (age range: 38–66 years old) were treated with MMP-8. Treatment caused a dose-dependent reduction in sGAG, localized reductions to the amount of collagen, and alterations to collagen structure. These matrix modifications corresponded with 16–24% increases in the uptake of a small solute (376 Da). Interestingly, the effects of MMP-8 treatment depended on the extent of non-enzymatic glycation: treated CEPs with high concentrations of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) exhibited the lowest uptake compared to treated CEPs with low concentrations of AGEs. Moreover, AGE concentrations were donor-specific, and the donor tissues with the highest AGE concentrations appeared to have lower uptake than would be expected based on the initial amounts of collagen and sGAG. Finally, increasing solute uptake in the CEP improved cell viability inside diffusion chambers, which supports the nutritional relevance of enhancing the transport properties of the CEP. Taken together, our results provide new insights and in vitro proof-of-concept for a treatment approach that could improve disc nutrition for biologic therapy: specifically, matrix reduction by MMP-8 can enhance solute uptake and nutrient diffusion through the CEP, and AGE concentration appears to be an important, patient-specific factor that influences the efficacy of this approach."
https://openalex.org/W2935978034,"The lower cell survival and retention in the hostile microenvironment after transplantation has been implicated as a major bottleneck in the advancement of stem cell therapy for myocardial infarction (MI). In this study, we designed a novel self-assembling peptide (SAP) by attaching prosurvival peptide QHREDGS derived from angiopoeitin-1 to the known SAP, RADA16-I. The mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were harvested from male rats and cytoprotective effect of this designer SAP (DSAP) on cultured MSCs was detected by Hoechst 33342 staining after being exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). The cytoprotective effect of MSCs seeded in DSAP (DSAP-MSCs) on OGD treated cardiomyocytes was examined by TUNEL staining, phosphorylated (p-) protein kinase B (Akt) level, and ELISA. The therapeutic potential of MSC transplantation carried in DSAP was evaluated in a female rat MI model. PBS, MSCs alone, MSCs seeded in SAP (SAP-MSCs), or DSAP-MSCs were transplanted into the border of the infarcted area, respectively. DSAP not only increased the proliferation of MSCs and decreased apoptosis of MSCs after OGD treatment but also promoted the secretion of IGF-1 and HGF in MSCs. Treatment with culture supernatant of DSAP-MSCs markedly reduced the percentage of apoptotic cardiomyocytes and increased the level of p-Akt. Compared with the MSC group and SAP-MSC group, DSAP-MSC injection improved cardiac function and reduced infarct size, collagen content, and cell apoptosis. The number of Y chromosome–positive cells and microvessels in the DSAP-MSC group was higher than those in the MSC group and SAP-MSC group. Moreover, DSAP-MSC transplantation down-regulated the expression of IL-6 and IL-1β and up-regulated the level of VEGF and HGF. Interestingly, miR-21 was enriched in DSAP-MSC-derived exosomes (DSAP-MSC-Exos) and the protection against cardiomyocyte apoptosis by DSAP-MSC-Exos was inhibited when miR-21 was knocked down. Furthermore, miR-21 contributed to the improvement of cardiac function after DSAP-MSC-Exo injection in a rat model of MI. Additionally, the combination of DSAP and cardiotrophin-1 (Ctf1) pretreatment further improved the survival of MSCs and the efficiency of MSC transplantation. We proposed QHREDGS-modified SAP as an effective cell delivery system and demonstrated that MSC transplantation in this DSAP promoted angiogenesis and paracrine, thereby reducing scar size and cell apoptosis as well as improving cardiac function probably via exosome-mediated miR-21 after MI. Furthermore, for the first time, we proposed that DSAP, especially working together with Ctf1 pretreatment, could be a valuable way to improve the survival of MSCs and the efficiency of MSC transplantation after MI.—Cai, H., Wu, F.-Y., Wang, Q.-L., Xu, P., Mou, F.-F., Shao, S.-J., Luo, Z.-R., Zhu, J., Xuan, S.-S., Lu, R., Guo, H.-D.

https://openalex.org/W2936691554,"Globally, over 400,000 neonatal deaths in 2015 were attributed to sepsis, however, the incidence and etiologies of these infections are largely unknown in low-middle income countries. We aimed to determine incidence and etiology of community-acquired early-onset (<72 hours age) sepsis (EOS) using culture and molecular diagnostics.This was a prospective observational study, in which we conducted a surveillance for pathogens using a combination of blood culture and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test. Blood culture was performed on all neonates with suspected EOS. Among the subset fulfilling criteria for protocol-defined EOS, blood and nasopharyngeal (NP) respiratory swabs were tested by quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR using a Taqman Array Card (TAC) with 15 bacterial and 12 viral targets. Blood and NP samples from 312 healthy newborns were also tested by TAC to estimate background positivity rates. We used variant latent-class methods to attribute etiologies and calculate pathogen-specific proportions and incidence rates.We enrolled 2,624 neonates with suspected EOS and from these 1,231 newborns met criteria for protocol-defined EOS (incidence- 39.3/1,000 live-births). Using the partially latent-class modelling, only 26.7% cases with protocol-defined EOS had attributable etiology, and the largest pathogen proportion were Ureaplasma spp. (5.4%; 95%CI: 3.6-8.0) and group B Streptococcus (GBS) (4.8%; 95%CI: 4.1-5.8), and no etiology was attributable for 73.3% of cases. Blood cultures were positive in 99/1,231 (8.0%) with protocol-defined EOS (incidence- 3.2/1,000 live-births). Leading pathogens on blood culture included GBS (35%) and viridans streptococci (24%). Ureaplasma spp. was the most common organism identified on TAC among cases with protocol-defined EOS.Using a combination of blood culture and a PCR-based test the common pathogens isolated in neonates with sepsis were Ureaplasma spp. and GBS. Despite documenting higher rates of protocol-defined EOS and using a combination of tests, the etiology for EOS remains elusive."
https://openalex.org/W2939857556,"Campylobacter jejuni is a microaerophilic bacterial species which is a major food-borne pathogen worldwide. Attachment and biofilm formation have been suggested to contribute to the survival of this fastidious bacteria in the environment. In this study the attachment of three C. jejuni strains (C. jejuni strains 2868 and 2871 isolated from poultry and ATCC 33291) to different abiotic surfaces (stainless steel, glass and polystyrene) alone or with Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms on them, in air at 25°C and under static or flow conditions, were investigated using a modified Robbins Device. Bacteria were enumerated and scanning electron microscopy was carried out. The results indicated that both C. jejuni strains isolated from poultry attached better to Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms on abiotic surfaces than to the surfaces alone under the different conditions tested. This suggests that biofilms of other bacterial species may passively protect C. jejuni against shear forces and potentially oxygen stress which then contribute to their persistence in environments which are detrimental to them. By contrast the C. jejuni ATCC 33291 strain did not attach differentially to P. aeruginosa biofilms, suggesting that different C. jejuni strains may have alternative strategies for persistence in the environment. This study supports the hypothesis that C. jejuni do not form biofilms per se under conditions they encounter in the environment but simply attach to surfaces or biofilms of other species."

However, lack of empirical data on long-ranging carnivores may lead to erroneous decisions in formulating management plans. The Indian Grey wolf (Canis lupus pallipes) is known to be distributed in the vast areas of the Indian subcontinent. However, the actual population estimates are available only for Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Bihar. Whereas, its distribution, population and habitat ecology is poorly known from the eastern region. Hence, this article aimed to evaluate the habitat suitability along with landscape connectivity for the species over the two major biogeographic provinces of India, i.e., Lower Gangetic Plains (7b) and Chhota Nagpur Plateau (6b). The present model with significantly higher Area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.981, indicates its accuracy in predicting the suitable habitats and identifying biological corridors by using environmental, topological and anthropogenic variables. Precipitation of the driest quarter and the precipitation of seasonality were the two best performing variables in our model, capable of explaining about 26% and 22.4% variation in the data respectively. Out of the total area i.e. 4,16,665 Km2, about 18,237 Km2 (4.37%) was found to be highly suitable area and about 3,16,803 Km2 (76.03%) areas as least suitable. The corridor analysis indicated that the habitat connectivity was highest in the border line area of the two biotic provinces located in the south-eastern zone via districts of Purba Singhbhum and Paschim Singhbhum of Jharkhand state and Bankura and West Midnapore districts of West Bengal state. Among the Protected Areas (PAs), natural corridors exist connecting the Simlipal National Park (NP)-Satkosia Wildlife Santuray (WLS), Dalma ranges of Chotta Nagpur plateau along with Badrama WLS, Khulasuni WLS and Debrigarh WLS. Differential management through landscape level planning may be helpful in securing the future of the species in the landscape."
https://openalex.org/W2936328099,"Although the mouse strain Murphy Roths Large (MRL/MpJ) possesses high regenerative potential, the mechanism of tissue regeneration, including skeletal muscle, in MRL/MpJ mice after injury is still unclear. Our previous studies have shown that muscle-derived stem/progenitor cell (MDSPC) function is significantly enhanced in MRL/MpJ mice when compared with MDSPCs isolated from age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. Using mass spectrometry–based proteomic analysis, we identified increased expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1α target genes (expression of glycolytic factors and antioxidants) in sera from MRL/MpJ mice compared with WT mice. Therefore, we hypothesized that HIF-1α promotes the high muscle healing capacity of MRL/MpJ mice by increasing the potency of MDSPCs. We demonstrated that treating MRL/MpJ MDSPCs with dimethyloxalylglycine and CoCl2 increased the expression of HIF-1α and target genes, including angiogenic and cell survival genes. We also observed that HIF-1α activated the expression of paired box (Pax)7 through direct interaction with the Pax7 promoter. Furthermore, we also observed a higher myogenic potential of MDSPCs derived from prolyl hydroxylase (Phd) 3—knockout (Phd3−/−) mice, which displayed higher stability of HIF-1α. Taken together, our findings suggest that HIF-1α is a major determinant in the increased MDSPC function of MRL/MpJ mice through enhancement of cell survival, proliferation, and myogenic differentiation.—Sinha, K.

https://openalex.org/W2937959455,"A project named PERSISTAH (Projetos de Escolas Resilientes aos SISmos no Território do Algarve e de Huelva, in Portuguese) is being developed. It aims to cooperatively assess and improve the seismic vulnerability of primary schools in the Algarve (Portugal) and Huelva (Spain). A large number of schools have to be analysed. In order to determine which seismic retrofitting technique is optimal, an index-based method is presented in this paper. It considers three parameters: first, the efficiency of the seismic retrofitting technique in relation to the structural improvement obtained; second, the cost of the implementation of the retrofitting technique; and third, the architectural impact. It should be mentioned that a specific measurement for each solution according to its geometry has been performed. Also, coefficients to consider the singularities of each analysis and the importance of the parameters (number of buildings, typology, available funds, etc.) in the study are considered. The most representative primary school of Huelva has been chosen to test the index-based method. The most suitable retrofitting techniques for this type of buildings have been tested. The retrofitting technique which most increased the seismic performance has been the addition of X and V bracings within the building’s bays. Furthermore, the analyses have revealed that adding the retrofitting elements in the most vulnerable direction of the building provides a high efficiency. The results have also shown that implementing techniques of lower architectural impact gives acceptable results. The analysis of the mean damage level index has shown that the building would experiment a severe damage. All the retrofitting techniques applied have reduced it, at least, up to moderate damage. Finally, it should be noted that the position of the retrofitting elements is also paramount for providing an optimal retrofitting."
https://openalex.org/W2939546371,"Multigene families of CKX genes encode cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase proteins (CKX), which regulate cytokinin content in organs of developing plants. It has already been documented that some of them play important roles in plant productivity. The presented research is the first step of comprehensive characterization of the bread wheat TaCKX gene family with the goal to select genes determining yield-related traits. The specificity of expression patterns of fifteen formerly annotated members of the TaCKX family was tested in different organs during wheat development. Based on this, the genes were assigned to four groups: TaCKX10, TaCKX5 and TaCKX4, highly specific to leaves; TaCKX3, TaCKX6 and TaCKX11, expressed in various levels through all the organs tested; TaCKX1, TaCKX2.3, TaCKX2.2, TaCKX2.1, TaCKX2.4 and TaCKX2.5 specific to developing spikes and inflorescences; TaCKX9, TaCKX8 and TaCKX7, highly specific to roots. Amplification products of tested genes were mapped to the chromosomes of the A, B or D genome using T. aestivum Ensembl Plants. Based on analysis of TaCKX transcripts as well as encoded amino acids in T. aestivum and Hordeum vulgare the number of CKX genes in wheat was limited to 11 and new numbering of selected TaCKX genes was proposed. Moreover, we found that there were developmental differences in expression of TaCKX in the first and the second spike and expression of some of the genes was daily time dependent. A very high and significant correlation was found between expression levels of TaCKX7 and TaCKX9, genes specific to seedling roots, TaCKX1, TaCKX2.1 and TaCKX2.2, specific to developing spikes, and the group of TaCKX3, 4, 5, 6, 10 and 11, highly expressed in leaves and other organs. The genes also co-operated among organs and were included in two groups representing younger or maturating stages of developing plants. The first group was represented by seedling roots, leaves from 4-week old plants, inflorescences and 0 DAP spikes; the second by developing spikes, 0 DAP, 7 DAP and 14 DAP. The key genes which might determine yield-related traits are indicated and their possible roles in breeding strategies are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2935964633,"Snow dynamics influence seasonal behaviors of wildlife, such as denning patterns and habitat selection related to the availability of food resources. Under a changing climate, characteristics of the temporal and spatial patterns of snow are predicted to change, and as a result, there is a need to better understand how species interact with snow dynamics. This study examines grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) spring habitat selection and use across western Alberta, Canada. Made possible by newly available fine-scale snow cover data, this research tests a hypothesis that grizzly bears select for locations with less snow cover and areas where snow melts sooner during spring (den emergence to May 31st). Using Integrated Step Selection Analysis, a series of models were built to examine whether snow cover information such as fractional snow covered area and date of snow melt improved models constructed based on previous knowledge of grizzly bear selection during the spring. Comparing four different models fit to 62 individual bear-years, we found that the inclusion of fractional snow covered area improved model fit 60% of the time based on Akaike Information Criterion tallies. Probability of use was then used to evaluate grizzly bear habitat use in response to snow and environmental attributes, including fractional snow covered area, date since snow melt, elevation, and distance to road. Results indicate grizzly bears select for lower elevation, snow-free locations during spring, which has important implications for management of threatened grizzly bear populations in consideration of changing climatic conditions. This study is an example of how fine spatial and temporal scale remote sensing data can be used to improve our understanding of wildlife habitat selection and use in relation to key environmental attributes."
https://openalex.org/W2949124459,"Measuring whole-brain functional connectivity patterns based on task-free ('resting-state') spontaneous fluctuations in the functional MRI (fMRI) signal is a standard approach to probing habitual brain states, independent of task-specific context. This view is supported by spatial correspondence between task- and rest-derived connectivity networks. Yet, it remains unclear whether intrinsic connectivity observed in a resting-state acquisition is persistent during task. Here, we sought to determine how changes in ongoing brain activation, elicited by task performance, impact the integrity of whole-brain functional connectivity patterns (commonly termed 'resting state networks'). We employed a 'steady-states' paradigm, in which participants continuously executed a specific task (without baseline periods). Participants underwent separate task-based (visual, motor and visuomotor) or task-free (resting) steady-state scans, each performed over a 5-minute period. This unique design allowed us to apply a set of traditional resting-state analyses to various task-states. In addition, a classical fMRI block-design was employed to identify individualized brain activation patterns for each task, allowing us to characterize how differing activation patterns across the steady-states impact whole-brain intrinsic connectivity patterns. By examining correlations across segregated brain regions (nodes) and the whole brain (using independent component analysis) using standard resting-state functional connectivity (FC) analysis, we show that the whole-brain network architecture characteristic of the resting-state is comparable across different steady-task states, despite striking inter-task changes in brain activation (signal amplitude). Changes in functional connectivity were detected locally, within the active networks. But to identify these local changes, the contributions of different FC networks to the global intrinsic connectivity pattern had to be isolated. Together, we show that intrinsic connectivity underlying the canonical resting-state networks is relatively stable even when participants are engaged in different tasks and is not limited to the resting-state."
https://openalex.org/W2936721907,"The Burmese python (Python bivittatus) is now established as a breeding population throughout south Florida, USA. However, the extent of the invasion, and the ecological impacts of this novel apex predator on animal communities are incompletely known, in large part because Burmese pythons (hereafter “pythons”) are extremely cryptic and there has been no efficient way to detect them. Pythons are recently confirmed nest predators of long-legged wading bird breeding colonies (orders Ciconiiformes and Pelecaniformes). Pythons can consume large quantities of prey and may not be recognized as predators by wading birds, therefore they could be a particular threat to colonies. To quantify python occupancy rates at tree islands where wading birds breed, we utilized environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis—a genetic tool which detects shed DNA in water samples and provides high detection probabilities. We fitted multi-scale Bayesian occupancy models to test the prediction that pythons occupy islands with wading bird colonies at higher rates compared to representative control islands containing no breeding birds. Our results suggest that pythons are widely distributed across the central Everglades in proximity to active wading bird colonies. In support of our prediction that pythons are attracted to colonies, site-level python eDNA occupancy rates were higher at wading bird colonies (ψ = 0.88, 95% credible interval [0.59–1.00]) than at the control islands (ψ = 0.42 [0.16–0.80]) in April through June (n = 15 colony-control pairs). We found our water temperature proxy (time of day) to be informative of detection probability, in accordance with other studies demonstrating an effect of temperature on eDNA degradation in occupied samples. Individual sample concentrations ranged from 0.26 to 38.29 copies/μL and we generally detected higher concentrations of python eDNA in colony sites. Continued monitoring of wading bird colonies is warranted to determine the effect pythons are having on populations and investigate putative management activities."
https://openalex.org/W2935879564,"Introduction Safety climate, which provides a snapshot of safety culture, is rarely measured in Indonesian healthcare organisations because there are no validated surveys that can be administered in its native language, Bahasa Indonesia. The objectives of this study were to translate and linguistically adapt the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire into Bahasa Indonesia, and investigate the internal construct validity and reliability of the translated survey. Methods The Safety Attitudes Questionnaire was translated into Indonesian language through forward and backward translation. The internal construct validity and reliability of the translated survey was assessed using Rasch analysis which examines overall model fit, unidimensionality, response format, targeting, internal consistency reliability and item bias. Results A total of 279 nurses (response rate 82%) completed the Indonesian version of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire. Most respondents were Division 2 registered nurses (n = 209; 75%), female (n = 174; 62%), and aged less than 30 years (n = 187; 67%). All six domains of the Indonesian version of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire demonstrated unidimensionality (t-test less than 0.05 threshold value). However, suboptimal targeting (ceiling effect) was observed in all domains, and had at least one misfitting item (item fit residual beyond ±2.5) Item bias was also evident in most domains. Conclusion This study has translated and validated an Indonesian version of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire for the first time. Whilst there was general support to sum items to obtain domain scores, further work is required to refine the response options as well as the wording and number of items in this survey to improve its overall measurement properties."
https://openalex.org/W2935896247,"An image classification algorithm based on adaptive feature weight updating is proposed to address the low classification accuracy of the current single-feature classification algorithms and simple multifeature fusion algorithms. The MapReduce parallel programming model on the Hadoop platform is used to perform an adaptive fusion of hue, local binary pattern (LBP) and scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) features extracted from images to derive optimal combinations of weights. The support vector machine (SVM) classifier is then used to perform parallel training to obtain the optimal SVM classification model, which is then tested. The Pascal VOC 2012, Caltech 256 and SUN databases are adopted to build a massive image library. The speedup, classification accuracy and training time are tested in the experiment, and the results show that a linear growth tendency is present in the speedup of the system in a cluster environment. In consideration of the hardware costs, time, performance and accuracy, the algorithm is superior to mainstream classification algorithms, such as the power mean SVM and convolutional neural network (CNN). As the number and types of images both increase, the classification accuracy rate exceeds 95%. When the number of images reaches 80,000, the training time of the proposed algorithm is only 1/5 that of traditional single-node architecture algorithms. This result reflects the effectiveness of the algorithm, which provides a basis for the effective analysis and processing of image big data."
https://openalex.org/W2938084012,"Amblyosyllis is a worldwide distributed group of annelids mainly found in coastal environments. It is well known among the polychaete specialists mostly because of its notable beauty, showing bright colourful patterns and outstanding long and coiled appendices. Amblyosyllis is a monophyletic genus easy to identify due to its distinct diagnostic features; however, the species and their boundaries are, in most cases, not well defined. Herein, we provide an extensive sample of Amblyosyllis material (115 specimens) from several world geographic areas. We have studied the morphological features of each specimen and photographed them alive. Two mitochondrial DNA markers (COI and 16S) and one nuclear gene fragment (28S, D1 region) were sequenced. We performed phylogenetic analyses based on each DNA partition, as well as the combined data sets, obtaining congruent results. Species delimitation methods such as distance analyses, statistical parsimony networks and multi-rate Poisson tree processes were also applied. The combined results obtained from different methodologies and data sets are used to differentiate between, at least, 19 lineages compatible with the separately evolving meta-populations species concept. Four of these lineages are identified as nominal species, including the type species of Amblyosyllis, A. rhombeata. For three other lineages previously synonymized names are recovered, and seven lineages are described as new species. All of these species are described and supported by appropriate iconography. We recognize several morphological characters useful to identify species of Amblyosyllis, which in some cases should also be combined with molecular methods for species delineation. The genetic divergence in the genus is high, contrary to the morphological homogeneity observed. Two species show a wide geographical distribution, while the rest have a more restricted distribution. There are several examples of species with overlapping distribution patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2938906210,"Urine of prostate cancer (PCa) carries miRNAs originated from prostate cancer cells as a part of both nucleoprotein complexes and cell-secreted extracellular vesicles. The analysis of such miRNA-markers in urine can be a convenient option for PCa screening. The aims of this study were to reveal miRNA–markers of PCa in urine and design a robust and precise diagnostic test, based on miRNA expression analysis. The expression analysis of the 84 miRNAs in paired urine extracellular vesicles (EVs) and cell free urine supernatant samples from healthy donors, patients with benign and malignant prostate tumours was done using miRCURY LNA miRNA qPCR Panels (Exiqon, Denmark). Sets of miRNAs differentially expressed between the donor groups were found in urine EVs and urine supernatant. Diagnostically significant miRNAs were selected and algorithm of data analysis, based on expression data on 24-miRNA in urine and obtained using 17 analytical systems, was designed. The developed algorithm of data analysis describes a series of steps necessary to define cut-off values and sequentially analyze miRNA expression data according to the cut-offs to facilitate classification of subjects in case/control groups and allows to detect PCa patients with 97.5% accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2937312565,"Dysferlinopathies are a form of muscular dystrophy caused by gene mutations resulting in deficiency of the protein dysferlin. Symptoms manifest later in life in a muscle specific manner, although the pathomechanism is not well understood. This study compared the impact of dysferlin-deficiency on in vivo and ex vivo muscle function, and myofibre type composition in slow (soleus) and fast type (extensor digitorum longus; EDL) muscles using male dysferlin-deficient (dysf-/-) BLAJ mice aged 10 months, compared with wild type (WT) C57Bl/6J mice. There was a striking increase in muscle mass of BLAJ soleus (+25%) (p<0.001), with no strain differences in EDL mass, compared with WT. In vivo measures of forelimb grip strength and wheel running capacity showed no strain differences. Ex vivo measures showed the BLAJ soleus had faster twitch contraction (-21%) and relaxation (-20%) times, and delayed post fatigue recovery (ps<0.05); whereas the BLAJ EDL had a slower relaxation time (+11%) and higher maximum rate of force production (+25%) (ps<0.05). Similar proportions of MHC isoforms were evident in the soleus muscles of both strains (ps>0.05); however, for the BLAJ EDL, there was an increased proportion of type IIx MHC isoform (+5.5%) and decreased type IIb isoform (-5.5%) (ps<0.01). This identification of novel differences in the impact of dysferlin-deficiency on slow and fast twitch muscles emphasises the importance of evaluating myofibre type specific effects to provide crucial insight into the mechanisms responsible for loss of function in dysferlinopathies; this is critical for the development of targeted future clinical therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2937813623,"Despite an increase in incidence, treatments for hepatoblastoma remain virtually unchanged for the past 20 years, emphasizing the need for novel therapeutics. FTY720 (fingolimod) is an immunomodulator approved for use in multiple sclerosis in children that has been demonstrated to have anti-cancer properties in multiple cancer types. We have demonstrated that FTY720 activates PP2A in hepatoblastoma, but does not do so via inhibition of the endogenous inhibitors, CIP2A and I2PP2A, as previously observed in other cancers. PP2A activation in hepatoblastoma decreased cell viability, proliferation, and motility and induced apoptosis. In a subcutaneous xenograft model, FTY720 decreased tumor growth. FTY720 in combination with the standard chemotherapeutic, cisplatin, decreased proliferation in a synergistic manner. Finally, animals bearing subcutaneous hepatoblastoma xenografts treated with FTY720 and cisplatin in combination had significantly decreased tumor growth compared to those treated with either drug alone. These findings show that targeting PP2A with FTY70 shows promise in the treatment of hepatoblastoma and that combining FTY720 with cisplatin may be a novel and effective strategy to better treat this devastating pediatric liver tumor."
https://openalex.org/W2939201741,"Latinx in the United States have greater life expectancy than other groups, in spite of their socioeconomic and psychosocial disadvantage. This phenomenon has been described as the Latinx health paradox. This investigation observed the interplay of cultural processes and social networks to shed light on this paradox. Latina (N = 26) and White-European (N = 24) mothers wore a digital recorder as they went about their daily lives. Four conversation styles were characterized from the recordings to measure the mothers’ quality of their conversations (small talk and substantive conversations) within different social networks (with the father vs. other adults). As a positive indicator of well-being, laughter was assessed during the conversations. Results demonstrated that Latina mothers tend to laugh more than White-European mothers; and that this relation is mediated by substantive conversations with others. This suggests that Latinas’ cultural processes afford meaningful conversations, which relates to more behavioral laughter, a process that may have positive implications on well-being."
https://openalex.org/W2940376409,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) is over-expressed and hyperactivated in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and plays a role in ensuring the correct alignment of chromosomes on the metaphase plate during mitosis through regulation of microtubule stability. This makes the enzyme an attractive target for cancer therapy. We examined the effects of a selective cell-permeant GSK3 inhibitor (CHIR99021), used alone or in combination with paclitaxel, using an in vitro cell growth assay, a quantitative chromosome alignment assay, and a tumor xenograft model. CHIR99021 inhibits the growth of human H1975 and H1299 NSCLC cell lines in a synergistic manner with paclitaxel. CHIR99021 and paclitaxel promoted a synergistic defect in chromosomal alignment when compared to each compound administered as monotherapy. Furthermore, we corroborated our in vitro findings in a mouse tumor xenograft model. Our results demonstrate that a GSK3 inhibitor and paclitaxel act synergistically to inhibit the growth of NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo via a mechanism that may involve converging modes of action on microtubule spindle stability and thus chromosomal alignment during metaphase. Our findings provide novel support for the use of the GSK3 inhibitor, CHIR99021, alongside taxol-based chemotherapy in the treatment of human lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2937463543,"Information on alcohol consumption in patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of atrial fibrillation (AF) is often limited by the reliance on self-reports. The aim of this study was to describe the long-term alcohol consumption, measured as ethyl glucuronide in hair (hEtG), in patients undergoing RFA due to AF, and to examine potential associations with cardiac biomarkers, left atrial size and re-ablation within one year after the initial RFA.The amount of hEtG was measured in patients referred for RFA, and a cut-off of 7 pg/mg was used. N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and the mid-regional fragment of pro atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) were examined and maximum left atrium volume index (LAVI) was measured. The number of re-ablations was examined up to one year after the initial RFA. Analyses were stratified by gender, and adjusted for age, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, presence of heart failure and heart rhythm for analyses regarding NT-proBNP, MR-proANP and LAVI and heart rhythm being replaced by type of AF for analyses regarding re-ablation.In total, 192 patients were included in the study. Median (25th- 75th percentile) NT-proBNP in men with hEtG ≥ 7 vs. < 7 pg/mg was 250 (96-695) vs. 130 (49-346) pg/ml (p = 0.010), and in women it was 230 (125-480) vs. 230 (125-910) pg/ml (p = 0.810). Median MR-proANP in men with hEtG ≥ 7 vs. < 7 pg/mg was 142 (100-224) vs. 117 (83-179) pmol/l (p = 0.120) and in women it was 139 (112-206) vs. 153 (93-249) pmol/l (p = 0.965). The median of maximum LAVI was 30.1 (26.7-33.9) vs. 25.8 (21.4-32.0) ml/m2 (p = 0.017) in men, and 25.0 (18.9-29.6) vs. 25.7 (21.7-34.6) ml/m2 (p = 0.438) in women, with hEtG ≥ 7 vs. < 7 pg/ml, respectively. Adjusted analyses showed similar results, except for MR-proANP turning out significant in men with hEtG ≥ 7 vs. < 7 pg/mg (p = 0.047). The odds ratio of having a re-ablation was 3.5 (95% CI 1.3-9.6, p = 0.017) in men with hEtG ≥ 7 vs. < 7 pg/mg, while there was no significant difference in women.In male patients with AF and hEtG ≥ 7 pg/mg, NT-proBNP and MR-proANP were higher, LA volumes larger, and there was a higher rate of re-ablations, as compared to men with hEtG < 7 pg/mg. This implies that men with an alcohol consumption corresponding to an hEtG-value ≥ 7, have a higher risk for LA remodelling that could potentially lead to a deterioration of the AF situation."
https://openalex.org/W2938943094,"To accommodate small fluid volumes, repackaging of intravenous lipid emulsions is frequently performed in hospitals providing parenteral nutrition to neonates and smaller pediatric patients. The physical stability of lipid commercial parenteral emulsions repacked and stored in polypropylene syringe up to 30 days at room temperature, refrigerator and 40°C was determined to establish options for extended storage. Lipid emulsions in the manufacturers' original containers were used as references. Commercial lipid emulsions (20% of oil phase), ClinOleic, Intralipid, Smoflipid, Omegaven and Lipofindin LCT/MCT were repackaged under aseptic conditions in polypropylene syringes and stored at 4°C, 25°C and 40°C without light protection. Samples were assayed periodically over 30 days using validated, stability-indicating methods. Lipid emulsions in the manufacturers' containers stored in the same conditions were as references. Analysis of variance showed differences in the physical parameters due to temperature (p<0.05) and study day (p<0.05) but not the type of the emulsion (p = 0.98). The parenteral lipid emulsions in polypropylene syringe exhibited identical (except Z-avarage at 40°C, t = 30 days) to original containers time-dependent behavior taking into account the mean globule size, pH, and zeta potential measurements. Size of oily droplets of all test conditions remained below the United States Pharmacopeia limits. The results allow safe repacking of commercial lipid emulsion in a syringe, which is a necessary condition for supplying parenteral nutrition using the two-in-one method for newborns. However, longer storage than 12 h of repacked emulsion needs microbiological studies."
https://openalex.org/W2936331439,"Multimorbidity can be defined as the co-occurrence of two or more chronic medical conditions in one person. Within the diagnostic process, accurately detecting a multimorbid disease pattern still poses a major challenge for most physicians, and is known as a source of diagnostic uncertainty.We investigated, how sensitive, confident, and accurate physicians are in diagnosing multimorbid versus monomorbid patients.We created eight video case-based vignettes, which differed in type of morbidity (multimorbid versus monomorbid), field of medical specialization (somatic versus mental), and relatedness of underlying diseases (causally related versus unrelated). In total, 74 physicians (GPs, residents in an emergency department and psychiatrists) watched three to five randomly allocated video cases and had to generate suspected diagnoses at the end of each of three video sequences. Additionally, participating physicians rated subjective confidence for all mentioned diagnoses and for three sequences per case with the help of confidence profiles.Altogether, physicians made a large number of accurate diagnoses (69%). Nevertheless, the overall number of underdiagnosed multimorbid cases (misses) was significantly higher (71%) than over-diagnosed monomorbid cases (false alarms) (7%).According to Signal Detection Theory, GPs and psychiatrists both showed lower detection performance for medical cases that lay beyond their own field of specialization. Remarkably, residents show the highest sensitivity for multimorbid cases with an approximately identically detection performance d' slightly over 1 for both field of medical specialization (somatic and mental). Furthermore, higher uncertainty in diagnosing multimorbid cases is related to lower confidence especially at the beginning of a diagnostic process, as well as to unrelated and therefore probably rare disease pattern. Several limitations of the study and the video case-based vignettes are described within the discussion section.Physicians have to be sensitized for multimorbidity even more, and have to be taught in the prevalence of existing disease combinations. Communicating uncertainty with other specialists could be helpful when faced with a sometimes ""fuzzy"" pattern of symptoms."

Recommendations for the management of advanced HIV disease include prompt screening and treatment of opportunistic infections, rapid initiation of ART and intensified adherence support. We present treatment outcomes of a cohort of patients presenting with advanced HIV disease in a semi-urban Zimbabwean polyclinic.Retrospective cohort analysis of adult patients enrolled for care at Epworth polyclinic, Zimbabwe between 2007 and end June 2016. Treatment outcomes at 6 and 12 months were recorded. Multivariate logistical regression analysis was undertaken to identify risk factors for presentation with advanced HIV Disease (CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3 or WHO stage 3 or 4) and risks for attrition at 12 months.16,007 anti-retroviral therapy naive adult patients were included in the final analysis, 47.4% of whom presented with advanced HIV disease. Patients presenting with advanced HIV disease had a higher mortality rate at 12 months following enrollment compared to early stage patients (5.11% vs 0.45%). Introduction of a package of differentiated care for patients with a CD4 count of less than 100 cells/mm3 resulted in diagnosis of cryptococcal antigenaemia in 7% of patients and a significant increase in the diagnosis of TB, although there was no significant difference in attrition at 6 or 12 months for these patients compared to those enrolled prior to the introduction of the differentiated care.The burden of advanced HIV disease remained high over the study period in this semi-urban polyclinic in Zimbabwe. Introduction of a package of differentiated care for those with advanced HIV disease increased the diagnosis of opportunistic infections and represents a model of care which can be replicated in other polyclinics in the resource constrained Zimbabwean context."
https://openalex.org/W2937636870,"While investigating the role played by de novo lipid (DNL) biosynthesis in cancer cells, we sought a medium condition that would support cell proliferation without providing any serum lipids. Here we report that a defined serum free cell culture medium condition containing insulin, transferrin and selenium (ITS) supports controlled study of transcriptional regulation of de novo fatty acid (DNFA) production and de novo cholesterol synthesis (DNCS) in melanoma cell lines. This lipid-free ITS medium is able to support continuous proliferation of several melanoma cell lines that utilize DNL to support their lipid requirements. We show that the ITS medium stimulates gene transcription in support of both DNFA and DNCS, specifically mediated by SREBP1/2 in melanoma cells. We further found that the ITS medium promoted SREBP1 nuclear localization and occupancy on DNFA gene promoters. Our data show clear utility of this serum and lipid-free medium for melanoma cancer cell culture and lipid-related areas of investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2935693026,"Measuring staff perceptions with safety climate surveys is a promising approach to addressing patient safety. Variation in safety climate scores between work sites may predict variability in risk related to tasks, work environment, staff behavior, and patient outcomes. Safety climate measurements may identify considerable variation in staff perceptions across work sites.To explore variation in staff perceptions of patient safety climate across work sites in Norwegian General Practitioner (GP) practices and Out-of-hours clinics.The Norwegian Safety Attitudes QuestionnaireAmbulatory Version (SAQ A) was used to survey staff perceptions of patient safety climate across a sample of GP practices and Out-of-hours clinics in Norway. We invited 510 primary health care providers to fill out the questionnaire anonymously online in October and November 2012. Work sites were 17 regular GP practices in Sogn & Fjordane County, and seven Out-of-hours clinics, of which six were designated as ""Watchtower Clinics"". Intra-class correlation coefficients were calculated to identify what proportion of the variation in the five factor scores (Teamwork climate, Safety climate, Job satisfaction, Perceptions of management, and Working conditions) were at work site-level.Of the 510 invited health care providers, 266 (52%) answered the questionnaire. Staff perceptions varied considerably at the work site level: intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were 12.3% or higher for all factors except for Job satisfaction-the highest ICC value was for Perceptions of management: 15.5%.Although most of the score variation was at the individual level, there was considerable response clustering within the GP practices and OOH clinics. This implies that the Norwegian SAQ A is able to identify GP practices and OOH clinics with high and low patient safety climate scores. Patient safety climate scores produced by the Norwegian version of the SAQ A may, thus, guide improvement and learning efforts to work sites according to the level of their scores."
https://openalex.org/W2939738272,"The tetraploid wheat species Triticum turgidum and Triticum timopheevii are morphologically similar, and misidentification of material collected from the wild is possible. We compared published sequences for the Ppd-A1, Ppd-B1 and Ppd-G1 genes from multiple accessions of T. turgidum and T. timopheevii and devised a set of four polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), two specific for Ppd-B1 and two for Ppd-G1. We used these PCRs with 51 accessions of T. timopheevii and 20 of T. turgidum. Sixty of these accessions gave PCR products consistent with their taxon identifications, but the other eleven accessions gave anomalous results: ten accessions that were classified as T. turgidum were identified as T. timopheevii by the PCRs, and one T. timopheevii accession was typed as T. turgidum. We believe that these anomalies are not due to errors in the PCR tests because the results agree with a more comprehensive analysis of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms, which similarly suggest that these eleven accessions have been misclassified. Our results therefore show that the accepted morphological tests for discrimination between T. turgidum and T. timopheevii might not be entirely robust, but that species identification can be made cheaply and quickly by PCRs directed at the Ppd-1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2919035815,"At the primary care setting, where there are often no or minimal laboratories, examinations often consist of self-testing and rapid diagnostics. Because of this, medical devices must be simple, robust, and easy to operate. To address these concerns, an alternate fluorescence microscope design uses ultraviolet (UV) excitation, since fluorescent dyes that are excitable in the visible region are also excitable by UV. This may allow for the removal of typical excitation, emission, and dichroic filters as optical components absorb UV wavelengths and UV is not detected by silicon based detectors. Additionally, UV has a very low penetration into samples, which may allow for controlling the depth of excitation, and thus the imaging volume. Based on these ideas, we developed a simple fluorescence microscope built completely from off-the-shelf components that uses UV to image fluorescently stained samples. The simple opto-mechanical design of the system may allow it to be more compact and easy to use, as well as decrease the overall cost of the diagnostic device. For biological validation, we imaged whole blood stained with acridine orange and performed a two-part white blood cell differential count."
https://openalex.org/W2935861710,"Humans are able to achieve visual object recognition rapidly and effortlessly. Object categorization is commonly believed to be achieved by interaction between bottom-up and top-down cognitive processing. In the ultra-rapid categorization scenario where the stimuli appear briefly and response time is limited, it is assumed that a first sweep of feedforward information is sufficient to discriminate whether or not an object is present in a scene. However, whether and how feedback/top-down processing is involved in such a brief duration remains an open question. To this end, here, we would like to examine how different top-down manipulations, such as category level, category type and real-world size, interact in ultra-rapid categorization. We have constructed a dataset comprising real-world scene images with a built-in measurement of target object display size. Based on this set of images, we have measured ultra-rapid object categorization performance by human subjects. Standard feedforward computational models representing scene features and a state-of-the-art object detection model were employed for auxiliary investigation. The results showed the influences from 1) animacy (animal, vehicle, food), 2) level of abstraction (people, sport), and 3) real-world size (four target size levels) on ultra-rapid categorization processes. This had an impact to support the involvement of top-down processing when rapidly categorizing certain objects, such as sport at a fine grained level. Our work on human vs. model comparisons also shed light on possible collaboration and integration of the two that may be of interest to both experimental and computational vision researches.

https://openalex.org/W2938392214,"Differences in stroke risk factors and treatment variables between rural and urban regions in Austria were analyzed retrospectively as European data on this topic are scarce.We performed statistical analysis using group comparisons and time series analysis of data of the Austrian Stroke Unit Registry between 2005 and 2016. 87411 patients were divided into three groups (rural, intermediate, urban) according to the degree of urbanisation classification of the European Commission/Eurostat.Patients in the rural group were significantly younger, more often female, had a lower pre-stroke disability, and were more frequently transported by an emergency physician. Vascular risk factors were significantly higher in urban patients, leading to a higher rate of microangiopathic etiology. Onset-to-door (ODT) and Onset-to-treatment times were significantly higher in the rural group, but ODTs decreased over time. Door-to-needle times and time to first vascular imaging were significantly lower in the rural group. Intravenous thrombolysis and rehabilitation rates were lower in urban patients.Contrary to previous literature predominantly from outside of Europe, vascular risk factors were higher in Austrian urban patients. Further, rural patients had higher intravenous thrombolysis and rehabilitation rates maybe because of lower pre-stroke disability. ODTs in rural patients were generally higher, but they decreased over time, which might be a consequence of better education of the public in noticing early stroke signs, better transportation and education of emergency medical personnel, better advance notification to the receiving hospital and implementation of Stroke Units in rural areas."

Mapping of cancer-associated point mutations onto this structure reveals that these amino acid substitutions are distributed throughout the SH3 domain and may affect Lyn kinase function distinctly."
https://openalex.org/W2936965310,"Joint physical custody (JPC) refers to a practice where children with separated parents share their time between the parents’ respective homes. Studies on parents’ views of JPC for young children are scarce. The aim of this interview study was to explore parents’ perceptions on how they experience and practice equally shared JPC for their 1–4 year-olds in Sweden. Forty-six parents (18 fathers and 28 mothers) of 50 children (31 boys and 19 girls) under 5 years of age were interviewed. Parents were recruited through information in the media and represented a broad range of socioeconomic backgrounds, as well as both voluntary and court-ordered custody arrangements. The interviews were semi-structured and analyzed using systematic text condensation. Two themes emerged regarding the research question. In the first theme, Always free, never free, parents described their striving to coparent without a love relationship. While they appreciated the freedom of being a “half-time parent”, doing things one’s own way, they felt constrained by the long-term commitment to live close to and keep discussing child rearing issues with the ex-partner. Good communication was key and lessened parent’s feelings of being cut-off from half of the child’s life. When JPC was ordered by court or conflicts were intense, parents tried to have less contact and worried when the children were in the other home. The second theme, Is it right, is it good?, included descriptions of how the parents monitored the child’s responses to the living arrangement and made changes to optimize their adjustment. Adaptations included visits for the child with the other parent mid-week, shared meals or adapting schedules. In conclusion, these parents worked hard to make JPC work and cause minimal damage to their children. Most parents were pleased with the arrangements with the notable exception of couples experiencing ongoing conflict."
https://openalex.org/W2938196938,"Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen that causes listeriosis and can lead to serious clinical problems, such as sepsis and meningitis, in immunocompromised patients and neonates. Due to a growing number of antibiotic-resistant L. monocytogenes strains, listeriosis can steadily become refractory to antibiotic treatment. To develop novel therapeutics against listeriosis, the drug resistance mechanism of L. monocytogenes needs to be determined. The transcription factor LftR from L. monocytogenes regulates the expression of a putative multidrug resistance transporter, LieAB, and belongs to the PadR-2 subfamily of the PadR family. Despite the functional significance of LftR, our molecular understanding of the transcriptional regulatory mechanism for LftR and even for the PadR-2 subfamily is highly limited. Here, we report the crystal structure of LftR, which forms a dimer and protrudes two winged helix-turn-helix motifs for DNA recognition. Structure-based mutational and comparative analyses showed that LftR interacts with operator DNA through a LftR-specific mode as well as a common mechanism used by the PadR family. Moreover, the LftR dimer harbors one intersubunit cavity in the center of the dimeric structure as a putative ligand-binding site. Finally, conformational flexibilities in the LftR dimer and in the cavity suggest that a ligand-induced regulatory mechanism would be used by the LftR transcription factor."
https://openalex.org/W2938423119,"Based on the Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM), a new integrated Illness Perception Questionnaire Revised for Dental Use in Older/Elder Adults (IPQ-RDE) was developed for single and multiple dental conditions. This study describes psychometric properties of the IPQ-RDE for adults 62 years and older.Participants (n = 198) living in 16 subsidized housing facilities completed the IPQ-RDE and a questionnaire assessing their socio-demographics, frequency of dental visits, perceived condition of teeth/gums, depression, social support, and oral health quality of life (OHQOL). Participants received dental screening for presence/absence of teeth, coronal and root caries, and periodontitis. The 43-item IPQ-RDE was tested for internal (construct, discriminant) and external validity (concurrent, construct, discriminant, predictive) and reliability (internal consistency).Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that a ten-factor model in accordance with the CSM framework (identity, consequences, control, timeline, illness coherence, treatment burden, prioritization, causal relationship, activity restriction, emotional representations) had good construct validity based on significant factor loadings and acceptable model fit (RMSEA = 0.065, CFI = 0.902). Edentulous participants had significantly higher mean factor scores (inaccurate perception) for overall IPQ-RDE and four constructs indicating concurrent validity. Discriminant validity was suggested by non-relationship with external measures (education, dental visit frequency). Predictive validity was indicated by the negative correlation of most constructs with OHQOL suggesting that inaccurate perception was related to lower quality of life. Internal consistency of eight IPQ-RDE constructs was excellent (Cronbach's alpha > 0.73).The IPQ-RDE is a valid and reliable new measure for assessing older adult's perception of dental conditions. It can be an important tool for oral health behavioral research to restructure older adult's perception of dental conditions, and subsequently prevent tooth loss and improve oral health quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2939150622,"The traditional U-turn design has significantly improved traffic operations for relieving traffic congestion. However, the U-turn diversion and merge segments still cause traffic conflicts and delays. In this paper, an exclusive spur dike U-turn lane (ESUL) is proposed with the aim of addressing the disadvantages of the traditional U-turn design. ESUL provides a separate U-turn lane to diverge, decelerate, U-turn, accelerate and merge without interacting with through traffic. The effectiveness of ESUL is demonstrated through a field data investigation, simulation and analysis with VISSIM software. The proposed design is evaluated in terms of three parameters: travel time, delay and number of stops. Compared to the traditional U-turn design, ESUL can reduce travel time by 29.15%, delay by 66.70% and the number of stops by 100% at most. The results showed that ESUL has better performance than the traditional U-turn design and could be implemented to reduce traffic congestion and the potential hazards caused by U-turn maneuvers."
https://openalex.org/W2939196901,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) secretes proteases and peptidases to subjugate its host. Out of its sixty plus proteases, atleast three are reported to reach host macrophages. In this study, we show that Mtb also delivers a lysyl alanine aminopeptidase, PepN (Rv2467) into host macrophage cytosol. Our comparative in silico analysis shows PepNMtb highly conserved across all pathogenic mycobacteria. Non-pathogenic mycobacteria including M. smegmatis (Msm) also encode pepN. PepN protein levels in both Mtb (pathogenic) and Msm (non-pathogenic) remain uniform across all in vitro growth phases. Despite such tight maintenance of PepNs’ steady state levels, upon supplementation, Mtb alone allows accumulation of any excessive PepN. In contrast, Msm does not. It not only proteolyzes, but also secretes out the excessive PepN, be it native or foreign. Interestingly, while PepNMtb is required for modulating virulence in vivo, PepNMsm is essential for Msm growth in vitro. Despite such essentiality difference, both PepNMtb and PepNMsm harbor almost identical N-terminal M1-type peptidase domains that significantly align in their amino acid sequences and overlap in their secondary structures. Their C-terminal ERAP1_C-like domains however align much more moderately. Our in vitro macrophage-based infection experiments with MtbΔpepN-expressing pepNMsm reveals PepNMsm also retaining the ability to reach host cytosol. Lastly, but notably, we determined the PepNMtb and PepNMsm interactomes and found them to barely coincide. While PepNMtb chiefly interacts with Mtb’s secreted proteins, PepNMsm primarily coimmunoprecipitates with Msm’s housekeeping proteins. Thus, despite high sequence homology and several common properties, our comparative analytical study reveals host-centric traits of pathogenic and bacterial-centric traits of non-pathogenic PepNs."

Studied outcomes included the rate and type of premedication, infants' and maternities' characteristics and survival and major neonatal morbidities at discharge from hospital. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed and a generalized estimating equation was used to identify factors associated with premedication use.Out of 1494 included neonates born in 65 maternities, 76 (5.1%) received a premedication. Midazolam was the most used drug accounting for 49% of the nine drugs regimens observed. Premedicated, as compared to non premedicated neonates, had a higher median [IQR] gestational age (30 [28-31] vs 28 [27-30] weeks, p<10-3), median birth weight (1391 [1037-1767] vs 1074 [840-1440] g, p<10-3) and median 1-minute Apgar score (8 [6-9] vs 6 [3-8], p<10-3). Using univariate analyses, premedication was significantly less frequent after maternal general anesthesia and during nighttime and survival without major morbidity was significantly higher among premedicated neonates (56/73 (81.4%) vs 870/1341 (69.3%), p = 0.028). Only 10 centers used premedication at least once and had characteristics comparable to the 55 other centers. In these 10 centers, premedication rates varied from 2% to 75%, and multivariate analysis identified gestational age and 1-minute Apgar score as independent factors associated with premedication use.Premedication rate before tracheal intubation was only 5.1% in the DR of level-3 maternities for premature neonates below 34 weeks of gestation in France in 2011 and seemed to be mainly associated with centers' local policies."
https://openalex.org/W2937783811,"Objective We aimed to refine electroneurogram techniques for monitoring hypogastric nerve activity during bladder filling, and then examined nerve activity in normal intact versus acutely decentralized bladders. Methods Effects of electrical stimulation of hypogastric nerves or lumbar ventral roots on detrusor pressure were examined, as were effects of isoflurane versus propofol anesthetics on hypogastric nerve stimulation evoked pressure. Hypogastric nerve activity was then recorded using custom-made bipolar cuff electrodes during bladder filling before and after its transection between the spinal cord and electrode to eliminate efferent nerve signals. Results Electrical stimulation of hypogastric nerves evoked low amplitude detrusor pressures that did not differ between the two anesthetics. Upper lumbar (L2) ventral root stimulation evoked detrusor pressures were suppressed, yet not eliminated, after transection of hypogastric nerves and all spinal roots below L5. Afferent and efferent hypogastric nerve activity did not change with bladder filling in neuronally intact bladders yet decreased in decentralized bladders. No change in afferent activity was observed during bladder filling in either intact or decentralized bladders. Conclusions These findings indicate that a more complete decentralized bladder model should include transection of lumbosacral spinal roots innervating the bladder as well as hypogastric nerves. These refined electroneurogram recording methods may be suitable for evaluating the effectiveness of nerve transfer surgeries for bladder reinnervation by monitoring sensory activity in the transferred nerve."
https://openalex.org/W2939050383,"p21(WAF1/CIP1/SDI1) is a critical sentinel of the cell cycle that plays an important role in determining cell fate with respect to proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Recent studies have demonstrated that inhibition/loss of p21 promotes osteo-chondro differentiation in progenitor/stem cells, and that p21 knockout (p21-/-) mice demonstrate enhanced bone regeneration compared to wild-type controls after a non-critical size defect. It was therefore hypothesized that the absence of p21 may also protect against bone loss through enhancing bone formation, tilting the balance away from bone resorption, in an ovariectomy-induced osteopenia mouse model, investigated via microCT imaging. While p21-/- mice demonstrated significantly less bone loss after ovariectomy compared to wild-type controls, no increase in the number osteoclasts or osteoblasts in the bone or bone marrow was observed, nor was there an increase in osteoclast activity. Therefore, while the absence of p21 protected mice against estrogen mediated bone loss, the mechanisms/pathways responsible remained elusive. This study demonstrates that p21 may play a significant role in bone remodeling, and a better understanding of how the p21 pathway regulates bone anabolism and catabolism could lead to novel therapies for osteoporosis in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2938620752,"Aim The aim of this study was to ascertain whether mannose binding lectin deficiency is implicated in coexistent rheumatoid arthritis and bronchiectasis and to determine whether undetectable mannose binding lectin confers poorer long-term survival in coexistent rheumatoid arthritis and bronchiectasis or in rheumatoid arthritis in general. Materials and methods A retrospective audit was conducted in a rheumatoid arthritis cohort in which mannose binding lectin had been measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay from 2007–11. Rheumatoid arthritis patients with physician diagnosed HRCT proven bronchiectasis were recruited during this time and compared to those with uncomplicated rheumatoid arthritis. Survival from disease onset was recorded in October 2018. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were performed to assess mortality over time in the two groups. Log rank tests were used for equality of survivor functions. Results The two groups were demographically comparable. A higher frequency of undetectable mannose binding lectin was observed in coexistent rheumatoid arthritis and bronchiectasis (37.5%) compared to uncomplicated rheumatoid arthritis, (8.9%, P = 0.005). Undetectable mannose binding lectin correlated with a strong trend toward poor survival in rheumatoid arthritis overall (P = 0.057). Cox regression analysis however, showed no difference in the hazard ratio for survival between the two groups when corrected for age, gender, prednisolone use ever, rheumatoid factor status and the full range of MBL concentrations. Conclusion In summary, undetectable mannose binding lectin is associated with coexistent rheumatoid arthritis and bronchiectasis and correlates with poor survival in rheumatoid arthritis overall. These findings further implicate immunodeficiency in the genesis of bronchiectasis in rheumatoid arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2937132780,"Objective To evaluate the responsiveness in terms of correlation of the Hospital Universitario La Princesa Index (HUPI) comparatively to the traditional composite indices used to assess disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to compare the performance of HUPI-based response criteria with that of the EULAR response criteria. Methods Secondary data analysis from the following studies: ACT-RAY (clinical trial), PROAR (early RA cohort) and EMECAR (pre-biologic era long term RA cohort). Responsiveness was evaluated by: 1) comparing change from baseline (Δ) of HUPI with Δ in other scores by calculating correlation coefficients; 2) calculating standardised effect sizes. The accuracy of response by HUPI and by EULAR criteria was analyzed using linear regressions in which the dependent variable was change in global assessment by physician (ΔGDA-Phy). Results ΔHUPI correlation with change in all other indices ranged from 0.387 to 0.791); HUPI’s standardized effect size was larger than those from the other indices in each database used. In ACT-RAY, depending on visit, between 65 and 80% of patients were equally classified by HUPI and EULAR response criteria. However, HUPI criteria were slightly more stringent, with higher percentage of patients classified as non-responder, especially at early visits. HUPI response criteria showed a slightly higher accuracy than EULAR response criteria when using ΔGDA-Phy as gold standard. Conclusion HUPI shows good responsiveness in terms of correlation in each studied scenario (clinical trial, early RA cohort, and established RA cohort). Response criteria by HUPI seem more stringent than EULAR’s."
https://openalex.org/W2937314684,"Vitamin D has been reported to affect both innate, and acquired immunity with immune cells such as dendritic cells having the vitamin D receptors. The co-occurrence of the high prevalence of allergic diseases and vitamin D deficiency globally documented in recent decades, has prompted a hypothesis on whether there is a reasonable association between them.To investigate the association between serum vitamin D deficiency and allergic symptoms.Historical cohort. On a cohort study for the association between desert dust exposure and allergic symptoms in 3,327 pregnant women during spring and fall in 2011-2013 in Japan conducted as an adjunct study to the Japan Environment and Children's Study, we promptly acquired subjects' daily allergic symptom scores by sending a web-based questionnaire to each participant on some days. Of the 29,434 answers provided by 3,327 participating pregnant women, we extracted 13,356 answers from 1,475 pregnant women that were answered within a 3-month period after blood samplings. And we measured 25(OH)D levels on those samples to investigate the association between their vitamin D deficiency (serum 25(OH)D < 20ng/mL) and the occurrence of any allergic symptom (allergic symptom score> 0) within 3 months.Serum 25(OH)D was less than 20ng/mL in 1,233 of 1,745 samples (70.7%). The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for occurrence of any allergic symptom in deficient cases compared with non-deficient cases was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.07-1.64, p = 0.01). Further, vitamin D deficiency significantly enhanced the risk increase at desert dust events and at pollen exposure (p-values for interaction <0.1).We confirmed the association between serum vitamin D deficiency and allergic symptoms in Japanese pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W2940045893,"Multivariate analysis methods have been widely applied to decode brain states from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Among various multivariate analysis methods, partial least squares regression (PLSR) is often used to select relevant features for decoding brain states. However, PLSR is seldom directly used as a classifier to decode brain states from fMRI data. It is unclear how PLSR classifiers perform in brain-state decoding using fMRI. In this study, we propose two types of two-step PLSR classifiers that use PLSR/sparse PLSR (SPLSR) to select features and PLSR for classification to improve the performance of the PLSR classifier. The results of simulated and real fMRI data demonstrated that the PLSR classifier using PLSR/SPLSR to select features outperformed both the PLSR classifier using a general linear model (GLM) and the support vector machine (SVM) using PLSR/SPLSR/GLM in most cases. Moreover, PLSR using SPLSR to select features showed the best performance among all of the methods. Compared to GLM, PLSR is more sensitive in selecting the voxels that are specific to each task. The results suggest that the performance of the PLSR classifier can be largely improved when the PLSR classifier is combined with the feature selection methods of SPLSR and PLSR."
https://openalex.org/W2936807189,"The standard treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients is thrombolytic therapy within 60 minutes of a patient's arrival in stroke center hospitals. Based on the policy of the Lampang Referral System Committee, blood samples of suspected stroke patients need to be collected before transfer to the stroke center (Lampang Hospital). It was still questionable as to whether these blood samples are valid for clinical use and the present study aimed to confirm or deny their validity.A diagnostic study was conducted from June 2015 to May 2016. After exclusion, 340 patients were deemed eligible for analysis. Blood samples were collected just before normal saline infusion at referring hospitals and stored in blood collecting tube boxes set during transportation. At the stroke center, informed consents was requested, blood samples were re-collected to serve as a 'gold standard'. Prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), platelet count, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (Cr) were compared using paired t-tests. Binary regression was used to analyze for accuracy (%) to adjust for extraneous influences and was presented by modified Bland-Altman plots.The laboratory results of referring hospitals vs. the stroke center were: PT, 12.4±3.2 vs. 12.5±3.0 sec; INR: 1.0±0.3 vs. 1.0±0.3; and platelet count: 239.8±77.1 vs. 239.8±74.8 (x103/μL). The adjusted accuracy of the PT, INR, and platelet counts were 96.8%, 96.8%, and 95.3% respectively.Laboratory tests from referring hospital were determined to be valid. Blood samples should thus be collected at referring hospitals in order to avoid unnecessary blood collection at the stroke center."
https://openalex.org/W2938810654,"T wave alternans (TWA) is an electrocardiographic marker of heightened sudden death risk from ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with cardiomyopathy. TWA is evaluated from the 12-lead electrocardiogram, Frank lead, or Holter lead recordings, however these clinical lead configurations will not record TWA from adjacent regions of the body torso.We tested the hypothesis that changing heart rate or ventricular activation may alter the body surface distribution of TWA such that the clinical ECG leads fail to detect TWA in some patients; thereby producing a false-negative test.In 28 cardiomyopathy patients (left ventricular ejection fraction 28±6%), 114 unipolar electrograms were recorded across the body torso during incremental atrial pacing, followed by atrioventricular pacing at 100, 110 and 120bpm. TWA was measured from each unipolar electrogram using the spectral method. A clinically positive TWA test was defined as TWA magnitude (Valt) ≥1.9 uV with k ≥3 at ≤110bpm.Maximum Valt (TWAmax) was greater from the body torso than clinical leads during atrial (p<0.005) and atrioventricular pacing (p<0.005). TWAmax was most prevalent in the right lower chest with atrial pacing 100 bpm and shifted to the left lower chest at 120 bpm. TWAmax was most prevalent in left lower chest with atrioventricular pacing at 100 bpm and shifted to the left upper chest at 120 bpm. Using the body torso as a gold standard, the false-negative rate for clinically positive TWA with clinical leads was 21% during atrial and 11% during atrioventricular pacing. Due to TWA signal migration outside the clinical leads, clinically positive TWA became false-negative when pacing mode was switched (atrial→atrioventricular pacing) in 21% of patients.The body surface distribution of TWA is modulated by heart rate and the sequence of ventricular activation in patients with cardiomyopathy, which can give rise to modest false-negative TWA signal detection using standard clinical leads."
https://openalex.org/W2938197355,"We report here on the stability and catalytic properties of the HoLaMa DNA polymerase, a Klenow sub-fragment lacking the 3’-5’ exonuclease domain. HoLaMa was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the enzyme was purified by means of standard chromatographic techniques. High-resolution NMR experiments revealed that HoLaMa is properly folded at pH 8.0 and 20°C. In addition, urea induced a cooperative folding to unfolding transition of HoLaMa, possessing an overall thermodynamic stability and a transition midpoint featuring ΔG and CM equal to (15.7 ± 1.9) kJ/mol and (3.5 ± 0.6) M, respectively. When the catalytic performances of HoLaMa were compared to those featured by the Klenow enzyme, we did observe a 10-fold lower catalytic efficiency by the HoLaMa enzyme. Surprisingly, HoLaMa and Klenow DNA polymerases possess markedly different sensitivities in competitive inhibition assays performed to test the effect of single dNTPs."
